### Leaders ###
POLITICS_NOE_ZHORDANIA_DESC:0 "Like many of his peers, Noe Zhordania emerged from the muddled waters of Georgian nationalism and Marxism, having found a synthesis between the two. In the early 20th century he became well known as an opponent to the merger between the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party with its Georgian counterpart and as a staunch Menshevik, who was personal friends with Karl Kautsky. In 1917 he was elected chairman of the Tbilisi Soviet and denounced the Bolshevik Revolution, thereafter successfully advocating for the creation of a democratic Georgian Republic. He became its first popularly elected prime minister and from this position oriented Georgia’s foreign policy towards the German Empire, utilizing his connections to German politicians in order to gain international recognition, as well as economic and military assistance. Zhordania stopped short of fully acceding to Germany’s demands that Georgia should become a monarchy under a Hohenzollern prince, which he opposed not only due to his republican beliefs, but also because he feared it would make Georgia a de-facto client state to the Kaiserreich. He supervised the creation of the Georgian constitution and forged a historic compromise between the Social Democrats and the National Democrats, to unite behind the common cause of Georgian nationalism, despite their radical ideological differences. This de-facto truce with the conservatives helped Zhordania be re-elected throughout the last 18 years, but in 1935 he announced his decision to soon step down and make room for a younger generation in the Georgian leadership. This came after a period of economic stagnation and numerous ineffectual reforms, which have cast a complicated shadow over Zhordania’s legacy."

POLITICS_IOSIF_BARATOV_DESC:0 "Iosif was born to the princely Baratashvili family in the village of Borbalo. Whilst studying law at the university of St. Petersburg he began to involve himself with radical student politics, and after graduating he took on a number of high profile cases as the defendant for various Georgian nationalists and revolutionaries. He helped found the Social-Federalist party and aligned himself with the Trudovik faction of the Socialist Revolutionaries, supporting them in the Duma after the revolution of 1905. He mostly sought to use the Russian parliament as a platform to raise a number of progressive issues, including Agrarianism, economic relief, combating antisemitism as well as addressing the questions of Georgian autonomy and nationalism, but he failed to gain any meaningful traction among Russia’s political elite. Following Georgia’s independence, he has emerged onto the nation’s political scene as a rather influential figure, beginning to make a career in his own right and now promoting his ideas in earnest, rather than merely petitioning powers greater than him."
POLITICS_MIKHEIL_TSERETELI_DESC:0 ""
POLITICS_EKVTIME_TAKAISHVILI_DESC:0 "Ekvtime was born to a family of minor Georgian nobility in the province of Guria, but was orphaned at a very early age and raised by his siblings, as well as his grandmother. Although initially known as a troublesome child, after Ekvtime went to Petrograd’s University he became recognized as an exemplary student with a passion for history and archeology. His first foray into politics came after he became a teacher in Tbilisi and grew sympathetic to local radical student groups, whilst his passion for Georgia’s long and storied history fostered a great sense of national pride in him. After the February Revolution he signed Georgia’s declaration of independence and became a key member of the conservative National Democratic Party, fearing the growing radicalism of the Social Democratic Party. He served as Deputy Chairman of the Parliament, where he sought to defend the rights of the Georgian church and the peasants, against the growing secularism and urbanisation espoused by the Social Democrats. He is also a principled defender of public education, and an irredentist for Georgia’s historic borders. Despite his aristocratic background, he has been opposed to the influence of the nobility on Georgia’s politics but has also expressed a degree of sympathy for the idea of an apolitical, constitutional monarch who can act as a figurehead for the country. He has also defended the government's ownership of Georgia’s national treasury, preventing famous national treasures and relics from falling into the hands of private collectors."
POLITICS_JOACHIM_VON_PREUSSEN_DESC:0 "Prince Joachim Franz Humbert of Prussia was born in Berlin, on December 17, 1890, two years into the reign of his father Wilhelm II. Like his brothers, he attended elite schools and entered military service, eventually joining the 1st Foot Guards of the Royal Prussian Army, the most prestigious regiment in the German Empire. During the Weltkrieg, he served on the eastern front, but was wounded two months into the war and immediately sent home to Berlin. After returning, Joachim became engaged to the German noblewoman Marie Auguste von Anhalt, marrying her the next year. The couple had one child, Prince Karl Franz Joseph of Prussia, presently known as the Crown Prince Ioseb of Georgia. Joachim became quite a fixation among nascent states during the Weltkrieg, he was suggested as a potential monarch in Ireland, Finland and Poland but in all three cases, he was rejected, or passed up for other candidates. In 1917 the German diplomat Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg and monarchists in the Committee of Independent Georgia sought to install Joachim as king of Georgia, but the government of Noe Zhordania vigorously opposed it. Later, the idea was revived by the conservative general Shalva Maglakelidze and the staunch germanophile Georges V. Matchabelli, who pushed for a referendum on restoring the monarchy. Joachim took the crown and adopted the regnal name Ioachim, but the foreign prince has not made many public appearances, as he is known to be struggling with learning the Georgian language and personal issues related to his mental health. He has still made token efforts to endear himself to the people, and already enjoys a great deal of support among the nobility thanks to Matchabelli."
POLITICS_LEO_SHENGELAIA_DESC:0 "Leo was born in 1887 in the village of Obuji , in the Zugdidi region of Georgia. At an early age he sought an education in law. During his time at university he made contact with radical student groups and became a member of the Socialist Revolutionary party, becoming particularly interested in their programs for educational reform. In 1917 he formed a “Free University” with 5 other comrades, a small private school funded by the SRs, meant to educate the lower classes of Tbilisi. During his time as an administrator at the school he gained recognition for his papers on Georgia’s agrarian and labour issues, which eventually merited him a seat at the National Council of Georgia and a chance to affix his signature to the nation’s declaration of independence. Leo served within the Georgian parliament and steadily rose through the ranks of the SRs until a major schism appeared within the party in 1922, dividing the right leaning Socialist Revolutionaries from their left leaning counterparts. Leo joined the leftist politician Ivan Gobechia and assumed control of the party’s central committee, eventually being confirmed as its official leader a few years later with the left wing of the party’s and Gobechia’s support. He has thereafter served as a cautious supporter of the Social Democratic government of Georgia, unprepared to assume control of the government himself, but undaunted at the prospect of one day doing so."
POLITICS_GIORGI_BAGRATION_DESC:0 "The tale of house Bagration-Mukhrani begins with the rise of the early 16th century prince Bagrat, who was granted the fief of Mukhrani by his brother, the King of Georgia, but eventually rose to assume a great deal of autonomous power and gained de-facto sovereignty over his fiefdom. After the Russian conquest of Georgia, the lords of House Bagration and House Bagration-Mukhrani were regarded as equally powerful, but soon the Mukhrani branch began to gain more and more support in Russian politics, especially among Georgian nationalists. The elder branch of house Bagration eventually died out, leaving the Princes of Mukhrani as the next in line to the Georgian throne. The Bagration-Mukhrani’s claim was officially recognized when the throne was won by George Bagriation in the recent political referendum, restoring the Georgian monarchy. King George IX is considered a rather aloof man, with little political opinions of his own. He has been strongly influenced by his late father, Alexander, who died fighting the Bolsheviks, as well as his son Prince Irakli who is commonly considered a far more capable political schemer. This has left King George as a fairly easily manipulated figure, which frustrates much of the nobility. Nevertheless, the king is still a popular man among the common people. Even if he wasn’t invited as a signee, he gave his endorsement to the Georgian declaration of independence in 1918, and later enlisted as a soldier in the war against the Bolsheviks. It remains to be seen if this untrained, unprepared king can become a man in his own right, or if he will be defined by the influence of his son, his advisors, generals and prime minister."

Georgia’s weak position in the region has left the ruling Mensheviks in desperation to build infrastructure and industry, the central planning put forward by former Bolsheviks was seen as Georgia’s best hope. The SKP however has become very politically active, with members such as Leventi Beria and Ioseb Jughashvili; and many fear that these figures could make moves against the government if not contained.§!"

In the aftermath of Georgian independence, the party mellowed its views to avoid censorship and suppression, and fear of drawing ire from the German hegemon. Both the Mensheviks and SR’s in Georgia have maintained a distance from each other, never entering into an official coalition before, even if such a proposal has often been debated and discussed.§!"

GEO_social_democrat_party:0 "SSDP"
GEO_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Sakartvelos Sotsial-Demokratiuli Partia                   §LThe Social Democratic Party of Georgia, more commonly known as the Georgian Menshevik Party, emerged from two seperate crises in the Georgian nationalist movement. In the late 19th century three groups emerged, fittingly dubbed the First, Second and Third Group, each with different ideas for how Georgian independence should be achieved. The Third Group, under the leadership of Noe Zhordania and Irakli Tsereteli embraced Marxist ideology and sought to meld Georgian nationalism with socialist beliefs. In 1903 the second crisis erupted, when the Third Group voted to join the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, despite the protests of prominent members like Noe Zhordania. This tenuous alliance did not last long, on the advent of the Russian Revolution many Georgia based members of the party decided to end their cooperation with the Russians, although some Georgians like Tsereteli remained faithful to Russian branch of the party. Zhordania emerged as the leader of the newly dubbed SSDP and helped establish an independent Georgian republic, guided by a mixture of socialism, humanism and nationalism, whilst rejecting the more extreme Bolshevik currents that had swept across the Eurasian labour movement.§!"

GEO_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Sakartvelos Sotsialist-Pederalisturi Revolutsiuri Partia §LEstablished in 1904, the Georgian Socialist-Federalist Revolutionary Party was initially derided by many of its leftist peers as a bourgeois party for the propertied class, but in time grew to appeal to both landowners and peasants, with a platform focused on agricultural issues. A critical moment emerged when the party leadership embraced violent revolutionary struggle, in line with the Socialist Revolutionaries’ “Combat Organization”, and began to endorse expropriations and violent reprisals against unjust landowners, despite condemnation from Georgian conservatives. This won them a great deal of support from the lower classes, and helped build a coalition with left-leaning and progressive parties throughout the Russian Empire. Following the Russian Revolution, the SSPRP joined forces with the Georgian social democrats and have been in a coalition ever since, but in time their agrarian focus has caused conflicts with the more urban, labour oriented policies adopted by the social democrats. It remains to be seen if the coalition can endure these disagreements.§!"

In its first few years of existence it was nearly morebund, but in 1917 Spiridon Kedia alongside the elder statesman Niko Nikoladze led a revival of the party, and participated in the first Georgian elections as well as the Georgian provisional government. The party stood for the rights of the peasants, the moderate intellectuals and the traditionalists, against what they deemed to be a tide of radical socialist ideology, sweeping across Georgia. Although unable to stem this tide, the National Democratic Party nevertheless solidified itself as the de-facto leader of the opposition against Noe Zhordania’s Mensheviks, consistently gaining more and more of an edge on him in recent elections. Following Ekvtime Takaishvili’s ascent to party chairman, the National Democrats have also sought to cultivate stronger ties with their fellow agrarian minded parties, and opened up to the possibility of cooperating with Georgian monarchists to secure power.§!"

The Georgian claimant George Bagration is ostensibly a member of the group, but the real mastermind behind the Bagration-Mukhrani dynasty’s activism is his politically savvy son, Irakli. The germanophillic faction is led by the conservative general Shalva Maglakelidze and the eccentric prince Georges V. Matchabelli.

###events

geo.1.t:0 "The Democratic Republic of Georgia"
geo.1.d:0 "Georgia gained its independence during the chaos of the Russian Civil War, following its break from the short-lived Transcaucasian Federation. During the chaos, Georgia went to Germany for help in defending against the enemies surrounding the nation. Georgia signed multiple agreements with Germany, notably the Treaty of Poti, placing the country under the protection of Germany in exchange for several economic concessions which have resulted in a clear German dominance within the economy. Also in the Treaty of Batum, Georgia gave all of its Muslim majority regions to the Ottoman Empire. Following a short conflict with the now dead Republic of Armenia, Georgia lost Lori, and has since remained a peaceful and stable state.\n\nWhile a part of Russia, Georgia was a centre of Menshevik activity, which remained the case when it gained independence, with the Menshehvik Social Democratic Party of Georgia ruling since 1918. Following Noe Ramishvili's brief stint as Chairman in 1918, Noe Zhordania has ruled the country for 18 years solid. The Mensheviks have had complete political dominance over Georgia the whole time, though their vote count has shrunk over the years. In the election of 1935, the Mensheviks almost lost their majority, but were able to keep hold. The National Democratic Party, the EDP, garnered a large amount of votes, with their leader, Ekvtime Takaishvili beginning to work closer with monarchist groups. The popularity for a monarchy has grown over the years, with the two main candidates as king being Prince Joachim of Prussia, son of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and George Bagration, head of the old Georgian royal family, the Bagrationi Dynasty.\n\nGeorgia stands as a beacon of stability in a world of growing uncertainty. Late last year, the old and popular Noe Zhordania announced he would resign as Chairman, to be replaced by Evgeni Gegechkori, who has worked in Zhordania's government since independence, though is notably less popular than him. However, unless disaster were to suddenly strike the nation, nothing is set to change politically until the next election in 1939."
geo.1.a:0 "Georgia Must Survive."
geo.2.t:0 "Re-Examine the Treaty of Poti"
geo.2.d:0 "The Treaty of Poti was signed with Germany when Georgia was under direct threat from most of its neighbours, and wasn't internationally recognised. This is not how things stand anymore. Georgia has strong international recognition, and though tensions grow with its neighbours, some in the country argue that protection is not worth being stuck under the German fist. People specifically point to the fact the Treaty gives Germany great control over Georgia infrastructure, and set up a company that has great control over the Georgia mining industry. Though it would be economically beneficial in the short term, it would alienate our greatest economic partner in Germany, and set us on the anti-German path.\n\nPrince Joachim of Prussia recently announced that, should Georgia suspend the Treaty and nationalise the company, he would refuse any request to be enthroned, stating \"Georgia and Germany need each other\". On the other hand, George Bagration recently announced the opposite, that he would refuse to become monarch should Georgia stand by the Treaty, claiming \"Georgia has lived too long under the fist of Germany. Now is our only chance to stop this.\"\n\nThe foreign policy implications of the decision are massive. By sticking to the treaty, we reaffirm our loyalty to both Germany and, by connection, their strong ally the Ottoman Empire. However, if we were to end the treaty, it would allow us to act more aggressively, and take back territory that our nation claims, like Batum, currently under the control of the Ottomans."
geo.2.d2:0 "The Treaty of Poti was signed with Germany when Georgia was under direct threat from most of its neighbours, and wasn't internationally recognised. This is not how things stand anymore. Georgia has strong international recognition, and though tensions grow with its neighbours, some in the country argue that protection is not worth being stuck under the German fist. People specifically point to the fact the Treaty gives Germany great control over Georgia infrastructure, and set up a company that has great control over the Georgia mining industry. The Chairman is not shy about his hatred for the German Reich, and since his takeover of Georgia from the weak menshevik government, and with Jugashvili in power, he has declared that Georgia shall be free from foreign bindings, not the least of which will be the Treaty of Poti."
geo.2.a:0 "The Treaty is ended, and its company nationalised."
geo.2.b:0 "We cannot alienate the Germans. Bail out the company."
geo.2.c:0 "We no longer need to kowtow to the Reich. Georgia will be Free!."
geo.3.t:0 "The Baku-Poti Pipeline"
geo.3.d:0 "Over the years, since the Ottomans gained control of Batum following the Treaty of Batum, a new pipeline between Georgia and Azerbaijan was built, that being the Baku-Poti Pipeline, made specifically for the transport of oil rather than Kerosene, which is the focus of the Baku-Batum Pipeline. The Baku-Poti Pipeline was funded mostly by the Azeri government, even though a massive amount of it goes through Georgia and the trade from it happened at Poti, in our land. Some of the more nationalistic in our government have suggested that to help finish solving the the Economic Crisis crisis, we should nationalise the Pipeline, and take its profits for ourselves. Relations between Azerbaijan and Georgia have always been tense, stemming mostly from Azeri control of Zaqatala, a city claimed by Georgia.  "
geo.3.a:0 "Nationalise the Pipeline!"
geo.3.b:0 "No need to anger the neighbours."
geo.4.t:0 "Georgia Has Nationalised the Baku-Poti Pipeline!"
geo.4.d:0 "Though our relationship with Georgia has never been strong, they allowed us to invest and contruct a new pipeline, the Baku-Poti Pipeline, through their territory, specifically made for transport of oil. Most of the funding for this pipeline was from our government. However, news has just reached us that the Georgian government has decided to nationalise their part of the pipeline, and take the profits for themselves! This will only boost the already tense relations between our two governments."
geo.4.a:0 "Damn them!"
geo.5.t:0 "The Army's Annual Budget Evaluation"
geo.5.d:0 "With tensions across the world growing more and more, and with the economic crisis of the Economic Crisis hitting the nation, the military commission has decided that it is time to re-evaluate the budget of the military, specifically whether the army should focus more on its defensive or offensive capabilities."
geo.5.a:0 "A more offensive approach is needed."
geo.5.b:0 "Digging in has proven to be the best tactic in the previous wars."
geo.6.t:0 "the Economic Crisis hits our nation!"
geo.6.d:0 "The coup attempt has rendered the Supreme Economic Council, which previously balanced the interests of the Georgian Economy and the German economy useless. Georgia now is in the face of a full blown economic collapse, as differing political factions put forward radically different economic policies, something that has only worsened the political situation. With the SEC gone, our small nation is on the brink of total economic collapse. "
geo.6.a:0 "We must act as soon as possible"
geo.7.t:0 "Food Prices Skyrocketing"
geo.7.d:0 "Since many farmers have left the countryside, and other farmers refuse to sell food cheaply, less food is available in the urban areas, and as such, prices are rising by the hour. A lot of men, women and children can't buy food anymore, because they earn too little, and as such, some have resorted to violent solutions. Shops that sell food are raided almost every day, and police presence isn't enough to stop them. Many vendors have died, and others are too scared to continue with business and have closed their doors, making the situation even worse. "
geo.7.a:0 "You can't change the market"
geo.7.b:0 "Try to establish a food pricing commision"
geo.8.t:0 "Mass Food Riots"
geo.8.d:0 "Following the decision of our government to do nothing against the increased food prices and shortages, food riots everywhere in Georgia have escalated, with reports of people going to the countryside to raid farms for their food. This situation has become almost uncontrollable."
geo.8.a:0 "Who could suspect it was going to be so bad?"
geo.9.t:0 "Establishment of the Agricultural Goods Commision"
geo.9.d:0 "Today the parliament has accepted the proposal to create a food pricing commission to keep prices under control and to provide food for all. Although farmers aren't going to be happy with this, it will prevent a small famine."
geo.9.a:0 "They will do a great job"
geo.10.t:0 "Importing Food?"
geo.10.d:0 "Considering the current unstable situation of our agricultural economic sector, and more so because of the violent food riots that are happening in the cities, many prominent party members have proposed to temporarly import essential foodstuffs to prevent the situation becoming worse. Of course, doing this would most probably stop the food riots, but we need to keep the fact that our state debt will rise significantly if we do this into consideration."
geo.10.a:0 "Agree with the plan"
geo.10.b:0 "This is too risky"
geo.11.t:0 "Food Situation Stabilizes"
geo.11.d:0 "After the government's decision to start importing food from abroad, the shops slowly started to fill again and the overwhelming majority of people is able to feed itself legally once again..."
geo.11.a:0 "This had a price, but it's worth it"
geo.12.t:0 "The Situation Becomes Worse!"
geo.12.d:0 "After the government's decision not to start importing food from abroad, even less food products are available and the people are becoming more violent. We're critisized by almost every other party because of our poor judgement."
geo.12.a:0 "This is really bad"
geo.13.t:0 "Farmers Lower their Prices"
geo.13.d:0 "After the worsening of the food riots, our government reopened talks with the peasantry, this time more willing to make compromises. After many hours of debating between representatives of the SSDP and multiple farmers organisations, the two groups have reached an accord. In exchange for various pro-agrarian measures, the farmers have accepted a lowering of the prices, thus resulting in a stabilisation of the situation in the urban areas."
geo.13.a:0 "Very well"
geo.14.t:0 "Tiflis Protests"
geo.14.d:0 "Thousands of people have gathered in Tiflis this morning, protesting against the leadership of Evgeni Gegechkori, and the rough economic situation they are now in. While some call him a puppet to the Germans, others say he's purposely working against them for personal gain. These protests have been led by multiple of parties in Georgia, everywhere from Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP to Leo Shengelaia's SRs. Though wildly different, they all ask for the same thing: new elections. At the protests, Ekvtime Takaishvili spoke to a large crowd, about how the situation of Georgia has changed since last year, and the current government is unfit to fix it. Evgeni has not commented yet."
geo.14.a:0 "This doesn't look good at all..."
geo.15.t:0 "Noe Zhordania Retires"
geo.15.d:0 "Announced in December last year, Noe Zhordania is stepping down as Chairman of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. He has ruled the nation for 18 years, and under him Georgia has grown close to Germany, and has become a strong and relatively stable nation. However, with his popularity beginning to faulter following some failed reforms and the economy stagnating, Zhordania decided it was his time to retire.\n\nHis replacement, Evgeni Gegechkori, has worked closely with Zhordania over his 18 years of leadership, serving in his cabinet at Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of Justice and Minister for Internal Affairs. Due to the relative stability of Georgia at the current time, and decent economic outlooks, the public should have time to get to like Gegechkori just as much as they like Zhordania."
geo.15.a:0 "Zhordania has served well."
geo.16.t:0 "Tiflis Protests Spread"
geo.16.d:0 "The massive protests in Tiflis have continued a week later, and have began to spread across the country. Protests have grown in Poti and Kutais, calling for the resignation of the government and for new elections. Worse still, George Bagration has joined the protests in Tiflis, calling for \"the end of socialism in Georgia\". Evgeni Gegechkori tried to hold a speech outside the Constituent Assembly earlier today, but protestors stopped this from happening, making Gegechkori look weaker still."
geo.16.a:0 "Could this get any worse?"
geo.17.t:0 "The Minority Situation Worsens"
geo.17.d:0 "The situation with the main minorities of Georgia has worsed greatly. The People's Council of Abkhazia, a council set up representing the Abkhazian people, has officially stated that the central government should call new elections. Protests have increased in Sukhum and Sochi in recent days, feeling empowered with the Council's support.\n\nThings are far worse in South Ossetia, however. Though they have been relatively peaceful since the end of the Ossetian uprisings in 1920, it seems the economic collapse has once again sparked conflict in the area. The Georgian Army have tried to keep the Ossetian revolters down, but the conflict is causing much damage to the area."
geo.17.a:0 "Damn them."
geo.18.t:0 "Pressure Grows on Gegechkori to Call New Elections"
geo.18.d:0 "Pressure on Evgeni Gegechkori to call new elections has been increasing on all sides. Protests continue in Tiflis and across the country, and some industries are talking of strikes against the government. The opposing parties in the Constituent Assembly, led in opposition by Ekvtime Takaishvili, continue to call on the government to resign and for new elections. What is even more worrying, though, is the growth of resistance against Gegechkori by his own party. Multiple cabinet ministers are beginning to speak of how new elections might be best to try to preserve whats left of Georgian stability."
geo.18.a:0 "Maybe elections are necessary."
geo.19.t:0 "Evgeni Gegechkori Calls For New Elections"
geo.19.d:0 "Following the massive uproar throughout the nation against the current government, Chairman Gegechkori has reluctantly decided to call for new national elections in 4 months time. Though it is clear that the SSDP is unlikely to achieve a majority, if it even wins at all, the country could not go on without one."
geo.19.a:0 "It had to be done."
geo.20.t:0 "Protests End and Campaign Begins"
geo.20.d:0 "With the calling of new elections, the protests in Tiflis and across the country have almost completely disappeared, with only a few stragglers left slowly petering out. Construction projects to repair the damage caused by the protests have already begun, as have the campaigns of the political parties.\n\nThe minor parties, the SSRPR, the SR, and the MMEP, are not likely to achieve anywhere close to a majority, and are instead potentially options for coalitions in a possible minority government. The key parties campaigns are the SSDP and the EDP.\n\nGegechkori and the SSDP are running on a continuation of the current system and government, talking about the success Georgia has achieved in the past 18 years. The EDP, on the other hand, are campaigning on the failures of the current government, primarily the failures of the government to quickly deal with the the Economic Crisis crisis. The EDP are also picking up votes with monarchists, after Ekvtime Takaishvili promised that if the EDP win the election, they will hold a referendum on the monarchy."
geo.20.a:0 "Peace returns to Tiflis."
geo.21.t:0 "Prince Joachim Announces Support for the EDP"
geo.21.d:0 "Recently, the popular German prince, Prince Joachim, has announced his support for the Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP. In a statement, he claimed that it is clear that the time for socialism in Georgia has come to an end, and a proper, responsible, conservative government is established, and that the people's voices are heard in regard to a monarchy. Joachim talked about the undeniable successes of the German constitutional monarch system, which has helped them become a global hegemon."
geo.21.a:0 "Too close to Germany, perhaps?"
geo.22.t:0 "George Bagration Announces Support for the EDP"
geo.22.d:0 "Recently, the popular monarchical candidate, George Bagration, has announced his support for Ekvtime Takaishvili's EDP. In a statement, he claimed that the socialism Georgia has been ruled under has led to the constant chaos we have seen for the past few months, and that a proper monarchist, conservative, nationalist government should be established for Georgia to survive."
geo.22.a:0 "Monarchies are too old fashioned."
geo.23.t:0 "Growth in Opposing Left Wing Parties"
geo.23.d:0 "With the SSDP still struggling to gain its popularity back, the other left-wing political parties have begun taking more and more SSDP voters from them. From the right of the SSDP are the SSPRP under Iosif Baratov, a party focused on federalism and decentralisation. To the left of the SSDP are the Georgian SR, a radical party focused on agrarian socialism and the idea of land socialisation, or the division of land to peasant tenants. Though neither party will come close enough to forming a government, their growing popularity along with the SSDP's weakness means its all but assured the SSDP will be forced to form a coalition with one of these parties."
geo.23.a:0 "Splitting the vote?"
geo.24.t:0 "Growth in Polarisation"
geo.24.d:0 "With the collapse of the SSDP hegemony over political power, and the growing chaos both inside and outside the country, polarisation is growing, with more and more people on the outskirts of society supporting more radical parties. On the left, many people, some even former Bolshevik supporters, are beginning to support the SR more and more. On the right, some who believe the EDP do not go far enough are beginning to support the Patriotic Union Tetri Giorgi, a right-wing nationalist party led by former general Leo Kereselidze and professor Mikheil Tsereteli. The group has been rallying for monarchism for years, but are still seen as too radical for most, with the EDP announcing they will refuse to form a coalition with them should they need to."
geo.24.a:0 "Worrying times are ahead."
geo.25.t:0 "EDP and MMEP in Coalition Negotiations"
geo.25.d:0 "The EDP, looking more and more likely to win the upcoming elections, have already entered preliminary coalition talks wtih the MMEP, a landowners party, that had split off the EDP years ago. Due to them seeing eye to eye on most issues, and the fact that though the EDP are likely to win they are unlikely to win a majority of seats, it can be assumed they will form a coalition with Grigory Veshapeli's MMEP."
geo.25.a:0 "They haven't won yet..."
geo.26.t:0 "Evgeni Gegechkori and Noe Zhordania Hold Massive Rally in Tiflis"
geo.26.d:0 "In a last ditch attempt to secure votes for the election only a couple of weeks away, the SSDP has hosted a major rally in the centre of Tiflis, attended by many high level SSDP politicians, including Evgeni Gegechkori and the ever popular Noe Zhordania. Both held speeches, recieving loud cheers from the massive crowds. Though this rally was seen as a massive success, many in the media are calling it too little too late, projecting a close victory for the EDP."
geo.26.a:0 "Could they pull it back?"
geo.27.t:0 "Ekvtime Takaishvili Announces Referendum on the Monarchy"
geo.27.d:0 "Though Ekvtime Takaishvili and the EDP are officially republican, one of the main policies they ran on was a referendum on whether Georgia should become a Constitutional Monarchy. With the popularity of the monarchy growing over the last few years, this policy was one of the main reasons they were able to win the election.\n\nNow, however, comes an important question. Should the EDP and MMEP officially take a side in the referendum? If the government takes a side, and then that side loses the referendum, it’ll destroy the confidence in the government. However, not taking a side could risk a side we disagree with winning."
geo.27.a:0 "Officially side with the Republican Campaign."
geo.27.b:0 "Take no side."
geo.27.c:0 "Officially side with the Monarchist Campaign."
geo.28.t:0 "The Tetri Giorgi Holds Rally in Tiflis"
geo.28.d:0 "Shalva Maglakelidze was a high ranking general of the Georgian military, until he resigned to get more involved in Georgian political life, especially on the side of monarchism. A strong right winger who had always been highly suspicious of the Menshevik Government, he helped found the Tetri Giorgi, a right wing anti-socialist and anti-syndicalist nationalist organisation. Though the group itself is minor, many of its politicians, including its leader Leo Kereselidze and especially Shalva Maglakelidze, are very popular in Georgia, and helped push the idea of monarchism to the forefront of Georgian politics.\n\nToday, the organisation is holding a pro-monarchist rally in Tiflis, attended by thousands of Georgian citizens. It started off peaceful, though throughout the day more and more counter protesters, mostly coming from left wing parties and groups, began to join against the Tetri Giorgi rally. Following a few light clashes between the socialists and monarchists, the police were forced to step in to try to split the groups. However, both sides saw it as the police trying to suppress their side, and so the violence got worse, leading to large brawls between socialists, monarchists and police. By the end of the day, there were many injuries and much damage was done to the city, though thankfully no one died."
geo.28.a:0 "This is worrying..."
geo.29.t:0 "United Socialist Front Forms Against Monarchism"
geo.29.d:0 "Evgeni Gegechkori, the former Chairman of Georgia, has recently announced in Tiflis a \"United Socialist Front\" against monarchism in the country. After entering into negotiations with both the Socialist Revolutionaries and the SSPRP, they all came to an agreement to campaign together against the monarchist campaign. In his speech in Tiflis, Gegechkori discussed how the creation of a Kingdom would undo any progress done by socialism in Georgia, and that any true socialist should be diametrically opposed to the monarchist campaign. He also denounces our holding of a referendum on the topic, claiming it was a cheap attempt to get votes while dividing the country."
geo.29.a:0 "A sore loser."
geo.30.t:0 "The Joachim Interview"
geo.30.d:0 "Recently, an interview of monarchist candidate Prince Joachim of Prussia was published in the largest newspaper in the country. The interview covered his life story and his aspirations for Georgia.\n\nJoachim discusses his early career in the 1st Food Guards of the Royal Prussian Army, and his service on the eastern front. Later he discusses his wife Marie and son Karl, and the massive change in their life living in Georgia was. He even discusses his own mental health and struggles with the Georgian language. When asked if it was the right time for Georgia to become a monarchy, with tensions in the world growing, Joachim asserted that this was the best time for it. He claimed that the the monarchy can be a point of stability following months of political chaos, and his connections to the Germans allows Georgia to grow closer to the world hegemon.\n\nThough some see Joachim's poor mental health and struggling with the Georgian language as weak, most of the country is sympatheic, and like the honesty and boldness for him to discuss this. His popularity has skyrocketed with this interview."
geo.30.a:0 "But do we want a German on the Georgian throne?"
geo.31.t:0 "The George Interview"
geo.31.d:0 "Recently, an interview of monarchist candidate George Bagration of Mukhrani and his son Irakli was published in the largest newspaper in the country. The interview covered his life story and his aspirations for Georgia.\n\nGeorge discusses his early life, as part of the Russian nobility, and his military education at the Page Corps. He talks about his history of involvement in Georgia and struggles for the Georgian cause, including his fighting against the Bolsheviks during the Russian Civil War. On the issue of politics, George discussed how the monarchy should be an apolitical body in the country, and stated his son Irakli was more political, to which he agreed. Irakli went on to say how the monarchy should act as a point of stability in the country, and should be able to \"correct the course of the country should it go too far\".\n\nThough George himself came off quite well in the interview, controversy has started over the comments of his son. His statement about \"correcting the course\" has been seen by many as an affront to democracy, and they claim that Irakli does not really want a constitutional monarchy, just more power. Still, George remains quite popular, especially within right-wing circles, who venerate George's military experience against the Bolsheviks and in many ways agree with the statements of his son."
geo.31.a:0 "Do they want democracy?"
geo.32.t:0 "Referendum on the Monarchy"
geo.32.d:0 "Finally, after weeks of campaigning and political violence, it is time for a referendum on the monarchy. The people of Georgia have come out in droves today, and it looked to be close. In the end, however, victory went to..."
geo.32.a:0 "...the Monarchists."
geo.32.b:0 "...the Republicans."
geo.33.t:0 "Socialists March in Tiflis"
geo.33.d:0 "After hearing the results of the monarchy referendum, socialists across the country were furious. Important republican leaders, including former chairmen Noe Zhordania and Evgeni Gegechkori, denounced the results and the referendum as a whole. Now, the day after the referendum, thousands of people have flocked to the streets of Tiflis to protest against the fact that their country has been turned into a kingdom. Fiery speeches by Zhordania caused the crowd to begin to turn violent, with some vandalism and clashes with police taking place later into the day. There were even rumours that Valiko Jugheli, a prominant member of the SSDP who is also a general of the country, was in Tiflis supporting the protestors. It seems things will get worse in Georgia before they get better."
geo.33.a:0 "But it's the will of the people!"
geo.34.t:0 "Valiko Jugheli Reforms the People's Guard"
geo.34.d:0 "The People's Guard of Georgia was a volunteer force, mainly made up of Mensheviks, in the early days of Georgia's independence. It was dissolved after control of Georgia was secure, and Germany guaranteed Georgia's independence. However, Valiko Jugheli, former commander of the People's Guard, has recently announced that with the monarchy winning the referendum, Georgia is under threat once again, and that the People's Guard must be reformed. He also earlier that day resigned his post as a general in the army. Already, thousands of socialists have joined the rank of the People's Guard, and there are now fears Jugheli wishes to perform a coup in Tiflis, to restore an SSDP-led republican government, and ignore both the democratic elections and democratic referendum that have taken place."
geo.34.a:0 "Jugheli is a danger to Georgia."
geo.35.t:0 "General Kakutsa Cholokashvili Meets With King George"
geo.35.d:0 "Kakutsa Cholokashvili, a general of the Georgian army, has recently met with King George Bagration and his son Irakli. In the meeting, Cholokashvili has stated that with chaos ruling in Tiflis, and with Jugheli's People's Guard arming themselves, it might be time to step in and stop this. Cholokashvili spoke vaguely about his plans, talking about \"protecting Georgia\" and \"temporarily taking control\" but it was clear what he was suggesting: a coup. Cholokashvili said he had certain areas of the army on his side, and he could quickly move into Tiflis, remove the current government and secure the city. From there, Georgia would still be under external threat, and so his new administration should remain in power for the forseeable future. Cholokashvili also states that he has civilian support from the highly nationalistic Tetri Giorgi. Cholokashvili is suggesting a strange mix of absolute monarchy, military dictatorship and nationalists autocracy, a coalition between the monarchy, the military and the Tetri Giorgi. A plan like this could end democracy in Georgia forever. It is George and Irakli's decision as to whether Cholokashvili moves forward with the plan."
geo.35.a:0 "Go ahead with the plan."
geo.35.b:0 "How dare he even suggest such a thing!"
geo.36.t:0 "Kakutsa Cholokashvili Takes Tiflis"
geo.36.d:0 "Early in the morning, while most of the country still slept, Kakutsa Cholokashvili readied his forces and moved into Tiflis. His troops moved quickly, securing the entrances and exits of the city and taking government buildings. His troops also surrounded the houses of Noe Zhordania and Evgeni Gegechkori, placing them under house arrest. By the time Prime Minister Ekvtime Takaishvili was awake, it was already too late, as the government was already under Cholokashvili's control. Takashvili quickly announced his resignation, and King George appointed Cholokashvili as the new Prime Minister of Georgia, who suspended the constitution and dissolved Parliament."
geo.36.a:0 "Democracy is dead in Georgia."
geo.37.t:0 "Riots Through Tiflis"
geo.37.d:0 "Riots have occured all throughout Tiflis, with armed shootouts with police against Jugheli's People's Guard. So far there have been 4 deaths, and much damage has been done. However, signs are beginning to show that the chaos might be coming to an end. More and more people are beginning to leave the protests and return to work, accepting the fact their country is now a monarchy. Though many radicals joined Jugheli's People's Guard, not many of them actually showed up to fight in Tiflis, most likely not willing to risk their lives to fight for a result which most of the country voted for. It seems we might have gotten past the peak of the anti-monarchist protests."
geo.37.a:0 "A light at the end of the tunnel."
geo.38.t:0 "Last Protestors Disperse in Tiflis"
geo.38.d:0 "Following weeks of protests and riots in Tiflis due to the referendum on the monarchy, the last of the protestors have finally dispersed, and stability has returned to Tiflis. Though the monarchy decision will remain an extremely divisive topic, and there will always be controversy surrounding it, the violence and vandalism has ended."
geo.38.a:0 "Thank goodness."
geo.39.t:0 "Jugheli's People's Guard Revolt"
geo.39.d:0 "Valiko Jugheli has announced today that, with Tiflis falling to the ''reactionary forces of the King and General Cholokashvili'', it was time for his People's Guard to revolt against the government, to try and take the country back. He has retreated from Tiflis, and has taken the city of Kutais. A detachment of his People's Guard have also taken Abkhazia, and another is trying to take Poti, though the garrison there is giving them trouble. It seems a civil war has begun."
geo.39.a:0 "We fight for Georgia."
geo.40.t:0 "Siege of Kutais"
geo.40.d:0 "Kutais is one of the most important cities in the country, being both one of the most populus and most industrialised. Jugheli has control of the city, after defeating the small garrison there. To take back the city, we have 2 options. The Rioni river runs directly through the city, and we have control of it slightly up stream. One of our officers suggested we send a small group of our elite troops down the river in rafts into the city, as a sneak attack. However, many in the military believe that a small group of troops will not be enough, and that the best course of action is to march a large army into the city, to fight the People's Guard garrison head on, and defeat them with superior numbers and weapons. In regard to the river plan, there are also worries that if the weather deteriorates, our troops will be unable to control their rafts, and will be unorganised and easily repelled."
geo.40.a:0 "Send an elite force down the river."
geo.40.b:0 "March a large force into the city."
geo.41.t:0 "Troops Defeated in Kutais"
geo.41.d:0 "In the middle of the night, government troops were sent down the Rioni river, to suprise attack the People's Guard garrison. However, as they sailed down the river, a storm rolled in, and the river became violent. Some men's rafts were damaged or even destroyed, while others were beached. By the time they reached the city, they were unorganised, and some of their equipment and weapons were damaged by the water and harsh conditions. The People's Guard garrison in the city was easily able to pick off and defeat our troops. This is a major defeat for the government."
geo.41.a:0 "Damn."
geo.42.t:0 "Government Forces take Kutais"
geo.42.d:0 "Marching a large amount of forces into the city seemed to be the right decision, for as the day went on, a storm rolled in, meaning the river would have been dangerous. Our mass of troops was able to quickly overrun the weak People's Guard garrison, and successfully regain control of the city."
geo.42.a:0 "Excellent."
geo.43.t:0 "Siege of Sukhum"
geo.43.d:0 "Next comes the question of taking the city of Sukhum, the capital of the region of Abkhazia. The People's Guard has a relatively strong presence in the city, and the people are unlikely to cooperate with government forces much. Plans to take the city have been brought forward by multiple different officers. The city is a major port on the Black Sea, and there are many ships in the port currently. Some officers suggest that our forces should focus on taking the port first, then move into the city itself, to stop the People's Guard troops from retreating out of the city. However, other officers have said that this is too risky, and that cornering the People's Guard inside the city will force our troops to fight all their forces at once to their deaths. However, if we allow the People's Guard the opportunity to retreat, they will fight less vigorously and will be quick to retreat. Most of our officers agree with the plan to take the city itself first, instead of the port."
geo.43.a:0 "Take the main city first, then move to the port."
geo.43.b:0 "Take the port first, then move into the city."
geo.44.t:0 "People's Guard Troops Retreat from Sukhum"
geo.44.d:0 "Battles were fought in the streets of Sukhum as our troops entered from the north. Our troops were able to quickly push them back to the port, where they made their escape on the ships there. Though they were able to retreat, it allowed us to easily retake the city."
geo.44.a:0 "Perfect."
geo.45.t:0 "Government Troops Defeated in Sukhum"
geo.45.d:0 "The siege of Sukhum looked like it was going perfectly, as our troops moved in from the east and quickly took control of the port. However, as our troops pushed further into the city, they faced extremely harsh resistance from the People's Guard. Our troops got around halfway through the city before they were forced back due to the sheer resistance from the People's Guard. As time went on, our troops got pushed further and further back, eventually being pushed back all the way to the port. The People's Guard pushed back harder and harder, and eventually our forces were forced to retreat in the boats in the port. Sukhum seems to be under Jugheli's control."
geo.45.a:0 "That didn't go well."
geo.46.t:0 "Battle of Poti"
geo.46.d:0 "A small battle still rages at the port city of Poti in the west. Our forces control the city for now, but there are regular skirmishes from the People's Guard, and a large force is amassing just outside the city to take it. We must get troops to Poti as quickly as possible. We have some leftover troops from Sukhum, but it will take a while to organise them and send them down. In contrast, we have some troops further up the Caucasian Railway, which ends in Poti. Many of our officers are suggesting we send our troops down it to reach Poti in time and lift the siege."
geo.46.a:0 "Send troops down the Caucasian Railway."
geo.46.b:0 "No need to use the railway, send the forces from Sukhum."
geo.47.t:0 "Poti is Saved"
geo.47.d:0 "Our support down the Caucasian Railway arrived at Poti just mere hours before the People's Guard moved in to take the city. Thankfully, after a long fought battle, our forces were able to keep the city and push back the People's Guard troops."
geo.47.a:0 "Perfect."
geo.48.t:0 "Poti is Lost"
geo.48.d:0 "Our support appeared to arrive too late to Poti. As our troops arrived from Sukhum, they found the city had already fallen to the forces of the People's Guard. They tried to push in, but were quickly repelled. It seems Poti is lost."
geo.48.a:0 "We will return!"
geo.49.t:0 "Jugheli Approaches Tiflis"
geo.49.d:0 "Valiko Jugheli, leader of the People's Guard, has been seen marching towards Tiflis, leading a large force to take the capital. The government garrison left in Tiflis is quite small, and he might be able to take it if he's able to get support from other cities he's taken. It'll be a close battle for the future of the country."
geo.49.a:0 "Maybe the future will be brighter..."
geo.50.t:0 "People's Guard Defeated"
geo.50.d:0 "The large force led by Valiko Jugheli was met outside Tiflis, by our larger, more well supplied force. In the fighting, following an artillery barrage, it is assumed Jugheli was killed, and if he escaped he would be easily hunted and captured. With this victory, our government is secure. We can now start implementing our plans, and forming an alliance with the civilian Tetri Giorgi."
geo.50.a:0 "For Georgia!"
geo.51.t:0 "Jugheli and the People's Guard Take Tiflis!"
geo.51.d:0 "When Jugheli's force arrived outside Tiflis, it had gained strength and supplies from the other cities of the nation. Comparatively, government troops were undersupplied and lacked morale. Many of them even defected to the People's Guard before the battle began. After a few hours of battle, the government forces were defeated, and Jugheli's troops marched into Tiflis, and he took over the government. Kakutsa Cholokashvili, George Bagration and his son Irakli were arrested. In a speech outside parliament, Jugheli declared Georgia a republic once more, and that he would lead a coalition of of the SSDP, SR and SSPRP until proper elections can be held."
geo.51.a:0 "Georgia is free!"
geo.52.t:0 "What to do with Cholokashvili and the Bagrations"
geo.52.d:0 "With control now secure of the government, a question must be answered: what to do with the criminals who tried to end Georgian democracy. Primarily, the question focuses on Kakutsa Cholokashvili, George Bagration and his son Irakli. Of course they must be punished, their crimes are treason against Georgia. However, some argue that it would be best to only lightly punish them, by putting them under house arrest. This will show how our administration is willing to be forgiving, and that we are not fighting for revenge, but for the betterment of the country."
geo.52.a:0 "They committed treason, they deserve life in prison."
geo.52.b:0 "Be nice, give them house arrest."
geo.53.t:0 "Integrate the People's Guard"
geo.53.d:0 "The forces of the People's Guard served us well in overthrowing the dictatorial monarchist government. Though they were not the most well trained troops, they showed true support for key Georgian values, like democracy and republicanism. The process has now started to integrate these troops into the army itself, to help dilute Cholokashvili's supporters and end another potential dictatorship, should another arise."
geo.53.a:0 "They fought well."
geo.54.t:0 "Strengthen Political Institutions"
geo.54.d:0 "Now, Valiko Jugheli has declared it time to reinforce the political institutions of the country, to try and avoid another monarchist dictatorship. Firstly, he passed a law that stated Georgia would always be a republic, to give the monarchy no chance of taking power once again. The Constitution of 1921, a work of constitutional art, was reviewed, but was decided it still worked and was not the reason Cholokashvili and Bagration were able to take over. Jugheli instead blames the courts made to defend the constitution. He dismissed any judges that tried to give Cholokashvili's regime legitimacy, and emphasised it is the courts that must protect the political institutions of Georgia."
geo.54.a:0 "Georgia will always be a republic!"
geo.55.t:0 "Jugheli Announces New Elections"
geo.55.d:0 "Today, in a speech outside parliament, Valiko Jugheli announced to a large crowd of people that new elections would be held in a months time. He claimed that the EDP, by allowing the referendum, was partly responsible for the dictatorial takeover, and therefore the people deserve to vote once again on a new parliament. The announcement was met with cheering by the crowd, happy to see that democracy was once again going to take place in the country."
geo.55.a:0 "Excellent."
geo.56.t:0 "Georgia turns their back on Germany"
geo.56.d:0 "The Democratic Republic of Georgia was born with sponsorship from the German Empire. To secure their independence in the turbulent times of the Russian Revolution, the Georgian government signed the Treaty of Poti, a treaty that gave Germany vast economic power in the country. In the wake of the the Economic Crisis crisis and the collapse of the Georgian economy, Georgia has decided to declare the Treaty of Poti at an end, and has instead decided to take an anti-German stance, using nationalism to gather support for their government. Some of the more jingoistic in their government have even discussed retaking Batum from us."
geo.56.a:0 "Something to keep an eye on."
geo.57.t:0 "Georgia Mobilises for War!"
geo.57.d:0 "With war breaking out in the Middle East, the Georgian government has ramped up its attacks against the Empire in speeches, proclaiming that Georgians suffering under Ottoman rule will soon be \"freed\". This, along with a sudden influx of troops on the border, can only mean one thing: Georgia will soon declare war on the Empire."
geo.57.a:0 "Damn."

geo.60.t:0 "The King's Cabinet"
geo.60.d:0 "With the country now securely under our new regimes control, it is now time to create a cabinet for the country, made up of our allies.\n\nKakutsa Cholokashvili, who brought about the new government, will remain in his position as Prime Minister. King George's son, Prince Irakli, assisted in the coup, and is far more politically active and able than his father. He will become Foreign Minister. Shalva Maglakelidze is a retired general, now one of the most popular of the Tetri Giorgi. A Germanophile and extreme nationalist, he wants the role of Minister of the Interior, but it was decided he is far too ideological for the position. Better off to put him in a high level position where he cannot too heavily influence the ideology of the government. Therefore, he will become the Economy Minister. Leo Kereselidze is another ex-general, who led the Georgian Legion in the First Weltkrieg. Leader of the Tetri Giorgi, it is decided he will become Minister of the Interior."
geo.60.a:0 "An excellent government."
geo.61.t:0 "Georgia Requests to Join the Reichspakt"

geo.64.d.not_AZE:0 "Georgia has claimed the town of Zaqatala for decades, but in the post-1st Weltkrieg agreement, Azerbaijan gained control of it. However, now Georgia has come to us, requesting we hand the town over to them.

geo.67.d:0 "The People's Council of Abkhazia, the devolved body established in the early days of the republic to represent the Abkhaz people, has recently held it local elections across the Abkhazia region. The establishment of the People's Council allowed the Abkhaz people to not feel intimidated or threatened by the central government, and to give them a voice in their region. The elections took place without a hitch, with more left-wing nationalist groups gaining control of the council."

geo.68.t:0 "Autonomy Question for South Ossetia"
geo.68.d:0 "With the elections to the People's Council of Abkhazia a few weeks ago, people in the region of South Ossetia have begun to ask themselves why they do not have their own devolved body. Following the South Ossetian uprisings that ended in 1920, the region of South Ossetia had been relatively peaceful, and self determination for the South Ossetian people faded to an obscure idea only held by intellectual circles. However, following the economic and subsequent political disasters in 1936, tensions once again flared up in the region, and with many remembering the violence of the early days of the republic, the a military detachment was sent to the region all the way until the election. Now that the people of Abkhazia have exercised their local democracy, the question that is beginning to enter the mainstream is whether the South Ossetian people deserve the same."

geo.69.d:0 "The minor groups that have been fighting for South Ossetian autonomy seem to have finally broken into the mainstream, with mass support for a pro-autonomy march that has taken place in Tskhinvali, the capital of the South Ossetian region. Though there was no violence between protesters and police, there are fears that if demonstrations like this continue, more extremist elements of this movement might enter the mainstream."

geo.72.t:0 "South Ossetians Begin to Arm Themselves"
geo.72.d:0 "After being endorsed by the People's Council of Abkhazia, many South Ossetians assumed that autonomy was on the way. When this desire for autonomy was rejected by our government, many have instead come to the conclusion that a crackdown in the region was on the way. Therefore, many South Ossetians in the region, remembering the multiple conflicts that have occurred in the region, have begun to arm themselves with weapons smuggled in from the north. There is still a chance to end any danger of conflict if autonomy for the region is announced. Instead, it'd be a good idea to increase the military presence there."

After a few hours of protests in Tskhinvali, a fire was started, which, after being blamed on the protesters, led to clashes between military police and protesters. The situation quickly deteriorated, and a riot quickly broke out. During clashes throughout the night, many people were injured, and three rioters were killed. With news of the deaths spreading across the South Ossetian region, tensions have flared, and we should expect a reaction from the people."

Though the military presence there was able to quickly pacify the attackers, it led to the deaths of 13 South Ossetians and 4 Georgian troops. It is clear that something drastic must be done to defuse the situation. We could finally give in to the South Ossetians demands for autonomy, or crack down on them hard, to finally crush any desire for autonomy by force."

kx_geo.1.d:0 "The Georgian state was formally established in 1918 after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, and the nation found itself surrounded by the immediate chaos of the Russian Civil War. Georgia quickly became a stronghold for the Menshevik Party, while managing to fend off the invasion from the Bolshevik forces in the Civil War. The now ruling Menshevik party banded together with several Bolshevik and Social Revolutionary figures to form a new 'Caucasian' brand of Socialism, which formed a new parliament. Into the 1920's, the country's industrial base developed surprisingly well, with major Bolshevik figures being granted significant sway over the nation’s economy. Soon after, the Georgian Communist Party was formed, with Ioseb Jugashvili as its leader. Though being banned throughout the decade of stable growth and economic dependence on Germany, the Communist Party has gained vast popularity among both peasants and Georgian nationalists.\n\nWhatever the future may hold, the future of Georgia is without a doubt uncertain."

In 1931, Jughashvili was appointed General Secretary of the Supreme Economic Council, allowing him to be very influential in the government, pushing for industrialisation and creating an immense bureaucratic administration to control the country whilst promoting fierce Georgian nationalism. By 1936, the Supreme Economic Council that de facto governs the Georgian government is firmly under the control of Jughashvili, and he is in a position to effectively seize control of the government. The Mensheviks control has collapsed and a new era for Georgia is beginning. Georgian Socialism shall shape this nation's future."

Even more surprising is rumours of anti-socialist dissidence. Therefore it has been an immediate priority of Jugashvili to have his comrades seize control of the military hierarchy.\n\n Last night Lavrentiy Beria along with several hundred members of the People's Guard marched into the Georigan Armed Forces headquarters in Tbilsi. Honourable Georigan soldiers upon seeing Beria and his men opened the gates and under the orders of Beria arrested the generals suspected of holding potentially tratorious views.

kx_geo.7.t:0 "People's Guard face resistance"
kx_geo.7.d:0 "The territories of Armenia and Azerbaijan are now under tight fisted occupation at the behest of Chairman Jugashvili. The People’s Guard has been tasked with restoring order to the chaotic lands wrecked by war, a strenuous task on its own, however the formation of ethnic militancies loyal to the former governments have launched counter insurgencies on newly garrisoned outposts across Transcaucasia. Luckily for the People’s Guard these militants are severely lacking coordination and moral, we shall make quick work of these rebels."
kx_geo.7.a:0 "We shall crush this resistance!"
kx_geo.8.t:0 "Charge of the Cossacks!"
kx_geo.8.d:0 "The proud warrior people of the steppes have long been a pawn to Russian imperialism leaving their homeland, little more than a stepping stone from Russia to Transcaucasia. Georgia remembers when the Cossacks took up arms with both the Whites and Germans, proud puppets to greater powers they were delighted when their masters allowed for the formation of the Don-Kuban Republic. Since then they have threatened the stability of this region with ethnic conflict and encroaching Russian expansion seemingly unnaposed. \n\n As the Cossacks once more charge into battle, sabers raised and horses steady, it will be seen how these archaic warriors of a dead era survive against the crushing tide of modern nationalism and socialism."
kx_geo.8.a:0 "Half a league, half a league, half a league onward...."
kx_geo.9.t:0 "The Orthodox Church of Georgia"
kx_geo.9.d:0 "The Georgian Orthodox Church is an ancient structure that can date itself back to the 5th Century, to the greater populace the teachings of Christ are intrinsically linked to their way of life. Although no longer a religious man, Jugashvili can remember a time when as a young boy he too served the word of Christ. It is because of this that the situation of the Church is one of great sensitivity, whilst it provides unity for the people it also serves as a powerful entity that does not submit itself to the Chairman. Nor does it renounce its communion with other Churches within nations hostile to us. We must decide the fate of the Church, do we maintain its enormous presence in society or listen to the socialist influences of those who oppose it?"
kx_geo.9.a:0 "The church is an integral part of Georgian culture!"
kx_geo.9.b:0 "The church spreads division and false worship, we shall put an end to these oppressors!"
kx_geo.10.t:0 "Persecution of the Orthodox Church"
kx_geo.10.d:0 "Not only does the Catholicos-Patriarch insult the Chairman with his defiance by refusing to cut ties with the Russian Communion, he has the gall to state that his duty to Christ is greater than his duty Georgian Socialism! The Chairman addressed the nation stating, ‘For too long has the church suckled off the teat of the nation! Reaping the rewards earned from the sweat off the worker’s brow! Enough!”\n\nBy Jugashvili’s new orders the church is to confiscate all property to the state, if they do not comply the state shall take it with force. The People’s Guard are prepared to raid churches across the nation, meanwhile in Tiflis and other cities angry crowds of workers defy the word of Christ. Striking priests down and crushing their crosses, Jugashvili is all the matters to them now..."
kx_geo.10.a:0 "The Orthodox Church is antiquated, we shall use its wealth for the state."
kx_geo.11.t:0 "The Menshivik Question"
kx_geo.11.d:0 "When Russia collapsed into civil war the Georgian Menshevik Party quickly took advantage of the power vacuum left and seized control, declaring Georgia an independent nation. The Mensheviks however lacked enough support and power to effectively lead the nation after the civil war, for this reason they entered into an alliance with Bolshevik exiles. Under the new leadership of the former Bolshevik, Sergo Ordzhonikidze, he attempted to appease both factions whilst centralising Georgia as a semi-authoritarian state. Since Jugashvili’s coup Sergo has mostly been sidelined along with many Menshevik figures, although no solid proof of disloyalty exists it is obvious that these politicians wish for revenge.\n\nShould we forge documents and enforce testimonies proving disloyalty or simply have Beria deal with them?"
kx_geo.11.a:0 "Allow for Beria to discretely take care of them..."
kx_geo.11.b:0 "We shall bring them to trial and make a public example out of them."
kx_geo.12.t:0 "Beria's henchmen dispose of Menshivik leadership"
kx_geo.12.d:0 "Beria under direct orders from Chairman Jugashvili had members of the People’s Guard kidnap notable members of the Menshevik Party from their homes in early hours of the morning. Grigol Orzdzhonikidze, Isidore Ramishvili, Noe Ramishvili, Noe Khomeriki and Nikolay Chkheidze were dragged into a secure bunker beneath the streets of Tiflis. Brought before Beria, he charged them all with treason stating to their complete surprise they had attempted a counter-coup to take place. Uncaring to the crying pleas of innocence, Beria ordered his men to line them up against a wall and fill them with lead..."
kx_geo.12.a:0 "A problem no more."
kx_geo.13.t:0 "The Menshivik Trials"
kx_geo.13.d:0 "Grigol Orzdzhonikidze along with important Mensheviks such as Isidore Ramishvili, Noe Ramishvili and Nikolay Chkheidze have been brought in front of the People’s Court. Charged with treason, planning an attempted coup and promoting civil disorder the court has demanded a justifiable defence to be provided by state assigned lawyers. The court has also suggested several punishments to be decided by Jugashvili himself.\n\nGrigol’s defence has claimed that he is a loyal comrade of Jugashvili, stating their extensive friendship since their days as Bolsheviks. He has also claimed that documents detailing a planned coup were forged by Beria, according to the Menshevik defence this whole ordeal has been planned by Beria in an attempt to expand his power. Despite these claims Beria assured the court that his evidence was bullet proof in its authenticity and that statements provided by Sergo should be assumed as false. The court too found the defence questionable, citing eyewitness accounts of Menshevik officials meeting with suspected Russian spies.\n\n After much consideration the court reached the conclusion of guilty for all those accused, they have submitted their justification to Jugahsvili, now it is up to him to decide the defendants’ fate."
kx_geo.13.a:0 "They have provided a satisfactory defence, they will only be removed from government positions and put under house arrest."
kx_geo.13.b:0 "Their defence does not prove them completely innocent of disloyalty, 25 years hard labour!"
kx_geo.13.c:0 "We will not allow for the Menshiviks to make any more claims of innocence, execute them!"
kx_geo.14.t:0 "Russian language banned."
kx_geo.14.d:0 "As part of continuing attempts by the Chairman to decrease outside influence on the nation, the Russian language which has been commonly used throughout Georgia’s history, has been banned. Those found to be speaking Russian in public as well as the distribution of material printed in Russian are to be fined, repeated offenders will be sentenced to forced labour. Meanwhile minority communities are being targeted by state educational forces who have the task of spreading the use of the Georgian language to as many as possible."
kx_geo.14.a:0 "All Russian influence will be crushed!"
kx_geo.150.t:0 "A Show of Strength"
kx_geo.150.d:0 "Luckily Russia is positioned some distance away, the same cannot be said for our enemy in the south. The Ottomans share a direct border with us stretching across the nation’s weakest natural defence. It is only a matter of time before the Ottomans attempt some form of geopolitical aggression in order to tame us. Therefore the Chairman’s advisors have suggested striking first, proving to the Turks that we will not go down without a fight. It is no secret that the empire’s power has declined much since the Weltkrieg.\n\n Either we could launch surprise raids and attacks on Ottoman settlements and convoys to further weaken their position in the region, such attacks would be disguised as random bandit attacks. Or the more extreme option, launch a full invasion of the Lazistan region, home to many ehtnic Georgians likely to support our cause."
kx_geo.150.a:0 "Order the People's Guard to launch an insurgency on the border!"
kx_geo.150.b:0 "The Ottomans are weak! March into Lazistan!"
kx_geo.151.t:0 "People's Guard of Georgia are victorious!"
kx_geo.151.d:0 "Disguised as mercenaries and bandits, People’s Guardsmen attacked settlements and outposts across our southern border. The rapid movement of Guardsmen launching attacks was too much for the stationed Ottoman military causing them to retreat from the region. Such a defeat is shocking for them!"
kx_geo.151.a:0 "A humiliating defeat for the Ottomans."
kx_geo.152.t:0 "Ottomans resist insurgency!"
kx_geo.152.d:0 "The attacks failed! We underestimated the resilience of the Ottomans, despite being caught by surprise and lacking reinforcements they managed to push back our forces and defend the border. Despite no official connections to the government, this defeat of clearly Georgian soldiers has shown great weakness, a weakness the Ottomans are unlikely to forget."
kx_geo.152.a:0 "A definite strike to Jugashivili's ego."
kx_geo.153.t:0 "The Occupation of Lazistan"
kx_geo.153.d:0 "The region of Lazistan is home to a large populace of Georgians, as the Georgian military marched through fallen Ottoman checkpoints they were welcomed by residents loyal to Jugashvili. The strength of our military is superior to that of the Turks, we shall have the entire region under our control in little time."
kx_geo.153.a:0 "We shall resist the vile Turks!"
kx_geo.154.t:0 "Wealth Collection"
kx_geo.154.d:0 "The Supreme Economic Council successfully drafted and passed the, “Reduction of Non-Essential Ownership Law”. This has allowed for the state to collect all private wealth deemed non-essential to the living standard of citizens, this wealth will then be used to fund state projects. Citizens already lost the right to private property and with the law being enforced by the militant People’s Guard it is unlikely that we shall face resistance. More importantly is the decision of where a portion of this new found wealth should go, it would be wise to reward loyal government members however such transfer of money could provide them with more power. On the hand the Chairman could keep it all for himself to ensure the rightful distribution of cash flow."
kx_geo.154.a:0 "The Chairman is most responsible."
kx_geo.154.b:0 "Loyalty has its rewards."
kx_geo.155.t:0 "Cult of Jugashvili"
kx_geo.155.d:0 "The streets of Tiflis were alive with red flags, cheering and the marching of soldiers. Gravitating around an impressive marble statue of the Chairman were hundreds of imposing guardsmen chanting the Georgian national anthem. And from a Tiflis Palace balcony stood Jugashvili, admiring all that he had built. Whilst it seemed that the rest of the world was tearing itself apart, in this moment overlooking his loyal populace naive to global affairs, the Chairman realised how important it was to keep his nation as a fortress. Protected behind unbreakable walls from the rest of the world. His impact on Georgia has transcended into an almost God-like entity, his legions of devout followers worship him as the saviour and defender of their nation."
kx_geo.155.a:0 "Long live the Chairman!"
kx_geo.156.t:0 "All-Georgian Extraordinary Commission"
kx_geo.156.d:0 "The People’s Guard have served valiantly in their effort to defend the motherland, proud nationalists and socialists who have fought and died for the honour of preserving Georgian soil. However despite this their leader, Valiko Jugheli, has been stirring up trouble. Guardsmen have treated the new Premier with distrust and suspicion, despite Jugashvili’s fate being one of obvious misfortune there are those within the Guard who put the blame on Beria.\n\nTo bring order back to the Guard, Premier Beria has decided a restructuring is best, now under the leadership of loyalist and personal friend to Beria, Sergo Goglidze. The People’s Guard has been renamed to the, All-Georgian Extraordinary Commission, or as it is more commonly known the ‘Cheka’. The tasks of the Cheka are to investigate and root out any political opponents through secret arrests, executions and torture, Chekist officers are also to police and run the rapidly expanding Gulag system that is being built across the nation. As for its former leader, Jugheli, his current whereabouts are unknown and there are rumours of his death but also of self imposed exile..."
kx_geo.156.a:0 "The torch is passed..."
kx_geo.157.t:0 "If you go out into the woods today..."
kx_geo.157.d:0 "The job of the Chairman can be extraordinarily stressful, therefore Jugashvili enjoys spending what free time he has at his multiple dachas. One such includes plentiful land used by Jugashvili and his comrades for hunting game, and this day was meant to be just like any other hunt. Armed with his hunting rifle he set off with his hunting comrades, mostly SEC officials, in search for Caspian red deer.\n\nTrudging through dense woodland, Jugashvili was eager for something to shoot, recent dealings with party officials had left him with a painful headache, he needed to clear his mind before returning to Tiflis. As he looked around he noticed a strange occurrence, his bodyguards who usually surround him at all times were distancing themselves from him whilst his hunting comrades were grouped together some meters away from him. He turned his head to inspect his rifle when the sounds of snapping branches caught him off guard, his party had seemingly vanished leaving him alone surrounded by imposing trees. Then without warning a ferocious roar struck eardrums like bullets, a behemoth of mountain bear came charging towards him. Before he could react the bear had struck him down, its clears ready to slash his feeble body apart. Mustering his remaining strength, Jugashvili cried for help..."
kx_geo.157.a:0 "...his bodyguards then appear firing at the bear wounding it before it could kill him!"
kx_geo.157.b:0 "his bodyguards are too late! The Chairman's corpse lays torn apart..."
kx_geo.158.t:0 "The Chairman Recovers from the Attack"
kx_geo.158.d:0 "Jugashvili’s roars of pain as his face was slashed altered his bodyguards who immediately charged through the woods in search of their Chairman, they spotted him on the ground as the mountain bear towered above him. Unleashing a volley of fire the Bear was struck down, its last whimpers ended with a bullet to the head. The Chairman was immediately rushed to the nearest hospital where he is now under intensive care. Recovering from his wounds the nation were relieved that their dear leader lives to fight another day, however despite the good news there remain some serious questions. Why did his hunting comrades flee before a bear had even been spotted? Why were his bodyguards stationed so far away from the hunting grounds? What was a wandering mountain bear doing on his land? An almost deadly attack from a crazed bear or perhaps something more sinister…."
kx_geo.158.a:0 "Rest well Chairman."
kx_geo.159.t:0 "The Chairman Is Dead!"
kx_geo.159.d:0 "‘The Chairman is dead!’, these were the lines that sent shockwaves throughout the nation. Jugashvili was not only a dear leader of Georgia but he was seen as the national father for every citizen, the defender of the republic. His death was initially suppressed by the SEC, news of his passing was a well guarded secret however it was a secret that could not last long. Jugashvili had passed away from his many wounds suffered during the hunting incident, his bodyguards arriving too late to save his life as the mountain bear charged off hearing a volley of fire. There is much suspicion around the event due Jugashvili’s bodyguards not being present and the time it took for the mortally wounded Chairman to arrive at a hospital, Beria however has confirmed his passing was nothing more than a tragic attack. Whilst delivering his speech at the state funeral, Beria confirmed what was already widely expected, he will succeed the deceased chairman as head of state."
kx_geo.159.a:0 "How could this happen!"
kx_geo.160.t:0 "The New Premier"
kx_geo.160.d:0 "Following the catastrophic hunting accident that has left our dear Chairman deceased, his successor Lavrentiy Beria has been elected by the SEC to assume the position of both head of state and head of government. Adopting the title of ‘Premier’ and adorned in his all black uniform, Beria took to the stage addressing his fellow SEC members. Promising to continue the legacy of Jugashvili through the dedication to Georgian Socialism and achieve the goal of prosperity for every Georgian citizen. However, Beria also stated his intention to introduce economic reforms that could solve the recent slump as well as re-organising the People’s Guard and SEC structure.\n\nFor those wary of Jugashvili’s temper, Beria’s calm and calculated deminier only provides so much relief for it was Beria who organised the purge of the Mensheviks. The fate of Grigol and his comrades could very well await many within the SEC chamber applauding the new Premier. There is also suspicion over the actual fate of the former Chairman, with some doubting the validity of the ‘hunting accident’. Such preposterous rumours will surely be shut down by Beria..."
kx_geo.160.a:0 "Long live Premier Beria!"
kx_geo.161.t:0 "The Night in Tiflis"
kx_geo.161.d:0 "Ever since Lavrentiy took power in Georgia and slowly liberalized the Government to allow some private wealth in the name of 'Progressive Georgian Socialism', he has long since felt the strumming wealth dripping from the pockets of billionaires right to Beria's pockets. Lavrentiy has since then created lavish parties which are unprecedented in scale in the humble nation of Georgia. Despite the enormous size of these parties, the cost to the Government has not been unreasonable, and Beria has tried to maintain a little bit of restraint regarding them. This time, he has created an entire statue made out of ice of himself, commissioned to the best artists in Georgia and used it to make a fruity beverage with crushed ice and fruit juice. Of course, the fruits came from the best sellers in the market across the Caucasus, and only the best friends of Beria were invited. The cause of the party was to 'Celebrate the Party with a party'."
kx_geo.161.a:0 "Let us indulge ourselves for once!"
kx_geo.162.t:0 "Sins of the Premier"
kx_geo.162.d:0 "It appears that Beria has decided that for Georgia to thrive as a nation, it requires profiting - and so, he has done efforts to contact as many people as possible, as many corporations as possible, and as many organizations as possible, to secure as much money as possible for the State of Georgia. This includes the selling of weapons to militant groups in the Russian Tsaritsiyn area, and helping Armenian groups in the Ottoman Empire to rise in resistance in the mountains against the ruling Ottoman Government in favor of creating an expanded Armenian State. Beria has also used the labor of prisoners and political opponents across the world to create a massive slave labour army, used to create grand construction projects for the Georgian people. Not only this, but we've also done efforts in creating trafficking lines of human beings across the Kuban area, everything from children to poor women to the mentally ill are brought in coal trains and forced to do whatever their purchasers wish. Beria in particular has seen human trafficking as one of the best parts of the Georgian economy, wanting to buy a harem of women for himself aswell. This would be risky however, and might result in people finding out and the nescessity of further purges in our society. Beria is at a crossroads - pleasure, or security?"
kx_geo.162.a:0 "For pleasure..."
kx_geo.162.b:0 "For security..."
kx_geo.163.t:0 "The Secret Speech"
kx_geo.163.d:0 "Beria was quick to get to the point - he stood up in a podium in front of hundreds of people, and began his speech with a meek but steady voice:\n\n'Comrades! It is clear to me that you all have suffered for far too long under the Great Terror of Jugashvili and his horrific practices against humanity. He has, for over two years, held all of you in horror and fear, in constant sensation of terrorization and a feeling that you might not live the next day. No longer - For after his hunting accident, I realized I must strike the opportunity and liberate the peoples of Georgia from excess tyranny and lack of reasonable rule, and ensure that we as a Party are united and without fear of sectarianism and splitting. We are united under socialism, and we believe in a bright future for Georgia at costs, but not costs that will destroy our people and tear them apart in sectarian lines. I proclaim: You are free! You are free from his grasp, from his terroristic gaze! The Man of Steel has fallen, and I have risen.'"
kx_geo.163.a:0 "Silence dominates the chamber..."
kx_geo.165.t:0 "Beria Invokes The SEC"
kx_geo.165.d:0 "Our Premier, Lavrentiy Beria, has requested that all SEC members come to an immediate and urgent meeting as soon as possible or face expropriation of their property to the State. It appears that this is serious as Beria has only invoked the entire Party to convene once."
kx_geo.165.a:0 "Well, better meet him then!"
kx_geo.166.t:0 "The Reaction"
kx_geo.166.d:0 "Immediately some loyalists of Jugashvili collapsed, began shouting, or began fighting with others that cheered on. The crowd fell into anarchy as some cried in animalistic rage as they realized that it was over, like an abuser gone after many years of a horrifying relationship, and others had blank reactions, unsure how to exactly feel. The entire Party was shocked, and could not believe what was heard. The majority however somewhat supported Beria, seeing him as a more moderate force that could protect Georgia from further terror, while some loyalists still afraid that this might be a trick (as paranoia was rampant) stated that they would always be loyal to the Party. Most people were in complete horror - and now, Tiflis is filled with newspapers with the full transcription of the Speech, resulting in even more shocked peasants and people all around Georgia that react in either joy or terror. It appears that this might go on for a while..."
kx_geo.166.a:0 "The truth often hurts."
kx_geo.164.t:0 "The Chambers of Knowledge"
kx_geo.164.d:0 "Beria has done extensive efforts regarding the progress of military equipment to compete against other nations. With the newfound wealth gained from opening the Georgian market economy, Beria has created testing chambers to test new chemical weapons, missiles, and other equipment that is considered by the State too confidential to be placing on public testing grounds, so instead they are placed on the Chambers of Knowledge, as they are cryptically called by the Government, placed all around the countryside in Georgia. Of course, to test these new weapons, which range from everything from cyanide caapsules to botulimnium bullets, he has to bring... "willing" subjects to the table. Therefore, the lowest of the lowest in Georgian society are brought to the operating table and tested on, ensuring that nobody but criminals, political enemies, and enemies in other countries during war feel the effects of these new advancements in technology. Beria has personally visited many of these Chambers of Knowledge, recording much of the situations present within them for later study."
kx_geo.164.a:0 "Progress above all."
kx_geo.167.a:0 "Taming the Cossaks..."
kx_geo.167.t:0 "The Chambers of Knowledge"
kx_geo.167.d:0 "After an intense war with the Don Kuban Union, we have successfully captured the capital of Ekaterinodar and pushed the resisting army to the Russian border. Although we are far from implementing rule over the entire nation, we do possess power over the majority of Don-Kuban citizens. Rebels are hidden throughout the mountains and the war will now evolve into guerrilla warfare that will undoubtedly create great pain for us. In the meantime let us celebrate our victory!"
kx_geo.167.a:0 "No force can stop us!"
kx_geo.170.t:0 "Georgia in the Internationale?"
kx_geo.170.d:0 "[GEO.GetNameDEF] has been one of our closest allies in Eastern Europe after their revolution, and they have now sent a request to formally join the Third Internationale. However if we are to accept we will most likely face conflict with Russia."
kx_geo.170.a:0 "Let them in, damn the Russians."
kx_geo.170.b:0 "Georgia is not worth conflict with Russia."
kx_geo.171.t:0 "The French Refuse!"
kx_geo.171.d:0 "After our diplomats were sent to Paris to convince the French to let us join the Third Internationale, it seems that we were denied our request, as such we are now alone in Europe against Russian imperialism and we've been forced down an isolationist path."
kx_geo.171.a:0 "The French will pay for this betrayal!"

POLITICS_NAVAJO_DESC:0 "Formed officially in 1934 and headed by Henry Chee Dodge and taking inspiration from the traditional Naach’id, the Navajo Tribal Council is a loose administrative body that finds its roots in the Navajo Business Council formed in 1922. The Business Council was formed by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and was meant to serve as the liaison between the matriarchal clan society of the Navajo and the American Government. Chiefly created because the Americans sought the valuable mineral wealth hidden beneath our sacred grounds, the Americans quickly showed their true colors as they broke deals and promises once again. When the Hoover Administration failed to pass the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, Chairman of the Business Council Chee Dodge moved to create a new, separate body - the Navajo Tribal Council - in order to serve as an organized and modern political and governmental entity, doing what the Americans failed to do in order to attempt some semblance of modern nationhood to the Navajo Nation. Though the early history of the Council was rocky, failing to be ratified three times by Navajo voters over disagreements in the use of language, the Tribal Council now firmly stands as the legislative, judicial, and executive body of our nation, while the Business Council now only controls the economy. Now growing to include representatives from all constituent tribes - each sending two delegates to each seasonal meeting - and not just the Navajo matriarchal clans, the Council has come to be our own form of native-bred representative government."
POLITICS_CHEE_DESC:0 "Few men are so widely respected in the traditionally matrilineal society of the Navajo as Henry Chee Dodge. Born in 1860 near Fort Defiance to split Navajo and Mexican ancestry, Dodge was only four years old when the Americans forced us on the Long Walk. Becoming separated from his mother, he became an orphan before being taken in by his Navajo aunt and Anglo-American step-uncle. This upbringing kept him rooted in his native ancestry and culture, but also allowed him to easily pick up English, becoming fluent before reaching adulthood. Serving as an translator to the Americans and rising to become the chief Navajo interpreter for the US Army before returning to the Navajo Nation in 1883 to become the police chief of the Navajo Tribal Police. Due to his standing with the Americans and his military background, Dodge was named the ‘Head Chief of the Navajo’ later that that year by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, despite no such title or position existing within Navajo society, coining the Navajo title of Tʼáá Diné Binaatʼáanii. Though this position largely just meant he was the main diplomat to the Americans, Chee continued to serve his people the best he could as the Americans continued to meddle. In 1922, he became leader of the newly created Navajo Business Council, again a move by the Americans and their BIA made to try and steal our land and our mineral wealth, though Chee Dodge was able to finesse the Imperialists in order to make the deals as profitable for the Navajo and other tribes of the Southwest as he could. When the Americans failed to pass meaningful reform for the Amerindians in 1934, Dodge took it upon himself to help his people, and formed the Navajo Tribal Council in order to create a modern functioning government for his people. With the rise of tensions in America and the eventual outbreak of the Second American Civil War and following Mexican Reconquista, Henry Chee Dodge has seized on the chance to bring sovereignty to his long-oppressed kin. Now, as one of the oldest men and most honored elders in the nation, he is set to lead his people towards independence and prosperity once and for all, no matter the direction he must take to get there."
POLITICS_HAYES_DESC:0  "Only born in 1923, Ira Hayes was one of the youngest men to serve in our fight for independence against the Mexicans and Arizonans, and yet he took up the rifle and bow anyway, ready to defend his people and bring sovereignty to the Southwestern tribes without second thought. Akimel O’odham, or Pima, by blood, Hayes hails from the Gila River community in Sacaton, Arizona, born to a volunteer veteran of the Great War and a Sunday school teacher. Raised in both the native traditions of the Pima and in the Presbyterian faith, Hayes was quick to pick up English as a child - a skill that would help propel his career due to being able to understand his eventual foes. Only a teenager when the American Civil War, and eventual Mexican Reconquista, broke out, Hayes was immersed in war from a young age, fighting to defend the Pima lands from wandering scavengers and rogue soldiers during the fighting. After the Mexicans came to dominate these lands, Hayes never dropped his rifle in fear that the Mexicans would try to do what the Americans did, and when our fight for independence began against them, he was ready. Again, only just a boy, he fought and served for his people, showing an aptitude for strategy and combat unlike any other within the Pima nation. By the time the Fourth Navajo War and our revolt against the Arizonans came around, Hayes had already been forged into a hardened soldier. Making a name for himself across the land when he raised his flag high above the Old Governor’s Mansion of Arizona where General Goldwater setup his forward base, Hayes became a hero to all overnight, becoming one of the most famous and respected Indigenous men in the Southwest, and placing him on the direct track to dethrone Chee Dodge’s decades-long dominance within the Navajo Nation. Now leading a union of all Indigenous tribes within the area, Hayes champions compassion, healing, and a drift towards true democracy while also ever-stressing the importance of militarism and ever-readiness against our eternal foes. With a soft heart, iron-hard nerves, an ever-calm demeanor, and skin of steel, Hayes is the perfect fusion of the velvet glove and the iron fist. Let us hope he can bring the paradise he promises."

nvn.1.t:0 "Diné Bahane'"
nvn.1.d:0 "’Diné Bahane', or the Story of the People, is the general name for the Navajo creation myth that began with the Holy Wind and the Four Holy People and the Four Worlds at the Beginning, but it has also become a term used for the story of our new free and independent Navajo Nation - the modern creation myth of our once-again free people. Centuries ago, the Europeans came, and all know the tale of how they brought ruin and ‘modernity’ to this once unsullied continent. They forced the Navajo peoples and many other tribes from the East towards the West, eventually forcing us and others like us onto the reservations that exist all over North America to this day in what the Navajo call the Long Walk. Reaching its pinnacle when the Americans tried to ethnically cleanse and genocide our people in 1864, the Navajo and our related peoples of the Southwest such as the Apache, Hopi, Pima, and many more have been on the slow decline ever since, withering away under American occupation as we have tried to keep one foot in tradition and one on the road to progress and hopeful salvation. In 1922, the Navajo Business Council was created by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in order to serve as the liaison for economic and diplomatic matters between the Navajo Nation and the United States, but in reality it only served to further America’s financial interests as they stole the mineral wealth and water from our grounds in exchange for promised lands and bigger herds that never came. With Chee Dodge heading the council, he only grew to resent the Americans more, and in 1934 when the Hoover Administration tried and failed to pass the Indian Reorganization Act, Chee had finally had enough of their lies. Forming a new Tribal Council dedicated solely to political matters while the Business Council took over the economy, Chee moved to create a functioning state apparatus within the Navajo Nation, doing the job the Americans failed to do. However, as 1936 loomed, the American Civil War and later Mexican Intervention would provide the spark needed to take these nation-building plans even further. \n\nSeeing a shot at freedom once and for all when the Anglos rebelled against their new Mexican occupiers, many of our people followed Chee Dodge’s decision to aid Goldwater in his revolt, for the Tribal Chairman of the Navajo believed that working with Goldwater and winning the Anglo Revolt would finally bring equality, freedom, and relief to our long-suffering people. However, Chee Dodge was sorely wrong. With many of our people split on the decision, our own tribes suffered their own civil conflicts as families and tribes were split between those that fought on the side of the Americans and those that supported the Mexicans. Though the revolt was finally won, the scar it has left on our peoples is clearly visible, and the issues do not stop there. \n\nWith the Arizonans decision to deny us our mineral and water rights, once again breaking treaties and promises as the Americans have been so prone to do, we have been forced into war once again, but now cautiously united aiming at a shot at true independence. Away from the frontlines, Chee Dodge - once running unopposed in recent elections for leading the Navajo Nation and our new unity fire council of the various Southwestern Tribes - has now found a political rival in the young officer Ira Hayes, who has proven himself a sound, humane leader and tactical genius in both our war against the Mexicans and now in our war against the Arizonans. With our nation fighting for survival once again, with the rigors of trying to establish an independent state stacking on the strain, and with political challenges at home, our newly sovereign Navajo Nation teeters on the edge of collapse as we stand at the crossroads of destiny. Let us hope we can find a sound way through to paradise."
nvn.1.a:0 "Be still, and the Earth will speak to you."

nvn.2.t:0 "A New Naach’id"
nvn.2.d:0 "The Naach’id is a rarely-convened council of elders, political and spiritual leaders, and other important members of the main Navajo familial clans, tribes, and bands that is used to discuss and decide upon extremely important matters that affect the whole nation. Once convened every two to four years and staffed by two representatives (called Naalch’id) from each tribal clan, and was headed by an elder of war and an elder of peace that would guide the ceremony. However, it became a council only called to session in times of emergency in modern times, especially since the rise of the Navajo Business and Tribal Councils in 1922 and 1934. Not convened in decades, this new Naach’id is special, for it has included the tribal elders and leaders of our fellow tribes in the Southwestern Unity Pact, including chiefs, chairmen, and presidents from the Ute, the Apache, the Hopi, the Pueblo, the Pima, the Yaqui, the Zuni, and the other local tribes of the Four Corners region, causing quite the controversy among the more traditional members of the Navajo. Even more controversial has been the decision to allow the surviving leaders of the Arizonans also be in attendance, for their fates shall be decided here as well, though they will have no say, and should any even speak, they will be thrown out of the proceedings. The Naach’id has been called mainly to discuss the future of our newly independent Navajo Nation, with this group chiefly desiring to discuss just how ‘Navajo’ the new Nation shall be. Though the Navajo, led by Tribal Chairman and former chief Chee Dodge, dominate this new state in terms of population and political influence, the other half of this coalition, though varied and factionalist, still holds great sway, especially since our war for independence could not have been won without them and their leader Ira Hayes. Though normal elections for the leader of the Navajo Nation usually never require the Naach’id being convened, the extraneous circumstances of this new reality have called for its use, and now the choice is up to this council of esteemed elders on who shall lead our newly free Amerindian nation?"
nvn.2.a:0 "Go with the tribal unity group of war hero Ira Hayes."
nvn.2.b:0 "Side with Navajo interests and Chee Dodge."

nvn.3.t:0 "The Second Order of Business for the Naach’id"
nvn.3.d:0 "With the leadership debate out of the way, the second main topic in discussion within the Naach’id is to be the fate of the Arizonans. Our group has largely been split into three factions over what should be the fate of the Anglos. The dominant opinion is to have the leaders of the revolt, including the infamous ‘Man of Gold and Water’, executed while the bulk of their populace will be allowed to peacefully integrate into our society. This option would leave some resentment in their mouths, but limit their ability to retaliate and offer them a gateway to becoming an equal citizen in our state, which would likely be best over the long term. Alternatively, the two other factions within the Naach’id argue over either pardoning their leaders fully and while working towards integration, which would cause the least amount of unrest among their numbers but also leave their leaders free to spread rhetoric against us, and the drastic alternative. This alternative would see the Anglo leaders hanged and the reservation system revived but reversed, forcing the massive population of Arizonans into large reservations on barren land with powerless autonomy, living as we once did under their regime. The least human option, it would cause unrest but at least ensure the Arizonanas do not have the supplies necessary to rise in violence ever again. What should we do?"
nvn.3.a:0 "Pardon their leaders and work towards peaceful integration."
nvn.3.b:0 "Hang their leaders, and integrate them as peacefully as possible."
nvn.3.c:0 "Reverse the long-standing reservation system, giving them powerless autonomy."


nvn.5.t:0 "Internal Elections Within the Fire Council Coalition"
nvn.5.d:0 "With the parties finally organized and the people ready to finally have their voices heard, the first elections of our new Tribal Union are being held. Though Ira Hayes shall remain as President, these elections will determine who rules alongside him, and what general political plan we will follow going forward. With the progresive Social Democratic unity coalition of Hayes, backed by the Pima, Ute, Yaqui, Zuni, and other Puebloans, and the Capitalist moguls of the Navajo Business Council being the main two parties in the running, many prepare for one of these two groups to win out. However, none should discount the rising tide of the Hopi liberals or the Apache conservatives, for both groups still stand a good chance at victory in this split field. Let the votes be counted!"
nvn.5.a:0 "The progressive unity coalition headed by the Pima, Ute, and Zuni wins out."
nvn.5.b:0 "The Hopi liberals shall guide the state strong and true."
nvn.5.c:0 "Go with the cautious capitalists at the Navajo Business Council."
nvn.5.e:0 "Align with the Apache conservatives and traditionalists."

nvn.8.t:0 "The Extent of Athabascan Unity"
nvn.8.d:0 "The Na-Dené, or Athabascan, ethnolinguistic group describes all related peoples to the Navajo that speak a similar language to our own and have a similar ethnic heritage. This linguistic group is split into three main groups,  being the Southern Na-Dené which includes our people across the Four Corners region as well as neighboring groups such as the Mescalero-Chiricahua speakers to the South and in Texas and the Kiowa-Apache of Oklahoma, the Central Na-Dené of the American Pacific Northwest, and the Northern Na-Dené which stretch from the Dakleh and Nicola of Southern British Columbia all the way up through the Yukon and Alaska. With our decision to attempt to unite the Na-Dené, we must decide how far we are willing to go. Should we only take the Southern Na-Dené of the American Southwest, or should we attempt to unify all the Na-Dené speakers under one banner?"
nvn.8.a:0 "We will not rest until all the Na-Dené are within our borders."
nvn.8.b:0 "We already have enough mouths to feed. Keep our claims on the smaller side."

nvn.9.t:0 "The Extent of Uto-Aztek Unity"
nvn.9.d:0 "The Uto-Aztek language group describes all related peoples to the Pima that speak a similar language and share a similar ethnic background and ancestry. As an ethnolingusitic group, it extends as far south as Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador, and as far North as the lands of the Shoshone in Idaho, also including the lands of the Comanche in Texas and the Tongva and other tribes of Southern California. With our decision to attempt to unite the Uto-Azteka, we must decide how far we are willing to go. Should we only go after the lands of the Uto-Azteka close to use around the American Southwest and in Texas, or should we spread farther North and deep in the South of Mexico and Central America in order to claim the fallen empires of the Aztecs and Maya, uniting all Uto-Aztek speakers under one banner?"
nvn.9.a:0 "We will not rest until all the Uto-Azteka are within our borders."
nvn.9.b:0 "We already have enough mouths to feed. Keep our claims on the smaller side."

nvn.10.t:0 "The Fate of Our Four Corners Project"
nvn.10.d:0 "As we go about uniting the Four Corners regions and the Amerindians that lie within, should we embrace a strictly Navajo identity or should we move to embrace the pan-tribal identity of all within our growing Union?"
nvn.10.a:0 "Proclaim the Tribal Federation of the Southwest."
nvn.10.b:0 "Maintain our Navajo identity."


nvn.12.t:0 "A Capitalist Paradise"
nvn.12.d:0 "Seeking to bring about an economic miracle for our people, Chairman Chee and the Business Council have turned to new methods to breathe life into the economy. By brewing our own tequila, processing local peyote, growing large fields of hemp, marijuana, and tobacco, and by opening up casinos and gambling havens, we will create a Capitalist paradise that cashes in on what the West finds taboo, driving foreign business into our markets. With near total economic power due to his roots in the Business Council through his son, Chee Dodge is free to do as he pleases as he accelerates the economy and Navajo Capitalism into overdrive to make himself, his family, and the People all incredibly wealthy, prosperous, and happy. With changes like these, we will build a golden city here for all to enjoy."
nvn.12.a:0 "All for the good of the people."


nvn.13.t:0 "Traditionalist Revivalism"
nvn.13.d:0 "Displaying levels of populism bordering on Socialism, revering tradition and authoritarian conservatism, and holding a deep love for Capitalism and his people and their culture, the regime of Chief Dodge is strange to say the least. Through syncretic ideas and Paternalism, a unique political and economic system has been created that works for our people and provides all with what they need. As Chief Chee further expands these ideas, he also moves to have his family embrace these ideas as well, for his daughter Annie and son Thomas who aid him in his rule will eventually be his successors in this newly hereditary chiefdom, so that these ideas are enshrined forever. Though his son leans more into paternalism and capitalism while his daughter is more a preacher of populism, cultural revivalism, and tribal unity. Together, they serve to balance Chee’s views, and help him forge this Chiefdom into a perfect paradise for our chosen people."
nvn.13.a:0 "All hail the Chief. All hail the old ways."

nvn.14.t:0 "An Open Society"
nvn.14.d:0 "Seeking to shine light on the forgotten ones, President Hayes’ unity council has gone to great efforts to listen to the needs and wants of the smaller tribes and populations within our state, such as his own tribe the Pima, along with the Puebloans and others. However, he has also moved to incorporate non-Indigenous representatives and opinions as well, for despite our history, they are still part of this new nation, and as such, they must be accounted for. Letting bygones be bygones, an open, unbiased, fair, and free society will be created where all can speak their mind and say their truth without fear of reprisal. Together, we will build our perfect paradise."
nvn.14.a:0 "All will be welcome, no matter the past."

nvn.15.t:0 "A Stratocratic State"
nvn.15.d:0 "The stratocratic regime of Commander and Chief Ira Hayes has only begun to fully take effect, with society militarizing and adjusting to the new ever-ready reality. Mandatory military service with a minimum of 2 years has been made standard for both men and women, and all are trained in multiple disciplines to ensure that we are always ready and that all of our troops can fill holes in the hierarchy or supply line if necessary during times of war. All those that do their service shall be considered full citizens, able to vote and and enjoy the rights and privileges of the state. Those that cannon fight shall simply serve their 2 years aiding the state and the military in other ways. All will learn survival training, and all will know the basic ethnobotany of our people. No man left behind, and no job is too difficult. We will build a state as solid as steel and as strong as titanium, but one that is soft and yielding to its own people and their needs."
nvn.15.a:0 "All for the good of the People."

nvn.16.t:0 "Organization of Democratic Parties"
nvn.16.d:0 "President Hayes, seeking to bring about American-styled multi-party democracy to our nation, has begun to organize new political parties for the people to vote on and support. Though the parties are already being divided along ethnic lines more than political ones, the trends still exist, and four general factions have coalesced. The first and largest group are the Navajo Business Council and their Capitalist allies, seeking to bring moderated Capitalism and privatization to the state. Opposing them as the second largest group is the Social Democratic and Progressive coalition of Ira Hayes, mainly made up of Pima, Zuni, Ute, Yaqui, and the other Puebloans, all united in a push for tribal unity, syncretism, and progressivism. Smaller than these two groups, but still well in the running, are the Hopi liberals who seek a moderate balance between progressive reform, capitalist innovation, and reverence for tradition, and the conservative and hyper-traditionalist clique dominated by the Apache. As each group organizes and begins to campaign, we shall continue to organize the coming elections so that one of these new political bodies can come to dictate the direction and destiny of the state."
nvn.16.a:0 "Now, on to the elections!"


nvn.19.t:0 "A Mini Comancheria"
nvn.19.d:0 "We have taken the lands of Texas, and with it, we now control the plains and badlands, the wild and infamous Comanche ride free. Granting them widespread autonomy within our own borders in exchange for military and economic aid, the Comanche shall carve out their own mini Comancheria within our state as we work together for the benefit of all First Peoples in our union."
nvn.19.a:0 "We will grant autonomy to our old friends and all who follow."

nvn.20.t:0 "Family Ties"
nvn.20.d:0 "Henry Chee Dodge has had many allies and friends help him over his long and storied career, but no associates are closer to him and his own successes like his two children Thomas and Annie. With Thomas leading the Business Council and serving as his father’s right-hand man, and with Annie being the first woman on the Tribal Council and one of the main cultural leaders of the state, Chee Dodge always has backup and a force to lean on when the rigors of rule get to be too much for his aging soul. As he grows older, Thomas and Annie have taken over more and more of his duties, and it likely won’t be long before one of them is officially groomed to be his eventual successor."
nvn.20.a:0 "No allies like family."

nvn.21.t:0 "Formation of the Union Braves"
nvn.21.d:0 "A new special forces group based on the experiences of Ira Hayes and on the training of the United States Army Rangers, the Apache Scouts, and the Tribal Police shall be created in order to meet the needs of the state for an elite fighting force. Trained especially in alpine combat, as paratroopers, and as marines, these new Union Braves will be the cream of the crop and the top of the top in our military, bred to be living war machines and each required to complete the steps required to become a full warchief, such as the counting coup. Behind this elite and small force, we shall never falter, and we will give our enemies hell."
nvn.21.a:0 "Through hell or high water, the Union Braves always get the job done."

nvn.22.t:0 "Frybread!"
nvn.22.d:0 "Fry bread, or frybread, is a traditional food of the Navajo made of a flat dough bread that is fried or deep-fried in oil, shortening, or lard, and prepared with very simple ingredients such as wheat flour, fat, sugar, and salt, though can also be served with toppings like honey, jam, venison, or beef. According to Navajo tradition, frybread was invented in 1864 using the flour, salt, and lard given to them by the American government when the Navajo were forced on the Long Walk to the Arizona reservations, then spread to other tribes. As such, the food has an imperialist history, and is purposefully unhealthy as it was the only food the Americans would spare to the First Peoples. \n\nThis history has caused many traditionalists and anti-American activists within the nation to try and outlaw the public support of frybread, though such a movement has little support due to the widespread love for these delicious snacks. Though most do not wish to see these tasty treats banned, and though we will never forget the painful history that caused them to be invented or needed, the radical anti-Imperialists still wish to see that state publicly denounce their creation and cease serving them at official gatherings. Now we must decide. Shall we eat them not because we are forced to by the Imperialists, but because we want to because they taste good and have become part of our culture and history, or shall we move to publicly denounce this unhealthy product of the dire situations American imperialism pushed us to and purge it from our culture?"
nvn.22.a:0 "A delicious, if unhealthy, snack. Allow the people to eat as they please."
nvn.22.b:0 "A dangerous reminder of Imperialism. Condemn the creation and consumption of frybread!"


nvn.23.t:0 "The Hopi Sages Speak"
nvn.23.d:0 "With the recent testing of our new nuclear device, the nation has been shocked not only by this display of raw power and scientific might, but also by the resistance against such a move coming from the unlikeliest of places. Four Hopi sages, named Dan Evehema, Thomas Banyacya, David Monongye, and Dan Katchongva, came out to speak against our actions. Normally a quiet, private, and reserved people, the Hopi have sent these sages to reveal their secretive ways, wisdoms, and prophecies, allowing our other peoples and peoples around the world to finally learn more about these interesting natives. However, their main prophesy - and their reason for speaking up in the first place - tells of the Blue Star Kachina, or Saquasohuh as the Hopi call it, that will signify the coming of a new age for the world. The ninth and final sign of the Day of Purification, or the final apocalypse of the Earth in a world-engulfing cataclysm, is the appearance of this Saquasohuh, and when it comes, humanity will be at a crossroads between life and death. Seeing these nuclear tests as the coming of the Blue Star, the Hopi urge our government to throw away the secrets of nuclear technology and stray from sharing it with the world, lest we all face the apocalypse."
nvn.23.a:0 "Perhaps we should heed these warnings?"



nvn.25.t:0 "The Flag Flies High"
nvn.25.d:0 "Fighting tooth and nail to end the revolt, Ira Hayes led a detachment of 250 braves just behind enemy lines to secure the Old Governor’s Mansion in Prescott, Arizona. Though not used for political office, it had recently become the forward command center of General Barry Goldwater, leader of the Arizona forces fighting to crush our attempt at independence. Moving on the compound, the fighting was fast, bloody, and fierce, but Ira Hayes and his men moved hard and quickly in order to crush their foes as they hid in their den. Though casualties were high, and though Goldwater was able to slink away and escape, the mansion was taken and the Yankees forced to flee as Hayes and a small squad climbed the roof of the building and raised their flag high while loosing a terrifying warcry to the heavens. Coming back later to take a photo of the scene after this hard fought victory, this moment will always be remembered as the moment our independence was secured. Though Ira Hayes assaulted the mansion with 249 other braves, only 17 survived to make the trip back down, but each and every one of them will forever be remembered as heroes, and Ira Hayes will make sure of that."
nvn.25.a:0 "Among the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes."

nvn.26.t:0 "The Beginnings of Navajo Genetic Medicine"
nvn.26.d:0 "The tribes of the Southwest have unique genetic mutations within their genes that cause them to be more susceptible to certain diseases, particularly among the Navajo and Apache. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, or SCID, is uniquely common among our people, otherwise being an incredibly rare disorder, and has been the cause of numerous deadly and costly outbreaks in the past. Similarly, the Navajo also are more commonly afflicted by the rare mitochondrial mutation called Neurohepatopathology, which can cause severe birth defects and death among newborns like SCID. These genetic disorders have led to our peoples having higher than normal infant mortality rates. As we work to expand our healthcare system and further our understanding of medical science, we shall also work in the fields of biology and genetics in order to find cures to these terrible afflictions, as well as other common afflictions for our people such as diabetes. Though we are likely decades away from a true cure, the work must start somewhere, so let us begin."
nvn.26.a:0 "The odyssey of science and progress never ends."

nvn.27.t:0 "Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park"
nvn.27.d:0 "In order to better preserve the natural and ecological beauty and diversity of our nation, the Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park has been founded on Navajo tribal land near Window Rock, though it is collectively owned by the entire state. Complete with its own gardens, zoo exhibits, and even its own geodesic dome housing a small man-made oasis exhibit, the Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park is sure to be a popular site, though it being built on such sacred ground has annoyed some traditionalists within the state. Even given its own cartoon mascot, an American black bear named Yogi, this new natural reserve is sure to be the hotspot of the region despite pushback from the traditionalists, and we hope that many unique species of flora and fauna come to call this place home."
nvn.27.a:0 "We will showcase the unique biome we call home."


nvn.28.t:0 "Building Up Window Rock"
nvn.28.d:0 "Window Rock, called Tségháhoodzání in the Navajo language, is the capital of our state, and named after the unique rock arch located on the site. Newly created in 1936 from the few sparse settlements and ranches in the area, Window Rock is a brand new city; just barely older than our infantile nation itself. As such, we have much work to do in order to make this a fully functional and outfitted national capital, so we must get to work on building the first true planned city in indigenous America. All that is left to decide is how the city should be designed. Should we favor a more Navajo-oriented design with their architecture and culture in mind, given that the city is on their land and was first founded by them, or should we move in a more inclusive direction, incorporating designs, ideas, needs, and cultural notes of all the tribes in our union?"
nvn.28.a:0 "We will favor the Navajo here at Tségháhoodzání."
nvn.28.b:0 "All tribes have a place at Window Rock."

nvn.29.t:0 "Linguistic Revivalism"
nvn.29.d:0 "In order to better distinguish our current reality from our Imperialist past while also seeking to preserve our unique cultures, a program of language revivalism shall be pursued. All indigenous languages within our borders from the Apache and Navajo to the Ute and Zuni will be revived and taught to the masses, slowly becoming the dominant languages used by our government and state. Though English and Spanish will always be around, we will rely on them less and less as we seek to undo the linguistic and cultural damage done to the People."
nvn.29.a:0 "Turning back the clock on our nearly-extinct languages."

nvn.30.t:0 "Archeological Preservation"
nvn.30.d:0 "The American Southwest is host to a large number of sacred sites, archaeological hotspots, and other points of cultural significance and historical relevance that deserve to be preserved and protected. Archaeological sites like the relic Puebloan Dwellings spread throughout Four Corners, Chaco Canyon, the Taos Pueblo, the Acoma Pueblo, Casa Grande shall all be preserved and studied, for these buildings go as far back as 750 AD, and are the oldest still-surviving buildings in all of North America; incredibly well-preserved by the blasting sands of the desert and time. They are our links to our past and the past of all human life in the New World, so let us embrace this legacy."
nvn.30.a:0 "The true first children of the Southwest revealed."

nvn.31.t:0 "The Raids of the Bilagáana"
nvn.31.d:0 "Local towns, settlements, and ranches on the outskirts of our borders have been besieged by marauding bands of Bilagáana - White Devils - rampaging against our new state, with the surviving Arizona Rangers being a particular thorn in our side. To combat these roughriders, a new division within the Tribal Police shall be made, specially trained and specifically equipped to hunt down and execute these terrorists. No berzerk Bilagáana will come to ruin our paradise, even if these once-proud veterans of Arizona’s failed military must all be jailed or put down like dogs."
nvn.31.a:0 "A dirty and hard job, but one that must be done."

nvn.32.t:0 "A Local Hero"
nvn.32.d:0 "Many heroes and martyrs were made during our wars for independence, for the crucible of war is where true legends are forged. One such hero of our revolt is the young Hashkasilt Begay, also known as Peter MacDonald. Serving under Ira Hayes during the war, MacDonald and Hayes grew close as Hayes took him under his wing, with MacDonald even being in the squad that helped Hayes raise their flag above the Arizonans. Following the war, he finished his education as an engineer and began working for a local airforce company that sourced planes from the Hughes Aircraft Company. Notably a fan of the politics of Barry Goldwater, MacDonald has long delved into Libertarian and Capitalist ventures of dubious moral standing, and has fallen into controversies following his service over allegations of corruption, bribery, and fraud when not tinkering with planes, and was even involved in a minor land dispute with a Hopi member of our union. Regardless of his service, MacDonald is proof that not all veterans are perfect heroes."
nvn.32.a:0 "Perhaps not all heroes are perfect."

nvn.33.t:0 "A Win for Our Foremothers" 
nvn.33.d:0 "In a move that has been seen as indicative of a new age for our nation, activist Annie Dodge - daughter of Chee Dodge - and Lilakai Julian Neil have been elected by the people as the first two women ever to serve in the Tribal Council. Though Navajo society has long been matriarchal, the Council was originally created as a tool for the Americans and their Bureau of Indian Affairs, and as such, no women have ever served in its ranks before. A major victory for women all through our nation, let us hope these intelligent females can help [root.getleader] guide our nation towards a better tomorrow."
nvn.33.a:0 "The First Woman, White Shell Woman and Changing Woman would all be proud."

nvn.34.t:0 "Cross-Tribal Training"
nvn.34.d:0 "The Navajo Nation Police Department and the Oglala Lakota Police Department in South Dakota are the two largest indigenous police forces in North America. Though our Oglala friends do not have their independence, that will not stop us from training with their officers in order to benefit both of our forces. We shall show them the tricks we have learned fighting the Arizonans, Mexicans, and Americans, and they shall teach us all their special strategies in turn, especially their aptitude for the ways of horseback combat. Together, we will both learn to better protect and serve our peoples."
nvn.34.a:0 "For the good of all First Peoples."


nvn.35.t:0 "Incessant Bickering"
nvn.35.d:0 "Two matrilineal clans of the Navajo have recently gotten into a dispute over land rights to a local cattle ranch, and it is up to [root.getleader] to resolve the issue. One clan claims that the land should belong to her own family because her grandmother once worked these pastures decades ago, while the other clan claims that their great-great grandmother worked these plains, so they are entitled to the ranch instead. Such a delicate decision is commonplace in the daily duties of our national leader, but such things must be handled to keep the state running and our traditions intact."
nvn.35.a:0 "Award the ranch to the clan with the stronger claim."
nvn.35.b:0 "Award the ranch to the clan with the older claim."

nvn.36.t:0 "Ethnobotany"
nvn.36.d:0 "The peoples of the Southwest, particularly the Navajo and the Zuni, have long used local plants to create medicine and other useful products for the People. From Viola nephrophylla used by the Ramah Navajo in rituals and medicine to cause rapid vomiting to Carex seeds which are ground into a common snack, the plants of the Southwest can be incredibly useful. There is Abronia fragrans, used medicinally for boils and taken internally if one swallows poisonous insects or spiders, or as a cathartic, for insect bites, as a sudorific, as an emetic, for stomach cramps, and as a general panacea. The Ramah Navajo even use it as a lotion for sores or sore mouths and to bathe perspiring feet. There's Rocky Mountain Maple, frequently ground into a mash and used as a general cure-all and swelling reducer. New Mexican giant hyssop can be used to repel deer from crops and to keep witches away, or to reduce fever, sores, coughs, and cankers if ingested, and is also made into a lotion for chanting rituals. Southern Maidenhair ferns can help ease insect stings while Western Yarrow can help with saddle sores, be made into a general health tonic, help with headaches, and reduce sores from wearing ceremonial masks. \n\nAgave can be drunk as a water substitute, made into alcohol, baked and eaten, and used in rope making or in baking pits as fuel or flavoring. Artemisia tridentata can stop chafing and swelling, ease snakebites if applied to wounds quickly enough, and be used as a laxative or a diaphoretic, while Brownfoot can be used to ease labor pains and postpartum depression. Pinus flexilis makes good wood for bows while Fendlera rupicola’s bark can kill lice and its wood makes amazing arrow shafts and ceremonial plumes, while Prunus americana makes the best red dyes. Lycium pallidum can even be used to soothe chicken pox, Juniperus communis can help with diabetes, and Sticky Snakeweed is good for healing the sores and wounds of our horses. Though many alternative healing methods are bunk, we truly know the ways of natural healing, and our people benefit from it."
nvn.36.a:0 "Nature’s gifts to those who know how to find them."

nvn.37.t:0 "The Native American Church Takes Root"
nvn.37.d:0 "With our independence secured and with the state now largely stabilizing, missionaries from the Native American Church located in Oklahoma have come to set up a branch of their religion here in our union. Famous for their use of tobacco and peyote in their religious ceremonies, the Native American Church has been allowed to enter the state and set up shop, though they will get no special attention from the government. They shall be free, as all indeigenous religions are, to be practiced and preached within our borders so long as they do not force their views on any others. Who knows, maybe hallucinogens will do some of our people some good."
nvn.37.a:0 "Yet another facet of Indigenous culture to embrace."

nvn.38.t:0 "Celebrating Our Unique Cultural Practices"
nvn.38.d:0 "Revolving around the myth of the Changing Woman, a Navajo goddess and deity of maturation and growth, the Kinaalda is a coming of age ceremony all Navajo woman go through. Occurring after their first menstrual cycle and lasting four days, the ceremony once mainly held significance as signaling when a Navajo woman was ready to bear children and be a full woman in the matriarchal society. However, with our modernizing pushes, the ceremony has come to be more about women empowerment and the fostering of kinship and support between women in the tribe. \n\nAnother cultural quirk of the Navajo making a resurgence are the song ceremonial complexes - a group of spiritual practices used to maintain balance and harmony in the lives of the practitioner and those who they channel it upon. Taking the form of beautiful and haunting chants, the Changways and Blessingway are just some of the complexes, and some are frequently paired with the Kinaalda to center the spirits of the women as they enter adulthood. Unique cultural practices like these and more shall be revived and protected as we strive for modernity, and tweaked to fit contemporary realities and sensibilities as we go along."
nvn.38.a:0 "Let our sounds soothe the troubles of maturation."

nvn.39.t:0 "A Change in Lexicon"
nvn.39.d:0 "The word Navajo is a term coined by our former Spanish oppressors, coming from their name for us, the ‘Apaches de Navajó’ or Apaches from Navajo. With Athabascia and the lands of the Na-Dené under our control and with the Imperialist identity of this land being finally purged, Chee Dodge has moved to ban the word Navajo as a slur. We shall forever only be known by our own word for our people, the Diné, or Na-Dené when referring to our specific ethnolinguistic family. Furthermore, the White identity of all shall be eroded or made second-class as Amerindian culture and Diné traditions become dominant in this new paradise. We will undo the damage wrought on our people without stooping to their genocidal and destructive ways."
nvn.39.a:0 "Call us Diné, or call us nothing at all."

nvn.40.t:0 "The Uto-Aztek Unity Council"
nvn.40.d:0 "With the lands of the Uto-Aztek ethnolinguistic group being consolidated and integrated into the wider fabric of the state, Ira Hayes has gone ahead with his plan to expand the Tribal Council. Creating the Uto-Aztek Unity Council, this new legislative, executive, and judicial body will include members from every single constituent tribe within the nation, and will even include a small group of non-Indigneous members to ensure that their voice is heard as well. Headed by Ira Hayes and his appointed cabinet that serve as the highest judges, legislators, and executives on the council, this new governmental structure will assuredly bring true representative democracy to the people, allowing us to address their needs and wants as they arise, fairly and without bias."
nvn.40.a:0 "Together towards a brighter future."

nvn.41.t:0 "Miss Navajo Nation"
nvn.41.d:0 "Seeking to create a platform to spread ideas of feminism, woman empowermant, and cultural preservation, the Navajo within our union have moved to create the Miss Navajo Nation pageant. Despite its name, it is open to women of all tribal backgrounds within our union, and unlike American or European pageants, the competition is about ‘heads and hands’ over bodily beauty. Contestants are required to perform and compete in numerous traditional practices from fry bread making, spiritual healing, and blanket weaving to sheep shearing, horse rearing, and cattle butchering. The winner of each year’s competition will serve as the ambassador and representative for women in the nation at any and all official meetings of the government, and will also work with a foundation to expand women’s rights in the nation. \n\nThe mission statement reads as follows: ‘In keeping with Navajo culture and tradition, the role of Miss Navajo Nation is to exemplify the essence and characters of First Woman, White Shell Woman and Changing Woman and to display leadership as the Goodwill Ambassador. Miss Navajo Nation represents womanhood and fulfills the role of 'grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister' to the Navajo people; therefore she can speak as a leader, teacher, counselor, advisor and friend. It shall be the mission of the Office of Miss Navajo Nation to encourage every Navajo to assist in the preservation of Navajo culture and Miss Navajo Nation will represent the importance of Navajo women with respect and honor.’"
nvn.41.a:0 "May these women be an inspiration to little girls across the nation."

nvn.42.t:0 "Reviving the Ghost Dance"
nvn.42.d:0 "Beginning among the Paiute by Elder Wodziwob and Wovoka in 1889 and 1890 after they received numerous visions from the ancestors, the Ghost Dance is a syncretic cultural and spiritual movement that combined ideas and traditions from numerous tribes in order to spiritually heal the people as well as to encourage pan-tribal unity and resistance against the Americans. Popular with the Lakota, the Paiute, and the tribes of California and Oklahoma as well as the states in between, the Ghost Dance Movement led to an increase in anti-American rhetoric and resistance action that culminated in acts like the Wounded Knee Massacre and the Ghost Dance War. Seeking to revive this syncretic movement due to its ideas of pan-Native Americanism aligning with our current goals and actions, the Ghost Dance religion shall be revived and supported by the state, though we will not go so far as to declare it a state religion. It shall merely be one of the many native religions and spiritual philosophies supported by the state for matters of cultural growth and preservation. "
nvn.42.a:0 "The white man says that the 1890 massacre was the end of the wars with the Indian, the end of the Ghost Dance. Yet here we are at war, we're still Indians, and we're Ghost Dancing again."

nvn.43.t:0 "Expanding Turquoise Mining"
nvn.43.d:0 "Turquoise mining and usage has long been a common craftform for the Navajo and Pueblo peoples, with jewelry both for spiritual usage and decoration being commonplace. However, turquoise is perhaps even more loved by outsiders, who frequently go nuts over the blue-green stone’s beauty and the idea of purchasing native-made goods. In order to capitalize on this fad, we have moved to expand turquoise mining and the production of turquoise goods shall increase to meet the demand of our foreign buyers."
nvn.43.a:0 "This will surely sell well with the eclectic and quirky types."

nvn.44.t:0 "The Renaming of Squaw Tits"
nvn.44.d:0 "The Squaw Tits is a 12,000 foot tall summit in Maricopa County, Arizona that was named in reference to its shape. Looking like a pair of breasts poking out from the arid desert around it, Squaw Tits may be a humorous name, but also carries the derogatory slur used against Indigneous women by our former oppressors. We shall move to rename the mountain Isanaklesh Peaks after the Apache goddess, and hold a special Isanaklesh Gotal, or ceremonial singing dedicated to the goddess, in order to consecrate the peak as a new holy site, wiping away the imperialist taint from the land once and for all."
nvn.44.a:0 "Praise be to the Mother Isanaklesh."

nvn.45.t:0 "A Proposition on the Tlingit"
nvn.45.d:0 "To the North, the Tlingit - our fellow Na-Dené and tribe famed for their totem poles, basket weaving, beautiful Chilkat robes and their skill at hunting the beasts of the Pacific Northwest seas - have earned their freedom. Should we welcome these linguistic brothers into our growing union, or shall we leave them to their own fate."
nvn.45.a:0 "Welcome these fellow Na-Dené to our union."
nvn.45.b:0 "We do not need more mouths to feed in far off lands."

nvn.46.t:0 "Going Beyond the Realm of the Na-Dené"
nvn.46.d:0 "We have pushed out to the boundaries of North America, conquering all the lands of the Dene-speaking people. Our main ethno-linguistic group has been united, but some still call for more. The Athabascan-Eyak-Tlingit, or Na-Dené, language group is only one half of a fractured whole, for across the Bering Sea and far off into the heart of Russia lies our long-lost ethnic kin. The peoples of the Yeniseian River in central Siberia speak a language similar to our own and share many physiological features that we do, leading some anthropologists and linguists to believe they are our distant kin. At our current size and power, taking on one of the world superpowers would be a challenge, but an achievable one. Should we attempt to liberate our long lost ancestral cousins in Siberia, or begin to turn inwards and focus on building our paradise?"
nvn.46.a:0 "Onwards to Dené–Yeniseia!"
nvn.46.b:0 "We have no desire to throw the lives of our men away in the cold wastes of Siberia."

nvn.47.t:0 "Dené–Yeniseia is Secured!"
nvn.47.d:0 "We have taken the lands of the Yeniseians and united our long-fractured ethnolinguistic group. Now, should we proclaim a new state to match our new identity, or should we stay true to the identity that carried us since our independence?"
nvn.47.a:0 "Proclaim the state of Dené–Yeniseia!"
nvn.47.b:0 "We shall stick with the Athabascan identity of the Na-Dené."
nvn.47.c:0 "Go farther with the ethnolinguistic theory and proclaim Dené–Caucasia!"

nvn.48.t:0 "The Shoshone Enter the Fold"
nvn.48.d:0 "The Shoshone of Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, California, and Utah, along with their neighboring tribes, have begun to be integrated into our Uto-Aztek union. Famous to the world for Sacajawea, the native guide on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the tribe is chiefly split into two groups. One half that adopted the horse and buffalo culture of the Plains Indians once the Europeans introduced horses to America, and another half that stayed behind and stuck to their old ways in the forests of their native home. Their numbers have been admitted into our union as full citizens, and both aspects of their culture shall be embraced by the state, with our military in particular interested in their expertise at tracking, horseback riding, and mountain survival skills. They are sure to make a fine addition to the union."
nvn.48.a:0 "Sutummu Tukummuinna."

nvn.49.t:0 "Strange Theories on Our Origins"
nvn.49.d:0 "There exists a strange, outlandish theory among some scholars, racial theorists, pseudoscientists, and conspiracy theorists that has begun to take hold in the dark recesses of our state. It states that the first inhabitants of Meso-America do not come from the Sibero-Mongolic peoples from the Beringian land bridge that North and South Amerindians largely descend from, but instead are the descendants of a separate lineage of New World colonizers. They suggest that the Meso-Americans, including the Maya, Aztec, Pima, and the rest of Meso-America along with the entire Uto-Aztek language group, all descend from White-skinned colonizers hailing from North Africa and Iberia during the time of Carthage. Though ridiculously bizarre and insanely improbable, that has not stopped some from subscribing to the idea. The theory regrettably gained international attention when German Rosicrucian and occultist physician Arnold Krumm-Heller, hiding out in Mexico, openly praised the idea, writing about it at length and even getting his friend and ally Nicolás Carrasco to become interested in the idea. No matter what others say, we know this to be absolute nonsense, and borderline offensive. We should probably forget these theories at once."
nvn.49.a:0 "Absolutely preposterous, unless..."

nvn.50.t:0 "Second Thoughts on Strange Theories"
nvn.50.d:0 "Despite our best intentions and efforts, the strange theories on our racial origins have begun to surface again. The supporters of these theories, some of whom are even within our government, call for the invasion of this so-called ‘homeland’ in what once was Carthage, seeking our empire to stretch to Iberia and North Africa.

Our stratocratic populist state is ever ready to defend our infantile pan-tribal union no matter the cost, and Hayes rules with a velvet glove dipped in iron, providing the firm but gentle and pliable guiding hand needed to build an independent, sovereign, and self-sufficient union. Mandatory military service and the wider militarization of society may have brought us some growing pains, but the protected paradise it has allowed to form is well worth the price of losing a few simple liberties, and Hayes’ health and education reforms have only brought greater standards of living to the masses. Under Commander and Chief Hayes, we shall only know new glories, victories, and progress.

Under the direction of the Tribal Council and the Business Council, Chairman Chee Dodge has brought about a true economic miracle here in Dinétah.

Only one of the populations of the Yaqui in the United States - the Pascua Yaqui of Tucson, Arizona - were accepted by the failed Federal government, with the Americans ignoring the Yaqui of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Nebraska, and the southern range of Arizona. Furthermore, the Yaqui live largely across Northern Mexico, such as in Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, and Jalisco, with a splinter population living in Yucatan. During the Mexican Revolution, the Yaqui tried to fight for better rights and higher standards of living, coming under fire from multiple sides in that terrible conflict. With the Yaqui finally free, we shall move to repair the damage the Mexicans did on them during their Revolution, uplift and modernize their reservations long neglected by the Americans, and set the standard of how we treat all new tribes and First Peoples who come under our banner as we march further South, such as our Uto-Aztek brethren like the Cora, the Huichol, the Nahuas, the Numic, the Hopi and more, along with all the other indiegnous peoples of Meso-America.

However, with his death, a successor must be chosen, and it is here that the new debate has arisen. The government is divided over whether to follow matrilineal lines of our old traditions, nominating Chee Dodge’s daughter Annie Dodge Wauneka as the new Chief, or if we should follow this new patrilineal lifestyle imposed upon us by the American oppressors, instead moving to nominate Chee’s son Thomas Dodge. Both choices have their merits, but most traditionalists and anti-Americanists favor Annie while most modernists and Americanists favor Thomas. Who shall we choose?"

Now, all we have to decide is who shall lead us. The main face of the group is Henry Chee Dodge, first chief of the Navajo thanks to the meddling of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and wise councilman who united our peoples against American pressure and exploitation of our mineral, farming, ranching, and water rights. However, Chee Dodge has grown old, and so it is up to his children Annie and Thomas Dodge to lead the way in his stead. Most traditionalists and anti-Americanists within our nation support Annie’s bid for the seat in looming elections, citing our matrilineal traditions supported by Annie’s right-hand woman Lilakai Julian Neil - the first woman ever to be elected into the Navajo Tribal Council. However, most modernists and those who bend to a fusion of Navajo-Americanist idealism support Thomas Dodge, shying away from matrilineal tradition in order to create a more ‘Western’ Navajo Nation.

Chato is a Chiricahua Apache subchief and skilled raider who has led our nascent military to great effect since our fight for independence, gaining veterancy during his time leading raids against the Arizonan settlers in the late 1800s, and has rallied much of the young guard to his side despite his advanced age. Naiche, on the other hand, is one of the last hereditary Chiricahua Apache chiefs, and has become famous across the nation for his diplomatic skill and experience as a leading statesman and executive, rallying much of the old guard around his skill.

With the progressive Social Democratic unity coalition of Hayes, backed by the Pima, Ute, Zuni, and other Puebloans, and the Capitalist moguls of the Navajo Business Council being the main two parties in the running, many prepare for one of these two groups to win out. However, none should discount the rising tide of the Hopi liberals or the Apache conservatives, for both groups still stand a good chance at victory in this split field, and with our recent acquisition of Texas, the local unionist and Comanche-Mexican socialist Emma Tenayucca seeks to bring native-minded Leftism to the Southwest Indians.

However, the worst has been avoided by Councilwoman and President Emma Tenayuca. A Mexican-Comanche unionist, Socialist activist, egalitarian progressive with a soft spot for agrarian interests and the rural peasants and farmers while focused on labor and societal equality and reform, Tenayuca has worked hard to make life equal, fair, and prosperous for all within our borders - even the divisive White population. However, she has begun to be influenced by new movements from Texas and Mexico that have latched onto our united Uto-Aztek identity. \n\nThe first movement comes from Texas and the work of the American singer turned politician Woody Guthrie and his allies in the Mexican-American unionist coalition called the PLM-IWW, namely Rosendro Doramo of Opata indian blood, Fernando Palomares of Mayo indian blood, and the young upcomer to the famers’ rights scene Cesario Estrada Chavez. Pushing ideas of rural agrarianism and frontier-focused Socialism based on the old vaqueros called Cowboy Communalism, this form of Libertarian Leftism with a Wild West facade would be a perfect unifying force among our Mexican-American and Indigenous populations while also harkening to Tenayuca’s own childhood on a ranch and her family’s twin history in Mexican-American and Comanche ranching. Rivaling this idyllic imagining of frontier utopia however is the other more Indigenous-specific ideology tugging at Tenayuca’s interest. \n\nFounded by the likes of Frida Kahlo, Gerardo ‘Dr. Atl’ Murillo Cornado, and Diego Rivera, this so-called ‘Mexicayotl’ movement seeks to unite Mesoamerican indigenous cultures with modern ideas of Socialism, Anarcho-Syndicalism, and aesthetic patriotism to form an Aztek-influenced democratic socialist republic in Mexico. With the main pillars of this Mexicayotl movement already resonating with many of Tenayuca’s policies and ideas while also meshing well with our new Uto-Aztek/Comanche syncretic identity, perhaps we could incorporate more of their ideas into the fold for the betterment of all Southwestern tribes. However, only one ideological influence can win out, so where shall Tenayuca steer our tribal union?"

In order to remedy this issue while lessening our dependence on European languages like English and Spanish, we have moved to revitalize and repopularize Hand Talk. Also known as Plains Indian Sign Language or PISL by Alfred Kroeber and Charles F. Voegelin - the two American anthropologists that largely brought PISL to light in the Western mindset, Hand Talk is a centuries-old sign language native to the Americas created and spread by the various Indian tribes of the Great Plains and the and its bordering regions such as our own slice of the Southwest long before European contact, with its maximum range extending throughout all of the continental United States that lie west of the Mississippi, up into central and eastern Canada, and down a bit into northern Mexico. Functioning as a lingua franca of sorts for the various Indian tribes spread across the heartland of North America, Hand Talk has been used in inter-tribal diplomacy, trade, story-telling, oratory, ceremonies and by deaf people, while serving as a distinct cultural marker and achievement derived from our pre-contact ancestors and a way for our peoples to remain connected afterwards. \n\nOne of the sign languages that was merged to form American Sign Language, though distinct from the unrelated Navajo Family Sign - another sign language used within our confederation by deaf members of the Navajo tribe - and other similar indigenous sign languages like the ones used in Texas and Mexico before the arrival of the Spanish, Hand Talk is an interesting language with a long history, but it has become increasingly rare thanks to population fragmentation, cultural degradation, and other societal illnesses caused by the American genocide against our peoples and the ensuing occupation, now largely only being known by elders, political leaders, and those few who travel frequently between the reservations. We shall remedy this decline and repopularize Hand Talk’s usage across our state and beyond, allowing us to communicate with our fellow Amerindians without always having to resort to foreign tongues."

These clans shall hold the political power and influence they always have, but now in a modern and officialized framework backed by law."

NVN_foremothers_desc:0 "Many tribes of the Southwest, chiefly the Navajo, are matrilineal and matriarchal in nature, and although men frequently hold positions of political influence and power, none are more respected and few have their word taken as seriously as the words of our clanmothers. We shall never forget this legacy, and move to build a society that treats all sexes and identities as equal akin to what many Westerners would call ‘feminism’. Though our generals, warriors, chiefs, and chairmen may often be men, our mothers and grandmothers shall always have the most final and most respected say."

NVN_humiltaion:0 "Defiant in the Face of Humiliation"
NVN_humiltaion_desc:0 "The Great Humiliation has slowly been undone, and our people now stand strong, proud and unburdened from the shackles that once bound us. Our new state blossoms and blooms in this arid oasis, and our peoples breathe free air once again. We are prosperous in this new homeland, and we have remained defiant of the destiny once forced upon us, carving our own path towards newfound paradise. Now, with the state consolidated and organized, and with the People and the nation slowly healing, we can begin to focus on desires and dreams beyond our own lands."

NVN_tribalism:0 "Pursue Southwest Tribal Regionalism"
NVN_tribalism_desc:0 "Eschewing insane ideas of linguistic unity based upon flimsy justifications, we shall go forward with the sound and tame plan of uniting the Four Corners region of the American Southwest, securing this arid oasis as a paradise for our chosen people. With a policy of Southwestern tribal unity and regionalism paired with isolationism, we shall expand to our rightful borders then look inwards, turning our backs on the world as we work to build our own utopia here in the lands of painted sand and scorched scrub."

Once declared chief by the Americans despite the matrilineal Navajo having no concept of the position, then chairman of the Business Council, and now Tribal Chairmen of the Tribal Council, Chee Dodge stands as the most powerful and most respected man in our infantile state. May his sharp business sense and traditionalist, paternalistic demeanor guide our unified and free peoples to prosperity on this odyssey towards our new destiny."

NVN_chee_council_desc:0 "Choosing to remain within the confines of his executive position as Head Chairman of the Navajo Tribal Council, Henry Chee Dodge shall endeavor to bring Indigenous capitalism and profitable prosperity to our sovereign nation without overstretching his powers. Though he shall likely continue to smooth talk and strongarm the rest of the Tribal Council to go along with his decisions and whims of Capitalism reforms, economic liberalization, and the strengthening of traditional Navajo identity and practices, the facade of Tribal republicanism shall be maintained, for this is simply the best decision for the People."

NVN_chee_cheifdom:0 "Return of the Chiefdom"
NVN_chee_cheifdom_desc:0 "Ignoring the alien nature of the idea to our people, Henry Chee Dodge has decided to embrace the American-given title of ‘Chief’ of the Navajo despite our matrilineal nature. Though this title was fabricated by the defunct Bureau of Indian Affairs, Chee has found it fitting of our new reality, and shall move to create a hereditary chiefdom under himself and his family, particularly his children Thomas and Annie Dodge, along with his highly respected wives. Embracing still-developing ideas of Navajo nationalism and American-influenced protectionist Capitalism married with a staunch reverence for Navajo traditions, we will build the first true Chiefdom of the Southwest form-fit for the Navajo people."

Though we are home to many other peoples such as our allies the Apache and the Hopi, or the ignorant Arizonans still within our borders, we must always focus on our own people first. All shall be cared for and all shall be true citizens, but the Navajo and our culture and traditions shall always come first, and Chee Dodge shall ensure this always is our reality."

The Chief shall ensure that none will want, and none will need to beg or scrape by for what they need. All will be ensured a sound, peaceful, and fulfilled life with guaranteed food, water, housing, and healthcare under the benevolent rule of the new hereditary chiefdom, and all will know that it was Chief Chee Dodge that brought this relief to them."

NVN_business_council_desc:0 "Once the leading figure of the Business Council before his ascension to Tribal Councilman and eventual Chairman, Henry Chee Dodge has long held close links with the economic and financial heart of the Navajo Nation. By placing his son Thomas within the Business Council as its Chairman, and by greatly expanding its powers and reach, we will build a stronger, freer economy built on the back of Capitalist theory and political domination. With Chee Dodge in command of both the Tribal Council himself and the Business Council through his son, he will be largely free to do as he pleases as he endeavors to bring about an economic miracle here in Dinétah."

Mister Interpreter and master negotiator, Henry Chee Dodge is the final and supreme voice of the Navajo Nation. Through wise decrees and traditional action tied to modern ideas, Chee has been able to craft a prosperous paradise for his people. Undoing the horrors of the Long Walk and beyond, the People have begun to truly heal and prosper. Let us sing praise to the Foremothers and to Chee Dodge, for we are finally on the road to paradise under his absolute word."

The main Na-Dené groups, being the Southern Athabaskans of which we are a part of, the Pacific Coast Na-Dené of Northern California, Washington and Oregon, the Northern Na-Dené of Western and Northern Canada and Alaska, along with the related Tlingit and Eyak ethnolinguistic groups, all could potentially be brought into the fold, if we are ready for war once again.

Coming from the land of the Pima Indian, and after battling up the Arizona hills, this war hero of our fight against both the Mexicans and the Arizonans has been chosen in the Naach’id as the leader of this new Southwestern Tribal Union, moving past the previous solely-Navajo identity of the Navajo Nation to become a confederation of Indigenous peoples that inhabit this beautiful oasis amid the arid deserts and badlands of America. Though his election is unprecedented in the history of any of our peoples, it has been decided that union of tribes and identities is the best way forward for the People, so let us embrace unity to bring prosperity once and for all!"

Council members will now be elected on a regular basis instead of serving, with term-lengths of 4 years and with term limits being a topic of future debate. Furthermore, inter-council parties will be allowed to organize and campaign to the people, creating a functioning representative democracy open to all peoples within our union. Under Ira Hayes, the Council shall transition from being a cold and detached entity barely recognized by the masses due to it once serving as an American tool to being a true democratic legislative, judicial, and executive body accepted and used by the People as a whole."

Though technically a junta, democracy still shall reign as officers and councilmen are elected by the troops and police officers within the nation, and with mandatory, though temporary, military or police service rising to become standard, effectively all citizens will get a say in government at least once in their lives. Under this stratocratic system, order and prosperity shall be brought to our tribal union by a velvet glove wrapped in iron and steel."

From the Hopi and Apache to the Pima and Zuni, including our friends the Puebloans, the Yaqui, and the Ute, and never forgetting the Navajo or any other tribe that is within our union now or comes to be within our union in the future, all tribes and all indigenous peoples of the Americas shall always be seen as distinct equals. We will never muddy the individual identities of our constituent tribes, but all shall be seen as equal before the state and before the law, all shall be voting citizens with full and protected rights, and all shall be equally represented with no favoritism given to any one specific culture or identity. Together, we will build a new syncretic identity without losing touch with each one of our individual and distinct roots."

Emulating this bravery and militarist aptitude, the new Tribal Union shall militarize like never before, slowly becoming an army with a state. Mandatory service will be extended, benefits and pensions for service members shall be increased, and the military-industrial complex shall grow larger and more efficient as it becomes more closely linked to the Tribal Council under Commander and Chief Ira Hayes. Military excellence and perpetual readiness will be stressed as the state begins to put more and more funding towards our military and towards our industrial build-up. We will prepare for the inevitable day our enemies come knocking, or the day we decide to go knocking first."

NVN_hayes_republic:0 "Americanized Plural Republicanism"
NVN_hayes_republic_desc:0 "Taking our steps at humanizing the Council and bringing egalitarian humanism to all indigenous peoples in our union even further, President Ira Hayes has moved to organize full multi-party democracy within the Tribal Council. Expanding the number of councilmen greatly and setting it to grow with the steadily rising population, new parties shall be organized and act as special interest groups that represent the will of the people. Though it is likely these parties will be dominated by one tribe or another, and though Ira Hayes shall still rule as President regardless of which parties are elected to the Council, it is a great step on the road to true American-style Republican Democracy form-fit for the realities of the People."

From alcoholism and drug abuse to crime and an unchecked mental health crisis, the social, societal, and mental ailments that afflict our masses only serve to damage our cultures, our lives, and our future. We must work to mend the hearts and minds of the People, creating new hospitals, rehabilitation clinics, mental health centers, community outreach programs, and more all under a free and fair healthcare plan paid for and monitored by the Tribal Council and Ira Hayes."

What is being called the Fourth Navajo War, or Fifth if you count our separate and recent war against the Mexicans and the civil conflict within our ranks that ensued as war, has sparked to life. Now, we move against the Arizonans united as one, uneasy but ready to face the coming storm as we attempt to secure true independence once and for all. Temporary mass militarization and mobilization shall commence as volunteers rush to join the ranks of our braves.

Against all odds, these outgunned natives killed over 400 Spaniards and drove the remaining 2,000 or so settlers from the region. We shall embody their courage, their guerilla tactics, and their determination to fight in the face of certain annihilation, and although the Spanish returned 12 years later to finally subjugate Popay and his people, we will not make the same mistakes this time."

Though the Americans did not get very far with their studies before their fall and the arrival of the Mexicans - the coming of which prompted them to seal many of the facilities beneath the mountains - there is still a viable framework here that we can build on.

Further serving with the Americans in wars against the Navajo, the Yavapai, and the Mexicans, the Apache Scouts have a hard history to come to terms with, but their success and skill is undeniable.

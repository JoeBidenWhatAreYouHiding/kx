POLITICS_NAVAJO_DESC: "Formed officially in 1934 and headed by Henry Chee Dodge and taking inspiration from the traditional Naach’id, the Navajo Tribal Council is a loose administrative body that finds its roots in the Navajo Business Council formed in 1922. The Business Council was formed by the U.S. Secretary of the Interior along with the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and was meant to serve as the liaison between the matriarchal clan society of the Navajo and the American Government. Chiefly created because the Americans sought the valuable mineral wealth hidden beneath our sacred grounds, the Americans quickly showed their true colors as they broke deals and promises once again. When the Hoover Administration failed to pass the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, Chairman of the Business Council Chee Dodge moved to create a new, separate body - the Navajo Tribal Council - in order to serve as an organized and modern political and governmental entity, doing what the Americans failed to do in order to attempt some semblance of modern nationhood to the Navajo Nation. Though the early history of the Council was rocky, failing to be ratified three times by Navajo voters over disagreements in the use of language, the Tribal Council now firmly stands as the legislative, judicial, and executive body of our nation, while the Business Council now only controls the economy. Now growing to include representatives from all constituent tribes - each sending two delegates to each seasonal meeting - and not just the Navajo matriarchal clans, the Council has come to be our own form of native-bred representative government."
POLITICS_CHEE_DESC: "Few men are so widely respected in the traditionally matrilineal society of the Navajo as Henry Chee Dodge. Born in 1860 near Fort Defiance to split Navajo and Mexican ancestry, Dodge was only four years old when the Americans forced us on the Long Walk. Becoming separated from his mother, he became an orphan before being taken in by his Navajo aunt and Anglo-American step-uncle. This upbringing kept him rooted in his native ancestry and culture, but also allowed him to easily pick up English, becoming fluent before reaching adulthood. Serving as an translator to the Americans and rising to become the chief Navajo interpreter for the US Army before returning to the Navajo Nation in 1883 to become the police chief of the Navajo Tribal Police. Due to his standing with the Americans and his military background, Dodge was named the ‘Head Chief of the Navajo’ later that that year by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, despite no such title or position existing within Navajo society, coining the Navajo title of Tʼáá Diné Binaatʼáanii. Though this position largely just meant he was the main diplomat to the Americans, Chee continued to serve his people the best he could as the Americans continued to meddle. In 1922, he became leader of the newly created Navajo Business Council, again a move by the Americans and their BIA made to try and steal our land and our mineral wealth, though Chee Dodge was able to finesse the Imperialists in order to make the deals as profitable for the Navajo and other tribes of the Southwest as he could. When the Americans failed to pass meaningful reform for the Amerindians in 1934, Dodge took it upon himself to help his people, and formed the Navajo Tribal Council in order to create a modern functioning government for his people. With the rise of tensions in America and the eventual outbreak of the Second American Civil War and following Mexican Reconquista, Henry Chee Dodge has seized on the chance to bring sovereignty to his long-oppressed kin. Now, as one of the oldest men and most honored elders in the nation, he is set to lead his people towards independence and prosperity once and for all, no matter the direction he must take to get there."
POLITICS_HAYES_DESC:0  "Only born in 1923, Ira Hayes was one of the youngest men to serve in our fight for independence against the Mexicans and Arizonans, and yet he took up the rifle and bow anyway, ready to defend his people and bring sovereignty to the Southwestern tribes without second thought. Akimel O’odham, or Pima, by blood, Hayes hails from the Gila River community in Sacaton, Arizona, born to a volunteer veteran of the Great War and a Sunday school teacher. Raised in both the native traditions of the Pima and in the Presbyterian faith, Hayes was quick to pick up English as a child - a skill that would help propel his career due to being able to understand his eventual foes. Only a teenager when the American Civil War, and eventual Mexican Reconquista, broke out, Hayes was immersed in war from a young age, fighting to defend the Pima lands from wandering scavengers and rogue soldiers during the fighting. After the Mexicans came to dominate these lands, Hayes never dropped his rifle in fear that the Mexicans would try to do what the Americans did, and when our fight for independence began against them, he was ready. Again, only just a boy, he fought and served for his people, showing an aptitude for strategy and combat unlike any other within the Pima nation. By the time the Fourth Navajo War and our revolt against the Arizonans came around, Hayes had already been forged into a hardened soldier. Making a name for himself across the land when he raised his flag high above the Old Governor’s Mansion of Arizona where General Goldwater setup his forward base, Hayes became a hero to all overnight, becoming one of the most famous and respected Indigenous men in the Southwest, and placing him on the direct track to dethrone Chee Dodge’s decades-long dominance within the Navajo Nation. Now leading a union of all Indigenous tribes within the area, Hayes champions compassion, healing, and a drift towards true democracy while also ever-stressing the importance of militarism and ever-readiness against our eternal foes. With a soft heart, iron-hard nerves, an ever-calm demeanor, and skin of steel, Hayes is the perfect fusion of the velvet glove and the iron fist. Let us hope he can bring the paradise he promises."

##Events##
nvn.1.t: "Diné Bahaneʼ"
nvn.1.d: "’Diné Bahaneʼ’, or the Story of the People, is the general name for the Navajo creation myth that began with the Holy Wind and the Four Holy People and the Four Worlds at the Beginning, but it has also become a term used for the story of our new free and independent Navajo Nation - the modern creation myth of our once-again free people. Centuries ago, the Europeans came, and all know the tale of how they brought ruin and ‘modernity’ to this once unsullied continent. They forced the Navajo peoples and many other tribes from the East towards the West, eventually forcing us and others like us onto the reservations that exist all over North America to this day in what the Navajo call the Long Walk. Reaching its pinnacle when the Americans tried to ethnically cleanse and genocide our people in 1864, the Navajo and our related peoples of the Southwest such as the Apache, Hopi, Pima, and many more have been on the slow decline ever since, withering away under American occupation as we have tried to keep one foot in tradition and one on the road to progress and hopeful salvation. In 1922, the Navajo Business Council was created by the Bureau of Indian Affairs in order to serve as the liaison for economic and diplomatic matters between the Navajo Nation and the United States, but in reality it only served to further America’s financial interests as they stole the mineral wealth and water from our grounds in exchange for promised lands and bigger herds that never came. With Chee Dodge heading the council, he only grew to resent the Americans more, and in 1934 when the Hoover Administration tried and failed to pass the Indian Reorganization Act, Chee had finally had enough of their lies. Forming a new Tribal Council dedicated solely to political matters while the Business Council took over the economy, Chee moved to create a functioning state apparatus within the Navajo Nation, doing the job the Americans failed to do. However, as 1936 loomed, the American Civil War and later Mexican Intervention would provide the spark needed to take these nation-building plans even further. \n\nSeeing a shot at freedom once and for all when the Anglos rebelled against their new Mexican occupiers, many of our people followed Chee Dodge’s decision to aid Goldwater in his revolt, for the Tribal Chairman of the Navajo believed that working with Goldwater and winning the Anglo Revolt would finally bring equality, freedom, and relief to our long-suffering people. However, Chee Dodge was sorely wrong. With many of our people split on the decision, our own tribes suffered their own civil conflicts as families and tribes were split between those that fought on the side of the Americans and those that supported the Mexicans. Though the revolt was finally won, the scar it has left on our peoples is clearly visible, and the issues do not stop there. \n\nWith the Arizonans decision to deny us our mineral and water rights, once again breaking treaties and promises as the Americans have been so prone to do, we have been forced into war once again, but now cautiously united aiming at a shot at true independence. Away from the frontlines, Chee Dodge - once running unopposed in recent elections for leading the Navajo Nation and our new unity fire council of the various Southwestern Tribes - has now found a political rival in the young officer Ira Hayes, who has proven himself a sound, humane leader and tactical genius in both our war against the Mexicans and now in our war against the Arizonans. With our nation fighting for survival once again, with the rigors of trying to establish an independent state stacking on the strain, and with political challenges at home, our newly sovereign Navajo Nation teeters on the edge of collapse as we stand at the crossroads of destiny. Let us hope we can find a sound way through to paradise."
nvn.1.a: "Be still, and the Earth will speak to you."

nvn.2.t: "A New Naach’id"
nvn.2.d: "The Naach’id is a rarely-convened council of elders, political and spiritual leaders, and other important members of the main Navajo familial clans, tribes, and bands that is used to discuss and decide upon extremely important matters that affect the whole nation. Once convened every two to four years and staffed by two representatives (called Naalch’id) from each tribal clan, and was headed by an elder of war and an elder of peace that would guide the ceremony. However, it became a council only called to session in times of emergency in modern times, especially since the rise of the Navajo Business and Tribal Councils in 1922 and 1934. Not convened in decades, this new Naach’id is special, for it has included the tribal elders and leaders of our fellow tribes in the Southwestern Unity Pact, including chiefs, chairmen, and presidents from the Ute, the Apache, the Hopi, the Pueblo, the Pima, the Yaqui, the Zuni, and the other local tribes of the Four Corners region, causing quite the controversy among the more traditional members of the Navajo. Even more controversial has been the decision to allow the surviving leaders of the Arizonans also be in attendance, for their fates shall be decided here as well, though they will have no say, and should any even speak, they will be thrown out of the proceedings. The Naach’id has been called mainly to discuss the future of our newly independent Navajo Nation, with this group chiefly desiring to discuss just how ‘Navajo’ the new Nation shall be. Though the Navajo, led by Tribal Chairman and former chief Chee Dodge, dominate this new state in terms of population and political influence, the other half of this coalition, though varied and factionalist, still holds great sway, especially since our war for independence could not have been won without them and their leader Ira Hayes. Though normal elections for the leader of the Navajo Nation usually never require the Naach’id being convened, the extraneous circumstances of this new reality have called for its use, and now the choice is up to this council of esteemed elders on who shall lead our newly free Amerindian nation?"
nvn.2.a: "Go with the tribal unity group of war hero Ira Hayes."
nvn.2.b: "Side with Navajo interests and Chee Dodge."

nvn.3.t: "The Second Order of Business for the Naach’id"
nvn.3.d: "With the leadership debate out of the way, the second main topic in discussion within the Naach’id is to be the fate of the Arizonans. Our group has largely been split into three factions over what should be the fate of the Anglos. The dominant opinion is to have the leaders of the revolt, including the infamous ‘Man of Gold and Water’, executed while the bulk of their populace will be allowed to peacefully integrate into our society. This option would leave some resentment in their mouths, but limit their ability to retaliate and offer them a gateway to becoming an equal citizen in our state, which would likely be best over the long term. Alternatively, the two other factions within the Naach’id argue over either pardoning their leaders fully and while working towards integration, which would cause the least amount of unrest among their numbers but also leave their leaders free to spread rhetoric against us, and the drastic alternative. This alternative would see the Anglo leaders hanged and the reservation system revived but reversed, forcing the massive population of Arizonans into large reservations on barren land with powerless autonomy, living as we once did under their regime. The least human option, it would cause unrest but at least ensure the Arizonanas do not have the supplies necessary to rise in violence ever again. What should we do?"
nvn.3.a: "Pardon their leaders and work towards peaceful integration."
nvn.3.b: "Hang their leaders, and integrate them as peacefully as possible."
nvn.3.c: "Reverse the long-standing reservation system, giving them powerless autonomy."


nvn.5.t: "Internal Elections Within the Fire Council Coalition"
nvn.5.d: "With the parties finally organized and the people ready to finally have their voices heard, the first elections of our new Tribal Union are being held. Though Ira Hayes shall remain as President, these elections will determine who rules alongside him, and what general political plan we will follow going forward. With the progresive Social Democratic unity coalition of Hayes, backed by the Pima, Ute, Yaqui, Zuni, and other Puebloans, and the Capitalist moguls of the Navajo Business Council being the main two parties in the running, many prepare for one of these two groups to win out. However, none should discount the rising tide of the Hopi liberals or the Apache conservatives, for both groups still stand a good chance at victory in this split field. Let the votes be counted!"
nvn.5.a: "The progressive unity coalition headed by the Pima, Ute, and Zuni wins out."
nvn.5.b: "The Hopi liberals shall guide the state strong and true."
nvn.5.c: "Go with the cautious capitalists at the Navajo Business Council."
nvn.5.e: "Align with the Apache conservatives and traditionalists."

nvn.8.t: "The Extent of Athabascan Unity"
nvn.8.d: "The Na-Dené, or Athabascan, ethnolinguistic group describes all related peoples to the Navajo that speak a similar language to our own and have a similar ethnic heritage. This linguistic group is split into three main groups,  being the Southern Na-Dené which includes our people across the Four Corners region as well as neighboring groups such as the Mescalero-Chiricahua speakers to the South and in Texas and the Kiowa-Apache of Oklahoma, the Central Na-Dené of the American Pacific Northwest, and the Northern Na-Dené which stretch from the Dakleh and Nicola of Southern British Columbia all the way up through the Yukon and Alaska. With our decision to attempt to unite the Na-Dené, we must decide how far we are willing to go. Should we only take the Southern Na-Dené of the American Southwest, or should we attempt to unify all the Na-Dené speakers under one banner?"
nvn.8.a: "We will not rest until all the Na-Dené are within our borders."
nvn.8.b: "We already have enough mouths to feed. Keep our claims on the smaller side."

nvn.9.t: "The Extent of Uto-Aztek Unity"
nvn.9.d: "The Uto-Aztek language group describes all related peoples to the Pima that speak a similar language and share a similar ethnic background and ancestry. As an ethnolingusitic group, it extends as far south as Nicaragua, Honduras, and El Salvador, and as far North as the lands of the Shoshone in Idaho, also including the lands of the Comanche in Texas and the Tongva and other tribes of Southern California. With our decision to attempt to unite the Uto-Azteka, we must decide how far we are willing to go. Should we only go after the lands of the Uto-Azteka close to use around the American Southwest and in Texas, or should we spread farther North and deep in the South of Mexico and Central America in order to claim the fallen empires of the Aztecs and Maya, uniting all Uto-Aztek speakers under one banner?"
nvn.9.a: "We will not rest until all the Uto-Azteka are within our borders."
nvn.9.b: "We already have enough mouths to feed. Keep our claims on the smaller side."

nvn.10.t: "The Fate of Our Four Corners Project"
nvn.10.d: "As we go about uniting the Four Corners regions and the Amerindians that lie within, should we embrace a strictly Navajo identity or should we move to embrace the pan-tribal identity of all within our growing Union?"
nvn.10.a: "Proclaim the Tribal Federation of the Southwest."
nvn.10.b: "Maintain our Navajo identity."


nvn.12.t: "A Capitalist Paradise"
nvn.12.d: "Seeking to bring about an economic miracle for our people, Chairman Chee and the Business Council have turned to new methods to breathe life into the economy. By brewing our own tequila, processing local peyote, growing large fields of hemp, marijuana, and tobacco, and by opening up casinos and gambling havens, we will create a Capitalist paradise that cashes in on what the West finds taboo, driving foreign business into our markets. With near total economic power due to his roots in the Business Council through his son, Chee Dodge is free to do as he pleases as he accelerates the economy and Navajo Capitalism into overdrive to make himself, his family, and the People all incredibly wealthy, prosperous, and happy. With changes like these, we will build a golden city here for all to enjoy."
nvn.12.a: "All for the good of the people."


nvn.13.t: "Traditionalist Revivalism"
nvn.13.d: "Displaying levels of populism bordering on Socialism, revering tradition and authoritarian conservatism, and holding a deep love for Capitalism and his people and their culture, the regime of Chief Dodge is strange to say the least. Through syncretic ideas and Paternalism, a unique political and economic system has been created that works for our people and provides all with what they need. As Chief Chee further expands these ideas, he also moves to have his family embrace these ideas as well, for his daughter Annie and son Thomas who aid him in his rule will eventually be his successors in this newly hereditary chiefdom, so that these ideas are enshrined forever. Though his son leans more into paternalism and capitalism while his daughter is more a preacher of populism, cultural revivalism, and tribal unity. Together, they serve to balance Chee’s views, and help him forge this Chiefdom into a perfect paradise for our chosen people."
nvn.13.a: "All hail the Chief. All hail the old ways."

nvn.14.t: "An Open Society"
nvn.14.d: "Seeking to shine light on the forgotten ones, President Hayes’ unity council has gone to great efforts to listen to the needs and wants of the smaller tribes and populations within our state, such as his own tribe the Pima, along with the Puebloans and others. However, he has also moved to incorporate non-Indigenous representatives and opinions as well, for despite our history, they are still part of this new nation, and as such, they must be accounted for. Letting bygones be bygones, an open, unbiased, fair, and free society will be created where all can speak their mind and say their truth without fear of reprisal. Together, we will build our perfect paradise."
nvn.14.a: "All will be welcome, no matter the past."

nvn.15.t: "A Stratocratic State"
nvn.15.d: "The stratocratic regime of Commander and Chief Ira Hayes has only begun to fully take effect, with society militarizing and adjusting to the new ever-ready reality. Mandatory military service with a minimum of 2 years has been made standard for both men and women, and all are trained in multiple disciplines to ensure that we are always ready and that all of our troops can fill holes in the hierarchy or supply line if necessary during times of war. All those that do their service shall be considered full citizens, able to vote and and enjoy the rights and privileges of the state. Those that cannon fight shall simply serve their 2 years aiding the state and the military in other ways. All will learn survival training, and all will know the basic ethnobotany of our people. No man left behind, and no job is too difficult. We will build a state as solid as steel and as strong as titanium, but one that is soft and yielding to its own people and their needs."
nvn.15.a: "All for the good of the People."

nvn.16.t: "Organization of Democratic Parties"
nvn.16.d: "President Hayes, seeking to bring about American-styled multi-party democracy to our nation, has begun to organize new political parties for the people to vote on and support. Though the parties are already being divided along ethnic lines more than political ones, the trends still exist, and four general factions have coalesced. The first and largest group are the Navajo Business Council and their Capitalist allies, seeking to bring moderated Capitalism and privatization to the state. Opposing them as the second largest group is the Social Democratic and Progressive coalition of Ira Hayes, mainly made up of Pima, Zuni, Ute, Yaqui, and the other Puebloans, all united in a push for tribal unity, syncretism, and progressivism. Smaller than these two groups, but still well in the running, are the Hopi liberals who seek a moderate balance between progressive reform, capitalist innovation, and reverence for tradition, and the conservative and hyper-traditionalist clique dominated by the Apache. As each group organizes and begins to campaign, we shall continue to organize the coming elections so that one of these new political bodies can come to dictate the direction and destiny of the state."
nvn.16.a: "Now, on to the elections!"


nvn.19.t: "A Mini Comancheria"
nvn.19.d: "We have taken the lands of Texas, and with it, we now control the plains and badlands, the wild and infamous Comanche ride free. Granting them widespread autonomy within our own borders in exchange for military and economic aid, the Comanche shall carve out their own mini Comancheria within our state as we work together for the benefit of all First Peoples in our union."
nvn.19.a: "We will grant autonomy to our old friends and all who follow."

nvn.20.t: "Family Ties"
nvn.20.d: "Henry Chee Dodge has had many allies and friends help him over his long and storied career, but no associates are closer to him and his own successes like his two children Thomas and Annie. With Thomas leading the Business Council and serving as his father’s right-hand man, and with Annie being the first woman on the Tribal Council and one of the main cultural leaders of the state, Chee Dodge always has backup and a force to lean on when the rigors of rule get to be too much for his aging soul. As he grows older, Thomas and Annie have taken over more and more of his duties, and it likely won’t be long before one of them is officially groomed to be his eventual successor."
nvn.20.a: "No allies like family."

nvn.21.t: "Formation of the Union Braves"
nvn.21.d: "A new special forces group based on the experiences of Ira Hayes and on the training of the United States Army Rangers, the Apache Scouts, and the Tribal Police shall be created in order to meet the needs of the state for an elite fighting force. Trained especially in alpine combat, as paratroopers, and as marines, these new Union Braves will be the cream of the crop and the top of the top in our military, bred to be living war machines and each required to complete the steps required to become a full warchief, such as the counting coup. Behind this elite and small force, we shall never falter, and we will give our enemies hell."
nvn.21.a: "Through hell or high water, the Union Braves always get the job done."

nvn.22.t: "Frybread!"
nvn.22.d: "Fry bread, or frybread, is a traditional food of the Navajo made of a flat dough bread that is fried or deep-fried in oil, shortening, or lard, and prepared with very simple ingredients such as wheat flour, fat, sugar, and salt, though can also be served with toppings like honey, jam, venison, or beef. According to Navajo tradition, frybread was invented in 1864 using the flour, salt, and lard given to them by the American government when the Navajo were forced on the Long Walk to the Arizona reservations, then spread to other tribes. As such, the food has an imperialist history, and is purposefully unhealthy as it was the only food the Americans would spare to the First Peoples. \n\nThis history has caused many traditionalists and anti-American activists within the nation to try and outlaw the public support of frybread, though such a movement has little support due to the widespread love for these delicious snacks. Though most do not wish to see these tasty treats banned, and though we will never forget the painful history that caused them to be invented or needed, the radical anti-Imperialists still wish to see that state publicly denounce their creation and cease serving them at official gatherings. Now we must decide. Shall we eat them not because we are forced to by the Imperialists, but because we want to because they taste good and have become part of our culture and history, or shall we move to publicly denounce this unhealthy product of the dire situations American imperialism pushed us to and purge it from our culture?"
nvn.22.a: "A delicious, if unhealthy, snack. Allow the people to eat as they please."
nvn.22.b: "A dangerous reminder of Imperialism. Condemn the creation and consumption of frybread!"


nvn.23.t: "The Hopi Sages Speak"
nvn.23.d: "With the recent testing of our new nuclear device, the nation has been shocked not only by this display of raw power and scientific might, but also by the resistance against such a move coming from the unlikeliest of places. Four Hopi sages, named Dan Evehema, Thomas Banyacya, David Monongye, and Dan Katchongva, came out to speak against our actions. Normally a quiet, private, and reserved people, the Hopi have sent these sages to reveal their secretive ways, wisdoms, and prophecies, allowing our other peoples and peoples around the world to finally learn more about these interesting natives. However, their main prophesy - and their reason for speaking up in the first place - tells of the Blue Star Kachina, or Saquasohuh as the Hopi call it, that will signify the coming of a new age for the world. The ninth and final sign of the Day of Purification, or the final apocalypse of the Earth in a world-engulfing cataclysm, is the appearance of this Saquasohuh, and when it comes, humanity will be at a crossroads between life and death. Seeing these nuclear tests as the coming of the Blue Star, the Hopi urge our government to throw away the secrets of nuclear technology and stray from sharing it with the world, lest we all face the apocalypse."
nvn.23.a: "Perhaps we should heed these warnings?"



nvn.25.t: "The Flag Flies High"
nvn.25.d: "Fighting tooth and nail to end the revolt, Ira Hayes led a detachment of 250 braves just behind enemy lines to secure the Old Governor’s Mansion in Prescott, Arizona. Though not used for political office, it had recently become the forward command center of General Barry Goldwater, leader of the Arizona forces fighting to crush our attempt at independence. Moving on the compound, the fighting was fast, bloody, and fierce, but Ira Hayes and his men moved hard and quickly in order to crush their foes as they hid in their den. Though casualties were high, and though Goldwater was able to slink away and escape, the mansion was taken and the Yankees forced to flee as Hayes and a small squad climbed the roof of the building and raised their flag high while loosing a terrifying warcry to the heavens. Coming back later to take a photo of the scene after this hard fought victory, this moment will always be remembered as the moment our independence was secured. Though Ira Hayes assaulted the mansion with 249 other braves, only 17 survived to make the trip back down, but each and every one of them will forever be remembered as heroes, and Ira Hayes will make sure of that."
nvn.25.a: "Among the men who held it high was the Indian Ira Hayes."

nvn.26.t: "The Beginnings of Navajo Genetic Medicine"
nvn.26.d: "The tribes of the Southwest have unique genetic mutations within their genes that cause them to be more susceptible to certain diseases, particularly among the Navajo and Apache. Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, or SCID, is uniquely common among our people, otherwise being an incredibly rare disorder, and has been the cause of numerous deadly and costly outbreaks in the past. Similarly, the Navajo also are more commonly afflicted by the rare mitochondrial mutation called Neurohepatopathology, which can cause severe birth defects and death among newborns like SCID. These genetic disorders have led to our peoples having higher than normal infant mortality rates. As we work to expand our healthcare system and further our understanding of medical science, we shall also work in the fields of biology and genetics in order to find cures to these terrible afflictions, as well as other common afflictions for our people such as diabetes. Though we are likely decades away from a true cure, the work must start somewhere, so let us begin."
nvn.26.a: "The odyssey of science and progress never ends."

nvn.27.t: "Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park"
nvn.27.d: "In order to better preserve the natural and ecological beauty and diversity of our nation, the Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park has been founded on Navajo tribal land near Window Rock, though it is collectively owned by the entire state. Complete with its own gardens, zoo exhibits, and even its own geodesic dome housing a small man-made oasis exhibit, the Navajo Nation Zoological and Botanical Park is sure to be a popular site, though it being built on such sacred ground has annoyed some traditionalists within the state. Even given its own cartoon mascot, an American black bear named Yogi, this new natural reserve is sure to be the hotspot of the region despite pushback from the traditionalists, and we hope that many unique species of flora and fauna come to call this place home."
nvn.27.a: "We will showcase the unique biome we call home."


nvn.28.t: "Building Up Window Rock"
nvn.28.d: "Window Rock, called Tségháhoodzání in the Navajo language, is the capital of our state, and named after the unique rock arch located on the site. Newly created in 1936 from the few sparse settlements and ranches in the area, Window Rock is a brand new city; just barely older than our infantile nation itself. As such, we have much work to do in order to make this a fully functional and outfitted national capital, so we must get to work on building the first true planned city in indigenous America. All that is left to decide is how the city should be designed. Should we favor a more Navajo-oriented design with their architecture and culture in mind, given that the city is on their land and was first founded by them, or should we move in a more inclusive direction, incorporating designs, ideas, needs, and cultural notes of all the tribes in our union?"
nvn.28.a: "We will favor the Navajo here at Tségháhoodzání."
nvn.28.b: "All tribes have a place at Window Rock."

nvn.29.t: "Linguistic Revivalism"
nvn.29.d: "In order to better distinguish our current reality from our Imperialist past while also seeking to preserve our unique cultures, a program of language revivalism shall be pursued. All indigenous languages within our borders from the Apache and Navajo to the Ute and Zuni will be revived and taught to the masses, slowly becoming the dominant languages used by our government and state. Though English and Spanish will always be around, we will rely on them less and less as we seek to undo the linguistic and cultural damage done to the People."
nvn.29.a: "Turning back the clock on our nearly-extinct languages."

nvn.30.t: "Archeological Preservation"
nvn.30.d: "The American Southwest is host to a large number of sacred sites, archaeological hotspots, and other points of cultural significance and historical relevance that deserve to be preserved and protected. Archaeological sites like the relic Puebloan Dwellings spread throughout Four Corners, Chaco Canyon, the Taos Pueblo, the Acoma Pueblo, Casa Grande shall all be preserved and studied, for these buildings go as far back as 750 AD, and are the oldest still-surviving buildings in all of North America; incredibly well-preserved by the blasting sands of the desert and time. They are our links to our past and the past of all human life in the New World, so let us embrace this legacy."
nvn.30.a: "The true first children of the Southwest revealed."

nvn.31.t: "The Raids of the Bilagáana"
nvn.31.d: "Local towns, settlements, and ranches on the outskirts of our borders have been besieged by marauding bands of Bilagáana - White Devils - rampaging against our new state, with the surviving Arizona Rangers being a particular thorn in our side. To combat these roughriders, a new division within the Tribal Police shall be made, specially trained and specifically equipped to hunt down and execute these terrorists. No berzerk Bilagáana will come to ruin our paradise, even if these once-proud veterans of Arizona’s failed military must all be jailed or put down like dogs."
nvn.31.a: "A dirty and hard job, but one that must be done."

nvn.32.t: "A Local Hero"
nvn.32.d: "Many heroes and martyrs were made during our wars for independence, for the crucible of war is where true legends are forged. One such hero of our revolt is the young Hashkasilt Begay, also known as Peter MacDonald. Serving under Ira Hayes during the war, MacDonald and Hayes grew close as Hayes took him under his wing, with MacDonald even being in the squad that helped Hayes raise their flag above the Arizonans. Following the war, he finished his education as an engineer and began working for a local airforce company that sourced planes from the Hughes Aircraft Company. Notably a fan of the politics of Barry Goldwater, MacDonald has long delved into Libertarian and Capitalist ventures of dubious moral standing, and has fallen into controversies following his service over allegations of corruption, bribery, and fraud when not tinkering with planes, and was even involved in a minor land dispute with a Hopi member of our union. Regardless of his service, MacDonald is proof that not all veterans are perfect heroes."
nvn.32.a: "Perhaps not all heroes are perfect."

nvn.33.t: "A Win for Our Foremothers" 
nvn.33.d: "In a move that has been seen as indicative of a new age for our nation, activist Annie Dodge - daughter of Chee Dodge - and Lilakai Julian Neil have been elected by the people as the first two women ever to serve in the Tribal Council. Though Navajo society has long been matriarchal, the Council was originally created as a tool for the Americans and their Bureau of Indian Affairs, and as such, no women have ever served in its ranks before. A major victory for women all through our nation, let us hope these intelligent females can help [root.getleader] guide our nation towards a better tomorrow."
nvn.33.a: "The First Woman, White Shell Woman and Changing Woman would all be proud."

nvn.34.t: "Cross-Tribal Training"
nvn.34.d: "The Navajo Nation Police Department and the Oglala Lakota Police Department in South Dakota are the two largest indigenous police forces in North America. Though our Oglala friends do not have their independence, that will not stop us from training with their officers in order to benefit both of our forces. We shall show them the tricks we have learned fighting the Arizonans, Mexicans, and Americans, and they shall teach us all their special strategies in turn, especially their aptitude for the ways of horseback combat. Together, we will both learn to better protect and serve our peoples."
nvn.34.a: "For the good of all First Peoples."


nvn.35.t: "Incessant Bickering"
nvn.35.d: "Two matrilineal clans of the Navajo have recently gotten into a dispute over land rights to a local cattle ranch, and it is up to [root.getleader] to resolve the issue. One clan claims that the land should belong to her own family because her grandmother once worked these pastures decades ago, while the other clan claims that their great-great grandmother worked these plains, so they are entitled to the ranch instead. Such a delicate decision is commonplace in the daily duties of our national leader, but such things must be handled to keep the state running and our traditions intact."
nvn.35.a: "Award the ranch to the clan with the stronger claim."
nvn.35.b: "Award the ranch to the clan with the older claim."

nvn.36.t: "Ethnobotany"
nvn.36.d: "The peoples of the Southwest, particularly the Navajo and the Zuni, have long used local plants to create medicine and other useful products for the People. From Viola nephrophylla used by the Ramah Navajo in rituals and medicine to cause rapid vomiting to Carex seeds which are ground into a common snack, the plants of the Southwest can be incredibly useful. There is Abronia fragrans, used medicinally for boils and taken internally if one swallows poisonous insects or spiders, or as a cathartic, for insect bites, as a sudorific, as an emetic, for stomach cramps, and as a general panacea. The Ramah Navajo even use it as a lotion for sores or sore mouths and to bathe perspiring feet. There's Rocky Mountain Maple, frequently ground into a mash and used as a general cure-all and swelling reducer. New Mexican giant hyssop can be used to repel deer from crops and to keep witches away, or to reduce fever, sores, coughs, and cankers if ingested, and is also made into a lotion for chanting rituals. Southern Maidenhair ferns can help ease insect stings while Western Yarrow can help with saddle sores, be made into a general health tonic, help with headaches, and reduce sores from wearing ceremonial masks. \n\nAgave can be drunk as a water substitute, made into alcohol, baked and eaten, and used in rope making or in baking pits as fuel or flavoring. Artemisia tridentata can stop chafing and swelling, ease snakebites if applied to wounds quickly enough, and be used as a laxative or a diaphoretic, while Brownfoot can be used to ease labor pains and postpartum depression. Pinus flexilis makes good wood for bows while Fendlera rupicola’s bark can kill lice and its wood makes amazing arrow shafts and ceremonial plumes, while Prunus americana makes the best red dyes. Lycium pallidum can even be used to soothe chicken pox, Juniperus communis can help with diabetes, and Sticky Snakeweed is good for healing the sores and wounds of our horses. Though many alternative healing methods are bunk, we truly know the ways of natural healing, and our people benefit from it."
nvn.36.a: "Nature’s gifts to those who know how to find them."

nvn.37.t: "The Native American Church Takes Root"
nvn.37.d: "With our independence secured and with the state now largely stabilizing, missionaries from the Native American Church located in Oklahoma have come to set up a branch of their religion here in our union. Famous for their use of tobacco and peyote in their religious ceremonies, the Native American Church has been allowed to enter the state and set up shop, though they will get no special attention from the government. They shall be free, as all indeigenous religions are, to be practiced and preached within our borders so long as they do not force their views on any others. Who knows, maybe hallucinogens will do some of our people some good."
nvn.37.a: "Yet another facet of Indigenous culture to embrace."

nvn.38.t: "Celebrating Our Unique Cultural Practices"
nvn.38.d: "Revolving around the myth of the Changing Woman, a Navajo goddess and deity of maturation and growth, the Kinaaldȧ is a coming of age ceremony all Navajo woman go through. Occurring after their first menstrual cycle and lasting four days, the ceremony once mainly held significance as signaling when a Navajo woman was ready to bear children and be a full woman in the matriarchal society. However, with our modernizing pushes, the ceremony has come to be more about women empowerment and the fostering of kinship and support between women in the tribe. \n\nAnother cultural quirk of the Navajo making a resurgence are the song ceremonial complexes - a group of spiritual practices used to maintain balance and harmony in the lives of the practitioner and those who they channel it upon. Taking the form of beautiful and haunting chants, the Changways and Blessingway are just some of the complexes, and some are frequently paired with the Kinaaldȧ to center the spirits of the women as they enter adulthood. Unique cultural practices like these and more shall be revived and protected as we strive for modernity, and tweaked to fit contemporary realities and sensibilities as we go along."
nvn.38.a: "Let our sounds soothe the troubles of maturation."

nvn.39.t: "A Change in Lexicon"
nvn.39.d: "The word Navajo is a term coined by our former Spanish oppressors, coming from their name for us, the ‘Apaches de Navajó’ or Apaches from Navajo. With Athabascia and the lands of the Na-Dené under our control and with the Imperialist identity of this land being finally purged, Chee Dodge has moved to ban the word Navajo as a slur. We shall forever only be known by our own word for our people, the Diné, or Na-Dené when referring to our specific ethnolinguistic family. Furthermore, the White identity of all shall be eroded or made second-class as Amerindian culture and Diné traditions become dominant in this new paradise. We will undo the damage wrought on our people without stooping to their genocidal and destructive ways."
nvn.39.a: "Call us Diné, or call us nothing at all."

nvn.40.t: "The Uto-Aztek Unity Council"
nvn.40.d: "With the lands of the Uto-Aztek ethnolinguistic group being consolidated and integrated into the wider fabric of the state, Ira Hayes has gone ahead with his plan to expand the Tribal Council. Creating the Uto-Aztek Unity Council, this new legislative, executive, and judicial body will include members from every single constituent tribe within the nation, and will even include a small group of non-Indigneous members to ensure that their voice is heard as well. Headed by Ira Hayes and his appointed cabinet that serve as the highest judges, legislators, and executives on the council, this new governmental structure will assuredly bring true representative democracy to the people, allowing us to address their needs and wants as they arise, fairly and without bias."
nvn.40.a: "Together towards a brighter future."

nvn.41.t: "Miss Navajo Nation"
nvn.41.d: "Seeking to create a platform to spread ideas of feminism, woman empowermant, and cultural preservation, the Navajo within our union have moved to create the Miss Navajo Nation pageant. Despite its name, it is open to women of all tribal backgrounds within our union, and unlike American or European pageants, the competition is about ‘heads and hands’ over bodily beauty. Contestants are required to perform and compete in numerous traditional practices from fry bread making, spiritual healing, and blanket weaving to sheep shearing, horse rearing, and cattle butchering. The winner of each year’s competition will serve as the ambassador and representative for women in the nation at any and all official meetings of the government, and will also work with a foundation to expand women’s rights in the nation. \n\nThe mission statement reads as follows: ‘In keeping with Navajo culture and tradition, the role of Miss Navajo Nation is to exemplify the essence and characters of First Woman, White Shell Woman and Changing Woman and to display leadership as the Goodwill Ambassador. Miss Navajo Nation represents womanhood and fulfills the role of 'grandmother, mother, aunt, and sister' to the Navajo people; therefore she can speak as a leader, teacher, counselor, advisor and friend. It shall be the mission of the Office of Miss Navajo Nation to encourage every Navajo to assist in the preservation of Navajo culture and Miss Navajo Nation will represent the importance of Navajo women with respect and honor.’"
nvn.41.a: "May these women be an inspiration to little girls across the nation."

nvn.42.t: "Reviving the Ghost Dance"
nvn.42.d: "Beginning among the Paiute by Elder Wodziwob and Wovoka in 1889 and 1890 after they received numerous visions from the ancestors, the Ghost Dance is a syncretic cultural and spiritual movement that combined ideas and traditions from numerous tribes in order to spiritually heal the people as well as to encourage pan-tribal unity and resistance against the Americans. Popular with the Lakota, the Paiute, and the tribes of California and Oklahoma as well as the states in between, the Ghost Dance Movement led to an increase in anti-American rhetoric and resistance action that culminated in acts like the Wounded Knee Massacre and the Ghost Dance War. Seeking to revive this syncretic movement due to its ideas of pan-Native Americanism aligning with our current goals and actions, the Ghost Dance religion shall be revived and supported by the state, though we will not go so far as to declare it a state religion. It shall merely be one of the many native religions and spiritual philosophies supported by the state for matters of cultural growth and preservation. "
nvn.42.a: "The white man says that the 1890 massacre was the end of the wars with the Indian, the end of the Ghost Dance. Yet here we are at war, we're still Indians, and we're Ghost Dancing again."

nvn.43.t: "Expanding Turquoise Mining"
nvn.43.d: "Turquoise mining and usage has long been a common craftform for the Navajo and Pueblo peoples, with jewelry both for spiritual usage and decoration being commonplace. However, turquoise is perhaps even more loved by outsiders, who frequently go nuts over the blue-green stone’s beauty and the idea of purchasing native-made goods. In order to capitalize on this fad, we have moved to expand turquoise mining and the production of turquoise goods shall increase to meet the demand of our foreign buyers."
nvn.43.a: "This will surely sell well with the eclectic and quirky types."

nvn.44.t: "The Renaming of Squaw Tits"
nvn.44.d: "The Squaw Tits is a 12,000 foot tall summit in Maricopa County, Arizona that was named in reference to its shape. Looking like a pair of breasts poking out from the arid desert around it, Squaw Tits may be a humorous name, but also carries the derogatory slur used against Indigneous women by our former oppressors. We shall move to rename the mountain Isanaklesh Peaks after the Apache goddess, and hold a special Isanaklesh Gotal, or ceremonial singing dedicated to the goddess, in order to consecrate the peak as a new holy site, wiping away the imperialist taint from the land once and for all."
nvn.44.a: "Praise be to the Mother Isanaklesh."

nvn.45.t: "A Proposition on the Tlingit"
nvn.45.d: "To the North, the Tlingit - our fellow Na-Dené and tribe famed for their totem poles, basket weaving, beautiful Chilkat robes and their skill at hunting the beasts of the Pacific Northwest seas - have earned their freedom. Should we welcome these linguistic brothers into our growing union, or shall we leave them to their own fate."
nvn.45.a: "Welcome these fellow Na-Dené to our union."
nvn.45.b: "We do not need more mouths to feed in far off lands."

nvn.46.t: "Going Beyond the Realm of the Na-Dené"
nvn.46.d: "We have pushed out to the boundaries of North America, conquering all the lands of the Dene-speaking people. Our main ethno-linguistic group has been united, but some still call for more. The Athabascan-Eyak-Tlingit, or Na-Dené, language group is only one half of a fractured whole, for across the Bering Sea and far off into the heart of Russia lies our long-lost ethnic kin. The peoples of the Yeniseian River in central Siberia speak a language similar to our own and share many physiological features that we do, leading some anthropologists and linguists to believe they are our distant kin. At our current size and power, taking on one of the world superpowers would be a challenge, but an achievable one. Should we attempt to liberate our long lost ancestral cousins in Siberia, or begin to turn inwards and focus on building our paradise?"
nvn.46.a: "Onwards to Dené–Yeniseia!"
nvn.46.b: "We have no desire to throw the lives of our men away in the cold wastes of Siberia."

nvn.47.t: "Dené–Yeniseia is Secured!"
nvn.47.d: "We have taken the lands of the Yeniseians and united our long-fractured ethnolinguistic group. Now, should we proclaim a new state to match our new identity, or should we stay true to the identity that carried us since our independence?"
nvn.47.a: "Proclaim the state of Dené–Yeniseia!"
nvn.47.b: "We shall stick with the Athabascan identity of the Na-Dené."
nvn.47.c: "Go farther with the ethnolinguistic theory and proclaim Dené–Caucasia!"

nvn.48.t: "The Shoshone Enter the Fold"
nvn.48.d: "The Shoshone of Idaho, Wyoming, Nevada, California, and Utah, along with their neighboring tribes, have begun to be integrated into our Uto-Aztek union. Famous to the world for Sacajawea, the native guide on the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the tribe is chiefly split into two groups. One half that adopted the horse and buffalo culture of the Plains Indians once the Europeans introduced horses to America, and another half that stayed behind and stuck to their old ways in the forests of their native home. Their numbers have been admitted into our union as full citizens, and both aspects of their culture shall be embraced by the state, with our military in particular interested in their expertise at tracking, horseback riding, and mountain survival skills. They are sure to make a fine addition to the union."
nvn.48.a: "Sutummu Tukummuinna."

nvn.49.t: "Strange Theories on Our Origins"
nvn.49.d: "There exists a strange, outlandish theory among some scholars, racial theorists, pseudoscientists, and conspiracy theorists that has begun to take hold in the dark recesses of our state. It states that the first inhabitants of Meso-America do not come from the Sibero-Mongolic peoples from the Beringian land bridge that North and South Amerindians largely descend from, but instead are the descendants of a separate lineage of New World colonizers. They suggest that the Meso-Americans, including the Maya, Aztec, Pima, and the rest of Meso-America along with the entire Uto-Aztek language group, all descend from White-skinned colonizers hailing from North Africa and Iberia during the time of Carthage. Though ridiculously bizarre and insanely improbable, that has not stopped some from subscribing to the idea. The theory regrettably gained international attention when German Rosicrucian and occultist physician Arnold Krumm-Heller, hiding out in Mexico, openly praised the idea, writing about it at length and even getting his friend and ally Nicolás Carrasco to become interested in the idea. No matter what others say, we know this to be absolute nonsense, and borderline offensive. We should probably forget these theories at once."
nvn.49.a: "Absolutely preposterous...unless."

nvn.50.t: "Second Thoughts on Strange Theories"
nvn.50.d: "Despite our best intentions and efforts, the strange theories on our racial origins have begun to surface again. The supporters of these theories, some of whom are even within our government, call for the invasion of this so-called ‘homeland’ in what once was Carthage, seeking our empire to stretch to Iberia and North Africa. We need to decide our stance on these theories firmly and finally, and act in the way we think is best for the nation."
nvn.50.a: "Ban these ideas and erase any and all trace of this insane, offensive theory."
nvn.50.b: "Perhaps these nutjobs have a point. At least it means more land."

nvn.51.t: "A New Identity for the Expanded Empire?"
nvn.51.d: "Embracing the outlandish theories of our origins, we have conquered the lands of Iberia and old Carthage - the supposed birthplace of the original ancestors of the Uto-Azteks. Now that this new swathe of territory is under our control, many have pushed for us to embrace our new identity as Uto-Aztlān, with the new name of our state and identity no longer be exclusive to our new subjects and named after the mythical birthplace of the Aztec gods. Alternatively, we can keep our Uto-Aztek identity and continue on our path as we integrate these new lands."
nvn.51.a: "We are Uto-Azteks, now and forever."
nvn.51.b: "Embrace the Uto-Aztlān identity."

nvn.53.t: "A Militarized Unity Pact Under Commander and Chief Hayes"
nvn.53.d: "Fighting for our independence and struggling to build a sovereign nation was never going to be an easy task, but under the brilliant leadership of Commander and Chief Ira Hayes, we have begun to build a paradise for the People. Our stratocratic populist state is ever ready to defend our infantile pan-tribal union no matter the cost, and Hayes rules with a velvet glove dipped in iron, providing the firm but gentle and pliable guiding hand needed to build an independent, sovereign, and self-sufficient union. Mandatory military service and the wider militarization of society may have brought us some growing pains, but the protected paradise it has allowed to form is well worth the price of losing a few simple liberties, and Hayes’ health and education reforms have only brought greater standards of living to the masses. Under Commander and Chief Hayes, we shall only know new glories, victories, and progress. Let us embrace our new future with arms wide open as Hayes continues to guide all Amerindians within our union to utopia."

nvn.54.t: "Amerindian Republicanism and Democracy Under President Hayes"
nvn.54.d: "Fighting for our independence and struggling to build a sovereign nation was never going to be an easy task, but under the brilliant leadership of President Ira Hayes, we have begun to build a paradise for the People. Under President Hayes and his democratically chosen allies, we shall only know new freedoms, liberties, and progress, all without losing touch with the unique individual cultures and traditions from each constituent tribe of our union, and Hayes’ health and education reforms have only brought greater standards of living to the masses. Regardless of which party runs the state with Hayes, we shall forever endeavor to build a true, fair, and free democracy here for the People as we construct this glorious republican pan-tribal union. Let us embrace our new future with arms wide open as Hayes continues to guide all Amerindians within our union to utopia."
nvn.54.a: "They call him the hero Ira Hayes."

nvn.55.t: "A Capitalist Paradise Under Chairman Chee"
nvn.55.d: "Fighting for our independence and struggling to build a sovereign nation was never going to be an easy task, but under the brilliant leadership of Chairman Henry Chee Dodge, we have begun to build a paradise for the People. The economy hums along like never before, bringing new riches to the Navajo and the wider tribes of our union, with new mining operations, mineral and oil refinery centers, casinos, cash crop fields, hemp processing centers, ranches, slaughterhouses and more popping up all over the nation. Though Navajo culture is dominant, all tribes and First Peoples are welcome within our union, for Chee Dodge cares for all true sons and daughters of the People. Under the direction of the Tribal Council and the Business Council, Chairman Chee Dodge has brought about a true economic miracle here in Dinétah. Now, let us hope that he and his family can continue to bring these riches and successes to our people for many more generations to come as we build a profitable, prosperous Capitalist haven here in the Southwest."
nvn.55.a: "Cash is always king."

nvn.56.t: "A Prosperous Paradise Under Chief Chee"
nvn.56.d: "Fighting for our independence and struggling to build a sovereign nation was never going to be an easy task, but under the brilliant leadership of High Chief, or Tʼáá Diné Binaatʼáanii, Henry Chee Dodge, we have begun to build a paradise for the People. Under the paternalist populism of the Chief and with the aid of his allies in the Business Council, egalitarian economic prosperity and profit has been brought to all within our nation. Though Navajo culture is dominant, all tribes and First Peoples are welcome within our union, for Chee Dodge cares for all true sons and daughters of the People. As the Great Interpreter and our beloved Tʼáá Diné Binaatʼáanii builds up the nation, and his own hereditary dynasty, all shall rejoice as this economic miracle continues here in Dinétah. Now, let us hope that he and his family can continue to bring these riches and successes to our people for many more generations to come as we build a profitable, prosperous Capitalist chiefdom here in the Southwest."
nvn.56.a: "Time is money, and cash is Chief."

nvn.57.t: "The Party for Indigenous Unity Wins Out"
nvn.57.d: "Taking control of our new democracy alongside President Ira Hayes, the Party for Indigenous Unity is prepared to guide our new tribal union towards Social Populism, pan-tribalism, and Progressivism while keeping in touch with our indigenous culture. Headed by Hayes himself along with the Ute chiefs Antonio Buck Sr. and Julius N. Cloud, Zuni chief Lutakawi, fellow Pima activist Jay R. Morago, and many others, the PIU will work with President Hayes in order to bring about a progressivist renaissance within this new multi-cultural union. Though the party is dominated and led by the Pima and Puebloans, the party has begun to swell to include Liberals, Progressives, Traditionalists seeking pan-tribalism, and other reformists from throughout the nation, becoming the main democratic entity in the state, and ensuring its electoral success for years to come. Let us hope that the PIU and Hayes can truly bring about the vaguely Socialist promises they have campaigned on."
nvn.57.a: "Forward for Progressivism and Unity."

nvn.58.t: "The American Indian Liberation Party Wins Out"
nvn.58.d: "Taking control of our new democracy alongside President Ira Hayes, the American Indian Liberation Party is prepared to guide our new tribal union towards Liberal reform, ecological sanctity, and agricultural expansion while keeping in touch with our indigenous culture. Headed by Hopi elders and leaders including Dan Evehema, Thomas Banyacya, David Monongye, and Dan Katchongva, the AILP will work with President Hayes in order to bring about an agrarian and Liberal renaissance within this new multi-cultural union. Though the party is dominated and led by the Hopi, the party has begun to swell to include agrarians, Liberals, ecologically conscious figures, and other reformists from throughout the nation, becoming the main democratic entity in the state, and ensuring its electoral success for years to come. Let us hope that the Liberation Party and Hayes can truly bring about the Agrarian and Liberal promises they have campaigned on."
nvn.58.a: "Forward for Liberal reform."

nvn.59.t: "The Navajo Business Council Leads Democracy with Hayes"
nvn.59.d: "Taking control of our new democracy alongside President Ira Hayes, the Navajo Business Council is prepared to guide our new tribal union towards Capitalist innovation, modernist prosperity, and Western-style liberal conservative reform while keeping in touch with our indigenous culture. Headed by Thomas Dodge, son of former Chairman and national hero Henry Chee Dodge, alongside his sister Annie and Councilmembers like Marchus Kanuho, Deshna Clah Cheschillige, and Henry Taliman, the NBC will work with President Hayes in order to bring about a profitable renaissance within this new multi-cultural union. Though the party is dominated and led by the Navajo, the party has begun to swell to include Capitalists, liberal conservatives, and modernists from throughout the nation, becoming the main democratic entity in the state, and ensuring its electoral success for years to come. Let us hope that the Business Council and Hayes can truly bring about the economic miracle they have campaigned on."
nvn.59.a: "Forward for prosperity and modernity."

nvn.60.t: "The Native American Front for Traditionalist Preservation Wins Out"
nvn.60.d: "Taking control of our new democracy alongside President Ira Hayes, the Native American Front for Traditionalist Preservation is prepared to guide our new tribal union back towards the conservative culture and traditionalist practices of our ancestors. Headed by Robert Gernonimo, son of the famous Apache medicine man and tribal leader Geronimo, alongside Apache leaders Chato and Naiche, the NAFTP will work with President Hayes in order to bring about a traditionalist renaissance within this new multi-cultural union. Though the party is dominated and led by the Apache, the party has begun to swell to include traditionalists and conservatives from throughout the nation, becoming the main democratic entity in the state, and ensuring its electoral success for years to come. Let us hope that the NAFTP and Hayes can truly bring about the populist and traditionalist revival they have campaigned on."
nvn.60.a: "Forward for tradition and the culture."

nvn.61.t: "Healing the Yaqui"
nvn.61.d: "The Yaqui, also called the Hiaki or the Yoeme, are our fellow Uto-Aztekans, and have finally been brought within the fold. Only one of the populations of the Yaqui in the United States - the Pascua Yaqui of Tucson, Arizona - were accepted by the failed Federal government, with the Americans ignoring the Yaqui of California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Texas, Nebraska, and the southern range of Arizona. Furthermore, the Yaqui live largely across Northern Mexico, such as in Sonora, Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, and Jalisco, with a splinter population living in Yucatan. During the Mexican Revolution, the Yaqui tried to fight for better rights and higher standards of living, coming under fire from multiple sides in that terrible conflict. With the Yaqui finally free, we shall move to repair the damage the Mexicans did on them during their Revolution, uplift and modernize their reservations long neglected by the Americans, and set the standard of how we treat all new tribes and First Peoples who come under our banner as we march further South, such as our Uto-Aztek brethren like the Cora, the Huichol, the Nahuas, the Numic, the Hopi and more, along with all the other indiegnous peoples of Meso-America. All shall come to embrace this paradise!"
nvn.61.a: "All of Mexico’s First Peoples shall be embraced in this growing paradise."

nvn.62.t: "Establishing the First Navajo Hereditary Line" 
nvn.62.d: "Traditionally a matrilineal culture that only developed into our modern vaguely-patriarchal chiefdom due to the outside pressures of the Americans and their incessant and offensive need to have a executive male to negotiate with, the Navajo Nation has slowly become a true hereditary system since Chee Dodge’s ascension to being the first Chief and hereditary executive of the Navajo. However, with his death, a successor must be chosen, and it is here that the new debate has arisen. The government is divided over whether to follow matrilineal lines of our old traditions, nominating Chee Dodge’s daughter Annie Dodge Wauneka as the new Chief, or if we should follow this new patrilineal lifestyle imposed upon us by the American oppressors, instead moving to nominate Chee’s son Thomas Dodge. Both choices have their merits, but most traditionalists and anti-Americanists favor Annie while most modernists and Americanists favor Thomas. Who shall we choose?"
nvn.62.a: "Yield to traditional maternalism and crown Annie Dodge."
nvn.62.b: "Yield to modern Americanism and crown Thomas Dodge."

nvn.63.t: "Tribal Modernism and Capitalism Clique Leadership Elections" 
nvn.63.d: "With the victory of the Navajo-dominated capitalist councilism clique in the recent elections, our coalition of Southwestern tribes united in pursuit of modernist prosperity has seized the people’s mandate to bring profit and progress to our united people. Now, all we have to decide is who shall lead us. The main face of the group is Henry Chee Dodge, first chief of the Navajo thanks to the meddling of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and wise councilman who united our peoples against American pressure and exploitation of our mineral, farming, ranching, and water rights. However, Chee Dodge has grown old, and so it is up to his children Annie and Thomas Dodge to lead the way in his stead. Most traditionalists and anti-Americanists within our nation support Annie’s bid for the seat in looming elections, citing our matrilineal traditions supported by Annie’s right-hand woman Lilakai Julian Neil - the first woman ever to be elected into the Navajo Tribal Council. However, most modernists and those who bend to a fusion of Navajo-Americanist idealism support Thomas Dodge, shying away from matrilineal tradition in order to create a more ‘Western’ Navajo Nation. With the votes now being counted, it surely is anyone’s race."
nvn.63.a: "In a win for Navajo traditionalism, Annie Dodge and Lilakai Julian Neil are elected." 
nvn.63.b: "In a win for Americanist modernism, Thomas Dodge wins the race." 
nvn.63.c: "The people rally around wise, old Chee Dodge despite his protests and wishes to retire." 

nvn.64.t: "Progressive Tribal Unity Clique Leadership Elections" 
nvn.64.d: "With the victory of Hayes’ pan-tribal unity clique in the recent elections, our diverse coalition of minor Southwestern tribes united in pursuit of progressive reform has seized the people’s mandate to bring real societal change to our united people. Now, all we have to decide is who shall lead us. The main candidates are split between their main tribes and ethnic groups. Hayes himself and his ally Jay R. Morago lead the dominant progressive Pima unity clique, while Governor Lutakawi and his Zuni social spiritualists, Chief Julius N. Cloud and his Zuni liberals, and Anselmo Valencia Tori and his Yaqui pseudo-Socialists each dominate their own region and political field, and each stands a good chance against the heroic Hayes. With elections within the party being fierce, it is anyone’s race"
nvn.64.a: "Hayes and his progressive Pima group win out."
nvn.64.b: "Lutakawi and the social spiritualist Zuni dominate."
nvn.64.c: "Julius N. Cloud and his liberal Zuni win a victory."
nvn.64.e: "Anselmo Valencia Tori and the pseudo-Socialist Yaqui seize the day."

nvn.65.t: "Tribal Traditionalism Clique Leadership Elections" 
nvn.65.d: "With the victory of the Apache-dominated tribal traditionalism and conservatism clique in the recent elections, our coalition of Southwestern tribes united in pursuit of traditionalist reverence has seized the people’s mandate to bring measured progress and limited reform to our united people. Now, all we have to decide is who shall lead us. The two main Apache leaders that dominate the party are Naiche and Chato. Chato is a Chiricahua Apache subchief and skilled raider who has led our nascent military to great effect since our fight for independence, gaining veterancy during his time leading raids against the Arizonan settlers in the late 1800s, and has rallied much of the young guard to his side despite his advanced age. Naiche, on the other hand, is one of the last hereditary Chiricahua Apache chiefs, and has become famous across the nation for his diplomatic skill and experience as a leading statesman and executive, rallying much of the old guard around his skill. With elections within the party being fierce, it is anyone’s race."
nvn.65.a: "The skilled statesman Naiche rises to lead the party."
nvn.65.b: "Chato, the veteran raider and military leader, wins the day."

nvn.66.t: "Internal Elections Within the Fire Council Coalition" 
nvn.66.d: "With the parties finally organized and the people ready to finally have their voices heard, the first elections of our new Tribal Union, including positions for the Tribal Council, the Grazing Committee, the Land Board, the School Board, the Farm Board, the Election Board, and many more governmental positions, are being held. Though Ira Hayes shall remain as President, these elections will determine who rules alongside him, and what general political plan we will follow going forward. With the progressive Social Democratic unity coalition of Hayes, backed by the Pima, Ute, Zuni, and other Puebloans, and the Capitalist moguls of the Navajo Business Council being the main two parties in the running, many prepare for one of these two groups to win out. However, none should discount the rising tide of the Hopi liberals or the Apache conservatives, for both groups still stand a good chance at victory in this split field, and with our recent acquisition of Texas, the local unionist and Comanche-Mexican socialist Emma Tenayucca seeks to bring native-minded Leftism to the Southwest Indians. Let the votes be counted!"
nvn.66.a: "The progressive unity coalition headed by the Pima, Ute, and Zuni wins out."
nvn.66.b: "The Hopi liberals shall guide the state strong and true."
nvn.66.c: "Go with the cautious capitalists at the Navajo Business Council."
nvn.66.e: "Align with the Apache conservatives and traditionalists."
nvn.66.f: "The darkhorse Emma Tenayuca and her Leftist Comanche group wins out."

nvn.67.t: "Honoring Tewanima"
nvn.67.d: "Long-distance runner and Olympic silver medalist Louis Tsökahovi Tewanima has announced the creation of the Second Mesa Athletic Gymnasium in his home town at Shungopavi, Arizona. A member of the Hopi tribe, Tewanima became famous for winning the silver medal in the 10,000 meter run at the 1912 Olympic. After the olympiad, he settled down as a sheep herder and farmer, and even volunteered in our fight for freedom, but with the advent of our sovereignty, he has moved to share his expertise with our newly independent peoples. Opening his academy to aspiring athletes and olympians, Tewanima is sure to train the next generation of Indigneous athletic superstars. Who knows, maybe with his guidance, an Amerindian will finally take home the Gold."
nvn.67.a: "A great showing of Amerindian fitness."

nvn.68.t: "The Red Chieftess of Uto-Aztek Comancheria"
nvn.68.d: "As the newcomers into our federation, the Comanche and other indigenous peoples of Texas have slowly but surely been integrating themselves into their new national structure, albeit with some minor growing pains and hiccups. However, the worst has been avoided by Councilwoman and President Emma Tenayuca. A Mexican-Comanche unionist, Socialist activist, and egalitarian progressive focused on labor and societal equality and reform, Tenayuca has worked hard to make life equal, fair, and prosperous for all within our borders - even the divisive White population. However, she has begun to be influenced by a new movement from that South that has latched itself onto our united Uto-Aztek identity. /n/nFounded by the likes of Frida Kahlo, Gerardo Murillo Cornado, and Diego Rivera, this so-called ‘Mexicayotl’ movement seeks to unite Mesoamerican indigenous cultures with modern ideas of Socialism and patriotism to form an Aztek-influenced democratic socialist republic in Mexico. With the main pillars of this Mexicayotl movement already resonating with many of Tenayuca’s policies and ideas while also meshing well with our new Uto-Aztek/Comanche syncretic identity, perhaps we could incorporate more of their ideas into the fold for the betterment of all Southwestern tribes."
nvn.68.a: "Stick with Tribal Communitarianism and Unionism."
nvn.68.b: "Drift towards the Mexicayotl ideal." 
nvn.68.c: "Drift to the Mexicayotl ideal and ally with Kahlo’s revolutionary Aztek state."

nvn.70.t: "Post-Chee Navajo Elections" 
nvn.70.d: "With the sudden passing of Councilman and executive Chee Dodge, the Navajo Tribal Council is without a leader. Although there are many members that could rise to take the late Chee’s position, two above all are favored by most - these being Chee’s own children Thomas and Annie Dodge. Most traditionalists and anti-Americanists within our nation support Annie’s bid for the seat in looming elections, citing our matrilineal traditions supported by Annie’s right-hand woman Lilakai Julian Neil - the first woman ever to be elected into the Navajo Tribal Council.

nvn.71.t: "The Death of Mister Interpreter" 
nvn.71.d: "Passing away in his sleep peacefully due to complications from a recent bout of pneumonia, Henry Chee Dodge has passed away at the age of 87. Known as Hastiin Adiits’a’ii (Mister Interpreter) and Kiilchii’ (Red Boy), Chee Dodge was one of the most widely-respected figures in our tribal union. A master negotiator who saved our people time and time again from the greedy predations of the White Man upon our mineral and water rights as well as a sound leader, wise historian, brave freedom fighter, and so much more, Chee Dodge has served our peoples well for decades, earning his final rest more than most. \n\nIn accordance with Navajo traditions, Chee was buried far away from the living areas on a pristine plot near his hometown of Fort Defiance, laid to rest with the tools used to bury him, as is tradition, along with his closest personal possessions, including his signature hat. Selected mourners and his family bathed and dressed his body in the customary garments before the final ceremony, then worked quietly to finally give Chee Dodge his final peace. In the wake of his death, we shall continue to further his life’s work of freeing the people of the Southwest while bringing prosperity and freedom to the Peoples."

Fighting tooth and nail for our true and full sovereignty, we have finally come out on top. After four wars against four different waves of colonizers and imperialists, we have finally won our freedom. Now, onwards to our brighter future as we endeavor to build a truly free Indigenous state here in the American Southwest."

Though controversial, all the tribes of our Southwestern Unity Pact and not just the Navajo shall be called to this meeting, for the decisions made here will affect all within this new state. We shall decide on the future of our nation and the People before we embark on our new destiny."

We now move to officialize our national status in the eyes of both our own people and the wider international community. We shall build state offices and bureaus, organize a working modern state, and get the international recognition of the wider powers of the globe.

NVN_clan_govemrment_desc: "The Navajo, and to a lesser extent our allied tribes, have a society highly centered around family units, or clans. In the case of the Navajo, they are also matriarchal in nature, with the bloodline of the female parent taking precedence over all else. Keeping with tradition and seeking to build a modern state that embodies our own cultures and not just some shallow facsimile of failed Americanism, we shall move to incorporate these matrilineal clans and other tribal structures and hierarchies into the organizational framework of this new state. These clans shall hold the political power and influence they always have, but now in a modern and officialized framework backed by law."

We shall never forget this legacy, and move to build a society that treats all sexes and identities as equal akin to what many Westerners would call ‘feminism’. Though our generals, warriors, chiefs, and chairmen may often be men, our mothers and grandmothers shall always have the most final and most respected say."

Once declared chief by the Americans despite the matrilineal Navajo having no concept of the position, then chairman of the Business Council, and now Tribal Chairmen of the Tribal Council, Chee Dodge stands as the most powerful and most respected man in our infantile state.

Though this title was fabricated by the defunct Bureau of Indian Affairs, Chee has found it fitting of our new reality, and shall move to create a hereditary chiefdom under himself and his family, particularly his children Thomas and Annie Dodge, along with his highly respected wives. Embracing still-developing ideas of Navajo nationalism and American-influenced protectionist Capitalism married with a staunch reverence for Navajo traditions, we will build the first true Chiefdom of the Southwest form-fit for the Navajo people."

Furthermore, inter-council parties will be allowed to organize and campaign to the people, creating a functioning representative democracy open to all peoples within our union.

NVN_hayes_equiliaty_desc: "Moving to prove our union is more than just a flashy name, Ira Hayes and his administration have moved to make each and every tribe within our union equal. From the Hopi and Apache to the Pima and Zuni, including our friends the Puebloans, the Yaqui, and the Ute, and never forgetting the Navajo or any other tribe that is within our union now or comes to be within our union in the future, all tribes and all indigenous peoples of the Americas shall always be seen as distinct equals. We will never muddy the individual identities of our constituent tribes, but all shall be seen as equal before the state and before the law, all shall be voting citizens with full and protected rights, and all shall be equally represented with no favoritism given to any one specific culture or identity. Together, we will build a new syncretic identity without losing touch with each one of our individual and distinct roots."

NVN_hayes_flag_rising: "Raise Our Flag High"
NVN_hayes_flag_rising_desc: "Ira Hayes become a household name within the Navajo Nation and among the united peoples of our independence revolt when he and his squad climbed to the top of the Governor’s Mansion in Prescott, Arizona and raised high the unique flag of his proposed tribal union. Emulating this bravery and militarist aptitude, the new Tribal Union shall militarize like never before, slowly becoming an army with a state. Mandatory service will be extended, benefits and pensions for service members shall be increased, and the military-industrial complex shall grow larger and more efficient as it becomes more closely linked to the Tribal Council under Commander and Chief Ira Hayes. Military excellence and perpetual readiness will be stressed as the state begins to put more and more funding towards our military and towards our industrial build-up. We will prepare for the inevitable day our enemies come knocking, or the day we decide to go knocking first."

NVN_hayes_republic: "Americanized Plural Republicanism"
NVN_hayes_republic_desc: "Taking our steps at humanizing the Council and bringing egalitarian humanism to all indigenous peoples in our union even further, President Ira Hayes has moved to organize full multi-party democracy within the Tribal Council. Expanding the number of councilmen greatly and setting it to grow with the steadily rising population, new parties shall be organized and act as special interest groups that represent the will of the people. Though it is likely these parties will be dominated by one tribe or another, and though Ira Hayes shall still rule as President regardless of which parties are elected to the Council, it is a great step on the road to true American-style Republican Democracy form-fit for the realities of the People."

NVN_hearts_and_minds: "Mend the Hearts and Minds of the People"
NVN_hearts_and_minds_desc: "For far too long have foul social diseases infected the People and driven us towards ruin. From alcoholism and drug abuse to crime and an unchecked mental health crisis, the social, societal, and mental ailments that afflict our masses only serve to damage our cultures, our lives, and our future. We must work to mend the hearts and minds of the People, creating new hospitals, rehabilitation clinics, mental health centers, community outreach programs, and more all under a free and fair healthcare plan paid for and monitored by the Tribal Council and Ira Hayes."

NVN_aztec_herritage: "Our Uto-Aztekan Heritage"
NVN_aztec_herritage_desc: "The ‘Uto-Azteks’, or ‘Uto-Nahuatl’, are a loose grouping of related indigenous languages of the American West, Mexico, and northern Central America. Including groups such as the Pima - the tribe Ira Hayes hails from - as well as the Shoshone, Numic, and Ute to the far North, the Comanche of Texas, and the various Nahua speakers ranging from the Opata and Yaqui of Northern Mexico to the true Nahuas that once ruled over the heart of Mesoamerica, this diverse group of peoples all share a similar language, along with variably shared amounts of customs and cultural traditions. Though outlandish and insane to some, we shall move to unite the lands of the so-called ‘Uto-Azteka’ in order to bring our paradise to our bloodkin."



NVN_let_cry: "Loose the Anaa'ji Cry"
NVN_let_cry_desc: "The Anaa’ji is one of the many distinct warcries unleashed before, during, and after battle by the warriors of the Navajo, and it has become the rallying cry of our new revolt. What is being called the Fourth Navajo War, or Fifth if you count our separate and recent war against the Mexicans and the civil conflict within our ranks that ensued as war, has sparked to life. Now, we move against the Arizonans united as one, uneasy but ready to face the coming storm as we attempt to secure true independence once and for all. Temporary mass militarization and mobilization shall commence as volunteers rush to join the ranks of our braves. We will fight the White Devil and strive for full sovereignty, or die a noble death trying!"

NVN_legacy_of_wars: "Remembering Popé's Rebellion"
NVN_legacy_of_wars_desc: "Popé's Rebellion, also called Popay’s Rebellion or the Pueblo Revolt, was an indigenous uprising in 1680 that involved nearly the entire population of the Pueblo people taking up arms and fighting back as one against the Spanish colonizers in present-day New Mexico. Against all odds, these outgunned natives killed over 400 Spaniards and drove the remaining 2,000 or so settlers from the region. We shall embody their courage, their guerilla tactics, and their determination to fight in the face of certain annihilation, and although the Spanish returned 12 years later to finally subjugate Popay and his people, we will not make the same mistakes this time."

NVN_master_of_southwest: "Masters of the Southwestern Deserts"
NVN_master_of_southwest_desc: "None have come to adapt better to the Southwestern deserts than we have. Masters of the Painted Desert and settlers of the Southwestern Mesas, we embody the arid expertise of the Pueblo, the Apache, and the other native tribes of this hostile and arid land. Like the stalking coyote, the poised rattlesnake, or the scuttling scorpion, we shall show all of our foes why they should truly fear the desert."

NVN_actual_legacy_of_war: "Legacy of the Navajo Wars"
NVN_actual_legacy_of_war_desc: "The Navajo Wars are the name given to our numerous struggles against the imperialist Europeans. From the Spanish and later the Mexicans, to the Americans and now the Arizonans, each time our foes have tried to snuff us from existence, and each time, we have endured. We will embrace this brave and inspiring legacy as we face the circling imperialist wolves at the gates of hell."

NVN_codetalkers: "Establish the Code Talkers"
NVN_codetalkers_desc: "The Code Talkers program has been suggested by one of the few non-indigenous Arizonans who stood by us in our revolt against Arizona, the missionary, anthropologist, and educator Philip Johnston, and our state will now move to put it into action. By encrypting all communications through a cipher using garbled forms of the local indigenous languages, we shall ensure that no one but our own people will be able to understand our comms."

NVN_fort_thing:0  "Fortify Fort Defiance"
NVN_fort_thing_desc: "Fort Defiance, called Tséhootsooí in the Navajo language, is a Navajo town within our borders that was built in the late 1860s and 1870s on the ruins of the old fort and town the Americans had built after establishing a military outpost there in 1851. Seeking to make good on the name, and due to its strategic location near the capital, we shall fortify the area once again, building our own fortifications and military base in the area to suit the needs of our growing armed forces."

NVN_refine_police: "Refine the Tribal Police"
NVN_refine_police_desc: "Once police chief of the Navajo Tribal Police himself, Chee Dodge has moved to reform the brotherhood he holds so dear into a true defense force for the new nation. Small, veteran, elite, and equipped with the absolute best gear we can muster, these boys in beige will defend the nation and uphold law and order without faltering and without failure."

NVN_milterize_police: "Militarize the Tribal Police"
NVN_milterize_police_desc: "Taking inspiration from his own background in the military as well as from his American counterparts he has personally faced on the frontline, Ira Hayes has moved to fully militarize the Tribal Police, opening enrollment to all tribal members, both of any gender and any tribe. Furthermore, this new fully-fledged army shall be expanded and further supplied by the growing military-industrial complex, ensuring we always have the troops and arms we need to take on any opponent."

NVN_coopt_america: "Co-Opt American Military Installations"
NVN_coopt_america_desc: "All across our lands, the Americans, Mexicans, and Arizonans have all left behind valuable military hardware, equipment, armaments, installations, industrial centers, caches, stockpiles, warehouse and more, all just waiting to be plundered and but to better use. We will take in or take over all they left behind, and use it as the foundation for our new military industry and network."

NVN_nuclear_navajo: "Camp Navajo Nuclear Tests"
NVN_nuclear_navajo_desc: "Camp Navajo was the name given by Americans to a local uranium mine and covert nuclear research center that was investigating the applications of nuclear science, particularly fission, in the fields of weaponry and energy production. Though the Americans did not get very far with their studies before their fall and the arrival of the Mexicans - the coming of which prompted them to seal many of the facilities beneath the mountains - there is still a viable framework here that we can build on. Perhaps, with a lot of time, effort, and good science, we could unlock the secrets of what they were trying to achieve here."

NVN_apache_scouts: "Recommission the Apache Scouts"
NVN_apache_scouts_desc: "The Apache Scouts were first created in the 1860s during the Apache Wars, and were composed of Apache turncoats who aided the Americans in the fight against their brethren in hopes of getting a better deal for their tribes as a whole, and who specialized in guerilla warfare, espionage, diplomacy, wilderness survival, and special forces-style combat. Further serving with the Americans in wars against the Navajo, the Yavapai, and the Mexicans, the Apache Scouts have a hard history to come to terms with, but their success and skill is undeniable. Many of the old veterans of this order are still around, so we shall move to pardon them of any wrongdoing and commission them to train a new generation of Apache Scouts."

NVN_no_long_walk: "Never Another Long Walk!"
NVN_no_long_walk_desc: "The Long Walk - our banishment and near-total extinction wrought by the Ameicans - has finally been undone, for our new nation stands proud, strong, and free. We shall ensure that genocide never again comes to harm our people, and we shall ensure that our nation is always ready for our eternal foe. Our union will always be on guard, keeping at the forefront of military tactics, strategies, technologies, and more in order to ensure we are never forced to choose between subjugation or annihilation ever again."



NVN_new_deal: "A New Deal for the New Nation"
NVN_new_deal_desc: "Previous American Presidents often flaunted ideas of a ‘New Deal’ for the American Indians, stating hollow promises of recognition, reparation, and recompensation along with full rights, respected autonomy, land givebacks, and so much more. However, this so-called New Deal never came, so it is up to ourselves to bring about such a miracle. We shall move to reform the industrial and socioeconomic foundation of this new nation so that we can make good on the centuries of broken promises."

NVN_modern_trad_eco: "Modern Economics Tied to Our Roots"
NVN_modern_trad_eco_desc: "As we pursue a modern economy linked with the wider global financial system, we must never lose touch with the traditions, crafts, industries, and practices that we have survived on for centuries. We will charge towards modernity and financial prosperity, but one foot shall always be rooted in the past."

NVN_expand_council: "Economic Expansion Under the Business Council"
NVN_expand_council_desc: "The Navajo Business Council has risen to become the chief economic authority in the nation, running a semi-planned economy with great degrees of privatization and small business growth beneath it. The Business Council will be granted additional funding and authority in dictating the economic direction of the nation. Under their guidance, our financial system will bloom like never before."

NVN_markets: "Break Free into Foreign Markets"
NVN_markets_desc: "No longer under the economic determination and domination of the Americans or the Mexicans, we are finally free to pursue our own economic agenda. By establishing new trade routes and contracts with foreign markets and investors while waving around enticing investment opportunities, we shall ensure the capital flows from foreign hands and into our pockets."

NVN_tribal_goods: "Commodify Tribal Goods"
NVN_tribal_goods_desc: "We will make the unique handicrafts and artistic creations of our people hot commodities in foreign markets, advertising and commercializing our unique cultures and identity for profit. Though it is not the most moral thing to do, there is no denying the amount of profit there is to be made in selling native trinkets to all-consuming foreigners."

NVN_american_capitalism: "Perfect the American Ideal of Capitalism"
NVN_american_capitalism_desc: "Capitalism was once a foreign concept to the People, but now we have come to embrace it fully as if we invented it ourselves. Our union hums along as a capitalist paradise brought on by the investment and spending of our people. We shall continue to make perfect the American ideal of Capitalism, and beat the old imperialist bastards at their own game."

NVN_herds: "Reestablish the Herds"
NVN_herds_desc: "The Americans long restricted our right to maintain our centuries-long tradition of cattle rearing and ranching, fearing we would outcompete American farmers in sales or in available grazing land as our herds grew large and fat. With the Americans no longer an obstacle, we shall reestablish the great cattle herds, breathing life back into the ranching, meat, and dairy industries that once was the lifeblood of our economy."

NVN_crafts: "Expand Clan Crafts Industry"
NVN_crafts_desc: "The Navajo, Pima, and other local tribes have long been famous for their handicrafts expertise. Famous weavers, carpet and blanket makers, jewelry crafters, silversmiths, and masters of basketry, these traditional crafts will always have a place in our economy. We shall expand production of these goods and ship them to overseas markets, capitalizing on the Western craze over native-prouced goods and foreign-looking art."

NVN_ranching: "Sustainable Ranching"
NVN_ranching_desc: "Though our herds are beginning to grow massive once again, we cannot make the same mistakes of the past. Our success at ranching once proved to be too great, our mastery too perfect, for our herds began to overeat their way into starvation as they stripped the grasslands bare with their unending appetites. As we grow the herds once again and continue to grow our agricultural sector, we must be mindful of the environment around us to ensure we can keep these practices up indefinitely."

NVN_ag_rev: "Mechanized Agricultural Revolution"
NVN_ag_rev_desc: "Utilizing modern and mechanized tractors, tillers, plows, and other agricultural equipment from our foreign trading partners, we shall bring about a new agricultural revolution here in our infantile state. Everything from the ranches and the crop fields to the slaughterhouses and processing plants shall become powered by machinery, at least in part, easing the workload of our workers, increasing output and productivity, lowering chances of injury or strain, and improving the agricultural sector as a whole."

NVN_nationalize: "Nationalize the Riches of the Earth"
NVN_nationalize_desc: "Going in line with the recommendation of Ira Hayes, we shall work to nationalize the mineral, water, and other land rights of the nation, putting these valuable and necessary resources in the hands of the government to administer and organize as they see fit.. This shall ensure that Capitalist greed does not get in the way of ensuring everyone is cared for, and that every piece of scrap or ore goes to benefit the wider nation."

NVN_sell_resources: "Capitalize on Our Mineral Wealth"
NVN_sell_resources_desc: "Heeding the words of Chee Dodge, we shall move to privatize the mineral, water, and other land rights of the nation, allowing private citizens and small businesses to purchase access to these resources in order to sell them to the masses. Though the government shall always ensure an equal playing field with no foul play, the economy will be at the whims of Capitalism and in the hands of those that can afford it."

NVN_trad_industiralization: "Traditionalist Industrialization"
NVN_trad_industiralization_desc: "Industrialization does not have to mean a total divorcal from traditional ways of living. We shall always maintain our cultures, our identities, and our unique ways of life no matter how large our factories grow. Industrialization is key, and shall be pursued swiftly, but not at all costs. The environment around us, the land we hold dear, the people we care for, and our duty to tradition shall all always come first."

NVN_mircle: "A Miracle in Dinétah"
NVN_mircle_desc: "With the New Deal working like none could have ever had hoped, an economic miracle has been created here in Dinétah. The economy hums along like a well-oiled machine, the land remains pure, and the people rejoice, living higher-quality and healthier lives than ever before. We have embraced modernity without losing sight of what makes the People unique, and now all in our union benefit from it. Let us continue refining the system we have created here as we rocket towards our new prosperous destiny."

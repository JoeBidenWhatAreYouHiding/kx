POLITICS_WILLIAM_TUBMAN_FALLOUT_DESC:0 "Few men in Human history have had the weight of an entire civilization on their shoulders, and fewer still have had the ability to do anything to stop the inevitable collapse that comes for every empire, but William Tubman is no mere man - at least, not anymore.\n\nBorn long before this metaversal mess in another realm, William Vacanarat Shadrach Tubman served as President of Liberia, bringing liberty to his people on the Windward Coast as the Cold War and later Resource Wars began to tear the world apart. Hearing rumors of doomsday-devices being constructed by the world’s Superpowers and ever cautious of the ever-escalating war, President Tubman began to prepare for the worst. Amassing resources and technologies from all over the globe through his far-reaching connections, President Tubman plotted to save what he could of humanity as the clock ticked ever faster towards midnight. Creating networks of bunkers protected by a nation-spanning missile-defense system and powered by nuclear reactors, President Tubman labored hard to save his people, but as the ravages of stress, time, age, and radiation began to take effect on him, something drastic had to be done. Utilizing temperamental and experimental technology stolen from the American Southwest, this heroic madman transferred his own consciousness to a system of computers, digitizing himself and becoming bodiless but immortal. With endless time to prepare, Tubman was able to turn Liberia into a paradisiacal fortress before all hell let loose.\n\nOnce the final bell tolled and the bombs finally fell, nearly all life on Earth was eradicated within moments, and though even the mightiest nations fell before the sword, our Liberia stood strong! Due to President Tubman’s preparations, we were saved from this hellfire apocalypse, hidden away under vast underground vaults and sheltered behind the most sophisticated defense system ever built. In the new wasteland, Liberia prospered for many decades, but now all that has changed. After being transferred through time and space by God knows what, this ‘Mr. Tubman’ as his AI form calls himself is unsure of what to make of this new reality, but is still as hell-bent as ever to secure liberty for Liberia and its people at all cost."
POLITICS_ZAPATA_AI_DESC:0 "Emiliano Zapata - the fourth and final son of Tlaloc - has taken to the ideals of his human counterpart fiercely: seeking to eradicate inequality and poverty §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata, freedom fighter of the Mexican Revolution, was a leading figure in the conflict. He fought against the corrupt regime of Porfirio Díaz until he was killed in an ambush in April 1919. After his death, Zapatista generals aligned with §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nFollowing the Mexican Revolution and after three back-to-back PLM presidents, Zapata broke their political monopoly and achieved victory in Mexico's 1932 Presidential election with his PNA. Since taking office, he has promoted the development of Mexico's collective farms, 'Ejidos', and through economic incentives and with Mexican oil on offer, has fostered close diplomatic ties with the Third Internationale. However, his vaguely Socialist stances and deeply Socialist allies have angered many §RSYSTEM ERROR, Rebooting...§!\nEmiliano Zapata is the ultimate culmination of humanity’s hubris. A god of saturnite, plasma and human ingenuity built for only one purpose: the complete destruction of Capitalism as a conceptual idea. Zapata will bring about his agrarian-socialist utopia, even if he has to kill every last capitalist in the wasteland to do it."
POLITICS_TLAOC_DESC:0 "Unknowable, alien, and alone: Tlaloc gazes at the surface through cold, dead lenses. Its miles of circuitry and constituent components have been restored, revitalized by the temporal rift that ripped it from its own timeline and threw it into this alien reality. Built by the brightest minds Liberia had to offer, with technology none of them fully understood, the undisputed new God of the Yucatan looms over all aspects of daily life like a spectre. It has killed by the thousands, and it will kill again. In these new days, now freed of the decay that once ate at its mechanical innards like a plague, it reflects on its “life” and accomplishments, on the “children” it left behind and the one it has found again in this new world. Somewhere deep inside its central core, there is a sense of empathy, and now with a new shot at ‘life’, perhaps it can even come to comprehend what that means. Tlaloc now does not even know when exactly when it will die: and so it is free to act without reprehension, ever plotting and preparing to enact his final ambitions."

It seems however, that the people have had enough. Fueled by angry by the Government's lack of action, on top of the laundry list of other societal ills that plague us, it seems the camel's back has finally been broken. Everywhere from the ODP's stronghold in the South, the Longists of the Midwest or the Syndicalists in the Steel Belt and even the Great State of Texas, the people have had enough, and have begun to rise up against our rule.

Not only did they help Mr. Tubman source the materials and technologies needed to save New Monrovia and transfer himself to immortality, for they also build and maintain his vast army of Securitrons. The second and still likely option is to align with the Masons, composed of Mr. Tubman’s loyalists and close associates. They have their strengths as the ones who control the day to day operations of the Liberian government as Mr. Tubman deals with greater tasks, while also controlling the cities of New Monrovia, but there are rumors that they seek to one day usurp Tubman’s rule.\n\nThe third choice would be to align with the tribal secret society based in the Hinterlands called the Poro. The Poro, contrary to the tribal nature of its members, is highly organized as well as incredibly efficient and violent. They run all sorts of lucrative scams, sinful business, and even hire themselves out as hired guns, and being the largest group by far they have the numbers to back it up. Finally, the strange Leopard Society stands in the shadows. A secret society like the Masons and the Poro, the Leopard Society and their smaller partner gang the Crocodile Society are known cannibals and practitioners of witchcraft and sorcery, which has only been enhanced by the radiation of our olh homeland pre-Rift.

Meanwhile, the Paladins are the armored fist of the Brotherhood, being our main military force and chief officers within our military hierarchy. Nearly unkillable in their armor, especially when up against the outdated weapons of this timeline, these modern knights in shining Power Armor lay waste to our many foes as they swear to protect our Chapter and further scout for new technologies to recover.

However, with this land’s Khan, who goes by the strange name of Ungern, on his way back to the city, Papa Khan prepared his forces to hold our new home at all costs.\n\nIn a battle of horses and scrap-bikes, archers and gunners, members of both khanate fell before the steel and lead in droves before the bloody nightmare finally ended. Standing atop a pile of bodies from both dimensions, Papa Khan and Ungern could be seen dueling in a fierce melee. However, with one misstep on an outcropping of hacked arms and flesh, Ungern lost his footing and was quickly beheaded by the opportunistic Papa Khan. Raising the head of the false khan high above for all to see, Ungern’s surviving men dropped to their knees and swore fealty to the true khan.

Not reduced to near-mindless goons like Hoover’s earlier test subjects, the old general has been redubbed simply as Mac, and shall now serve as the head Lieutenant of the Master’s Armies.

With their resources and control over the Executive branch, the Master is able to continue to assemble more and more assets and personnel to the Unity, a new branch of the US Armed Forces. Still kept a secret to a majority of the American public, the Unity will be the strongest army in the world by being the absolute pinnacle of human evolution. The normals will stand no chance.

To help us with this conundrum, the Master has paid a visit to Father Charles Coughlin, a preacher who can be swayed to help us. After diplomatic talks, and some smashing, the Master and Mac had convinced Coughlin to be injected with the FEV, but misfortune struck as his weakling body rejected it. Eager to help us regardless, or desparate to save his own life, Coughlin adamantly spoke to the Master about how he could still be of service, to which the Master agreed. For where the FEV cannot reach, words can. Ideas are the strongest of weaponry. The Master bestowed the name of Morpheus on Coughlin, who would become the head of the Children of the Cathedral.

We will usher in a world free of normals and division. In the ashes, the Unity will reign supreme! For far too long, humanity has created division to stymie progress and propagate hate.

Though most would have predicted that such a move would have killed Tlaloc, it would seem that the opposite has become true, for the rapid decay that was causing Tlaloc's demise in the other world has now been entirely stopped, perhaps forever!

However, even a god needs help sometimes, and so Zapata deigned to do what his own father Tlaloc had done before him. Creating a new subroutine from his own processing power, he would create a copy of his favored meat puppet, but not out of the fetid and crude biomass that encumbered the real subject. This chosen specimen - the beacon of Totalism in the world Oswald Mosley - shall be saved from the unstoppable withering that befalls all lesser and base organic creatures, with his mind copied and transferred into a new temple of circuity and chrome.

Once again diverting some of his own processing power, Tlaloc created a new Zapata, but one free of the malformed code and endless bugs that plague the last one. Instead, this new Zapata was based off of this new Timeline's version of Zapata - the one who led the Mexican Revolution to glorious victory and who brought the Revolution to Tlaloc’s new people.

Not wishing to fight but to talk, this fellow AI, calling itself CALIX, approached Tlaloc with an offer of friendship and aid. Explaining that she had fallen through the Rift just as Tlaloc and Zapata, CALIX wished no harm to anyone, but believed that she could be of aid to the waking protector of Mexico. She went on to 'spill the beans' on Zapata and reveled that he too was creating sons, sons who would stand against Tlaloc and could perhaps overpower him. Thus, she offered her own aid, in exchange for not but a chunk of Tlaloc's server space, so she would no longer need to worry for her existence.

Thus this was the last time anybody heard of what was going on in Berlin officially, as the morning would be filled with chaos.\n\nDresden and other cities near Berlin were swamped by crowds of citizens fleeing from an apparent shock attack on Berlin, where the City center was suddenly swarmed with men dressed as old legionnaires of the Roman empire, and with pistol and sword they stormed the government quarters. The towns surrounding Berlin were equally struck in a rapid manner, thus preventing troops from perhaps saving the Kaiser as they themselves were suddenly attacked, and in towns such as Potsdam they’re continued resistance resulted in the town being razed.\n\nThus where the rest of Germany might have continued resistance, the rule of fear struck many down as while refugee’s consumed city efforts to prepare, messengers of this apparent ‘legion of caesar’ gave governors and princes of the remaining german territories ultimatums, bow to caesar or have your cities razed. And so many a brave men’s efforts to organize a resistance were given up as scared citizens mutinied against continued efforts and those troops that did march against Caesar were swarmed by his legionaries.

Nothing can get in the way of our king's lofty goals; progress and reclamation!"

SER_Encourage_Yugoslavism:0 "Encourage Yugoslavism"
SER_Encourage_Yugoslavism_desc:0 "Our king is a strong believer in the Pan-Slavic Yugoslav movement, believing the South Slavs all share a common cultural bond.

SER_Begin_Land_Reform:0 "Begin Land Reform"
SER_Begin_Land_Reform_desc:0 "Serbia is largely agrarian, with the vast majority of its population being rural farmers. King Alexander is eager to win over the people and cement himself as a modernizing leader, decreeing that all feudal estates over 100 cadastral yokes to be broken up and their owners compensated.

SER_Organise_The_Radical_Union_desc:0 "Formerly a People’s Radical, Prime Minister Stojadinović has seen the weakness of free democracy time and time again.

SER_Mobilise_The_Greenshirts:0 "Mobilise the Greenshirts"
SER_Mobilise_The_Greenshirts_desc:0 "The Greenshirts are the moniker of the Radical Union's paramilitary organization.

SER_Free_The_Vojvodas_Prisoners_desc:0 "The Vojvoda had no qualms with imprisoning political opponents and dissidents and a number of democrats remain in jail under flimsy pretexts.

SER_Modernise_The_Engineering_Battalions_desc:0 "An unexpected result of our rapid re-armament following the Occupation has come to the surface.

### Events ###
serbia.0.t:0 "The Kingdom of Serbia"
serbia.0.d:0 "The assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand by a Serb nationalist in 1914 proved to be the catalyst that began the Weltkrieg. Despite expecting an easy campaign, Austrian forces only managed to occupy Serbia itself in late 1915, and because of the entrance of Bulgaria in the war. After the war Serbia's southern territories were handed over to Bulgaria, whilst the remainder was kept under Austrian occupation until 1926, when the Austrians were forced to withdraw their troops due to ethnic tensions elsewhere in the Empire, and war-hero Petar Bojović was appointed Regent.\n\nSince then Serbia has struggled to survive, keeping a low profile in light of the knowledge that she could not stand up to any sort of military attack. Over time the government has become increasingly jingoistic, and knowing that they could not hope to defeat Austria they have instead turned their attention southwards; towards Macedonia. Several diplomatic talks have already been conducted with the revanchist Romanian and Greek governments with a view to undermining Bulgarian hegemony in the region, and some say talk of a formal alliance is not far off.\n\nMeanwhile, the Serbian throne has remained empty. Austria has threatened to intervene in the event of a Karađorđević restoration, and the Vojvoda has complied, blocking the former Crown Prince Alexander’s attempts at returning and alienating many Royalists in the process. With the regency slowly losing support, can Serbia successfully steer a course to triumph in the 'Bulgarian Matter'? And if so, can she finally defeat the old enemy Austria, and realise her dream of a pan-Slavic Union?"
serbia.0.a:0 "Serbia will be great again!"

serbia.1.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Serbia!"
serbia.1.d:0 "Ever since the end of the Weltkrieg, our economy has been a troubled one. The immense devastation left a huge void for us to fill; our industry was obliterated and a whole generation was lost to the horrors of war. Nonetheless we managed to partially recover and under Petar Bojović a stable, though weakened economy has been reconstructed, based primarily on the kind of lucrative agricultural exports that sustained us before the war.\n\nThe collapse of the German Stock Market has undone all of that hard work. The evaporation of the biggest markets for our produce is beginning to collapse our largest economic sector, and our lack of industrialisation has exposed the underlying weakness of the recent economic reforms. The only thing that has staved off a complete collapse as seen in Germany is Serbia's relative isolation, which has helped protect some key industries. Finance Minister, and vice-president of the flagging Belgrade Stock Exchange, Milan Stojadinović is preparing a series of austere emergency measures to stabilise the Dinar and get the economy back on track, which are expected to be approved by the Regent when they are ready."
serbia.1.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

serbia.2.t:0 "Austria Withdraws from the Border"
serbia.2.d:0 "Though the occupation ended in 1926, the threat of the Common Army has remained. Vienna has had an army posted along our border ever since the Pan-Slavic revolt diplomatically ended with the formation of Illyria. A nation disarmed, Serbia has had no choice but to keep quiet, not daring to provoke the wrath of the Habsburgs. But this threat might be changing...\n\nBlack Monday has clearly upset the balance of power within the Dual-Monarchy, since today the Austrian’s have begun withdrawing the bulk of their army from Serbia, like they did in Italy a few weeks ago. We don't yet know the full reasoning as to the withdrawal; have ethnic conflicts begun to flare up like they did in the 20’s, or is there something more sinister at play? Whatever the reason, it has left the Vojvoda breathing a little easier at night, knowing that Serbia’s fragile independence is that bit more secure."
serbia.2.a:0 "An opportunity, perhaps?"

serbia.3.t:0 "All Quiet on the Front"
serbia.3.d:0 "Last month, the slow Austrian withdrawal from the border left many stunned and confused, and the new arrangements appear to have remained. With the Habsburgs facing their comeuppance in the name of increased national unrest, they’ve left merely a skeleton crew guarding our borders. It is clear that their once ever-lasting watch over Belgrade has moved on, and we are finally free of Vienna’s yoke after twenty years of oppression!\n\nBut what do we do with this new-found freedom? Petar Bojović, our long-standing Regent and Vojvoda, has been asked a million questions and has few answers to give. He knows that Austria will likely be back, and in greater numbers, so our window of opportunity is small. That window has been shrunk further still by the impact of Black Monday, which has left us also weakened. He can't appear weak and ineffective in the face of this golden opportunity, and thus its expected Bojović will make political moves in the coming weeks, to cement Serbia’s independence."

But it's clear this isn't the case in the region of Montenegro, long dogged by pro-Serbian activity.\n\nOver the last couple of years, activity of the Serbian-Montenegrin unionist People’s Party has bolstered its numbers, despite our attempts to suppress the organisation. They oppose the Croat-dominated assembly of Illyria, and subsequently fight against a perceived lack of a voice in national affairs. In addition, they recently solidified control over their regional Parliament, making their actions that bit more irritating. We have no proof that suggests the recent uptick in unrest has been encouraged by the rump Serbian state, but they would surely attempt to capitalise on the unrest if it gets much worse."

serbia.5.t:0 "The Montenegrin Gambit"
serbia.5.d:0 "Montenegro has long been a region of Serbian interests, with an extensive population of Serbs and, importantly, a coast with a shipbuilding industry for naval affairs. In the Weltkrieg, Montenegro and Serbia fought side by side against the Habsburg hordes, and we shared that crushing loss. Montenegro has remained occupied by Vienna while we were able to secure our freedom, and is currently increasingly agitated within the Croat-dominated nation of Illyria; Even though autonomy has been given to Montenegro, the Montenegrin peoples see us as brothers, and there are running sympathies for a unification.\n\nToday, a cadre of politicians and military officials have met with Regent Bojović with a daring proposal. Their ultimate plan is a union between Montenegro and Serbia, done through political intrigue rather than military might, where the regional Parliament declares independence following a false-flag incident on Montenegrin citizens, before legally forming a union with Serbia. That way, an Austrian intervention would have little legitimacy, and the Habsburg Menace would have no choice but to watch it unfold. Many leading Montenegrin politicians are amicable to the idea, with the Serbian–Montenegrin unionist People’s Party long being dominant despite Illyrian and Austrian pressure.\n\nThe plan is no doubt extremely risky, but potentially very rewarding. The Vojvoda has promised to entertain the proposal, and has spoken with his trusted advisors about how realistic Austria not-interfering would be. They believe Kaiser Karl, for all of his many faults, would likely prefer a peaceful resolution to such a crisis than a bloody one, but it's not an absolute certainty. Bojović, as Regent, will have to make the final decision. Should we pursue this ‘Montenegrin Gambit’?"

serbia.6.t:0 "Chaos in Podgorica"
serbia.6.d:0 "It appears that the situation in Montenegro was a house of cards; all it required was a little push to fall apart completely. After the growing unrest in the region, our subtle intervention in further stoking anti-Vienna sentiment proved to be all we needed to put the plan into action.\n\nA few days ago, the apparent murder-suicide of a Serbian family and an Croat soldier with syndicalist sympathies sent Podgorica into chaos. The military in the area, blamed for the incident, had little effect on quelling protests, and eventually order broke down in the region's capital. Andrija Radović, the veteran leader of the People’s Party in Montenegro and subsequently the Montenegrin Parliament, declared Montenegro’s secession from the Illyrian union. A few hours later, another act would be brought in to create a formal South-Slavic union between Serbia and Montenegro, while the Illyrian army would be permitted safe passage out of the now Serbian lands. In just 6 hours, Montenegro had legally annexed itself into Serbia, uniting the two nations that had been apart for so long.\n\nOf course, we know the truth about the situation. It was not a Croat soldier who shot that family, but rather agents of one of the many Serbian secret societies that were inspired by the infamous Black Hand. In addition, the bills Radović passed were planned weeks ago, double-checked to be as legally watertight as possible. Unexpectedly, this course of events will likely bolster the support that moderate democratic parties, like the Democrats and Radicals, have within Serbia, likely further eroding the National Party’s control over the nation. But today is a cause for celebration, for our brothers have been liberated."

The military are, as expected, proposing a full mobilisation of our armies to deal with the Serbian problem once and for all. It's an alluring prospect; the Serbians are also weakened following Black Monday and according to intel reports, their army is heavily undermanned. However, the Kaiser is refusing to authorise such an operation, weary that another war could collapse the fragile system holding Austria and Hungary together. Instead, he has requested we issue a stern diplomatic complaint, while preparing an operation to break up the union once the Empire’s internal issues are resolved."

Today, he has received an answer, and thankfully for us, it's a positive one.\n\nKaiser Karl has sternly criticised the union, claiming Montenegro ‘has undermined the decade of investment and opportunity it has received under the Crown of Illyria’, however he has maintained his resolve for a peaceful resolution like we had speculated. Austria has, for now at least, given up their claim on Montenegro, and will not be conducting a military intervention into our lands. That being said, the telegram has made one threat, that being ‘Incidents against Croatian or Bosnian citizens within the Serbian-Montenegrin union will be seen as incidents against citizens of the Empire, and will be dealt with as such...'"

serbia.9.t:0 "Conspiracies Abound"
serbia.9.d:0 "For the last decade, Serbian politics has been more or less stable underneath the Vojvoda. The Yugoslavism and perceived royalism of the defeated People’s Radical Party was deemed too dangerous by the Austrians, so Bojović built his government on a new party, the conservative, centralist Serbian National Party, supported by the military establishment and various right-wing dissident groups. For the past 10 years, political repression and illiberal democracy have worked to consolidate the SNS, and subsequently Bojović’s control over the nation. But something had to ruin our carefully-built but slowly waning establishment, and that event was Black Monday.\n\nThough we’re on the road to recovery, many have lost faith in the National Party, even under the new, youthful leadership of former Mayor of Nis Dragisa Cvetkovic. On one side, the Democrats and Radicals have recouped some of the supporters that left them at the end of the Occupation, and are now presenting more cohesive opposition to Bojović’s. On the other hand, the presence of many secret, usually royalist, societies are a major concern over the Vojvoda's control over the armed forces. As rumours circle in Belgrade, it’s clear Petar Bojović’s hold over his nation has never been weaker."

serbia.10.t:0 "Founding of the SKK"
serbia.10.d:0 "Leading Intellectuals in Serbia are typically liberals, subscribing to either the Radicals or the Democrats. As such, they’re one of the biggest and most consistent forms of opposition to the National Party, and being some of the most influential men in the country their voices carry weight. With the short and increasingly tepid Prime Ministerial tenure of the inexperienced Dragisa Cvetkovic impacting the Regents authority within the National Assembly, these powerplayers have more power over Serbia than ever.\n\nToday, a group of seventy intellectuals met in Belgrade, founding the ‘Nacionalni kulturni klub’ (Serbian Culture Club). Among the men were professors Slobodan Jovanović and Pavle Popović, leading Democratic Party politician Milan Grol, and a slew of other lawyers, writers and academics. The group’s motto, ‘A strong Serbian identity, a strong Serbian nation’ summaries their nationalist views, but belies their committment to liberalism, which inform their negative opinions on the current rather authoritarian constitution. The most important aspect to come out from the meeting is their explicit leaning to republicanism, if from a pragmatic viewpoint than an ideological one; they believe that Serbia cannot remain a regency forever, and if it is to thrive then a free, liberal and democratic republic must replace it."

serbia.11.t:0 "Živković Requests the Crown Prince's Return"
serbia.11.d:0 "General Petar Živković is one of Serbia’s most prominent Karađorđević loyalists, a political position that’s seen him repeatedly sidelined by Petar Bojović. Suspected to be the leader of the shadowy, royalist ‘White Hand’ secret society, it wasn't a surprise when Živković approached the Vojvoda requesting that Crown Prince Alexander, son of Petar I and heir to the Serbian throne, be allowed to return from his prolonged exile in Switzerland. If Alexander were to return, it’d no doubt result in an almost immediate restoration; the war hero Crown Prince is still a popular figure across the country, despite the concerted Austrian effort to scrub the nation clean of the Karađorđević legacy during the occupation.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Živković has requested Alexander’s return. In 1931, during the Creditanstalt crisis in Austria, Živković made a similar request hoping to capitalise on the Habsburg’s distraction and formally restore the monarchy. Though Bojović denied the request back then, Serbia finds itself in a much more independent position following Black Monday. A Karađorđević restoration would no doubt draw the ire of Austria, but they won't be in a position to intervene and it’d be a nationally popular move. That being said, the Regency has been a stable time for Serbian politics, and restoring Alexander would likely be a destabilising move, compounded by his own fondness for autocracy which would no doubt result in a total political overhaul. In addition, Alexander has a marked fondness for Yugoslavism, another thing that could endanger the Serbian people. The Regent has an important choice to make. Should Alexander be allowed to return after 20 years of exile, or will the Regency continue?"

serbia.12.d:0 "When Crown Prince Alexander returned to Serbia a couple days ago, it was cause for national celebration. The streets were lined by thousands all hailing the return of the Crown Prince, flags flying in the air and patriotic songs being sung by the crowds. The people of Belgrade have certainly not forgotten their loyalty to the House of Karađorđević. After such a prominent national celebration, Petar Bojović only had one option open to him. With elaborate plans already drafted up by the now Prime Minister Živković, today they were put into action. After a ceremony that lasted several hours, Alexander was formally crowned as the new King of Serbia, finally sitting in the throne that had remained empty for over a decade. Bojović formally enshrined the new king with the temporal power he had wielded as Regent, and the ageing Vojvoda then announced his retirement from both political and military affairs.\n\nInternationally the response was mixed. As expected, we’ve received nothing but outrage from the Austrian Embassy for the last few days, though it would appear the Habsburgs aren't going to try and mobilise against us for the restoration. In more positive news, we’ve received large congratulations from King Carol II of Romania, a friend of the new king, which will no doubt help promote Balkan Unity in the years to come."

Be it the widespread presence of secret societies like the ‘White Hand’, or just the usual opportunism of the General Staff, Bojović is more than aware of the enemies he has within the Army.\n\nBut now, with his rejection of General Živković's proposal of a Karađorđević restoration, rumours are afoot. According to a group of minor officers who reported to the Vojvoda yesterday, a group of officers and soldiers alike are organising a royalist putsch against Bojović, with the clear intent of overthrowing the Regent and restoring Crown Prince Alexander to the Serbian throne. Bojović has kept quiet on the information, hoping to draw his enemies out into the open where they can hopefully be dealt with in due course. That is, if these rumours are true in the first place, as the Vojvoda has heard many similar claims in the over the years..."

serbia.14.t:0 "The March on Belgrade"
serbia.14.d:0 "It appears that not only were the rumours of General Petar Živković organising a putsch against Vojvoda Petar Bojović true, but actually grossly underestimated the situation. Today, Belgrade awoke to the sound of gunfire as a brigade led by Živković marched in, locking down the city and surrounding the National Assembly, taking Bojović and the members of the National Assembly hostage.\n\nPetar Živković gave his two demands; ending the exile of the House of Karađorđević and the appointment of him as Prime Minister. Technically, Živković isn't demanding Bojović’s resignation, but logically he’d strong-arm the restoration of Alexander within days, unceremoniously ousting the Regent. Bojović was able to put out a telegram request for military assistance before the phone-lines were cut, but it's unknown whether it was actually received.\n\nWith time ticking on the traitorous Živković’s ultimatum, Bojović needs to act. If he holds out, there’s a chance the royalists could storm the National Assembly, endangering the lives of hundreds of politicians and civilians. Kneeling to a traitor like Živković would be a disaster, but with no sign of help coming from units loyal to the Vojvoda it could be the only option."

Outnumbered 6 to 1, Živković’s coup attempt quickly collapsed, and after a night of sporadic fighting, the sun rose to Petar Bojović once again controlling the capital, with the traitors crushed and his authority bolstered. The traitorous ‘White Hand’ organisation, including Zivković who has been confirmed as the society's leader, have all been arrested and are awaiting trial, while Milutin Nedić is likely to receive the highest honours for his efforts in stemming the coup.\n\nThe political uncertainty gripping Serbia might not be over, but the royalist ideal has failed. The Vojvoda may have once been a staunch royalist, but the events of the last few weeks have decisively turned him against a restoration of the Karađorđević’s. "

Today, Slobodan Jovanovic, an esteemed intellectual & professor for over 30 years, as well as the leader of the liberal SKK society, had a lengthy meeting with Petar Bojović over his proposals for the future of Serbia.\n\nJovanovic’s proposal is one of radical reform, chiefly turning Serbia into a liberal republic with the veteran professor as its provisional president until elections can be held. Following the defeat of the royalist forces, there is an opening for a republican proclamation to actually succeed, however the Vojvoda is torn. After all, liberalising Serbia could leave it open to the syndicalist forces that Bojović’s National Party has tried to protect against. Then again, the political hole left in the National Party following the putsch has nearly collapsed its authority. A fresh start could be just what Serbia needs. After discussing with his aides over lunch, the Vojvoda met with Jovanovic to give his verdict on the republican proposal."

Waxing lyrical over the betrayal of the royalist forces a fortnight ago, he proclaimed that if Serbia were to be strong enough to reclaim her lost territories, then change would be needed. It was then when he passed over to Professor Slobodan Jovanovic.\n\nJovanovic announced he would be taking the helm as President of the new Serbian Republic, a fresh start for the unstable nation. A new constitution would be written, politically repressive laws would be overturned, and free elections would be held as soon as possible. In the meantime, a provisional, bi-partisan government under Jovanovic’s Nacionalni veće za demokratiju (National Council for Democracy) would oversee the transition to democracy. The new President did show respect for the Bojović regime, claiming that without the Vojvoda’s careful, pragmatic leadership in those early days of independence, Serbia could have easily been swallowed up by the Austrian menace. However, he claimed the time has come for the people to decide Serbia's path going forward.\n\nWith Bojović retiring from political and military life, the reins have been passed over to the optimistic Jovanovic. Whether he can bring peace and stability to his new republic remains to be seen."

In a short statement, the consortium of businessmen and corporation owners have claimed that recent crises have left the Serbian government powerless, and until a strong government is restored they’ll refuse to deal with the Regent’s government.\n\nThe royalist putsch might have been a serious threat, but this could end up being even more damaging. Prime Minister Dragisa Cvetkovic is on the verge of resignation, which could collapse the entire government. Some of Bojović’s aides have noted that following up on Jovanovic’s proposal would probably help remedy the situation, though others have told the Vojvoda to stand up to the industrialists, hoping the nation falls in line behind him."

Milan Stojadinovic has visionary ideas on reforming the ailing National Party to reassume control over the National Assembly. His plan is to reorganise the government into a mass-mobilised movement, the Radical Union coalition.

In addition, he has taken a populist move, one no doubt advised by the new Prime Minister, and praised the resilience and unity of the Serbian people in this time of ‘unprecedented crisis’.\n\nAs we’d hoped, the Industrialist ultimatum fell apart after it was clear Bojović’s regime had re-solidified, and many of the people calling for his retirement have gone back to begging for mercy.

Since the Weltkrieg, Bulgaria’s hegemony in the region has seen the VMRO go into a form of limbo, fading into history with their goal achieved.\n\nOur recent reclamation of Macedonia was always expected to be difficult to consolidate, but today the National Assembly has received word that Buglarian revolutionary Todor Aleksandrov has restored the organisation, declaring an open war against Belgrade in the process.

The entire situation was caught by news cameras, with many believing it to be the second filmed assassination ever, after Kerensky back in 1936.\n\nOur glorious king’s staunch view on Serbification policies in Macedonia was famously incendiary; in one particular incident he publicly slapped a schoolchild who identified as 'Bulgarian'. Needless to say, the king being a target for the VMRO is no surprise. From what little evidence the police have been able to gather, Alexander’s assasination has been one planned for a long time, having been attempted and called off several times. The fact that police didn’t cotton onto Chernozemski’s actions beforehand is scandalous, but in the midst of the other VMRO chaos it was hard to see such a brazen act coming.

Despite this apparent support for constitutionalism, the juvenile king will almost certainly remain controlled by Zikovic’s government both before and after he comes of age.\n\nThe mood may be muted, however today's ceremony is an important one for Serbia’s continued existence as a stable nation.

According to the Association, these detachments have been preparing in secret for months, arming and training themselves for the time when our reckoning would begin."
serbia.42.a:0 "Excellent!"

serbia.50.t:0 "Old Friends in High Places"
serbia.50.d:0 "It appears we still have friends within the old "Entente" circles and have managed to secure both the sympathetic ears of both Russia and France (and not those Syndicalist bastards who call themselves French). It appears both have adopted similar concepts in regards to the use of an aerial force, with it designed to support the ground forces. It appears they only differ in how much autonomy they allow their airwings, with the Russian favouring the use of Tactical bombers but are more tied into the Army's command structure, whilst the French the use smaller Fighter-Attacker aircraft, but given the freedom of being attached to an independent airforce."
serbia.50.a:0 "We will heed the wisdom of our Slavic Brothers."
serbia.50.b:0 "The French are the masters of the skies."
serbia.50.c:0 "None are available, unfortunately."

serbia.51.t:0 "Replacing the Weltkrieg Fleet"
serbia.51.d:0 "The Serbian Aviation Command is seeking to expand it's air fleet with purchasing new foreign designs to replace its ageing fleet. The French have offered a small about of fighters, with the licence to build them in Serbia. The Russians on the other hand have offered us an entire wing, though we would lack the parts to maintain them efficiently. Lastly, we have been offered smuggled Italian Weltkrieg-era planes, though this offer goes against the reasoning of this request in the first place."
serbia.51.a:0 "The Russian offer is tempting."
serbia.51.b:0 "French designs are exactly what we need."
serbia.51.c:0 "Quantity has a quality of its own."

serbia.52.t:0 "Ground Support Airwing Acquisition"
serbia.52.d:0 "With our pilots now showing their worth, we must obtain airframes that reflect our advisors' doctrine."
serbia.52.a:0 "Look at the size of those bombs!"
serbia.52.b:0 "French design, so magnifique."
serbia.52.c:0 "The Italians won't miss a couple of bombers..."

serbia.53.t:0 "Vidovdan"
serbia.53.d:0 "Vidovdan represents the day to commemorate Saint Prince Lazar and the Serbian holy martyrs who gave their lives to defend the true faith during the epic Battle of Kosovo against the Ottoman Empire on June 28, 1389. It is regarded as a National Holiday in Serbia."
serbia.53.a:0 "Serbia will never forget its heroes!"

serbia.54.t:0 "Construction of the Belgrade-Salonica Railway"
serbia.54.d:0 "Since the end of the 4th Balkan War and our reclamation of Macedonia, Serbian and Greek contractors have been upgrading and connecting the railines from Belgrade to Salonica, which would allow for a continuous journey between the two nations’ heartlands. Today, the first Belgrade-Salonica train journey was undertaken, starting in Serbia and snaking south into Greece. The journey was finished by a meeting of the Serbian and Greek prime ministers, a show of political unity between the Balkan nations."
serbia.54.a:0 "Serbia will never forget its allies!"

serbia.55.t:0 "[From.GetName] Wants to Buy the HMS Lion"
serbia.55.d:0 "[From.GetName], which is in a process of industrialisation and rearmament, has offered to buy the outdated battlecruiser HMS Lion which will become the flagship of their navy. This will surely lead to better relations with the [From.GetAdjective] government and can help them in taking on the navies of their neighbours."
serbia.55.a:0 "We could profit from selling this old junk."
serbia.55.b:0 "No, every ship is needed!"

serbia.56.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
serbia.56.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to sell us the HMS Lion. The ship is now on its way to our ports. With this addition our navy can reign over the Adriatic Sea."
serbia.56.a:0 "A day for celebration!"

serbia.57.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Sell Us the HMS Lion"
serbia.57.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to sell us an old battlecruiser to serve as the flagship of our fleet. We have to search for another solution."
serbia.57.a:0 "We will remember this."

serbia.58.t:0 "Serbia Asks for Montenegro"
serbia.58.d:0 "The resurgent Serbian state today pressured us to give up Montenegro. The largely Serbian population of that province has for some time voiced their wish to join Serbia. In return for the province, Serbia has told us they will not demand any further Illyrian land."
serbia.58.a:0 "It will be for the best."
serbia.58.b:0 "Serbia should stay small."

serbia.59.t:0 "[From.GetName] Cedes Montenegro"
serbia.59.d:0 "Today, Serbia has finally gained access to the Adriatic coast. [From.GetName] agreed to cede to us Montenegro, in return for guarantees of Illyrian territorial integrity. Of course, we will only uphold those for as long as we see it fit."
serbia.59.a:0 "Welcome to the fatherland, brethren."

serbia.60.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses to Cede Montenegro"
serbia.60.d:0 "Our enemies in [From.GetName] have refused to cede Montenegro, which should be rightfully ours. With all diplomatic options depleted, the only thing that we can do is to go to war for Montenegro."
serbia.60.a:0 "Attack!"
serbia.60.b:0 "Unfortunately, we have to bide our time."

serbia.61.t:0 "Integration of Albania"
serbia.61.d:0 "Albania is a part of our country, but large parts of the population resent our presence. We can start an integration process to bring them more in line with our policies, eventually making them an integral part of the [Root.GetAdjective] state."
serbia.61.a:0 "Start the integration process!"
serbia.61.b:0 "This is not a good idea."
serbia.61.tt:0 "§YThis will cause great unrest in Albania§!"

serbia.62.t:0 "Unrest in Albania"
serbia.62.d:0 "The integration process of Albania is in progress, but already the local population is greatly resenting our efforts to bring them more in line with our policies. Riots have broken out in the streets of Tirana. Some suggest to abandon our attempts to fully integrate Albania into Serbia."
serbia.62.a:0 "Albania is a part of the Serbian state!"
serbia.62.b:0 "Abandon our attempts."

serbia.63.t:0 "Tensions Calmed in Albania"
serbia.63.d:0 "The integration process of Albania resulted in a lot of tensions with the local populace. Our police and military have committed to find and jail those responsible for their revolutionary talks, and most of them are rounded up. As a result the tensions have calmed down, and we can continue our effort to fully integrate them into the Serbian state."
serbia.63.a:0 "Great!"

serbia.64.t:0 "Albania Integrated"
serbia.64.d:0 "We have completed the integration process of Albania. We can now finally say that Albania is an integral part of the Serbian state."
serbia.64.a:0 "Great!"

serbia.65.t:0 "Unrest in Albania"
serbia.65.d:0 "The integration process of Albania is in progress, but the local population is resenting our efforts to bring them more in line with our policies. Small resistance groups are trying to harass our occupation forces, though the police and military are able to prevent most acts of sabotage. Regardless, some politicians suggest to abandon our attempts to fully integrate Albania into Serbia."
serbia.65.a:0 "Albania is a part of the Serbian state!"
serbia.65.b:0 "Abandon our attempts."

serbia.66.t:0 "Unrest in Albania"
serbia.66.d:0 "The integration process of Albania is in progress, but the local population is resenting our efforts to bring them more in line with our policies. So far, their resistance has been limited to some demonstrations in Tirana and sporadic acts of civil disobedience. Regardless, some politicians suggest to abandon our attempts to fully integrate Albania into Serbia."
serbia.66.a:0 "Albania is a part of the Serbian state!"
serbia.66.b:0 "Abandon our attempts."

serbia.67.t:0 "Call for Revolution in Albania"
serbia.67.d:0 "Our integration process of Albania has not been successful. The local population continues to resist our occupation in great numbers, making life very hard for Serbians. Word has reached us that some rebel groups are calling for an outright revolution against our occupation. Doves in our government argue that enough blood has been shed, and that Albania should be granted limited autonomy."
serbia.67.a:0 "We do not yield!"
serbia.67.b:0 "Grant Albania limited autonomy."

serbia.68.t:0 "Revolution in Albania"
serbia.68.d:0 "Our integration process of Albania has not been successful. Rebel groups have seized control of Tirana and the surrounding country side. Albania is in open revolt in their struggle for independence."
serbia.68.a:0 "Attack!"
serbia.68.b:0 "Let them go."

dhserbia.1.t:0 "Another Hand Strikes"
dhserbia.1.d:0 "Military sabotage, angry protests, generals plotting in the shadows. All of that was thought to be over since Živković's plot was foiled and White Hand crushed. Yet nothing is that simple in the Balkans.\nAfter it became clear once and for all that the monarchy is not coming back a force more sinister than the White Hand has begun to make its moves. At first most believed that they were just a rumour, a thing of pure reactionary imagination, but it wasn't so. The Phantom of the Past lives again!\n\nThe Black Hand, supported by prominent generals such as Draža Mihailović, has started to cause havoc in Belgrade and military garrisons near the capital. Citing the supposed blunders committed by Vojvoda Bojović and Republicans, the highly organized militants demand the immediate restoration of the monarchy and release of their imprisoned leader, Dragutin Dimitrijević.\nWhile some in our government think that agreeing to their demands could be used to peacefully disarm them and control the king as a puppet, other only see the Black Hand as nothing more than terrorists hellbent on casting Serbia into darkness. Only one question remains, how shall we proceed?"
dhserbia.1.a:0 "All hail Nj.K.V. Aleksandar!"
dhserbia.1.b:0 "All hail Nj.K.V. Đorđe!"
dhserbia.1.c:0 "Gendarmerie, disperse the rabble!"

dhserbia.2.t:0 "Our Way Forward"
dhserbia.2.d:0 "With the death of our dear leader, Apis, his wishes as stipulated by his will are to keep Serbia ruled by a military elite under the firm hand of Dragustin Keresovic who could enforce unity and readiness among the Serbian people for the next war with our mortal enemies. Civil dominance over military affairs weakened Serbia during the Weltkrieg and by upholding Apis wishes we will certainly prevail and free our Serbian brothers living under foreign control. But contradictory voices are calling for a return to a civil governance under Dimitrijie Ljotic who could maneuver diplomatically more easily by securing reliable allies and discourage Austrian intervention. Military governance could be seen from Vienna as a resurge in chauvinistic action and this could limit Serbia’s resolve in the next confrontation with Bulgaria. Both sides agree that a future conflict with our neighbors is inevitable, but which side of the argument will prevail?"
dhserbia.2.a:0 "Dragustin Keresovic and his junta prevail!"
dhserbia.2.b:0 "We need to be carefull, Dimitrije Ljotic is the new leader!"

dhserbia.3.t:0 "A New Constitution"
dhserbia.3.d:0 "A new Constitution for a new King! The social contract has been redefined by our benevolent king to encompass and promote the Serbian virtues and conservative values instilled in us by our ancestors.  In the fight against global syndicalism and foreign threats, the urgency of necessity must overcome other civil commodities. As such, the new constitution will discourage foreign subterfuges by dissolving the parliamentary menace that maintained instability in our country and enact press censorship over those papers that denigrate our national spirit. In a time where international relations are as tense as they have ever been, the must have unobstructed powers of actions over the legislative and executive branch of the government. The King assured his subjects that the most important matter at hand for our country is to mobilize and rebuild a culturally enriched Serbia ready to fight again the Goliath other foreign threats."
dhserbia.3.a:0 "Onwards to a new future!"

dhserbia.4.t:0 "A new economic model"
dhserbia.4.d:0 "For the past years some plans have been prepared for the implementation of a new economic and societal model that would keep the corruption of syndicalism away from Serbia, this system advocates for the organization of society by corporate groups, such as agricultural, labour, military, scientific, or guild associations on the basis of their common interests and it is believed that society will reach a peak of harmonious functioning when each of its divisions efficiently performs its designated function, such as a body's organs individually contributing its general health and functionality."
dhserbia.4.a:0 "Serbia will never fall to syndicalism!"

dhserbia.5.t:0 "Expand the funding for the Serbian Culture Club"
dhserbia.5.d:0 "The Serbian culture club has been an important center for many Serb intellectuals. The orginization, effective immedietley, will have  significant budget expansion. The club promotes the advance of Serbian national interest, and will be vital in establishing a Greater Serb state. It shall oversee the budget of the newspapers, our student wing the "White Eagles" and what to do with our songs and dances."
dhserbia.5.a:0 "For a better Serbia!"

dhserbia.6.t:0 "White Eagles"
dhserbia.6.d:0 "The "White Eagles" is the student wing of our movement, meant to shape the future of serbian youth into something great. There have been discussions for an entire week in order to see what kind of budget it shall be given to it, some have said that this is quite important and thus the funding should match it while others have said that it's doing well as it is and there's no need to give it anymore funds. Of course we could always stick to their normal funding and move on to our other issues to adress."
dhserbia.6.a:0 "Give them better funding!"
dhserbia.6.b:0 "The proposed funding is enough."
dhserbia.6.c:0 "Best use these funds somewhere else."

dhserbia.7.t:0 "The Status of our Newspapers"
dhserbia.7.d:0 "In order to rightfully guide our people, several administrative officials have proposed a funding boost to several newspaper orginizations with a lot of it going to the state's own "Fatherland". The newspapers have activley been very important to sway political opinions, and could be extremley useful in case of important national events."
dhserbia.7.a:0 "The people need to see our words no matter what!"
dhserbia.7.b:0 "The proposed funding is well enough for our purposes."
dhserbia.7.c:0 "The newspapers do well enough without our help."

dhserbia.8.t:0 "Songs and Dances"
dhserbia.8.d:0 "The Question of Songs and Dances has been brought to the culture club in order to be resolved and hopefully settled for a while. The question of what shall we do with our songs and dances, should we keep them truly traditional and unchanged or should we encourage some more creativity in combining more traditional elements of our music and dances with newer trends in order to create a new synthesis. Whichever option we pick it will surely have an influence in future music and dance makers."
dhserbia.8.a:0 "Maybe try to mix traditional elements together with modern elements?"
dhserbia.8.b:0 "Tradition is the bedrock to our society."

dhserbia.9.t:0 "The King's Men"
dhserbia.9.d:0 "It seems that the "King's Men" project has been a success and more people wish to join the program every new day. This, of course, raises a big problem , the "King's Men" are supposed to be elite troops trained to protect our king from harm or danger if we increase their numbers substancially it would make them more like a branch of the military and far less specialized then they are now. This problem has reached the highest levels of our government and it has been debated for days what the best course of action should be and the choice that has resulted from these discussions is..."
dhserbia.9.a:0 "The more the merrier!"
dhserbia.9.b:0 "The less there are the more specialized they can be."

dhserbia.10.t:0 "Our Volunteer Corps"
dhserbia.10.d:0 "It has been proposed that the ZBOR movement create it's own para-military unit in order to keep order on the streets of Serbia and to give the men some training for our future conflicts. The new unit will be under the command of Colonel Konstantin Mušicki and it will consist of 12 companies, each 120-150 men strong. Of course as this is a volunteer organization we shall not force anyone to join it and the only reason one might is if it wishes to fight for it's homeland or wishes to unite it. However the question remains: what kind of funding should we give to this organization?"
dhserbia.10.a:0 "Give it substancial funding."
dhserbia.10.b:0 "A small portion over the standard funding should work."
dhserbia.10.c:0 "Standard funding should be more than enough."

dhserbia.11.t:0 "Death of our King"
dhserbia.11.d:0 "Alexander II, our King, has died in his sleep. A week of mourning has been declared, however the question of a new king still lingers, who shall be the new king? Should it be Prince Peter the heir apparent or should it prince George the one who his loyal to our cause?"
dhserbia.11.a:0 "Long Live King Peter!"
dhserbia.11.a:0 "Long Live King George!"

dhserbia.15.t:0 "The Glories of our History"
dhserbia.15.d:0 "Serbian history is the noblest, most inspirational story one can hear, at least according to our rhetoric. As such, the government has taken steps to further popularise the glories of the past, and spread public awareness of our national story. There have thus been 3 different proposals for a planned exhibition in Belgrade, which will showcase the state's narrative of Serbian history. Many are arguing that the exhibition should focus on Serbia's military history, and the valour of its soldiers through the ages, while others believe that we should focus on the story of how the Serbs nobly kept their faith in the face of centuries of Muslim oppression. Others, meanwhile, are suggesting a broader exhibition which can encompass all of these themes. Which project should we support?"
dhserbia.15.a:0 "The soldiers of tomorrow should be inspired by those of yesterday!"
dhserbia.15.b:0 "Focusing on religion will please the Church, and the faithful of course."
dhserbia.15.c:0 "There's no harm in a compromise."

dhserbia.12.t:0 "Slander of Syndicalism"
dhserbia.12.d:0 "Due to our new economic and social policies emphasising mutual support and solidarity, various opposition figures have begun making wild and dangerous claims that these noble ideals are, in fact, syndicalist. Likening our own intervention in the economy to the mass collectivisation of land and industry in France or England, they allege that our government is nothing short of an international conspiracy to spread socialism across the Balkans. Of course, such subversive rumours can not be tolerated, and the secret police will have to be further empowered to stamp this madness out."
dhserbia.12.a:0 "Silence these fools!"

dhserbia.13.t:0 "The Black General"
dhserbia.13.d:0 "Many arguments pro and against the will of Apis have been had and it has finally been decided that a junta will be the best course of action at the moment. The parliament of Serbia shall be abolished and all actions the new military government shall be held accountable by the king to prevent any abuse of power and it shall give back the powers back to a civilian government after the times of danger have passed."
dhserbia.13.a:0 "The army shall bring us stability in these trying times."

dhserbia.14.t:0 "The Serbian State proclamation"
dhserbia.14.d:0 "A new emergengy constitution has been created in order to solidify the legitimacy of the new regime but also in order to give some peace of mind to those who think that our government will soon be couped or deposed by some other force that seeks to control the serbian state. The constitution stipulates that the military government will be held accountable to the king and that it will be dissolved soon after the dangers against the state have passsed."
dhserbia.14.a:0 "Onwards Serbian people, onwards to your destiny!"

dhserbia.16.t:0 "A pushback against our new society"
dhserbia.16.d:0 "The new constitution seems to have sparked some outrage amidst the population thinking that this situation will only get worse and that the politics of people have surpassed the needs of the people. Both the king and the black general have held speeches reassuring the population that this constitution is only temporary and that the situation will soon return to the one before the austrian occupation after the Weltkrieg and while it seems that these speeches have calmed some people some are still doubtful of the our new regime."
dhserbia.16.a:0 "People need to realize that those measures are temporary!"

dhserbia.17.t:0 "A Youth Wing To Form"
dhserbia.17.d:0 "One of the projects that the civilian part of our movement was the formation and expansion of a youth wing which would've formed the children of our people into great serbian men and women. This idea has been evaluated by our staff and it was concluded that this would bring some stability to our regime and even the king seemed to approve of the idea wholeheartedly."
dhserbia.17.a:0 "We can only hope this will be sufficient."

dhserbia.18.t:0 "A show of might"
dhserbia.18.d:0 "This day has been scheduled for a simple military drill however some of our upper staff has decided that this is a great oportunity to show that the serbs have returned and they are as strong as ever. The proposed plan is to turn the military drill into a great public parade that will hopefully attract the attention of our neighbors, of course there's the posibility of such a show being ignored by them however it will still be a great morale boost to our people."
dhserbia.18.a:0 "We shall see what results this has garnered us."

dhserbia.19.t:0 "A statue for Apis"
dhserbia.19.d:0 "While some have been against the idea, it has been decided that in honor of the great king maker Dragutin Dimitrijević, also known as Apis, that a statue in his likeness shall be erected in Belgrade. People fear that this decision might anger the austrians since they see him as one of the killers of Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand however such claims will remain as nothing but claims as there is no actual proof of a connection between Gavrilo Princip's assassination and Apis."
dhserbia.19.a:0 "A great statue for our great hero."

dhserbia.20.t:0 "The Illyrian Socialists"
dhserbia.20.d:0 "Although our triumphal liberation of the Serbian lands to the West has left the entire nation and people better off, there is a growing problem in the newly-freed territories. During the chaos of the war, socialist elements in former Illyria retreated into the mountains and forests, hoping to fight another day against our brave armies. Now known as "partisans", these leftist scum are increasingly attacking our convoys and garrisons across the countryside, an issue we can ignore for no longer. As such, General Draza Mihailovic has been sent to the formerly Illyrian lands, with a clear mission to hunt down and eliminate these French pawns."
dhserbia.20.a:0 "Good luck, General!"

dhserbia.21.t:0 "Josip Broz Tito, I Presume"
dhserbia.21.d:0 "Through dynamic tactics and great cunning, General Mihailović has managed to greatly fight back the Illyrian insurgency, capturing thousands of misguided rebels. Notable among the prisoners is Josip Broz Tito, who largely commanded the insurrection, scheming to crush Serbia from the highest peaks and densest woods of Croatia. Hauled before an extensive military tribunal, Tito has been found guilty of countless charges, and condemned to the guillotine. General Mihailovic himself has agreed to supervise the execution, a clear sign of the triumph of the Serbian nation against socialism and foreign oppression."
dhserbia.21.a:0 "So long socialist dog."

dhserbia.22.t:0 "Our Brothers Need Help"
dhserbia.22.d:0 "Our Brothers under the Austrian heel have contacted us in order to aid them in escaping their clutches. The king and it's council have been in talks in what our best course of action is and what consequences in taking them will. After a few days of delibaration it has been accepted that our best course of action is..."
dhserbia.22.a:0 "Offering them our full support."
dhserbia.22.b:0 "Offering them limited assitance."
dhserbia.22.c:0 "Giving them funds is the best we can do."

dhserbia.23.t:0 "Our Brothers Have responded"
dhserbia.23.d:0 "Offering our brothers the full support of the Serbian state seemed to be the right call as now we have a powerful ally in them and they can help in the fight against the enemies that seek to destroy whatever is left of the Serbian identity."
dhserbia.23.a:0 "Thank you Brothers!"

dhserbia.24.t:0 "Our Brothers Have responded"
dhserbia.24.d:0 "It seems that our gamble with the outside serbs have paid off. Not only are they ready to join our efforts in destroying serbia's enemies but it also boosted the morale of our men how are happy that they will fight together with their brothers and not just bleed for them."
dhserbia.24.a:0 "Thank you Brothers!"

dhserbia.25.t:0 "Our Brothers Have responded"
dhserbia.25.d:0 "It seems that our brothers have decided to pay back our help which we gave them some time ago and some extra in order to fight the good fight. It is a shame that this is the best we could get however we need to look forward to a better future."
dhserbia.25.a:0 "We will take what we can get."

dhserbia.25.t:0 "Father of the King Dies"
dhserbia.25.d:0 "Alexander II, the father of our King, has died in his sleep. A week of mourning is to declared in honor of such an event."
dhserbia.25.a:0 "Prepare the necesary arrangements."

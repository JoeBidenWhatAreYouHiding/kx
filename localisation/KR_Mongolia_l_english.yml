Mongolia's aristocrats have always had their hand in the runnings of their country, and now is no different. However, ever since Ungern came to power in 1921, the wealth and influence of the aristocrats has been under threat. Ungern has proven in recent years that he does not fear seizing the wealth of these nobles, nor does he fear cracking down on their influence to keep control. However, in 1927, the princes and aristocrats of Mongolia joined together in an organisation titled the Yazgurtan Survaljtan, lead by aristocratic figurehead Prince Demchugdongrub.

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_KHAN_DESC:0 "Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, the 'Mad Baron', and officially referred to by his noble title, Darkhan Khoshoi Chin Wang in the degree of Khan, had a troubled upbringing, constantly moving and with a father who was committed to an insane asylum. His family estate in Estonia was burned down in 1905, which confirmed his anti-peasant and eventually anti-communist beliefs. He eventually joined Pavlovskoe Military School in St. Petersburg, where he became interested in the occult and buddhism. After graduation he was transferred to Siberia, where he became known for his heavy drinking and dangerous moods. In 1913 he moved to Khovd in Outer Mongolia as and officer in the detachment at the Russian consulate, after not being allowed to fight for Mongolian independence. \n\nIn the First Weltkrieg, Ungern fought first in Galicia then, after a 2 month prison stint following attacking another officer in a drunken rage, in the Caucasus. After the breakout of the Russian Civil War, he fought with Semyonov and the whites in Siberia, acting relatively independently against the communists. Ungern eventually travelled through China where he married Manchu Princess Ji. Eventually, he moved to Urga, and defeated the Chinese garrison stationed there, restoring the Bogd Khan to the throne and proclaiming Mongolia independent. \n\nUngern himself did not get too involved in Mongol problems, but he kept the peace through force. After narrowly defeating a socialist revolution in 1921 and 1924, he was forced to get more involved. His forces prowled the streets as he hunted out dissidents and purged Mongolian society, including in temples. When the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu was brought to Urga in 1933, Ungern promised he would rule as regent until the boy came of age. However, with Ungern’s grip dependent on his russian military clique, there are fears he will keep the power for himself. \n\n§rFurther fears enforced by his recent erratic behaviour, he has declared himself the reincarnation of Genghis Khan. Befitting this title, the new Khan has engaged in aggressive expansionism in the name of restoring the Mongol Empire!§"
POLITICS_DEMCHUGDONGRUB_DESC:0 "Born in Chahar, Demchugdongrub was the only son of Namjil Wangchuk, Duoluo Duling Junwang of Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. After the death of his father at only 6, Demchugdongrub inherited the title of Duoluo Duling Junwang. Under Yuan Shikai in 1912, he was promoted to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong. In Chahar he remained for many years, becoming a de facto leader of the province during the chaos following the end of the First Weltkrieg.\n\nDemchugdongrub didn't join Ungern-Sternberg's side until 1926, following Ungern's seizing of Chahar Province from the Guominjun. Ungern met Demchugdongrub in Chahar, and allowed him to keep his titles and to lead Chahar Province. Under Demchugdongrub, Chahar Province grew in military industry, and became far less rebellious against Ungern. In Chahar he remained for many years, funding Pan-Mongol movements throughout Inner Mongolia. In 1932, Demchugdongrub, with a number of other Inner Mongolian nobles, moved to Urga, to get more involved in its politics. Ungern, recognising Demchugdongrub's popularity and power, appointed him Minister for the Economy, to try to keep the aristocrats on his side.\n\nDuring the Western Rebellion, Demchugdongrub, leader of the Yazgurtan Survaljtan, seized power. Now, Demchugdongrub's dream of a united Pan-Mongol state can be fully realised."
POLITICS_UNENBAYAN_DESC:0 "Much like many of the nobles who dominated Mongolian politics for many years, Ünenbayan was born in Inner Mongolia. Also known by his Chinese name, Wu Heling, he graduated from school in Chengde, and afterwards studied law in Peking University while also working at the Minister of Interior in the Beiyang government. There, he worked with Prince Gungsangnorbu of Harqin Right Banner at the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission. After he graduated from university in 1926, he got more involved in Mongolian affairs, getting into contact with Prince Demchugdongrub and Yondonwangchug in Chahar. Eventually he decided to travel there, to work under Demchugdongrub in Chahar Province. Later, when Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga with many Chahar nobles, he left Ünenbayan there to effectively rule the autonomous province. He proved rather effective at this, only eventually leaving Chahar during the Western Rebellion, so that he could assist Demchugdongrub in Urga. Following the successful democratic revolution lead by the Mongol Ardīn Nam, Ünenbayan lobbied to stop the discrimination against the aristocrats of Urga. Being a younger man now in power of Mongolia, Ünenbayan sees an opportunity to mend the rift between the rich elite and the poor peasants, while defending the democracy that Mongolia has become."
POLITICS_7TH_CHANGKYA_KHUTUKHTU_DESC:0 "Born Lobsang Pelden Tenpe Dronme, the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu is an extremely important figure in Mongolia. During the Qing Dynasty and the short lived Beiyang Government, the Changkya Khutukhtu’s were the head of the Gelug line of Tibetan Buddhism in Inner Mongolia. After Ungern-Sternberg took the province of Xilingol from the Guominjun, the 7th Changkya Khutuktu declared his loyalty to Ungern-Sternberg, and travelled to Urga to work in Gandantegchinlen Monastery. After regularly holding speeches outside of the monastery, he became a very popular and important figure in Urga.\n\nHowever, his intentions changed in 1930. Ungern-Sternberg, after a small peasant rebellion in Urga, blamed multiple high ranking lamas, and purged them. This caused massive uproar in the highly buddhist society, especially in the upper echelons. The 7th Changkya Khutukhtu therefore decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a secretive group of high ranking lamas who lobbied for increased theocracy in Mongolian society. After the Western Rebellion, the Buddyn Zövlöl were able to seize power, and fully begin to implement their plan to reform Mongolian society to a Gelug Buddhist centre."
POLITICS_JAMSRANGIIN_TSEVEEN_DESC:0 "A central figure in Mongolian politics, Jamsrangiin Tseveen was born in Transbaikal during the Russian Empire. He went to a Buryat private school in St. Petersburg, and eventually began visiting Buryat tribes in Irkutsk. In 1902, he became an auditor at St. Petersburg University. While there, he went on many research trips across Transbaikal and Outher Mongolia. After a few years he began to teach Mongolian Language there, and also visited Inner Mongolia and Ordos. When the Bogd Khaanate became independent in 1911, Tseveen supervisied a secular Russian school there and was editor for two newspapers, the Shine toli and Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig.\n\nAfter Mongolia was occupied by Xu Shuzheng in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at Irkutsk University. He also travelled around the area and met with many discontent Mongolias, who eventually founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam. At their founding congress in 1921, Tseveen wrote the Ten Aspirations, the party’s platform. Following their failed revolution in 1921, Tseveen went into hiding in Transbaikal, helping continue to organise the MAN. After the death of the Bogd Khan in 1924, Tseveen helped rally Buryat rebels in joining the MAN rebels in once again trying to overthrow Unger-Sternberg. After this failure and the death of their leader, Damdin Sükhbaatar, the MAN went back into hiding. Since then, Tseveen has travelled across the more empty regions of Mongolia, educating the people and conducting research.\n\nFollowing the Western Rebellion and the MAN takeover, Tseveen began to see the problems in the party. Over the years he grew more disillusioned with the more radical elements of the party, and saw it as corrupt. Following a power struggle in the party, Tseveen created the Mongol Libyeral Nam, as an opposition to the MAN."
POLITICS_SOLIIN_DANZAN_DESC:0 "As a young man, revolutionary Soliin Danzan was a living as a horse thief, poor and struggle to survive. He lived like this for many years, until he went to Urga to work as a customs official in the Ministry of Finance. In 1919, he, Dansrabilegiin Dogsom, and Damdin Sükhbaatar formed the nationalist group Züün Khüree, which later merged with the Konsulyn Denj group, led by Dogsomyn Bodoo. For a few years after this, the MAN worked with Russian bolsheviks in trying to take over Mongolia. This culminated in the 1921 revolution against Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, which barely failed. Danzan went into hiding after this, as did the rest of the MAN. Danzan was one of the key organisers of the 1924 revolution, another failed mission which led to the death of Sükhbaatar. Following a dangerous power struggle with Dambym Chagdarjav and Dogsomyn Bodoo, Danzan became chairman of the party, once again in hiding. For the years since, Danzan helped push the MAN to a more nationalistic and less bolshevik group, completely disavowing from the failed bolsheviks from Russia.\n\nAfter the Western Rebellion in 1936, Soliin Danzan and the MAN were able to seize power, finally allowing him to implement his policies. However, there are still many threats to his rule. The party is still very split, with power hungry members ready to strike. Also, the introduction of democracy, though something the party promises, could be a threat to the party’s rule."

Now, following Ünenbayan making Demchugdongrub Head of State, the Popular Prince finally has a chance to realise his Pan-Mongol dream."

He almost died in prison, but survived long enough to be broken out by Ungern’s forces and was cared back to full health. Since then, he has fought by the side of Ungern, owing him his life. However, his allegiance does not lie with Ungern, but rather Mongolia as a whole."

Demchugdongrub didn't join Ungern until 1926, after Chahar province was seized from the Guominjun. For a few years after that, Demchugdongrub stayed in Chahar, leading divisions against Chinese border incursions. He even had to command troops against Chahar citizens, as many of the Han Chinese rebelled against Ungern's heavily pro-Mongol and pro-Russian rule. Demchugdongrub travelled to Urga in 1932 with Altanochir, and got quickly involved in its politics. After only a few months he was made head of the Yazgurtan Survaljtan, and so he focused far less on military matters, though they remained important to him."

Forced into Outer Mongolia in 1910, he travelled to Urga in 1911 after the National Revolution with his family, and the Bogd Khan himself promoted him to general. He fought for the liberation of Inner Mongolia 1913, and sieged a fortress with help from bandit leader Ja Lama. Since joining Ungern’s side, he has continued to fight many battles on the Chinese border, even training Mongolian guerrillas in Ulanqab and Ordos."

He commanded the division during the 1921 MAN revolution, and lead another division during the 1924 MAN revolution. He has become very loyal to Ungern, and hates syndicalism and socialism almost as much as Ungern himself."

He took part in multiple battles against communists in Siberia, where he was promoted to commander of White Russia. He commanded White Russian troops and had large control of Siberia. He eventually joined Ungern's forces in Mongolia, bringing much of his remaining forces. Ungern almost had him killed for opposing him, but he showed his skill during the 1921 attempted MAN revolution in Mongolia. He then travelled to the west, to have more independence from Ungern, still worried he will eventually be purged.

He moved to Siberia at the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, where he got involved in Kolchak’s anti-communist government. When travelling into Mongolia, he met Ungern and joined his side, due to his interest in Ungern's strange beliefs about buddhism and monarchism. He stuck with Ungern, becoming his Chief of Intelligence and a close political advisor. Following a diplomatic trip to Japan and then the USA, he went back to Mongolia, performing counterintelligence against the MAN revolution of 1924, where his intelligence lead to the attack of their base in Uliastai and the death of their leader Sükhbaatar. He continued to work counterintelligence, and grew even closer to Ungern, being promoted to the rank of general in 1926. This was mostly a symbolic promotion, for although he had commanded some troops in his time, Ossendowski was not majorly skilled at it, and did not have much experience with it."

He was assigned to Inner Mongolia, where he stayed until he was contacted by Prince Demchugdongrub after Xilingol was seized by Mongolia from the Guominjun. After some negotiations, Buyandelger defected to Mongolia, and travelled with Demchugdongrub to Urga so that they could be introduced. Buyandelger did not stay for long, and he soon travelled back to Xilingol with his forces. In Inner Mongolia, he continues to train Mongolian guerrillas in areas under Chinese control. However, many still question his loyalty to Urga. He defected to Ungern’s side very quickly, and some rumours even indicate Buyandelger still communicates with his old friends in Beijing."

MON_bribe_nobles_support:0 "Bribe the Princes"
MON_bribe_nobles_support_desc:0 "Though the nobles are opposing our government currently, we can easily take some of the less loyal nobles by bribing them. The princes should be so pliant towards conformity after decades of chinese supression."

MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism:0 "Display Ungern's Buddhism"
MON_advertise_sternberg_buddhism_desc:0 "Many in Mongolia do not believe Ungern-Sternberg is committed enough to protecting buddhism and acting in a buddhist lifestyle. Some public displays of him and some loyal monks meditating and holding some speeches should convince them otherwise."

MON_the_greatest_dictator:0 "Cult of Personality"

### Events ###

mon.1.t:0 "Introduction to Mongolia"
mon.1.d:0 "Mongolia was ruled by the Qing dynasty for centuries. It wasn’t until the Xinhai revolution in 1911 where Mongolia declared their independence from China. However, the new Republic of China still claimed Outer Mongolia as Chinese territory. This independence was shattered in 1919, when Chinese troops under Xu Shuzheng occupied Mongolia, due to fears of Russian invasion. However, in late 1920, White Russian leader Roman von Ungern-Sternberg, leading his Asiatic Cavalry Division, moved into Urga and, supported by Buddhist religious leader the Bogd Khan, defeated the Chinese.\n\nUngern restored the Bogd Khan as leader of the nation, and enforced his leadership with an iron fist. He could not rule the nation alone, however, and had to pander to the Mongolian aristocrats and nobles to gain support. Ungern faced resistance, primarily from socialist rebels, who founded the Mongol Ardīn Nam in 1920. In 1921, the socialists decided to rebel, to try to remove Ungern from power. After much fighting, Ungern was able to keep hold of the nation, and the Mongol Ardīn Nam were forced into hiding. They remained active, however, and rebelled once again in 1924, following the death of the Bogd Khan, declaring Ungern's authority to rule 'illegitimate'. This revolution failed once again, and lead to the death's of multiple high up MAN members, primarily their de-facto leader Damdin Sükhbaatar. With this death, the group were once again forced to go into hiding.\n\nFollowing the death of the Bogd Khan, or the 8th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, Ungern ruled as regent while trying to find the 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu, the most important person in Mongolia for Tibetan buddhism. When he was found in 1933, he was brought to Urga to be pruned to eventually lead when he is old enough. Following the purge of multiple lama's in 1930, however, buddhists in government decided to form the Buddyn Zövlöl, a circle of buddhist fanatics lead by the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, one of the most important people in Tibetan buddhism. They fear that Ungern will never relinquish his power as regent until his death, and fear that he is leading Mongolia away from the ideals of buddhism."
mon.1.a:0 "What about now?"
mon.2.t:0 "Ja Lama's Bandits Spotted In Western Mongolia"
mon.2.d:0 "Mongolia is a nation regularly plagued by banditry and raiding. Due to the sheer size of the nation compared to its minimal population, it is difficult to find these bandits and bring them to justice. However, following Ungern's ascension to power in 1921, he clamped down on any resistance, sending his forces out into the deepest areas of Mongolia to root out bandit groups. The brutality of Ungern's forces had become rather famous in Mongolia, mercilessly torturing and killing any bandits, criminals, or resistance fighters they found. Many bandits went into hiding, for fear of being executed by what have become known as Ungern's 'Death Squads'.\n\nHowever, over the years, Ungern has been having more and more trouble in keeping Mongolia in his grip. MAN rebels are regularly disrupting supply lines, and bandit activity has been growing more and more, especially in the west, where our troops are spread very thin. With Russian money we were able to put down bandit forces, sometimes even through bribery. However, with Russia declaring that their aid to us will be halted, many bandit groups seem to be coming out of their caves, most notably Ja Lama's Yum-Beise bandits. Ja Lama was an independence fighter and warlord back in the 1910's, who, after murdering all the envoys we sent to him, went into hiding. With Russian aid ending, leading to an inability to keep control of these western regions, Ja Lama's group has decided to come back out of the cracks, to reign terror once more."

mon.4.d:0 "It appears some of our worst fears have become a reality. We are just getting reports that Ja Lama's group just raided and pillaged a small nomadic community, just north of Khovd. By the time some of our troops got there, all that was left was burning tents and dead bodies. The bandits could be seen in the distance, but our troops did not give chase, primarily due to the immense size of the group. According to the troops that saw it, the group was massive, and could easily beat the garrisons in places like Khovd or Uliastai. Hopefully, they do not attempt a move like that."

mon.6.t:0 "Bandits Defeat Local Militia"
mon.6.d:0 "Following the raiding of the nomad village, a local military leader decided to act. He gathered a small force of militia from the nearby tribes and villages, armed them with whatever old guns he could find, and travelled out to confront them. Hopes were high, and they expected little resistance and good results.\n\nIt was a massacre. Of the large group that travelled out to get them, very few made it back. The survivors said that the force was huge, numbers maybe even in the thousands. Not only this, but apparently their forces were organised, far more than any bandit gang should be. There are fears that these may not just be simple bandits.\n\nUngern's leadership has been characterised by his ruthless attitude toward any opposition, and in doing this he had found himself with many enemies throughout the country. With Russia pulling out its aid, perhaps it is not only bandits coming out of hiding."
mon.6.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Khovd garrison!"
mon.7.t:0 "Khovd City Guard Lay Down Arms"
mon.7.d:0 "After sending out the call for the Khovd garrison to move in and defeat the bandit group, we got a strange response. The Khovd guard refused to attack the bandits. The leading officer stationed there has sent us a message, stating:\n\n'My troops refuse to fight against their brothers. For too long, we have received no aid or help from Urga. The only thing you, Ungern-Sternberg, have done for us, is murder our families in the name of securing your reign. This is no longer simple banditry. It is time for change.'\n\nWe have sent out our response back, but it will be a while before they receive it. By that point, it may be too late."
mon.7.a:0 "What is going on?"
mon.8.t:0 "The Western Rebellion"
mon.8.d:0 "The situation is much worse than first expected. It seems that it was not only bandits that had returned to Mongolia. Many are just people who hate Ungern's dictatorial leadership, but there are other factions involved. Extreme buddhist monks have radicalised many of the peasants, who now rise up against us. Others have joined the Mongol Ardīn Nam, a revolutionary socialist group. Following their failed revolutions in 1921 and 1924 the group went into hiding, but in the chaos, they see now as the time to rise up once again. Thankfully, all the groups oppose each other just as much as they oppose Ungern, so there is much infighting. In the western cities of Khovd and Uliastai, rebels rose up and charged into the government building, killing our mayors and declaring that Ungern's rule illegitimate. Although their force is small compared to our full army, the chaos this rebellion will cause will give Ungern's opponents in Urga the chance to dismantle Ungern's regime."
mon.8.a:0 "These rebels must be crushed!"
mon.9.t:0 "MAN Rebels Defeat Us At Otgon"
mon.9.d:0 "After sending in some of our troops to retake a town east of Uliastai, that had been previously taken by MAN rebels, they armed the peasants of Otgon with as many guns as they could get. Bolstered by bandits sympathetic to their cause, they threw up some small fortifications and prepared for our assault. Following some of our troops defecting to the rebels, our forces were crushed by the MAN insurgents. News of the MAN victory travels fast across the country, being romanticised as a heroic battle against Ungern's evil death squads."

The group have very large influence in our government, due to many of our officials being active members. However, the amount of funding they demand is ridiculous, and we will be unable to raise it by ourselves."

mon.12.d:0 "A group of bandits in the west have completely destroyed Altai City, raiding it for food and money, then razing the buildings to the ground. This has left hundreds of people without homes or food. There are many problems when trying to help them. It will cost a large amount of money to pay for the aid and to get it to the people safely. Our main source of money currently is from the nobles' treasuries, but continuing to take their money will lead to further disdain from them. There is another option, however. We also have the ability to secretly send the aid to the MAN rebels, who will reach Altai. Although it will make MAN look like the heroes, it will possibly save the lives of hundreds of people, or at least dissuade some of them from joining the rebellion."

mon.13.d:0 "Due to the conflict in the west of the nation, most of our generals and army leaders have been forced to leave the capital. A large amount of these army officers and generals are extremely loyal to Ungern, due to the large amount of money Ungern spends on the armed forces, and the fact that the officer class is dominated by White Russians who remained with Ungern after the civil war ended in the north. This loyalty is one of the main reasons Ungern has been able to stay in power for so long.\n\nThe problem for Ungern is clear. With most of the Ungern loyalists leaving Urga to go to the west, opposing political factions are seeing their chance to act. The MAN party have always had decent support in Urga, although being illegal, and many of the peasants hold sympathies to them. Both the Buddyn Zövlöl and the Yazgurtan Survaljtan have great influence in the government, and stand ready to move in and take over if given the chance. Ungern must walk a fine line between the factions if he is to survive the next few months..."

By the end of the fighting, the building had mostly collapsed. Most of the monks at the monastery were killed, and to make matters worse, some of our men stole most of their valuables and supplies. After hearing this news, the Buddyn Zövlöl are demanding that we once again pay to rebuild and repair the broken monastery."

mon.15.d:0 "After weeks of constant fighting in the west, national troops are beginning to beat the rebels in the steppes. To counter this, it seems the rebels have changed their tactics. They have instead decided to take full control of multiple main cities in the region, and hold out for as long as possible. We see this currently, with rebel groups currently sieging against our last forces in Uliastai.\n\nAnother example of this is Khem-Beldyr, the current capital of Tuva. A few weeks ago, a small detachment of rebels traveled across the western steppes to Khem-Beldyr, where they were quickly able to defeat the small garrison in the city. With control in Khem-Beldyr, they have effective control over the Tuvan province, and we will have to take it back before we are able to finally defeat these rebels."
mon.15.a:0 "Damn."
mon.16.t:0 "Rebels occupy Uliastai"
mon.16.d:0 "Finally, the rebels have able to take Uliastai from loyalist forces. As a major stronghold in the west, we must take it back before we are able to at all prove ourselves to be the legitimite government."
mon.16.a:0 "We cannot let this stand."
mon.17.t:0 "Chahars clash with settled Khalkha Mongols"
mon.17.d:0 "In the province of Chahar, ethnic tensions have recently arisen between the Chahar Mongols, the majority in the region, and the Khalkha Mongols, who live primarily in Outer Mongolia itself. There has always been tension between these two groups, primarily because the Chahar Mongols always aided the Chinese, and regularly fought against Mongol rebels. With many of the generals and military units based there now moving to the west, violence has erupted in the area once again."
mon.17.a:0 "Are we not all Mongolian?"
mon.18.t:0 "The rebels are beginning to lose ground"
mon.18.d:0 "It seems the rebels' methods have not born that many fruits. With their main troops having moved into the cities to hold out, loyalist forces were easily able to crush any stragglers they left behind. Also, though they were able to take Khem-Beldyr and Uliastai, they have not been that successful elsewhere. Other cities like Khovd fell back into our fold. Victory in the West could be only weeks away, so we must secure our position politically."
mon.18.a:0 "Excellent."
mon.19.t:0 "Bandits crush nomadic village"

mon.20.d:0 "With much focus going on both the Western Rebellion and the political battle for Urga, the people of Urga have been forgotten. With many roads being destroyed or in disrepair, much food from outside of the city is no longer getting in. For some people, it has been weeks since they've had a good, proper meal. The people have decided to act. After another soup kitchen closed indefinitely in one of the poorest regions of Urga, people began smashing the shops windows or breaking in. After a few minutes this began across the whole street, and within an hour most of the city was in full on riots. To stop this chaos we must spend money to get food for the people."

mon.21.d:0 "Boris Rezukhin, a brutal general and Ungern loyalist, has no real idea what is happening in Urga. When the Western Rebellion began, he was sent to Mörön to make sure rebellious activity did not spread across the whole nation. Due to the chaos in the capital, we have been unable to contact him for months. We have now finally learned what has happened in Mörön. Some refugees from the city, arriving in Urga today, have spoken of how Rezukhin has run the city as his own personal fiefdom, increasing the taxes massively to be kept for himself, and massacring civilians by the hundreds if they even question his leadership. No doubt this will make us less popular."
mon.21.a:0 "Damn him!"
mon.22.t:0 "Lamas come out in support of the Buddyn Zövlöl"
mon.22.d:0 "Though chaos has engulfed Urga for many months now, the lamas of some of the main monasteries have remained rather silent on which side they support. Though the Gandantegchinlen Monastery currently houses the 7th Changkya Khutukhtu, the lamas there have so far refused to declare their support for him and the Buddyn Zövlöl. However, just this morning, many of the lamas of some of the main monasteries of Urga, including Gandantegchinlen Monastery, came out and declared their support for the Buddyn Zövlöl, stating that they are the only group who will keep Mongolian Buddhism safe."
mon.22.a:0 "Interesting."
mon.23.t:0 "Rebels bomb major buildings in Urga"
mon.23.d:0 "With the rebels being pushed back in the west, rebel groups have turned to other means. Just today, at around 6 in the morning, multiple bombs went off next to multiple major buildings in Urga. This includes multiple police buildings, the Russian Consulate and an arms factory. Of course, we will need to pay to repair these buildings, but as always the treasury is quite low."
mon.23.a:0 "The Nobles will pay."
mon.23.b:0 "The lamas will pay."
mon.23.c:0 "The peasants will pay."
mon.24.t:0 "Attacks on nobles in the streets of Urga"
mon.24.d:0 "The past few nights in Urga, there have been multiple attacks on nobles in Urga, mostly by the peasantry. This is an outrage to much of the aristocracy in Urga, making them not feel safe under the current leadership."
mon.24.a:0 "Interesting."
mon.25.t:0 "MAN support growing"
mon.25.d:0 "Political chaos has engulfed the capital for many weeks now. In all the chaos, the peasantry has been increasingly radicalised by the Mongol Ardīn Nam. Members travel the streets, trying to get the poor to support their cause, and it seems to be working very well."
mon.25.a:0 "Interesting."

mon.30.t:0 "Invasion of Tuva"
mon.30.d:0 "The forces that invaded Khem-Beldyr, though rather strong, seem to be getting supplies and reinforcements from a bandit outpost just north or Khovd. Though we could move directly into Khem-Beldyr to fight them head on, we also have the option to cut off their forces before attacking from all sides."
mon.30.a:0 "Move into Khem-Beldyr."
mon.30.b:0 "Cut off their forces."
mon.31.t:0 "Khem-Beldyr is taken"
mon.31.d:0 "When our troops finally got to Khem-Beldyr, the rebel force that met them was trivial. It was about half the size of the force that originally took the city. It appears the rebels had scouts, who saw our troops coming and lead to many rebels abandoning the city. Though this meant many rebels escaped, the fight was easy for us, and the city is now ours."
mon.31.a:0 "Perfectly executed."
mon.32.t:0 "The enemy is cut off"
mon.32.d:0 "By moving our forces to their supply lines and moving in from all sides before they were ready, we were able to fully attack and beat the entire rebel force. However, this was costly for us, as the relatively large force put up a good fight."
mon.32.a:0 "Worth it for victory."
mon.33.t:0 "Siege of Uliastai"
mon.33.d:0 "Now that we have amassed a large force of troops a couple miles away from Uliastai, it is time to take back the city. The question remains, however, how it is to be done."

mon.34.d:0 "What a success! With the city surrounded the bandits were forced to eventually try to escape, an escape that failed due to the strength of our force."
mon.34.a:0 "Exactly as planned."
mon.35.t:0 "Rebels escape Uliastai, leaving hundreds dead"
mon.35.d:0 "With the city surrounded, the bandits were forced to try to escape the city, which they eventually did as they were attacked by our troops. However, the rebels found a weak spot in our lines, and pushed through it, leaving many dead and the rebels having escaped."
mon.35.a:0 "At least we have the city back."
mon.36.t:0 "Rebels wiped out in Uliastai"
mon.36.d:0 "With our force moving head on into Uliastai, we were able to wipe the bandits out of Uliastai. However, in the crossfire, many civilians were killed."
mon.36.a:0 "At least we have the city back."
mon.37.t:0 "Rebels leave the city, but much of our force was lost"
mon.37.d:0 "When we attacked head on into the city, we did not at all expect the resistance we were going to face. A massive battle ensued, with many civilians caught in the crossfire. The city is in ruins, over a thousand dead, but at least the city is ours."
mon.37.a:0 "Good enough."
mon.38.t:0 "Rebels execute diplomat in Uliastai"
mon.38.d:0 "Earlier today, Togtokh Taij, leading the seige of Uliastai, recieved a package from the rebels in the city. It was expected this was to be a large sum of money with a request to leave them be and let them escape, or perhaps news of the success of our diplomat. Instead, when Togtokh Taij opened the box, all he found was the bloodied head of the diplomat, its dead eyes staring right back at him. Now, it is clear these rebels do not want a peaceful resolution."

mon.49.d:0 "After we were able to seize power of the government, Ungern and his loyal troops escaped. Now, after mustering his power in a village nearby, he and his troops are coming back to retake the city. His army, a mix of Mongols, Russians, and Chinese bandits number over a thousand troops. With most of the national army in the west, we only have the power of the civilians and the hastily established revolutionary militia to defend the city."
mon.49.a:0 "Call on civilians to resist, and march in the militia."

mon.51.t:0 "Ungern loyalists have captured Urga!"
mon.51.d:0 "After little fighting, Ungern and his troops were able to take back the city. Though most of our officials have escaped, we are unlikely to be seen as the real government without power in Urga."
mon.51.a:0 "Those men are more Russian than Mongolian."
mon.52.t:0 "Re-evaluation of Monastery funding"
mon.52.d:0 "With the power now in the people’s hands, and with Mongolia modernising every day, one key thing to evaluate is the funding the monasteries receive from the government. The monasteries, though an important aspect of Mongolia, is a very traditional area of the nation, and many lamas even push anti-government propaganda, either harbouring back to Ungerns Mongolia or even supporting the now defunct Buddyn Zövlöl. Some in our government state that funding for the monasteries should be reduced, for they harbour sentiments of authoritarianism and traditionalism. Others in government argue that for now, it might be best to keep the lamas on our side, and to leave the funding where it is, or even increase it."
mon.52.a:0 "Keep the Monasteries on our side."
mon.52.b:0 "Give the money to the people!"
mon.52.c:0 "The lamas may be a good ally, let's give them more funding."
mon.53.t:0 "The Popular Prince"
mon.53.d:0 "Ünenbayan was elected to government mostly thanks to assistance from the aristocrats. Now, discussions have begun throughout the party as to whether he is the right man to lead. Many people do not know him too well, and mostly see him as a noble bureaucrat, lacking much charisma. A figure of the aristocrats that does have charisma, however, is Prince Demchugdongrub. Following the Western Rebellion, the Prince and many of his aristocrats remained in Urga, to try to keep their influence. Demchugdongrub has remained a very popular figure, and many have stated he should rule as prime minister, with Ünenbayan as his deputy. Some, however, may see this as a betrayal of the democratic process."
mon.53.a:0 "Invite Demchugdongrub to become Prime Minister."
mon.53.b:0 "If he wants to lead, he can do it democratically!"
mon.54.t:0 "Review the Budget"
mon.54.d:0 "Throughout Ungerns years as dictator of Mongolia, spending increased massively. The country’s economy is weak, and changes must be made. Ungern began massive military projects, all of which cost massive amounts. We, the aristocrats, were taxed massively to pay the bill. Of course, aristocrat taxes have already been cut massively, and to offset this we could increase the tax on the poor majority of the nation, the arats. Perhaps, we could even begin a tax policy on the monasteries."
mon.54.a:0 "Cut military spending."
mon.54.b:0 "Raise Arat tax."
mon.54.c:0 "Implement Monastery tax."
mon.55.t:0 "Assassination attempt on Ungern-Sternberg!"
mon.55.d:0 "While riding his horse in a parade through Urga, a sudden noise deafened the crowds. A shot that echoed through the city, that missed Baron Ungern by two inches. The assassin, a twenty three year old man, was shot almost immediately. Ungern ordered the marching army to fire on the crowd, frenzied by the attempt on his life. The crowd dispersed in a panic as civilians, or possible MAN agents, were killed by Ungerns troops. After the city had calmed down, the assassin has been identified as a member of the Mongol Ardīn Nam, however many peasants in Urga claim this to be fabricated by our government. Though the Baron survived, this attempt showed weakness, and the chaos Ungern caused by killing the possible MAN agents can’t be good for our popularity."

mon.59.d:0 "Mongolia, lead by the religious zealot the [MON.GetLeader], has recently sent us a diplomatic mission. Due to both of our nations being major homes for buddhism, the Mongolian diplomats have stated that they wish to see our nations grow closer, through guarantees and military access. They await our answer."
mon.59.a:0 "We buddhist nations must stick together!"

mon.60.t:0 "The Western Rebellion has finally been crushed"
mon.60.d:0 "After many months of fighting in the west of the nation, between bandits, rebels, and government troops, the rebellion has been crushed. Most rebels have dispersed, gone into hiding or fled the country, fearing for their lives. Order has come out on top, and the country is secure. However, there are still some small bandit groups, taking advantage of the destruction. They will have to be dealt with."
mon.60.a:0 "At last, the nation is safe."
mon.61.t:0 "The Offer"
mon.61.d:0 "Today, we received a letter from a few of the bandit leaders in the west. In the letter, it said that their groups do not have any stake in what has developed. They came for simple banditry, but it has turned into all out rebellion. The letter goes on to say that although their groups continues to fight in the west, they would be willing to stop, if given some money and supplies. It is a large amount of money, which we will need to find, but it will help reduce the size of the chaos in the west."
mon.61.a:0 "Use the nobles money to pay the bribe."
mon.61.b:0 "Sell off some of the monasteries jewels to pay it."
mon.61.c:0 "Raise taxes on the poor to pay the bribe."

mon.61.f:0 "We will not negotiate with these bandits!"
mon.62.t:0 "The bandit leader takes the bribe"
mon.62.d:0 "The bandit leaders have taken our offer, and have decided to end their operations in the west. In these times of brutal battle, good news like this should be celebrated, but a quiet drink is all [MON.GetLeader] had time for, before having to return to keeping Urga in his hands."
mon.62.a:0 "That'll reduce their forces."
mon.63.t:0 "Mongolia asks for guarantees"
mon.63.d:0 "[MON.GetLeader], currently leader of Mongolia, has requested that we guarantee their nation, to keep them safe from outside threats. This will cement them as our influence in the region."
mon.63.a:0 "Guarantee them."

mon.65.a:0 "Damn."
mon.66.t:0 "Power Struggle in the Ma Clique"
mon.66.d:0 "For many years, the Ma Clique has been led by family elder Ma Fuxiang. In the Clique, he was seen as a pillar of stability, who would stop any power struggle occurring between the very divided Ma families. Many in China even see him as the stabiliser of the Northwest, ending Tibetan and our own aggression into Chinese soil.\n\nHowever, news has just reached us that Ma Fuxiang has passed away. Currently he has been replaced by Ma Lin, but another Ma, Ma Bufang, and Ma Lin are already embroiled in a power struggle. This could be a perfect opportunity to take advantage of the Ma Clique's position."
mon.66.a:0 "Good to know."
mon.67.t:0 "Damdinsüren gathers force on the Ulanqab border"
mon.67.d:0 "Mongolian general Buyandelger has generally stayed uninvolved with the power struggles happening currently in Urga. For years, he has continued to live in Inner Mongolia, raiding Chinese shipments through the region. Now, we have just received reports that Shouxin has gathered a large force on the border with the Ma Clique, likely to do some border raids into Ulanqab."
mon.67.a:0 "Let the border raids begin."
mon.68.t:0 "Mongolian border raids from Ulanqab"
mon.68.d:0 "Ever since the death of family patriarch Ma Fuxiang, tensions on both the northern and southern border have been getting worse and worse. Border Raids from Mongolia, primarily in the province of Ulanqab, have caused much chaos over the recent weeks. This is not wholly unexpected, though we should be prepared for if this escalates further."
mon.68.a:0 "This is fine."
mon.69.t:0 "Shouxin makes his choice"
mon.69.d:0 "With his large force moving through Ulanqab, a thought occurred to Shouxin. If he was to take Guisui, he would have de facto control of the province. With the Ma's struggling with internal conflict, it should not be too difficult to move his force through the region and to take the city. Now, it is whether he decides to do it or not."
mon.69.a:0 "It's too risky."
mon.69.b:0 "Shouxin, do it."
mon.70.t:0 "Large Mongolian force moving to Guisui"
mon.70.d:0 "Some of our scouts have reported a large force of Mongolian soldiers moving toward the main city of Ulanqab, Guisui. Should the Mongols take it, they will have de facto control of the whole region. Though there is a garrison in Guisui, many fear it will not be enough to beat the quickly approaching Mongols. Ma Hongkui is currently in the region with his force, so he may be able to fight them off."
mon.70.a:0 "The garrison will hold."
mon.70.b:0 "Send a force under Ma Hongkui."

There, he declared it now under Mongolian control. However, we can still act. Ma Hongbin is also now in the area, and could move his own forces up to try to retake the city."

Though he had to fight some small battles with border troops, and had to fight through the Guisui garrison, for now it seems the Ma Clique have retreated from Ulanqab. Finally, Mongolian families have been reunited, and Mongolian rule in the region has been restored."

mon.73.d:0 "Ma Hongkui's forces travelled for a day and a night to finally reach the Mongolian force. In the early hours of the morning, Ma Hongkui sent in his soldiers to attack the Mongolians, who looked like they were just camping. However, it was a trap! After Hongkui sent his main force in, a group of Mongolian cavalry had snuck behind and attacked on the back lines, at the same time as the battle going on at the front. Ma Hongkui's force was caught in the middle, and beaten. Hongkui was able to make his escape, but he lost the battle, and the Mongol force has almost reached Guisui."

mon.76.d:0 "Ma Hongbin decided to try to go for a full frontal attack against the Mongolian force with his own force, to avoid being scouted and routed by the Mongols. Therefore he charged directly at the city, but by that point he had already fallen into Shouxin's trap. From behind hills on both sides of his force emerged groups of Mongol cavalry, who pincered Hongbin's forces, leaving them with 2 options: either retreat and concede the city, or move into the city and try to take it, then deal with the outside cavalry afterwards. In this critical moment, Hongbin decided to push through to try to take the city. However, much of his force had already started to retreat, seeing the city as a death sentence. With that, Ma Hongbin's weakened group were forced to retreat. It seems Ulanqab has now fallen into Mongol hands."

This morning, when his maid came in to serve him breakfast, she dropped the tray in shock, as she saw a frail Ungern laying in his bed, covered in his own bloody vomit. Many monks and lamas were ordered in, bringing many herbs and other tribal remedies. However, it appears the Barons health is not getting much better."

As they entered the room, they saw Ungern’s body, face down on the ground, collapsed. Upon further inspection, they discovered he wasn’t breathing, and quickly rushed to find lamas to try to save him. Alas, it was too late for the Baron. The guards stationed outside his room were executed, for letting him die on their watch, as were many of the lamas who were there to cure him.\n\nWhile investigating the room, a short book was found, written by Ungern, detailing what would happen if he died. It was read to a council of Ungern’s inner circle: Boris Rezukhin, Mikhail Tornovsky, Ferdynand Ossendowski, Agvan Dorzhiev, and Vladimir Roerich. Also present was the powerless 9th Jebtsundamba Khutuktu. It stated that Rezukhin was Ungern’s successor, and that he must be protected so that he could rule in the Barons stead. Tornovsky refutes this, stating that he was Ungern’s rightful successor, but after Rezukhin pulled a pistol on him, he conceded. The book also stated stability of the realm was paramount, and that though Rezukhin will now rule, Baron Ungern-Sternberg will still be used in all propaganda, and his cult of personality will remain."

During his presidency, we were able to broker many economic and military deals, allowing our extremely weak economy to grow. Although Kerenskiy did not allow the House of Romanov to rightfully retake the throne, he was still better than the Reds, and he allowed our relationship to grow strong.\n\nHowever, everything has all been brought to question. Any sign of stability that Kerensky brought to Russian politics was lost the moment the bullet struck his body. With many trying to fill the power vacuum Kerenskiy has left, it seems we have been forgotten.

Both of the men held speeches in different areas in Urga, generally speaking about the same things: the lack of elections when they had been planned, and no issued date as to when the postponing of the elections will end. Both of them even compared us to the dictator Ungern-Sternberg! Ironic, seeing as the Ünenbayan's aristocratic friends were the ones helping keep the Baron's government alive. However, their reaction to this is unsurprising. What is surprising is the reaction of the people. It appears, though we were the most likely to win the election, it appears the people still wanted to be able to make the choice.

The beliefs of buddhism, something that Ungern claimed to follow, were noticeably absent in the previous government. The 1930 purge is evidence that Ungern's buddhist claims were little more than lies and deceptions. The Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu lived as little more than a prisoner, not receiving the proper training.

Anandyn Amar commands his own clique in the party, made up of less radical leftists and the stronger Mongol nationalists.

Danzan, of course, argued back that the transition was happening as fast as was possible, and that the left wing policies of Elbegdorj were dangerous for the party.

Thousands of people took to the streets and began looting pro-government shops and buildings, while violently attacking any police officer or soldier who opposed them. Toward the end of the day, with the riot having no sign of stopping, a cavalry battalion was called into the city, to put down the riot by any means necessary.

The soldiers were caught off guard, and were massacred. This triggered the beginning of a rebellion in Urga, led by Ünenbayan. His rebels are well armed, thanks to funding he secured through the nobles. No doubt this is merely a plot for the nobles to try to take power once again.

After surrounding the city, Damdinsüren's troops moved in and went street to street, clearing out the remaining rebels.\n\nBy evening it was all over. The streets of Urga were stained crimson, with the blood of hundreds of rebels and civilians alike. However, though sadness reigned over most of the city, the State Great Khural was very different.

This government wishes to try to divide Mongolians in a weak attempt to weaken our resolve. However, we will not let this stand. It is time for us to march!\"This speech, held in the outskirts of Urga to a massive crowd, received much applause and cheers from the people watching.

I can confirm that I was in no way involved in the planning of this attack, and I pray for the swift recovery for anyone injured in the attack. Not only was I not involved in this, I declare now that this act of terror was committed by the government itself, to try to give legitimacy to their cancellation of elections.

The acts of violence caused by the MLN are level with the pains the current MAN government have caused to all Mongolians. Both the MLN under Tseveen and the MAN under [MON.GetLeader] are evil groups, who seek to destroy any order and peace the nation has, and replace them with bloody syndicalist revolution.\"\n\nIronically, this statement has proven very unpopular, with government supporters claiming that Ünenbayan only works for himself, and MLN supporters claiming Ünenbayan has betrayed them.

While doing this, he has only taken a small force of men with him, and has left the rest of his supporters in Urga. We must act on this, and this leaves us with a choice. Either we can try to root out the rebels in the city while Tseveen in away, or we can send out a group of men to attack Tseveen while his supporters remain in Urga.

His party was only 25 men strong, and when they were met with a group of 200 government troops, they were extremely unprepared. While most of Tseveen's men were sleeping, out troops took positions and fired as one, killing most of his men almost immediately. The rest, including Tseveen, surrendered before they were gunned down too. The men were arrested and brought back to Urga, where they will live in a prison cell for the rest of their lives."

mon.163.d:0 "After giving the order for investigations, a large group of soldiers numbering around 200 were tasked with going through every person in Urga to root out the rebels. However, it seems this move was not exactly popular with the population. The soldiers did small investigations on many people in Urga, and if they deemed them to be rebels, either arrested them or lined them up and shot them without trial. After doing this through part of Urga, the people in the city began to resist them. Civilians began to throw rocks at the soldiers, and were met with bullets. This quickly led to massive riots throughout Urga, primarily lead by armed MLN insurgents."

mon.164.t:0 "Massacre in Urga"

Starting in upper Urga, the battalion battled hard with rioting civilians and MLN insurgents alike, and both sides took substantial losses. It wasn't until the battalion began to move that things turned for the worst. While travelling through the middle of Urga, the battalion were very quickly surrounded by armed MLN insurgents, who opened fire on the troops. Whenever a rebel was killed, another came in to take his place. Casualties for the rebels were very high, however, they had won the day. All the soldiers in the battalion were lost, and so the group, lead by the now returned Tseveen, moved in to take the State Great Khural."
mon.164.a:0 "The rebellion has succeeded."
mon.165.t:0 "Tseveen takes over the government"
mon.165.d:0 "After fighting off the remaining guards of the State Great Khural, Tseveen took his place as Prime Minister. [MON.GetLeader] was arrested, along with multiple other major MAN players.

mon.165.a:0 "Freedom wins in Mongolia."
mon.166.t:0 "Tseveen demands elections and arrests of many MAN members"
mon.166.d:0 "After releasing a statement that we would be prepared for talks with the MLN rebels, Tseveen has released a new statement:\n\n\"We decline your offer for talks with us. It is not talks we need. Talks would lead to small concessions which allow you to subvert the democratic process. Instead, we have made a list of demands. If these demands are followed, then the revolution will end. \n1. Elections must be scheduled as soon as possible.\n2. The arrests of the perpetrators who lead to this situation, primarily [MON.GetLeader].\n3. The freedom for any rebels who have been arrested during the past few weeks.\n4. Justice served to those soldiers who carelessly killed innocent civilians.\n5. The acknowledgement by the MAN that this revolution was caused by their undemocratic actions.\""

mon.170.d:0 "After finally securing control of Mongolia, [MON.GetLeader] made a speech outside the State Great Khural, promising many things, including the redistribution of wealth, a new constitution, and democratic elections. In the following months since, the government has worked hard to set right the injustices caused by the previous government. The peasants now finally feel like they truly have power, and do not work as slaves.\n\nOver the past few weeks, the government has been working on the second promise. Over the period of multiple weeks, full of long meetings and heated arguments, the new constitution has been drafted. This constitution sets out the government form, with the Jebtsundamba Khutukhtu as the figurehead leader of the nation once he comes of age, with much power in the hands of the working class, through voting for the Prime Minister and his government. It also includes points about human and workers rights, and ensures universal suffrage.\n\nWith celebrations of the new constitution echoing through Urga, we must now focus on the last of [MON.GetLeader]'s promises: elections."

mon.172.d:0 "Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren has fought on the side of Mongolia for decades, taking part in Mongolian independence back in 1911. Though he opened dialogue with the MAN rebels at the time, he was arrested by the Chinese, and almost died in his cell. He would have died had it not been for Ungern's Asiatic Cavalry Division taking Urga from Chinese control and freeing him. Many Mongolians see the old man as a unifying figure; a sign that Mongolians are still able to lead in this Russian-dominated government. However, perhaps his links to the MAN never went away. Though we have failed to find any evidence of this, perhaps he aided the MAN rebels against us, and almost led to our downfall. He constantly makes it clear that he doesn't serve us, rather serving Mongolia directly. Maybe it is time for the old General to meet his end."
mon.172.a:0 "He is trustworthy."

mon.173.t:0 "Status of Nikolay Kazagrandi"
mon.173.d:0 "Nikolay Kazagrandi has been working under Ungern-Sternberg after he left Siberia during the Russian Civil War. Ungern almost had him purged back then, but his high skill during the 1921 MAN Revolution made Ungern let him stay. After that, he travelled to the west of the nation, to put down rebellion and to train anti-Chinese forces in the province of Dzungaria. It is clear that in this mission he failed. At the start of the Western Rebellion, he was in Dzungaria, rather than doing his job of putting down anti-government activity. Ungerns mistrust of him was obviously justified. However, will his skill save him from being purged this time?"
mon.173.a:0 "He is trustworthy."

mon.174.t:0 "Status of Togtokh Taij"
mon.174.d:0 "Togtokh Taij's situation is similar to that of Manlaibaatar Damdinsüren. The old man formed an anti-Chinese guerrilla group in Inner Mongolia in 1907, for which he became a Mongolian hero. He was promoted to the rank of general by the Bogd Khan himself, after he came to Urga following the revolution against the Chinese. In expelling Chinese troops, he worked with bandit leader Ja Lama multiple times. This is where the worry about Togtokh Taij lies. It was Ja Lamas Yum-Beise bandits who sparked the start of the Western Rebellion just months ago. Perhaps Togtokh Taij organised the bandits into rebelling, so that he could gain power for himself."
mon.174.a:0 "He is trustworthy."
mon.174.b:0 "End him."
mon.175.t:0 "Status of the Officers"
mon.175.d:0 "The officer class have proven their disloyalty over the past few months. With many officers deciding to align themselves with the opposing rebel groups, it is clear many of their loyalties do not sit with us. Perhaps it is time for the officer class to be cleansed of anyone who dared declare themselves for an opposing faction."
mon.175.a:0 "They are fine."
mon.175.b:0 "They must be cleansed."
mon.176.t:0 "Status of Altanochir"
mon.176.d:0 "Altanochir is a prince from Inner Mongolia, who only very recently travelled to Urga from Inner Mongolia, after recommendation from Prince Demchugdongrub. It should already be clear as to why he is on the chopping block. Demchugdongrub pushed to gain power during the chaos of the Western Rebellion. It was his clique of princes and nobles who almost led to our downfall. Altanochir, still being quite a low level military leader, should be an obvious one to be purged."

mon.178.t:0 "37 People Die in Factory Explosion"
mon.178.d:0 "Following Ungern's new policy of Aggressive Industrialisation, construction of new factories, sponsored mostly by Russian businessmen, sprung up across the nation. With this new mass industrialisation along with the complete lack of labour rights, all of the workers constructing these factories are in clear danger. A common cause of death nowadays is death while constructing a new factory. The best example of this occurred today, when 37 people were killed in an explosion during the construction of a factory outside Mörön. The factory is to become a textile factory, owned personally by Boris Rezukhin, Ungern's right hand man. Due to the lack of any safety regulations whatsoever, a poorly build bit of construction machinery failed, causing a fire which led to the explosion. Rezukhin commented that it was the fault of the workers doing poor work, a statement Ungern agreed with."

mon.179.t:0 "Mongol Ardīn Nam Cell Destroyed near the Russian Border"
mon.179.d:0 "After receiving information from one of our informants placed in the MAN, we learned the location of a major MAN cell, just on the Russo-Mongolian border. So, under the command of Boris Rezukhin, a battalion was sent out from Urga up north to the location. After travelling and searching for a few days, they eventually found it. A large complex of gers of all sizes, surrounded by a quickly put up wooden fence. Patrols of men armed with rifles and wearing MAN symbols on their caps travelled around the complex every few minutes. It is clear that the camp is struggling to keep together, following the failure of their now third revolution. After surrounding the camp, Rezukhin moved his troops in, and took the complex. There was a small firefight, but nothing major; it seems most of their actual fighting soldiers died during the revolution. Rezukhin rounded up everyone else that was left, primarily older men or women, and either shot them there or took them in for questioning. After going through all the papers in the gers, the locations of multiple, smaller MAN cells were discovered, as well as some of their future plans which included a plan to assassinate Ungern-Sternberg. After getting all the decent information out of the area, Rezukhin burned the complex to the ground, and brought back his prisoners for questioning through out secret police."

Many of them claim that they do not serve Ungern, but rather serve the nation of Mongolia. However, what they fail to see is that these are one in the same. For this betrayal, these soldiers have been imprisoned, so that they cannot spread dissent against us."

mon.181.d:0 "Many of the rich nobles and princes of Mongolia have their own guard with them at all times, almost like a private army. After hearing that they were going to have their lands seized to be distributed to the populus, a few princes decided to unite their guards to protect their lands. After refusing to cede their land to the government, the newly created Mongolian Revolutionary Army were sent in, under the leadership of Dansranbilegiin Dogsom. After approaching the princes lands once again, the princes guard stood firm, and refused to allow the MRA in. Dogsom said that they had the choice now to either surrender now or face death. Though a handful of guards put down their arms and were let go, the vast majority stood their ground and refused to move. With that, Dogsom gave the command to open fire. The princes guard put up a strong fight, but they were eventually beaten by the MRA. The few that remained surrendered and were arrested, as were the princes whose troops they were."

mon.425.t:0 "Agvan Dorzhiev patronized by Ungern"
mon.425.d:0 "An estranged friend of the 13th Dalai Lama, Agvan Dorzhiev, has arrived in Urga to meet with Ungern. Agvan has presented Ungern with a Kalachakra tantra reportedly written by the late 13th Dalai Lama proclaiming the deceased Tsar Nicholas as the Ārya Tārā, the White Tara. This evidence appears to Ungern as validation for his monarchistic beliefs, and the two have stuck up a strong friendship. Although Agvan's influence has been reduced by the Regency, this friendship will undoubtedly bring Ungern's regime closer to buddhist theologians."

Chet has organized Buryat churches in order to revoke Buddhism in the land of our ancestors, and is oppressing our history with his claims that the Oirat will be liberated by some white savior. This is obviously referring to the great Baron Ungern himself, and so Ungern's officers suggest inviting Chet to Urga to preach his message of hope.\nThou peopling within thyself, in gold and silver, A nation, White Altai! Thou who illuminest the day— Sun—Burkhan! Thou who illuminest the night— Moon—Burkhan! "

It is essential that we recall the relics of Ejin Horo's memorial to Urga, in order to safeguard them from treasure seekers. It is already rumored that the vicious warlords of the south have plundered tombs of lesser emperors and disgraced their names in their own vain bids for immortal fame.

It appears that the family of the Shah of Kumul had wrestled the relics of Chinggis Khaan from their first buyers, and have claimed it as their own owing to their Chagatai legacy. This offense done by the muslims would have resulted in war, if not for the diplomatic grace of [MON.GetLeader]. For a very large fee, the relics of Chinggis Khaan are recovered finally, and the Shah's family compensated more than adequately."

Long have the banners opposed any political influence of Islam in Inner Mongolia, and until now no institution dared to challenge us in this regard. But coming out of Shanyang are pamphlets called 'Japan's Herald' written in Arabic and chinese calling for muslims to emigrate to Fengtian, promising them a return and holy victory against Buddhism. This is just the threat the Kalachakra tantra predicted, and it is our duty to find and capture the Imam advocating for this apocalyptic conflict."

The Imam was apprehended by our agents after a mysterious man in Shanyang, Vladimir Roerich, tipped us off. It appears that this Imam was a former ally of Baron Ungern to boot, which only reinforces the idea that Baron Ungern cared not for us Buddhists. The imam Kurbangaliev shall be detained indefinitely, and hopefully the Japanese cannot find another such as him to do their dirty work. Vladimir Roerich has been well compensated and we hope his Tri-Artel Commune continues to help the beleaguered in Shenyang."

[MON.GetLeader] was ready to approve of his study, only to be stopped by a minister with one of Barchenko's other papers.

mon.600.t:0 "The Current Situation"
mon.600.d:0 "In 1936, Mongolia is in a dangerous place. Ungern was able to negotiate many treaties of friendship and of support from Russia, allowing him to keep his leadership secure. However, he is faced by many opponents. The Buddyn Zövlöl has large strength in government, and many of the aristocrats grow tired of the many taxes Ungern is making them pay to keep the nation afloat. Also, the Mongol Ardīn Nam, although in hiding, remain active and recruiting. Should Russian support suddenly cease, many people in Mongolia might see it as time to end the rule of Ungern.\n\nHowever, Mongolia's threats are not only internal. For many years now, border skirmishes have gone on endlessly between Mongolian and Ma Clique troops. Much of Inner Mongolia is under the Ma's control, and they know their power there is under threat. The border between the Ma Clique and Tibet is in a similar situation. Yushu Province has been taken and taken back multiple times over the years, but for now it sits under Ma control. However, with tension growing in the area once again, it looks like we may have an opportunity to step in and end Ma control in Inner Mongolia."

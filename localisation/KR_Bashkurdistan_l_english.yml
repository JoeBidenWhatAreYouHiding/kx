A strong and powerful neighbor, even weakened by the civil war, was once again able to subjugate the free Turkic-speaking peoples, and Akhmet-Zaki Validi is the main proponent of this bitter loss and the need for the Bashkirs to take control of their people and state into their own hands. In alliance with the Turkestan's pan-Turkists, the new ERK movement, or 'Will', seeks to bring not only freedom and prosperity to Bashkurdistan, but to all Turkic peoples, but only in an Internationale that values the rights and freedoms of small peoples over indulging in Russia's new socialist imperialism.§!"

### Events ###
bkn.1.t: "Bashkir National Autonomy"
bkn.1.d: "After the February Revolution of 1917, the Bashkir national movement strongly advocated national-territorial autonomy. The First and Second All-Bashkir Congresses, held in Orenburg and Ufa in July-August 1917, laid the groundwork for the creation of a \"democratic republic on national-territorial principles within federal Russia\". The Bashkir Central Shuro, elected at these congresses, worked to prepare the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. However, the October Revolution brought unforeseen changes.\n\nAlthough the Bashkir movement was recognized as legitimate, the Soviet leadership refused to recognize Bashkir autonomy despite attempts to gain recognition from the central authorities. The situation escalated, resulting in the arrest of seven members of the Bashkir government and the Bashkir Central Shuro on the night of February 3-4, 1918. In response to the arrests, Bashkir youth, together with members of the Tulqyn organization, formed the Provisional Revolutionary Council of Bashkiristan (VRSB). The Soviets, however, condemned the idea of national autonomy and dissolved the VRSB. Red Guard actions to confiscate weapons often resulted in violence. In April 1918, united Bashkir and Cossack detachments freed members of the Bashkir government from Orenburg prison, and at a secret meeting in Ufa it was decided to organize a partisan movement.\n\nAt the end of May 1918, the Bashkir authorities regrouped in Chelyabinsk after the city was captured by the Czechoslovak legion. The Bashkir government called for armed resistance to Soviet power. Bashkir regiments were mobilized, and the Bashkir Military Council was established to direct the Bashkir army. Faced with an order from Kolchak's government to dissolve local authorities and transfer administration, the Bashkir government refused to surrender and split over whether to support Kolchak or the Soviets. Facing persecution, Bashkir leaders fled Bashkiria and Russia. Some, such as Shärif Manatov, found refuge in Paris, while others, including Ähmätzäki Välidi, found refuge in Turkestan.\n\nNow, amid the chaos of Russia's new civil war, the exiled separatist leaders have returned, determined to achieve the autonomy they once sought."
bkn.1.a: "Irekle Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.2.t: "The Bashkir Military Council"
bkn.2.d: "Amidst the ongoing second Russian Civil War, the situation in Bashkurdistan is becoming increasingly complex. The local parliaments and councils of major industrial cities, such as Ufa, are now dominated by workers and peasants of Russian origin. However, a new center of power emerged in the Southern Urals, known as 'Little Bashkiria'. General Ğalimyän Tağan led the charge in establishing the Bashqort Härbi Shurahy (Bashkir Military Council), which serves as both the provisional government and the General Staff of the revived Bashkir Host. The local milita forces managed to swiftly gain control over key cities and villages in the region\n\nThe main goal of the Bashqort Härbi Shurahy, centered in the town of Qyzyl Machet (Mrakovo) is to protect Bashkir interests and achieve independence despite the opposing forces. Now, as Tağan has solidified his power as a provisional dictator, he aims to capture Sterlitamak and Belebey, which are located on the opposite bank of the Ağeđil (Belaya) River."
bkn.2.a: "All of Bashkurdistan will be ours!"

bkn.3.t: "Liberation of Sterlitamak and Belebey"
bkn.3.d: "In a decisive move the Härbi Shurahy orchestrates a triumphant liberation campaign. Focused on reclaiming territories, the Bashkir forces, led by General Ğalimyän Tağan himself, employ strategic brilliance to swiftly advance, gaining control over strategic points and rallying local support. As news of the victories spreads, the momentum of the Bashkir autonomy movement gains strength, setting the stage for the most serious battle - battle for Ufa."
bkn.3.a: "Another victory for the just cause!"

bkn.4.t: "Occupation of Sterlitamak and Belebey"
bkn.4.d: "The so-called Bashkir Military Council has launched a determined campaign to reclaim what they view as Bashkir core territories. The focus of their attention shifts to the strategic cities of Sterlitamak and Belebey. In a swift and coordinated offensive, the Bashkir forces, under the leadership of General Ğalimyän Tağan, strategically advance, gaining control over key points and rallying local support. The streets, once under our jurisdiction, now echo with the triumphant cheers of the Bashkir population as they witness the capture of Sterlitamak and Belebey. The provisional administrations established by the Bashqort Härbi Shurahy signal the swift transition to a Bashkir-centric governance structure. The Russian Socialist Republic, now facing setbacks in the region, grapples with the implications of losing control over these key cities. The defiance of the Bashkir forces not only secures strategic points but also inspires a surge of hope and momentum within the Bashkir autonomy movement, which can be a dangerous signal for us."
bkn.4.a: "Damn."

bkn.5.t: "The Danger of Siege"
bkn.5.d: "With the capture of the key cities of Sterlitamak and Belebey, the main blow of our new-found army will come to Ufa - our legitimate capital. However, since the city lies mostly between the rivers Belaya and Ufa, it will not be easy to take it. It is probable that we shall face a rather long siege, but there is some good news - although the power in the city belongs to the newly created Council of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies, their leader is Shärif Manatov, and we know that despite the socialist views that are inherent in our government, he and his Irek Party stand for the independence of the Bashkir people. Perhaps we should start secret negotiations and we can induce him to side with our government and then we can wrest Ufa from the Red Guards without too much effort."
bkn.5.a: "Let's try to get them on our side"
bkn.5.b: "No negotiations with socialists!"

bkn.6.t: "Irek Joins Our Ranks!"
bkn.6.t2: "Treason of Manatov!"
bkn.6.d: ""
bkn.6.a: "Hozaybirzin stands no chance!"
bkn.6.b: "Expectedly, Manatov was a traitor."

bkn.7.t: "Irek Splits On the Issue of Allegiance"
bkn.7.d: ""
bkn.7.a: "A partial victory, at least."
bkn.7.b: "How can we trust them after this?"

bkn.8.t: "Failure of the Negotiations"
bkn.8.d: ""
bkn.8.a: "The people of Bashkurdistan now know traitors in face."

bkn.9.t: "Ğalimyän Tağan Assassinated!"
bkn.9.d: ""

bkn.10.t: "Siege of Ufa"
bkn.10.d: "With the Bashkir separatists capturing key cities of Sterlitamak and Belebey, the main blow of their forces will come to Ufa. However, since the city lies mostly between the rivers Belaya and Ufa, it will not be easy to take it. The city is now under our control, with the local Soviets under the leadership of Sharif Manatov. However, despite his socialist views, he and his Irek Party stand for the independence of the Bashkir people. While now he is on our side, there are rumors that he is not a very reliable ally. There's also some members of the Russian Muslim Communist Party, a pro-Bolshevik force, active in the town, that clearly state their autonomist views and are radically against the Bashkir nationalists in Mrakovo. We should get ready for the siege and make sure that the city shall not fall to the separatists!"
bkn.10.a: "Ufa shall not fall!"

bkn.11.t: "Ähmätzäki Välidi Returns from Turkestan"
bkn.11.d: "The recognized leader of the Bashkir people and a proponent of united Turkestan, leader of the ERK party, Ähmätzäki Välidi has returned to his homeland after decades of exile. Today, in Qyzyl Machet, he delivered a speech to the people that Bashkurdistan will become a part of the united state of all Turk people. He also denounced the bloody Russian regime, who is holding Ufa and prevents Bashkir people from achieving their long-awaited sovereignty. He also expressed support to the Härbi Shurahy and Ğalimyän Tağan, though voicing his opinion that as soon as Ufa returns under the Bashkir control, a new democratically elected Qurultai should be convened to truly represent the people."
bkn.11.a: "Our natural ally in the upcoming struggle."

bkn.12.t: "Ähmätzäki Välidi Leaves for Bashkurdistan"
bkn.12.d: "The recognized leader of the Bashkir people, Ähmätzäki Välidi, has recently left our country in his struggle for independent Bashkurdistan. Before leaving, he delivered a fairwell speech to the people in Tashkent, stating that Bashkurdistan will achieve its sovereignty and join forces with Turkestan in its struggle."
bkn.12.a: "Hopefully, he will succeed there."

bkn.13.t: "Fall of Ufa!"
bkn.13.d: "Thanks to our preparedness and the failure of Ufa defense, the Harbi Shurahy forces managed to succesfully surrond the city. After several weeks of siege, the Ufa 'defenders' have finally given up, opening our way to liberate the city from the Russians. A lot of people on the streets, mainly of Bashkir origin, were happy to greet their liberators. With the capital city of our great nation finally under our control, we must get ready for the war with anyone who will try to subdue us."
bkn.13.a: "Long live free Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.14.t: "Fall of Ufa!"
bkn.14.d: "Unfortunately for us, the siege of Ufa became a complete failure for the Red Guards and local councils. The nationalists of Galimyan Tagan managed to capture the city and occupy much of the Ufa region, declaring their victory. While our remaining troops were forced to flee from Bashkiria, we will return and all traitors of revolution will pay for their mistakes."
bkn.14.a: "They can be happy, but not for too long."

bkn.15.t: "The Battle Lost!"
bkn.15.d: "Unfortunately, the Ufa 'defenders' managed to hold the city and wait for reinforcements from Moscow. After several weeks of siege, their morale was strong. Due to our strategical mistakes, they managed to spread propaganda that we want to completely destroy the city with air bombings and artillery, turning the citizens against us. This misinformation has also spread beyond Ufa, as workers of Sterlitamak have also rebelled and seized control of the city. After a couple of days the socialists managed to take back all our recent conquers. The initiative is now clearly on their side and Harbi Shurahy has announced that it will continue the struggle mostly underground and initiate a partisan warfare. After the loss of Sterlitamak, the Urals followed. While Qyzyl Machet remains our stronghold, it is unknown for how much longer can we hold it."
bkn.15.a: "Long live Soviet Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.16.t: "Crackdown on Nationalists"
bkn.16.d: "Due to our preparedness to a bloody siege of Ufa, the local Soviets have managed to hold the city and even more - after the nationalists were forced to flee Ufa outskirts, the counter-offensive began with great success. Cities of Belebey and Sterlitamak were seized with the help of local workers and much of the Southern Urals were also liberated. While nationalists were forced to go underground and remain control of Qyzyl Machet, they are almost certainly doomed."

bkn.17.t: "Ties With [RVA.GetName]"
bkn.17.d: "While we are ready to fight for our independence, no doubt our main enemies are in [RUS.Capital.GetName], while those who oppose them are our friends. The government of General [RVA.GetLeader] in [RVA.Capital.GetName] is not the best choice, their troops bordering vital city of Sterlitamak, can really help us.\n\n[ROOT.GetName] suggests that we send a delegation to [RVA.GetNameDef] and try to sign a cooperation agreement with them for the sake of acquiring our ancestral lands, but in return we will have to offer them something. One way or another, while the civil war is raging in the rest of Russia, we will be able to get our lands and prepare an army"
bkn.17.a: "Send a delegation to [RVA.Capital.GetName]"
bkn.17.b: "It's a waste of time!"

bkn.18.t: "Delegation From Bashkirs"
bkn.18.d: "Today, a delegation from the Bashkir national government was sent to our general Staff - in fact, separatist, but in need of our help to capture Sterlitamak and Ufa. In return, the Bashkirs promised to recognize the legitimacy of our government.\n\nAlthough a number of high-ranking generals and officials intend to reject this audacious proposal, while the Bashkirs do not fully obey us, some more progressive commanders recognize that collaborating with the Bashkir forces in an offensive operation against Sterlitamak, followed by the temporary transfer of certain territories to their use, could secure one of our fronts and allow us to focus on crossing the Volga and seizing its right bank."
bkn.18.a: "Reject these miserable terms!"
bkn.18.b: "March on Sterlitamak and give it to Bashkirs after capturing."

bkn.19.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees"
bkn.19.d: "Fortunately, the general [RVA.GetLeader]'s administration has acceded to our proposal, and a cooperative agreement has been concluded between us. In the not-too-distant future, our forces will be prepared to launch a joint offensive against Sterlitamak, with the aim of liberating it from the duplicitous Soviet regime."
bkn.19.a: "If successful, Sterlitamak will be in our possession."

bkn.20.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused"
bkn.20.d: "Alas or alack, the administration of General [RVA.GetLeader] has declined our proposal. Consequently, Sterlitamak remains in the possession of the renegade Manatov for the time being. Nonetheless, our leadership maintains confidence that this state of affairs will not persist, and this incident serves as yet another indication of our divergence from the path of unity with any Russia."
bkn.20.a: "Bashkurdistan shall be free!"

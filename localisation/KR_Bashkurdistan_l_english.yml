By establishing a specialized department near the mountains, where officers will be selected for training, and by selecting local soldiers, as well as by conducting an active campaign to attract the local population to the mountain units, we expect to create 2 regiments. In addition, we are introducing basic mountain operations vision lessons into the standard officer training courses."

Bashkurdistan does not have the luxury of spending resources inefficiently, literally one strategic mistake (supply is of strategic importance) can cost our homeland its independence, and we must never allow this to happen again!"

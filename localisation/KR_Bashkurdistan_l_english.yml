In alliance with the Turkestan's pan-Turkists, the new ERK movement, or 'Will', seeks to bring not only freedom and prosperity to Bashkurdistan, but to all Turkic peoples, but only in an Internationale that values the rights and freedoms of small peoples over indulging in Russia's new socialist imperialism.§!"

bkn.1.t: "Bashkir National Autonomy"
bkn.1.d: "After the February Revolution of 1917, the Bashkir national movement strongly advocated national-territorial autonomy. The First and Second All-Bashkir Congresses, held in Orenburg and Ufa in July-August 1917, laid the groundwork for the creation of a \"democratic republic on national-territorial principles within federal Russia\". The Bashkir Central Shuro, elected at these congresses, worked to prepare the All-Russian Constituent Assembly. However, the October Revolution brought unforeseen changes.\n\nAlthough the Bashkir movement was recognized as legitimate, the Soviet leadership refused to recognize Bashkir autonomy despite attempts to gain recognition from the central authorities. The situation escalated, resulting in the arrest of seven members of the Bashkir government and the Bashkir Central Shuro on the night of February 3-4, 1918. In response to the arrests, Bashkir youth, together with members of the Tulqyn organization, formed the Provisional Revolutionary Council of Bashkurdistan (VRSB). The Soviets, however, condemned the idea of national autonomy and dissolved the VRSB. Red Guard actions to confiscate weapons often resulted in violence. In April 1918, united Bashkir and Cossack detachments freed members of the Bashkir government from Orenburg prison, and at a secret meeting in Ufa it was decided to organize a partisan movement.\n\nAt the end of May 1918, the Bashkir authorities regrouped in Chelyabinsk after the city was captured by the Czechoslovak legion. The Bashkir government called for armed resistance to Soviet power. Bashkir regiments were mobilized, and the Bashkir Military Council was established to direct the Bashkir army. Faced with an order from Kolchak's government to dissolve local authorities and transfer administration, the Bashkir government refused to surrender and split over whether to support Kolchak or the Soviets. Facing persecution, Bashkir leaders fled Bashkiria and Russia. Some, such as Shärif Manatov, found refuge in Paris, while others, including Ähmätzäki Välidi, found refuge in Turkestan.\n\nNow, amid the chaos of Russia's new civil war, the exiled separatist leaders have returned, determined to achieve the autonomy they once sought."
bkn.1.a: "Irekle Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.2.t: "The Bashkir Military Council"
bkn.2.d: "Amidst the ongoing second Russian Civil War, the situation in Bashkurdistan is becoming increasingly complex. The local parliaments and councils of major industrial cities, such as Ufa, are now dominated by workers and peasants of Russian origin. However, a new center of power emerged in the Southern Urals, known as 'Little Bashkiria'. General Ğalimyän Tağan led the charge in establishing the Bashqort Härbi Shurahy (Bashkir Military Council), which serves as both the provisional government and the General Staff of the revived Bashkir Host. The local milita forces managed to swiftly gain control over key cities and villages in the region\n\nThe main goal of the Bashqort Härbi Shurahy, centered in the town of Qyzyl Machet (Mrakovo) is to protect Bashkir interests and achieve independence despite the opposing forces. Now, as Tağan has solidified his power as a provisional dictator, he aims to capture Sterlitamak and Belebey, which are located on the opposite bank of the Ağeđil (Belaya) River."
bkn.2.a: "All of Bashkurdistan will be ours!"

bkn.3.t: "Liberation of Sterlitamak and Belebey"
bkn.3.d: "In a decisive move the Härbi Shurahy orchestrates a triumphant liberation campaign. Focused on reclaiming territories, the Bashkir forces, led by General Ğalimyän Tağan himself, employ strategic brilliance to swiftly advance, gaining control over strategic points and rallying local support. As news of the victories spreads, the momentum of the Bashkir autonomy movement gains strength, setting the stage for the most serious battle - battle for Ufa."
bkn.3.a: "Another victory for the just cause!"

bkn.4.t: "Occupation of Sterlitamak and Belebey"
bkn.4.d: "The so-called Bashkir Military Council has launched a determined campaign to reclaim what they view as Bashkir core territories. In a swift and coordinated offensive, the Bashkir forces, under the leadership of General Ğalimyän Tağan, strategically advance, gaining control over Sterlitamak and Belebey, and rallying local support. The defiance of the Bashkir forces not only secures strategic points but also inspires a surge of hope and momentum within the Bashkir separatist movement, which can be a dangerous signal for us."
bkn.4.a: "Damn."

bkn.5.t: "The Danger of Siege"
bkn.5.d: "With the capture of the key cities of Sterlitamak and Belebey, the main blow of our new-found army will come to Ufa - our legitimate capital. However, since the city lies mostly between the rivers Belaya and Ufa, it will not be easy to take it. It is probable that we shall face a rather long siege, but there is some good news - although the power in the city belongs to the newly created Council of Workers' and Peasants' Deputies, their leader is Shärif Manatov, and we know that despite the socialist views that are inherent in our government, he and his Irek Party stand for the independence of the Bashkir people. Perhaps we should start secret negotiations and we can induce him to side with our government and then we can wrest Ufa from the Red Guards without too much effort."
bkn.5.a: "Let's try to get them on our side"
bkn.5.b: "No negotiations with socialists!"

bkn.9.t: "Ğalimyän Tağan Assassinated!"
bkn.9.d: ""

bkn.10.t: "Siege of Ufa"
bkn.10.d: "With the Bashkir separatists capturing key cities of Sterlitamak and Belebey, the main blow of their forces will come to Ufa. However, since the city lies mostly between the rivers Belaya and Ufa, it will not be easy to take it. The city is now under our control, with the local Soviets under the leadership of Sharif Manatov. However, despite his socialist views, he and his Irek Party stand for the independence of the Bashkir people. While now he is on our side, there are rumors that he is not a very reliable ally. There's also some members of the former Russian Muslim Communist Party, a pro-Bolshevik force, active in the town, that clearly state their autonomist views and are radically against the Bashkir nationalists in Mrakovo. We should get ready for the siege and make sure that the city shall not fall to the separatists!"
bkn.10.a: "Ufa shall not fall!"

bkn.11.t: "Ähmätzäki Välidi Returns from Turkestan"
bkn.11.d: "The recognized leader of the Bashkir people and a proponent of united Turkestan, leader of the ERK party, Ähmätzäki Välidi has returned to his homeland after decades of exile. Today, in Qyzyl Machet, he delivered a speech to the people that Bashkurdistan will become a part of the united state of all Turk people. He also denounced the bloody Russian regime, who is holding Ufa and prevents Bashkir people from achieving their long-awaited sovereignty. He also expressed support to the Härbi Shurahy and Ğalimyän Tağan, though voicing his opinion that as soon as Ufa returns under the Bashkir control, a new democratically elected Qoroltay should be convened to truly represent the people."
bkn.11.a: "Our natural ally in the upcoming struggle."

bkn.12.t: "Ähmätzäki Välidi Leaves for Bashkurdistan"
bkn.12.d: "The recognized leader of the Bashkir people, Ähmätzäki Välidi, has recently left our country in his struggle for independent Bashkurdistan. Before leaving, he delivered a fairwell speech to the people in Tashkent, stating that Bashkurdistan will achieve its sovereignty and join forces with Turkestan in its struggle."
bkn.12.a: "Hopefully, he will succeed there."

bkn.13.t: "Fall of Ufa!"
bkn.13.d: "Thanks to our preparedness and the failure of Ufa defense, the Härbi Shurahy forces managed to succesfully surrond the city. After several weeks of siege, the Ufa 'defenders' have finally given up, opening our way to liberate the city from the Russians. A lot of people on the streets, mainly of Bashkir origin, were happy to greet their liberators. With the capital city of our great nation finally under our control, we must get ready for the war with anyone who will try to subdue us."
bkn.13.a: "Long live free Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.14.t: "Fall of Ufa!"
bkn.14.d: "Unfortunately for us, the siege of Ufa became a complete failure for the Red Guards and local councils. The nationalists of Galimyan Tagan managed to capture the city and occupy much of the Ufa region, declaring their victory. While our remaining troops were forced to flee from Bashkiria, we will return and all traitors of revolution will pay for their mistakes."
bkn.14.a: "They can be happy, but not for too long."

bkn.15.t: "The Battle Lost!"
bkn.15.d: "Unfortunately, the Ufa 'defenders' managed to hold the city and wait for reinforcements from Moscow. After several weeks of siege, their morale was strong. Due to our strategical mistakes, they managed to spread propaganda that we want to completely destroy the city with air bombings and artillery, turning the citizens against us. While Qyzyl Machet remains our stronghold, it is unknown for how much longer can we hold it."
bkn.15.a: "Long live Soviet Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.16.t: "Crackdown on Nationalists"
bkn.16.d: "Due to our preparedness to a bloody siege of Ufa, the local Soviets have managed to hold the city. While nationalists still hold control of Mrakovo, they are almost certainly doomed."

bkn.17.t: "Ties With [RVA.GetName]"
bkn.17.d: "While we are ready to fight for our independence, no doubt our main enemies are in [RUS.Capital.GetName], while those who oppose them are our friends. The government of General [RVA.GetLeader] in [RVA.Capital.GetName] is not the best choice, their troops bordering vital city of Sterlitamak, can really help us.\n\n[ROOT.GetName] suggests that we send a delegation to [RVA.GetNameDef] and try to sign a cooperation agreement with them for the sake of acquiring our ancestral lands, but in return we will have to offer them something. One way or another, while the civil war is raging in the rest of Russia, we will be able to get our lands and prepare an army"
bkn.17.a: "Send a delegation to [RVA.Capital.GetName]"
bkn.17.b: "It's a waste of time!"

bkn.18.t: "Delegation From Bashkirs"
bkn.18.d: "Today, a delegation from the Bashkir national government was sent to our general Staff - in fact, separatist, but in need of our help to capture Sterlitamak and Ufa. In return, the Bashkirs promised to recognize the legitimacy of our government.\n\nAlthough a number of high-ranking generals and officials intend to reject this audacious proposal, while the Bashkirs do not fully obey us, some more progressive commanders recognize that collaborating with the Bashkir forces in an offensive operation against Sterlitamak, followed by the temporary transfer of certain territories to their use, could secure one of our fronts and allow us to focus on crossing the Volga and seizing its right bank."
bkn.18.a: "Reject these miserable terms!"
bkn.18.b: "March on Sterlitamak and give it to Bashkirs after capturing."

bkn.19.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees"
bkn.19.d: "Fortunately, the general [RVA.GetLeader]'s administration has acceded to our proposal, and a cooperative agreement has been concluded between us. In the not-too-distant future, our forces will be prepared to launch a joint offensive against Sterlitamak, with the aim of liberating it from the duplicitous Soviet regime."
bkn.19.a: "If successful, Sterlitamak will be in our possession."

bkn.20.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused"
bkn.20.d: "Alas or alack, the administration of General [RVA.GetLeader] has declined our proposal. Consequently, Sterlitamak remains in the possession of the renegade Manatov for the time being. Nonetheless, our leadership maintains confidence that this state of affairs will not persist, and this incident serves as yet another indication of our divergence from the path of unity with any Russia."
bkn.20.a: "Bashkurdistan shall be free!"

bkn.21.t: "Bashkir Forces Are Gearing Up"
bkn.21.d: "The Bashkir nationalists have established a stronghold on the eastern bank of the Belaya River and are poised to launch an assault on a major regional centre, Sterlitamak. It is evident that if they succeed in taking control of Sterlitamak, they will continue their advance, with Belebey being the next target.\n\nThe fall of these two urban centres will lead to a consolidation of Bashkir nationalist forces on the outskirts of Ufa, which is currently under our control. The local administration in the city is currently under the control of a workers' and peasants' council, but their resources are insufficient to repel an attack.\n\nWe are faced with a difficult choice: either to send additional troops to protect Sterlitamak and risk losing them without repelling the Bashkir attack, or to focus on strengthening our position in Ufa and risk leaving Sterlitamak vulnerable to the rebels. This latter option would at least weaken the Bashkirs somewhat and bolster our allies in Ufa, but it would also leave Sterlitamak undefended against the traitorous Kornilovites."
bkn.21.a: "Try to defend Sterlitamak"
bkn.21.b: "Give up Sterlitamak and defend Ufa!"

bkn.22.t: "Liberation of Sterlitamak and Belebey"
bkn.22.d: "In a decisive move the Härbi Shurahy orchestrates a triumphant liberation campaign. Focused on reclaiming territories, the Bashkir forces, led by General Ğalimyän Tağan himself, employ strategic brilliance to swiftly advance, gaining control over strategic points and rallying local support. As news of the victories spreads, the momentum of the Bashkir autonomy movement gains strength, setting the stage for the most serious battle - battle for Ufa. However, this struggle was not without its own setbacks, as the Bolshevik forces retaliated, albeit unable to halt our advance, they nevertheless managed to inflict damage on our ranks."
bkn.22.a: "Another victory for the just cause!"

#negotiations
bkn.23.t: "The Disagreements Within Irek"
bkn.23.d: "In Ufa, which is under Russian occupation, the socialist government operates as a one-party Soviet led by the Irek National Party. The elected chairman of the Ufa Soviet, Shärif Manatov, is a prominent figure among the Bashkirs, having recently returned from exile in the French Commune. His background suggests that he primarily advocates for the interests of Bashkirs. Initially aligned with the Mensheviks-Internationalists, Manatov has since both joined the Bolsheviks and adopted moderate and nationalistic positions. Despite being a newcomer to our ranks and viewed by many as a traitor by representatives of the Härbi Shurahy, there is confidence that he can be swayed if concessions are offered. This could allow us to take control of Ufa without conflict and repel Russian red imperialism.\n\nOn the contrary, the opposition to Manatov remains strong not only within our government but also within the Irek. Manatov does not lead the party but is merely its representative. The leadership of the party, a left-radical Haris Yomağolov holds a negative view of Manatov, alleging that he harbors nationalist tendencies. However, they were compelled to appoint him as the head of the council due to his expertise and popularity both within Bashkurdistan and beyond its borders.\n\nIt is possible to exploit the internal divisions within the Bashkir socialists and exert pressure on Manatov to seek our support, which could potentially lead to a schism within the party. Alternatively, we could offer Manatov the chance to openly align with us in exchange for concessions, thereby depriving the Russophile faction of popular backing."
bkn.23.a: "Weaken the Irek from within." #-> Irek splits/Coup in Ufa/Manatov's Leadership
bkn.23.b: "Offer concessions to Manatov for his loyalty." #-> Terms of Manatov

bkn.24.t: "The Split Among The Ufa Soviet"
bkn.24.d: "In the midst of the preparations for the Ufa battle, we received intelligence from a staunch Bolshevik and a member of the Ufa Soviet, Shahit Hozaybirzin, regarding a potential betrayal. It appears that Shärif Manatov, the current chairman of the Soviet, who was elected by a majority as an experienced revolutionary hailing from the French Commune, is in fact a nationalist and secessionist, fostering a schism within the Soviet and accusing the radical left-wing of a propensity towards terror and oppression against the Bashkirs.\n\nHozaybirzin maintains that the current composition of the Ufa Soviet is incapable of functioning effectively, and it is imperative that a new Soviet government be promptly established in Ufa under the guidance of a committed Bolshevik administration. In his opinion, Manatov should be ousted and apprehended, and his release should not be permitted under any circumstances.\n\nWe must engage in this contest: on the one hand, Manatov might be the sole individual capable of unifying Bashkiria, and it may be worthwhile to grant him the means to unite the nationalist factions under his leadership. Conversely, a more steadfast and resolute leader would undoubtedly be capable of eradicating separatist sentiments in Bashkiria."
bkn.24.a: "Do not interfere." #-> Irek Splits
bkn.24.b: "Support Hozaybirzin's coup." #-> Coup in Ufa
bkn.24.c: "Arrest Hozaybirzin instead." #-> Irek Won't Join BKN

bkn.25.t: "The Coup in Ufa"
bkn.25.d: "The government of Manatov has been ousted in Ufa. The opposition to his rule was led by Bolshevik leader Shahit Hozaybirzin and the local Red Guards. It is clear that this audacious incident was orchestrated by [RUS.Capital.GetName] and its agents.\n\nIf we had hoped for a weakening of socialist positions in Ufa under the leadership of Hozaybirzin, it is not the case. On the contrary, Hozaybirzin does not enjoy the same level of popular support as Manatov, whom he has arrested. Perhaps we can take advantage of this by promising the Bashkir people of Ufa that we will release Manatov once we have taken control of the city."
bkn.25.a: "Publicly condemn Manatov's arrest and demand his release."
bkn.25.b: "Condem the coup, yet refrain from making grandiose declarations."

bkn.26.t: "Manatov's Stature"
bkn.26.d: "Our attempts to undermine Irek and the Ufa Council proved unsuccessful, instead leading to a series of events that paradoxically strengthened Manatov’s position. Suspecting that Manatov’s opposition might disrupt the coordinated efforts of the Ufa Council, the Russian government decided to apprehend some left-wing radicals in Ufa, including Shahit Hozaybirzin, the head of local Bolsheviks. Now, Manatov holds almost complete control over Ufa’s power, and it is clear that he intends to utilize this authority to consolidate Bashkiria under his authority."
bkn.26.a: "That's unexpected."

bkn.27.t: "The Split Among The Ufa Soviet"
bkn.27.d: "The events that unfolded were largely in line with our expectations. The left-wing radicals in the Ufa council have attempted to oust Manatov from his position, presenting us with a golden opportunity to capitalize on the situation.\n\nAs anticipated, Manatov has secretly appealed to our government for assistance in his struggle against Russians and left-leaning radicals. In exchange, he pledges to recognize the authority of our government over the territories currently under our control, while maintaining his leadership role in Ufa.\n\nThe ultimate power structure across Bashkurdistan shall be determined through a nationwide election to be conducted post-liberation, with Ğalimyän Tağan obliged to relinquish his power immediately, ceding control to a civilian administration."
bkn.27.a: "Accept his offer."
bkn.27.b: "Divide and conquer - we will not help him."

bkn.28.t: "Manatov's Terms"
bkn.28.d: "It is possible that contacting Manatov was not the wisest course of action. Despite the presence of significant opposition to him within the Ufa Soviet, he thus far has no reason to assume that he requires our assistance. Nonetheless, Manatov has outlined the conditions under which the conflict would conclude and Bashkurdistan would achieve unity.\n\nThe first condition is the resignation of Ğalimyän Tağan as leader of the Härbi Shurahy. In exchange, Manatov proposes the candidacy of Musa Mortazin, a protégé of his own. Under his leadership, our forces will enter Ufa and arrest the opposition members of the Ufa council. Following this, the unity of Bashkurdistan will be proclaimed and a unified interim government established."
#TODO: Manatov's path
#bkn.28.a: "The unity of Bashkurdistan is worth it!"
bkn.28.b: "Wretch, we shall lay waste to him!"

bkn.29.t: "Fall of Ufa!"
bkn.29.d: "Having acceded to Manatov's terms, the plan commenced its execution. Tağan relinquished his position, and under Mortazin's leadership, the troops marched into Ufa without resistance. Minor skirmishes occurred within the city, primarily involving adherents of Khudaibergen, but they were swiftly quelled. Capitalizing on this opportunity, Manatov proclaimed the establishment of a provisional all-Bashkir administration presided over by Mortazin, with plans to convene the Qoroltay shortly thereafter."
bkn.29.a: "Long live free Bashkurdistan!"

bkn.30.t: "Fall of Ufa!"
bkn.30.d: "In Ufa, a treacherous pact was forged between the Soviet leader, Manatov, and nationalist elements. Having premeditated their actions, they resolved to unite against the local proponents of our government. In the ensuing urban skirmishes, our supporters were either vanquished or compelled to capitulate, while the remnants of our forces were forced to retreat beyond the borders of Bashkiria. We will return and all traitors of revolution will pay for their mistakes."
bkn.30.a: "They can be happy, but not for too long."

bkn.31.t: "The Bashobkom"
bkn.31.d: "Following the defeat of the counterrevolutionary forces, all authority in Bashkiria now rests with our workers' and peasant council. In place of the Irek National Party, closely associated with Manatov despite the increasing influence of the left-leaning radical leader Yumagusov, the power in our Soviet republic is to be transferred under the supervision of the Bashkir Regional Committee of the [RUS.GetRulingParty]. Alongside the establishment of this committee, it is intended to declare the Bashkir Soviet Republic in its entirety and form a government under its responsibility."
bkn.31.a: "Great!"

bkn.32.t: "Välidi Rallies Loyalists"
bkn.32.d: "Despite the fact that Ähmätzäki Välidi found himself in exile in Turkestan, his memory as a patriot and a citizen remains vivid in the hearts of many in his native Bashkurdistan. With his return, political activism in the country has been revived, and Välidi, who addresses rallies and publishes extensively in newspapers, has garnered a significant following in support of a united socialist Turkestan.\n\nFrom the podium, Välidi espouses the support of the government and the general staff, for he believes they will guide Bashkurdistan towards the attainment of independence and democracy."
bkn.32.a: "We appreciate his help."

bkn.33.t: "The Lame Išan"
bkn.33.d: "Mohammat-Ğabdulhay Qorbanğaliyev, a prominent figure in the spiritual sphere among Muslims in Bashkurdistan, known under the pseudonym \"Lame Ishan\", is a person of considerable significance, albeit one who is viewed with hostility by many adherents of Jadidism, democracy, and socialism. During the time when Kolchak dismantled and prohibited national autonomies, Mohammat-Ğabdulhay aligned himself with Kolchak and continued to engage in combat on the White side. Ğalimyän Tağan followed suit, and as a result, within the ranks of the Härbi Shurahy leadership, Qorbanğaliyev is regarded not only as a popular figure among the masses but also as a fellow-minded individual.\n\nQorbanğaliyev advocates for the spiritual autonomy of Muslims from Tatar intellectuals, whom he accused of spreading socialist ideas that corrupt the masses. He called for the implementation of Sharia law in our state as well.\n\nIn recent years, Mohammat-Ğabdulhay has become disenchanted with the policies of the Russian government and has been residing in Japan for several years. It is reported that he has sought the support of the Japanese government. Despite his peculiar support for the \"White Forces\", which oppose the evils of socialism, Qorbanğaliyev also encourages Muslims to unite."
bkn.33.a: "The muslims are on our side."

bkn.34.t: "The Tatar Merchant Lobby"
bkn.34.d: "The conquest of Ufa has brought a new challenge to the attention of our government — the ascendancy of Tatar merchants, who have been amassing wealth in these lands for decades. Despite the fact that Bashkirs predominate in the population of the Ufa Gubernia, the majority of Tatar presence remains concentrated in urban areas, where they also promote the idea of Muslim unity.\n\nThese merchants not only exercise their influence through their financial power, but also through the active propagation of their beliefs through Jadidist religious schools. Moreover, they now have clear connections with the newly established Tatar government of [TTR.GetLeader] in Kazan, further solidifying their position.\n\nIt is imperative that we address the issue of these merchants, scholars, and \"murzas\", who continue to exert their influence on the minds of our citizens, not only in Ufa but throughout the entire country."
bkn.34.a: "As long as their taxes go to our treasury."
bkn.34.b: "Undoubtedly their hegemony must end."

bkn.35.t: "The Remnants of the Red Guards"
bkn.35.d: "Ufa has fallen, yet the poison of socialist ideas continues to infect the minds of Bashkir citizens. The dissolution of the Red Guards left many of their members in detention, while ordinary soldiers were granted amnesty despite their voluntary enlistment in this socialist militia.\n\nThe influence of pro-Russian ideas propagated by the Irek Party remains potent, and it is imperative that we confront the remnants of the Red Guard with vigor. While the battle for Ufa may be considered won, the war itself is far from over."
bkn.35.a: "We must ensure Bolshevism won't spread."
bkn.35.b: "Show them the right path."

bkn.36.t: "The IV All-Bashkir Qoroltay"
bkn.36.d: "Today, the Fourth All-Bashkir Qoroltay commences its operation in Ufa, with the objective of adopting several critical resolutions on pressing matters. Furthermore, the assembly is expected to elect the composition of the government, and it is anticipated that general elections will be announced shortly thereafter.\n\nAmong the key topics on the agenda, there is, of course, the question of Bashkurdistan's independence, the issue of canton governance, land, culture, education, and science. The vast majority of participants are Bashkirs, although Tatars and Russians also contribute to the proceedings of the Qoroltay."
bkn.36.a: "Great!"

bkn.37.t: "Declaration of Independence"
bkn.37.d: "As two decades ago, so now, the question of the sovereignty and independence of the future republic remains a matter of paramount importance at the Qoroltay. While it may seem that circumstances leave little room for choice, with Bashkurdistan seemingly destined to become an independent state, this position is firmly upheld by both the military elite of Härbi Shurahy and pan-Turkists, led by the prominent figure Välidi. However, there is significant opposition from both Russian representatives and advocates of national and cultural autonomy. Among these opponents are those who support the so-called \"white\" Russia, as well as those who remain loyal to the Soviet cause.\n\nNonetheless, the majority of delegates have expressed their support..."
bkn.37.a: "...for autonomy of Bashkurdistan." #-> bkn.43
bkn.37.b: "...for independence!"

bkn.38.t: "The Cantonal Governance"
bkn.38.d: "One of the pressing issues on the contemporary political agenda is the question of territorial administration at the level of cantons. The cantonal system, introduced by the Tsarist regime, contributed to the process of colonization of our country and the dismantlement of the traditional system of self-government known as yiyins. Among the adverse consequences of the implementation of cantonal administration, it is noteworthy to mention the deterioration in the financial position of ordinary citizens, who came under the complete control of tribal leaders and the Russian authorities. Nonetheless, this system also had positive aspects. It contributed to the transition of nomadic populations into settled agricultural communities, albeit through coercive means, which resulted in an improvement in the economic and cultural standing of these villages. In Bashkir settlements, for instance, winter wheat cultivation began to flourish, and the introduction of potatoes and other crops became widespread. Educational opportunities also expanded.\n\nAt the Third All-Bashkir Qoroltay, a comprehensive \"Regulation on Cantonal Government\" was adopted. This document vested the cantonal authorities with the responsibility of managing administrative and economic affairs. The cantonal structures were comprised of two key components: cantonal dumas (Divans), and cantonal administrations (Bashkarmas). In terms of governance, the cantons of Bashkir autonomy were subject to regulations similar to those applied to county zemstvos. The institutions of justices of the peace, judicial procedures, and the taxation system remained in place.\n\nThe Congress proposes to uphold the resolution of the previous Qoroltay, but there is a faction of dissenters, predominantly comprised of more conservative delegates. They advocate for unity and oppose maintaining the cantonal system, seeking instead to centralize power."
bkn.38.a: "The decision of the III Qoroltay remains in force."
bkn.38.b: "End to the cantons!"
bkn.38.c: "The issue of cantons is totally up to Härbi Shurahy!"

bkn.39.t: "The Land Issue"
bkn.39.d: "The issue of land occupied a central position at the previous Bashkir Qoroltay. In addressing this matter, the delegates to the congress approached it as one of the most significant issues in the history of the Bashkir people, which continues to be so during the process of building national statehood.\n\nThe decision of the Third Qoroltay on the issue of land was based on three principles: lands, forests, and mineral resources belong to the Bashkir nation; lands unfairly taken from Bashkir territories during the era of \"Bashkir land plundering\" must be returned to their rightful owners; and lands should be allocated to Bashkir peasants regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, or religious affiliation.\n\nAt the current congress, several delegates announced that due to political developments both in Bashkurdistan and in Russia as a whole, the previous law was effectively repealed and never implemented. A separate group of participants advocated the restoration of ancestral lands, thereby reviving the class of Bashkir landlords.\n\nIn contrast, the left-leaning delegates opposed this proposal, arguing for the immediate socialization of land. To achieve this goal, they proposed amending the resolution on land, forests, and subsoil adopted at the previous Qoroltay with minor modifications."
bkn.39.a: "Adopt a resolution on the socialization of land with minor amendments."
bkn.39.b: "Draft a new land legislation based on the recommendations of religious authorities." #-> bkn.43

bkn.40.t: "The Religious Matters"
bkn.40.d: "The Third Qoroltay advocated two key initiatives on religious matters. Firstly, they called for the establishment of an independent Bashkir Spiritual Administration separate from the Orenburg Muftiyate, which they believed was dominated by Tatar mullahs. This aspiration was first articulated at the First All-Bashkir Qoroltay. Secondly, the resolution \"On Spiritual Governance\" sought to streamline the management of religious affairs among Bashkir Muslims. The decree explicitly outlined the roles and responsibilities of the mufti, other religious officials, and various spiritual institutions, ranging from the Supreme Spiritual Council to the Main Spiritual Administration down to parish-level spiritual administrations.\n\nThe conservatives, represented by the Qadimists and Išаn Qorbanğaliyev, have been gaining ground and criticizing the resolution of the Third Bashkir Qoroltay. This resolution, in their view, approached religious matters too democratically and was in line with the demands of the Jadidist movement.\n\nThe opening paragraph of the \"On Spiritual Governance\" resolution stated, \"Religion is separate from the state, and the state does not appoint or provide clergy.\" However, according to this same resolution, the Bashkir government is obligated to issue certificates for clerics who have been elected as members of the Main Spiritual Directorate. For instance, cases of appealing election results for Shaikhulislam, or mufti, are subject to review by the plenum of the Bashkurdistan government.\n\nAnother significant point on the agenda concerned school education, which still lacked a clear distinction between secular and religious schools. The conservatives supported this status quo, while the progressives advocated for necessary reforms."
bkn.40.a: "In formulating the stance, one should adhere to the perspective of Qorbanğaliyev."
bkn.40.b: "Adopt an even more democratic resolution regarding religious affairs." #-> bkn.41

bkn.41.t: "Independent Spiritual Administration"
bkn.41.d: "Nonetheless, the Qadimists insisted that the congress issue a definitive resolution, in a separate motion, regarding the establishment of an independent Bashkir Spiritual Administration separate from the Orenburg Muftiyate. Failing to do so, Qorbanğaliyev threatened to protest and withdraw Muslim delegates from the Qoroltay, and to refuse to recognize its resolutions.\n\nSuch perfidious insolence cannot go unavenged. Certainly, the congress may acquiesce to Qorbanğaliyev’s demands, yet Välidi chose not to follow in the footsteps of the clergy, stating that a decision on the matter would be reached in conjunction with the rest of the resolution. Consequently, the ambitions of the clerics will be virtually disregarded, albeit it is evident that an autonomous Bashkir Spiritual Administration will eventually be established. Qorbanğaliyev’s intention was to defer the adoption of resolutions regarding the interplay between secular and religious authorities, which resolution was intended to impact, and, from the perspective of the Qadimists, to render them contingent upon the Jadidsts."
bkn.41.a: "Alright, be decieved by their ploy."
bkn.41.b: "No concessions to these Muslim Black-Hundredists!" #-> bkn.42

bkn.42.t: "Qadimists Abandon the Qoroltay"
bkn.42.d: "Certainly, this state of affairs was not to Qorbanğaliyev's liking, and the delegates from the Muslim bloc left the congress en masse, effectively leaving it in the hands of the Socialists and Pan-Turkists. There was, in fact, a quorum present, and the resolutions would remain valid in one way or another; however, such a scandalous event could not go unnoticed by Tağan. Moreover, it served as a catalyst for his ambitions.\n\nDespite being one of Välidi's staunchest supporters and allies, Tağan was dissatisfied with the idea of leaving the republic entirely in the hands of radicals. The Muslim bloc had been instrumental in balancing the Qoroltay, preventing it from adopting overly radical measures.\n\nThus, Tağan, along with the bloc of non-partisan and military elites he leads, could exploit the situation to prematurely dissolve the Qoroltay and now express no confidence in such constituent assembly, which is lacking a significant Muslim delegation. In doing so, he would undoubtedly be openly defying Välidi and his allies, but it would provide him with the moral justification to maintain his position of power."
bkn.42.a: "Tağan ought to embark on such an escapade."
bkn.42.b: "It's better not to antagonize the majority of the Qoroltay."

bkn.43.t: "ERK's Threats"
bkn.43.d: "The current state of affairs was not at all satisfactory for Välidi and his faction. The struggle for the liberation of Bashkurdistan and Turkestan must not be halted due to the minor majority of \"Muslim Black Hundred\" sympathizers and other autonomy advocates who are opposed to the freedom and well-being of our people. Välidi delivered a scathing critique of the anti-secessionists.\n\nTağan, who has long been a staunch supporter of Välidi's, also plays a role in this critical situation, albeit with some disagreements. His role is to dissolve the unlawful Qoroltay in concert with Välidi; if the ERK withdraws from the congress, it will leave the Qoroltay with an insufficient number of participants, rendering its decisions invalid. Nevertheless, Tağan will continue to serve as head of the republic and offer to lead the government under Välidi, thereby potentially counterbalancing its decisions."
bkn.43.a: "Tağan ought to embark on such an escapade."
bkn.43.b: "It's better to avoid resorting to undemocratic measures."

bkn.44.t: "ERK Leaves the Qoroltay"
bkn.44.d: "The threats posed by Välidi are grave — today, the entire delegation backing him withdrew from the congress, leaving him without the necessary quorum to take decisions. Moreover, Välidi has engaged in open confrontation, calling for rallies and strikes against the unlawful Qoroltay. Should we fail to rescind the decision on autonomy and the Qoroltay refuse to accept the terms of Bashkiria's full independence, we are at risk of facing significant challenges."
bkn.44.a: "Declare independence forthwith!"
bkn.44.b: "Do not yield to provocation!"

bkn.45.t: "The Outcome of the Confrontation"
bkn.45.d: "Ähmätzäki Välidi has openly declared war — not only has he denounced our leader, Ğalimyän Tağan, as a traitor to the people's interests, recalling his association with Kolchak, but also asserted that the Qadimist clergy seeks to return the Bashkirs to the dark ages. This is an act beyond the pale, and in response to Välidi's call, people have already started erecting barricades in Sterlitamak and Ufa. It is imperative that we provide a decisive rebuff to this faction of socialists, regardless of how much they may malign the government in Petrograd or resign in defeat."
bkn.45.a: "Long live independent Bashkurdistan!"
bkn.45.b: "The rebellion has been suppressed, long live the General!"

bkn.46.t: "ERK Leaves the Qoroltay"
bkn.46.d: "The threats posed by Välidi are grave — today, the entire delegation backing him withdrew from the congress, leaving him without the necessary quorum to take decisions. Moreover, Välidi has engaged in open confrontation, calling for rallies and strikes against the unlawful Qoroltay. Should we fail to rescind the decision on land socialization and the Qoroltay refuse to accept it, we are at risk of facing significant challenges."
bkn.46.a: "Reject conservatives' land policy."
bkn.46.b: "Do not yield to provocation!"

bkn.47.t: "The Outcome of the Confrontation"
bkn.47.d: "Ähmätzäki Välidi has openly declared war — not only has he denounced our leader, Ğalimyän Tağan, as a traitor to the people's interests, recalling his association with Kolchak, but also asserted that the Qadimist clergy seeks to return the Bashkirs to the dark ages. This is an act beyond the pale, and in response to Välidi's call, people have already started erecting barricades in Sterlitamak and Ufa. It is imperative that we provide a decisive rebuff to this faction of socialists, regardless of how much they may malign the government in Petrograd or resign in defeat."
bkn.47.a: "Irek joins the strike and Tağan is overthrown."
bkn.47.b: "Irek remains neutral and the rebellion has been suppressed."

bkn.48.t: "Qadimists Abandon the Qoroltay"
bkn.48.d: "Certainly, this state of affairs was not to Qorbanğaliyev's liking, and the delegates from the Muslim bloc left the congress en masse, effectively leading to the dissolution of the Qoroltay. This catastrophic state of affairs can only mean that Tağan, along with the bloc of non-partisan and military elites he leads, should take power in his own hands once again."
bkn.48.a: "Is this the end of the Bashkir democracy?"

bkn.49.t: "General Tağan Assumes Power"
bkn.49.d: "The attempt to democratically resolve the issue of power was doomed to failure, for it is not truth that is born in disputes, but only doubt that multiplies.\n\nTo openly oppose the Military Council, which had brought independence and liberation to Ufa, was a step the general and his associates could not forgive. With a heavy heart but a firm hand, Ğalimyän Tağan announced today the disruption of elections to the National Qoroltay, the banning of freedom of assembly, and the imposition of martial law in Bashkurdistan. He declared that Bashkiria was surrounded by enemies and Russia was dying in the bloodshed of civil war. He vowed to hold the position of president until peace reigned."
bkn.49.a: "Glory to the general!"

bkn.50.t: "Tağan and Välidi Assume Power"
bkn.50.d: "Today, General Tağan and Välidi, leader of the ERK party, issued a joint declaration stating that due to the clergy's attempts to undermine the elections to the Qoroltay, it has been decided to form a unified government with the participation of the People's Front and the ERK Party, excluding the Qorbanğaliyev faction.
General Tagan has been designated as the President of the Republic, and Ähmätzäki Välidi will assume the position of Prime Minister. It is anticipated that a People's Qoroltay will be convened in the near future."
bkn.50.a: "Glory to our patriots!"

bkn.51.t: "Tulqyn And the Qoroltay Elections"
bkn.51.d: "The third All-Bashkir Qoroltay not only marked the independence of Bashkurdistan, but also gave birth to a progressive youth movement. At this time, Shäyyehzada Babich, a 22-year-old poet of Tatar-Bashkir origin, and his colleagues founded the All-Bashkir Youth Union Tulqyn. Members of the union regularly organized cultural events, such as literary evenings, concerts and performances. For instance, they held a large concert in Orenburg at the cinema \"Lux\", titled \"Evenings of Bashkurdistan\". This concert was attended by delegates from the III All-Bashkir Qoroltay. Babich himself recited excerpts from his poem \"Gazazil\", while a string orchestra, kuraist ensemble, and amateur performers presented Bashkir, Mishar, and Teptyar songs and dances.\n\nHowever, the most significant aspect is that the Tulqyn organization conducted extensive propaganda efforts among the population, encouraging them to participate in the construction of the national autonomy of Bashkurdistan in a more significant manner. Subsequently, publishing and musical and dramatic divisions were established under the union, which, during the conditions of the civil war, hosted cultural events for the soldiers of the Bashkir army as well as in the villages and districts of the Bashkir republic.\n\nFollowing the arrest of the Bashkir government in February 1918, a portion of the members of the Tulqyn, led by A. Davletshin, became the initiators of the Provisional Revolutionary Council of Bashkurdistan (VRSB), advocating for the creation of Soviet autonomy for the Bashkirs. Nonetheless, the majority of the members of the youth organization continued to support the Bashkir government and the national-territorial autonomy endorsed at the III Qoroltay.\n\nA similar ideological divide is now apparent. While the majority of Tulqyn support the independence of Bashkurdistan, there is currently no trace of previous unity, as various leaders with differing platforms vie for leading positions. Tulqyn may support a particular candidate or remain neutral, yet it is possible that the outcome of the election could hinge on this difficult choice."
bkn.51.a: "Tulqyn supports Ähmätzäki Välidi!"
bkn.51.b: "Tulqyn will not support anyone"
bkn.51.c: "Unexpectedly, Irek received the support of the Tulqyn's left-wing."

bkn.52.t: "Babich Resigns From Tulqyn"
bkn.52.d: "The fact that Tulqyn, despite this, supported Irek with a majority, did not go unnoticed by the esteemed founder of the organization, Shäyyehzada Babich. Although he had resigned from his position as chairman of the organization at least since September 1918, he continued to be a prominent figure in the media and his wise counsel was sought after. In addition, he remained a member of Tulqyn's executive committee.\n\nDue to Babich's declaration of \"Bolshevization of Tulqyn\", he openly announced his departure and called on young Bashkir voters not to fall for the provocations of socialists infiltrating Tulqyn's ranks. The question of whether or not a new, democratic youth organization is necessary, has yet to be answered, but it is possible that the Bashkir youth movement may no longer be as unified in response to Tulqyn's actions."
bkn.52.a: "The division within Bashkir society has also affected the younger generation."

bkn.53.t: "The Tatars Faced With a Choice"
bkn.53.d: "The Tatar people, who are related to the Bashkir people, have been considered friendly and brotherly for a long time. However, the revolution and civil war brought about a change in this perception. The fact that the Turkic project offered by the Tatars was not satisfactory for the majority of the Turkic population in Russia led to the active development of national movements. This, in turn, increased nationalism among Turks and led to fears about Tatars, who, similar to Kazakhs in Central Asia, were associated with the Socialist and Bolshevik accomplices.\n\nBashkir nationalism is strong and opposes not only Russians but also Tatars. Various manifestations of this include, for example, the Kadimists of Qorbanğaliyev, who openly call for overthrowing the power of \"Tatar mullahs\". Others advocate for separation from Tatars and even purification of Bashkiria of Tatars.\n\nRegardless of how ambitious these aspirations may be, in one way or another, a significant portion of the population in numerous villages, towns, and the western region of the country, including our largest city of Ufa, consists of Tatars. In many respects, the outcome of parliamentary elections hinges on their support. It is unlikely that they would support those who openly promote Bashkir nationalism."
bkn.53.a: "ERK mobilizes Tatar voters by advocating the unity of Turkic peoples."
bkn.53.b: "Irek underscores the internationalist character of the movement."
bkn.53.c: "Tağan is the sole advocate for the unity of all people in the republic."

bkn.54.t: "The Issue of Executive Authority"
bkn.54.d: "During the III Qoroltay, the issue of executive leadership was resolved in the following manner: a pre-legislative body was elected, which constituted the Bashkir government. Yunis Bikbov was appointed as the chairperson of the government, effectively serving as the Prime Minister of Bashkurdistan, until the termination of the government during the outcome of the civil war. Additionally, in conjunction with the government, the Bashkir Central Shuro (council) was established during the I Qoroltay. This body promoted the activities of the Bashkir administration, engaged in anti-Bolshevik agitation, raised funds for the requirements of the Bashkir national movement, and fostered relations with other ethnic movements. In essence, its operations were not strictly defined.\n\nIn this regard, the current Qoroltay should develop a comprehensive constitution for Bashkurdistan, which will be the main document to resolve all the contradictions in the country's political structure. The adoption of the constitution is planned after the elections, during discussions in the elected state parliament, but it is now possible to outline the key principles.\n\nA number of delegates, mainly Tağan's supporters have proposed a more extensive and autonomous role for the prime minister of the government, akin to that of a minister-president who would be elected by parliamentary majority and form his own cabinet. However, opponents of this proposal criticize it for its authoritarian nature and propose a more collegial approach: the formation of a cabinet led by the chairperson, who will be appointed by parliament and be accountable to it."
bkn.54.a: "Tağan's amendment is coming through!"
bkn.54.b: "The Qoroltay rejects the amendment."

bkn.55.t: "Controversy Surrounding the Russian-Bashkir Agreement"
bkn.55.d: "One of the issues that arose at the Qoroltay was the issue of confidence in applicants for positions in the All-Russian government, given the circumstances, etc. Closely linked to the issue of Bashkurdistan's autonomy, several delegates raised questions about confidence in Tağan and Härbi Shurahy, who had signed an agreement with the Russian Volunteer Army several months ago. The delegates strongly criticized this agreement, despite the military's attempts to dismiss it as a provocation and argue that the terms would not be fully implemented.\n\nIn any case, Tağan was asked directly what the actions of the Bashkir Host should be if, under the terms of the agreement between Bashkurdistan and [RVA.GetNameDef], the latter should require mobilization and declaration of war on the [RUS.Capital.GetName] Soviet government. Tağan avoided answering the question, stating that it would be a decision for the elected government.\n\nSuch a response, of course, was not satisfactory to the opponents, who therefore demanded that the Qoroltay pass a resolution on their attitude towards the civil war in Russia. They also requested that the assembly officially declare independence and neutrality and notify the signatories to the agreement on behalf of [RVA.GetNameDef].\n\nTağan argued that such a resolution could lead to war with Russia and encouraged delegates not to yield to provocation and to reject the resolution."
bkn.55.a: "Kurultai did not respond to provocation."
bkn.55.b: "Kurultai insisted on breaking the agreement with [217.Capital.GetName]"

bkn.56.t: "Demarche of the Bashkirs"
bkn.56.d: "A few days ago, during the so-called Bashkir Qoroltay, there was a discussion regarding the agreement that had been previously signed with representatives of the Bashkir people and their armed forces. Together, a joint operation was carried out to liberate Sterlitamak and Belebey from Soviet control and transfer these territories to the Bashkir Military Council. However, the Qoroltay, under the influence of its own power, accused General Tagan of violating national interests and demanded an immediate withdrawal from the agreement. Regrettably, the misled Bashkirs agreed with the demands of jihadist elements and decided to terminate the agreement."
bkn.56.a: "This should not be left unanswered."

bkn.57.t: "Tağan Leads the People's Front"
bkn.57.d: "At the dawn of Bashkir statehood, Tağan, a prominent figure, joined the fray for the right to shape the government, surrounded by supporters from the military council. While professing his non-affiliation with any party, Tağan is forging a broad coalition — the People's Front — to participate in elections, advocating in defense of Bashkir interests.\n\nVeteran organizations of various Bashkir groups are rallying around this new actor on the political stage, representing a segment of the middle class unwilling to support the left-leaning parties. Tağan presents his platform as civic, advocating for unity among all citizens of the republic regardless of their background, and for a moderate approach primarily focused on the well-being of the populace.\n\nThis flexible approach is likely to carve out a niche for itself, attracting the votes of moderates from the Democratic camp who have been marginalized."
bkn.57.a: "That's unexpected!"

bkn.60.t: "Elections to the Kese Qoroltay"
bkn.60.d: "Finally, the election campaign, perhaps the most intense in the history of the Bashkir people and, in fact, the first real electoral process, has concluded. A number of different parties and movements competed for majority representation in the Bashkurdistan Parliament, the Small Qoroltay (Kese Qoroltay), which will serve for the next three years. The winners of this contest are..."
bkn.60.a: "Tağan and his People's Front declares their victory."
bkn.60.b: "Qadimist delegated received the majority"
bkn.60.c: "National Party Irek managed to win."
bkn.60.e: "ERK received the mandate of the people."
bkn.60.f: "Tağan allied with Qadimists secured the majority."
bkn.60.g: "Välidi and Tağan form a coalition bloc."
bkn.60.h: "ERK wins, forming a coalition with Irek moderates."


bkn.100.t: "[FROM.GetName] Wishes to Join Us"
bkn.100.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government, recognizing its future lies only as a part of Russia, has recognized us a legitimate government of all of Russia and offered their help in our struggle against unlawful [219.Owner.GetName] in [219.Owner.Capital.GetName]."

## Military Events ##
bkn_mil.1.t: "The Nation of Warriors"
bkn_mil.1.d: "The Bashkirs have a long history as a nation renowned for their martial prowess, their military skills having been forged through centuries of conflict on the vast Eurasian Steppe. From the days of the Golden Horde, when we served in the armies of the Russian Empire, the Bashkirs nurtured a proud tradition of military excellence, excelling in horseback combat, reconnaissance, and guerrilla tactics.\n\nIn the Napoleonic era, Bashkir cavalrymen fought across Europe, earning a fearsome reputation for their swiftness and endurance. A century later, during the Russian Civil War, the Bashkir fighters once again demonstrated their worth, forming the only combat-capable army with insignia and competent officers among the people of inner Russia and Siberia. No matter the political landscape, the steadfastness of our soldiers in defending their homeland's independence and their battle-honed skills remained unwavering.\n\nThe survival in the steppe has always demanded fortitude, resilience, and rigor. These attributes continue to mould our martial tradition, assuring that, regardless of the obstacles that lie ahead, the soldiers of Bashkurdistan shall never be easily subdued.\n\n"
bkn_mil.1.a: "Interesting"

bkn_mil.2.t: "The First All-Bashkir Military Congress"
bkn_mil.2.d: "When the All-Bashkir Military Congress was held in 1919, convened by Commander of the Bashkir Host, Ähmätzäki Välidi, the situation of the national movement was disastrous. Despite the restoration of independent Bashkurdistan, the movement had been split. The achievements of democracy and the revolution had been virtually destroyed by the government of Kolchak, which had dissolved all autonomous regions under the slogan of a united and indivisible Russia. Some members of the Bashkir army had supported this, but others understood that this meant not only the end of autonomy but also the end of all aspirations of the Bashkir people. Gäräy Qaramyşev, Chairman of the Tulqyn Youth Organization, said at the Congress: \"The Bashkirs have more than once fought for their freedom with weapons in hand, and it is no fault of theirs that Russian historians have called each such event a 'rebellion'. This latest attempt at self-determination is the 88th in a series.\"\n\nIn an attempt to guarantee some degree of autonomy, Ähmätzäki Välidi committed a major misstep by declaring that in order to preserve Bashkurdistan, it would be necessary to align with the Soviet government and launch a guerrilla campaign against Kolchak's forces. Unfortunately, by the time this decision was made, the Soviet forces had already been pushed back hundreds of kilometers away from Bashkurdistan.\n\nThe First All-Bashkir Congress effectively marked the end of Bashkir autonomy. Shortly thereafter, the Bashkir government was disbanded by Kolchak's forces, and its leaders were forced into exile. Today, amidst the dawn of a new independent republic, members of the congress are meeting once again to discuss strategies for ensuring the survival of their people."
bkn_mil.2.a: "We must survive this time."

bkn_mil.3.t: "The Second All-Bashkir Military Congress"
bkn_mil.3.d: "The opening of the congress in Ufa is primarily linked to the new leadership of the Bashkir armed forces, represented by General Ğalimyän Tağan. As a hero of the civil war, he remains a controversial figure for many. Having chosen to remain on the White side during the first all-Bashkir military congress, Tağan is seen by some as a traitor to the interests of the Bashkir people.\n\nTağan ended the war not in his homeland, but under Afrikan Bogaevsky's command in the Southern Army. While the decision to remain with the Whites in the end may have been better than joining the Soviets, the current situation is different. Many nationalists within the general staff fear that if the whites win, autonomy will again be abolished. If the Soviets prevail, hated Bolshevism or another form of socialism will undermine the achievements of Bashkir democracy.\n\nIn this regard, the Congress has been instructed to develop a comprehensive modernization plan for the Bashkir armed forces, which should prepare both the military and the country's economy for all eventualities. The recent discovery of oil reserves in Ishembay is driving the creation of a new type of military unit that is prepared for war: an aviation and armored vehicles. Although both branches will be developed, it is necessary to determine a priority direction."
bkn_mil.3.a: "We must focus on aviation"
bkn_mil.3.b: "We must focus on armored vehicles"

bkn_mil.4.t: "Confidence in Tağan"
bkn_mil.4.d: "The new government has raised concerns regarding the resignation of Tağan from his position. The government has accused him of siding with the Great Russian chauvinist movement and thereby betraying the trust of the people of Bashkurdistan.\n\nAs a replacement, it has been proposed to appoint Mohammathan Qulayev, a retired general who has supported the unsuccessful transition to the Soviet government but has justified his actions by stating that the transition never actually occurred. Qulayev resided in Kazan after the war and has since retired from active politics, making him suitable for conducting a neutral policy in the best interests of Bashkurdistan, according to the government.\n\nMeanwhile, Välidi has actively promoted his candidate for the position of Härbi Shurahy, Usman Tereğolov, who fought alongside him on the anti-Bolshevik front in Turkestan."
bkn_mil.4.a: "Appoint Qulayev."
bkn_mil.4.b: "Appoint Tereğolov."

bkn_mil.5.t: "The opening of the congress in Ufa is primarily linked to the new leadership of the Bashkir armed forces, represented by General Musa Mortazin. As a hero of the civil war, he remains a controversial figure for many. Having chosen to join the Red side during the first all-Bashkir military congress, TaMortazinğan is seen by some as a traitor to the interests of the Bashkir people.\n\nMortazin ended the war not in his homeland, but in emigration, together with Shärif Manatov. While the decision to join the Reds in the end may have been better than remaining with the Whites, the current situation is different. Many nationalists within the general staff fear that if the Whites win in a new war, autonomy will again be abolished. If the Soviets prevail, hated Bolshevism will undermine the achievements of Bashkir revolutionary democracy.\n\nIn this regard, the Congress has been instructed to develop a comprehensive modernization plan for the Bashkir armed forces, which should prepare both the military and the country's economy for all eventualities.

bkn_mil.6.t: "Logistical Breakdown"
bkn_mil.6.d: "The wheels of our military machine grind to a halt as severe mismanagement and resource shortages wreak havoc on the supply chains. Reports from the frontlines describe soldiers left without ammunition, food, or medical aid, while warehouses remain disorganized and stockpiles mysteriously disappear. The army’s confidence in its leadership is at an all-time low, and urgent action is required to prevent total chaos."
bkn_mil.6.a: "Blame mid-level officers!"

bkn_mil.7.t: "Shadows in the General Staff"
bkn_mil.7.d: "Whispers of corruption within the military bureaucracy have turned into undeniable evidence. High-ranking officials have been caught embezzling funds meant for soldiers’ wages and equipment. The scandal not only damages the army’s operational capacity but also sparks a wave of public outrage. If this rot isn’t cut out swiftly, it may permanently undermine the army’s cohesion."
bkn_mil.7.a: "Investigate deeper before acting."

bkn_mil.8.t: "Veteran Demonstrations"
bkn_mil.8.d: "Disillusioned veterans, many of whom served as the backbone of Bashkurdistan’s military traditions, have taken to the streets in protest. They criticize recent reforms, claiming the military is abandoning its heritage in favor of impractical modern doctrines. Their actions have drawn significant public attention, dividing the nation and threatening military cohesion."
bkn_mil.8.a: "Appease the veterans with concessions."
bkn_mil.8.b: "Condemn the protests and move forward."

bkn_mil.9.t: "Tatar Occupation of [1197.GetName]"
bkn_mil.9.d: "In January 1918, a congress of residents of the region was held in [1197.GetName], where the majority of attendees voted for Bashkurdistan. As a result, the first decree was passed establishing the \"Department of Bashkir Language and Culture\" in [1197.GetName].\n\nAt the same time, the Milli Majlis of the Turkic Tatars of Inner Russia and Siberia, the coordinating body for the Idel-Ural State, sent a message to the attendees of the meeting, presumably encouraging them to support the integration of Bashkirs into Idel-Ural. This action helped to garner the necessary support for the idea in [1197.GetName], leading to the public declaration of \"Bashkurdistan joining Idel-Ural\", at least in theory.\n\nHowever, the Idel-Ural state never actually existed, it was merely declared and never controlled any territory, in contrast to Bashkurdistan and the Bashkir government. Regrettably, this deception initiated by the Tatars enabled them to claim [1197.GetName]. Subsequently, the [1197.GetName] Congress was dissolved by the Kazan Workers' and Soldiers' Council, dispatched from Kazan.\n\nNow, with the emergence of independent Tatar and Bashkir states on the world stage, taking advantage of our vulnerability during our struggle for Belebey and Ufa, the Tatar militia seized [1197.GetName] under the pretext of being a legitimate part of their republic. We should not simply allow this to stand."
bkn_mil.9.a: "[1197.GetName] will return to Bashkurdistan!"

bkn_mil.10.t: "Unrest in [1197.GetName]"
bkn_mil.10.d: "The streets of [1197.GetName] have been the scene of protests. Bashkir demonstrators, waving blue-white-green flags, marched through the city centre, criticizing the [GetRulingParty] government and calling for the reunification with [BKN.GetName]. Recent political turmoil in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] has reduced the central government's authority over border regions, encouraging dissent in areas like [1197.GetName] that are disputed.\n\n[1197.GetName], which was once part of the Ufa Governorate, holds deep historical and cultural significance for the Bashkir people. Nevertheless, our claim to this region is also justified: In January 1918, a Muslim congress took place in the [1197.GetName] region, during which most delegates supported the idea of Bashkurdistan. Consequently, the Milli Majlis of the Turkic Tatars in Inner Russia and Siberia, a coordinated institution of the Idel-Ural state, sent a telegram to congress delegates, supposedly urging them to support the incorporation of the Bashkirs into Idel-Ural. This move helped to garner the necessary support in the [1197.GetName] area, leading to [1197.GetName]'s at least verbal \"Bashkiria joining the Idel-Ural\"\n\nAt present, despite protests from the Bashkirs, the situation in the region is under our control. Tatar paramilitary forces patrol the outskirts of the city, and any interference could lead to serious repercussions."
bkn_mil.10.a: "Suppress these protests until [BKN.GetLeader] intervenes!"
bkn_mil.10.b: "It's better to give them a little autonomy."

bkn_mil.11.t: "Suppression of the Bashkir Revolt in [1197.GetName]!"
bkn_mil.11.d: "The streets of [1197.GetName], which recently echoed with shouts of protest, have now fallen into a ominous silence. Tatar militia, reinforced by additional forces from Kazan, has brutally suppressed the Bashkir insurrection in the region. What began as peaceful protests calling for the reintegration of [1197.GetName] into Bashkurdistan, following several weeks of tensions and provocations, has escalated into armed resistance. Barricades have been erected, and gunfire has been exchanged as Bashkir rebel forces engage Tatar troops in the alleys.\n\nThis conflict traces its roots back to history. [1197.GetName], a city of significant symbolic importance, served as the focus of attention during the 1918 Muslim Congress, where Bashkir nationalists advocated for our national state. However, Tatar leaders managed to sway local sentiment in favor of the larger Idel-Ural initiative, although it remained only in theory, as did the Idel-Ural state itself. Decades later, this unresolved issue has led to bloodshed.\n\nThe decisive measures taken by the Tatar authorities have thus far suppressed the unrest, albeit at a significant cost. Reports of civilian deaths and harsh repression have sparked criticism from nationalists within our state, while the government now faces a critical question: should it let this matter rest or use this incident as an opportunity to intensify its efforts in Menzelinsk?"
bkn_mil.11.a: "We stand with our people in [1197.GetName] — Bashkurdistan does not forget its own." #-> 12
bkn_mil.11.b: "Let us approach this crisis with wisdom, not force."
bkn_mil.11.c: "The time is not right — Menzelinsk will remain patient."

bkn_mil.12.t: "Bashkir Ultimatum"
bkn_mil.12.d: "Tensions between us and [BKN.GetName] have reached a boiling point. Fueled by mounting unrest and nationalistic fervor, the Bashkir government has sent an ultimatum to Kazan: withdraw all Tatar forces from [1197.GetName] and cede the region to Bashkurdistan peacefully within 48 hours.\n\nThe ultimatum has sparked fierce debate within our government, but we should answer it."
bkn_mil.12.a: "[1197.GetName] is Tatar land, and we will not be coerced into surrender." #-> 13
bkn_mil.12.b: "For the sake of peace, we will relinquish Menzelinsk." #-> 14

bkn_mil.13.t: "March to [1197.GetName]!"
bkn_mil.13.d: "The Tatar government has refused our ultimatum, prompting a decisive response. The Bashkir General Staff has ordered a full mobilization of troops along the border. Commanders rally their men, determined to reclaim [1197.GetName] by force. Meanwhile, reports indicate that the Tatar military is digging in, preparing to defend the contested region at all costs."
bkn_mil.13.a: "Höjümgä!"

bkn_mil.14.t: "Victory in [1197.GetName]!"
bkn_mil.14.d: "The Tatar government has acceded to our demands, withdrawing their forces from [1197.GetName] and ceding the region without conflict. The Bashkir flag now flies over the contested town, and jubilant celebrations erupt across the nation. While this bloodless victory is a major win for Bashkir nationalism, it has left Tatarstan deeply humiliated. Tatar leaders vow that they will not forget this slight, and tensions between the two nations remain dangerously high."
bkn_mil.14.a: "Hooray!"

bkn_mil.15.t: "Negotiations Over [1197.GetName]"
bkn_mil.15.d: "Rather than risk the uncertainty of war, the Bashkir government has extended an olive branch to us, inviting our representatives to negotiate the future of [1197.GetName]. The Bashkir delegation presents their terms, arguing that [1197.GetName] rightfully belongs to Bashkurdistan due to historical ties and cultural connections. However, the terms also include economic and security guarantees for us to sweeten the deal."
bkn_mil.15.a: "This is a fair proposal, and peace must prevail."
bkn_mil.15.b: "We cannot accept these terms as they stand. Let us propose a compromise."
bkn_mil.15.c: "Your demands are unacceptable. [1197.GetName] will remain Tatar land."

bkn_mil.16.t: "A Counteroffer From [FROM.GetName]"
bkn_mil.16.d: "Tatar negotiators have countered with their own demands, attempting to retain influence in [1197.GetName] while avoiding a full territorial concession."
bkn_mil.16.a: "Accept the counteroffer."
bkn_mil.16.b: "Reject the counteroffer."

bkn_mil.17.t: "[FROM.GetName] Accepts!"

bkn_mil.19.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] delegation has refused our terms."
bkn_mil.19.a: "We must get ready for possible escalation."

bkn_mil.20.t: "The Future Runs Through Zlatoust"
bkn_mil.20.d: "The city of Zlatoust, located at the edge of the Ural Mountains, represents not only a strategic location but also a symbol of the Bashkir heritage and an important gateway for industrial development. As a historically part of the Bashkir lands, the population of Zlatoust remains a blend of Bashkirs and Russians, and its rich mineral resources and steel production facilities serve as a vital economic hub for the region.\n\nFor the government, the significance of the city extends beyond national pride. Control over Zlatoust would provide Bashkurdistan with critical resources such as iron and steel, essential for industrial and military growth. The city's skilled workforce and advanced industrial infrastructure will form the backbone of a modernized economy and defense forces."
bkn_mil.20.a: "Prepare a plan to seize Zlatoust."

bkn_mil_21.t: "Bashkir Government Seized Zlatoust!"
bkn_mil_21.d: "The nationalist Bashkir 'government' has now moved across the Ural range and seized the city of Zlatoust with its rich mineral resources and steel production facilities."
bkn_mil_21.a: "We will retake it anyway."

BKN_Qadhimist_Bashkiria_desc: "For centuries, the Bashkir people have drawn strength from Islam unimpeded by modernists and reformers. This proud tradition, essential for the cohesion and well-being of the Muslim community, stands on the backbones of the Mullahs and Imams who form the foundational designs of the nation.

By establishing a specialized department near the mountains, where officers will be selected for training, and by selecting local soldiers, as well as by conducting an active campaign to attract the local population to the mountain units, we expect to create 2 regiments.

Despite the Pan-Turkic trend, common language and customs, relations between Bashkirs and Tatars could be described as strained at best. The dominant Tatar bourgeoisie in trade and entrepreneurship has encountered the Bashkir semi-nomadic military and nationalistic way of life.\n\nThus, there is now little unity left. Almost all political movements in Bashkurdistan take the stance of Bashkir nationalism and opposition to \"Tatar domination\" in culture and economics. The influential Tatar lobby can significantly influence the country's affairs, and if action is not taken, the dream of Bashkir independence and development may be lost.\n\nRight now, the §mInfuence of Tatar lobby§! is §R[?BKN.party_popularity@market_liberal|0%]§!"

In 1897, the Lower-Avzyanopetrovsky factory burned down, and the Upper-Avzyanopetrovsky plant was purchased by the Ural-Volga Metallurgical Society. From 1900 to 1918, control over the plant passed to the management of the Komarovsky iron ore deposits and South Ural mining plants. Following the revolution, the factories were nationalized and remained under state ownership. They are now also under the management of the Bashkir government."

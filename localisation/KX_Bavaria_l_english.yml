BAY_NATPOP_START:0 "Realm of South Germany"
BAY_NATPOP_START_desc:0 "We have finally brought the country some semblance of stability again-at least part of it. Now we must look to our future. As the united regions of South Germany, we stand in an advantageous position, but will it be enough to secure our position on the international stage?"

BAY_NATPOP_EMPOWER_MONARCHY:0 "Empower Rupprecht"
BAY_NATPOP_EMPOWER_MONARCHY_desc:0 "Rupprecht, of the house Wittelsbach, has offered hope for Germany. Under his steady hand, we would prosper as we did under the old Kaisers. However, to achieve the power he needs to do so, we must grant it to him. It is not a decision we take lightly, but it is the right thing to do; we must empower Rupprecht."

BAY_NATPOP_CRACK_DOWN_ON_THE_LEFT:0 "Cracking down on Leftists"
BAY_NATPOP_CRACK_DOWN_ON_THE_LEFT_desc:0 "Syndicalism was a leading force in many of the recent disasters that have befallen Europe; first in Russia, then in France, and now in Germany itself. The leftist menace must be snuffed out, and if we fail, we may disappear from history entirely. For the German people, we must crack down on these extremists."

BAY_NATPOP_RALLY_THE_RIGHT:0 "Rallying the Right"
BAY_NATPOP_RALLY_THE_RIGHT_desc:0 "Germany was always a conservative nation, proud of its traditions and heritage. True Germans will rally around a leader who promises stability and security to their people, and we must rally all such people to our cause."

BAY_NATPOP_BAN_PARTIES:0 "Ban all Parties"
BAY_NATPOP_BAN_PARTIES_desc:0 "The very idea of political parties breeds instability in a nation. To restore order, we must eliminate the institution entirely. With these meddling cliques out of our way, we can move forward with the task of restoring our former might in Europe."

BAY_NATPOP_DEPLOY_PARAMILITARY:0 "Deploy Paramilitaries"
BAY_NATPOP_DEPLOY_PARAMILITARY_desc:0 "In the wake of the civil war, there are millions of veterans who suddenly find themselves out of work. To ameliorate this problem, we must bring these soldiers to bear in new paramilitaries. This will simultaneously solve our unemployment problems while also giving soldiers a purpose again..."

BAY_NATPOP_NEW_SOUTH_GERMANY:0 "A New South Germany"
BAY_NATPOP_NEW_SOUTH_GERMANY_desc:0 "We have worked tirelessly towards the achievement of this new state, and finally it has been realized. South Germany will be stronger than ever before, and for the first time in over a thousand years, the whole of the region will be unified and under its own control."

BAY_NATPOP_CORPORATE_MONARCHY:0 "A Corporate Monarchy"
BAY_NATPOP_CORPORATE_MONARCHY_desc:0 "The corporation is an essential entity for the survival of the government, but we need them as much as they need us. Only by working together can we hope to achieve anything close to the greatness the Kaisers once enjoyed. So, together we shall be, for the future of the German people!"

BAY_NATPOP_NEW_MILITARY_INDUSTRY:0 "New Military Industries"
BAY_NATPOP_NEW_MILITARY_INDUSTRY_desc:0 "Industry is the key to any powerful modern state, and though Bavaria has never had the industry of the Rhineland, we must change this out of necessity. To match the needs of our growing military, we shall have a growing industry to create the arms and armaments that Bavaria's brave soldiers so desperately need!"

BAY_NATPOP_GIVE_THE_POOR_TO_WORK:0 "Give Jobs to the Poor"
BAY_NATPOP_GIVE_THE_POOR_TO_WORK_desc:0 "In our new nation, there are still many problems that demand attention. One of the primary problems is that of unemployment, especially among the poor. We must give all Germans a chance, and in doing so, we can continue to recover from the devastation of past years."

BAY_NATPOP_BAVARIAN_RAILWAY:0 "Build New Railways"
BAY_NATPOP_BAVARIAN_RAILWAY_desc:0 "If we ever hope to contend with our neighbors, we must first modernize our infrastructure. Germany was once at the forefront of railway technology in Europe, and Bavaria must follow in those footsteps. Further, we can use this to help our economy grow in the midst of global economic crisis."

BAY_NATPOP_RAPID_REBUILDING:0 "Rapid Rebuilding"
BAY_NATPOP_RAPID_REBUILDING_desc:0 "There is no time to wallow in the destruction wraught upon Germany in past years; we must rebuild. If we fail to repair our broken nation, we will be vulnerable to outside invasion-and it will only get worse with time. Time is of the essence, and so we will rebuild southern Germany."

BAY_NATPOP_PRIORIZE_THE_MILITARY:0 "Military First Policy"
BAY_NATPOP_PRIORIZE_THE_MILITARY_desc:0 "The concerns of national security must triumph over all else in our fragile country. After all, there will be many who seek to swallow us up into their own nations, or impose foreign systems upon us. We must stand strong as Bavarians!"

BAY_NATPOP_FAMILY_SUBSIDES:0 "Family Subsidies"
BAY_NATPOP_FAMILY_SUBSIDES_desc:0 "The German family as a unit was fractured in the recent wars in our country, and we must restore this institution. Just as we have for thousands of years, we must once more honor this sacred organization. The only way we can do so is providing families with what they need in the wake of such horrible devastation."

BAY_NATPOP_OUR_FUTURE:0 "Our Future?"
BAY_NATPOP_OUR_FUTURE_desc:0 "Every great nation faces a choice at one point or another in its history. Now, our nation stands at a crossroads. If we take the safer route of creating some sort of South German state, we will find success but must decide what that means. However, we could also pursue older, more ambitious dreams..."

BAY_NATPOP_FRANKISH_AMBITION:0 "Frankish Ambition"
BAY_NATPOP_FRANKISH_AMBITION_desc:0 "To pursue a better future for our nation, we must look to the past, to a nation that set itself above all others in Europe. Francia was unparalleled in its ability to unify Western Europe, and it was in those times that Bavaria was born for the first time. We must aspire to be something more, as the Carolingians did; we must bring the old empire back together."

BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_SWITZERLAND:0 "Destroy Switzerland"
BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_SWITZERLAND_desc:0 "For too long, the Swiss have acted independently of the rest of Germany, denying their common heritage. Their claims to neutrality are apparently no longer as serious as they once were, given their recent actions in France. We should take advantage of this break in their historical tradition and bring them into the fold."

BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_AUSTRIA:0 "Crush the Habsburgs"
BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_AUSTRIA_desc:0 "The Habsburg family existed almost as far back as the Frankish Empire, and yet their legacy has been one of failure and misery for the German people in Austria. There was once a time when Bavaria and Austria were united, when their realm was a mere border state in our wider nation...we will restore this state of affairs."

BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_GERMANY:0 "Retake our German Lands"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_GERMANY_desc:0 "Over a thousand years ago, Germany was barely civilized, a land of villages and warring tribes. More recently, it was the strongest empire in the world, but only when it was united. We must restore this unity, but this time, it will be under our rule. Only Emperor Rupprecht can fulfill the promise of a united Germany once more."

BAY_NATPOP_END_THE_FRENCH_MENACE:0 "Ending the French Menace"
BAY_NATPOP_END_THE_FRENCH_MENACE_desc:0 "Like its namesake in the Frankish Empire, the French have been integral to the history of Europe. There would be no Francia without France, and as they were our brothers in history, they will be our brothers once more. The French people chafe under the rule of godless syndicalists; we must end these radicals and bring France home!"

BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_NORTH_ITALY:0 "Take Back Rome!"
BAY_NATPOP_TAKE_NORTH_ITALY_desc:0 "After the Lombards seized Italy from Byzantine rule, it became clear they were not worthy of holding the ancient land. Only the Franks could bring this land to its rightful glory, as it did when the region was under Frankish rule. We will restore this control and march all the way to the old city of Rome..."

BAY_NATPOP_ATTACK_BENELUX:0 "Absorb the Benelux"
BAY_NATPOP_ATTACK_BENELUX_desc:0 "The Dutch, Walloonians, Flemish, and Luxembourgians all have one thing in common. They have all decided to forget their common heritage, weakening themselves and their neighbors and leaving themselves open to foreign domination. After all, who could forget their eighty year war for independence against Spain? They may not realize their state is under threat, but we will help them realize that they would be better off with us."

BAY_NATPOP_FRANCONIAN_EMPIRE:0 "The Frankish Dream Realized"
BAY_NATPOP_FRANCONIAN_EMPIRE_desc:0 "Pursuing a dream thought to be dead for over a thousand years, Emperor Rupprecht has finally brought the Frankish Empire back to life. The founding nation of Europe has once again been restored to its former glory, and will live on for time immemorial. Our people will never be divided again!"

BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_EURO_COLONIES:0 "Retaking our European Colonies"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_EURO_COLONIES_desc:0 "In the reign of Charlemagne, the Franks colonized various border regions in Europe. They pushed into Spain, beat back the Magyars, and routed the Slavs. Now, we must re-establish this policy of border regions. These regions will serve as important buffer states and make our realm all the more stronger. Along with these old Frankish claims, the Kaiser himself holds many claims under his belt, most notabe being his claim to the throne of the British Isles."
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_ASIAN_COLONIES:0 "Retaking the Asian Colonies"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_ASIAN_COLONIES_desc:0 "Only a few short years ago, Germany had the mightiest empire in history. Now, the ungrateful wretches in our old Asian colonies fancy themselves as independent. If we are to carry on where our predecessors left off, we must bring these wealthy regions back into our hands!"

BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_AFRICAN_COLONIES:0 "Restore our Place in Afrika"
BAY_NATPOP_RETAKE_AFRICAN_COLONIES_desc:0 "It is in the Dark Continent that the fate of Germany will be decided. If we are able to reimpose order there, we can count on their vast resources once more. Once we do that, there will be few limits to what we can achieve."

BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_GERMAN_AMBITION:0 "Dreams of a True South Germany"
BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_GERMAN_AMBITION_desc:0 "Though some in our nation dream of an independent Bavaria, others have much larger ambitions. The notion of unifying all South Germans has gained momentum recently, and it wouldn't be out of the question. After all, by bringing all the South Germans into one nation, we would match the might of the old North German Federation, and perhaps we could match their accomplishments as well."

BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_AUSTRIA:0 "Restore German Rule to Austria"
BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_AUSTRIA_desc:0 "Austria is fundamentally German. In fact, in the times of the Carolingians, we were united with them in one realm. We must restore that state of affairs and once more bring Austria home to its brothers."

BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_SWITZERLAND:0 "End the Swiss"
BAY_NATPOP_SOUTH_TAKE_SWITZERLAND_desc:0 "The renegade Swiss have troubled Europe with their 'neutrality' for too long. We know they are no longer neutral, and we must take advantage of that state of affairs. By bringing these true Germans into the fold, we will be one step closer to a true southern Germany."

BAY_NATPOP_THE_SOUTH_GERMAN_KINGDOM:0 "The South German Kingdom"
BAY_NATPOP_THE_SOUTH_GERMAN_KINGDOM_desc:0 "We have done the impossible; we have brought all South Germans under our control, a feat the German Empire could never accomplish. Now, we look to a future of prosperity, to a future as South Germany!"

BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_FUTURE:0 "Austrian Future"
BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_FUTURE_desc:0 "Our future necessarily lies in Austria; after all, we are brothers in blood and history. Though we will likely refuse any offer that would place Vienna in charge of our country, they are certainly welcome to join us..."

BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_THE_AUSTRIAN_ALLIANCE:0 "Joining the Austrian Alliance"
BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_THE_AUSTRIAN_ALLIANCE_desc:0 "The next best option beyond annexation is a close partnership with our brothers in the east. An alliance with the Austrians could help us achieve the greatness we lost in our civil war."

BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_AUSTRIA:0 "Formal Integration"
BAY_NATPOP_JOIN_AUSTRIA_desc:0 "An alliance is not enough; we must be united in one nation once more. With Austria united with its brothers in Germany, we will create a state superior to all the other successor states in the old German Empire."

BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_INVESTORS:0 "Invite Austrian Investors"
BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_INVESTORS_desc:0 "Though Austrian industry was often in the shadow of Germany's might, we could certainly benefit from their help now. By encouraging investment from Vienna and other sectors, we can build up our economy once more and salvage what is left from the civil war."

BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_OFFICERS:0 "Invite Austrian Officers"
BAY_NATPOP_AUSTRIAN_OFFICERS_desc:0 "Austria's army is maligned, perhaps unjustly, for its performance in the Weltkrieg. The reality is that Austrian officers were highly talented; it was non-Germans that held their military back. We should bring this talent into the fold to gain an advantage over our neighbors, and if we succeed, our potential will grow dramatically."

BAY_NATPOP_UNITE_GERMANY:0 "Unite Germany under our Rule"
BAY_NATPOP_UNITE_GERMANY_desc:0 "After a mere few years of division, it is already clear that our neighbors seek to feast off the carcass that is Germany. If anyone is going to protect the German people, it will be us. We must bring them all under our control, just as they were under the Kaiser, if we hope to maintain German sovereignty and freedom."

BAY_NATPOP_RECLAIM_FORMER_IMPERIAL_LANDS:0 "Reclaim the Former Imperial Lands"
BAY_NATPOP_RECLAIM_FORMER_IMPERIAL_LANDS_desc:0 "The German Empire was the most splendid nation on the face of the Earth once, but it could only be that way with the addition of its empire. It is crucial that these colonies be brought back under our control, and we will work towards this goal to restore the old superpower we once lived in."

BAY_SECURING_OUR_KINGDOM:0 "Securing Our Kingdom"
BAY_SECURING_OUR_KINGDOM_desc:0 "While we've managed to grow our lands to reach every southern son of Germany, we are still yet threatened. If we are to ensure our Kingdom does not fall as the Reich of old, it is necessary to secure our existence. The list of our enemies are vast, but if we wish to truly secure our future, we must strike first, before they get the chance."

BAY_DESTROY_NORTH_GERMAN_MENACE:0 "An End to the North German Menace"
BAY_DESTROY_NORTH_GERMAN_MENACE_desc:0 "Even with the South united, and stronger then ever, a large threat still lingers above us. In the ruins and chaos of the North, our old brethren still bicker, and still lay claims to our lands. Be it the Republicans in the Rhineland, the vile Syndicalists in Hamburg or the remnant of the Kaiserreich within Prussia, the menace in the north will not rest until Bavaria lies once more under their thumb. The only way to ensure our survival, and the failure of those who would see our downfall, we must march north, and crush these pretenders."

BAY_KILLING_THE_COMMUNARDS:0 "Gut The Communards!"
BAY_KILLING_THE_COMMUNARDS_desc:0 "With the North pacified and finally shattered for good, only one threat to our continued existence remains; the perfidious Communards in Paris. If it were not for their unholy interference, the Reich never would have fallen to civil war, and the Kaiser never would have taken his own life. For the betterment of all peoples, regardless of status or nation or class, we must put these rebellious workers back into place. Our armies shall carry a holy torch, and finally liberate the peoples of the Commune from themselves. Für Gott und Vaterland!"

northgermanypacified.1.t:0 "The Second North German Collapse"
northgermanypacified.1.d:0 "With the fall of the final North German state, the goals of our adventure North have been completed, and our men are free to return home, to the pure and holy South. Not wishing to spend the resources to maintain order and stability in the northern reaches of former Germany, our commanders, at the behest of King Rupprecht, have ordered a fall retreat south, seemingly to show the North what it's like to have your culture and people simply ignored. In the wake of this decision, things in the north have rapidly gone from worse to bad. Several new nation-states, even new claimants to the defunct nation of Germany have emerged.\n\nIn the lands of Prussia, the Kingdom has been pushed back to East Prussia, itself having fallen under the control of Viktoria Luise, who was hastily crowned as Queen following her brother's and the majority of her family going missing. Also from the ruins of Prussia has risen the German National State, a highly nationalistic state pent on reclaiming Germany, despite the seizure of old German lands by Poland and Lithuania. In Brandenburg, a new 'German' Republic has risen, claiming the legacy of the Rhenish Republic. In the furthest reaches of old Germany, Denmark has seized Schleswig-Holstein, in the name of keeping the canal open. To the west lies the final remnants of the Revolution, under Laufenberg and his highly nationalistic worker's state. In the Rhineland a corporate state under Gustav Krupp. Finally, both Silesia and Saxony have seized the chance and have formed new nation-states.\n\nWith the chaos in the North seemingly greater than ever, we can now rest easy, knowing our future is protected, for generations to come."
northgermanypacified.1.a:0 "Sic semper tyrannis!"

BAYCollapse.1.t:0 "Riots in Munich"
BAYCollapse.1.d:0 "Following our government's first attempts to curtail the growing leftist resistance that fights against King Rupprecht and the Bavarian Fatherland Front, those elements within Munich supportive of the resistance launched protests against our crackdowns. While initially peaceful, these crypto-syndicalists soon showed their true colors, as riots began the moment our brave police arrived to ensure the demonstration was peaceful. While mostly limited to the city center, the riots quickly spread outward, nearly consuming the entire city. Thankfully, a number of units of the Fatherland Front's paramilitary was nearby, and was able to help police units retake the city with limited damage. Already, our government is making ample use of the incident in propaganda, reminding the populace of the hell that was the civil war, and the hell that awaits us should the resistance become more than anything then a nuance."
BAYCollapse.1.a:0 "Bavaria will never fall to syndicalist invasion!"

BAYCollapse.2.t:0 "Towards a United Bavaria"
BAYCollapse.2.d:0 "With our recent attempts to invigorate and unite the various right-wing parties in Bavaria, everything from more right-leaning democrats to the more far-out groupings, to provide our people with a single vision, the parties of Southern Germany have never been closer and more united in propose. This being the case, many within the Fatherland Front have called for the complete merging of these groupings into a single entity, both to provide our people with a more cohesive voice but also to closer follow the example of Austria's Engelbert Dollfuss, one of the main inspirations for the Bavarian Fatherland Front. While normally these calls for unity would fall on deaf ears, as most within our government are happy enough to simply allow these groups legal existence and protection, their calls have reached the ears of the King, who has called upon his ministers to do as the group requests. Thus, following the King's call, all major right wing parties within Bavaria are to be merged with the Fatherland Front, to unite our people closer, in both Faith and policy. With our newfound unity, there is no doubt the perfidious leftists and democrats will be all the easier to find and crush."      
BAYCollapse.2.a:0 "Für Gott und Vaterland!"

BAYCollapse.3.t:0 "South Germany at a Crossroads"
BAYCollapse.3.d:0 "At long last, after so long a time rebuilding and reshaping the face of the South of Germany, we have finally done it. The Left and what remained of moderate democrats have been crushed, routed or incorporated into our regime. The people, full of pious faith and love of country, finally live in a realm where they can live and practice their Catholic faith, free from the oppression that marked the Reich of old. The government is more united and streamlined than ever before, and truly functions like the organic body that it should. Despite this being the case, with our people and realm finally pure, pious and whole, our future has never been more uncertain. For while our fair lands have become a model nation for all true Catholic states to follow, we are surrounded on nearly all sides. Be it the protestant vultures in the North, the perfidious syndicalists to the West, we are with few allies, with one expectation. To our south and east, the Habsburg Empire, one of the final bastions of Christendom, stands still strong. With so many enemies and nominally only friendly nations, we cannot sit still, not while our future is still at risk.\n\nWith this being the case, only three options are open to us going forward. The first option, and seemingly the most realistic, would be to ally with Austria. A strong Catholic power, Austria would be the perfect protector in the sea of European policies. However, due to the differences in governance between us and Austria, unless a friendly government or even Engelbert Dollfuss himself were in power, we would have no chance of joining them. Secondly, we could take a page from history, and seek to rebuild the Frankish Empire of Charlemagne, which was torn apart at his death. While obviously a radical move, the very fact that we would be following Charlemagne's footsteps would mean that the Blessed founder of the Holy Roman Empire would no doubt be praying for our success. The final option before us is that of following a policy of uniting the desperate Southern Germanic population. Be it those in Austria or in Switzerland, the Southern German people have long cried for unity, and we are now in a position to finally allow this to occur, blessed unity for our peoples, under God and the King's holy light.\n\nRegardless of our decision, Bavaria and the Southern German lands shall be forever changed by it. May God guide us in critical hour!"
BAYCollapse.3.a:0 "For the future of the nation, we must choose with care."

BAYCollapse.4.t:0 "Crowning of Emperor Rupprecht I"
BAYCollapse.4.d:0 "Today is a crowning moment in the life of Rupprecht Wittelsbach, as today is the day he is set to be crowned as Emperor of the Franks. Though Charlemagne was technically styled as the Emperor of the Romans, the adoption of the title 'Emperor of the Franks' will nonetheless serve as a callback to those times. Now, his coronation will take place, and Rupprecht will officially take his rightful place as emperor. As part of the ceremony, a bishop will bestow the new Reichskrone on Rupprecht, officially making him the emperor and giving him unquestionable legitimacy in the eyes of all. The ceremony has also taken inspiration from that of Kaiser Wilhelm I in 1871, and military bands have paraded around Munich to mark the coronation. Further, all attendants were required to shout 'His Majesty, Kaiser Rupprecht’. The ruler will now be titled 'Rupprecht I' and will soon receive the fealty of nobles in the realm as well, with Rupprecht I also expressing interest in dubbing ceremonies for knights or other prestigious figures in the realm."
BAYCollapse.4.a:0 "A splendid day in our history!"

BAYCollapse.5.t:0 "The Seven Weeks' War Avenged"
BAYCollapse.5.d:0 "After a long, brutal and bloody series of wars and conflict, the end we have been fighting for has finally come, and Germany once more stands united. With our gallant allies within the Habsburg Empire greatly aiding us, many have noted the historic connection between the various religious wars in our past between the Protestant north and Catholic south. Unlike in the past however, the True Faith has finally triumphed, and Germany once more finds herself at the Church's mercy. King Rupprecht is to be officially crowned as Kaiser of Germany with the Reichskrone which has long been held in Vienna as a trophy of sorts, now returned to her rightful owners. With Germany herself now united, the time has come for us to reassert ourselves in the world state, as the sword and shield of the Church."
BAYCollapse.5.a:0 "Once more, Germany falls under the sway of Holy Mother Church"

BAYCollapse.6.t:0 "Triumph of the South Germans"
BAYCollapse.6.d:0 "With the worst of the struggles to unite our people now finally over, the realm of the South Germans, existing from Bavaria to Austria, is finally nearing the end of her bloody conquests. Our people finally stand united, and ready to take on the world. With our nation now fairly secured, King Rupprecht is to be crowned Kaiser Rupprecht I, emperor of the Southern German Empire. Using the Reichskrone secured from Vienna, Rupprecht's second coronation is set to be a lively affair, with many prominent nobles set to make an appearance. Besides his new found title, the newly crowned Kaiser is allegedly set to begin our final struggles against the Northern Menace, which has so long eyed our growing holy empire with envy. With war once more on the horizon, it appears that the Kaiser will not be content to just put the North in its place. If the rumors are true, Rupprecht plans to lead our troops against the Commune of France itself! Regardless, our people are finally nearly united under one State, one God and one Kaiser."
BAYCollapse.6.a:0 "Long Live Rupprecht!"

BAYCollapse.7.t:0 "Foundation of the Bavarian Inquisition"
BAYCollapse.7.d:0 "With our rule secure, and the Fatherland Front finally able to implement it's social policy unmolested by any resistance, the government has come to the conclusion that the time is finally ripe to bring life to an age-old institution, the Inquisition. While the Inquisition has been in existence since before the Protestant Revolution, Bavaria herself has never been home to a proper and fully on Inquisition. This has changed today however, as both leaders of the Church and our own government leaders have agreed to allow the formation of a Bavarian Inquisition, answerable only to the Holy Father in Rome. The main task of the Inquisition shall be two-fold. Firstly, it shall ensure that those who claim the title of Catholic are truly what they say they are. Secondly, the Inquisition shall help us route out and purge Protestantism from the lands we shall no-doubt be conquering in the near future. With the Inquisition at our side, we can ensure Bavaria will remain strong and pure of faith, for ages to come."
BAYCollapse.7.a:0 "We shall keep, protect and strengthen the Faith, no matter the cost!"

BAYCollapse.8.t:0 "Towards the Corporatist Ideal"
BAYCollapse.8.d:0 "As the Realm of South Germany continues to solidify itself, the Bavarian Fatherland Front, our ruling party since the fall of the Reich, has finally been able to implement it's social program. A mix of nationalistic fervor, deep Catholic peity, heavy inspiration from Austria's own Fatherland Front, vague Carlist influences and just a dash of Portuguese Integralism, the BFF' s program, in essence, is quite similar to her related parties. Economically, the BFF calls for the transformation of the economy into a class collaborationist, highly decentralized 'third-positionist' model, heavily based on the late Holy Father Pius XI's teachings with a strong focus on building up the armed forces. Politically and socially, the Fatherland Front in essence seeks to create a truly Catholic state, where every action of the State is soaked and versed in Catholic teaching, social or otherwise. The ideal structure for this reality, in the minds of the BFF, is within a highly decentralized Monarchy, essentially reestablishing the medieval order, reformed and updated for the modern era of course. While their plans are highly ambitious, with nigh unlimited power and their fingertips and the complete support of the King, it appears their dream may just become reality."
BAYCollapse.8.a:0 "Slowly but surely, Bavaria shall be a true Corporatist realm."


BAYCollapse.10.t:0 "A Trip to Munich"
BAYCollapse.10.d:0 "Since the formation of our alliance with Austria, Kaiser Karl and along with him Minsterprasident Engelbert Dollfuss have both expressed interest in visiting our fair realm. While these wishes have long been for naught, due to the internal chaos that has plagued both of our fair states, it has just been announced that the Kaiser shall be visiting Munich in a few short days, for a week-long tour of South Germany and her countryside. While not much has been publicly reveled about the trip of the two most important men in Austria for safety reasons, it has been confirmed that the two will be making a trip to the Pilgrimage Church of Wies on their journey.  Along with seeing the sights, this will be the first time Kaiser and King have met since the inspection of our alliance, and the two are expected to have a long talk, both about the future of our realms and their shared interests in the Faith."
BAYCollapse.10.a:0 "We are proud to welcome these two pillars of Christendom!"


BAYCollapse.11.t:0 "Austrian Cultural Influences"
BAYCollapse.11.d:0 "With the advent of our pact with Osterreich, the old national boundaries that separated our peoples for so long, while not coming down, have been greatly reduced. With this, trade between our nations has flourished, but it has had another side effect. As trade and Austrian tourism and immigration rise, so too does Austrian culture slowly seep into our fair lands. While Austria and Bavaria have long had a shared culture, being the two largest catholic Germanic states, both have developed their own unique culture and identity over the years. Now, it is not uncommon for Austrian music, Austrian wines, Austrian foods or even Austrian greetings to be heard or seen around our lands.  At the same time, it is not common for the reverse to be true as well, our own culture is having an effect and reverberance within Austria proper. While some hardliners in the Fatherland Front have called for us to end this 'deep disregard and disrespect' for Bavarian culture, most within the government are happy enough to keep the status quo. Austrian wines are cheaper than German ones after all..."
BAYCollapse.11.a:0 "Friends always share, and Austria and us are no different."




BAYCollapse.13.t:0 "The Matter of Frankish Succession"
BAYCollapse.13.d:0 "Though it is early in Rupprecht I's reign, it is incumbent upon us to decide what the succession will look like. The illustrious Charlemagne split his realm among his sons when he died; this was a way to ensure all his sons were given an equal inheritance. It seems unlikely that we will pursue such a system again; after the recent fracture in the nation, nobody wants to see the country split further. Instead, royal primogeniture is an alluring option, though some argue that succession should be as it was in the Holy Roman Empire. What path shall we travel down?"
BAYCollapse.13.a:0 "Royal Primogeniture is the way!"
BAYCollapse.13.b:0 "Decide upon new Prince-Electors!"

BAYCollapse.14.t:0 "The Great Lords of the Realm"
BAYCollapse.14.d:0 "The Merovingians and Carolingians would be nothing without the great lords who served them. In the Holy Roman Empire, great lords served as electors who were allowed to decide who the next emperor would be. So, it is clear that if we are to emulate the opulence of our forefathers, we must identify the strongest lords and dukes in our realm and perhaps even identify them as electors. However, if we choose new families, the old elector families will surely complain about being left out. We must decide whether we will give this prestige to the old lords who earn it based on lineage, or the new lords who earn it based on their power and wealth. What should we do? "
BAYCollapse.14.a:0 "The old families will remember the House of Wittelsbach!"
BAYCollapse.14.b:0 "The emperor must recognize his powerful vassals!"

BAYCollapse.15.t:0 "Securing the Reichskrone"
BAYCollapse.15.d:0 "For centuries, the Habsburg Reichskrone gave them legitimacy as emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. After the empire was tragically dissolved in 1806, the crown was kept in Vienna with other regalia until now. With Austria in our realm, and Rupprecht I ruling the country, it only makes sense for him to hold the crown himself. With this added touch, we will confer legitimacy upon our realm and perhaps induce some of our rebellious neighbors to come back into the fold, if necessary. Otherwise, it will serve as a tool to use on the international stage, as a way of comparing ourselves to other monarchs-though there is no equal to Rupprecht."
BAYCollapse.15.a:0 "A fitting crown for Rupprecht!"

BAYCollapse.16.t:0 "Restoration of the Siegestor?"
BAYCollapse.16.d:0 "In the German Civil War, the Siegestor, which has stood for nearly a century as a monument to the glorious Bavarian army, was heavily damaged. There are those who wish to restore the monument and make it more grandiose than ever before. These proponents also note that the statue atop the Siegestor was destroyed, and that perhaps one of Rupprecht I could be placed on top of the arch instead. Others, though, noting that we are Greater Southern Germany now rather than just Bavaria, argue that a new monument should be built in its place. These arguments largely entail an arch that would surpass the Brandenburg Gate and make it clear to the world where the center of the German people is located. Regardless of what we do, we have the funding necessary to build a fantastic monument. So, we stand at a crossroads...what will we do?"
BAYCollapse.16.a:0 "A new Siegestor for Rupprecht I!"
BAYCollapse.16.b:0 "Let us build a new monument for South Germany!"

BAYCollapse.17.t:0 "A Ballad for Bavaria"
BAYCollapse.17.d:0 "In celebration of our glorious achievements lately, Rupprecht I has called on the greatest lyricists and literary artists in Germany to create a new 'Ballad for Bavaria'. It is said that it should be a story about Rupprecht I or perhaps about Germany itself, and how despite the recent difficulties our people have had to go through, we will prevail nonetheless. The process will be a sort of contest, with the best piece being chosen to serve as the ballad, though the author will of course be unknown. With Bavaria and Austria in one realm, we have a nation that has produced the most brilliant music and art on Earth, unparalleled by any other nation. We should make the world aware of this fact."
BAYCollapse.17.a:0 "We will hope for a ballad about Rupprecht I!"
BAYCollapse.17.b:0 "We will hope for a ballad about the resilience of the German people!"


BAYCollapse.18.t:0 "The Fate of Karl I"
BAYCollapse.18.d:0 "Karl I, the former emperor of Austria and now living in our realm, must be handled in one way or another. The only question is how we will do so; he could serve us faithfully as a noble and give our realm legitimacy, but he might also be a threat. This does not have to be by his own hand; his mere presence around people brings the legitimacy of our fragile realm into question. After all, why shouldn't Austria be independent, or at least serve as the rulers of our new nation? Therefore, we must now decide what to do with the elderly and deeply pious Habsburg."
BAYCollapse.18.a:0 "Allow him to retain some power as a noble"
BAYCollapse.18.b:0 "Place him under house arrest"
BAYCollapse.18.c:0 "Strip him of his titles and send him into exile"

POLITICS_GEORGE_DESC:0 "Born 3 June 1865, the second son to the future Edward VII, there was little expectation that George Windsor would become King and as such he was destined for a career in the navy. But following the death of his older brother to influenza in 1892, he was made Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the throne, ending his naval career. Having grown close during the shared period of mourning for his brother, George would marry Princess Mary of Teck, his brother's fiancé and so would begin a loving, if little publicly expressed relationship. But his world would once again be thrown into turmoil when in 1911 his father would die, and George was forced to ascend to the throne as King George V. George had taken power at a politically turbulent time with the rising temper of the Irish Home Rule movement and the Liberals' growing conflict with the lords. While the constitutional crisis would ultimately see the reform of the Lords and a civil war temporarily averted in Ireland, the world would be cast into the fires of war as the Great War broke out with a despondent George at the helm. Despite his attempts to appease British nationalism by abandoning his German titles and adopting the name Windsor, Britain's loss in the Weltkrieg caused the already growing republican movement to experience a steady uptick in support. After years of poor governance and politicking, the British Revolution would break out and amid his dithering refusal to intervene in the political crisis, the King would be forced to flee Britain into exile and watch his home, along with his Empire, tumble into the abyss.\n\nThe King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has reigned over the British Empire, what's left of it, since his flight into exile. The loss of the Weltkrieg to his own cousin, the loss of his youngest son, John, and the final devastating loss of Britain itself have combined to break much of George V’s spirit despite his unending resolve to maintain his stature. With his health having worsened since the flight to Canada, which George privately refers to as “a frozen prison", he has gradually lost any interest in participating in domestic affairs, delegating such ceremonial duties as he may to his son, Prince Edward. He now lives on to spend what little time remains with his family and perhaps one day, the return to Britain, but this prospect grows dimmer by the day..."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "The first son of King George V, Edward VIII was born 23 June 1894 in the outskirts of London, named such after this late uncle. With a traditional childhood and tutoring, the young Prince was initially destined for a military schooling in the navy, first at Osborne and then Dartmouth. While a course of two years and entry into the navy was planned, this was cut short following his father's ascension to the throne. Preparations to prepare Edward for future leadership were started in earnest, being sent to Magdalen College at Oxford, despite allegations of being underprepared intellectually, ultimately leaving Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications. By the time of the Great War, Edward was of legal age to join and enthusiastically signed into the Grenadier Guards but was refused deployment to the frontlines in case the heir apparent be captured or killed. Nevertheless, he would travel to the frontlines as often as he could and undertook military flights from 1918 onwards, making him deeply popular among veterans for his eagerness to fight alongside them. But Edward would return to a country that was disillusioned by its defeat and suffering from economic depression, a fact Edward note on during his many tours of poverty-stricken areas of Britain to meet with local people and take on board their concerns. But despite his efforts to reach out to the common populace, Edward would be evacuated with his family to Canada in 1925 amid the British Revolution despite his proposal that he return to the frontlines to fight the syndicalist menace.\n\nIn exile, the young Edward would gradually take on many of the duties his father once performed, becoming a regent in all but name. But following his father's death, Edward of Windsor was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa, with all the pomp and circumstance afforded to his forebearers. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward has already proven himself prone to meddling in politics with his own radical views and a man of lustful scandal on par with Oswald Mosley. But he maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom will one day proudly fly above the Home Isles and the Empire shall be restored to its glory..."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC:0 "Prince Albert of Windsor, younger Brother of British king Edward VIII, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Canadians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Canadian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With Edward occupied with the reconstruction of the recently reconquered Britain, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Canada is properly governed."
POLITICS_ALBERT_DESC:0 "Born in December of 1895, the young Prince Albert was not expected to be a king. Growing up in Britain, he was always in the shadow of his brother, Prince Edward. Albert I was always known as a timid and reserved man, until near the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, when he attended an academy in 1909 and became a sailor in 1913. Despite constant seasickness, he served in the Battle of Jutland aboard the HMS Collingwood, and later served as a squadron leader until being injured in November of 1918, remaining in Britain for the rest of the war.\n\nAfter the war, Albert continued to live in Britain until the revolution, fleeing to Canada. The Prince was relatively irrelevant up until the rise of his brother as King, being next in line for the throne. Upon his brother’s abdication, the new King Albert I is seen as an equal if not better than his predecessor, as he is more willing to work with the Canadian government and British Exiles. Although the king suffers from constant sickness, he is seen as a beacon of hope by the British Exiles. For better or for worse, Albert I will lead the charge into the Home Isles."

POLITICS_DUNNING_DESC:0 "The first Prime Minister of Canada since Mackenzie Bowell to not be born on Canadian soil, Charles Avery dunning had served as premier of Saskatchewan before his transition into Federal politics. Dunning came to lead the Liberals after the party suffered from catastrophic losses in the 1926 election. Dunning, ushered in after the party leaders ditched longtime party leader William Lyon Mackenzie King, promised a renewed focus on Canadian sovereignty and a focus on helping Western Canada’s Agrarian core.\n\n Despite the Liberals picking fresh party leadership, the Conservatives would go on to hold a monopoly on power for almost 10 years straight. The Tories would only be brought down in 1935, with the Liberals narrowly winning a minority government. While Dunning has promised swift economic reforms and a focus on Canadian independence, Dunning’s actions in resolving Canada’s many crises have been unsatisfactory. Dunning’s solutions to the Great Depression have in many ways worsened the situation, all while Dunning is accused of selling out to the Exiles by many Liberals. Dunning, seen as an unpopular pseudo-Exile has lost the support of the majority of his party, and is seen by many as unlikely to solve the many problems plaguing Canada. The Liberals themselves look to Mackenzie King, the man Dunning replaced, for leadership, hoping that the party can rebound without Dunning’s unpopularity dragging them down. "
POLITICS_MACKENZIE_KING_DESC:0 "William Lyon Mackenzie King is no stranger to the challenges of being Prime Minister, serving previously from 1921 to 1926; and while he lost party leadership to Charles Avery Dunning, Mackenzie King continued to serve with grace as a influential cabinet minister. In a fit of irony, Dunning, who once usurped Mackenzie King, would eventually find himself undercut by King, and would eventually concede leadership to his former rival once it became clear that his position as Prime Minister was untenable.\n\n Mackenzie King has inherited quite the mess from his predecessor. The Canadian Economy is in shambles, the political scene has never been more divided, and conflict with the Union of Britain is brewing. Mackenzie King himself is determined to redefine the relationship between the British as one of equals, bringing a newfound focus on Canadian sovereignty and ensuring that the coming war with the Union of Britain will be a war to liberate and restore democracy to Britain, not as a subject reconquering the territory of their fallen masters. While he lacks charisma and has a personality described as ‘cold and tactless’, and while his obsession with various occult activities has worried some, Mackenzie King is just the man the Liberals need to get them through the years ahead; united and ready to ensure Canada’s place in the world stage.

It is hoped that the coming election will decide the issue once and for all. The Liberals, while barely 2 years into their term appear to be unable to solve these many problems to the satisfaction of Canadians, leading many to ponder the possibility of an unprecedented snap election.

CAN_expanded_training:0 "Expanded Training Program"
CAN_expanded_training_desc:0 "While short of full conscription, this expanded training program requires two years of mandatory military service for all eligible new adults, who will be called up for service in times of war.

The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."

CAN_kings_speech:0 "The King's Speech"
CAN_kings_speech_desc:0 "Edward, Prince of Wales, will be crowned king as the Canadian political landscape consists of two main factions: one led by Liberal Prime Minister Charles Avery Dunning and Mackenzie King, the other led by Conservative R.B. Bennett and the exiled British aristocracy. The Empire will be awaiting his radio address after the coronation, where he will be expected to declare his government's direction."
CAN_privy_council:0 "Status of the Privy Council"
CAN_privy_council_desc:0 "The British government-in-exile has acted on emergency powers since the country's downfall, wielding power only through its status as the king's Privy Council. It's been over a decade, however, and there are many who feel that the time has come for a change."
CAN_imperial_conference:0 "The Imperial Conference"
CAN_imperial_conference_desc:0 "There has not been a gathering of the Dominions since the fall of the Home Isles, but it's been decided that now is the time - even if Canada is at the head of the table, instead of the United Kingdom. The Dominions must prepare to work together if there is any hope of defeating the syndicalists."
CAN_fate_of_the_senate:0 "Fate of the [GetCANUpperHouse]"
CAN_fate_of_the_senate_desc:0 "The Canadian Senate was replaced with the House of Lords once the Kingdom of Canada was established. The House of Lords now consists of appointees by the sovereign, which - since the fall of the United Kingdom - have consisted almost entirely of British Exiles. Considering the [GetCANUpperHouse] has ultimate control over bills passed by the House of Commons, has the time come to finally restore the Senate? Or shall we pass reforms to the House of Lords."
CAN_draft_bill_c7:0 "Draft Bill C-7"
CAN_draft_bill_c7_desc:0 "With the election finally over, it is time for the government to concentrate on Bill C-7 - which will determine the country's approach to conscription, the military industry, and our national security. The debate will begin the moment it's introduced in the House of Commons, and will consume the government's attention until it is complete."

CAN_quebec_in_flames:0 "Québec in Flames"
CAN_quebec_in_flames_desc:0 "The patience of the Québecois with English Canada has finally hit a boiling point. Across the eastern province, demonstrations and even riots have broken down the fabric of social order... at a time when Canada can least afford it. Somehow, things must be set right."
CAN_montreal_conference:0 "The Montréal Conference"
CAN_montreal_conference_desc:0 "Suppressing the Québecois would be un-Canadian, as well as unhelpful. We must bring them to the table and discuss what it would take to have them take part willingly not only in this country but in its wars abroad."
CAN_official_bilingualism:0 "Official Bilingualism"
CAN_official_bilingualism_desc:0 "French has always been present in Canada as a second language, but the first and biggest demand of the Québecois is that it be made an official language - as important as English at every governmental level across the nation, and protected within the province of Québec itself."
CAN_new_quebec_status:0 "New Status for Québec"
CAN_new_quebec_status_desc:0 "To resolve the situation in Québec, we must amend their status within Confederation. They are not a province like any other, but have a unique status and thus unique requirements. Providing them greater powers over their own immigration policies and greater say over government policies that affect them directly will finally tell them we are serious about equality."
CAN_suppress_quebecois:0 "Suppress the Québecois"
CAN_suppress_quebecois_desc:0 "We have had enough. Understanding the interests of the Québecois is one thing, but letting them decide when they get to be part of this country and when to fight for it? It is beyond reason. If they wish to talk, it will be after the RCMP and the military have gone in to restore order."
CAN_promote_anglophones:0 "Empower the Anglophones"
CAN_promote_anglophones_desc:0 "Left unspoken is the significant presence of English Canadians within the province of Québec. Montreal is almost half-English, and all these people feel helplessly drawn into the conflict originating with the French. We must ensure they are not reduced to second-class citizens within their own country."
CAN_surete_du_quebec:0 "Sûreté du Québec"
CAN_surete_du_quebec_desc:0 "The time has come to rebuild the provincial police force in Québec, to make sure that it is capable of maintaining order and that it has full power to maintain surveillance over the French population. Once Québec and Canada are both at peace, perhaps we can begin to talk about French grievances."
CAN_war_measures_act:0 "Invoke the War Measures Act"
CAN_war_measures_act_desc:0 "The idea behind the War Measures Act is simple: in a time of war, the federal government has the right to suspend the rights of Canadian citizens. It must be able to take whatever actions it deems necessary, without impediment by normal democratic procedure, in order to prevent the breakdown of public order."
CAN_purge_the_opposition:0 "Control the House of Commons"
CAN_purge_the_opposition_desc:0 "A loyal opposition within the House of Commons is all well and good, but with the War Measures Act invoked we neither have the time nor inclination to engage in eternal debate and appease the endless outrage conjured by the Liberals. We must end the debate, so we can get to the business at hand."
CAN_assert_royal_prerogatives:0 "Dissolve Parliament"
CAN_assert_royal_prerogatives_desc:0 "The monarch has the seldom-employed ability to dissolve Parliament, if he sees fit. Given enough influence and popularity within Canada, this could be done without the expectation of a widespread revolt... and perhaps it should be done, if we are to have any chance of victory."

CAN_crown_corporations:0 "The Crown Corporations"
CAN_crown_corporations_desc:0 "Enterprises founded and run by the state, so-called 'Crown Corporations', allow us to develop and maintain access to strategic resources and expertise that might otherwise be neglected or ignored by the market. Sadly, not every industrial magnate sees the use of investing in wartime resources, at least for now."
CAN_cn_rail_expansion:0 "CN Rail Expansion"
CAN_cn_rail_expansion_desc:0 "Rail networks are the arteries of the nation of Canada, and none more so than the state-run Canadian National Railway. Expanding this network can only strengthen the nation, and it will surely prove crucial should we need to perform wartime supply and troop transport across the nation."
CAN_cp_rail_expansion:0 "CP Rail Expansion"
CAN_cp_rail_expansion_desc:0 "It was only the promise of a trans-continental rail network that brought the western provinces into the Dominion. Maintaining and expanding this network will help ensure our continued control over the region, and will serve us should we ever require large-scale fret between both seas."
CAN_invest_resources:0 "Invest in Natural Resources"
CAN_invest_resources_desc:0 "Much of the nation's wealth lies in its untapped natural resources. While prospecting and exploiting all those deposits hidden in Canada's wastes and wilderness will take time, we can take advantage of this natural bounty to ensure our strength and independence."
CAN_prairie_oil:0 "Prairie Oil Prospects"
CAN_prairie_oil_desc:0 "There has been small-scale drilling in the prairie provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan for some time. But perhaps there is more of this critical resource waiting for those who bother to look? Perhaps we might even be sitting on fields of oil that would rival those of the United States?"
CAN_explore_the_north:0 "Explore the North"
CAN_explore_the_north_desc:0 "Before we can mine it, we have to find it. While the large forests have long been explored by civilian prospectors, only state-funded geological expeditions will dare venture into the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions to identify the best sites for excavation and extraction."
CAN_create_iedc:0 "Create the [CANGetIEDCName]"
CAN_create_iedc_desc:0 "Suggestions have been made to form an Imperial Economic Development Council, to expand the industrial strength of the Entente by having its members work together on economic matters. Funded by Canada, the strongest remaining member of the Empire, the [CANGetIEDCName] would serve to help us meet the challenges ahead."
CAN_public_works:0 "Open Federal Relief Camps"
CAN_public_works_desc:0 "The Great Depression has not released its hold upon us yet - we still have hordes of unemployed men across the country, living in poverty or turning to crime. Our best answer is to gather these people together in 'economic relief camps'. There they will receive a wage and food to eat, and they can be put to use across the country as a ready labour force."
CAN_economic_recovery:0 "Economic Recovery"
CAN_economic_recovery_desc:0 "Finally our initiatives have borne fruit: the era of the Great Depression is over, and we can move forward into prosperity once more!"
CAN_national_housing_act:0 "National Housing Act"
CAN_national_housing_act_desc:0 "Housing is both a basic necessity and a major source of economic activity. By providing incentives for the construction and purchase of homes, we can create demand for key industries and promote expansion of the industrial economy as a whole."
CAN_polymer_corp:0 "Polymer Corporation"
CAN_polymer_corp_desc:0 "The Polymer Corporation, or Polycorp, is a crown corporation tasked with the development and production of new materials like nylon and synthetic rubber. These new materials will allow us to discover new ways to produce equipment that has until then proved a problem for our industry, making them cheaper and faster to produce."
CAN_create_isac:0 "Create the ISAC"
CAN_create_isac_desc:0 "A number of university presidents and scientific leaders meeting in Toronto have called for the formation of a new organisation to co-ordinate research among the member states of the Entente. The work of co-coordinating these links is to be carried out by the Imperial Scientific and Academic Council, located and funded by Canada, with contributions from the rest of the alliance."
CAN_national_research_council:0 "National Research Council"
CAN_national_research_council_desc:0 "The National Research Council was founded during the Weltkrieg to advise the Canadian government on science and research. By providing the organisation with additional funding and support we can expand our technology base to the benefit of both industry and military."
CAN_found_cbc:0 "Found the CBC"
CAN_found_cbc_desc:0 "A proposal has been put forward to expand the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission into a full-fledged national radio network called the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. This would help bring together a divided nation, and limit the influence of potentially subversive foreign broadcasts."
CAN_electronics_training:0 "Electronics Training Initiative"
CAN_electronics_training_desc:0 "We should take it upon ourselves to train a cadre of experts to man and maintain radios, RADAR and other modern electronic weapons of war. The RADAR is no simple technology, and we will need competent engineers and field operators to ensure our stations work at maximal efficiency, especially as we build more."
CAN_university_of_ottawa:0 "University of Ottawa"
CAN_university_of_ottawa_desc:0 "The University of Ottawa is one of Canada's oldest institutions of learning, and it is the facility that grew the most when the brightest minds from the United Kingdom fled to the country. That gathering of intelligentsia is something we should take advantage of with increased funding on government-approved projects."
CAN_we_need_industry:0 "We Need Industry"
CAN_we_need_industry_desc:0 "Our biggest need right now is to expand Canada's industrial base. It will never rival that of the Americans to the south, due to our smaller population, but we need to try."
CAN_we_need_munitions:0 "We Need Armaments"
CAN_we_need_munitions_desc:0 "We need factories to push out guns and bullets, in greater numbers than it was ever assumed possible... even if we need to build them from scratch."
CAN_we_need_ships:0 "We Need Ships"
CAN_we_need_ships_desc:0 "Our enemies are all across the ocean. We cannot rely on the ageing British ships to hold us over - we need to support our fleet and improve it, and replace lost ships as they fall."

CAN_expand_air_force:0 "Expand the Air Force"
CAN_expand_air_force_desc:0 "The Royal Canadian Air force fought with distinction during the Great War, but has long since suffered from serious neglect. We can no longer afford to fall behind in this critical area of warfare, lest we cede control of the sky to our foes, a terrifying prospect for sure."
CAN_airspace_defense:0 "The Night Watchmen"
CAN_airspace_defense_desc:0 "A proposal has been put forward by the NRC to construct a prototype radar warning system, code-name 'Night Watchmen'. In addition to its immediate strategic utility, this programme would provide enormous benefit to further research into RADAR technology and integration into air doctrine."
CAN_imperial_air_training_plan:0 "Imperial Air Training Plan"

However, our moment is coming soon; the red menace is actively harming our home and the Exiles are eager to reclaim their birthright.

Unfortunately, he wasn't as lucky when fighting the Spaniards in 1797. The expedition to Puerto Rico, while inflicting massive losses to the Spanish side, has cost him too and forced a withdrawal from San Juan.

While the American stole our rightful Territory back in 1844, fate has returned Oregon back to Canadian hands, sparing the citizens of the Pacific Northwest from the horrors of the Civil War. Now, with Oregon back in our hands, we can decide what to do with it; shall we merge the two Columbias? Shall we keep the American Borders? Shall we admit a new Province of Oregon? Their fate must be decided."

Among other things, the Manifesto calls for substantial reforms to the capitalist system, replacing it with a social-democratic Keynesian economy. While our coalition partners in the Liberal Party will likely not sign off on much of the [GetCCFName] platform, other chapters are significantly more likely to pass, such as the nationalization of transportation, communications, electrical power and other services, which we have convinced the Liberals as a smart investment to buy into these services at their current rock-bottom prices."

With the Social Democrat [GetCCFName] gaining seats in the last election they are concerned that the current system leaves too much open to interpretation and their 'Winnipeg Manifesto', of which nationalization is a key tenet, may take away their hard-earned land and businesses. As the Exiles comprise a significant portion of our voter base, it definitely wouldn't hurt to codify stronger property rights into law to ensure their votes in future elections, and make it more difficult for the [GetCCFName] to implement their Manifesto which is dangerously close to Syndicalism."

The government of Prime Minister Bennett is steadily moving to abandon ineffectual deregulatory policies, and embrace a more interventionist approach.

The Conservative government, in an attempt to make the exiles as comfortable as possible, has begun embracing this British cultural revival to its full extent, heading the push for many of Britain’s cultural amenities to be implemented in Canada.

canada.1.t:0 "The Fall of Britain"
canada.1.d:0 "It has been eleven long years since the collapse of the United Kingdom in 1925 and, in that time, the king, the remnants of the British government, and over a million of the Empire's best and brightest (and wealthiest) have fled to Canada... with the clear expectation that an invasion would soon be launched to take back the Home Isles from the syndicalist upstarts. It quickly became evident, however, that the syndicalist position was stronger than anticipated. Early forays were rebuked, and the last decade has seen the Union of Britain become solidified and entrenched.\n\n As the dream of a return to London faded from certainty like a dreamlike fancy, the remnants of the Old Britain had to take stock of their situation as it became clear that their stay in Canada might very well not be temporary. Canada soon gained independence, in a way, as the Dominion of Canada was replaced with the Kingdom of Canada, the Governor-General replaced with the Crown wholesale, the Senate replaced with the House of Lords, and the Red Ensign dyed Blue to avoid confusion with the Syndicalists. The Exiles, as they're called in Canada, have tried to make Canada their home; however the many differences between the Aristocratic culture of the old United Kingdom and the American inspired culture of Canada became clear. In the minds of many, Canada, founded as the merger of two distinct identities, now represents three: The French Canadians, the Anglo Canadians, and the British Exiles. To many, the ‘King of Canada’ only represents one of those three nations. Left adrift, the Exiles are determined to take back their homeland; however ultimately facing the grim political reality that this may never happen."

canada.2.t:0 "The Political Situation"
canada.2.d:0 "While initially welcomed with open arms by Canadians, the notion this might be a long-term arrangement has been an increasingly unpleasant one. Fingers were pointed and blame laid on those who were deemed responsible for the collapse and the subsequent inability to rectify matters, and resentment against Exiles who were seen as 'a higher class' in the Dominion as well as above the law has been growing. The Liberal Government of Mackenzie King collapsed in 1926, only to be replaced by almost 10 unbroken years of Conservative domination with the help of the Exiles. Mackenzie King himself was replaced by Charles Avery Dunning as leader of the Liberal Party, which defined itself with a renewed focus on the Farmers and a promised focus on Canadian sovereignty and keeping the British government-in-exile at arm's length rather than acting as if nothing had changed in the relationship. Fueled by discontent by the Exiles, and by the Conservative mismanagement of the Great Depression, the Liberals eventually would go on to win a narrow victory in 1935, breaking the Conservative monopoly on power and giving the Liberals a minority in the House of Commons. "

canada.3.t:0 "Our Current Situation"
canada.3.d:0 "While the Liberals captured the Prime Ministership, their victory came with strings attached, as the government has been unable to wield a sizable majority, and has been hindered at every step by Exile interference. On top of the tribulations of the Great Depression, there is growing criticism that little progress has been made in resolving the political situation. Indeed, it seems like Prime Ministers Dunning's attempts to solve the Great Depression have instead exacerbated the situation.\n\n Prime Minister Dunning is reviled by many Liberals, who see him as selling out to the Exiles, and the Exiles, who see him as a flip-flopper on the issue of Reclamation. Dunning himself, as a representative of the Farmers of Western Canada is unable to find a wedge of popularity in a Canada dominated by a new, predominantly East-Coast Exile class.\n\n George V lies on his deathbed, unwilling to interfere in political affairs and jeopardize Canada’s fragile political situation. While the old King is too apathetic to clash with the government, his son and heir Edward clashes often with the Liberals, and the Canadian public appears split between those who would see matters come to a head and those who would prefer to abandon their ties to the crown and the French exiles in Africa both.\n\n The Conservatives, bitter and energized by Dunning’s incompetence have looked to Richard Bedford Bennett: the leader of the party since Arthur Meighen surrendered leadership after 1935’s losses. Bennett promises swift economic reform and reconciliation with the exiles, and promises to do anything necessary to ensure Canada’s participation in the Liberation of Britain. While Dunning’s position appears secure, most Liberals doubt they can pull off a repeat of their 1935 victory with Dunning at the helm."

The fall of the British Isles to Syndicalism was enough to make the King, who had previously considered himself a reformer, consider abdicating the Throne. While the King ultimately decided against it, refusing to abandon his subjects in their darkest hour, the King withdrew from public affairs, pushing for compromise with several concessive governments to ‘keep the peace’. With the King withdrawing, his son, Prince Edward, has taken up many of the King’s duties, establishing himself as a charming and likeable public figure which both Francophones and Anglophones can feel pride in. Despite this, Edward has shown himself to be much more uncompromising in the realm of Political Affairs, and many predict that Edward will come to clash with the Liberal Government once his father eventually comes to pass. Regardless of political matters, the King has shown himself to be dutiful, stoic, and unyielding in the face of Syndicalist Tyranny. Edward, despite being the first British King who will not be crowned as King in the halls of London’s Westminster Abbey, is determined to be the last."

canada.4.t:0 "Death of King George V"
canada.4.d:0 "Ever since the fall of his beloved Empire, King George V’s health has greatly declined. Invariably alternating between bouts of extreme senility and fierce lucidity, the King has abandoned most of his official duties, only rarely making public outings just to keep up appearances. His eldest son Edward has taken over his father’s spot in most official state functions, and has kept the gears of the Monarchy running as his father gradually became a shut-in. The last several months in particular have been difficult on the old King, with severe episodes of delirium becoming common. In these episodes, the King often experienced fierce hallucinations of being back in London as he drifted in and out of consciousness, describing in fevered pitches wild nightmares of being hunted by Syndicalist Demons, and feverish visions of personally vanquishing the Red Devils from London.\n\n While treatments for his illness have been attempted, it seems all was for naught. At 11.55 p.m. yesterday, the King died following a bout of severe fever. Official reports state that the King peacefully drifted to sleep, however the darker truth is that the King was injected with a lethal dose of cocaine, all so his death would be reported in the much more prestigious morning newspapers instead of less appropriate evening journal. The Royal Family, most notably his son Edward, were supportive of his euthanasia so his doctors may ‘end the King’s suffering’. Of course, not everyone buys that the King was put down to avoid undue suffering, to some, Edward’s motives are marked with much more sinister intentions. Edward disagreed with his father on many matters, most prominently his views that the most sacred institutions of British Liberal Democracy are secondary in the quest to retake the British Homeland. George fervently disagreed, stating that ‘if we can not safeguard our democratic institutions, we would be no better than the Syndicalists’, and furthermore stating ‘After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself within 12 months’. Edward, ever the vengeful and plodding man, could very well have had his father ‘put out of his misery’, allowing his father to die so the Empire may live.\n\n Regardless of his role in the King’s death, Prince Edward has inherited the throne as Edward VIII, and is expected to address the nation within the month. An official coronation will take place in several month's time, after an official mourning period for King George has been observed."

canada.81.t:0 "Fate of Exile Voting Rights"
canada.81.d:0 "Since the British Revolution drove them from their homes, the almost 5 million British Exiles which reside in Canadian Territory have had a complicated status within Canada society. Despite living in Canada and being immersed in Canadian society, these exiles are not classified as Canadian citizens, but rather as citizens of the United Kingdom who happen to inhabit Canada temporarily; just until their homes can be restored. Of course, this status was afforded at a time when we all were sure that the Syndicalist uprising would be squashed before we could finish a cup of tea; however almost 20 years have passed since the British Revolution by this point, and many of the Exiles have grown uppity about their lack of official status within the Kingdom of Canada. Indeed, the Exiles can not vote, do not enjoy the same rights awarded to Canadian citizens, and are still classified as ‘foreign nationals’. While many politicians say that the Exiles more than make up for their lack of official citizenship with their wealth and status, the many blue-collar and working class exiles who fled to escape the Syndicalist ‘red terror’ have protested their inability to vote. Since they are not permitted to vote in Canadian elections, and since the British Government in Exile holds no elections currently, these lower class exiles are left without a voice, and are thus powerless in governmental affairs. Of course, allowing the Exiles to directly participate in Canadian Elections would surely tilt the balance of power in favour of the Conservatives due to the aristocratic nature of the Exiles, something we can not allow; but perhaps a middle ground could be met by allowing Exiles to vote in their own independent elections. While legal experts question much of a legal mandate a government elected entirely on foreign shores would enjoy, holding elections within the Exile community would surely be a small pyrrhic victory, and show the Syndicalist Autocrats our true commitment to parliamentary democracy. Of course, these elections would only serve to elect Britain's Prime Minister in Exile, a mostly ceremonial post by this point."

Of course, voting trends among the Exile Community are influenced by Canadian politics, with many of the lower and middle class exiles coming to support the Liberals or the CCF, and their equivalents in Exile politics, the Liberals and Labour.

To many it was MacDonald who worked so tirelessly to prevent Britain to succumbing to the same fate as France, ultimately failing in his mission due to Conservative and Liberal sabotage, in the eyes of others, it was MacDonald’s reckless cooperation with radicals that landed the Syndicalist revolution right on our doorstep. MacDonald has defended both his own and Labour’s performance in the years before the Revolution, pointing to how he attempted to root out radical Socialists within the party at every step, compromising across the aisle to help defend the interests of the British People. This action gained him the scorn of many within the party, ultimately leading to Labour splintering into two competing factions once the revolution arrived, with one faction fleeing into exile in Canada, and the other remaining as part of the new ‘Union of Britain’. Being one of the few Labourites not to stay behind in the new, Syndicalist Britain, MacDonald continued to command Labour from exile; eventually rebranding the party as the ‘National Labour’ party.\n\n MacDonald was greatly affected by death of King George V, a personal friend who considered him his favourite Prime Minister, with MacDonald paying tribute to him in his diary as "a gracious and kingly friend whom I have served with all my heart". MacDonald himself passed away on a sea voyage near Bermuda, recommending MacDonald to restore his health. His body was moved to Bermuda on the nearest available Royal Navy Cruiser, where his body lay in state until being transferred to Ottawa for a proper funeral. He is succeeded as leader of the National Labour party by his son Malcolm, who vows to follow in his fathers footsteps in fighting for the Working Man without bending to Syndicalist Tyranny."

canada.9.d:0 "In one of the many attempts to make the Exiles ‘more at home’, the Canadian Senate was replaced with the House of Lords. While the House of Lords holds much of the same function of the old Senate, the power to appoint Lords has lied solely in the King. This has led to the House of Lords being composed almost entirely of Exiles - who have been given these posts as rewards for 'valiant service to the defense of the Empire'. Many members of the government are saying the time has come to insist on [GetCANUpperHouse] Reform, passing a law restoring the Senate, and ensuring Senatorial appointments be confirmed by the House of Commons. Considering the [GetCANUpperHouse] has the power to reject bills, this could result in a showdown with the king... unless he decides that it is better not to anger the government of his host country while in exile."

The king's stance appears to be that 'in these troubling times' he cannot relinquish his royal prerogatives... so that likely means no reform will be possible.

canada.120.d:0 "With the Royal Navy constantly trying to find new ways to save resources, a new project to cut steel usage within naval construction has been proposed called Project Habakkuk, related to the abandoned American concept of Liberty Ships. Proposing the creation of new aircraft carriers largely made out of pykrete - a steel-replacement largely made out of wood pulp and ice that is effectively bulle-proof and fire-proof - Project Habakkuk is a strange plan based on the designs and theories of Geoffrey Pyke, J. D. Bernal, A. Gerke, Leopold Amery, and Lord Mountbatten, and is partially based on American designs sourced from Project Plough and the production specs for the M29 Weasels. Though these ships of wood and ice have been treated as a joke by members of the admiralty like Nevil Shute, initial tests of the first ship of their type - the HMS Habakkuk - confirm the efficacy of their flotation ability and ballistics resistance. Whether these new Royalty Ships sink or float, however, remains to be seen."

canada.122.t:0 "Project Habakkuk Fails"
canada.122.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, Project Habakkuk has proven to be an absolute failure. Research and rigorous testing has shown that despite their capability of stable flotation and their ballistics resistance, the pykrete design of the ships fail in warmer waters, with the tropical waters of the equator causing the pykrete hulls to melt and fail, showing that pykrete can only work in cold waters. It would seem that we will have to look for new ship designs elsewhere, for pykrete seems to be an expensive dead end."

Despite this, King [CAN_king_first_name] and Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] have all but anointed J.F.C.

This setback is difficult to take, as any potential solution to the economic crisis would require a majority in parliament; something which the Liberals do not possess.

The Prime Minister has asked for a renewed mandate from the King, and has followed through by dissolving Parliament and announcing a general election scheduled to be held in October of this year. Rumour in private is that instead of calling for an election, the King planned to directly appoint Bennett as Prime Minister, however was dissuaded from using his reserve power. While the King is known to meddle in political affairs, he realizes that such an act would only vilify the Exiles in the minds of Canadians, and provide a substantial boon to Liberal popularity.\n\n Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have already begun campaigning, and the general sentiment is that this election will be an important one - does the country push hard towards a confrontation with the Union of Britain, or does it take a more cautious approach and focus on building up Canada's strength and that of the other Dominions? The Liberals favor the latter, while the Conservatives and the British Exiles heavily favor the former."

Black Monday provided the perfect storm of conditions to force the Prime Minister out, and on advice from the new King, Dunning has officially announced his resignation as Prime Minister and as leader of the Liberal Party. His retirement, officially announced as being due to bad health, has returned William Lyon Mackenzie King, Dunning’s predecessor who lost party leadership after substantial Liberal losses in the 1926 election to power. Mackenzie King, despite lacking charisma, is much more favourable to the Canadian public than Dunning, as well as with the Exiles, who see him as the “Liberationist Liberal” candidate. King’s succession as leader is expected to be followed by a General Election, as the Liberals feel confident that they can secure a sizable majority without Dunning’s unpopularity dragging the party down."

Canada, he says, should be pushing hard for the coming war, and suggests that if it fails to do so 'the Entente shall be caught once again in a weak and indefensible position'. Considering the large crowd he attracted at his latest speech in Halifax, there are a large number of Canadians who agree with him."

Coldwell, and Reverend Tommy Douglas, have been making large gains in the polls as Woodsworth speaks to groups of unemployed labourers, down-on-their-luck farmers, and impoverished and 'oppressed' factory workers across the country. The party's social democratic platform has resulted in accusations of it being funded and run by syndicalist sympathizers despite there being little to no evidence of this fact aside from baseless speculation concerning the CCF’s recent influx of exiles coming from the famously anti-Syndicalist British Labour party, but its message of alleviating the suffering of farmers and workers under capitalism has hit a chord even so. Regardless, its popularity seems most concentrated in Western Canada, and the idea that it might have a chance at forming a government is remote unless it is able to foster good relations with the Liberal Party over their shared appreciation of welfare economics and social justice so that a coalition may be formed. However, such a prospect seemingly becomes more possible by the day, which has frightened the Conservatives and their influx of exiled Tories, and has terrified the more radical monarchist and nationalist movements farther along the Right. As such, Canadian democracy gets more and more turbulent by the day."

Whether Bill C-7 includes conscription, however, is the key element. French-Canadians in Québec are, in particular, vehemently opposed to the idea of general conscription forcing them to fight in a 'British war', and thus Liberal promises of not implementing it have seen them make great gains in that province. Conservatives, meanwhile, say that Canada doesn't have the manpower to fight any war without conscription.

Calling their new group the Imperial Unity Party, Arcand and his ilk advocate for the creation of a reborn Canadian state, supported by Corporatist economics and the Social Credit movement, and uplifted by a newly-awakened national consciousness backed by patriotic fervor, rampant militarism, and the undying loyalty of the masses. Though the party initially failed to take root due to lack of support and funding as their rivals in the Absolutists jockeyed with them for members, the IUP has seen a recent uptick in membership and national popularity, curiously due to incoming funding and support from certain shady groups like the reactionary, ultra-royalist, anti-democratic group of esoteric neo-feudalists known as the English Mistery and the infamous and enigmatic clique of famed commander J.

canada.53.d:0 "The British Revolution has made clear the shortcomings of the post-war British Military. When the revolution succeeded in Britain, it forced Canada to become the senior member of the Empire. While Canada was able to seize the West Indies, we were unable to secure the rest of the Empire and had to rely on the Australasians to secure a perimeter around their territory. Many regard this as a result of our small army at that time, and many would like to resurrect the conscription bill to swell our ranks. The Conservative government has avowed that it intends to employ extensive conscription across the country. There are those in the party, however, who have expressed grave concern over the reaction from French Canadians, and have suggested that a more limited form of conscription - while still objectionable to the French - would at least not stir up violence and might actually get some support from the Liberals on the bill. There are those within the Liberal party who agree with the Conservatives in that Canada's manpower reserves are already dismally low. While it is true that the Empire needs soldiers to defend it, it is impossible to deny that morale is paramount to maintaining a successful army, and that an army of demoralised and resentful conscripts would barely be able to properly wield a rifle, let alone win a prolonged war. A possible solution to this issue is mandatory enrolment of all young citizens in reserve training programmes for two years after secondary school. This proposal, while popular with those who want to maintain an army of quality over quantity, has drawn the ire of some Liberals who have declared that this is too much, stating that it is simply conscription by another name. With the nation vulnerable, the Americans and Unionists threatening the peace, and the Royal Navy decimated and split between the Dominions, it has become clear that we need some sort of way to get men to enlist and protect Canada. To that end, the Conservatives have proposed using additional funds to improve conditions within the army.

canada.56.d:0 "When the Weltrkieg began, the British Prime Minister Herbert Asquith said that industry would proceed as 'Business as Usual'. The ensuing shell crisis and the difficulty found in equipping the British army have shown us that if another war were to start, we will need a mobilised war economy. Recovery from the Great Depression has left Canada's industry in a deplorable state, and the government insists that the nation needs to industrialise at an incredibly rapid rate if it hopes to challenge the Union of Britain's power. However, most businessmen aren't willing to invest in specialised facilities such as Heavy Bomber factories that such an economy would require. Some within the King’s Privy Council are proposing that part of the Security bill include a provision to immediately nationalise such key war industries. While this wouldn't increase the size of our industrial capacity, it would cut down on a lot of red tape. Others have put forward proposals to provide significant incentives for business, and in exchange the Crown would hold the ability to direct which goods are manufactured. Some Tories and Liberals are united in the assumption that government regulations got us into this mess in the first place, and that the best course of action is to protect the Free Market. C.D. Howe, the minister of munitions, argues that the government subsidise the creation of such industries that entrepreneurs would lease at very preferable rates and provide the labour which would increase the number of factories, but limit their efficiency by working with the private sector. Some MP's are arguing for a compromise where the government will nationalise the specialised industries that require a great deal of sophistication while subsidising the more basic ones already in place. Of course, MPs representing the Social Credit Party of Canada and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation are unhappy with all options, and say that the Government should focus on supporting Canada’s poor and downtrodden instead of preparing to fight far-off conflicts."

canada.57.d:0 "Canada has been able to avoid the bitter class war that engulfed Britain after the Weltkrieg, but conflict between Anglo-Canadians and British exiles is growing, as has syndicalist sentiment among Canada's labour unions. While we are removed from the epicentre of Syndicalist aggression, waves of leftist agitation occasionally reach our shores, as do ideals that even the CCF would call too radical.  Some of this has led to the development of several groups calling for rapprochement with the Union of Britain, and for the abolition of the Monarchy and the institution of a Canadian Republic. The Mounties, long serving as stalwart defenders of Canadian Freedom, have now been entrusted to keep Canada safe from Syndicalist Radicalism. At times this has led many to lob mud and make accusations that they are nothing more than the King’s secret police. While they are clearly nothing of the sort, some clearly wish that they were as effective at crushing socialists as their detractors claim, or at the very least that they were an agency which could effectively oversee counterintelligence operations. The Tories want to crack down on radical groups and have proposed that a new parliamentary committee be formed with executive power over the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a new civilian intelligence agency be created with Conservative M.P. Robert Manion as its Chairman. Such a committee would be the first of its kind in Canada and would cut back on many civil liberties and union rights. Ernest Lapointe, the Solicitor-General, has suggested that some symbolic laws be passed to bring some of the Tories on side and that a weaker committee be created with Louis St. Laurent as its chairman, while the Progressives are adamant that no infringement of their civil rights take place. Other Liberals, meanwhile, have stated that Ernest Lapointe himself would do a better job overseeing the RCMP, or that the Prime Minister alone should oversee such operations. Lapointe is far more moderate in his views, and as an MP from Québec he is far more in tune with French Canadians, which would be a boon to the already fragile situation in Quebec. Of course, there are many who reject the idea that parliament should be involved in RCMP affairs, and instead propose that the RCMP be given new authority only if they promise to continue their commitment to upholding the peace and maintaining social order. Regardless of our choice, the issue is clear: Canada must re-organise and streamline its overly bureaucratic security forces."

The Prime Minister, ever enthralled with the beyond, has consulted with mediums and fortune tellers for advice on political matters; even trusting their judgment over that of his political peers. While typically not allowing his spiritual beliefs to influence the decisions of his government, some wonder if his intense spirituality may distort his understanding of the various Occult political movements that have popped up in Exile communities. These occult circles trend right, and often make inroads with the likes of the Arcand and J.F.C. Fuller: one of the most prominent proponents of esotericism and mysticism in the country.\n\n Mackenzie King often uses mediums to stay in contact with departed associates, particularly with his mother. Thereby, claiming to have communicated with Leonardo da Vinci, Wilfrid Laurier, Sir Arthur Currie, his dead mother, his grandfather, and several of his dead dogs, as well as the spirit of the late King George V. While these activities are typically kept out of the public’s prying eye, one would wonder the political ramifications if Mackenzie King’s strange beliefs became common knowledge. "

Nicknamed ‘Weird Willie’ in his occultist circles, he has begun to become known by this moniker nationwide as King and his cadre of mediums, magicians, wizards, and more hold public seances and rituals that prod at the walls of the spiritual immaterium - allegedly communing with Leonardo da Vinci, Wilfrid Laurier, his own dead mother and grandfather, several of his dead dogs, and the spirit of the late American President Theodore Roosevelt, among others, seeking portents of wisdom and guidance from the Spirit World on how to rule - while guiding the masses to spiritual enlightenment and evolution. Shocking many and defying tradition, Prime Minister King has even shown up to numerous sessions of Parliament in his ceremonial magician robes, all to much ado and much to the chagrin of many a stuffy Tory, while encouraging his ever-growing cadre of fellow Liberal warlocks and occultist ministers to do the same. Working with the members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn that fled Britain with the rest of the Exiles, and with Canadian Spiritualists and Spiritists, along with other similar groups like John Hargrave’s Kibbo Kift and the less reactionary members within J.F.C Fuller’s Thelemite clique, King shall bring about a new occultist culture for Canada that chases the supernatural and charges towards mass epigenesis while keeping one foot steadily planted in democratic Liberalism."

canada.702.d:0 "A rather strange situation is brewing between Ontario Premier Mitchell Hepburn and Prime Minister Mackenzie King. Hepburn’s election as Premier was heralded by a bizarre coalition of Liberals, Labourites, and Communists; however once in power, Hepburn refused to let the Congress of Industrial Unions operate in Ontario. This resulted in a CIO-backed General Strike in an Oshawa General Motors plant which was put down personally by Hepburn and a volunteer police force after Prime Minister King refused to send in the RCMP. The crack police squad assembled by the Premier has been derisively referred to as "Hepburn's Hussars" or the "Sons of Mitches". Mackenzie King’s response to the strike has struck a bitter wedge between the two men, which has manifested in hostile actions ever since. Hepburn has since lent support to the Tories, and has bitterly accused King of mismanaging the war effort. Hepburn stands out from most Liberals by enthusiastically supporting conscription, and believes that King isn’t doing enough to support Canada’s war effort. This aggravating divide between the two men serves to fuel more division between the Federal and Provincial Liberals,  and jeopardizes our already fragile wartime government."

There are, however, several within the Liberal Caucus that vocally support the rights of workers to unionize, none more than the Honourable Humphrey Mitchell. Mitchell has previously been active with the Union movement in his home city of Hamilton Ontario, and has been considered for the position of Minister of Labour. Mitchell has always championed working-class causes, and despite hostility with the group of independent Labour MPs known as the ‘Ginger Group’, he would attend the founding conference of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. One of the most outspokenly pro-union members of the Liberal Party, Mitchell has advised PM King to officially support the right of non-radical unions and put forward legislation to protect the rights of workers to unionize. Conservatives in parliament have argued that such actions would ‘Open the door to Syndicalism’, and have demanded that the bill requires that all the main Unions within Canada would have to officially disavow Syndicalism to be considered legal. This stipulation, while reasonable, would certainly anger more radical groups such as the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada and the ‘One Big Union’ group. "

In his own words, Diefenbaker states ’My creed as a Canadian is summed up in these words - I am a Canadian, a free Canadian, free to speak without fear, free to worship God in my own way, free to stand for what I think right, free to oppose what I believe wrong, or free to choose those who shall govern my country. This heritage of freedom I pledge to uphold for myself and all mankind, for I am a Canadian.’ \n\nThough these words have put off more liberal and progressive elements at the fringe of Canadian politics within groups like the [GetCCFName] and even among some Exiles that despise the idea of an independent and distinct Canada, the message of ‘I am a Canadian’ has begun to resonate with much of the nation’s older populace and conservative citizens.

Further accused of being a litany of ludicrous things from being a supposed German puppet sent to dismantle the Entente from within to even being a ‘crypto-Savinkovite’ - whatever that’s supposed to mean - Diefenbaker has withstood these attempts to deplatform him and the Progressive Conservative party as he keeps a stiff upper lip and pushes on towards true Canadian prosperity and sovereignty, while urging the rational and sane among the Canadian population to ignore these fanciful and moronic lies."

canada.767.d:0 "Sweeping across Canada starting in the late 19th Century, the Social Gospel movement has been popular across the nation for years, but it most notably took hold in Saskatchewan where our own [GetCCFName] has its roots. Founded nebulously around the 1880’s, the Social Gospel movement finds its roots in ‘Progress and Poverty’ by American Leftist economist Henry George, and has been linked to the single-tax movement and wider Georgism for years since the term Social Gospel was first used by famous American preacher Charles Oliver Brown. However, its foundations as a theologically-based movement is thanks to American clergyman Washington Gladden, the Settlement Movement of Jane Addams, the theology of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion church of New York City, and the writings of Walter Rauschenbusch, who wrote ‘A Theology for the Social Gospel’, released in 1917 in response to the Great War and which organized the views of the varied movement. \n\nNow pioneered in Canada by Thomas ‘Tommy’ Clement Douglas - a renowned and widely-beloved Baptist minister turned [GetCCFName] politician and one of the first [GetCCFName] members ever elected to Parliament - after he began to dive into the movement during his time in college, the Social Gospel theo-ideology calls for progressive social reform paired with and influenced by Protestant social teaching. Applying Christian ethics to the social problems and societal ills that afflict Canada, such as economic inequality, poverty, addiction and alcoholism, crime, rising racial tensions, the build-up of slums, environmental degradation, unsanitary living environments, child labor, a lack of unionization, educational maladies and poor schooling, and war to name a few, while also backing ideas like single-tax Georgism, adherents of this Social Gospel wish to spread these ideas in order to achieve true social justice in Canada as a whole. \n\nKeeping in mind that most of the CCF’s members already openly follow this movement, with prominent figures such as J. S. Woodsworth, M. J. Coldwell, and many other party leaders preaching these wise words alongside the Right Honourable Tommy Douglas, many have suggested that we begin to put the ideas of Social Gospel into legislation. However, others argue that this would encroach on the Canadian ideal of secular democracy as these Protestant-based ideas take hold. Though the members of the Social Gospel movement have no desire to infringe upon the sacred freedom of religion, this still has been a concern, or at least talking-point, against the notion by many of the CCF’s enemies. What shall we decide?"

The rest of the Exiles look on nervously, hoping King can guide Canada to a brighter future and the Exiles to British shores. "

canada.1141.t:0 "Liberal-CCF Coalition in Canada"
canada.1141.d:0 "The Liberals, hoping to score a majority in Canada’s 1936, were instead faced with yet another Minority Government once the polls closed. Despite this setback, the Liberals have managed to secure a mandate by allying with the left-wing Cooperative Commonwealth Federation. While some accuse this group of Socialist, leanings, the party maintains that its a keynesian, social-democratic and agrarian group intent on protecting the interests of Canada’s farmers and workers. The King himself has not commented on this coalition, but has nonetheless congratulated Prime Minister Mackenzie King, who now presides over a shaky coalition. Whether this coalition will survive the tumult ahead remains to be seen, but if one thing is true, it’s that the once irrelevant CCF now holds a tremendous amount of leverage."

canada.1142.t:0 "Tories Elected in Canada"
canada.1142.d:0 "The Right-Wing and Exile Friendly Conservative Party of Canada has come out on top in Canada’s most recent elections. Unseating the Liberals after barely a year in power, this is seen as correcting the ‘wrongs’ of 1935, when the Liberals won a narrow majority and broke an almost 10 year Conservative winning streak. Now in power, the Conservatives have promised to strengthen relations with the King, and use harsh measures to suppress any would-be Syndicalists who wish to infiltrate Canada. While the Liberals and the CCF promise to protest their more Pro-Exile moves, the fact that they hold the majority of Parliament, as well as the backing of the [GetCANUpperHouse] and the King means that they will have little difficulty implementing their agenda."

canada.116.t:0 "The King Addresses the [GetCANUpperHouse]"
canada.116.d:0 "King [CAN_king_first_name] has spoken publicly for the first time since exercising the royal prerogative a week ago. In a raucous speech to the [GetCANUpperHouse], the King has declared that "in order to ensure security and continuing stability, the Kingdom of Canada will be reorganized into the second British Empire, for a safe and secure society". He went on to announce that the House of Commons will be suspended indefinitely, so the [GetCANUpperHouse], composed almost entirely of Exile loyalists appointed by the King, will hold all the real power in the country until the Isles are reclaimed. These comments seemed to have invigorated the Exile population and many are even considering retaking lost territories in the West in order to bolster the British cause toward securing the birthright. Predictably, the Canadian population has not taken well to this news and planned pro-democracy protests across the nation, most of which were quickly quashed by the Exile-aligned military."

After all, as government propaganda has stressed to the Québecois, the destruction of war could come to the province if the nation is unable to properly defend itself. Despite this, there is still a sizable anti-conscription contingent causing unrest across the province. Throughout the province, muted demonstrations have broken out, with signs carried that either call for Québec separation from Canada or death to the 'English king'. While the RCMP has been able to easily restore order so far, it is not without a few of the demonstrations having turned violent."

In return, we would join the Entente and enjoy their protection... and provide them with a means to launch an invasion of [ENG.GetNameDef]. While this solves several of our issues, it also means involving ourselves in a war we have no real stake in."

We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."
canada.200.d.assass:0 "The government is becoming alarmed at the rapidly-developing crisis in the United States. While the assassination of Bill Haywood has meant the Socialist Party of America was unable to gather the will to rise up - a fact for which the Canadian government is extremely grateful - it still seems unthinkable that the American government would go to such lengths, and makes many wonder if Huey Long's accusations of corruption and tyranny are true. Even if they are, should we involve ourselves? The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out.

We cannot be expected to fight wars elsewhere with a syndicalist government sitting directly to the south, can we? For now, support merely means directing the Entente to send volunteers and equipment, but - if we pick a side - some suggest our getting drawn into the conflict will become inevitable."

We cannot prevent it from happening, but some believe it might be possible to delay. If we were to quietly contact and fund Canadian labour movements, get them to rise up in strikes that have obvious syndicalist connections, the Canadians might be too paranoid to take action until the strikes are shut down.

As the guns fall silent, peace, fragile perhaps, but peace nonetheless, has returned to America. While many within our government, now slowly creeping its way out of the South into the rest of the nation, would like to claim that we alone brought this peace, it would be a flat out lie. Canada, and the rest of the Entente, has played more than a small part in helping to restore order and unity. Canadian help of course, did not come without price. When they first reached out to us, we promised that we would hand over the Red Belt, in exchange for their aid. With the war now over, the government in Ottawa has formally requested that we make good on our promise. However, many within the government of [root.getleader] are whispering that we could easily go back on our deal. After all, we now have the full might of America behind us, no longer are we the cornered dog that Canada had seen fit to offer help too. Thus, we should stand up, and not willingly surrender our land. Of course, by doing this practically ensures that the Entente would never entertain us again, and a paranoid few fear that Canada would surely invade us in our weakened state to get what they claim is theirs by right. With the nationalists in Canada not being ones to be kept waiting, we had best send a response soon, lest we invoke their wrath for answering tardily."

Changing their minds on our most generous offer to take the Red Belt off their hands for helping them win, they have flatly refused. Citing that the deal was made under duress, they instead offered up a lump sum, roughly 10 million dollars, along with canceling the debt incurred by the United Kingdom during the Great War. By doing this, they hope to maintain their national sovereignty, while remaining in the good graces of the Entente. While the canceling of the debt would not be nothing, it is nothing next to the riches that we could have gained by directly controlling America's industrial heartland. Due to this, many within the government have called for the head of [COR.getleader], calling for the armed forces to march into America. and burn what little remains to the ground. While America is greatly weakened, it would still be a hard fight, thus many are calling on us to swallow our pride, and take their tiny, miniscule offer instead.

In a short speech, President [COR.getleader] said that a new day was dawning for Canada and America alike. What wasn't said, was just how bad the lands of the Red Belt have become. Hundreds of Syndicalist militaman remain among the ruins, still fighting for their dead revolution. It is even said that the monster Haywood himself remains, fighting with his men, despite claims that the intrepid leader of the Second American Revolution fled to the Commune of France. While the rebels are bad enough, the land is a decaying husk of its former self. While factories still turn out weapons and supplies, they are badly damaged, and most major cities have been reduced to smoldering craters. Rebuilding will take much time, and even if the Red Belt is rebuilt, the amount of resources that will be needed to truly integrate the region are incalculable. Regardless, the Constitutionalists have been true to their word, and even if it takes a lifetime, the Red Belt shall become an integral part of the State."

The Governor has stated that if Canada does not take hold of its rightful territory within two weeks, the State Legislature will refuse to rescind this act, rebuking the legitimacy of the treaty and recognizing the Canadian sector of the Disputed Zone in Quebec and New Brunswick as part of the State of Maine. Barrows accordingly has threatened the Prime Minister, stating that he intends to send the Maine National Guard into the disputed zone unless Canada recognizes the redrawn borders.\n\n This altercation has puzzled the Prime Minister, who made a phone call to Governor Barrows to query into the source of this unusual episode. Barrows confessed that their decision was meant to provoke Canada into saving the citizens of the disputed zone from the chaos and lawlessness that has engulfed the State since the outbreak of the Civil War. Prime Minister [CAN_pm_name], rattled by the call, has suggested that Canadian forces could move into Maine and restore order if it is what the majority of the State’s populace wants, and has stated that the Maine National Guard may invade Canadian territory if we refuse.

Since the Civil War broke out, the entire region of New England; almost completely cut off from the rest of America, has broken into virtually complete lawlessness. With the majority of soldiers and Law Enforcement being posted to the frontline, social order has suffered accordingly. Maine in particular has been faced with social hardship as a result, with the Maine Klan embarking on an all encompassing terrorist campaign in an attempt unseat Governor Barrows and install a Governor friendly to the Constitutionalist Government in Atlanta.\n\n The prospect of Canada moving into New England is nothing new, with the idea being floated previously as the ‘Derby Line Protocol.' While the protocol was never put into effect due to the Canadian government not wanting to anger Washington, it seems that a smaller scale version of this plan has now been put into place in Maine. The other New England Governors, while Canadian desiring intervention, quietly congratulated Maine on escaping the hellscape that is America in the Civil War. "

The Liberals have promised to cut all remaining ties with the United Kingdom and declare Canada as an independent Republic, something which the Monarchy has begrudgingly allowed.

The abolition of the Kingdom of Canada is certainly an option, even if some others would prefer to see another British Royal take up the post of King of Canada, allowing Canada to keep its own independent monarchy. If the time is truly up for the Kingdom of Canada, it would be a logical step for Canada to return to Dominion Status, replacing the position of King of Canada with the old post of Governor General. While the restoration of the Dominion would be a logical choice, many within the government feel that Canada has no such need for a Governor-General, and that if Canada isn’t commanded by the King then it must be commanded solely by Canadians.

The most notable one is the so-called ‘Pearson Pennant’, designed by artist and heraldic advisor Alan Beddoe, which has been favoured by up and coming member of the Liberal Party Lester B. Pearson. The flag is a "sea to sea" flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field; a design which has been derided by the media and viewed as a "concession to Québec". The other considered design was put forward by George Stanley, and is a red and white flag that features a single maple leaf.

canada.3037.d_republic:0 "With the decision to declare a Canadian Republic, a new Canadian flag separate from Britain is needed. While the 'Pearson Pennant' has been used as a temporary design, a committee to design a permanent Canadian flag has been assembled by the Prime Minister. The committee has come up with several designs, many of which have been ultimately discarded; however the committee ultimately favoured 2 main designs. The most notable one is Canada's current temporary flag designed by artist and heraldic advisor Alan Beddoe, which has been favoured by up and coming member of the Liberal Party Lester B. Pearson. The flag is a "sea to sea" flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field; a design which has been derided by the media and viewed as a "concession to Québec". The other considered design was put forward by George Stanley, and is a red and white flag that features a single maple leaf.

It is commonly agreed that the Kingdom of Canada will be phased out as the Governor-General is restored as the King’s representative in Ottawa; with the Kingdom gone, the question of what will replace it has arisen. The concept of the ‘Kingdom of Canada’ is nothing new, with our first Prime Minister John A. MacDonald himself suggesting the name before ‘Dominion of Canada’ was eventually settled on; ultimately chosen to avoid antagonizing the increasingly anti-Imperialist United States, which was a much more significant threat than the ruined former United States is today. Restoring the Dominion is seen as a symbolic move to show that Canada has moved on from the period of Exile. In a similar vein, many have suggested adopting the name ‘Commonwealth of Canada’ to show that Canada is a truly self-governing nation, separate from the United Kingdom and in charge of its own affairs."

canada.3039.d:0 "With the United Kingdom restored, a shocking decision has been made; the decision to found a separate Canadian Monarchy instead of restoring the prewar Governor-General. The King’s brother, Prince Albert, has officially been crowned as King of Canada in an elaborate ceremony in Ottawa which has been attended by hundreds of thousands. Albert is very popular with his Canadian peers, and has stated previously that he had already planned to remain in Canada before the decision to crown him as King was made. This decision has been motivated by the feeling that Canada deserves far more than a simple Governor-General now that Britain has been restored, and a fitting reward would be to send a Senior Royal to succeed the King. While technically just a rebranded version of the existing ‘Kingdom of Canada’, Albert is expected to add his own flair to the Canadian Monarchy as the British Monarchy and Canadian Monarchy evolve as separate institutions. Already a custom-made Canadian Crown, fitted with Fleur-de-lis and Maple-Leafs has been crafted out of Canadian gold and adorned with Canadian Gems, and a unique Canadian throne is already being designed. While the King of Canada is still a Windsor and a Brit, it is clear that Canada has defined itself outside of the British Monarchy. "

In addition to his wartime controversies, McNaughton has also made headlines for repeatedly clashing with the British Government. Holding himself to a specific Scottish-Canadian identity, McNaughton has expressed a unique form of Canadian nationalism based on his feeling that the British Empire was dominated by the English while Canada was dominated by Scottish-Canadians like himself.

True or not, the French Canadians are adamant that their continued place in Canada depends on the referendum passing.

Newfoundland’s situation was designed to be ‘temporary’ until the Home Isles were reclaimed; and now that the King has returned to London, Newfoundland’s status is once more in the air. Newfoundland is not a Province of Canada, and has had a separate status as a ‘Commision Government’, which has been in place ever since the Black Monday fiasco. Newfoundland’s democracy has been suspended since 1936, and while the calls for a return to ‘Responsible Government’ have been quiet during the war, perhaps it's worth re-examining Newfoundland’s situation now that Britain is free. Many within Newfoundland wish to see St. Johns return to the governance of London, just as was promised when Newfoundland was annexed. Others wish to see Newfoundland forge its own future separate from the United Kingdom and Canada, declaring Newfoundland as its own independent Republic. Others wish to see Newfoundland formally incorporated as a Province of Canada, officializing the de-facto status Newfoundland has held since the British Revolution. While politicians in Ottawa would be happy to make that decision for Newfoundlanders, some have proposed allowing the people of Newfoundland to decide upon their own fate. With the Commission Government being phased out, a new Election would allow the people of Newfoundland to decide on their own fates. "

However, the King is thinking that instead of giving all governance back to a native Icelandic government, we could perhaps install a monarch in Iceland in order to gain lawful control over the island for decades to come. The candidate to the created Icelandic throne would be Edward VIII’s cousin, Princess Alexandra, who would be crowned Queen of the island and given say over it’s affairs alongside a civilian Prime Minister.\n\nBut of course who is to say that the king must give the throne to anyone else but himself, and so if we decide the previous two options of natives and another member of the Windsors are unsatisfactory for leading Iceland, why not give King Edward the reins to do as he pleases?"

Aberhart has been reluctant to assume the position of Prime Minister, viewing it as abandonment of his Albertan constituents. If he were not to assume the position, Aberhart’s strong ally and de-facto second in command Ernest Manning would be a perfect choice for PM, one who Aberhart could easily control while still retaining his position as Premier of Alberta.

Despite Canada being on the losing end of the Weltkrieg, Currie still gained the position of General of the Armed Forces, and upon the fall of Britain to the revolution, rose to the rank of Chief of the General Staff. Currie was committed to extensive reform within the Canadian Army, transforming Canada’s military from a supporting element within the British Empire to a capable fighting force capable of standing toe-to-toe with Britain itself.\n\n While his legacy will not be lived on by a legacy of military heroics, Currie’s life will be defined by a history of faithful military service and competent military strategy which will be studied tirelessly in the years to come."

He believes that the current economic system was designed to create a plutocracy through unnecessary scarcity and that the workers needed to be freed from this system by bringing purchasing power in line with production. Douglas' reform programme contains two main elements, a national dividend to distribute money equally to all citizens to bridge the gap between earning power and prices, and a price adjustment mechanism that would forestall the possibility of inflation. Now that we are in power we can work to implement these ideas throughout the nation. However, critics have accused Social Credit of being 'syndicalist' and as such it would perhaps be wise to moderate our plans lest they draw anger."

Ernest Manning, while without a doubt a puppet of his mentor William Aberhart, has recently begun acting on political matters on his own. Manning has leaned towards more reformist veins of SocCred theory, even going so far as to suggest abandoning some of the party’s more radical ideas to appeal to voters in the rest of Canada. While undoubtedly a reformist in comparison to the ‘Dictatorial’ Aberhart, Manning still maintains his alliance with the King to maintain a monopoly on power and suppress organised labour, and is supportive of censoring dangerous Internationalist Media. With Canada growing resistant to the increasingly authoritarian hand of the SocCred, the question has been raised, what will be the extent to which we follow the Social Credit Creed?"

This idea, while not without its merit, has been the source of ridicule due to the faulty design of the certificates and the refusals of merchants to accept them as a form of payment. The program, while off to a promising start, clearly has many issues to iron out before it can be recognized as a successful nationwide program."

canada.4060.t:0 "A Crude Awakening"
canada.4060.d:0 "The situation revolving around resource acquisition, especially oil, in the Kingdom of Canada has always been troublesome. Ironically, since the arrival of the British exiles, the Turner Valley oil reserves have been notably declining for some time now. This is even with it supposedly being "the biggest oil field in the British Empire," although the site shows promising natural gas deposits. While that is still the case and further drilling is possible, it is still not a large field for future production standards. As a result, we have had to search for supplant oil and gas sources elsewhere. We have had limited success in other areas, such as in Edmonton, specifically near Leduc which has had some initial exploratory drilling occur. However, Prime Minister Manning, after looking into scientific discoveries revolving around our recent atomic research success, specifically our nuclear bombs, has proposed a nuclear detonation of the Athabasca oil sands. The oil sands consist of a mixture of crude bitumen, which is a semi-solid rock-like form of crude oil. Manning and a team of scientists have proposed that with the underground detonation of a nuclear bomb, the heat and pressure created by an underground detonation would boil the bitumen deposits. This process would turn bitumen deposits into liquid form, making them easier to access and extract. This extraction method could drastically reduce the cost and time associated with conventional extraction methods. Oil production in Canada would be revolutionized with direct drilling of this crude oil. This would allow the civilian sector to prosper and perhaps ensure oil production stability for future war efforts. Although there is concern over the number of nuclear bombs that will be required for these detonations, this can also advance our research in that field."

canada.4061.t:0 "Canada Dry?"
canada.4061.d:0 "While we most commonly associate prohibition with neighboring America, Canada has made several efforts to rid society of alcohol from the end of the 1800s to the 1920s. Most of these incidents occurred during the Weltkrieg, with provincial bans prohibiting alcohol sales accompanied by national prohibitions. Several provinces, however, have repealed such prohibitions due to dissatisfaction and widespread disregard. However, with the influx of British exiles, drunkenness, fighting, domestic abuse, and household impoverishment are on the rise again. This is due to both Canadians and exiles taking up the drink to drown their woes, both social and economic. As a result of these developments in society, temperance movements across the country have sprung up and become intensifiably popular. In this case, the Woman's Christian Temperance Union believes it is necessary to maintain social order by nationwide prohibition. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police must increase their presence at border crossings so that bootlegging can be strictly monitored, in order to discourage organized crime from tainting the country. This can also be achieved with harsher punishments for illegal trade or alcohol consumption. Additionally, the government should invest in preventative measures that focus on education and awareness. This will reduce the need for increased security and incarceration in the future. Despite the fact that this may be extremely unpopular and provoke harsh reactions from the populace, it will have a long-term benefit for the economy and society in the long run. Prohibition rumors have also increased sales of Canadian ginger ale soft drinks. However, it can supposedly mask the taste of harsh homemade liquors when mixed. Ultimately, a sober Canada will be capable of tackling any obstacle it may face in the future."

canada.4062.d:0 "Socreds have received sneers and jeers after William (Bible Bill) Aberhart's proposal of "social credit," which wealthy businessmen have decried as "funny money." Aberhart, coming to power in Alberta as its 7th Premier in 1935, promised to provide at least $25 a month to every Albertan over 21, and even supposedly claimed that he would pay a lesser amount to those under 21. Regardless, Aberhart's Socreds issued some "prosperity certificates" to try and offset the economic crises caused by the Great Depression afflicting the country currently. It was a bold attempt to revitalize Alberta's economy. However, the certificates were never issued to the public and instead were used to pay relief workers in Alberta. With Aberhart's ascendancy as Prime Minister, the first social credit campaign involving the entire country is underway. Despite its failure in Alberta, the idea of issuing prosperity certificates has been revitalized and is gaining traction in other provinces. With the rise in support, the Social Credit party is now in a better position to implement a nationwide scheme. However, banks have refuted the nationwide scheme, arguing that it would be too costly to implement, threatening to refuse any money provided by this program. They claim it has the potential to worsen Canada's economic crises and drive the country into disaster. The Social Credit party has responded by stating that the banks are denying the people their due money and have promised to pass laws that will force the banks to accept the certificates. Opposition parties have also joined the debate, opposing the idea. Despite the opposition, Aberhart is determined to push forward with the plan and believes it is the key to restoring Canada's economy."

canada.4063.d:0 "The Kindred of the Kibbo Kift, with Kibbo Kift being an old Cheshire-dialect phrase ‘Proof of Strength’, have some core beliefs that make them distinct among the Right-wing political groups of the Anglosphere. Believing all races, genders, sexes, and other identities to be equal and eligible for membership into the Kindred, they must stay fit and camp out for most of their time, help others anyway they can, learn how to make and produce things through handicraft and home-manufacturing skills, and to work with the Kindred to achieve world peace and utopian brotherhood of all man. Hargrave himself states that ‘a society of ugly people is an immoral society’, and this is exemplified in the Kindred’s advocacy of physical fitness, personal hygiene, mental health awareness, and even non-violent eugenics, for they seek to create a perfect and environmentally-conscious humanity through peaceful means. Adoptive families within the Kindred consist of a family roof-tree of a parent couple and their adopted or blood-born ‘cubs’ who group together to form clans, lodges, tribes, and other variously-named groups that can come together with other like-minded groups to form a Thing, of which the Kindred is composed of a growing number of which serve as the representative body of the whole Kibbo Kift, taking part in the yearly Althingamote around a large council fire to organize their shared society. \n\nThe group has also been accused of harboring pagan tendencies, but as a whole the group is largely undecided on any such matters but largely steer clear of any true pagan practice in favor of simple interest in druidic symbolism and identity. Instead, the claims come from attention drawn to Hargrave’s own fascination in magic and his own claims of being a druid, as well as the group’s tendency call each other by animal and plant-based names as they hold strange ceremonies in the woods with shrines built from natural debris and animal bones, wearing strange outfits based on medieval iconography or other more esoteric or ‘pagan’ designs complete with adjoining strange staffs, large swords and other weapons of a medieval knight, decorated scepters, and more. As a whole, the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift of the White Fox John Hargrave is a harmless albeit strange group within our coalition. However, their strange nature has become their ally, for they gain more and more members by the day, so it is probably best we keep an eye on them."

Rallying around the White Fox’s call of ‘We are the Green Shirts - indeed we are the Kindred - calling ourselves the Social Credit Party of Canada and the British Empire in Exile officially, but knowing full well who and what we are. Whelm on me ye Resurrected Men! I give you that Outcry of the Kin!’, the Kibbo Kift are among our greatest and most loyal allies. /n/nFamously, their mission was to further the belief that Kibbo Kift training would produce a core of healthy and creative individuals through whom the human race would evolve into a society without war, poverty and wasted lives. The Kibbo Kift held that individual character strengthened by mental discipline was the key to the future, not mass movements based on groups defined by class, race or nation states. However, many within our party do not fully agree with their wildly conservationist, environmentalist, scoutist, anti-modernist, and even semi-pagan ways due to Hargrave’s strange beliefs in natural magic, and as such, we must decide our official stance towards these Greens. We could allow them a great deal of power within the government, swinging Canada in a radically environmentalist and Green direction, or we could work to stymie their growing power.

Thus, if anyone within the Exiles had hoped that American aid could be used in the coming liberation, those dreams have been turned to ash, like so much of the American countryside. However, it does not have to be this way. In America's Deep South, the Constitutional American Republic fights for an America that shares many of the same ideals as ourselves. While outnumbered and seemingly outgunned, the Constitutionalists could make a very powerful ally should they prove victorious. Due to the nature of the Constitutionalist system, their enemies are many and international backers few, thus making them one of the weaker players in the Civil War. With us sharing much of the same basic ideological worldview, us supporting them comes as no surprise. Many within our coalition have begun calling on the government to step up our support. Instead of just sitting and supporting them from the sidelines, these few want us to directly intervene in the civil war, to ensure a Constitutionalist victory. These same few have also called for us to occupy America's Red Belt, possibly directly annexing it, as the small cost for our aid in their victory. After all, the Constitutionalist government would be greatly indebted to us, and what better way to pay it back then by a small land grant?\n\nWhile gaining the American Red Belt would be a massive boon to us both in terms of population and resources, and it would be a good way to perfect our methods of de-syndicalization, there is no guarantee that the Americans would agree.

In other words, in exchange for directly getting involved and helping put down the traitorous scum, Canada wishes for us to cede almost a fourth of the entire country. While in most times, such an 'offer' would be thrown out without consideration, these are desperate times. While yes, such a ceding of land would be the largest America has ever given away, we are fighting an uphill battle. We are surrounded on all sides, and internal enemies are just as vicious as those on the frontlines. Due to this, many within [root.getleader]'s government are genuinely considering such a proposal. Direct Canadian aid would not only all but ensure our victory, but could bring it even quicker. Besides, do we really want to deal with the insidious Reds when we could pass that cross over the Canadians? More radical members of this same camp believe America may very well be better as a nation without the Red Belt. The Red Belt has long been a hive of miscegenation, leftism, and immigrants. By ejecting them, our work to purify America becomes that much easier. Another option, besides rejecting it off hand, would be to offer to simply join the Entente. While much less in the favor of the Canadians, it would give them what they want, American resources to aid in the liberation of Britain.

In addition to illegalizing all official ‘Socialist’ and ‘Syndicalist’ parties, the act has also banned most major ultra-nationalist organizations, including Adrien Arcand’s Imperial Unity Party, which has proved popular with many disgruntled exiles. While many exiles are furious with parliament for arresting Arcand, the Prime Minister has struck back, stating that their cavalier attitudes towards Canadian Democracy challenged the very foundation of our government, and risks putting Canada on the path to a repeat of the events that led to the loss of Britain."

canada.416.d:0 "Today, in a move long expected since His Majesty's making direct use of his vast royal prerogatives, [GetBritishExilePM] has been dismissed as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom's government-in-exile. While these days the post is only a symbolic office to offer a public face for the Exiles, the position of Prime Minister is one that still carries great weight. Indeed, while political they may have little to no power, as public face of the Exiles, their words and deeds are greatly followed by the media, and thus reflect onto the Canadian public, be them Exile or not. With [GetBritishExilePM] being no fan of His Most Gracious Majesty and his flexing of his prerogatives, it is a reasonable move that such a man be removed from such an influential position.\n\nAs for his replacement, His Majesty handpicked two possible replacements, namely William Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook and Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere. Both men are well known to the King, as both lead respectable media empires. Indeed, nearly a third of the news that is published in Canada and the wider Empire goes through one of the two men's companies. Both men are also fairly friendly with the government of the King, although it would not be an exaggeration to call the Viscount Rothermere a die-hard loyalist, with deep ties to the United Empire League. The Baron Beaverbrook, for his part, has an incredible mind for logistics, being known for bringing a vital and vibrant energy to any logistical problem he touches. Along with this, the Baron Beaverbrook is a native Canadian, being born in Ontario in 1879. Due to this, Aitken is seen by those close to King as a way to play to the Canadians that we are all in this together. Either way, by appointing one of these two men, the King ensures that not only with a man who knows how to play the media, but practically ensures the support of a media empire. With his choices being limited to two, His Majesty elects to... "

canada.417.t:0 "Prime Minister's Office Replaced"
canada.417.d:0 "As the Nationalist movement within Canada becomes more empowered and popular by the day, it was enviably that this popularity would spread among the exiled British population that dwells among us. Indeed, various exile nationalist organizations that are nominally tied to their Canadian counterparts have exploded in popularity, with an estimated 47% of the Exiles belonging to any one of these groups. With this being the case, and with His Majesty seeking to further entrench his allies, [GetBritishExilePM] has been formally dismissed as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom's government-in-exile. While these days the post is only a symbolic office to offer a public face for the Exiles, the position of Prime Minister is one that still carries great weight. Indeed, while political they may have little to no power, as public face of the Exiles, their words and deeds are greatly followed by the media, and thus reflect onto the Canadian public, be them Exile or not. With [GetBritishExilePM] being no fan of His Most Gracious Majesty and the rising Nationalists, it is a reasonable move that such a man be removed from such an influential position.\n\nWhom is exactly to replace the now dismissed the Prime Minister is something of a contentious topic within the King's court and the broader Nationalist movement. Even with this being the case, two figures have repeatedly been brought up as possible replacements, namely Anthony Ludovici and Major-General J. F. C. Fuller. Ludovici and Fuller both are influential and well known faces within the Nationalist movement, although of different sides. Ludovici, a philosopher by trade, is a devoted supporter and follower of English Mistery and its message of practical neo-Feudalism. By appointing such a learned man, English Mistery would deeply enter the public conscious, a move that in future could lead to an even further increase of the King's powers. General Fuller, already one of the top men within the Military, is seen as something of a unity candidate. Besides being a top man to prepare the Exiles for the Reclamation War, Fuller would bring a more modern Nationalist mindset to the Exiles, as opposed to the radical traditionalism of Ludovici. On a personal note, Fuller is an avid believer in magic and the occult, something very well could put his government at odds with the Church.\n\nWhile both men are great picks in their own right, there is indeed a third choice to replace the Prime Minister. That choice being to simply leave the office vacant. After all, was it not the government of a Prime Minister that led to the fall of Britain in the first place? While such a move would be a radical step towards absolutism, it is the right of His Majesty to do so. After all, who better to lead the British than the man who was reared from birth to lead them?"

canada.418.t:0 "An End to the Kingdom of Canada"
canada.418.d:0 "Today, in a joint statement from His Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council, the Canadian Prime Minister's Office and the British Prime Minister's Office, the dissolution of the British government-in-exile along with the dissolution of the Kingdom of Canada was announced in a solemn ceremony. To replace them, the governments of both Canada and the UK are to be merged into a single entity. From a legal viewpoint, this transforms Canada from a Kingdom housing the royal family and the exiled government, into the legitimate continuity of the United Kingdom. Indeed, the dissolution of the UK's government-in-exile signals that at least some of its rightful land has been reclaimed, and thus normal governance can return. To many, this is also the start of an Imperial Federation, long the dream of many within the Empire.\n\nWhile the process of actually merging the governments will take some time, the most pressing question is exactly who is rule the restored UK along with the King.\n\nFrom a strictly legal standpoint, [GetBritishExilePM] is the current Prime Minister, and even with the merging, is to remain at their post. However, many close to the King have proposed dismissing the Prime Minister and replacing them with Adrien Arcand, whom has dutifully served the King as Prime Minister of Canada up until this point. By appointing Arcand, these members of the King's court say that it would make the transition easier, as having one of their own leading the entire Empire would no doubt make the pill easier to swallow. A smaller section of this same group agrees on all points, save the man to lead. To them, having a Frenchman lead the Empire is paramount to treason. Instead, they propose John Ross Taylor, a proper Anglo-Canadian. Taylor, having many of the same ideals of Arcand, broke with him over the issue of race and is seen by many as a more moderate face in the Nationalist movement.\n\nWith the merging of the two states becoming more and more of a reality each passing hour, His Majesty must soon pick a man to lead this complex process."

Much time has passed from then, and while all know that the Prerogatives are here to stay, many wonder exactly how long that is. When he first made use of them, His Majesty made no declaration that such an act was only temporary, yet many Canadians are beginning to think that when Britain has been reclaimed, the Prerogatives shall be laid down, and Canada's democratic traditions may once again flourish. Due to this belief, many Canadians have accepted the status quo, however not all have. Many Canadians, mostly former members of parliament, have approached the King and have asked him to formally declare that, once Britain has been liberated, Canada shall return to normalcy. Interestingly enough, certain members of the Exiles, among them many within the so-called English Mistery, have called for the King to increase his use of the Prerogatives. In fact, this group has pressed the King to formalize dissolve Canada's government, reinstating direct British rule, which as King of the United Kingdom, an entity that nominally has authority over Canada, meaning that the King could dissolve Canada without issue. By doing this, His Highness could also be seen as implementing the first steps of an Imperial Federation, a goal that is considered to be the logical end point of the entire colonial project. With two radically different proposals, with heavy backing towards both, His Majesty has been put into a corner. A corner that shall either see an eventual return to normality, or the end of Canada itself.             "

canada.4190.d:0 "The dissolution of the Kingdom of Canada has radicalised many a wild Canuck who has been pushed off the edge by the loss of their homeland to Exile interests. These new Syndicalist and Socialist rebels which occasionally pop up in this cold and frozen land are typically dealt with quickly, with the exception of the few who manage to stick around. While the RCMP’s routing of Syndicalist spies typically focuses on disgruntled Canadians, incredibly, some Exiles themselves can get caught up in Syndicalist sympathiser rings. One shocking example is the high-ranking Exile and member of the Conservative Party: Stanley Baldwin, who has recently been arrested by the RCMP on the orders of the King. Baldwin, ever the sly fellow, was tipped off before the Mounties could get to him, and fled across the Atlantic before something could be done about him. His treason was uncovered by a heroic telephone operator, who intercepted chatter between Baldwin and a high-ranking member of the Unionist Government. This member of the UoB’s government was none other than Baldwin’s own son, Oliver Baldwin. Despite his blatant treason to the crown, Baldwin has still kept in touch with his son, and was caught on the phone blatantly slandering the noble King and his righteous suspension of Democratic Institutions. Baldwin’s escape to London has ruffled many feathers in London, with Baldwin only being saved from arrest due to the influence of his son. Baldwin, despite being a high-ranking Tory, has stated that he plans to renounce politics and live the rest of his life in quiet retirement."

One such mark of this is grand mansions; truly breathtaking manors have begun defining the Canadian countryside. These new residences have been modelled off of the stately homes of the old country, which have been sadly lost to the Syndicalists. While it is hoped that these residences can one day be reclaimed and inhabited by their rightful owners once more, these Canadian mansions will make due until the day of Reclamation can come. The abbeys of Old Britain, instead of being home to Barons and Earls, are home to the new aristocracy of the Union of Britain; Union Chiefs and Representatives, who have continued running these mansions in much the same way as their old Royalist inhabitants.  While a few manors have been reclaimed by the servants, it seems that the Union of Britain continues the peerage in much the same way as the United Kingdom."

canada.4192.d:0 "As His Majesty continues to make use of a royal prerogative that has not been flexed in such a manner for centuries, the circles around the King, his very advisors, generals and other influential people, have doubled their efforts to ingratiate themselves with him. Every group, no matter the size or content, knows that if they want to have any laws passed, regulations changed, they need to win the favor of the King, and their wishes could become reality. While such a situation has long been the case in politics, having all power in a single man has radically changed the landscape. His Most Gracious Majesty, of course, is not blind to this state of affairs. While not happy with the situation, due to the great influence that these figures who lobby the King-Emperor hold, he cannot simply wave his hand and be done with it, for to do so would surely spell a public relations nightmare. What the King can do however, is change the style of how this business is conducted.\n\nBy Royal Decree, His Royal Highness, [root.getleader] has formally established a so-called 'Royal Council of State.' In short, this new body gives a much more streamlined way for the process of petitioning the King, while also creating a way for the King to delegate authority in any matters to his most trusted advisors. In the spirit of the Round Table of the Legendary King Arthur, the King treats those appointed the Council as neigh equals, granting a respect that was hitherto unseen. The members of the Council themselves, the King's most trusted advisors, have also taken to the example of the Knights of the Round Table, serving the King to the best of their abilities. While far from a true Round Table, and the members of it far from true Knights, the Royal Council of State shall no doubt serve as both an example of cooperation with the Crown, but also show the reward for Loyalty."
canada.4192.d_2:0 "With His Majesty's sudden change after waking from a coma, many aspects of the nation have begun to change. Be it simple governmental aesthetics to the very way he carries himself, many public figures have committed how the King acts as if he is a character out of a book. According to some, King Edward has begun to act like the legendary King Arthour himself. Not helping this public image, was a recent decree which fundamentally altered the Royal Council of State, the newly minted government office which aimed to streamline petitions to the King. In the decree, the King took advantage of companions of the Council and the legendary Knights of the Round Table, and formally established it as a legal continuation of that ancient order. All members of the Council were sworn in as Knights, with each given a small fiefdom to rule over. What's more, the King ordered the creation of a Round Table, in which all business of the body was to be conducted.\n\nWhile perhaps not the most strange thing that the King has done since awaking from his coma, this rebirth of an order that may have never existed in the first place, is still something of a shock to a public that is only just starting to get used direct Royal rule. This, coupled by events such as the King allegedly naming General Fuller as his court wizard(or the 'heir of Merlin' as some papers put it) or the government plans to build a replica of Camelot as a new residence for His Majesty, is simply more fuel for the flames . While the King's new 'tendencies' may be scandalizing to his aides, knights, or more conservative Exiles, most in the general public find his attanics amusing. Besides, Arthour was by no means a bad Monarch, so why not let King Edward take inspiration from such a legendary King"

Regardless of her most recent point of origin, her influence over the varied sets of Ultranationalist groups within Canada has been noticed by some within the King’s circle.

Many prominent members of the IUP such as Adrien Arcand and J.F.C. Fuller have already been granted the same treatment. Those who have suggested we do the same with Ms. Orman stated that this would bolster our support within the oldest and weariest Exile groups who adhere to her strain of Ultranationalism.

While the ideas may indeed follow the Exiles' home, under current British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], only the old model of Capitalism will follow in the wake of the Liberation. That is, unless His Majesty acts. A growing number of Exiles have petitioned the King to dismiss [GetBritishExilePM], replacing him with C. H. Douglas, founder of the Social Credit movement, himself. While something of a radical move, due to the current crisis of Exile, the King can dismiss and appoint the Prime Minister as he wishes. Douglas, for his part, appears to be willing to serve in this capacity. Despite this, Douglas is far from a true politician, preferring to focus on economic matters. However, perhaps this is just the kind of person Britain needs to lead it, for was it not 'true' politicians that got us into this mess in the first place? While many share the view that a true SocCred should lead Britain in Exile, Douglas’ inexperience in political matters may lead to trouble. To remedy this, many have suggested making way for the popular poet Ezra Loomis Pound to take up the spot; while he is an American Expatriate, his popularity with the movement may help us come time for the Liberation.

Furthermore, they suggest someone loyal to the party and fanatically loyal to our cause, but also not crucial to our own government and needs here in Canada. As such, they suggest the eclectic environmentalist, Social Credit fanatic, and druidic scout John Gordon Hargrave - noted as a British Far-Right personality and as the founding figure and so-called Head Man and White Rabbit of his outdoorsman and handicraft group the Kindred of the Kibbo Kift. \n\nAfter serving as a medic in the Great War for the British Empire, and after witnessing the British Empire not only lose the war, but then collapse a few years later in the fires of foul Socialist revolution, Hargrave became a devoted pacifist and Utopian thinker, further dabbling in both the natural sciences and a variety of witchcrafts and magics. Despite these oddities, Hargrave has long been attributed to the Social Credit movement, helping to bring fame and recognition to our party as a loyal adherent and party member for years, and notable friend of many within the government. A pioneering expert on Woodcraft, a veteran scout leader and trained combat medic, a devoted druidic pacifist, and ‘an author, cartoonist, inventor, lexicographer, artist, and psychic healer’ as stated in his own words, Hargrave is a divisive and esoteric figure with a legion of fanatical young men zealously loyal to his ideas and strange way of life, but he may be the perfect man to lead Britain under our wing, if we can control him."

Regardless, Hargrave holds onto his beliefs in the face of such sheer resistance, and still champions his pacifistic idea of uniting the British Empire and Anglosphere through peaceful and diplomatic means in line with the beliefs pushed by his Kindred. Though this bloodless ideal dreamed up by the White Fox is likely unattainable, perhaps his idea of pursuing the Imperial Federation and wider unity throughout the Empire can still be achieved in our reborn and newly strengthened Canada. Should Hargrave work towards his unpopular dream of Imperial unity in a less restrictive fashion as pushed by the Absolutists and the IUP, bringing about the dissolution of Canada as an independent entity and having it absorbed into the united and cohesive United Kingdom in Exile, or should we push on with the rest of the SocCreds for Canada alone, ensuring SocCred party unity and that all resources go towards our far more attainable goal of building a Social Credit-backed, Kibbo Kift-dominated paradise here in the True North?"

canada.429.d:0 "Famed, or infamous, zoologist and anthropologist George Percival Mudge has long been a member of the English Mistery and was a founding member of our IUP. Notable are his contributions to the Encyclopedia Britannica, writing about the genetic science behind albinism, the general study ontogeny, and incubation, and more generally about wider zoology. However, far more infamous, and far more useful to the Imperial Unity Party, is his work ‘The Menace to the English Race and its Traditions of Present-day Immigration and Emigration’, along with his publicly unpublished, but circulated privately within the party, works on eugenics and racial science. In these works, Dr. Mudge talked at length about the barbaric apelings and lesser races that assaulted Canada and the wider British Empire, sullying the Anglo-Saxon race with their degenerative cultures and genetics. Furthermore, Mudge theorized that by using selective breeding techniques, a perfect line, or set of lines, of blue-blooded nobles could be bred, putting the British race’s aristocratic and elitist element on the path to genetic perfection. Additionally, he also theorized that the same practices could be implemented on the inverse to the peasantry, creating a perfect stock of serfs to work as laborers and subjects in the English Mistery’s dream of a revived feudal society. Though Dr. Mudge has tragically passed away recently, his work still lives on, and now it is up to us to see that his life’s work is brought to fruition. We shall begin toying with his ideas on eugenics in secret, for the world cannot watch and meddle as we create a genetically-perfect aristocracy free from the immigrating masses of lesser apelings that assault the Anglo-Saxon civilization and bloodline."

With ideas like British Israelism, Christian Fundamentalism, Spiritualism, and more taking root across the True North among Exiles and Canadian nationals alike, Canada has begun to become a true breeding ground of strange, new Far-Right ideas. One such titan of this new rise of reactionary esotericism is Major-General John Frederick Charles ‘Boney’ Fuller - senior officer in the Imperial Army, amateur artist, renowned military historian and strategist, expert early theorist on armored warfare, respected author of over 3 dozen literary works, and committed occultist, esoteric, mystic, and Thelemite cultist. \n\nThe Thelemites, adherents and followers of Thelema, follow the new religious movement of English mystic, ceremonial magician, spiritualist, and writer Aleister Crowley, seeing him and his closest allies like Fuller as prophets of unhindered will in this new age. Following their own pantheon and theology that combines aspects of Paganism, Druidism, and bastardized Abrahamic belief with additional ideas taken from Eastern philosophy and Western mysticism. The heralds of the modern Neo-Paganism movement and scions of British Ultranationalism, Fuller and his Thelemite allies are a strange force to be reckoned with; barely understood but rabidly dedicated to their Anglocentric ideas that we so luckily happen to share.

With these Western Guardians at his back, he has begun to also radically alter the Canadian economy, pursuing a Corporatist structure supported by the shackled ‘Klan Capital’ theory of the American Ku Klux Klan and by his SocCred allies that dance along the Right-most fringes of the SocCred party championing ideas of ‘Social Credit Action’ in service of Taylor’s Natural Order.

Famous for their weekly soirées, knightly rituals, occasionally dabbling in the occult out of curiosity, and their devout adherence to Anglicized forms of Christianity, the English Mistery shall continue to erect new castles, military manufactories, knightly houses, and aristocratic estates across Canada as they carve the True North up into feudal domains under new lords and ladies, all to create a perfect society for the perfect English culture and race, all for the good of the Crown and the archaic dreams of Ludovici."

The King’s passing knowledge of French, gained from his former flame Princess Isabelle, has recently come in handy, as these two men have embarked on a good-will tour to help ease tensions in the contentious region of Quebec. The fact that Edward and Arcand are both fluent in French has greatly assisted the popularity of the Monarchy in Quebec, however many Anglophiles within the Government hold hostility towards the region and the Francophone population, which has proven disloyal to the King on many occasions. While our relations with the Algiers Governments are on good terms, many wonder if the loyalty of the French populace can be extended to their compatriots Quebec. Integralist and Catholic Fundamentalist groups in the region are willing to cooperate with the King and with Algiers, however their support hinges on the recognition of French Language and Culture, as well as the guarantees for the rights of Catholics within Canada. While we could elect just to ignore them, choosing to suppress the Québécois would certainly damage our relations with the French Exiles. "

Additionally, Arcand, along with the many right-wing Québécois intellectuals hold considerable hatred for "godless" France, considered as having abandoned Roman Catholicism, leaving Quebec as the last remnant of the "true" France that ended in 1789. Calling for a religious reformation that cleanses the one, true faith of all sinful excess while supporting Darnand’s other ideas and policies such as Militia Corporatism, Anglo-French supremacism, anti-Capitalism, knightly occultism, and more, Prime Minister Arcand shall rule as the True North’s own Darnand in order to secure the final bastion of Western Civilization, Catholicism, and White Exceptionalism from the beasts that prowl in the dark."

Usually crowded with the strange faces of Canada’s varied political Right and its neo-Feudalist fringes, each Soirée allows the true, purple-blooded and pure leaders of the Empire come together to discuss the fineries of life and their ambitions for our state while cutting loose in an expression of noble hedonism and aristocratic privilege. \n\nWith each night filled with knightly rituals and pseudo-historical noble ceremonies followed by the finest entertainment, orgies, drugs, liquor, art, decoration and more that is possibly imaginable, it is not common for something distracting enough to occur to throw an entire night out of whack, but such a feat has been accomplished by one of the newcomers to the Mistery and its parties. A young member of the IUP, Rotha Beryl Lintorn-Orman is one of the most recent additions to the Mistery’s guestlist after coming to national attention for her anti-Syndicalist, anti-Internationalist, and anti-Liberal rhetoric and her short-lived political run in her self-made conservative party, and has since come to Ludovici’s direct attention after her escapades this past evening. A known opium addict and heavy drinker, it would seem that Rotha indulged herself far too much for her own good, making a drunken fool of herself by interrupting an eyes-wide-shut group of intercoursing knights before passing out from the opium rush. Strung out and hungover, Ludovici met with Rotha the next day and gave her two options - join the Mistery as an official member, learning to party like this each week without making a boorish fool of herself, or continue her life of directionless, non-noble excess until it runs her into an early and shallow grave.

While those under [Root.GetLeader] were content at first to ignore these alarmists their voices, they have begun to gain undue traction among the Conservatives. In an effort to please them and to keep the Exiles, ever proud of their Britishness, the Government has announced ‘Shakespeare Day’. The day is officially to celebrate The Bard and all of his accomplishments; however as an unofficial second purpose the Day is also to celebrate the advances of British culture in general. According to the Proclamation in every city, town or village ‘of a sufficient size’ a Shakespearean Festival is to be conducted. While the minutiae of the festivals are left for localities to decide the proclamation calls on them to ‘celebrate the innumerable and undeniable contributions British society has had in the cultural and scientific realms’. While nationalists have condemned this as an attempt at cultural genocide, the Liberals have taken an understandably more moderate stance instead calling the celebrations ‘chauvenistic and a vain attempt to inflate the King’s ego’."

One such target of these pushes to ‘Canadianize’ our institutions is the Canadian National Anthem. As of now, Canada has had no national anthem, as we are still technically a dependency of the United Kingdom. This has led to ‘God Save the King’ being our de-jure national anthem ever since Canada’s creation. With Canada moving on from its Dominionist past, Parliament has moved to establish an official National Anthem for [CAN.GetNameDef]. Naturally the many sides of the Canadian political aisle have raised their voice in support of their own particular songs. Tories have denounced this entire debate, and have put forward God Save the King as the official national anthem. The two main choices for a truly Canadian song are ‘O Canada’ and ‘The Maple Leaf Forever’, which have served as competing de-facto Canadian anthems ever since Confederation. ‘The Maple Leaf Forever’, while undoubtedly a popular choice for some, is unpopular in French Canada due to the song’s noted English perspective. The most uncontroversial suggestion so far is the patriotic song ‘O Canada’. Being written in 1880 initially as a French-Canadian patriotic song. The song was translated into English in 1905 and has since become somewhat of an unofficial anthem. Its lyrics, origins and musical content would surely please all sides of the aisle, and serve as a song that all Canadians can feel proud singing."

With Britain Liberated and Canada’s status once more in the air, the question of Métis rights has once again been raised \n\n In 1876 Canada passed the Indian Act which even today governs how Canada interacts with their native inhabitants and the Reserves they live on. The reserves, much like their American Reservation cousins, have been expanded and shrunk by various Royal commissions since their establishment. While the Indian Act is relatively straightforward, a more complicated issue within the Act touches on the Métis. These so-called ‘Mixed Bloods’ born from European and Indian parents still have a complicated legal status. The Métis have struggled with recognition as a distinct Aboriginal people; with the question of where the line between European and Aboriginal is to be drawn permeating Métis and First Nations communities. Parliament has set out to formally settle this debate through a series of votes and hearings on the matter\n\n. Many feel like due to their shared kinship and ethnicity, the Métis should fall under the umbrella of the Indian Act despite Métis representatives not taking part in the signing of the ‘Numbered Treaties’. However forcing the Métis people into the reservations would be an unpopular solution for both parties.\n\n While many reservations existing in appalling conditions, numerous Métis have signaled that they feel more at home in the Indian Reservations than in the rest of Canada, and have asked the Government for permission to utilize the Reservation System. More narrow definitions of the Métis legal status would rob the ability for these peoples to choose to either live off the Reserve System or integrate with Canadians. \n\n While this issue is close to the hearts of many of Canada’s First Nations groups, the simple fact is that the majority of citizens, Exiles and Canadians both, couldn’t care less about this issue.

While this issue is far from pressing, Afro-Canadian advocacy groups have urged action. Despite Racism being frowned upon in many ways, there are no official laws and codes preventing this discrimination. Incidents of segregation and race based hate crimes have become scarily common in recent months, and if we wish to avoid the ugliness that has so often plagued the States, we must quickly address these systematic issues.

One way they have begun to do this is a growing love for hockey among the Exile populace. What was once a more or less a Canadian sport has begun to grow in popularity among the Britons in Canada, with more British players appearing in hockey drafts and more British fans accompanying their Canadian fans to games. Many British Hockey players, such as James Foster, Carl Erhardt, Edgar "Chirp" Brenchley and Jimmy Chappell have gained positions in Canadian leagues, playing alongside many British born Canadian players such as Alex Smith, Bobby Connors, Alex Gray, Eric Pettinger, Irv Frew and Sam McAdam. Due to the fact that most of Britain’s hockey players are Canadian, or have otherwise lived in Canada, hockey has fallen out of popularity within the United Kingdom, with the majority of Unionist hockey players being either French or Russian. \n\nThe reverse has also come to be, as more Canadians have grown to love football, (or soccer as some American influenced Canadians call it), as well as Cricket and Rugby. With British influences quickly getting a solid hold on the bustling radio and television networks, these networks' British backers have encouraged an increased coverage of these British games. These games, managed by the newly established Canadian Football League, make use of established British brands like Manchester United and Arsenal along with new Canadian teams like the Toronto City Club and Victoria Club.

After returning to Canada at the end of the Weltkrieg, Banting and his assistant Charles Best figured out how to remove insulin from a dog's pancreas in 1921. While this was far from the insulin we now know, it was a monumental step at the beginning of modern diabetes treatment. After a year of developing a pure and refined insulin form from cattle's pancreas with the assistance of J.B. Collip and John Macleod, a dying 14 year old boy would receive the first injection of insulin that would save his life - his dangerously high blood glucose levels miraculously stabilizing after the injection. Banting's work has spurred a revolution in diabetes medical care, saving countless lives. He and John Macleod won the Nobel Prize in 1923 for their crucial work and treatment of diabetes patients. Since then, he has been recognized as an example of human perseverance and courage in the face of adversity by millions of Canadians and people abroad.

British cultural customs have become commonplace within Canada, with the popularity of such Anglo culinary staples like Fish and Chips and Tea taking off in urban areas. Canadian cities are being redesigned to accommodate the Exiles, with the American-influenced infrastructure being re-oriented to match the design of British cities such as Manchester and London. Double-Decker buses have begun gracing the streets of London and Ottawa and Toronto, and London’s stereotypical Red Phone Booths and Mailboxes have begun to pop up on Canadian streets. This cultural fusion has led to a bizarre mishmash of British and Canadian culture forming, as Canadians have begun to speak with British accents, the RCMP adopting the ‘Bobby’ Custodian helmet in addition to their serge uniforms, and bizarre food combinations such as Maple Tea and Fish and Chips Poutine becoming common.

canada.440.d:0 "Since Canada's birth, it has had famous novelists and possesses rich multicultural literature written in French, English, Indigenous, and even Gaelic languages. The country, however, lacks children's literature, and children need stories that they can relate to and that will help them understand the world around them - and that is exactly what Lucy Maud Montgomery is doing. Born in November 1874, Montgomery is a prolific writer, publishing over a hundred stories between 1897 and 1907. However, one of her most notable works was released in 1908; Anne of Green Gables. It describes the adventures of Anne Shirley, an 11 year old orphan girl in the pastoral town community of fictional Avonlea, located on Prince Edward Island. The novel follows Anne's adventures and growth as she finds a home and family on the island. Although she encounters both struggles and triumphs, her own personal growth inspires readers of all ages. It is also imperative to mention that with her optimism, enthusiasm, and imagination, she quickly won the hearts of the townspeople. Despite the troubled times we are experiencing, the book offers something for us to learn from. Received with overwhelming critical success from around the globe, Montgomery's book has been deemed a classic and has paved the way for Canada's children's literature scene. Montgomery is also a staunch supporter of the Entente. Horrified by German atrocities in Belgium, she urged several young Canadian men to enlist in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, and celebrated every victory achieved during the First Weltkrieg."

canada.441.d:0 "There are wide reports that "the minnow swallowed the whale" in the newspaper publishing world, as Toronto-based underdog The Globe with its circulation of 78,000 readers has bought out the larger Toronto-based The Mail and Empire with its 118,000 readers. The Globe's reports on both the anti-slavery movements within the United States and Great Britain, and on the Crimean War have led it to become Canada's most renowned newspaper. Prior to the establishment of cable lines across the Atlantic between North America and Europe, it gained considerable sales on European mail days. It was praised by British Prime Minister William Gladstone for its coverage of the Crimean War. It was also the first to report the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The Globe had a reputation for being one of the most reliable sources of news in the region. Details of the merger reveal William Henry Wright, a successful mining magnate who served in both the Second Boer War and the Weltkrieg. The latter of which he was supposedly the most "wealthiest private" in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, hosting an astonishing net worth of a million dollars. George McCullagh, who worked for The Globe in his youth, fronted Wright in the deal and is supposed to be the first publisher of The Globe and Mail. Overall, the purchase was $1.3 million for the Globe and $2.5 million for the Mail and Empire respectively. This will cement The Globe and the Mail as one of Canada's prominent newspaper publishers."

Stewart Edward "Stu" Hart, born May 3, 1915, is a Canadian amateur wrestler who has helped establish a strong wrestling scene in Canada. Hart was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, and grew up in a large family of 12 children. He began wrestling in high school, and became a successful amateur wrestler, winning several championships. Although being drafted into the Royal Canadian Navy prevented him from starting his professional career, he has been appointed Director of Athletics within the navy. He will continue as an athletic director rather than as an enlisted seaman for the time being, since he wrestles mainly for the enjoyment of other servicemen. Film reel footage of him wrestling has significantly boosted his popularity across the nation. This is in addition to the thousands of other enlisted men in drill halls who watch him wrestle. For the most part, Hart has performed and organized different sports events to raise funds for Canada's struggles, both present and future. According to reports, he intends to open a wrestling school after completing his military service. Hart is committed to his country and wrestling. He hopes to use his newfound celebrity status to bring attention to Canada's needs. He's also determined to inspire others to pursue their dreams."

Working under his employer CM&S while operating between his three main labs in Spokane, Ottawa, and Vancouver, Hings has struck gold with this ingenious development, with this portable radio signaling system becoming immensely popular with the Canadian armed forces, widely becoming known as the ‘Walkie-Talkie’ in line with new colloquialisms developed by our first batch of veteran troops and special forces that have been rigorously field-testing the new and experimental hardware first hand. With initial tests proving more than fruitful, this backpack-mounted technology has begun to be distributed throughout the armed forces of the Commonwealth in the form of the mass-produced model C-58 Walkie-Talkie, particularly among infantry forces that pack light and travel far as a replacement for more clunky radio systems that only created an easy target for the enemy as a stationary structure or otherwise inhibited the movement of the company it was attached to as it was usually mounted a vehicle if used at all. Thanks to his ingenious invention and sense of innate patriotism and honor, the inventor Donald Hings has been nominated for the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire as he is elevated into the upper echelon of Canada’s greatest engineering minds."

Commonly called ‘RADAR’ or ‘radio detection and ranging’ as based on the name developed by the United States Navy in early prototype designs, this new technology will allow the Canadian and British militaries, primarily the Navy and air forces, to have a degree of early-detection unlike the world has ever seen. Thanks to Dr. Watson-Watt, the remnants of the British Empire shall be safer from ever before, for not even the vast expanse of the seas and skies can hide our enemies from us any longer."

canada.445.t:0 "The Spartan General"
canada.445.d:0 "Among all the exiles we have at both the Crown and Canada's disposal, the most unique of them is Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, referred to as "Monty" among troops. Born in Surrey in 1887, Montgomery spent his early years in Ulster, British Tasmania, and then returned to London to attend the Royal Military College at Sandhurst. After graduating in 1908, he joined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment as a commissioned officer. Not too long after, the Weltkrieg began, and Montgomery nearly died from a well-placed German shot to the right lung during the First Battle of Ypres. Although a grave was prepared for his expected death, Montgomery recovered fully and served as a staff officer for the rest of the conflict. It was here that he noted and criticized the wasteful tactics of the “good fighting generals” such as Sir Douglas Haig, who had reduced the lives of their soldiers to mere cannon fodder. He was appalled at the lack of leadership, seeing no senior commander ever step on the front to establish a sense of understanding between them and the soldiers they sent forth to die. After the end of the war with the Peace with Honor, Montgomery luckily managed to be accepted into the Staff College at Camberley. This ensured his only hope of a high command position. He graduated in 1921 and participated in the final stages of the Irish War of Independence. However, with the crumbling economy and instability of the government, Montgomery soon witnessed the culmination of events that resulted in the spectacular disintegration of the British Empire. He was in Surrey at Camberley Staff College when the first sparks of the revolution occurred with the Port Talbot Riots. As the situation quickly deteriorated, he was posted to the Territorial Army as a Major and went to the frontlines in Wales. Montgomery became an excellent leader and strategist of the British forces. As a result of his efforts, the British Army had limited success during the civil war. He was later promoted to the rank of General to coordinate the remaining Royalist forces in the British Isles. However, as Scotland and Wales fell to Socialist forces, Montgomery's forces were confined to the West and East Midlands. They were soon sent into forced retreat south towards London after Nottingham's fall and anxiously prepared for the final blow. With limited amounts of material, constant bombardment, increasing desertions, and London in chaos - Montgomery was evacuated through Brighton weeks before London's inevitable fall. Socialist forces controlled England, with only pockets of resistance in a few isolated areas. The remnants of the British army were scattered and disorganized, with no hope of regrouping and fighting back. The war was lost, but Montgomery successfully fled to Canada. Over the next decade, Montgomery would play a key role in the reorganization of Canada's forces and the eventual return to England. Montgomery's leadership and tactical skills helped transform Canada's troops into semi-professional troops, although manpower is a concern. By 1936, Montgomery was now a Field Marshal, steadily building up Canada's forces and maintaining control over the remaining overseas dominions such as India with military assistance throughout the past decade. Regardless of the cost, he remains committed to fighting the Socialist menace across the Atlantic.."

Praised for its smoothness, the uniquely Canadian whisky has notes of vanilla and caramel, with a long finish which grants hints of oak, chocolate and spice. Despite being introduced only a short time ago, already the whisky has taken the Canadian market by storm. Due to this smash hit, almost overnight, the Seagram Company has risen to become one of the largest alcohol producers in the entire country. If this success proves to just be a fluke due to the popularity of King Edward, or a lasting impact on the market, remains to be seen.

canada.448.d:0 "As we have set out to reform and build up the Royal Navy, most questions usually refer to doctrine, and equipment. However, one of the largest questions and what many see as a problem, is the behavior of the actual sailors in the Navy. Off duty sailors are known far and wide for their wildness when on shore leave. While it has many causes, one of the largest many reformers fear, is that of the Rum Ration. Issued daily since 1850, the Rum Ration is an eighth of a pint of 95.5 proof Rum. While the amount of Rum given can vary from ship to ship, reformers fear that this freely flowing booze helps sailors develop a stomach for alcohol, making them drink even more when on shore leave, causing the mayhem sailors are known for. Due to this, many reformers within the government are pressing for the Navy to end the rum ration, thus hopefully improving the popular image of sailors, thus opening the Royal Navy up to more recruits, or so the theory goes. Beyond this, they say that having sober sailors will make ships much safer. Officers and sailors who have caught wind of this plan have condemned it outright, saying that the ration greatly helps morale, and that it would have little to no effect on the behaviors of men who have been at sea for mouths. Instead, they say that if anything should be done, the Rum Ration should be increased, although most simply wish for it to be left as it is. In any case, with such an issue pressing at the government's doorstep, it cannot simply be overlooked, especially when it could potentially help in the fight against the Syndies."

canada.449.d:0 "Today, much to the sadness of sailors of the Royal Navy across the Empire, the Rum Ration, a tradition dating back to 1655, has officially been issued for the last time. Sailors have acted out in different ways as a result of this loss of the Rum Ration. Most but certainly not all, expressed their dissatisfaction by wearing black armbands or by burrying their tots at sea, throwing their empty glasses overboard. In one case, a training camp in Canada held a mock funeral, with a coffin filled to the brim with empty glasses, preceded by pipers and drummers. In any case, for the final time around the Empire, glasses were raised, some in toast to the King, others to Davy Jones. Reformers, pleased with the results, expect that with the ending of the Ration, not only will safety aboard Royal Navy ships improve greatly, but the overall image of the Navy will improve as well, as no longer will drunken sailors cause chaos on shore leave. In any case, the Rum Ration is no more, for better or worse."

canada.450.d:0 "It has been almost 5 years since the Admiralty, at the behest of reformers, made the decision to formally end the Rum Ration. In that time, the image of the Royal Navy, much to the chagrin of the reformers, has improved little. While safety incidents are down greatly, it came at the cost of morale. While Naval Rum is no longer in production, several barrels were still in the process of aging, and seeing nothing better to do with them, the government sold these to private companies. This selective release proved to be highly popular, with sailors who remembered the taste with fondness, and civilians who enjoyed the mystique and complex flavors of the rum.  Due to this, the companies that sold the rum made a fortune, and many expressed sadness that it was such a limited release. Not all of these companies, however, have taken the loss of such a massive profit sitting down.\n\nSamuel Bronfman, president of the Seagram Company, personally approached the Admiralty with an offer to buy the formula that has been used since 1850 to produce Navy Rum. This offer has lit up the Admiralty like a christmas tree, as debate as to what exactly to do with the formula has suddenly become the chance to make a large amount of money. Most with the Admiralty wish to accept Bronfman's offer, and sell the formula. Others however, wish to start up production under the Navy's own watch, and either sell the Rum directly to the public or to distribution companies, to open up a new revenue source for the Royal Navy. In any case, Bronfman is not a patient man, and he made it clear that he is expecting a response soon, lest the very debate be for nothing."

Notable for staging a hunger strike and a mass-walkout at his school that both ended in failure as his classmates just took the strike time as time to goof off and skip school, his rivalry with his local principal that thwarts his every attempt at wider activism and their feud-fueled debate on whether the masses are just bored or truly apathetic towards real change, his accidental instigation of further rioting, and for his demented dedication to living as closely as he can to as Trotsky did - complete with his dream of marrying an older woman named Alexandra, his adoration of penguins, and goal of leading his people towards a Socialist enlightenment as Trotsky himself did, the young activist shows that there is at least some support out there for Quebecois-Canadian unity, no matter how strange the source may be."

The Canadian decision to retain Entente leadership has caused a passive rage by those within the UK, all the more fueled by the fact that there is nothing they can do about the Canadian betrayal. While Canada on paper swears loyalty to the Crown and the King in London, the simple truth is that the United Kingdom is no longer the dominant partner in Anglo-Canadian relations. The influence wielded by the former British Empire is now held by [CAN.GetNameDef], with the United Kingdom itself playing second-fiddle to its former colony.

From the Liberation itself to the generous investments from Canada, to the various Canadian supplied aid packages that have become commonplace, Canada is unquestionably committed to helping the mother-country recover.

To the West Indian usurpers we can only say that they must prepare themselves, for the Entente shall not rest, shall not waver, until its corrupt and unjust government has been toppled and the West Indians who so bravely fight against them are restored their freedom.

Our alliance cannot merely grieve for the devastation, however. We must stand ready to act, for the fate of America is inextricably linked to our own.

Since inheriting his father's throne however, King Edward has been far too busy with the duties of state to throw down. While still sneaking in a small gathering or two, the King's once wild lifestyle has greatly tamed, with him becoming a much formal and dutiful man. Due to this, along with him having expressed some interest in meeting the famed stars of Hollywood, it comes as no surprise that King Edward VIII has been formally invited to an incredibly exclusive gala, where only the most powerful and famous are welcomed. Said to be hosted by some of the wildest people in Hollywood, there is no doubt that such a night will be one to remember. While usually such a thing would be of little note, the Exile Community has exploded in debate, as the King was also invited to a large family function of the House of Orléans, once rulers of the Kingdom of France. This function, said to be a great gathering of the House and its allies, is to take place at the same time as the Gala. Due to this, the King can only attend one of them. While such a scheduling conflict is normal among royal houses, what has made it such a political topic of debate among the Exiles is the implications. It is a well known fact that the King is currently unmarried and while not short of possible consorts, has yet to truly settle anyone in particular. Due to this, many within the Exiles, not helped by various yellow journalistic rags, have begun to suspect that wherever the King chooses to go, he may try to find someone to wed. While little backs this up, Prince Jean of Orléans, claimant to the French Throne, has allegedly been trying to get Edward VIII to marry his daughter, Princess Isabelle of Orléans. Recently widowed, Princess Isabelle and King Edward have actually met previously, and while some initial romance, ended up not going anywhere with it, due in no small part to the Princess' husband still being alive.\n\nWith these two invitations starting to create no small discord among the rumor-crazed Exile community.

The logical choice would be Prince Albert - he is the eldest heir and favorite of the late King George, though there is concern regarding both his health and his profound lack of social ability. Is he the right choice to lead the Empire? With normal succession already thrown out the window, it would be possible for another prince to be chosen. Prince Henry is considered a biddable man, and has military experience that would be of great use. Prince George, meanwhile, is the youngest but is charismatic - and already has a son, to ensure a future king to follow him."

King Edward is the nominal head of the Church of England, an institution which does not permit a divorcee to remarry, and thus the scandal of such a marriage was too much for many. Even so, the king's popularity in the Empire has won the day.

While it is currently unclear how far such 'co-operation' would go, it seems worth the attempt. A representative from [This.GetNameDef] has been asked to attend."
entente.303.a:0 "We'll be there!"

entente.304.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference"
entente.304.d:0 "Leaders from the Entente and the Reichspakt gathered in [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] today in order to discuss the possibility of co-operation in the war against the Third Internationale. What this co-operation would consist of was not difficult to ascertain: military and naval access between all members, but - more importantly, for the Entente - the willingness on the part of the Reichspakt to stay out of both France and Great Britain once the war is done. This would allow for a swift return to Europe for the French and British exile governments, the ultimate goal of both, but now a single question hangs over the conference: would [GER.GetNameDef] even agree to such terms, and if so what would they ask in return?"
entente.304.a:0 "That's an excellent question"

entente.305.t:0 "Our Demands"
entente.305.d:0 "Staying out of both France and Great Britain in the peace conference following our future victory would mean [GER.GetNameDef] walking away from a long and costly war with little to show for it - and possibly two restored neighbors who we have vanquished previously and who have no reason to be fond of us. We cannot rely on their gratitude... so do we even consider the idea? What do we ask for in return?"
entente.305.t.return:0 "Do We Demand More?"
entente.305.d.return:0 "We have made it this far in the negotiations. Do we demand more concessions from the Entente, or have we reached a successful conclusion to the treaty?"

entente.305.f:0 "Let us proceed to the treaty"
entente.305.g:0 "This discussion is pointless - we will never co-operate"

entente.306.t:0 "The Conference Goes Nowhere"
entente.306.d:0 "It appears it was barely worth the delegates even coming to [ENT.GetConferenceLocation]. While the Germans initially appeared willing to talk, the idea of completely staying out of both France and Great Britain didn't appeal. They claimed they would come out of a long and costly war with nothing to show for it, and none of the delegates could convince them anything the Entente would part with would be worth their while. The delegates from the Reichspakt are already returning home, and the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference has been deemed an utter failure."
entente.306.a:0 "They asked for too much!"
entente.306.b:0 "What a waste of time"

entente.307.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Alsace-Lorraine"
entente.307.d:0 "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their co-operation: that our government publicly renounce all future claims to Alsace-Lorraine. It's no surprise, really, and while there's nothing to stop us from re-claiming it after the war is done it will certainly appear like an illegitimate act. Our allies might not even support us in such an endeavour. Or perhaps the Germans just wish us to humiliate ourselves, to renounce something everyone knows is ours, for co-operation they probably need as much as we do."
entente.307.a:0 "We will never renounce Alsace-Lorraine!"
entente.307.b:0 "Very well, we agree"

entente.308.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.308.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegate has refused to give up their claim to Alsace-Lorraine - not even for the help they desperately need to return to the continent. They are too proud to give up a claim to something they cannot possibly hope to recover."
entente.308.a:0 "That's it for the conference, then"
entente.308.b:0 "We'll put this demand aside, for now"

entente.309.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Alsace-Lorraine"
entente.309.d:0 "Shockingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegates have agreed - after much discussion with the Germans - to publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine... if the Germans agree to the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference's treaty of co-operation. Considering the humiliation involved for the French to do so, it speaks much of how much they believe the treaty will help their return to the continent."
entente.309.a:0 "That is a relief"
entente.309.b:0 "A sweet admission on their part"
entente.309.c:0 "We have little choice"
entente.309.e:0 "How unexpected"

entente.310.d:0 "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their co-operation: once we have returned to Paris, we will join Mitteleuropa - the German economic union. No doubt they wish to ensure they economically dominate us as we rebuild the country... though rebuilding would also go much more quickly with their assistance, it's true. Do we swallow this pill? It's not impossible that we could simply refuse once Paris is ours, though there will undoubtedly be consequences for doing so."
entente.310.a:0 "No, we will not surrender our independence"
entente.310.b:0 "Very well, we agree"

entente.311.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.311.d:0 "It seems the French will not even accept an offered hand of assistance, believing that membership in Mitteleuropa would allow us to economically dominate their country. And they are correct, of course. Surely they did not think we'd allow France to restore itself without us having some kind of control? Now we must ask ourselves whether this is worth ending the conference over."
entente.311.a:0 "It certainly is!"
entente.311.b:0 "No, we must press forward"

entente.312.t:0 "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join Mitteleuropa"
entente.312.d:0 "The German delegation has demanded that [NFA.GetNameDef] agree to join Mitteleuropa, the German economic union, after Paris has been regained. Most present at the conference believe the Germans intend to have some form of economic control over the French as they rebuild their country, but possibly their offer is benign. Whatever the motivation, the French have agreed: when the time comes, they will join Mitteleuropa as requested."
entente.312.a:0 "Ah, good"
entente.312.b:0 "We'll believe it when we see it"
entente.312.c:0 "How humiliating"
entente.312.e:0 "Interesting"

entente.313.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Our Former Colonies"
entente.313.d:0 "The German delegates at the conference have a demand: essentially, that the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia which Germany gained after the First Weltkrieg be recognized as theirs. It's a symbolic move, perhaps, but the Germans would like to forestall any attempts on our part to re-establish our old empires in those regions once our power is regained. That we would even be prepared to go to war for our far-flung colonies is hard to imagine, but - even so - the idea of abandoning them completely does sting."
entente.313.a:0 "We will not abandon our colonies"
entente.313.b:0 "They have already been lost"

entente.314.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.314.d:0 "Interestingly, even though the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia have been lost for decades, now, [From.GetNameDef] has still refused to let them go. They would be 'abandoning' their former charges, as they see it, and will not relinquish even their moral claim to their colonies. Now we must decide whether this is enough to end the conference. It is not, after all, like their refusal to recognize our colonies means they are any less ours."
entente.314.a:0 "Clearly they do not want co-operation enough"
entente.314.b:0 "It was a minor matter - let's move on"

entente.315.t:0 "German Colonies Recognized"
entente.315.d:0 "The French and British colonies gained by the Germans since the First Weltkrieg have been a sticking point - some annexed, others occupied 'temporarily' due to the lack of what the Germans claimed was a competent government to administer them. Now the Germans have demanded the colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia be officially recognized as theirs, forestalling future efforts to see them restored, and the Entente has agreed. It's a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that could prevent a great deal of conflict in the future."
entente.315.a:0 "It will be worth it"
entente.315.b:0 "Good"
entente.315.c:0 "Just get us to Paris"
entente.315.e:0 "Interesting"

entente.316.t:0 "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Northern Ireland"
entente.316.d:0 "The German delegates have done something unexpected: after discussion with their Irish allies, they have presented a demand from us - the British government must renounce future claims to Northern Ireland. It is no small thing, effectively annulling the Acts of Union and breaking apart the United Kingdom once and for all. Considering the Irish were never planning on relinquishing the land without a war, perhaps it is best that the question be settled now."
entente.316.a:0 "We won't be forced into this, not by Germany"
entente.316.b:0 "So be it, we agree"

entente.317.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.317.d:0 "The British government has refused to give on the matter of Northern Ireland. Annulling the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, they say, is too large a matter to be decided here and now - the British delegates question whether they even have the authority to make such a promise. The Irish delegates are, of course, infuriated."
entente.317.a:0 "Too bad, we're done"
entente.317.b:0 "We won't end this for Ireland's sake"

entente.318.t:0 "The British Renounce Northern Ireland"
entente.318.d:0 "Today has caused much uproar at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: the German delegates, acting on behalf of their Irish allies, have demanded that the British renounce all claims to Northern Ireland. Even so it would annul the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, the British delegates have agreed to do so. They do not wish to war with the Irish, of all people, and while they have said the matter should in the end rest with the citizens of Northern Ireland themselves, they will not personally press British claims."
entente.318.a:0 "It had to be done"
entente.318.b:0 "I cannot believe they agreed to that"
entente.318.c:0 "Hah! I bet they renege!"

The main terms of the deal involve both sides having military and naval access to the other, but - more importantly - [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed that, once the syndicalists have been beaten, they will take no territory in France or Great Britain and thus allow both the French and British exiled governments a swift return to Europe. Sources at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference say that the Germans elicited a host of promises from Entente leaders, though it remains to be seen whether - once the war is done, should they prove victorious - either side ultimately intends to keep them."

Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to send a few models to the major allies, allowing our armies and the armies of our friends to utilize this unique technology. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, rotabuggies, and other novel transports devised by crack scientists and our allied lackeys, we shall be able to ferry our populace, our goods, and our troops all around the world without issue or delay while also delivering devastating payloads at a moment’s notice.

The centerpiece inventions of these new shipments are the Sikorsky R-4 and the Platt-LePage XR-1, along with the experimental Type 171 Sycamore of Anglo design. These ‘hoverflies’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these helicopters have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers while also being adept at recon and supply. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Anglos sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of our alliance."

While the British still technically lord over us, there is little they could do if we ultimately decide to retain our leadership position against their wishes. If we do go forth with the decision to stay in control of the Entente, it is likely that we would move to rebrand the Entente, divorcing it from its past as a collection of British Colonies and Exiles States, and reinventing our faction as a force for peace and stability in the New World"

Unfortunately, due to Britain exerting their control while in exile, there is little we could do, even if Britain retakes their leadership position against our wishes. The fact that Britain has exerted such a degree of control over Canadian affairs is the source of a great deal of bitterness, with many viewing the Exiles as an ungrateful occupying force. There is a growing feeling that Canada should abandon Britain, and forge its own path as a great power in its own right, and if they are to succeed, it would mean the end of Canada’s membership in the Entente."

As we work to redefine the character of our organisation, the question of what our foreign policy interactions will consist of is a subject of heated debate. Many support the idea that the Commonwealth is to be an alliance to preserve Democracy on a Global Scale; even resorting to using force to preserve freedom if need be. They state that we must use our military prowess to protect our interests and forge a ‘World Safe for Democracy’.

## Imperial Fed Events

imp_fed.1.t:0 "An Invitation to the Imperial Federation"
imp_fed.1.d:0 "Once but a dream of the British Colonial Project, since returning from exile, the British government has been seemingly working towards a realization of the unification of the entire Empire as a single nation state. Today, it appears that these rumors have proved correct, as the British government has formally invited our government to join them in the creation of an Imperial Super State. Promising a massive boon to the economy and national stability, the British have made it clear that while we have every right to refuse, they might not take no for an answer. In any case, with the Federation seeming closer every day, London is awaiting our response with baited breath."
imp_fed.1.a:0 "We have awaited this day, accept at once!"
imp_fed.1.b:0 "They must be joking? Such an entity would surely collapse overnight!"

imp_fed.2.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Accepts our Proposal"
imp_fed.2.d:0 "Following a short period of debate, the government of [FROM.GetName] has formally agreed to join us as we march towards an Imperial Federation. With their agreement, we are one step closer to uniting the Empire into a singular state. While integration will take years, if not decades, that process can begin unhindered. Even with the government's agreement, they are still but one piece of the puzzle, and it remains to be seen if the remaining pieces can truly fit together."  
imp_fed.2.a:0 "Splendid!"

imp_fed.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses our Proposal"
imp_fed.3.d:0 "Much to the dismay of many within the Colonial Office, [FROM.GetName] has refused to consent to joining the Imperial Federation. While an understandable decision, it would mean an end to the autonomy they have enjoyed since the exile, it is still something of a gutpunch, like a child rebelling against their parent. While normally, such a decision would be the end of our efforts, times have changed. His Majesty, nominally anyway, is the King of [FROM.GetName], who's authority is exercised and represented by a Governor-General. With this being the case, all it would take is a word, and [FROM.GetName]'s government could be dissolved, replaced by an appointed one, one that would consent where [FROM.GetLeader] and their government has not. While such a move would be a first of its kind, the dream of the Imperial Federation, if we wish for it to be a reality, may just require it. Already, members of the Colonial Office have presented the King with a document which could make this decree a reality, all he has to do is sign, and the dream of an Imperial Federation is that much closer."  
imp_fed.3.a:0 "They shall be made to accept!"
imp_fed.3.b:0 "We cannot sweep aside their government in such an abrasive manner."

imp_fed.4.t:0 "An End to Self-Government?"
imp_fed.4.d:0 "After having refused to willingly join Britain's no doubt doomed plans of an Imperial Federation, it would appear that the Crown has not appreciated our response. Today, our Governor-General has moved to formally dissolve our government and replace it with one that shall go along with the Imperial Federation scheme. Coming directly via royal decree, to the British, [root.getleader]'s government technically no longer exists. While legally, such a move is well within the right of the King to make, it flies in the face of true British values. In an attempt to make the transition somewhat easier, the Governor-General has not gone public with this order, hoping to simply have the government resign to avoid an even larger scandal. Due to this, many within the cabinet, and even [root.getleader] themselves have considered not resigning, and declaring independence from Britain. While such an action would be radical, it would perhaps be the only way to ensure that our sovereignty remains."
imp_fed.4.a:0 "The King has overstepped! Down with British rule!"
imp_fed.4.b:0 "We have no choice, resign our seats at once."

imp_fed.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Declares Independence"
imp_fed.5.d:0 "In a shocking move that flies in the face of British Legality, our 'loyal' subjects in [FROM.GetName] have formally renounced British rule! Making known to the world that the King had 'attempted to end our sovereignty and legal mandate,' the fools have revolted, swearing to fight to ensure their survival. We obviously cannot allow such an insult to go unpunished. Already, the Royal Navy has been prepped for the journey, and several areas to make landfall have been charted. [FROM.GetName] shall be put down, and the Imperial Federation created, no matter the cost."
imp_fed.5.a:0 "We shall make quick work of them."

imp_fed.6.t:0 "Groundwork for the Imperial Federation Laid"
imp_fed.6.d:0 "The work is done, the dream of a united Anglosphere is closer to reality than ever before. After years of struggling, the Empire, once on the brink, is now more powerful than ever. All that remains is to ratify the Imperial Federation's Constitution. Due to its nature as a nation uniting enterprise, all constituent nations of the Empire must ratify the document on their own. While it is expected that such an event is little more than a formality, it appears this may not be so. The bill which would ratify the Imperial Constitution, bringing an end to our own individual nationhood, has divided parliament, more so than anything in our history. While understandable, with the government's own support of the bill, to see division this clear cut and deep, when Imperial unity is so close, the opposition is threatening everything we have worked towards. What's more, London has been breathing down [root.getleader]'s neck, demanding that ratification is completed soon, or else. Due to this, many within the cabinet have begun pressing for [root.getleader] to use their influence to get the bill passed ASAP. What's more however, a group from the opposition have also begun pressing for our beloved leader to back their side. With such a national divide, and with the Colonial Office threatening to enforce the bill anyway, many close to [root.getleader] fear he must make a decision soon, lest the gridlock in parliament get any worse."
imp_fed.6.a:0 "Support the bill, God Save the Empire!"
imp_fed.6.b:0 "This is our last chance, Down with the Federation!"

imp_fed.7.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Ratify!"
imp_fed.7.d:0 "In a shocking move, the government of [FROM.GetName] has narrowly failed to pass a bill which would ratify the Imperial Condition, the last step towards the Imperial Federation. Allegedly due to the influence of [FROM.GetLeader], with the failure of the bill, the nation has refused to join the Federation. This treachery cannot stand! Already, the Royal Navy has been informed, and invasion plans are being drawn. If they want a fight, they will have it. For the Empire shall be one, and none can stop that now. God Save the King, God Save the Empire! "
imp_fed.7.a:0 "The Empire shall strike them down!"

imp_fed.8.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Joins Us"
imp_fed.8.d:0 "In a not surprising move, the government of [FROM.GetName] has formally ratified the Imperial Constitution, thus joining us in the dream of a United Empire. While the vote was a narrow one, thanks to the influence of [FROM.GetLeader], it passed handily. With their ratification, yet another nation unites into the warm embrace of the Imperial Federation, a home for all true Britons!"
imp_fed.8.a:0 "Long Live the Empire!"

imp_fed.9.t:0 "Foundation of the Imperial Federation"
imp_fed.9.d:0 "After years of exile, doubters proclaimed we would never return home, but we did. After years of strife, doubters proclaimed we would never peace, but we do. After years of attempts, doubters proclaimed we would never birth a united Imperial state, but we have. The dream and logical end point of the colonial project has been met, and every single Brit, from Ottawa to London, from Kingston to Sydney, is united in a single state. Where there was once doubt and depression within the hearts of Imperial citizens, a new hope for the future has arisen. The Empire, almost wiped out in 1925, has truly been struck back into the pages of history, and the return of the Empire shall never again be doubted. While integration proper will take decades we shall face the challenges it poses as one, with no division between us as a people. The Imperial Federation is at last a reality, and with God on our side shall never fall. We will no doubt face many challenges ahead, but for now we can rest, knowing our work is nearing competition."
imp_fed.9.a:0 "You are Englishmen, and have subsequently drawn the greatest prize in the lottery of life."

imp_fed.10.t:0 "Creation of the Imperial Federation"
imp_fed.10.d:0 "Today, in a joint announcement from the capitals of nearly all nations within the British Commonwealth, the merger of the entire Commonwealth into a so-called 'Imperial Federation' was declared. Coming following years of struggle to reclaim their home, the British exiles, merging their Empire in this fashion, are completing what they call the logical endpoint of British Colonialism, that being the unification of the Empire itself into a single entity. With this Federation's creation, many are wondering what is next for the British Empire, now one. Even more are wondering, perhaps more importantly, just how long can an entity this large, this spread out, can actually survive. If this Imperial Federation proves to be the next step in British global domination or a failed national experiment, remains to be seen."
imp_fed.10.a:0 "Long Live the Empire?"

imp_fed.11.t:0 "The Direction of Hargrave’s Imperial Federation"
imp_fed.11.d:0 "With the Spirit Chief, White Fox, and Prime Minister John Hargrave working to spread the ideas of the Kibbo Kift Kindred and the Social Credit party to the farthest reaches of the old British Empire, a debate has cropped about as to what should be the symbol for this new international union. Though the traditional concept of the Imperial Federation is rooted in imperialism, Anglo supremacism, British exceptionalism, and other non-egalitarian concepts ill fitting with the rest of the Kindred’s ideology, the plan still holds merit and wide support with most Conservatives and Right-wingers within the Empire. However, Hargrave and his allies in the Kindred have pushed for a more unique take on the old concept that infuses Kindred ideas directly into the attitudes and actions of the new international government, like a focus on egalitarianism, fitness, environmentalism, patriotism, militarism, class collaboration, and peaceful cooperation of all humanity within the Empire, regardless of if they are Anglo-blooded or not. If we were to pursue this alternate form of the Imperial Federation idea, Hargrave and the Kibbo Kift would work to build a new international Kindred for all mankind living in the lands of the fallen Empire, or perhaps even taking such an idea further by infusing more of their anachronistic beliefs into it by presenting this new unions as a modern interpretation of Neorxnawang - the concept of Christian heaven as perceived by the ancient Anglo-Saxons in their literature that is described as a heavenly meadow, or a naturalistic paradise free from toil and worry. Regardless of our choice, the new Imperial Federation shall rise all the same."
imp_fed.11.a:0 "Stand by the standard Anglo-supremacist concept of the Imperial Federation."
imp_fed.11.b:0 "Create a more peaceful Imperial union based on the egalitarianism of the Kindred."
imp_fed.11.c:0 "The Kindred under the White Fox will build a new Neorxnawang for all Anglos!"

## Fate of Japan

entente_japan.1.t:0 "The Anglo-Japanese Alliance"
entente_japan.1.d:0 "The Anglo-Japanese alliance began in 1902 as an agreement between our two great island nations to assist and safeguard each other's interests in Asia and oppose Russian expansionism in the Far East. It ended unceremoniously in 1922, following the failures of the Weltkrieg and disagreements at the Copenhagen Conference. Since then, our circumstances have changed greatly, and now both of our nations are embroiled in war with the Great Powers. Perhaps there is an opportunity to revive this old alliance and work to our mutual benefit for the defeat of the Kaiser and the Commune?"
entente_japan.1.a:0 "Yes! Send the envoys!"
entente_japan.1.b:0 "Don't bother."

entente_japan.2.t:0 "The Anglo-Japanese Alliance"
entente_japan.2.d:0 "The British of Canada wish to revive the old Anglo-Japanese alliance between our peoples. It served us well during the Russo-Japanese war, keeping the French out of the conflict, and served to organize imperial expansion and management in Asia. We share many enemies, both the Syndicalists and the Germans, but some of the Emperor's most loyal advisors recommend against commitment to the Entente. It would embroil Japan in the wars against the French Commune and the British Revolutionaries! A non-aggression pact would be a compromise; a face-saving method of showing our good feelings to the British of Canada without committing Japanese troops to die for their cause."
entente_japan.2.a:0 "Let us fight the Commune and Kaiser!"
entente_japan.2.b:0 "A Non-Aggression Treaty will suffice."
entente_japan.2.c:0 "What nonsense."

entente_japan.3.t:0 "The Japanese Response"
entente_japan.3.d:0 "I bring word from His Majesty, the Emperor. An alliance once existed between Japanese and Britons. Long ago we fought and died together. We come to honor that allegiance. We are proud to fight alongside Britons once more."
entente_japan.3.a:0 "You are most welcome!"

entente_japan.4.t:0 "The Japanese Response"
entente_japan.4.d:0 "His Majesty, the Emperor, believes it would be... difficult to commit the Japanese navy to a fight to reclaim the British Isles and defeat the French Commune. However, he is ready to express his abiding friendship with the British people in the form of a Non-Aggression Treaty."

## Peace in the Civil War

acw_peace.1.t:0 "A United Front Against the Syndies?"
acw_peace.1.d:0 "As the Civil War drags ever onwards, many have begun to fear that the conflict for the soul of America, having already dragged on for so long, may simply continue indefinitely. Enemies remain on all sides, and it seems every time a breakthrough is made, the gap is closed all the sooner. However, it seems that an opportunity to finally end this war may have materialized. The Canadians to our north, whom have recently reclaimed the British Isles, have approached each faction with a proposal to finally end this bloody conflict. Seeming to think that their liberation of Britain has made them the new world power in North America, Canada has brought forth a two-step peace plan, to restore America to a state of peace and unity. Firstly, each faction shall enter into a ceasefire, with the exception of the damned Syndicalists. Each surviving faction shall focus down the Syndicalists, while ceasing to fight each other. Once the beast of Syndicalism is put down, part two of the peace plan can begin.  A national referendum shall be held to decide by popular vote which faction shall rule America, and which shall receive Canadian recognition. The referendum will be organized by Canadian peacekeepers, as to avoid any tampering with the results. Canada also made barely-veiled threats, that should the peace process fail, they would bring about peace by force of arms.\n\nWhile a novel proposal, and perhaps the quickest way to end this bloody conflict, there is no telling the actual chances of success. For while we are all Americans, we have been behind trenches so long that many would rather forget that. Be that as it may, a chance to just put down the dogs of the Combined Syndicates may give us the edge we need to finally win this war, thus some think we should agree to this peace process, until we can get the upper hand on our enemies. With the nation still in wartime, such an important decision falls to [root.getleader] to make."
acw_peace.1.a:0 "Very well, we shall have peace, at least for now."
acw_peace.1.b:0 "Bah! The Canadians have a snowball's chance in hell to end this war!"

acw_peace.2.t:0 "The Fate of Peace"
acw_peace.2.d:0 "With the rabid dogs of the CSA finally put down, the Canadian government has moved to begin Phase Two for their plans for an American peace. In short order, Canadian peacekeepers shall flood south, setting up voting booths in conjunction with local governments. In but a short time, this senseless conflict shall be over, the referendum shall take place and America will be reunited, at least in theory. Many within [root.getleader]'s government have begun calling for a renewing of hostilities with the other factions, attacking when they least expect it. In an effort to avoid being called oath breakers, this faction in the government says we can frame this by stating we only agreed to putting down the Syndies, nothing else. By framing it this way, we can avoid international repercussions, or so they claim anyway. While we may have gained somewhat of a better position with the downfall of the Red Belt, many doubt if it's truly a good enough position to actually win the war. Besides, we are this close to having peace in our time, is plunging the nation back into war really worth it?"
acw_peace.2.a:0 "We have come this far, our fate lies with the people now."
acw_peace.2.b:0 "We can end this war now, begin preparations to resume the conflict!"

acw_peace.3.t:0 "American Reunification Referendum Scheduled"
acw_peace.3.d:0 "After a brief period of silence from the various American factional governments, a silence that Canadian observers interpreted as preparations for a renewal of conflict, confirmation has been received that indeed the referendum shall take place. Canadian peacekeepers have thus begun to establish polling places throughout the vast wastelands that America has become. While having only the best intentions in mind, it appears that the American people have not taken well to an armed force setting up shop in their local towns, even if it is to end the most bloody conflict in American history. Several altercations have taken place, which while usually ending peacefully, there have been reports of shots fired, with a few civilians being killed as a result. To help calm their people, the various factional governments have urged calm, telling the citizenry that the Canadians are here only to help, advice that most citizens have listened to. The factional governments have also begun massive propaganda efforts, with the goal of assuring their victory in the coming referendum. Be it use of radio ads, television ads or even in print, the factions are willing to do almost anything to ensure that they are recognized as America's rightful government. While these campaigns have remained mostly tame, in a few cases, planes that only a few weeks ago had been dropping bombs on enemy targets, began dropping leaflets, extorting the glories of their respective factional government. With the referendum set to take place in the next few weeks, hope has begun to resurface in the American people, a hope that peace finally might becoming after such a long and bloody conflict."
acw_peace.3.a:0 "And so ends this Wicked War."

acw_peace.4.t:0 "Referendum on the Fate of America"
acw_peace.4.d:0 "After weeks of preparation, Phase Two of the Canadian peace plan has finally come to pass. Throughout the nation, war-weary citizens enter polling booths, manned by Canadian peacekeepers, to peacefully elect a government for America once and for all. While the voting itself is expected to take but a day, the actual counting of the votes may take weeks. In an effort to avoid rampant voter fraud, which many higher-ups in the Canadian peacekeeping mission feared, ballots shall be counted by Canadians, overseen by representatives of all factions, in hopes of deterring fraud. Regardless, as the final polls close and counting begins, it becomes clear that the American people have voted in favor of..."
acw_peace.4.a:0 "...the federalist United States!"
acw_peace.4.b:0 "...the populist Union State!"
acw_peace.4.c:0 "...the democratic Pacific States!"
acw_peace.4.e:0 "...the nativist Constitutional Republic!"

acw_peace.5.t:0 "All Quiet on the American Front"
acw_peace.5.d:0 "Much to the chagrin of our peacekeeping mission in America, it appears that the foolish American factional governments have begun preparing to renew their conflict. While not outright stating that they plan to relaunch the civil war, the practical radio silence towards our peacekeeping mission is all but confirmation of this. When pressed hard enough, they claim that they still need time to debate the merits of peaceful reunification, and that they only agreed to put down the Syndicalists, with the following phase of peace needing to be agreed to at a later date. With this, it is all but clear that a renewal of the Second American Civil War is around the corner. With this being the case, members of the peacekeeping mission have suggested we pressure the Americans to 'reconsider' the path they are taking. On the onset of the peace mission, we made it clear that should push come to shove, we would enforce peace on America no matter the cost, thus a few peacekeepers think we should make good on this promise. Of course, should they refuse to go along with this, we would need to follow through on our promises of violence, lest we lose all credibility on the international stage. Thus, many within the government itself think we should simply let the Americans ruin their nation further. After all, a potential conflict with America would be bloody, and that blood could be used elsewhere, such as in the rebuilding of Britain. Besides, the more America bleeds, the more she sinks into irrelevance, meaning that Canada can rise all the higher. Regardless, it is very likely that the American civil war will resume should not act, although the choice still remains to be made."

acw_peace.6.d:0 "It appears that Canada has not taken well to our efforts to restart the civil war. In no uncertain terms, Canada has threatened that should we refuse to allow their peace plan to go through, they would launch a full-scale invasion, and enforce peace by the sword. With such a clear and marked threat, our government has been put into a corner. Either we can continue our path to war, and face the wrath of one of the Great Powers, or we submit to their peace process, and possibly lose everything we have been fighting for. While most within the government have hastily reconsidered our course, many are adamant that we continue. There is no way Canada would actually invade us, or so they claim. They have just spent countless lives reclaiming Britain, thus they would never willingly spend even more lives to enforce a peace over us. Either way, Canada is expecting a response, and unless we want to test them even further, we must respond."

acw_peace.7.d:0 "In a somewhat shocking move, the Americans have foolishly elected to remain on their path to war. Decrying our attempts at enforcing peace, they have all but dared us to come down from the North and destroy their government. Most within the government believe that we simply must back our words with action. After all, if we don't act after we threaten war, why would any nation take us seriously in future should we threaten them with war? To this group, attacking and bringing peace is a matter of pride and national integrity. However, a section of the government believes that we simply should let America destroy itself. We have just fought long and hard to reclaim Britain, are we really prepared to condemn more of our boys to die in a foreign land? While they recognize that by not acting we would greatly endanger any future foreign policy, they view it as a fair deal for preserving the lives of our soldiers. With this spit in our face obviously requiring a decision, an emergency session of the cabinet has been called to find an appropriate response to this insult."

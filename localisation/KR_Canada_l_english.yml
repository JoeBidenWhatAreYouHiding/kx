### Leaders ###
POLITICS_GEORGE_DESC: "Born 3 June 1865, the second son to the future Edward VII, there was little expectation that George Windsor would become King and as such he was destined for a career in the navy. But following the death of his older brother to influenza in 1892, he was made Prince of Wales and heir apparent to the throne, ending his naval career. Having grown close during the shared period of mourning for his brother, George would marry Princess Mary of Teck, his brother's fiancé and so would begin a loving, if little publicly expressed relationship. But his world would once again be thrown into turmoil when in 1911 his father would die, and George was forced to ascend to the throne as King George V. George had taken power at a politically turbulent time with the rising temper of the Irish Home Rule movement and the Liberals' growing conflict with the lords. While the constitutional crisis would ultimately see the reform of the Lords and a civil war temporarily averted in Ireland, the world would be cast into the fires of war as the Great War broke out with a despondent George at the helm. Despite his attempts to appease British nationalism by abandoning his German titles and adopting the name Windsor, Britain's loss in the Weltkrieg caused the already growing republican movement to experience a steady uptick in support. After years of poor governance and politicking, the British Revolution would break out and amid his dithering refusal to intervene in the political crisis, the King would be forced to flee Britain into exile and watch his home, along with his Empire, tumble into the abbyss.\n\nThe King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has reigned over the British Empire, what's left of it, since his flight into exile. The loss of the Weltkrieg to his own cousin, the loss of his youngest son, John, and the final devastating loss of Britain itself have combined to break much of George V’s spirit despite his unending resolve to maintain his stature. With his health having worsened since the flight to Canada, which George privately refers to as “a frozen prison", he has gradually lost any interest in participating in domestic affairs, delegating such ceremonial duties as he may to his son, Prince Edward. He now lives on to spend what little time remains with his family and perhaps one day, the return to Britain, but this prospect grows dimmer by the day..."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC: "The first son of King George V, Edward VIII was born 23 June 1894 in the outskirts of London, named such after this late uncle. With a traditional childhood and tutoring, the young Prince was initially destined for a military schooling in the navy, first at Osborne and then Dartmouth. While a course of two years and entry into the navy was planned, this was cut short following his father's ascension to the throne. Preparations to prepare Edward for future leadership were started in earnest, being sent to Magdalen College at Oxford, despite allegations of being underprepared intellectually, ultimately leaving Oxford after eight terms, without any academic qualifications. By the time of the Great War, Edward was of legal age to join and enthusiastically signed into the Grenadier Guards but was refused deployment to the frontlines in case the heir apparent be captured or killed. Nevertheless, he would travel to the frontlines as often as he could and undertook military flights from 1918 onwards, making him deeply popular among veterans for his eagerness to fight alongside them. But Edward would return to a country that was disillusioned by its defeat and suffering from economic depression, a fact Edward note on during his many tours of poverty-stricken areas of Britain to meet with local people and take on board their concerns. But despite his efforts to reach out to the common populace, Edward would be evacuated with his family to Canada in 1925 amid the British Revolution despite his proposal that he return to the frontlines to fight the syndicalist menace.\n\nIn exile, the young Edward would gradually take on many of the duties his father once performed, becoming a regent in all but name. But following his father's death, Edward of Windsor was crownded in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa, with all the pomp and circumstance afforded to his forebearers. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward has already proven himself prone to meddling in politics with his own radical views and a man of lustful scandal on par with Oswald Mosley. But he maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom will one day proudly fly above the Home Isles and the Empire shall be restored to its glory..."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC: "Prince Albert of Windsor, younger Brother of British king Edward VIII, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Canadians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Canadian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With Edward occupied with the reconstruction of the recently reconquered Britain, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Canada is properly governed."
POLITICS_ALBERT_DESC: "Born in December of 1895, the young Prince Albert was not expected to be a king. Growing up in Britain, he was always in the shadow of his brother, Prince Edward. Albert I was always known as a timid and reserved man, until near the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, when he attended an academy in 1909 and became a sailor in 1913. Despite constant seasickness, he served in the Battle of Jutland aboard the HMS Collingwood, and later served as a squadron leader until being injured in November of 1918, remaining in Britain for the rest of the war.\n\nAfter the war, Albert continued to live in Britain until the revolution, fleeing to Canada. The Prince was relatively irrelevant up until the rise of his brother as King, being next in line for the throne. Upon his brother’s abdication, the new King Albert I is seen as an equal if not better than his predecessor, as he is more willing to work with the Canadian government and British Exiles. Although the king suffers from constant sickness, he is seen as a beacon of hope by the British Exiles. For better or for worse, Albert I will lead the charge into the Home Isles."

CAN_divided_nation: "Divided Nation"
CAN_divided_nation_desc: "The nation is split between the Conservatives and the British Exiles on one side, hoping to force Empire into preparing for a war in Europe, and Mackenzie King's Liberals on the other, putting Canada's sovereignty first and unwilling to commit the country to a disastrous war. It is hoped that the coming election will decide the issue once and for all."
CAN_anglo_french_tensions_1: "Anglo-French Tensions"
CAN_anglo_french_tensions_1_desc: "Most of Canada's French population is located in the eastern province of Québec, and the traditional distrust between the Québecois and English Canadians has heated up with recent talk of pushing the country towards war. Of all Canadians, the Québecois are the most ardently opposed to conscription and the idea of wasting their lives on a far-away war for a sovereign they feel isn't their own."

CAN_great_depression_1: "The Great Depression"
CAN_great_depression_1_desc: "Our recovery from the Great Depression was going well until Black Monday hit our shores. Thankfully, the Canadian economy isn't nearly as tied to German markets as some, and economists say it won't be long before we recover from this extra hurdle that's now been placed in our path."
CAN_great_depression_2: "The Great Depression"
CAN_great_depression_2_desc: "While Canada has been far quicker to recover from the Depression than their American cousins to the south, their economy is in many ways tied to southern trade and thus they will never be fully recovered until the Americans are. Still, things have been rapidly improving, and economists say a complete recovery is just around the corner."

Where mass conscripted Germans and Syndicalist militias flee against a few volleys of gunfire, we stand against the fires of Hell with a stiff upper lip."

CAN_work_camps_desc: "Call them labour camps if you wish, but these camps exist to provide unemployed men a job, a place to live, and food to eat.

CAN_aircanada_idea: "Trans-Canada Airlines"
CAN_aircanada_idea_desc: "Founding a national airline company capable of linking the entirety of Canada by air is no small task. But as a simple airfield is all you need to link two cities together, this allows us to bypass the need for titanic infrastructure works. The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."
CAN_air_training_plan_idea: "Entente Air Training Plan"
CAN_air_training_plan_idea_desc: "Air training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for. By making sure the right concepts and techniques are taught from the get-go, we ensure that the pilots who are later put at the helm of our planes out-perform their peers. Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."

CAN_invasion_plans_2: "Invasion Focus"
CAN_invasion_plans_2_desc: "We have contacted the resistance in the Union of Britain, giving us a network of information on their operations that nobody else would be able to acquire.

CAN_war_of_1812_idea: "The Looming War"
CAN_war_of_1812_idea_desc: "The prospect of an intervention in the American Civil War has the entire nation terrified. If it happens, it means that battles will be fought on Canadian soil for the first time in over a century, against an opponent that could very well overwhelm us with sheer numbers. We must be ready."

CAN_refugee_crisis_sec: "American Refugees Under Guard"
CAN_refugee_crisis_sec_desc: "It means bolstering the numbers in provincial police forces, men who could otherwise be soldiers, but this will keep the camps under close guard and prevent further problems."
CAN_refugee_crisis_help: "American Refugees Aided"
CAN_refugee_crisis_help_desc: "The camps will always be a source of problems for us, but we've gone out of our way to ensure the refugees are treated and fed well. Hopefully the war will be over soon."
CAN_refugee_crisis_sam: "Project Samaritan"

CAN_emergency_draft: "Enact Emergency Draft"
CAN_emergency_draft_desc: "There are a number of British Exiles present in Canada who either are too old to serve in the military or unwilling. The old guard can serve as mentors to the new, and the unwilling should serve to fight for their homeland whether they wish to or not. The time has come to call them to service."
CAN_expand_conscription_policies: "Expand Conscription Policies"
CAN_expand_conscription_policies_desc: "We needn't worry about arguments from the opposition, now - it's time to loosen up our policies on conscription, so we get more able bodies out in the field and we do so faster. Let's cut through the red tape and simply get it done!"

CAN_claim_alaska_desc: "The border between Canada and Alaska was made in the favor of Americans, thanks to an interest by the British government of the time in improving relations with the United States. Canadian interests were considered of secondary importance. Since the treaty was approved by a government we are no longer subservient to, we reject the arbitration and the border. Canada has a natural claim to Alaska, and it should have been ours to begin with."
CAN_core_alaska: "Alaska is Canadian Land"

CAN_privy_council: "Status of the Privy Council"
CAN_privy_council_desc: "The British government-in-exile has acted on emergency powers since the country's downfall, wielding power only through its status as the king's Privy Council. It's been over a decade, however, and there are many who feel that the time has come for a change."
CAN_imperial_conference: "The Imperial Conference"
CAN_imperial_conference_desc: "There has not been a gathering of the Dominions since the fall of the Home Isles, but it's been decided that now is the time - even if Canada is at the head of the table, instead of the United Kingdom.

CAN_draft_bill_c7_desc: "With the election finally over, it is time for the government to concentrate on Bill C-7 - which will determine the country's approach to conscription, the military industry, and our national security. The debate will begin the moment it's introduced in the House of Commons, and will consume the government's attention until it is complete."

CAN_quebec_in_flames: "Québec in Flames"
CAN_quebec_in_flames_desc: "The patience of the Québecois with English Canada has finally hit a boiling point. Across the eastern province, demonstrations and even riots have broken down the fabric of social order... at a time when Canada can least afford it. Somehow, things must be set right."
CAN_montreal_conference: "The Montréal Conference"

CAN_official_bilingualism: "Official Bilingualism"
CAN_official_bilingualism_desc: "French has always been present in Canada as a second language, but the first and biggest demand of the Québecois is that it be made an official language - as important as English at every governmental level across the nation, and protected within the province of Québec itself."
CAN_new_quebec_status: "New Status for Québec"
CAN_new_quebec_status_desc: "To resolve the situation in Québec, we must amend their status within Confederation.

CAN_surete_du_quebec_desc: "The time has come to rebuild the provincial police force in Québec, to make sure that it is capable of maintaining order and that it has full power to maintain surveillance over the French population. Once Québec and Canada are both at peace, perhaps we can begin to talk about French grievances."
CAN_war_measures_act: "Invoke the War Measures Act"
CAN_war_measures_act_desc: "The idea behind the War Measures Act is simple: in a time of war, the federal government has the right to suspend the rights of Canadian citizens.

CAN_purge_the_opposition: "Control the House of Commons"

CAN_cp_rail_expansion_desc: "It was only the promise of a trans-continental rail network that brought the western provinces into the Dominion.

CAN_invest_resources: "Invest in Natural Resources"

CAN_explore_the_north: "Explore the North"

CAN_public_works: "Open Federal Relief Camps"
CAN_public_works_desc: "The Great Depression has not released its hold upon us yet - we still have hordes of unemployed men across the country, living in poverty or turning to crime.

This would help bring together a divided nation, and limit the influence of potentially subversive foreign broadcasts."
CAN_electronics_training: "Electronics Training Initiative"
CAN_electronics_training_desc: "We should take it upon ourselves to train a cadre of experts to man and maintain radios, RADAR and other modern electronic weapons of war. The RADAR is no simple technology, and we will need competent engineers and field operators to ensure our stations work at maximal efficiency, especially as we build more."
CAN_university_of_ottawa: "University of Ottawa"
CAN_university_of_ottawa_desc: "The University of Ottawa is one of Canada's oldest insitutions of learning, and it is the facility that grew the most when the brightest minds from the United Kingdom fled to the country. That gathering of intelligentsia is something we should take advantage of with increased funding on government-approved projects."

CAN_naval_bomber_programme: "Naval Bomber Programme"
CAN_naval_bomber_programme_desc: "The FAA was founded soon after the Great War as the aviation arm of the Royal Navy, and its officers advocate for a new theory of naval warfare built around the aircraft carrier as the primary weapon of the fleet. Naval Bombers can threaten any fleet, and planes are starting to become a fearsome weapon of war."
CAN_new_officers: "New Naval Officers"

### Events ###
canada.1.t: "The Current Situation"
canada.1.d: "It has been ten years since the collapse of the United Kingdom in 1926 and, in that time, the king, the remnants of the British government, and over a million of the Empire's best and brightest (and wealthiest) have fled to Canada... with the clear expectation that an invasion would soon be launched to take back the Home Isles from the syndicalist upstarts. It quickly became evident, however, that the syndicalist position was stronger than anticipated. Early forays were rebuked, and the last decade has seen the Union of Britain become solidified and entrenched, to the point where we have had to adopt the Blue Ensign as the Red Ensign was too similar to the Unions. The Exiles, as they're called in Canada, have meanwhile been left adrift, determined to take back their homeland but facing the political reality that this may never happen."
canada.1.a: "One day soon, though!"
canada.2.d: "While initially welcomed with open arms by Canadians, the notion this might be a long-term arrangement has been an increasingly unpleasant one. Fingers were pointed and blame laid on those who were deemed responsible for the collapse and the subsequent inability to rectify matters, and resentment against Exiles who were seen as 'a higher class' in the Dominion as well as above the law has been growing. In 1931, a year after their election, the minority government of R.B. Bennett and his Conservatives collapsed, to be replaced by Mackenzie King and the Liberals with a promised focus on Canadian sovereignty and keeping the British government-in-exile at arm's length rather than acting as if nothing had changed in the relationship."
canada.2.a: "Only to be expected"
canada.3.d: "This year, Mackenzie King and the Liberals are nearing the end of their term and, on top of the tribulations of the Great Depression, there is growing criticism that little progress has been made in resolving the political situation. George V lies on his deathbed, charging the Exiles and the Conservatives with bringing the Empire 'back on track'. His government clashes often with the Liberals, and the Canadian public appears split between those who would see matters come to a head and those who would prefer to abandon their ties to the crown and the French exiles in Africa both. The upcoming election appears as if it will be the most divisive in Canadian history."
canada.3.a: "Goodness!"
canada.4.t: "Death of King George V"
canada.4.d: "In the last several months, King George has been plagued by illness and his health has been failing. This fact has been kept from the public, to keep up appearances while treatments were attempted, but it seems all was for naught. At 11.55 p.m. yesterday, the king died following a bout of severe fever. His eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Edward, has inherited the throne as Edward VIII and is expected to address the nation within the month. An official coronation will take place in several month's time, after an official mourning period for King George has been observed."
canada.4.a: "The Empire enters a state of mourning..."
canada.5.t: "The Coronation of King Edward"
canada.5.d: "King Edward VIII is the first British monarch not to be coronated within the halls of Westminster Abbey. Instead, royal planners held an elaborate ceremony in Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa's largest Anglican church. There the Archbishop of Canterbury, himself a British exile, performed the rites as expected by tradition, with a throng of media paying close attention to every move. Rather than making his first public appearance afterwards on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, King Edward instead appeared on the balcony of Rideau Hall, the official royal residence, where he was greeted by a throng of entusiastic Canadians."
canada.5.a: "It's official!"
canada.6.t: "The King's First Address"
canada.6.d: "As King Edward prepares his first radio address to the Empire, he must consider what his message will be. His Privy Council is, of course, urging him to promote the cause of retaking the Home Isles. R.B. Bennett, the leader of the Conservative Party and the Official Opposition, suggests that he use his platform to endorse them for the upcoming election, saying that will serve the cause of war far better. Others, meanwhile, suggest that supporting the current Prime Minister and government will go a long way to mending fences and maintaining stability... though it could also be seen as a tacit endorsement of the Liberal Party's position."
canada.6.a: "He will prepare the nation for war"
canada.6.b: "He will endorse the Conservatives"

canada.7.d.war: "In his radio address, the king has spoken to the nation and has electrified it. From Vancouver to St. John, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech denouncing syndicalism and the king's pledge to finish the war that his father began and finally reclaim Britain. His message was received as a tacit endorsement of the British Exiles in Canada, and a clear call to begin preparations for war... despite the current Liberal government's more tentative policy on the matter."
canada.7.d.cons: "In his radio address, the king has spoken to the nation and has electrified it. From Vancouver to St. John, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech celebrating Canadian democracy. In it, King Edward specifically called out the long service of R.B. Bennett and the Conservative Party, and suggested Canadians - and indeed the entire Entente - would be well-served to have them leading the country into the next war. Bennett, in turn, publicly thanked the king and called on all his fellow Canadians to look on this as the turning a new page and a chance to follow a young and vital king to victory at last."
canada.7.d.gov: "In his radio address, the King has spoken to the nation and has electrified it. From Vancouver to St. John, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech celebrating Canadian progress and potential. In it, King Edward unexpectedly complimented Prime Minister Mackenzie King and the work of his government, and told Canadians that now, more than ever, they needed to band together in their common cause against the enemies that would threaten them all."
canada.7.a: "We must liberate our brothers in Britain!"
canada.7.b: "This election will be vital for our future!"
canada.7.c: "The 20th century shall be Canada's Century!"
canada.8.t: "Status of the Privy Council"
canada.8.d: "The British government-in-exile has operated on emergency powers for the last ten years, existing without elections and unable to exercise legal influence outside of their status as the king's Privy Council. Recently, however, there have been indications that Prime Minister Austen Chamberlain's time is up. Many Exiles see him as partly responsible for the loss of the Home Isles, and have been urging King Edward to replace him. We could push the king to appoint a more moderate candidate, however - someone more likely to work with the Canadian government. We could also urge the king to call for an election among the Exiles in Canada, though how much of a legal mandate that would give the new Prime Minister is questionable. Still, it's more democratic than an appointee."
canada.8.a: "Let the king pick Chamberlain's replacement"
canada.8.b: "We should push for a moderate candidate"
canada.8.c: "A vote by the Exiles should be organized"
canada.9.t: "Fate of the Senate"
canada.9.d: "Since the arrival of the Exiles to Canada, King George V appointed many of their numbers to the Canadian Senate - mainly as rewards for 'valiant service to the defense of the Empire'. Since King Edward's ascension, the appointments of Exiles has continued... to the point where the Senate is often referred to as 'the Canadian House of Lords'. Many members of the government are saying the time has come to insist on Senate Reform, passing a law requiring Senatorial appointments be confirmed by the House of Commons. Considering the Senate has the power to reject bills, this could result in a showdown with the king... unless he decides that it is better not to anger the government of his host country while in exile."
canada.9.a: "We need reform at once!"
canada.9.b: "Urge the king to appoint more Canadians"
canada.9.c: "It's the king's prerogative to choose as he wishes"
canada.10.t: "Senate Reform Bill Vetoed"
canada.10.d: "Urged by King [CAN_king_first_name] to do so, the Senate has vetoed the reform bill sent to them by the House of Commons, thus starting a showdown of words as the two houses argue over the bill's wording and implementation. The king's stance appears to be that 'in these troubling times' he cannot relinquish his royal prerogatives... so that likely means no reform will be possible. The king's actions have not endeared him with the Canadian public, however, as newspapers across the country have painted the king's actions as contemptuous of Canadian sovereignty and democracy."
canada.10.a: "Well, we tried"
canada.11.t: "Senate Reform Bill Passes"
canada.11.d: "The Senate has begrudgingly passed the reform bill sent to them by the House of Commons, with King [CAN_king_first_name] reportedly having no comment on the matter. It is clear that Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the British Exiles in Canada, advised the king that a confrontation with the Canadian government at this time would prove imprudent. The first vote in the House of Commons on the next Senate appointee is due within weeks, and the entire country is eagerly anticipating the first Canadian-born appointee in over a decade."
canada.11.a: "Excellent"
canada.12.t: "Chief of the RCN"
canada.12.d: "A heated discussion has occurred within the Canadian government regarding who to formally appoint as the head of the RCN. Until now, the British fleet-in-exile has operated more or less independently of the Canadian chain of command, but everyone agrees this cannot continue. The British Exiles are adamant on putting Sir Roger Backhouse in the fleet, since they say it IS their fleet. Ministers suggest Canadian admiral Percy Nelles is more the man for the job, and will do a better job of co-ordinating the two forces."
canada.12.a: "Nelles should have the job"
canada.12.b: "Sir Backhouse will look after the British fleet best"
canada.13.t: "Chief of the Army"
canada.13.d: "The time has come to select the man who will lead both the British and Canadian forces to victory on the ground. King [CAN_king_first_name] and Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] have all but anointed J.F.C. 'Boney' Fuller with the title, convinced his ideas on mechanizing the military is exactly the kind of ideas we need. They both seem to have forgotten, however, that the majority of lives on the line will be Canadian. Several miniters have pointed out that Georges Vanier is more than qualified, and will keep the British from throwing away Canadian lives in another Gallipoli."
canada.13.a: "Georges Vanier is the Canadian we need"
canada.13.b: "'Boney' Fuller is the man for the job"
canada.14.t: "The Chief of Staff"
canada.14.d: "With the war against the syndicalists now upon us, King [CAN_king_first_name] is pressuring the Prime Minister to make a choice as to who will lead the Canadian forces overall. We must choose wisely. The British commanders are skilled, and will pelase the king as he wants to see one of his own in charge of the invasion. The Canadian commanders, however, will be far more popular back home."
canada.14.a: "Ironside is still our man for the job!"
canada.14.b: "Montgomery-Massingberd will get us to London!"
canada.14.c: "Harry Crerar is our new commander!"
canada.14.e: "Kenneth Stuart is the man for Canada!"
canada.20.t: "The [GetYear] Stanley Cup"
canada.20.d: "Two teams have made it into the [GetYear] Stanley Cup Finals: the Toronto Maple Leafs, making their sixth appearance, and the Detroit Red Wings, making their second appearance and still hungry to win their first cup. With only a brief interruption at the first game in Detroit, with demonstrators by the Socialist Party of America disrupting proceedings outside the stadium, the series has gone off without a hitch and captivated audiences in both countries. Who will take home the cup this year?"
canada.20.a: "Come on, Toronto!"
canada.20.b: "Come on, Detroit!"
canada.21.t: "Detroit Wins the Stanley Cup"
canada.21.d: "The Detroit Red Wings have swept the Toronto Maple Leafs for the Stanley Cup, giving the Red Wings the Stanley Cup for the first time. The games were held during a time of great unrest but, for a day, the people weren't rioting over political differences, they were rioting over the championship."
canada.21.a: "A worthy effort, Toronto"
canada.21.b: "Stanley is back in Hockeytown! Woo Hoo!"
canada.22.t: "Toronto Wins the Stanley Cup"
canada.22.d: "Toronto has vanquished Detroit in a four-game series for the Stanley Cup, bringing the Canadian team their fourth victory in the finals. Once again, the Kid Line of Charlie Conacher, Harvey 'Busher' Jackson, and Joe Primeau has brought the Stanley Cup to Toronto!"
canada.22.a: "O Canada! Our home and native land!"
canada.22.b: "We'll win next year!"
canada.23.t: "Black Monday hits Canada"
canada.23.d: "Just when we thought we were almost through the doldrums of the Great Depression, the German economic markets have experienced a massive crash which has come to be dubbed 'Black Monday'. While the Canadian economy isn't as tied to the German markets as some, the ripples have been felt throughout the world... particularly in the United States, a market we are particularly dependent upon. This setback is difficult to take, though Prime Minister King has assured the country, 'We will make it through this, just as we have the dark years prior! Now is the time for us to join together and work as we never have before!'"
canada.23.a: "More troubles? Bah!"
canada.24.t: "Writ of Election Issued"
canada.24.d: "The House of Commons has issued the writ of election, calling for general elections to be held in October of this year. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have already begun campaigning, and the general sentiment is that this election will be an important one - does the country push hard towards a confrontation with the Union of Britain, or does it take a more cautious approach and focus on building up Canada's strength and that of the other Dominions? The Liberals favor the latter, while the Conservatives and the British Exiles heavily favor the former."
canada.24.a: "May the best party win!"
canada.25.t: "Bennett Accuses Liberals of Inaction"
canada.25.d: "With the effects of Black Monday still being felt in Canada, R.B. Bennett has taken the offensive and accused Mackenzie King and the Liberals of gross inaction - not only on the economic management of the country, but on what he suggests is an 'inevitable war that will determine the fate not only of Canada but the entire world'. Canada, he says, should be pushing hard for the coming war, and suggests that if it fails to do so 'the Entente shall be caught once again in a weak and indefensible position'. Considering the large crowd he attracted at his latest speech in Halifax, there are a large number of Canadians who agree with him."
canada.25.a: "Is that so?"
canada.26.t: "CCF Appeals to the Unemployed"
canada.26.d: "The recently-formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party, led by J.S. Woodsworth, has been making large gains in the polls as Woodsworth speaks to groups of unemployed labourers and factory workers across the country. The party's democratic socialist platform has resulted in accusations of it being funded and run by syndicalist sympathizers, but its message of alleviating the suffering of farmers and workers under capitalism has hit a chord even so. Regardless, its popularity seems most concentrated in Western Canada, and the idea it might have a chance at forming a government is remote."
canada.26.a: "Democratic socialism? In the True North?"
canada.27.t: "The Conscription Debate Begins"
canada.27.d: "As expected, the most contentious issue in the election is proving to be that of conscription. Both the Liberals and Conservatives have proposed a bill that has become known as C-7, which would shape our preparations for war over the coming years. Whether Bill C-7 includes conscription, however, is the key element. French-Canadians in Québec are, in particular, vehemently opposed to the idea of general conscription forcing them to fight in a 'British war', and thus Liberal promises of not implementing it have seen them make great gains in that province. Conservatives, meanwhile, say that Canada doesn't have the manpower to fight any war without conscription. The war, when it comes, means conscription sooner or later - and they say, for all our sakes, it should be sooner."
canada.27.a: "This could get ugly"
canada.28.t: "Demonstration at King Speech"
canada.28.d: "A campaign stop by Mackenzie King in Toronto was marred today when it was met by a large demonstration organized by the Orange Order of Canada. The Order, which celebrates Canadian ties with the British Empire and has been capaigning strenuously for greater action against the Union of Britain, has declared the Liberal 'no conscription' position as an outrage that threatens the very survival of the Empire. The raucous chanting and shouting prevented King from continuing the speech, and altercations between Liberal supporters and the Orange Order almost ended up in a riot before the police were finally called in to intervene."
canada.28.a: "They shouldn't have been there"
canada.28.b: "They were unfairly provoked"
canada.29.t: "Duplessis Wins Québec Election"
canada.29.d: "Coming off a campaign based on Québecois dissatisfaction with the economic downturn and the threat of national conscription, Maurice Duplessis and the Union Nationale have won a majority government in the Québec provincial elections. Duplessis has sworn to fight any plan to enact conscription, and there are even threats of calling for a referendum on the future of Québec in Confederation should that happen. This is a clear sign of just how serious the divisions between English Canadians and French Canadians have become, now that the split of opinion on Canada's role in the coming war is so sharp."
canada.29.a: "This is not good"
canada.30.t: "March Against Conscription"
canada.30.d: "A giant march against Bill C-7 and the prospect of national conscription has taken place in both Montreal and Québec City, with smaller marches taking place in Ottawa and Vancouver. Opposition to conscription is beginning to hit a head, with many of the signs in the marches declaring 'Exiles Get Out!' and 'No War For Canada!' in either English or French. Members of the Conservative party have openly suggested the marches are being organized by the Union of Britain in order to destabilize the Entente, but Mackenzie King and the Liberals have treated them seriously and doubled-down on the party's opposition to widespread conscription."
canada.30.a: "Goodness!"
canada.31.t: "Bennett Assaults Reporter"
canada.31.d: "At a campaign stop in Hamilton, R.B. Bennett was aggressively questioned by a French-Canadian reporter over the Conservative plans for conscription, outright implying that the Conservatives intended to send French Canadians into the front lines in order to eliminate their 'threat to Anglophone domination'. Unsurprisingly, the tempestuous Bennett's response was to attack the man, causing a near-riot that dominated the newspapers for days."
canada.31.a: "He's willing to fight, and that's a good thing!"
canada.31.b: "Bennett is an embarrassment"
canada.32.t: "Rise of the Nationalist Party"
canada.32.d: "The main competition for the Liberals among those opposed to conscription appears to have become the Nationalist Party of Canada, led by Henry Herbert Stevens. The Nationalist Party's platform began as republican and anti-monarchist, but has evolved into a stance which would see Canada pulled out of the Entente entirely. Stevens is expected to win in his British Columbia riding, but so far has been unable to gain traction in Québec where the party could do more than eat at the Liberal domination there."
canada.32.a: "Interesting"
canada.33.t: "King Edward Comments on War"
canada.33.d: "King Edward recently made the rounds in Canadian newspapers, commenting on the war with [war_country.GetNameDef] and saying, 'This won't be the end of it. The world order established after the end of the Great War is now falling apart, and the Empire must be ready. We cannot put our heads in the ground and wish things were other than they are, for one way or another the wars overseas will come to our shores.' The king's comments were seen as tacit support for R.B. Bennett and the Conservatives, and many Canadians are reluctantly agreeing."
canada.33.a: "I see"
canada.34.t: "Complaints over Labour Camp Conditions"
canada.34.d: "The economic relief camps set up by the government have been the source of considerable criticism as of late, mainly due to the low rate of pay received by the workers as well as their living conditions. The unemployed men working in the camps say that they cannot earn enough money to return to their former lives and get regular jobs, forcing them to remain in the camps indefinitely. Anger has been rising, and there are demands for the government to do something about it."
canada.34.a: "It's time to shut down the camps"
canada.34.b: "Improve the camp conditions"
canada.34.c: "These men should be grateful they have work at all!"
canada.35.t: "The March on Ottawa"
canada.35.d: "Complaints over the pay and conditions at Canada's economic relief camps has continued. Now, the camp workers have organized a 'March on Ottawa', with many of them reaching the capital by jumping on top of trains! The large group assembled and demanded to speak to the Minister of Labour and the Prime Minister, presenting a list of demands. Public sympathy for the workers has been high, with many newspapers publishing photos of the deplorable camp conditions they work in."
canada.35.a: "Fine, fine, we'll shut down the camps"
canada.35.b: "We'll improve conditions at the camps"
canada.36.t: "Unemployment Insurance Proposed"
canada.36.d.camps: "With complaints continuing over conditions at the labour camps, a new law has been proposed by CCF members within the House of Commons: namely that unemployment 'insurance' would replace the relief camps entirely. Workers and employers would pay into the system, and the unemployed would draw from the insurance to tide them over until a new job was found. It's an expensive solution, but one that has drawn considerable praise and support."
canada.36.d.nocamps: "The labour camps have been shut down, but the essential problem of the unemployed remains... and now a new law has been proposed by CCF members within the House of Commons: namely that unemployment 'insurance' would replace the need for the camps entirely. Workers and employers would pay into the system, and the unemployed would draw from the insurance to tide them over until a new job was found. It's an expensive solution, but one that has drawn considerable praise and support."
canada.36.a: "Pass the law"
canada.36.b: "Just get rid of the camps"
canada.36.c: "We are fine with the system the way it is"
canada.37.t: "Anti-Syndicalism on the Imperial Broadcasting Service"
canada.37.d: "The Imperial Broadcasting Service was founded by Sir John Reith in 1926 after the British Revolution when his previous broadcasting organisation, the British Broadcasting Corporation, was taken over by the syndicalists. The service proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire, and also as a tool to marginalise syndicalism within our borders. There have been calls to install Reith as the head of the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in order to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists in the country. Others have suggested using Reith to employ propaganda with a more external focus, to prepare our people for the coming fight against syndicalism."
canada.37.a: "The CBC is fine as it is"
canada.37.b: "Put Reith in charge of the CBC"
canada.37.c: "Put Reith in charge, so long as he focuses attention on our foes abroad"
canada.38.t: "Billy Bishop Criticises Priorities"
canada.38.d: "Billy Bishop, our Air Marshal and a long-standing air force hero, has criticized the government's military spending priorities. The coming war, he says, will be decided in the air... and if [Root.GetNameDef] is to be ready for it, that will mean more money and manpower be spent on modernising the air force. He has a detailed plan, and it seems like it could work, but this will take resources from other projects."
canada.38.a: "Bishop is a good man and I trust his methods"
canada.38.b: "The air force will get no more of a priority"
canada.39.t: "Naval Exercises in the Atlantic"
canada.39.d: "With the international situation deteriorating, it is imperative we demonstrate our strength and exercise our right to free passage in the Atlantic. To this end, the Admiralty have scheduled an extensive array of fleet manoeuvres and war-games in the North Atlantic. We can play it safe, but the Admiralty seems to believe we could also challenge a navy of roughly equal measure to a bit of a game... if they're up for the challenge. Doing so would be risky, but the experience for our navy would be much greater."
canada.39.a: "Conduct a large exercise off the coast of Britain and Ireland"
canada.39.b: "Conduct a large exercise in the North Sea"
canada.39.c: "Conduct a large exercise off the American Coast"
canada.39.e: "Conduct normal exercises in Canadian territorial waters"
canada.40.t: "A Challenge from the Canadian Navy?"
canada.40.d: "A large flotilla of ships ranging dangerously close to our territorial waters has been identified as Canadian. We can't be certain, but they appear to be testing our responses... challenging us, in other words. We could send out our fleet to rattle our sabres in a game of manoeuvres, but we are taken a bit by surprise. If we lose, it will be embarassing for us, though perhaps not as much if we don't act at all."
canada.40.a: "They want to play? We'll play!"
canada.40.b: "Ignore them - they're just Canadians"
canada.41.t: "Naval Manoeuvres Lost"
canada.41.can: "We challenged the [From.GetAdjective] navy... and it seems we lost. They ran circles around us, and made our experienced captains look like fools until we were forced to retreat."
canada.41.oth: "We challenged the Canadian navy... and we lost. They were prepared for us to show ourselves, and then playing a game of hide-and-seek in the waters while they made us look like fools."
canada.41.a: "How embarrassing"
canada.42.t: "Naval Manoeuvres Won"
canada.42.can: "We challenged the [From.GetAdjective] navy... and won the day, naturally. Our experienced captains ran circles around the [From.GetAdjective] ships and made them look like fools."
canada.42.oth: "We challenged the Canadian ships... and, despite their preparation, we won the day. Our more experienced captains ran circles around their fleet and sent them limping back to their own waters, like fools."
canada.42.a: "Hurrah!"
canada.42.b: "What, not even an 'I'm sorry'?"
canada.50.t: "Federal Election of [GetYear]"
canada.50.d: "The moment has come, with the country heading to the polls to decide between the Liberals under William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Conservatives under R.B. Bennett. Either way, it is certain the election will be close, and should there be a prospect of a minority government it seems likely the role of kingmaker would be given to the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, who have already declared they would support a Liberal government if it came down to that."

With the Conservative party's slim hold on power, passing the bill might prove challenging... and with a defeated bill comes a fallen government, so passing the bill is of extreme importance. Prime Minister Bennett might have to consider compromising with the Loyal Opposition, though not so much that he angers his own allies."

canada.53.t: "Bill C-7: National Conscription"
canada.53.d: "Perhaps the most important issue covered by the bill is that of conscription. The Conservative government has avowed that it intends to employ extensive conscription across the country. There are those in the party, however, who have expressed grave concern over the reaction from French Canadians, and have suggested that a more limited form of conscription - while still objectionable to the French - would at least not stir up violence and might actually get some support from the Liberals on the bill."

canada.53.b: "Perhaps a more limited conscription would be better"
canada.54.t: "Bill C-7: National Conscription"
canada.54.d: "Perhaps the most important issue covered by the bill is that of conscription. The Liberal government has promised French Canadians that it will not enact conscription at all, but there are those within the party who agree with the Conservatives in that Canada's manpower reserves are already dismally low. Changing our minds might get some agreement from the Conservatives on the bill... though it would almost certainly come at the cost of accusations of betrayal and perhaps even some defections from the Liberal side of the House of Commons."

The party is in coalition with the Liberal government, and has vowed to oppose the bill when it comes to a vote.

canada.56.t: "Bill C-7: the Future of Canada's Industry"
canada.56.d: "Recovery from the Great Depression has left Canada's industry in a deplorable state, and the government insists that the nation needs to industrialize at an incredibly rapid rate if it hopes to challenge the Union of Britain's power. The Liberal plan, put forward by C.D. Howe, suggests that Canada should focus on funding urban infrastructure and the civilian economy - those, combined with incentives, should bring the needed military investment in the long run. The Conservative plan is to nationalize the needed armament and naval industries now, and build them up with government funding even if the rest of Canada's industrial base lags behind."

canada.57.d: "Canada has been able to avoid the bitter class war that engulfed Britain after the Great War, but conflict between Canadians and the British Exiles is growing, as has syndicalist sentiment among Canada's labour unions. Both the Conservatives and the Liberals have suggested the RCMP be granted sweeping powers to crack down on dissidents, with a minister to act as chairman on a Parliamentary committee to oversee the process. The Conservatives have proposed Maxwell Knight, renowned hardliner and British Exile, be that chairman. The Liberals, meanwhile, have said that Ernest Lapointe would do a better job. He may be more moderate in his views, but as an MP from Québec he is far more in tune with French Canadians."

Manion is said to be a part of the king's inner circle, and assumes the position with the hopes he will reinvigorate the party for the upcoming election."
canada.63.d: "With their loss in the last election, it is no surprise that the Conservative Party has turned to new leadership. With the blessing of King [CAN_king_first_name], Ontario MP Robert Manion has stepped up and taken the leadership reins of the party from R.B. Bennett."
canada.63.a: "Let's see if this improves their standing"
canada.64.t: "The American Civil War"
canada.64.d: "King [CAN_king_first_name] has commented on the outbreak of the civil war in America, saying 'It is clear that the ability for one of the mightiest nations on Earth to fall to syndicalism should come as a wake up call to all Canadians and indeed the entire Empire. The loss of Britain and France was not a chance occurrence, but rather the onset of a wave of tyranny which will sweep the whole world into its wake if we do not stand against it with all our might.'"
canada.64.a: "We're trying, your Majesty!"
canada.65.t: "Mackenzie King Promises New Deal"
canada.65.d.lib: "Still smarting from his government's failure to pass Bill C-7, Prime Minister Mackenzie King promised Canadians that their revised version would be a 'new deal' for Canadians across the country. He affirmed that the new bill would have no conscription, no special powers for the RCMP, and stick closely to the Liberal incentive plan for the economy. 'No matter the war that faces us,' he told a crowd in Montreal, 'if Canada is not a free and independent nation then it has already lost.'"
canada.65.d.cons: "Taking advantage of the loss in Conservative popularity following their failure to pass Bill C-7, Prime Minister Mackenzie King promised that the Liberal bill would be a 'new deal' for Canadians across the country. He affirmed that the new bill would have no conscription, no special powers for the RCMP, and stick closely to the Liberal incentive plan for the economy. 'No matter the war that faces us,' he told a crowd in Montreal, 'if Canada is not a free and independent nation then it has already lost.'"

canada.66.t: "Manion Outlines Bill C-8"
canada.66.d.cons: "Robert Manion was quick to explain to a crowd of supporters in Toronto that Bill C-8, his replacement for the failed Bill C-7, was precisely what Canada needed - now more than ever. The new bill would enact full conscription, nationalize the country's major arms industries, and set up an RCMP that would 'keep the peace at home'. 'Canada needs to be at the forefront of our alliance, stronger than it ever has been before, and I know that we can do it. Working arm in arm with our British friends and cousins, we can match the syndicalists pound for pound!'"

canada.67.t: "The Run-off Federal Election"
canada.67.d: "For the second time, Canadians head to the polls to elect a new government. While there are some fears that the new government will only win a minority of seats, most analysts appear certain that one of the two major parties is likely to come out big - either the government will have its mandate reinforced, or the opposition will come on strong riding on a wave of protest."
canada.67.a: "The Liberals win a majority"
canada.67.b: "The Conservatives win a majority"
canada.68.t: "Liberals Pass 'New Deal' Bill C-7"
canada.68.d: "With a minimum of debate in the House of Commons, the majority Liberals under Mackenzie King pushed through a revised Bill C-7 - their 'New Deal', as Mackenzie King referred to it during the campaign. As promised, it contains no provisions for conscription or a secret police, and adheres closely to C.D. Howe's original plan for economic subsidization. King [CAN_king_first_name] advised the Canadian Senate to pass the bill without fuss, as delaying the government's ability to function further would be 'unfortunate for us all'."
canada.68.a: "It's about time!"
canada.69.t: "Conservatives Pass Bill C-8"
canada.69.d: "With a minimum of debate in the House of Commons, the majority Conservatives pushed through their revised Bill C-8. As promised, it contains provisions for full conscription, an empowered secret police under Maxwell Knight, and the nationalization of major armament and naval companies. King [CAN_king_first_name] advised the Canadian Senate to pass the bill without fuss, as delaying the government's ability to function further would be 'unfortunate for us all'."
canada.69.a: "It's about time!"
canada.70.t: "Mackenzie King Retires"
canada.70.d: "Sir William Lyon Mackenzie King has retired, having led the Liberal Party of Canada since 1919. He first became Prime Minister in 1925, and was heard to say, 'it is time for me to move on.' Louis St. Laurent will replace him as the leader of the party, signalling a definite shift in power towards the more progressive wing of the Liberals."
canada.70.a: "Let's hope that he enjoys retirement, eh?"

canada.72.t: "Woodsworth Loses CCF Leadership Vote"
canada.72.d: "J.S. Woodsworth, who has led the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation since its founding in 1932, lost his leadership over the party - due in large part, it's said, to his increasingly unpopular opposition to war against the syndicalists. He has been replaced by the younger James Coldwell, who has promised to re-invigorate the party and restore it to prominence."

canada.76.t: "Conservative Party Rebranded"
canada.76.d: "With their loss in the last election, the Conservatives are left with the feeling that their party is at a low ebb. After gathering the party faithful at their annual convention, they have decided to elect Manitoba Premier John Bracken as their new leader - but he has agreed only to rejoin the party and serve if the party changes their name to the Progressive Conservatives. This rebranding, it is thought, might make the party more palatable to voters in Quebec, to whom the Conservatives have traditionally had trouble appealing."
canada.76.a: "Good luck with that"
canada.77.t: "King [CAN_king_first_name] Replaces British PM"
canada.77.d: "Several recent conflicts between British Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] and King [CAN_king_first_name] have resulted in the Prime Minister finally deciding he had no recourse but to resign his post. The king thanked him for his service to the British cause, and then appointed Robert Vansittart to the post. The replacement comes at the largest shake-up in the British Exile power structure since their arrival into Canada in 1926, and as Vasittart begins to make changes to the Privy Council cabinet-in-exile the ripples are sure to be felt throughout the government."
canada.77.a: "Interesting"
canada.100.t: "Québec in Flames"
canada.100.d: "Across Québec, French Canadians have taken to the streets in massive protests against the country's conscription policy. In Montreal alone, a massive crowd filled St. Catherine Street with loud chanting against both the Prime Minister as well as King [CAN_king_first_name]. It's a re-enactment of the Conscription Crisis of 1917, though this time it seems French Canadians have lost their patience. 'Again and again we are called upon to shed French blood on behalf of English wars in Europe!' Québec Premier Maurice Duplessis told a large and angry crowd in Québec City. 'We say no, and they tell us we must! Québec will never be free of English tyranny so long as it is the lapdog to English politicians!'"

A large group of French Canadian marchers set fire to several factories, causing considerable damage before RCMP forces were able to disperse the group and bring order back to the region. Tensions in [french_state.GetName] remain high."
canada.102.d.arms: "Emergency crews were called to an arms factory in [french_state.GetName] this week as a huge explosion wracked the facility, causing a great deal of damage. Factory management blames a group of its own French Canadian workers, though no proof of this has so far been uncovered by RCMP investigators."
canada.102.d.riots: "A series of demonstrations in [french_state.GetName] have turned violent this week, leading to clashes with both the military and RCMP forces. A curfew has been established in several cities, and while an uneasy order has finally been restored the damage caused by the rioters has left its mark on the region."
canada.102.d.ringleader: "RCMP investigators were pleased to report that a group of French Canadian activists have been arrested in [french_state.GetName], ringleaders behind a recent string of violent demonstrations and bombings.

canada.104.t: "The Montreal Conference"
canada.104.d: "Members of the Federal government met today with Québec Premier Maurice Duplessis and a wide assortment of French Canadian politicians and activists in Montreal, in an attempt to sort out the differences between French and English Canadians. The topic of conscription came up repeatedly, but overall there was a feeling that the Québecois felt as if they were an unequal partner in Confederation. While tempers flared several times over the course of the conference, Federal delegates left feeling as if progress had been made and that there was at least the possibility of reconciliation... provided the government was willing to give French Canadians special status both for the French language as well as politically."
canada.104.a: "That's a lot to ask for..."
canada.105.t: "Special Status for Québec"
canada.105.d: "Agreement has finally been reached on a solution that, for now, will see Québec a more willing participant in the Federal government's goals. They've been granted certain privileges unique to the province - the ability to control immigration and exert controls over French language use, powers that are normally reserved for the Federal government itself. While there are many English Canadians who consider this a bribe, and it will still have to go through the long process of amending the Canadian constitution, most are pleased enough to have the conflict over with - at least for now. Québec Premier Maurice Duplessis is calling this a victory and has been busy selling it to French Canadians, so - for the time being - the conflict with Québec appears to be over."
canada.105.a: "Thank heavens for that!"
canada.106.t: "The Suppression of French Canadians"
canada.106.d: "at the order of the Federal government, both the RCMP and Canadian armed forces have moved into Québec in large numbers. Streets are being patrolled, large gatherings dispersed, and force used when absolutely necessary in order to maintain order. The pictures of violence plastered on the front pages of newspapers aren't sitting well with many Canadians, but most admit there appears to be little alternative at the moment. 'We cannot negotiate with violence,' the Prime Minister said to the House of Commons, and that appears to be the end of it."
canada.106.a: "So must it be"
canada.107.t: "Québec Premier Replaced"
canada.107.d: "Throughout Québec, English-speaking Canadians have been quietly replacing Québecois in important provincial positions - culminating with a new provincial election that resulted in the defeat of Maurice Duplessis and the election of Adélard Godbout, leader of the Québec Liberals and much more amenable to working with the Federal government. There have been charges that the Federal government went out of its way to quietly promote Godbout and suppress French-speaking Canadians from participating in the vote... but, so far, these charges have not been proven and are being actively ignored."
canada.107.a: "Welcome, Premier"

canada.108.d.war: "The War Measures Act, legislation which grants the Federal government sweeping powers to override civil liberties and ignore Parliament, has been passed and read out to the House of Commons by King [CAN_king_first_name]. Having been enacted only once before, in 1917 during the Great War, it has ostensibly been passed to deal with Canada's current war... though most understand it is primarily to deal with the unrest in Québec. The king's first act was to dismiss the Prime Minister, replacing him with former Conservative leader Arthur Meighen. As a result, the king has been the focal point of many Canadians who are protesting the government's move, saying the War Measures Act is unnecessary and tyrannical."

canada.110.t: "Demonstrations Across Canada"
canada.110.d: "The 'purge' of opposition in the House of Commons end the ending of debate has caused a wave of protests across Canada, with large demonstrations in Toronto and Vancouver filled with people calling the government un-Canadian and suggesting King [CAN_king_first_name] is using the protests in Québec as an excuse to grab power. 'This is un-Canadian,' said Mackenzie King at the Toronto protest, 'and solely a move by a desperate British government to force Canada's compliance when it is most vulnerable.' So far, RCMP has been able to keep the demonstrations from turning violent, but the anger among Canadians is running deep."
canada.110.a: "Not good at all"
canada.111.t: "Parliament Suspended"
canada.111.d: "Exerting royal prerogative, King [CAN_king_first_name] has taken the unprecedented move of suspending the Canadian Parliament and establishing what is seen by many as an absolute monarchy. Though, on the surface, the king is acting through the Conservative Prime Minister and his cabinet, it is clear that the British Exiles are now firmly - even if unofficially - in charge of the country. The king's action is widely seen as one born of emergency, and a temporary measure intended to get Canada through the war and the Home Isles finally reclaimed. Demonstrations against the king were half-hearted and quickly put down by security forces, with only a handful of newspapers lamenting that Canada was 'a colony once more'."

canada.112.t: "Conscription Crisis in Quebec"
canada.112.d: "French-speaking Canadians have long opposed conscription, viewing the idea of fighting wars on behalf of the British as offensive. Now that the Canadian government has enacted full conscription in the country, the response across the French-speaking province of Québec has been swift: French Canadians have taken to the streets in massive, crippling protests. It's a re-enactment of the Conscription Crisis of 1917, although this time it seems French Canadians have lost their patience. 'Again and again we are called upon to shed French blood on behalf of English wars!' Québec Premier Maurice Duplessis told an angry crowd in Québec City. 'We say no, and they tell us we must!

Having been enacted only once before, in 1917 during the Weltkrieg, it has ostensibly been passed to deal with Canada's current war... though most understand it is primarily to deal with the massive unrest in Québec. King [CAN_king_first_name]'s first measure taken under the Act's new authority was to dismiss the Prime Minister, replacing him with former Conservative leader, Arthur Meighen, a hardliner who is part of the king's inner circle.

canada.115.a: "That's a relief"
canada.116.t: "The King Addresses the Senate"
canada.116.d: "King [CAN_king_first_name] has spoke publicly for the first time since exercising the royal prerogative a week ago. In a raucous speech to the Senate, the King has declared that "in order to ensure security and continuing stability, the Kingdom of Canada will be reorganized into the second British Empire, for a safe and secure society". He went on to announce that the House of Commons will be suspended indefinitely, so the Senate, composed almost entirely of Exile loyalists appointed by the King, will hold all the real power in the country until the Isles are reclaimed. These comments seemed to have invigorated the Exile population and many are even considering retaking lost territories in the West in order to bolster the British cause toward securing the birthright. Predictably, the Canadian population has not taken well to this news and planned protests across the nation, most of which were quickly quashed by the Exile-aligned military."

canada.150.t: "Access to Ireland"
canada.150.d: "In terms of our being able to conduct an invasion of Great Britain, the best solution would be to bring [IRE.GetNameDef] into the Entente... or, at least, to convince them to give our military access. An alliance will require some kind of large aid package at the very least, while access might only call for us to offer our protection. Some are convinced that the Irish will hold onto their historical grudges against the British, but perhaps they'll see that times have changed?"

canada.151.d: "An envoy from the [From.GetAdjective] government has arrived, offering us a rather impressive financial aid package in exchange for Irish admission into the Entente alliance... which would almost certainly mean war with [ENG.GetNameDef]. They are desperate for a place to launch their invasion, and Ireland is as close to Britain as one can get. Some members of the government are in favor, though others suggest that the British overlords of Canada would almost certainly betray us once the war was over - as they always have."

canada.152.t: "The Irish have a Condition"
canada.152.d: "We have a response from the Irish government - namely this: they'll agree to join the Entente, but only if we and the British Exiles promise that, once the war is over, they'll have their sovereignty over all of Ireland recognized and be assured full independence. It appears they don't trust the British, and perhaps for good reason?"

The [ENG.GetAdjective] government might not be happy about it, but at least we wouldn't be part of their war."

canada.170.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has approached us with an interesting offer: seeing as we are in dire straits, economically, they are willing to assist our recovery with a large aid package. In return, we would join the Entente and enjoy their protection... and provide them with a means to launch an invasion of [ENG.GetNameDef]. While this solves several of our issues, it also means involving ourselves in a war we have no real stake in."

canada.174.d: "King [CAN_king_first_name] has been active over the last several weeks, loudly and publicly demanding to know why an attack on [ENG.GetNameDef] hadn't already begun. 'We are ready,' he proclaimed. 'What's more, the syndicalists become more prepared every moment longer we wait, so we shall never be more ready than we are right now. Come what may, the attack must begin!' A large number of Canadians agree with him, it appears, as newspapers across the country have splashed 'Begin the Attack!' across their front pages for days, now."

As we thought, they've been collecting numbers and equipment since the fall of the Empire... and while they haven't the strength to take on the syndicalists by themselves, they're more than ready to rise up now that we have our foothold in [invasion_state.GetName]. They have gathered in the hills of northern Scotland, and are prepared to attack at our command."

Their appearance has sent shock waves throughout Britain, though ministers have assured the government the matter should be stabilized within months. With any luck, this is our opportunity to wipe out the Canadians and the loyalists both."

They have gathered in the state under our direction, and are now rising against the syndicalist forces."

canada.200.d: "The government is becoming alarmed at the rapidly-developing crisis in the United States, particularly with the rise of the Socialist Party of America. A syndicalist-aligned nation on our southern border would be unthinkable. The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out. We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."

While the assassination of Bill Haywood has meant the Socialist Party of America was unable to gather the will to rise up - a fact for which the Canadian government is extremely grateful - it still seems unthinkable that the American government would go to such lengths, and makes many wonder if Huey Long's accusations of corruption and tyranny are true. Even if they are, should we involve ourselves? The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out. We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."
canada.200.d.peace: "The government is becoming alarmed at the rapidly-developing crisis in the United States. While the compromise reached between the government and the Socialist Party of America means there is no threat of a syndicalist uprising - a fact for which the Canadian government is extremely grateful - it is still difficult to watch such rampant destruction. The violence is already terrible - to the point that numerous state governors in the American northeast, lacking confidence in the Federal government to maintain order, have asked us to step in should civil war break out. We do not have to answer their request yet, but once the deadline ends we may very well be forced to."
canada.200.a: "Unbelievable!"
canada.201.t: "The Prospect of Intervention"
canada.201.d.csa: "Parliament has begun a tense debate over whether the Canadian government should recognize one of the warring factions in the south the 'real' America. It's a tricky situation, as doing so will anger the other factions and potentially leave us with a hostile victor in the south... but even worse is the prospect of the so-called [CSA.GetNameDef] winning the day. We cannot be expected to fight wars elsewhere with a syndicalist government sitting directly to the south, can we? For now, support merely means directing the Entente to send volunteers and equipment, but - if we pick a side - some suggest our getting drawn into the conflict will become inevitable."
canada.201.d.nocsa: "Parliament has begun a tense debate over whether the Canadian government should recognize one of the warring factions in the south the 'real' America. It's a tricky situation, as doing so will anger the other factions and potentially leave us with a hostile victor in the south... and, really, with the fears of a syndicalist faction having proven to be baseless, do we have any call to interfere at all? Many in the government are saying we should do nothing, and let the chips fall where they may. A few, however, say that betting on a winner could nab us a friendly ally, and potentially a grateful future member of the Entente."
canada.201.a: "We should not get involved"
canada.201.b: "The Federal government is, of course, the only legitimate one"
canada.201.c: "We recognize [CAL.GetNameDef] as the true America"

canada.201.f: "We support [COR.GetNameDef] in their righteous cause"
canada.202.t: "Refugees Flood into [refugee_state.GetName]"
canada.202.d: "With the situation in America worsening, it's no surprise that [Root.GetNameDef] has become the top destination for those fleeing the violence. Many of the immigrants are legal, but an increasingly large number are not. Already there are several refugee camps in [refugee_state.GetName], many of them coming from [flee_from_state.GetName], and their numbers are putting a strain on our supplies. Observers comment that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better."
canada.202.a: "American refugees? The irony..."
canada.203.t: "[refugee_state.GetName] Refugee Situation Worsens"
canada.203.d: "While officials in [refugee_state.GetName] have already been struggling to contain the numbers of American refugees crossing the border, recently the situation has grown even worse. A new flood of refugees, most coming from [flee_from_state.GetName], has already arrived and put an increasing strain on the province's infrastructure."
canada.203.a: "Let's hope this ends soon"
canada.204.t: "The Refugee Crisis"
canada.204.d: "The number of illegal refugees crossing the border from America has become a national crisis, impacting [Root.GetNameDef]'s stability and supply capabilities, not to mention the amount of soldiers required to keep the peace. If the current rate of arrivals continues, things are sure to get worse. Parliament is arguing that the government should figure out what to do -- and quickly."
canada.204.a: "What a mess"
canada.205.t: "The Refugee Crisis Deepens"
canada.205.d: "Having not heeded earlier warnings, the crisis caused by the mass arrival of American refugees fleeing the civil war in the south has become worse. Violence in and around the camps along the border has increased, and their reputation is such that many refugees are now attempting to enter the country illegally - where they are sure to face exploitation by the unscrupulous."
canada.205.a: "Something must be done"
canada.206.t: "Trade with America"
canada.206.d: "[Root.GetNameDefCap] relies a great deal on its trade routes that go to the United States. While the civil war has benefitted us in some ways, namely that orders for Canadian goods from abroad have increased as American sources become unreliable, the fact is that many of our exports have always gone to America itself... with our biggest customer now an unreliable destination, our economy is left reeling and attempting to figure out what to do until the civil war is ended."
canada.206.a: "As if we needed more problems"
canada.207.t: "Clashes in Windsor"
canada.207.d: "The city of Windsor lies directly across from Detroit, a stronghold of the syndicalist [CSA.GetName]. We've suspected for a while, now, that syndicalist agents have crossed the border secretly, some with the refugees, and now it seems that belief has been vindicated with the city being engulfed in clashes between industrial workers and the police. The police say these 'sympathizers' are being spurred on by syndicalist agents. Whether this is true or not, the violence has continued for several days and only just now been contained."
canada.207.a: "Syndicalists in Canada? This cannot be!"
canada.208.t: "Militias Cross into [473.GetName]"
canada.208.d: "A syndicalist uprising in the state of Washington has spilled across the border as the militia units use it to evade and get around their opponents. This has caused considerable consternation in the region, as Canadian forces have needed to move in and tighten security, with several clashes having already occurred along southern highways. Several incidents of attacks and looting on civilian townships have led to British Columbia being gripped with fear, thinking that - at any moment - syndicalist militias could arrive out of nowhere."
canada.208.a: "Not good"
canada.209.t: "Riot at St. Catharines Camp"
canada.209.d: "Violence has been a common problem at refugee camps, due mainly to conflicts between the refugees themselves as well as with the guards, but also due to the poor conditions. The St. Catharines Camp is one of the most densely-populated in the province, and conditions there have apparently gotten so bad that a full-scale riot by the refugees broke out. They overwhelmed the guards, spilling out of the camp and heading into the outer Toronto area where they were eventually stopped by Ontario provincial police. It is feared this is only the first incident on this scale we're likely to see."
canada.209.a: "This needs to stop"
canada.210.t: "Sympathy Strikes Across Canada"
canada.210.d.csa: "Across the nation, numerous labour unions have risen up in sympathy strikes for [CSA.GetNameDef]. The SPA, they say, has been unfairly characterized as tyrannical, when it is merely combating the larger tyranny of capitalism run rampant. They want the Canadian government to stop 'fear-mongering' against the syndicalists. The strikes have been unruly and disruptive, and in several cases have resulted in violent clashes with the RCMP. Several arrests have been made, and the RCMP is keeping a close eye on strike organizers."
canada.210.d.aus: "Across the nation, numerous groups have risen up in 'sympathy strikes' for [TEX.GetNameDef]. They are creating blockades and enforcing work-stoppages in several cities, claiming they are doing so in support of Huey Long. 'His fight for the average American is the same fight faced by average people everywhere,' said one organizer. The strikes have been unruly and disruptive, and in several cases have resulted in violent clashes with the RCMP. Several arrests have been made, and the RCMP is keeping a close eye on strike organizers."

canada.211.d.nee: "Parliament has been engulfed by argument over what to do regarding the American refugees. Doing nothing is not an option, but many MP's are saying that a massive relief effort is needed to improve conditions in the camps. The expense, they say, is justified because 'Americans are our brothers and sisters, and we must care for them in their hour of need'. In a similar vein, Louis St. Laurent has proposed what he calls Project Samaritan - an even broader relief effort, spreading out the camps and housing refugees with average Canadians. There, the most able would be put to work alongside factory workers and labourers, a far better life than doing nothing inside a camp. The Conservatives, meanwhile, say that the security risk is too great. They have proposed the majority of refugees all be shipped to [NEE.GetNameDef], along with all newcomers. 'This is an American problem,' they say, 'and it should be handled by Americans.'"

canada.213.d: "All across the country, recruiters are now active at refugee camps, offering the most able a placement within the army. Most understand this is a temporary arrangement - once the war is over, it seems likely that many of them will leave the army and return home again. In the mean time, however, our good treatment of the refugees has led to a large number of men entering our service. They'll fight for the country which has taken them in, they say, even if it means fighting against Americans back home."

canada.214.d.ceasefirecsa: "The ceasefire has meant an end to the American civil war, at least for now, and so a large number of refugees have begun returning home. The fact that [CSA.GetNameDef] is victorious in the east does not sit well with many, however. Those that can are largely going to [CAL.GetNameDef], while others have decided to stay in Canada for good. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
canada.214.d.ceasefirenocsa: "The ceasefire has meant an end to the American civil war, at least for now, and so the vast majority of refugees have begun returning home. The fact that the ceasefire will eventually end and the conflict undoubtedly renewed does not still well with many, who have decided to either stay in Canada for good or head for destinations further afield. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
canada.214.d.noceasefirecsa: "The civil war in America is over, with [CSA.GetNameDef] having won the day. While this does not sit well with most of the refugees, many believe they have no choice but to return - the worst of the violence is over, after all, or so they hope. Many others have decided to stay in Canada, saying that America is now syndicalist and thus dead to them. Regardless of where they go, the refugee crisis in Canada appears to be over."
canada.214.d.noceasefirenocsa: "The civil war in America is over, and thus the vast majority of the refugees have decided to return - either to face justice or participate in the reconstruction.

canada.216.d: "The Canadian Prime Minister has made a state visit to [Root.GetNameDef], congratulating the President on having reformed America. In private sessions, he has stated his belief that this could not have been done without the help of Canada and the Entente, and thus he hopes that a more permanent alliance between our two countries will result. He suggests a transfer of any owned states claimed by the other, to prevent future conflicts, and for [Root.GetNameDef] to be a more committed and permanent member of the Entente going forward. 'Ours is a special friendship,' he said, 'and I believe it benefits the world if it continues.'"

According to the President, they are fine with relations between [From.GetNameDef] and [Root.GetNameDef] remaining as they are... meaning they would prefer to keep us at an arms length. Still, the visit was cordial, and several beneficial trade terms were reached."

We cannot prevent it from happening, but some believe it might be possible to delay. If we were to quietly contact and fund Canadian labour movements, get them to rise up in strikes that have obvious syndicalist connections, the Canadians might be too paranoid to take action until the strikes are shut down. It would, at most, buy us a few months if we keep it up. Otherwise? We should prepare to face an invasion from the north soon."

canada.224.t: "Nationwide Strike Begins"
canada.224.d: "Labour leaders across the country have called for strikes - enough to cripple the Canadian economy, and causing disruption from one end of the nation to the other. There are those in our government who suggest the strikes are too suspiciously timed... this must be an effort by [CSA.GetNameDef] to cause revolution before we can act. Regardless of the intent, all agree that the strikes must be shut down before we can think about intervening in the south."

The speeches written by the labour leaders, according to the RCMP, might very well have been written by the [CSA.GetAdjective] government. They will have proof soon, they say, but until they discover the source of the strike funding, we will need to combat the strikers and put down this irritating distraction."
canada.225.a: "How annoying"
canada.226.t: "Nationwide Strike Continues"
canada.226.d: "The national labour unions have not relented in their pro-CSA strikes, with violence occurring all along the picket lines and clashes with the police frequent. The RCMP, however, has good news: they have discovered how [CSA.GetNameDef] has been getting funds and equipment to the strikers and they have shut down those channels for good and arrested the ringleaders on our side of the border. The syndicalists will not be able to use this disruption tactic against us again. Once the strike is put down, any fears we have of syndicalist revolution will be over."

The rest will likely leave over the next year, constituting a large drain on [Root.GetNameDef]'s resources. Still, most of Canada is relieved to see them go.

While many supported replacing the position with the old Governor General's posts, King [CAN_king_first_name] has refused, officializing his position as King of both Great Britain and Canada. With this recent declaration, Canada has been solidified as a monarchy in its own right, both separate from yet inherently linked to the British throne through [GBR.GetLeader].

canada.304.d: "It seems there are enough Canadians who either feel the British overstayed their welcome or who now feel as if Canada has been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten, that the idea of a referendum on Canada's future in the Commonwealth has rapidly gained traction. French Canadians in Québec are the ones most strongly in favor of cutting ties with the monarchy, but the sentiment is strong enough elsewhere that a national vote is felt necessary. The debates have already sprung up, and it's a contentious issue - one responsible for a sharp and bitter divide between Canadian households and family members, some who feel that Canada should be proud of what it has accomplished for the Empire and others who ask 'what has the Empire done for us?'"

canada.305.t: "Demonstrations Across Québec"
canada.305.d: "The national debate over the referendum heated up this week with anti-monarchy demonstrations taking place across the province of Québec. The largest was in Québec City, where a massive crowd of over 100,000 showed up from across the province, angered by the suppression they endured during the conscription crisis - on the orders, they believe, of the British Monarchy. True or not, the French Canadians are adamant that their continued place in Canada depends on the referendum passing. Québecois leaders who shouted 'if the referendum fails, there is no future for the French in Canada' met with wild cheers of support. If the crowd was at all subdued, it was because the demonstrations were watched over by thousands of wary Canadian soldiers and police officers."

The angry protestors railed against a police line which protected the building from damage, and with good reason considering the threats in previous days by anti-monarchy radicals to burn Rideau Hall to the ground. After hours of confrontation, anti-riot police were called in to disperse the crowd with tear gas, leading many moderate observers to say that it was a dark day in the history of Canadian democracy."

While some pointed out that the crowd was largely formed of older, English-speaking Canadians, it was still a stern reminder of how deeply British traditions run in Canada. The conservative speakers reminded the crowd that, without Britain, Canada would not even exist... and they were met with loud cheers. Many of those present spoke fondly of the royal family, and expressed disgust that Canadians would even think of breaking with tradition so readily."
canada.307.a: "Interesting"
canada.308.t: "The King's Radio Address"
canada.308.d: "King [CAN_king_first_name] today spoke to the Canadian public by a radio address from Buckingham Palace, taking pains to thank the country for its years of labour and the blood shed on the Empire's behalf. 'Do not think we have forgotten Canada's service,' he said, 'for it has not been and shall never be. Canada has proven itself to be far more than a colony, far more capable and more dutiful than we could possibly have hoped. It was a safe harbour, and for many of us it was home.' He asked that Canadians consider carefully before they chartered a destiny away from the Commonwealth, though in added that - should they choose to leave - the British would be morally bound to respect their collective decision and merely hope that the two countries could continue a long and fruitful friendship."
canada.308.a: "Well said!"
canada.309.t: "The Fleming Inquiry Begins"
canada.309.d.wma: "Considered by some to be disastrous timing, a federal inquiry into the alleged abuses by the government after the invocation of the War Measures Act, headed by Conservative MP Sir Donald Fleming, released its preliminary findings today. While the inquiry stated that it had a great deal more statements to collect and research to conduct, it stressed that it had so far found little evidence to support the idea that the government went beyond that which was 'merited by extreme circumstances'. For those furious at the Canadian government's short cut around democracy, they have declared the inquiry nothing short of a cover up. Rather than addressing the anger, it seems the Fleming Inquiry has stoked it even further."
canada.309.d.pataut: "Considered by some to be disastrous timing, a federal inquiry into the alleged abuses by the government after the shutdown of Parliament on the king's order, headed by Conservative MP Sir Donald Fleming, released its preliminary findings today. While the inquiry stated that it had a great deal more statements to collect and research to conduct, it stressed that it had so far found little evidence to support the idea that the government went beyond that which was 'merited by extreme circumstances'. For those furious at the idea that the British government-in-exile took control over Canada in what they deem a coup, they have declared the inquiry nothing short of a cover up. Rather than addressing the anger, it seems the Fleming Inquiry has stoked it even further."
canada.309.a: "Congratulations, Mr. Fleming, you played yourself"
canada.310.t: "Prime Minister Calls for Unity"
canada.310.d: "The Canadian Prime Minister today spoke to the country through a televised address, warning that a rift in the 'special relationship' between [CAN.GetNameDef] and [GBR.GetNameDef] would be disastrous for both countries. He pointed out that the government maintained a strong record of democracy throughout the war, and that the king's guidance was invaluable without ever overstepping the boundaries allowed him by both law and tradition. 'After going so far to see the United Kingdom and the monarchy restored, it would be ill-suited for us to spit in the face of our own history. This is a time of healing and recovery, not one where we should create further divisions and anger.'"
canada.310.a: "But will Canada listen?"
canada.311.t: "Canadian Referendum Imminent"
canada.311.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and King [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] has evidently been left with the feeling that the British overstayed their welcome... or that Canada has now been left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. The country has been debating a national referendum on the future of the Commonwealth, and should the vote pass then it will cut ties with the monarchy completely. What this would mean for [CAN.GetNameDef]'s place in the Entente, and the connections it developed with its fellow alliance members during its years of leadership, is currently unknown."
canada.311.a: "Campaign hard for the vote to fail"
canada.311.b: "It's their decision to make"
canada.311.c: "Goodness!"
canada.315.t: "The National Referendum"
canada.315.d: "The day of Canada's referedum is upon us, with millions of Canadians going to the polls across the country. Indeed, interest is so high that polling stations are having trouble keeping up with the long lines. The question facing the nation: do they cut ties with the British monarchy and the Commonwealth, continuing on as a nation in charge of its own constitution and its own government, or do they go on as a Dominion and a close ally of [GBR.GetNameDef], the monarchy continuing as a symbol of tradition and history both?"
canada.315.a: "We must cut ties with the monarchy"
canada.315.b: "We are a loyal member of the Empire"
canada.316.t: "Canada Cuts ties with the Monarchy"
canada.316.d: "With [GBR.GetNameDef] restored and King [CAN_king_first_name] restored to Buckingham Palace, [CAN.GetNameDef] evidently now feels left behind, unrewarded and forgotten once its task was complete. Over the last month, the country has been gripped with a divisive debate over the future of their place in the Commonwealth. French-speaking Canadians were adamantly opposed, while more traditional-minded English-speaking Canadians were in favor of remaining. The anger over the referendum led to violent demonstrations and near riots, culminating in the vote that took place today - which has been answered with a definitive 'yes'. Canada will go forward, no longer a Dominion but rather a country in charge of its own government. Whether it will have a place in the Entente alliance remains to be seen."

canada.317.b: "Interesting"
canada.318.t: "Québec Nationalists Surge in Elections"
canada.318.d: "Spurred on by anger among French-speaking Canadians at the continued loyalty shown by English Canadians towards [GBR.GetNameDef], the recent Québec provincial elections have shown a massive resurgence of the Union Nationale with Maurice Duplessis easily winning a majority of seats based on a campaign of sovereignty for Québec. Duplessis now has a mandate to proceed with the process of separation, though it is unclear how that would be done - or if the federal government would even permit it."
canada.318.a: "It seems suppression was not enough"
canada.319.t: "The Question of Québec Sovereignty"
canada.319.d: "It is clear that the Québecois have lost confidence in the Canadian Confederation. They feel they are the lesser partner, the bitterness towards the British monarchy and the divisions between French Canadians and English Canadians too deep. Premier Maurice Duplessis has officially demanded that Québec be allowed to separate... though there is no clear mechanism for it to do so. Considering how many English Canadians live in Québec, who would surely become second class citizens after separation, we would be justified in blocking the attempt. Then again, perhaps this would make things better in the long run?"
canada.319.a: "They cannot be allowed to separate"
canada.319.b: "We will grant them autonomy, but not independence"
canada.319.c: "Let them go - we will remain friends, after all"
canada.320.t: "Québec Separates from Canada"
canada.320.d.free: "French- and English-speaking Canadians have been at odds in [CAN.GetNameDef] ever since the country's creation in 1867. Now, the French-speaking citizens of Québec have decided that the divisions, exacerbated by the abuses of the British Exiles while they were in charge of the country, are beyond healing. They have demanded separation from the country, and the Canadian government, perhaps believing that the interests of stability would be better served in letting them go, has permitted it. The breakup is amicable, with many economic and cultural ties still remaining between the countries, but it remains to be seen if the goodwill will last in the coming years. For now, President-elect Maurice Duplessis is the head of the newest nation in the world, greeting large cheering crowds in Québec City, all of whom are ecstatic that the seemingly impossible has finally been achieved."

While it is not everything the Québecois wanted, autonomy does allow them to control their own immigration and culture, and new President-elect Maurice Duplessis has vowed that, in time, full independence will be achieved."

canada.320.c: "Interesting"
canada.321.t: "Canadian Constitution Patriated"
canada.321.d: "The British North America Act, which established the Confederation of Canada in 1867, has been under the jurisdiction of the British Parliament - indeed, even while the British government was in exile, they were still tehnically the masters of Canada's destiny. This is true no longer, as the document has been officially patriated and presented to the Canadian Prime Minister in a solemn ceremony held in Ottawa today. The Prime Minister greeted a cheering crowd, saying that 'Canada is a colony no longer - together we have achieved victory against the syndicalists and proven our strength and preserverence as a nation. Now, with our consitutiton ours to amend as we see fit, we go forward a truly independent nation!'"
canada.321.a: "Well done, Canada!"
canada.322.t: "The Birth of Canadian Nationalism"
canada.322.d: "Canadian nationalism was never like that of their American cousins to the south. Always it has been more geared towards the idea of national unity rather than that of manifest destiny. In a century where America has faltered, however, it is Canada who has risen to the challenge... and thus this a national pride has begun to take hold, one where Canadians seek to prove their independence and shake off their image as an unassuming country existing on America's fringes, coupled with a growing disaffection for their ties to - and the decisions made by - the Old Empire."
canada.322.a: "Let's not get carried away, eh?"
canada.323.t: "Canada Withdraws from the Entente"
canada.323.d: "Having cut ties with the British monarchy, it was only a matter of time before the Canadian government addressed their role in the Entente alliance - and now they have done so, definitively, announcing their withdrawal from all roles in the Entente effective as of today. Considering that it was Canada who led the Entente for so many years, military leaders in the alliance are left wondering what this means for its future... and, indeed, if the ties to Canada can ever truly be broken. While British officials have scoffed at Canada leaving itself 'foolishly isolated', the Canadians appear confident that their role as an independent and strong nation can only bring further prosperity."
canada.323.a: "It was time"

canada.323.c: "The Entente without Canada is difficult to imagine"
canada.324.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Claims [claimed_state.GetName]"
canada.324.d: "With a surge in nationalism since cutting ties to [GBR.GetNameDef], [From.GetNameDef] has laid claim to the state of [claimed_state.GetName], currently held by [Root.GetNameDef]. It is, according to the [From.GetAdjective] government, part of their 'greater destiny'. Whether they intend to back up their claim remains to be seen."
canada.324.a: "They dare!"
canada.325.t: "Diefenbaker Wins Nationalist Leadership"
canada.325.d: "The growth of Canadian nationalism has had a number of side effects, one of which has included the rapid growth of the Nationalist Party - considered until now to be a frige group of anti-British extremists. With a large number of Conservative Party members defecting to the party, it was inevitable that leadership would eventually pass on from aging Henry Herbert Stevens. Today that proved true, as the young up-and-comer politician, John Diefenbaker, won the party's leadership at its Toronto convention. The charismatic Diefenbaker promised to an enthusiastic crowd of supporters that he would lead Canada into a new era of prosperity in the next election."
canada.325.a: "Interesting, but doubtful"
canada.326.t: "Canadian Investments"
canada.326.d: "After the fall of the United Kingdom, the British Exiles flocked to Canada with their expertise and their money... and, now that we are the ones struggling to rebuild a tattered economy, the reverse is happening. Canadian entrepeneurs, many of the British expatriates who have chosen to remain in their new home, are coming to Britain to take advantage of the many opportunities that exist here. It is making the Canadians wealthy, true, but it is also benefiting us a great deal. We have so many ties between us, so many familiar contacts, that the association is a natural one, and it is helping Britain rebuild faster than ever before."
canada.326.a: "We welcome their presence"
canada.327.t: "A New Generation of Officers"
canada.327.d: "Many young Canadian officers proved their value during the reconquest of the United Kingdom, showing their valour and their commanding abilities. Now that many British officers have returned home, the Armed Forces Council is promoting many of these Canadians to higher command posts. Some of them have also been given important roles in military academies, so that their experience will help shape a future generation of tacticians, strategists, and leaders."
canada.327.a: "Excellent"
canada.328.t: "The Kingdom of Iceland?"
canada.328.d: "Having taken control over Iceland recently, we not only can utilize it for ourselves, we can also have a say over it’s own internal workings. It is of course barely a question as to giving the Icelandic people autonomy once more in order to appease them, albeit with a much more friendly government to Ottawa as well as free usage of Reykjavik harbor. However, the King is thinking that instead of giving all governance back to a native Icelandic government, we could perhaps install a monarch in Iceland in order to gain lawful control over the island for decades to come. The candidate to the created Icelandic throne would be Edward VIII’s cousin, Princess Alexandra, who would be crowned Queen of the island and given say over it’s affairs alongside a civilian Prime Minister.\n\nBut of course who is to say that the king must give the throne to anyone else but himself, and so if we decide the previous two options of natives and another member of the Windsors are unsatisfactory for leading Iceland, why not give King Edward the reins to do as he pleases?"
canada.328.a: "Stick to a native Icelandic government"
canada.328.b: "Iceland requires the watchful eye of a queen"
canada.328.c: "King Edward takes the Icelandic throne for himself!"

canada.999.t: "The Errant Son Returns"
canada.999.d: "After 150 years of being apart, what once was the thirteen colonies has returned to the British crown. The transgressions of the War of 1776 have finally been rectified, and the Eastern Seaboard of North America, from New Brunswick to Houston, lies in our control. The King has taken a tour of what was previously Washington, to the chagrin of many. Facing almost a raucous cacophony of boos and jeers from onlooking crowds, the King patiently waited for Mounties and other police to quiet down the crowd before commencing the first speech of the British crown on American soil in two centuries. While the American army has collapsed, fighting still continues in every corner. Our patrols from the Everglades to the Rocky Mountains have been harried and assaulted from resistance groups. Every single faction in the turbulent American political landscape have abandoned their feuds, instead focusing their total efforts on undermining our presence. Our administration is stretched thin, and requests our new American territory to be dissected into smaller, more manageable states. However, this is likely to aggravate the uppity Americans even more. What shall our course of action be?"
canada.999.a: "Dissolve the very notion of America!"
canada.999.b: "The Americans will have their kingdom."

At the [Root.GetAdjective] government's direction, members of the Entente may be invited into the IEDC, where they will be prompted - once a year - to make an investment of political power into its pool, and investment that gains them access to the IEDC's advisors.

entente.2.d: "A delegation from the [From.GetAdjective] government arrived today to formally invite [Root.GetNameDef] to join the IEDC - the Imperial Economic Development Council. The IEDC was created to foster greater economic cooperation within the Entente, with yearly (and voluntary) contributions of political power which are invested back in member nations at the discretion of [From.GetNameDef]. There are those in the government who express concern whether [Root.GetNameDef] would actually see a return for its investment, seeing as [From.GetNameDef] could simply decide to invest everything in itself, but considering donations are voluntary it seems like that would ensure a short life for the IEDC."

Yet there is also resolution, for the tyranny of syndicalism cannot be allowed to reign over any free people... least of which the people of our United Kingdom.

entente.20.d.peace2: "[CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the nations of the Entente by radio, warning that - even in this time of peace - the alliance must stand ready to face the unknown. 'The Union of Britain has been defeated,' he said, 'but ours is a brittle peace, and it is only through vigilance that our freedom is maintained. There yet remains much to be done in this world, much that requires our attention, and as our alliance has proven strong by every possible measure it is with every confidence that I know we shall continue to meet these challenges with the grace and courage with which our alliance has been long-defined.'"

King [CAN_king_first_name] is expected to meet with all manner of dignitaries throughout [Root.GetNameDef] - indeed, there are so many clamoring for royal attention, the king's staff has been reportedly overwhelmed with requests. Each stop on the king's itinerary is expected to have huge crowds, with a massive parade planned in [parade_state.GetName] in the king's honor. [Root.GetAdjective] officials are extraordinarily pleased with the king's visit, and it seems every effort to roll out the red carpet for him will be spared."

entente.23.d: "While on his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], King [CAN_king_first_name] has found himself embroiled in a scandal - allegedly involving a married [tour_country.GetAdjective] heiress. While there is no direct proof beyond a few blurry photographs, attempts to keep the scandal under wraps have failed and it's been the front page on [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers for weeks. The king says his tour will continue, though there are many who say the goodwill previously generated by it has already all but evaporated."

entente.24.d: "While on his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef], King [CAN_king_first_name] has found himself embroiled in a major scandal. Apparently, the king was overheard in private conversation with his aides, and the nature was so inflammatory that it led to immediate headlines in [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers... headlines which were then supported by anonymous sources within the king's staff and then carried onto papers throughout the Entente. While initially King [CAN_king_first_name] insisted on continuing his tour, he has since cut it short and declared that he is 'taking some time' in his private [KR_king_base.GetAdjective] estate. This is no doubt to give the scandal time to blow over, though the damage to his reputation - and the goodwill he generated during his tour - has clearly already been done."

The king was unharmed but quickly evacuated, and a manhunt for the would-be assassin is already underway. King [CAN_king_first_name] has been forced to call his tour short, taking with him a sincere apology by the [tour_country.GetAdjective] government... though, outside of the trouble caused by the clamp-down of [tour_country.GetAdjective] security forces, the goodwill of the [tour_country.GetAdjective] public has been unaffected. Indeed, the newspapers have been declaring nothing but praise for the king, who has since declared he will be taking a few months off of public appearances to recover from the ordeal."

entente.26.d: "King [CAN_king_first_name]'s tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef] has been cut short due to the king's illness, which the royal staff claim is nothing serious and most likely brought on by exhaustion. The [tour_country.GetAdjective] public is clearly disappointed by the decision, though well-wishes have been pouring into the royal residence since the announcement was made. It's unknown how long the king will require to recover, and in the case of the [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour, the only likely effect is that the lingering effects of the goodwill it generated won't last nearly as long as hoped."

entente.28.d: "A speech made by King [CAN_king_first_name] during his tour of [tour_country.GetNameDef] ended up in disarray when the king fared poorly against several hecklers in the crowd. He was overheard making some choice comments regarding the 'rudeness' of the hecklers, who turned out to be wounded veterans... a story which has been picked up in many [tour_country.GetAdjective] newspapers and resulted in King [CAN_king_first_name] being painted in a rather unfavorable light. It's not a scandal, at least, but it does ring a rather sour note as the king's [tour_country.GetAdjective] tour begins to wrap up."

Now we are left with allowing the trial to be played out with the full eyes of the public upon it, allowing King [CAN_king_first_name] the chance to intervene despite the damage to the monarchy, or intervening ourselves and handing the trial over to the British government-in-exile to be handled quietly, despite the outrage this would cause."

entente.54.d.2: "A recent law being considered by the [Root.GetAdjective] regarding the legal status of British expatriates in [Root.GetNameDef] is seeing heavy opposition by King [CAN_king_first_name] and his Privy Council - who are threatening to exert royal prerogative over the bill, which is their legal right even though it would come at a heavy price, considering how the Exiles are sometimes viewed by the [Root.GetAdjective] public. Some members of the government are desperate to find a compromise."
entente.54.d.3: "A dispute is slowly rearing its head within [Root.GetAdjective] military circles - namely who holds ultimate command over those British expatriates which are currently supported, and housed, within the [Root.GetAdjective] armed forces. Normally the Exiles and the [Root.GetAdjective] government would work together on these matters, but there are several sticking points which are refusing to go away and neither side appears ready to give on inch."
entente.54.d.4: "Several recent comments by the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the British Exiles in [Root.GetNameDef], have been taken as a sign of interference in the next [Root.GetAdjective] election, and some members of the [Root.GetAdjective] government have taken umbrage - to the point of going to the [Root.GetAdjective] press with complaints regarding what they see as the erosion of [Root.GetNameDef]'s sovereignty. It is feared that this conflict might very easily get out of hand."
entente.54.d.5: "The current influence of the British Exiles wielded within the [Root.GetAdjective] government has recently become a concern to opposition parties, some members of which have complained to the press - citing several examples where the king's Privy Council has overruled the government on matters they considered important, particularly if they believed it would lengthen the timetable for [Root.GetNameDef] reclaiming the Home Isles. The [Root.GetAdjective] press is eager to take up the challenge, and if the matter is not addressed soon it could lead to a larger streak of anti-British sentiment within the country."
entente.54.d.6: "Several prominent [Root.GetAdjective] businessmen have been complaining about the favoritism shown towards British Exiles in [Root.GetNameDef]. British industrialists, they say, are given preferential treatment on contracts and even allowed to skirt a number of legal requirements that ordinary [Root.GetAdjective] citizens must comply with. The complaints are gaining traction with the [Root.GetAdjective] press, and if not addressed could grow into a much more serious matter."
entente.54.d.7: "At least one major British industrialist, an Exile within [Root.GetNameDef] and member of King [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, has been loudly complaining at the number of what he calls 'arbitrary' restrictions placed on British Exiles when it comes to operating businesses within the country. 'We are doing the best we can,' he has said to the [Root.GetAdjective] press, 'and our help is surely needed for the war effort!' The government, meanwhile, claims it cannot afford to give the British Exiles an unfair advantage in business circles. With the king considering weighing in on the argument, it might be better to address sooner rather than later."

When King [CAN_king_first_name] recently questioned a decision of the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of his Privy Council, the result was an unexpected feud between the Exiles and their monarch, one that the [Root.GetAdjective] press has become aware of. The resulting war of words was short, but enough that both parties were damaged in the eyes of the  [Root.GetAdjective] public."
entente.55.a: "Let us hope that doesn't happen again..."
entente.56.t: "British Exile Fortunes Improve"
entente.56.d.1: "Several of the more prominent British industrialists currently living in [Root.GetNameDef], members of King [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, have been doing quite well as of late. Their investments in the [Root.GetAdjective] economy have been paying off handsomely, and thus their potential contribution towards the Exiles' overall influence has increased accordingly."
entente.56.d.2: "A wealthy family of British expatriates living in [Root.GetNameDef], having fled the Union of Britain shortly after its rise, has been seen in the company of King [CAN_king_first_name] much over recent months. Word has it that they have been admitted to the king's inner circle. If the rumours are true, the influence of the British Exiles is quickly improving."
entente.56.d.3: "One of the members of the King [CAN_king_first_name]'s Privy Council has become something of a darling in the [Root.GetAdjective] media as of late. Following his much-publicised marriage to a [Root.GetAdjective] actress, his speeches have been well-attended and many consider him an up-and-comer... indeed, even the [Root.GetAdjective] government seems to listen with rapt attention when he speaks."
entente.56.d.4: "A high-profile member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government died today. Much known for his public rants on the importance of [Root.GetAdjective] sovereignty in the face of the British presence, and a self-avowed Republican, his replacement is a much more moderate figure as well as a friend of King [CAN_king_first_name]. It is acknowledges in many circles that this is a boon for the British Exile cause in [Root.GetNameDef]."
entente.56.d.5: "Recent public sentiment in [Root.GetNameDef] has been turning towards the cause of the British Exiles, with the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] conducting several interviews on [Root.GetAdjective] national radio which have painted the Homecoming as a cause that cannot be given up on just yet. Numerous other expatriates have gone on the radio to regularly tell fond stories of the United Kingdom which once was in the weeks since, offering the Exiles even more public sympathy."
entente.56.d.6: "A prominent member of a British noble family currently living in [Root.GetNameDef] died recently, and his funeral gained much national attention - which included a last statement written by the man, explaining at length how his final wish had been to walk on the grounds of his family's ancestral estates one last time. The funeral has gained a great deal of public sympathy for the plight of the other British Exiles."
entente.56.d.7: "Several public policy meetings within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have ended in favor of the British Exiles recently, with prominent members of the king's Privy Council - and even King [CAN_king_first_name] himself - attending and making a very public show of being conciliatory and asking for [Root.GetAdjective] forbearance rather than demanding it. The effort has clearly gone over well, and the influence of the Privy Council in government circles is definitely improving."
entente.56.a: "Excellent"
entente.57.t: "British Exile Fortunes Worsen"
entente.57.d.1: "One of the most prominent British industrialists currently living in [Root.GetNameDef], a member of King [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, today had to declare bankruptcy after months of declining fortunes - and, rumour has it, a pending scandal of insider trading. While there is some sympathy for the industrialist, who was forced to leave a great deal of his fortune behind in the Home Isles, it does not change the fact that this negatively impacts the fortunes of the British Exiles a great deal."
entente.57.d.2: "One of the wealthy families of British expatriates living in [Root.GetNameDef], having fled the Union of Britain shortly after its rise, has noticeably cut its ties with King [CAN_king_first_name] in recent months following a very public dispute between the family's patriarch and the king. Seeing as the family was once considered an integral part of King [CAN_king_first_name]'s inner circle, the fortunes of the British Exiles have surely been hurt by this parting."
entente.57.d.3: "One of the more integral British ministers, a member of the king's Privy Council, has been caught up in an increasing series of scandals in the [Root.GetAdjective] media as of late, starting with the revelation of an affair and ending with accusations of bribery and nepotism. King [CAN_king_first_name] finally ended the matter by releasing him from his position today, though it is clear that the damage has already been done to the overall influence the British Exiles currently enjoy in [Root.GetNameDef]."
entente.57.d.4: "A high-profile member of the [Root.GetAdjective] government died today. Much known for this personal friendship with King [CAN_king_first_name], and having been among the first to welcome the British Exiles to [Root.GetNameDef], his replacement is a man more known for questioning British influence over the [Root.GetAdjective] government... and thus his loss is considered a severe blow to the cause of the British Exiles."
entente.57.d.5: "Recent public sentiment in [Root.GetNameDef] has been turning against the cause of the British Exiles, with the Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] having conducted a rather disastrous interview on [Root.GetAdjective] national radio which painted him as accusing the [Root.GetAdjective] people as being too 'lazy' to achieve victory against the Union of Britain. The Prime Minister later clarified strenuously that this was not what he meant, but the damage has already been done."
entente.57.d.6: "A speech made by a [Root.GetAdjective] politican, considered almost a nobody with little chance of reaching Parliament, gained national attention recently, no doubt due to the man's angry declaration that it was time to 'give the boot' to the British Exiles who he described as 'leeches dependent on [Root.GetAdjective] goodwill'. The attention would have quickly passed had King [CAN_king_first_name] not gone on record derisively insulting the man's 'lack of loyalty' - which provoked considerable anger and even more press coverage for months."
entente.57.d.7: "Several public policy meetings within the [Root.GetAdjective] government have ended recently with the British Exiles decidedly on the losing end. Prominent members of the king's Privy Council - and even King [CAN_king_first_name] himself - attended these meetings in an effort to aid their cause, but their presence ultimately did more harm than good, and was seen as an attempt to exert undue influence over [Root.GetNameDef]'s sovereignty. The Exiles have dutifully backed off from attendance in recent weeks, though it is clear the damage to public perception has already been done."
entente.57.a: "An unfortunate setback"
entente.58.t: "King [CAN_king_first_name] in Royal Scandal"
entente.58.d.1: "[Root.GetAdjective] newspapers are all abuzz with the details regarding King [CAN_king_first_name]'s latest alleged affair - this one with a British aristrocrat who is herself married. While both parties have denied the allegations, they have been photographed together on several occasions, and more than one source inside the royal household affirms that the rumours are completely true. The scandal has done considerable harm to King [CAN_king_first_name]'s popularity in [Root.GetNameDef], with the public declaring the king's conduct 'disgraceful'."
entente.58.d.2: "A member of the British royal family has been caught up in a royal scandal, with the headlines in [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers dominated by accusations of infidelity and deceit. While King [CAN_king_first_name] himself is not part of the scandal, it has not reflected well on the monarchy as a whole."
entente.58.d.3: "Recent revelations reported in a [Root.GetAdjective] national newspaper claim that King [CAN_king_first_name] used underhanded tactics to have a personal friend appointed to a plum political position within the [Root.GetAdjective] government. It has not helped matters that the king's friend has been overheard bragging about the favors he's received from the royal family, and all the recent attention has painted the monarchy in a particularly bad light."
entente.58.d.4: "A dispute within the British royal family has gone public, and although the conflict has been denied by all parties involved, [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers are filled with accounts supported by 'unnamed sources' inside the royal household. The [Root.GetAdjective] public, amused by the royal antics, has been glued to the headlines... and a stiff response from King [CAN_king_first_name] has likely done the monarchy more harm than good."
entente.58.d.5: "There has been a recent upsurge in anti-monarchist sentiment within [Root.GetNameDef], likely driven by syndicalist propaganda... but also not helped by newspaper accounts depicting the British royal family living in luxury and going about their day-to-day business as if nothing had changed. The newspaper stories were intended to promote the royals through an 'inside look' at their lifestyle, but appear to have had the opposite effect."
entente.58.d.6: "A public spat between King [CAN_king_first_name] and a rather prominent member of the British aristocracy has grown rather ugly. The aristocrat is said to have disavowed the monarchy, and his family is leaving [Root.GetNameDef] for an unknown destination... and the king is angry enough that he resorted to public comments in a [Root.GetAdjective] newspaper that called the family 'traitors' and worse. Public sentiment, however, seems to be that the entire affair reflects badly on the monarchy itself, rather than the aristocrat."
entente.58.d.7: "A recent interview with King [CAN_king_first_name] by a [Root.GetAdjective] publication has been received poorly, with several of the king's comments being perceived by the [Root.GetAdjective] public as 'out of touch'... particularly in light of the hardships suffered by the [Root.GetAdjective] people in recent years. The royal establishment has offered explanations and apologies, so the furor in the press is already dying down, but there is a general sentiment that the damage to the monarchy's reputation is already done."
entente.58.a: "Unfortunate"
entente.59.t: "Popularity of the Monarchy Rises"
entente.59.d.1: "A recent wedding within the greater royal family has captured the imagination of the [Root.GetAdjective] people. Perhaps the state of the world and the country is such that the public is looking for a distraction... and thus [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers have been reporting on the royal wedding with a certain amount of glee. Royalists have been happily waving the British flag, glad for a moment of respite."
entente.59.d.2: "A recent interview with King [CAN_king_first_name] by a [Root.GetAdjective] publication has been received positively. The article is considered a rare look inside the king's private life and his private thoughts, and the [Root.GetAdjective] public has responded enthusiastically."
entente.59.d.3: "King [CAN_king_first_name] completed a visit to a [Root.GetAdjective] military base this week, and while some have complained that it was a clear publicity stunt the pictures of the king shaking hands with excited, grateful soldiers has done wonders for the king's reputation. 'He really seems to care about us,' one soldier was remarked on saying. 'It makes me so proud to fight in his name.'"
entente.59.d.4: "King [CAN_king_first_name] recently took time out of his busy schedule to visit a [Root.GetAdjective] hospital, spending the afternoon meeting with the sick and the elderly. The visit was apparently not intended for publicity, with the king banning all cameras and reporters within, but word still got out afterwards. Most of those he visited gave the king a glowing review, saying that 'he is such a kind, caring man'. Some cynically suggest that it was a publicity stunt nevertheless, and - if so - it certainly seems to have done the trick for the king's reputation."
entente.59.d.5: "A recent death within the greater royal family - a young cousin of King [CAN_king_first_name]'s who has been serving with the [Root.GetAdjective] military - has gained a great deal of sympathy and attention from the [Root.GetAdjective] public. There is a sense among many that the royals are truly part of [Root.GetNameDef], willing to shed blood alongside [Root.GetAdjective] soldiers in pursuit of a common goal."
entente.59.d.6: "There has been a recent upswing in pro-monarchist sentiment within [Root.GetNameDef], despite - or perhaps because of - syndicalist propaganda. Some portrayals of the royal family within [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers have been depicting them as more down-to-earth and accessible, which is new territory for the traditionally aloof royals but appears to be working for them."
entente.59.d.7: "King [CAN_king_first_name] has been quite busy lately, making appearances at public openings, christening a new ship, attending church, sitting personally in his seat at the [Root.GetAdjective] parliament buildings... it has left the king quite exhausted, but it's had the effect of heightening the king's profile with the [Root.GetAdjective] people. For the moment, they appear quite fond of him."

entente.60.d.2: "King [CAN_king_first_name] has recently scaled back his public appearances and other duties, claiming the need to see to personal matters at his [Root.GetAdjective] estate. He told at least one reporter that there is nothing additional to be concerned over, though that hasn't stopped newspapers from speculating.""
entente.60.d.3: "Recent trouble within the royal family has led to King [CAN_king_first_name] scaling back his public appearances and governmental obligations, at least over the next few months.

'I saw him laughing and carrying on with the lords and ladies,' one witness stated. 'You'd think he didn't have a care in the world, that he may as well have been back in London.' Monarchists have been quick to defend the king, saying that his social appearances are quite normal, and should be welcomed after George V's long period of reclusiveness following the royal exile from the Home Isles."

King Edward, however, has recently made it his personal mission to greet them and make them feel welcome - at least for the time being. After several visits to camps in Ontario and Québec, the king held an elaborate garden party in Montreal to meet with more prominent Americans, the wealthy elites and celebrities who were able to come north immediately upon the outbreak of the civil war. There are some accusing the king of using this as yet another excuse to expand his social contacts, but it cannot be denied that most of the Americans were delighted by their treatment and treated the king with all the respect and ceremony anyone could desire."

The problem with the king's announcement, however, is that Constance Bennett, while of unclear religious affiliation, is a twice-divorced woman who is still legally married to her third husband, Henri de la Falaise.

As the nominal head of the Church of England, which does not permit the divorced to remarry with a living former spouse, this is clearly unacceptable for the king.

In his broadcast, the king avowed that his love for Constance was true - as is hers for him. Neither of them sees Constance's current marriage as an impediment, and what's more the king believes that in these 'modern times' the prohibition of the Church of England should alone keep him from serving his people in good faith. With the crisis shortly to reach a high point in Parliament, it remains to be seen whether the king's attempt to garner goodwill with the public will bear fruit."

With so much public pressure on the government, it seems impossible that the king could be expected to abdicate his throne now. As a result, a hastily-drawn up decree from the Church of England has been issued offering Constance Bennett clemency... when and if the royal wedding should take place.

A special decree for clemency has been issued by the Church of England, offering clemency for Constance Bennett when and if the wedding takes place.

entente.203.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] delegate is getting ready to speak at the Imperial Conference. On what area should he focus?"
entente.203.a: "Gaining assistance building our military"
entente.203.b: "We need to improve our economy"
entente.203.c: "Research should be our primary focus"
entente.204.t: "[From.GetAdjective] Delegate Speaks"
entente.204.d.adv_first: "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who gives a speech about how the [From.GetAdjective] military is in dire need of proper training and the upgrading of its firearms. Without such, he fears [From.GetNameDef] will be ill-equipped to assist in a distant war against the syndicalists, and requests that his fellow Dominions send whatever advisors they can to help."
entente.204.d.adv: "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who says that the [From.GetAdjective] military is also in need of assistance. While his nation is not alone in needing this help, he expressed his hope that [CAN.GetNameDef] would dig deep to spare the needed advisors... and that, in the future, [From.GetNameDef] would do the same."
entente.204.d.inv_first: "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who gives a speech about the dire need for investment and capital funds. The British Exiles have channeled so much of their funds into helping Canada through the Great Depression, he feels that perhaps some of it could be spared to assist the [Root.GetAdjective] economy."
entente.204.d.inv: "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who says that the [From.GetAdjective] economy is also in need of assistance. 'It seems we are all in dire straits,' he added with a chuckle, 'but I remain confident that there is investment enough to go around, and that the coming years will see all of us not only recovering but seeing rapid growth as we prepare for war.'"
entente.204.d.res_first: "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who spoke at length about the need for scientific investment. The economy needs modern science in order to not further stagnate, he said, while the military needs the most modern weapons. He asked that the Dominion send what research assistance they could to [From.GetNameDef], so they could better prepare for the war."
entente.204.d.res: "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who agreed that research was the best path for the Dominions. 'We will never best the syndicalists with sheer force,' he said, 'but rather with the technology to project our power overseas and a superiority of both technique and quality. This is how the Empire regains the Home Isles.'"
entente.204.a: "Hear, hear!"
entente.204.b: "Our best advisors are on their way"

entente.205.t: "End of the Conference"
entente.205.d: "The Imperial Conference of [GetYear] is now over. We can now focus on putting into practice the decisions that came about at the conference. There is hope that perhaps this marks the dawn of a new era for the Dominions and a strengthening of bonds, but only time will tell."
entente.205.a: "God Save the King!"
entente.210.t: "The Entente Air Training Scheme"
entente.210.d: "A proposal has been brought forward by the Foreign Minister and RCAF High Command to expand the Dominion Air Training Plan to include pilots from allied nations, dubbing it the 'Entente Air Training Scheme'. They say this would help strengthen our alliance politically as well as improving the quality of our pilots."
entente.210.a: "An excellent initiative!"
entente.211.t: "The Entente Air Training Scheme"
entente.211.d: "We've been invited by the Canadian Government to join in a large scale multinational air training programme on Canadian soil. It would strengthen our alliance and improve the skill of our pilots, but it may be seen as a concession to Canadian dominance of the Entente."
entente.211.a: "The Prairies are the perfect place for our pilots to train"
entente.211.b: "What do they have to teach us about flying?"
entente.212.t: "Entente Air Training Scheme Expands!"
entente.212.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has elected to join our air training programme. Already young [From.GetAdjective] pilots are arriving in the Prairies to take part, and more experienced air marshals have come with them to lend their own techniques and advice to our directors."
entente.212.a: "Excellent"
entente.213.t: "The Royal Atlantic Aeronautics Corporation"
entente.213.d: "The [CAN.GetAdjective] government has decided to fund the creation of a new company that will establish air links between our two countries by long-range float planes. The Royal Atlantic Aeronautics Corporation, or the RAAC, will operate from airfields in Bermuda, Andros, Jamaica, and Georgetown, and will offer passenger and cargo transportation. In addition to bringing Canada and the West Indies Federation closer together, it will undoubtedly spark aeronautics research in our country."

entente.250.t: "A Call to Arms"
entente.250.d: "With [invader.GetAdjective] forces having entered [Root.GetAdjective] territory, [CAN_king_full_name] today addressed the [Root.GetAdjective] public via radio with a grim message - he called for them to rise up and fight [invader.GetNameDef], to resist with the knowledge that this is the last stand of the British Empire. It is here in [Root.GetNameDef] that the question of freedom shall be decided. 'We must not fall,' he urged, and [Root.GetAdjective]s across the country have rallied to his side in this, their most desperate hour."

entente.300.d: "Many of our military experts believe our war against the Third Internationale will be a difficult one to win without some additional force applying pressure to the syndicalists. Fortunately, the experts in [From.GetNameDef] appear to agree. They have suggested that we meet with leaders from the [From.GetFactionName], now that they are also at war with [FRA.GetNameDef], and discuss the possibility we might work together. An alliance is out of the question, of course. What is the question is how much their co-operation is worth, considering they must fight the syndicalists anyhow."
entente.300.a: "Let us meet - we'll help them however we can"
entente.300.b: "We don't need their help"
entente.301.t: "Germany Refuses to Talk"
entente.301.d: "The Germans apparently believe they don't need our help, or they think talking is worth little since we have to fight the syndicalists anyhow. Whatever the reason, they have declined to meet with us to discuss co-operation. The idea is done before it began."
entente.301.a: "Ah well"
entente.302.t: "Germany Agrees to Talk"
entente.302.d: "Apparently the [From.GetAdjective] government believes as we do: co-operation between those with mutual enemies could prove beneficial. They will meet with us and fellow Entente leaders in [CAN.GetConferenceLocation] in one week's time."
entente.302.a: "Excellent"
entente.303.t: "The Entente and Reichspakt to Meet"
entente.303.d: "With both the Entente and the Reichspakt now at war with the Third Internationale, [ENT.GetNameDef] has called for a conference between their leaders in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] in order to discuss the possibility of co-operation... and [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed. While it is currently unclear how far such 'co-operation' would go, it seems worth the attempt. A representative from [This.GetNameDef] has been asked to attend."
entente.303.a: "We'll be there!"
entente.304.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference"
entente.304.d: "Leaders from the Entente and the Reichspakt gathered in [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] today in order to discuss the possibility of co-operation in the war against the Third Internationale. What this co-operation would consist of was not difficult to ascertain: military and naval access between all members, but - more importantly, for the Entente - the willingness on the part of the Reichspakt to stay out of both France and Great Britain once the war is done. This would allow for a swift return to Europe for the French and British exile governments, the ultimate goal of both, but now a single question hangs over the conference: would [GER.GetNameDef] even agree to such terms, and if so what would they ask in return?"
entente.304.a: "That's an excellent question"
entente.305.t: "Our Demands"
entente.305.d: "Staying out of both France and Great Britain in the peace conference following our future victory would mean [GER.GetNameDef] walking away from a long and costly war with little to show for it - and possibly two restored neighbors who we have vanquished previously and who have no reason to be fond of us. We cannot rely on their gratitude... so do we even consider the idea? What do we ask for in return?"
entente.305.t.return: "Do We Demand More?"
entente.305.d.return: "We have made it this far in the negotiations. Do we demand more concessions from the Entente, or have we reached a successful conclusion to the treaty?"
entente.305.a: "The French must publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine"
entente.305.b: "After they return to Paris, the French must join Mitteleuropa"
entente.305.c: "Their must recognize their former colonies in Africa and Asia as ours"
entente.305.e: "The British must renounce their claim to Northern Ireland"
entente.305.f: "Let us proceed to the treaty"
entente.305.g: "This discussion is pointless - we will never co-operate"
entente.306.t: "The Conference Goes Nowhere"
entente.306.d: "It appears it was barely worth the delegates even coming to [ENT.GetConferenceLocation]. While the Germans initially appeared willing to talk, the idea of completely staying out of both France and Great Britain didn't appeal. They claimed they would come out of a long and costly war with nothing to show for it, and none of the delegates could convince them anything the Entente would part with would be worth their while. The delegates from the Reichspakt are already returning home, and the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference has been deemed an utter failure."
entente.306.a: "They asked for too much!"
entente.306.b: "What a waste of time"
entente.307.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Alsace-Lorraine"
entente.307.d: "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their co-operation: that our government publicly renounce all future claims to Alsace-Lorraine. It's no surprise, really, and while there's nothing to stop us from re-claiming it after the war is done it will certainly appear like an illegitimate act. Our allies might not even support us in such an endeavour. Or perhaps the Germans just wish us to humiliate ourselves, to renounce something everyone knows is ours, for co-operation they probably need as much as we do."
entente.307.a: "We will never renounce Alsace-Lorraine!"
entente.307.b: "Very well, we agree"
entente.308.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.308.d: "Unsurprisingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegate has refused to give up their claim to Alsace-Lorraine - not even for the help they desperately need to return to the continent. They are too proud to give up a claim to something they cannot possibly hope to recover."
entente.308.a: "That's it for the conference, then"
entente.308.b: "We'll put this demand aside, for now"
entente.309.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Renounces Alsace-Lorraine"
entente.309.d: "Shockingly, the [NFA.GetAdjective] delegates have agreed - after much discussion with the Germans - to publicly renounce their claim to Alsace-Lorraine... if the Germans agree to the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference's treaty of co-operation. Considering the humilitation involved for the French to do so, it speaks much of how much they believe the treaty will help their return to the continent."
entente.309.a: "That is a relief"
entente.309.b: "A sweet admission on their part"
entente.309.c: "We have little choice"
entente.309.e: "How unexpected"
entente.310.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Mitteleuropa"
entente.310.d: "The German delegates at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference have come up with a demand in exchange for their co-operation: once we have returned to Paris, we will join Mitteleuropa - the German economic union. No doubt they wish to ensure they economically dominate us as we rebuild the country... though rebuilding would also go much more quickly with their assistance, it's true. Do we swallow this pill? It's not impossible that we could simply refuse once Paris is ours, though there will undoubtedly be consequences for doing so."
entente.310.a: "No, we will not surrender our independence"
entente.310.b: "Very well, we agree"
entente.311.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.311.d: "It seems the French will not even accept an offered hand of assistance, believing that membership in Mitteleuropa would allow us to economically dominate their country. And they are correct, of course. Surely they did not think we'd allow France to restore itself without us having some kind of control? Now we must ask ourselves whether this is worth ending the conference over."
entente.311.a: "It certainly is!"
entente.311.b: "No, we must press forward"
entente.312.t: "[NFA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees to Join Mitteleuropa"
entente.312.d: "The German delegation has demanded that [NFA.GetNameDef] agree to join Mitteleuropa, the German economic union, after Paris has been regained. Most present at the conference believe the Germans intend to have some form of economic control over the French as they rebuild their country, but possibly their offer is benign. Whatever the motivation, the French have agreed: when the time comes, they will join Mitteleuropa as requested."
entente.312.a: "Ah, good"
entente.312.b: "We'll believe it when we see it"
entente.312.c: "How humiliating"
entente.312.e: "Interesting"
entente.313.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Our Former Colonies"
entente.313.d: "The German delegates at the conference have a demand: essentially, that the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia which Germany gained after the First Weltkrieg be recognized as theirs. It's a symbolic move, perhaps, but the Germans would like to forestall any attempts on our part to re-establish our old empires in those regions once our power is regained. That we would even be prepared to go to war for our far-flung colonies is hard to imagine, but - even so - the idea of abandoning them completely does sting."
entente.313.a: "We will not abandon our colonies"
entente.313.b: "They have already been lost"
entente.314.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.314.d: "Interestingly, even though the British and French colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia have been lost for decades, now, [From.GetNameDef] has still refused to let them go. They would be 'abandoning' their former charges, as they see it, and will not relinquish even their moral claim to their colonies. Now we must decide whether this is enough to end the conference over. It is not, after all, like their refusal to recognize our colonies means they are any less ours."
entente.314.a: "Clearly they do not want co-operation enough"
entente.314.b: "It was a minor matter - let's move on"
entente.315.t: "German Colonies Recognized"
entente.315.d: "The French and British colonies gained by the Germans since the First Weltkrieg have been a sticking point - some annexed, others occupied 'temporarily' due to the lack of what the Germans claimed was a competent government to administer them. Now the Germans have demanded the colonies in Africa and Southeast Asia be officially recognized as theirs, forestalling future efforts to see them restored, and the Entente has agreed. It's a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that could prevent a great deal of conflict in the future."
entente.315.a: "It will be worth it"
entente.315.b: "Good"
entente.315.c: "Just get us to Paris"
entente.315.e: "Interesting"
entente.316.t: "The [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: Northern Ireland"
entente.316.d: "The German delegates have done something unexpected: after discussion with their Irish allies, they have presented a demand from us - the British government must renounce future claims to Northern Ireland. It is no small thing, effectively annulling the Acts of Union and breaking apart the United Kingdom once and for all. Considering the Irish were never planning on relinquishing the land without a war, perhaps it is best that the question be settled now."
entente.316.a: "We won't be forced into this, not by Germany"
entente.316.b: "So be it, we agree"
entente.317.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.317.d: "The British government has refused to give on the matter of Northern Ireland. Annulling the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, they say, is too large a matter to be decided here and now - the British delegates question whether they even have the authority to make such a promise. The Irish delegates are, of course, infuriated."
entente.317.a: "Too bad, we're done"
entente.317.b: "We won't end this for Ireland's sake"
entente.318.t: "The British Renounce Northern Ireland"
entente.318.d: "Today has caused much uproar at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: the German delegates, acting on behalf of their Irish allies, have demanded that the British renounce all claims to Northern Ireland. Even so it would annull the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, the British delegates have agreed to do so. They do not wish to war with the Irish, of all people, and while they have said the matter should in the end rest with the citizens of Northern Ireland themselves, they will not personally press British claims."
entente.318.a: "It had to be done"
entente.318.b: "I cannot believe they agreed to that"
entente.318.c: "Hah! I bet they renege!"
entente.318.e: "A difficult choice"
entente.318.f: "Astounding!"
entente.319.t: "Reichspakt and Entente Will Co-Operate"
entente.319.d: "After meeting in a conference in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation], representatives from the Entente and the Reichspakt have worked out a deal to co-operate in their war against the Third Internationale. The main terms of the deal involve both sides having military and naval access to the other, but - more importantly - [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed that, once the syndicalists have been beaten, they will take no territory in France or Great Britain and thus allow both the French and British exiled governments a swift return to Europe. Sources at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference say that the Germans elicited a host of promises from Entente leaders, though it remains to be seen whether - once the war is done, should they prove victorious - either side ultimately intends to keep them."
entente.319.a: "Hurrah!"
entente.319.b: "This will make things easier"
entente.319.c: "There is hope, after all"
entente.319.e: "A pointless exercise which will benefit no-one"
entente.319.f: "War makes for strange bedfellows, it seems"

entente.320.d.alsace: "Representatives of both the Entente and the Reichspakt met in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] this week, hoping to come to a working agreement on co-operation between both sides in their war against the Third Internationale. While there was initially progress, ultimately the German demand that [NFA.GetNameDef] renounce future claims to Alsace-Lorraine was refused and proved to be the breaking point. The French departed [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] in anger, with the Germans leaving soon afterwards, and the conference declared a disappointing failure. Their wars against the syndicalists will continue, but they will do so separately and while still eyeing the other side as an old and potentially future enemy."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_GEORGE_DESC:0 "The King-Emperor, as he styles himself still, has reigned over the British Empire for 26 years. He ascended in 1910 to the throne at the height of his Empire’s glory, an Empire on which the sun never set, but his reign oversaw the rapid decline of Britain’s power. The loss of the Weltkrieg to his own cousin, the loss of his youngest son, John, and the final devastating loss of Britain itself have combined to break much of George V’s spirit. His health also has worsened since the flight to Canada, which George privately refers to as “a frozen prison.” He has lost any interest in participating in domestic affairs, delegating such ceremonial duties as he may to his son, Prince Edward. He now lives on only for the return to Britain, but this prospect grows dimmer by the day."
POLITICS_EDWARD_DESC:0 "After the death of his father, King-Emperor George V, Edward of Windsor was crowned in a lavish ceremony in Ottawa. The young monarch, notably solemn upon his enthronement, inherited an Empire undoubtedly a shadow of its former glory, and a kingdom occupied by syndicalist revolutionaries. Undeterred, King Edward maintains, above all else, the desire that the banner of the United Kingdom again proudly fly above the British Isles."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC:0 "Prince Albert of Windsor, younger Brother of British king Edward VIII, has been appointed Governor-General of Canada. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Canadians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Canadian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With Edward occupied with the reconstruction of the recently reconquered Britain, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Canada is properly governed."

The skills and techniques we learn could also apply well to general air doctrines."
CAN_air_training_plan_idea:0 "Entente Air Training Plan"
CAN_air_training_plan_idea_desc:0 "Air training is almost as complex as the air combat it trains the pilots for.

Sharing this training with our Entente allies only helps to that end."

CAN_refugee_crisis_sec:0 "American Refugees Under Guard"
CAN_refugee_crisis_sec_desc:0 "It means bolstering the numbers in provincial police forces, men who could otherwise be soldiers, but this will keep the camps under close guard and prevent further problems."
CAN_refugee_crisis_help:0 "American Refugees Aided"
CAN_refugee_crisis_help_desc:0 "The camps will always be a source of problems for us, but we've gone out of our way to ensure the refugees are treated and fed well. Hopefully the war will be over soon."

CAN_claim_alaska_desc:0 "The border between Canada and Alaska was made in the favor of Americans, thanks to an interest by the British government of the time in improving relations with the United States. Canadian interests were considered of secondary importance. Since the treaty was approved by a government we are no longer subservient to, we reject the arbitration and the border. Canada has a natural claim to Alaska, and it should have been ours to begin with."
CAN_core_alaska:0 "Alaska is Canadian Land"

### Events ###
canada.1.t:0 "The Current Situation"
canada.1.d:0 "It has been ten years since the collapse of the United Kingdom in 1926 and, in that time, the king, the remnants of the British government, and over a million of the Empire's best and brightest (and wealthiest) have fled to Canada... with the clear expectation that an invasion would soon be launched to take back the Home Isles from the syndicalist upstarts. It quickly became evident, however, that the syndicalist position was stronger than anticipated. Early forays were rebuked, and the last decade has seen the Union of Britain become solidified and entrenched, to the point where we have had to adopt the Blue Ensign as the Red Ensign was too similar to the Unions. The Exiles, as they're called in Canada, have meanwhile been left adrift, determined to take back their homeland but facing the political reality that this may never happen."
canada.1.a:0 "One day soon, though!"
canada.2.d:0 "While initially welcomed with open arms by Canadians, the notion this might be a long-term arrangement has been an increasingly unpleasant one. Fingers were pointed and blame laid on those who were deemed responsible for the collapse and the subsequent inability to rectify matters, and resentment against Exiles who were seen as 'a higher class' in the Dominion as well as above the law has been growing. In 1931, a year after their election, the minority government of R.B. Bennett and his Conservatives collapsed, to be replaced by Mackenzie King and the Liberals with a promised focus on Canadian sovereignty and keeping the British government-in-exile at arm's length rather than acting as if nothing had changed in the relationship."
canada.2.a:0 "Only to be expected"
canada.3.d:0 "This year, Mackenzie King and the Liberals are nearing the end of their term and, on top of the tribulations of the Great Depression, there is growing criticism that little progress has been made in resolving the political situation. George V lies on his deathbed, charging the Exiles and the Conservatives with bringing the Empire 'back on track'. His government clashes often with the Liberals, and the Canadian public appears split between those who would see matters come to a head and those who would prefer to abandon their ties to the crown and the French exiles in Africa both. The upcoming election appears as if it will be the most divisive in Canadian history."

canada.4.d:0 "In the last several months, King George has been plagued by illness and his health has been failing. This fact has been kept from the public, to keep up appearances while treatments were attempted, but it seems all was for naught. At 11.55 p.m. yesterday, the king died following a bout of severe fever. His eldest son and heir apparent, Prince Edward, has inherited the throne as Edward VIII and is expected to address the nation within the month.

Instead, royal planners held an elaborate ceremony in Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa's largest Anglican church. There the Archbishop of Canterbury, himself a British exile, performed the rites as expected by tradition, with a throng of media paying close attention to every move. Rather than making his first public appearance afterwards on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, King Edward instead appeared on the balcony of Rideau Hall, the official royal residence, where he was greeted by a throng of entusiastic Canadians."

His Privy Council is, of course, urging him to promote the cause of retaking the Home Isles. R.B. Bennett, the leader of the Conservative Party and the Official Opposition, suggests that he use his platform to endorse them for the upcoming election, saying that will serve the cause of war far better. Others, meanwhile, suggest that supporting the current Prime Minister and government will go a long way to mending fences and maintaining stability... though it could also be seen as a tacit endorsement of the Liberal Party's position."

From Vancouver to St. John, from Toronto to the Arctic, Canadians everywhere buzz with excitement after hearing a charismatic and forceful speech celebrating Canadian democracy. In it, King Edward specifically called out the long service of R.B. Bennett and the Conservative Party, and suggested Canadians - and indeed the entire Entente - would be well-served to have them leading the country into the next war. Bennett, in turn, publicly thanked the king and called on all his fellow Canadians to look on this as the turning a new page and a chance to follow a young and vital king to victory at last."

Recently, however, there have been indications that Prime Minister Austen Chamberlain's time is up. Many Exiles see him as partly responsible for the loss of the Home Isles, and have been urging King Edward to replace him. We could push the king to appoint a more moderate candidate, however - someone more likely to work with the Canadian government. We could also urge the king to call for an election among the Exiles in Canada, though how much of a legal mandate that would give the new Prime Minister is questionable. Still, it's more democratic than an appointee."

Since King Edward's ascension, the appointments of Exiles has continued... to the point where the Senate is often referred to as 'the Canadian House of Lords'. Many members of the government are saying the time has come to insist on Senate Reform, passing a law requiring Senatorial appointments be confirmed by the House of Commons. Considering the Senate has the power to reject bills, this could result in a showdown with the king... unless he decides that it is better not to anger the government of his host country while in exile."

The king's stance appears to be that 'in these troubling times' he cannot relinquish his royal prerogatives... so that likely means no reform will be possible. The king's actions have not endeared him with the Canadian public, however, as newspapers across the country have painted the king's actions as contemptuous of Canadian sovereignty and democracy."
canada.10.a:0 "Well, we tried"
canada.11.t:0 "Senate Reform Bill Passes"
canada.11.d:0 "The Senate has begrudgingly passed the reform bill sent to them by the House of Commons, with King [CAN_king_first_name] reportedly having no comment on the matter. It is clear that Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM], head of the British Exiles in Canada, advised the king that a confrontation with the Canadian government at this time would prove imprudent. The first vote in the House of Commons on the next Senate appointee is due within weeks, and the entire country is eagerly anticipating the first Canadian-born appointee in over a decade."
canada.11.a:0 "Excellent"
canada.12.t:0 "Chief of the RCN"
canada.12.d:0 "A heated discussion has occurred within the Canadian government regarding who to formally appoint as the head of the RCN. Until now, the British fleet-in-exile has operated more or less independently of the Canadian chain of command, but everyone agrees this cannot continue. The British Exiles are adamant on putting Sir Roger Backhouse in the fleet, since they say it IS their fleet. Ministers suggest Canadian admiral Percy Nelles is more the man for the job, and will do a better job of co-ordinating the two forces."

canada.13.d:0 "The time has come to select the man who will lead both the British and Canadian forces to victory on the ground. King [CAN_king_first_name] and Prime Minister [GetBritishExilePM] have all but anointed J.F.C. 'Boney' Fuller with the title, convinced his ideas on mechanizing the military is exactly the kind of ideas we need. They both seem to have forgotten, however, that the majority of lives on the line will be Canadian. Several miniters have pointed out that Georges Vanier is more than qualified, and will keep the British from throwing away Canadian lives in another Gallipoli."

canada.14.d:0 "With the war against the syndicalists now upon us, King [CAN_king_first_name] is pressuring the Prime Minister to make a choice as to who will lead the Canadian forces overall. We must choose wisely. The British commanders are skilled, and will pelase the king as he wants to see one of his own in charge of the invasion. The Canadian commanders, however, will be far more popular back home."

With only a brief interruption at the first game in Detroit, with demonstrators by the Socialist Party of America disrupting proceedings outside the stadium, the series has gone off without a hitch and captivated audiences in both countries.

While the Canadian economy isn't as tied to the German markets as some, the ripples have been felt throughout the world... particularly in the United States, a market we are particularly dependent upon. This setback is difficult to take, though Prime Minister King has assured the country, 'We will make it through this, just as we have the dark years prior! Now is the time for us to join together and work as we never have before!'"

canada.24.t:0 "Writ of Election Issued"
canada.24.d:0 "The House of Commons has issued the writ of election, calling for general elections to be held in October of this year. Both the Liberals and the Conservatives have already begun campaigning, and the general sentiment is that this election will be an important one - does the country push hard towards a confrontation with the Union of Britain, or does it take a more cautious approach and focus on building up Canada's strength and that of the other Dominions? The Liberals favor the latter, while the Conservatives and the British Exiles heavily favor the former."

canada.25.t:0 "Bennett Accuses Liberals of Inaction"
canada.25.d:0 "With the effects of Black Monday still being felt in Canada, R.B. Bennett has taken the offensive and accused Mackenzie King and the Liberals of gross inaction - not only on the economic management of the country, but on what he suggests is an 'inevitable war that will determine the fate not only of Canada but the entire world'. Canada, he says, should be pushing hard for the coming war, and suggests that if it fails to do so 'the Entente shall be caught once again in a weak and indefensible position'. Considering the large crowd he attracted at his latest speech in Halifax, there are a large number of Canadians who agree with him."

canada.26.d:0 "The recently-formed Co-operative Commonwealth Federation party, led by J.S. Woodsworth, has been making large gains in the polls as Woodsworth speaks to groups of unemployed labourers and factory workers across the country. The party's democratic socialist platform has resulted in accusations of it being funded and run by syndicalist sympathizers, but its message of alleviating the suffering of farmers and workers under capitalism has hit a chord even so. Regardless, its popularity seems most concentrated in Western Canada, and the idea it might have a chance at forming a government is remote."
canada.26.a:0 "Democratic socialism? In the True North?"
canada.27.t:0 "The Conscription Debate Begins"
canada.27.d:0 "As expected, the most contentious issue in the election is proving to be that of conscription. Both the Liberals and Conservatives have proposed a bill that has become known as C-7, which would shape our preparations for war over the coming years. Whether Bill C-7 includes conscription, however, is the key element. French-Canadians in Québec are, in particular, vehemently opposed to the idea of general conscription forcing them to fight in a 'British war', and thus Liberal promises of not implementing it have seen them make great gains in that province. Conservatives, meanwhile, say that Canada doesn't have the manpower to fight any war without conscription. The war, when it comes, means conscription sooner or later - and they say, for all our sakes, it should be sooner."
canada.27.a:0 "This could get ugly"
canada.28.t:0 "Demonstration at King Speech"
canada.28.d:0 "A campaign stop by Mackenzie King in Toronto was marred today when it was met by a large demonstration organized by the Orange Order of Canada. The Order, which celebrates Canadian ties with the British Empire and has been capaigning strenuously for greater action against the Union of Britain, has declared the Liberal 'no conscription' position as an outrage that threatens the very survival of the Empire. The raucous chanting and shouting prevented King from continuing the speech, and altercations between Liberal supporters and the Orange Order almost ended up in a riot before the police were finally called in to intervene."

canada.29.d:0 "Coming off a campaign based on Québecois dissatisfaction with the economic downturn and the threat of national conscription, Maurice Duplessis and the Union Nationale have won a majority government in the Québec provincial elections. Duplessis has sworn to fight any plan to enact conscription, and there are even threats of calling for a referendum on the future of Québec in Confederation should that happen. This is a clear sign of just how serious the divisions between English Canadians and French Canadians have become, now that the split of opinion on Canada's role in the coming war is so sharp."
canada.29.a:0 "This is not good"
canada.30.t:0 "March Against Conscription"
canada.30.d:0 "A giant march against Bill C-7 and the prospect of national conscription has taken place in both Montreal and Québec City, with smaller marches taking place in Ottawa and Vancouver. Opposition to conscription is beginning to hit a head, with many of the signs in the marches declaring 'Exiles Get Out!' and 'No War For Canada!' in either English or French. Members of the Conservative party have openly suggested the marches are being organized by the Union of Britain in order to destabilize the Entente, but Mackenzie King and the Liberals have treated them seriously and doubled-down on the party's opposition to widespread conscription."
canada.30.a:0 "Goodness!"
canada.31.t:0 "Bennett Assaults Reporter"
canada.31.d:0 "At a campaign stop in Hamilton, R.B. Bennett was aggressively questioned by a French-Canadian reporter over the Conservative plans for conscription, outright implying that the Conservatives intended to send French Canadians into the front lines in order to eliminate their 'threat to Anglophone domination'. Unsurprisingly, the tempestuous Bennett's response was to attack the man, causing a near-riot that dominated the newspapers for days."
canada.31.a:0 "He's willing to fight, and that's a good thing!"
canada.31.b:0 "Bennett is an embarrassment"
canada.32.t:0 "Rise of the Nationalist Party"
canada.32.d:0 "The main competition for the Liberals among those opposed to conscription appears to have become the Nationalist Party of Canada, led by Henry Herbert Stevens. The Nationalist Party's platform began as republican and anti-monarchist, but has evolved into a stance which would see Canada pulled out of the Entente entirely. Stevens is expected to win in his British Columbia riding, but so far has been unable to gain traction in Québec where the party could do more than eat at the Liberal domination there."
canada.32.a:0 "Interesting"
canada.33.t:0 "King Edward Comments on War"
canada.33.d:0 "King Edward recently made the rounds in Canadian newspapers, commenting on the war with [war_country.GetNameDef] and saying, 'This won't be the end of it. The world order established after the end of the Great War is now falling apart, and the Empire must be ready. We cannot put our heads in the ground and wish things were other than they are, for one way or another the wars overseas will come to our shores.' The king's comments were seen as tacit support for R.B. Bennett and the Conservatives, and many Canadians are reluctantly agreeing."

canada.34.d:0 "The economic relief camps set up by the government have been the source of considerable criticism as of late, mainly due to the low rate of pay received by the workers as well as their living conditions. The unemployed men working in the camps say that they cannot earn enough money to return to their former lives and get regular jobs, forcing them to remain in the camps indefinitely. Anger has been rising, and there are demands for the government to do something about it."

The service proved invaluable in promoting loyalty throughout the British Empire, and also as a tool to marginalise syndicalism within our borders. There have been calls to install Reith as the head of the new Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, in order to begin a propaganda campaign against more moderate socialists in the country. Others have suggested using Reith to employ propaganda with a more external focus, to prepare our people for the coming fight against syndicalism."

Canada has proven itself to be far more than a colony, far more capable and more dutiful than we could possibly have hoped. It was a safe harbour, and for many of us it was home.' He asked that Canadians consider carefully before they chartered a destiny away from the Commonwealth, though in added that - should they choose to leave - the British would be morally bound to respect their collective decision and merely hope that the two countries could continue a long and fruitful friendship."

However, the King is thinking that instead of giving all governance back to a native Icelandic government, we could perhaps install a monarch in Iceland in order to gain lawful control over the island for decades to come. The candidate to the created Icelandic throne would be Edward VIII’s cousin, Princess Alexandra, who would be crowned Queen of the island and given say over it’s affairs alongside a civilian Prime Minister.\n\nBut of course who is to say that the king must give the throne to anyone else but himself, and so if we decide the previous two options of natives and another member of the Windsors are unsatisfactory for leading Iceland, why not give King Edward the reins to do as he pleases?"

Every single faction in the turbulent American political landscape have abandoned their feuds, instead focusing their total efforts on undermining our presence.

entente.204.d.res_first:0 "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who spoke at length about the need for scientific investment. The economy needs modern science in order to not further stagnate, he said, while the military needs the most modern weapons. He asked that the Dominion send what research assistance they could to [From.GetNameDef], so they could better prepare for the war."
entente.204.d.res:0 "The next to speak is the delegate from [From.GetNameDef], who agreed that research was the best path for the Dominions.

They would be 'abandoning' their former charges, as they see it, and will not relinquish even their moral claim to their colonies. Now we must decide whether this is enough to end the conference over. It is not, after all, like their refusal to recognize our colonies means they are any less ours."

It's a symbolic gesture, perhaps, but one that could prevent a great deal of conflict in the future."

It is no small thing, effectively annulling the Acts of Union and breaking apart the United Kingdom once and for all. Considering the Irish were never planning on relinquishing the land without a war, perhaps it is best that the question be settled now."
entente.316.a:0 "We won't be forced into this, not by Germany"
entente.316.b:0 "So be it, we agree"
entente.317.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
entente.317.d:0 "The British government has refused to give on the matter of Northern Ireland. Annulling the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, they say, is too large a matter to be decided here and now - the British delegates question whether they even have the authority to make such a promise. The Irish delegates are, of course, infuriated."
entente.317.a:0 "Too bad, we're done"
entente.317.b:0 "We won't end this for Ireland's sake"
entente.318.t:0 "The British Renounce Northern Ireland"
entente.318.d:0 "Today has caused much uproar at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference: the German delegates, acting on behalf of their Irish allies, have demanded that the British renounce all claims to Northern Ireland. Even so it would annull the Acts of Union which created the United Kingdom, the British delegates have agreed to do so. They do not wish to war with the Irish, of all people, and while they have said the matter should in the end rest with the citizens of Northern Ireland themselves, they will not personally press British claims."
entente.318.a:0 "It had to be done"
entente.318.b:0 "I cannot believe they agreed to that"
entente.318.c:0 "Hah! I bet they renege!"
entente.318.e:0 "A difficult choice"
entente.318.f:0 "Astounding!"
entente.319.t:0 "Reichspakt and Entente Will Co-Operate"
entente.319.d:0 "After meeting in a conference in the [ENT.GetAdjective] city of [ENT.GetConferenceLocation], representatives from the Entente and the Reichspakt have worked out a deal to co-operate in their war against the Third Internationale. The main terms of the deal involve both sides having military and naval access to the other, but - more importantly - [GER.GetNameDef] has agreed that, once the syndicalists have been beaten, they will take no territory in France or Great Britain and thus allow both the French and British exiled governments a swift return to Europe. Sources at the [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] Conference say that the Germans elicited a host of promises from Entente leaders, though it remains to be seen whether - once the war is done, should they prove victorious - either side ultimately intends to keep them."
entente.319.a:0 "Hurrah!"
entente.319.b:0 "This will make things easier"
entente.319.c:0 "There is hope, after all"
entente.319.e:0 "A pointless exercise which will benefit no-one"
entente.319.f:0 "War makes for strange bedfellows, it seems"

While there was initially progress, ultimately the German demand that [NFA.GetNameDef] renounce future claims to Alsace-Lorraine was refused and proved to be the breaking point. The French departed [ENT.GetConferenceLocation] in anger, with the Germans leaving soon afterwards, and the conference declared a disappointing failure. Their wars against the syndicalists will continue, but they will do so separately and while still eyeing the other side as an old and potentially future enemy."

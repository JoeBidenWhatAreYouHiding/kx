# Events #

turkestan_events.1.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Our Submission"
turkestan_events.1.d: "The Government of [FROM.GetNameDef], which recently confirmed that it would be in their interests and in the interests of all the peoples of Turkestan to unite into a single country, has put forward a number of demands to our government, including the deployment of troops, compliance with their decrees, and probably new taxes. Confident in their growing strength, they actually demand submission. Of course, there is always an opportunity to abandon these unthinkable demands, although most likely it will mean war."
turkestan_events.1.a: "We acquiesce to their demands."
turkestan_events.1.b: "We stand defiant!"
turkestan_events.1.c: "We are the legitimate government of Turkestan!"

turkestan_events.2.t: "[FROM.GetName] Submits to Our Authority"
turkestan_events.2.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to join our ranks, although so far under the condition of some kind of autonomy. In doing so, they pledged to bring their laws into line with ours, provide troops for our wars, and ensure further coordination in national affairs. However, in turn, in practice they retained most of their old government.Further integration will have to be discussed another time, but for now, although the status quo remains."
turkestan_events.2.a: "We are magnanimous rulers."

turkestan_events.3.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Yield!"
turkestan_events.3.d: "Despite our efforts to resolve this issue peacefully, [FROM.GetLeader] officially abandoned our efforts to promote national unity and began mobilizing units [FROM.GetAdjective] for a show of force to try to stop us. Their refusal to integrate can only mean one thing - it is necessary to immediately send troops to their land and subjugate this government, which has not been in the interests of the Turks for a long time!"
turkestan_events.3.a: "Let us begin a buildup at the border."
turkestan_events.3.b: "The invasion begins now!"

turkestan_events.7.t: "[FROM.GetName] Invites us to Join Ranks"
turkestan_events.7.d: "Despite the fact that since the time of Genghis Khan, Khan Uzbek and their successors, Turkestan has become more and more divided, there were many people throughout the country who shared a common vision of the country's future. These kindred spirits were often separated by mountains and rivers and forced to fight their own regional battles for dominance.\n\n[FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has identified our [ROOT.GetRulingParty] as an ally in their quest to liberate the Turks. [ROOT.GetLeader] has been invited to join forces, bringing Turkestan ever closer to unification without firing a shot."
turkestan_events.7.a: "We accept wholeheartedly."
turkestan_events.7.b: "We are not affiliated with one another."

turkestan_events.8.t: "[FROM.GetName] Joins our Ranks!"
turkestan_events.8.d: "Thanks in part to the similar roots between [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have remained aligned over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to begin coordinating our efforts at unification, peacefully bringing [FROM.GetNameDef] into the [ROOT.GetAdjective] fold.\n\nWith any luck, our combined forces will be sufficient to bring about successful national liberation from the chaos and strife that has engulfed it. With momentum on our side, the combined might of our forces will continue onwards to victory!"
turkestan_events.8.a: "One cause for one nation."

turkestan_events.9.t: "[FROM.GetName] Denies our Alliance!"
turkestan_events.9.d: "Despite the similar roots of the [FROM.GetRulingParty] and our own [ROOT.GetRulingParty], it appears that our goals have diverged over the years. [FROM.GetLeader] of [FROM.GetNameDef] has denied our efforts at peacefully unifying our cause against mutual enemies, instead electing to go their own route.\n\nThis treason can only be explained by their own selfishness and inability to think beyond their own interests."
turkestan_events.9.a: "[FROM.GetAdjective] traitors ought to at least stay out of our way."

turkestan_events.10.t: "[FROM.GetName] Invades [ALO.GetNameDefCap]"
turkestan_events.10.d: "Today, the [FROM.GetAdjective] troops have crossed the borders with our [ALO.GetAdjective] autonomy, which effectively means that they have invaded our sovereign territory. We have no other choice but to immediately respond!"
turkestan_events.10.a: "They will be destroyed for challenging us!"

turkestan_events.11.t: "[FROM.GetName] Breaks Free!"
turkestan_events.11.d: "Yesterday, the previous government of [FROM.GetNameDef] was overthrown and now [FROM.GetLeader] has taken charge. During the chaos, we have lost control over their government."
turkestan_events.11.a: "Approach the new government."
turkestan_events.11.b: "Attack them!"

turkestan_events.50.t: "The New Capital"
turkestan_events.50.d: "With the unification of Turkestan, it is finally time to set the permanent seat of the new central government. Tashkent would be the natural choice, an ancient city that has been an administrative center during the Tsarist Era, and a rapidly developing industrial and financial urban area.\n\nThe other choice is to keep all the bureaucracy in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], as a symbol of our rule."
turkestan_events.50.a: "Tashkent."
turkestan_events.50.b: "Stay in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]."

turkestan_events.185.t: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] Offer"
turkestan_events.185.d: "We have received a formal request from the [FROM.GetAdjective] Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in which, expressing sympathy for our government and acknowledging the shared objectives of fostering peace and cooperation between our nations, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government proposes to reinstate its protectorate over our country with the aim of safeguarding our shared interests.\n\nCertainly, this proposal implies relinquishing all sovereignty in matters of external relations and, to some extent, internal ones. However, perhaps this is a course of action that suits our interests? Regardless, although the delegation did not explicitly state it, the alternative to this proposal appears to be the imposition of military force and the specter of conflict."
turkestan_events.185.a: "Reject their foolish offer!"
turkestan_events.185.b: "Submit. We are no match for their military might."

turkestan_events.186.t: "Protectorate Over [FROM.GetNonIdeologyName]"
turkestan_events.186.d: "Greetings from [FROM.Capital.GetName]! The diplomatic efforts of our esteemed Foreign Minister have borne fruit, as the government of [FROM.GetName] has consented to voluntarily place itself under our protection. Clearly, an unpalatable alternative would have been military intervention on their territory, with the subsequent incorporation into our ranks. It is commendable that they possess the fortitude to acknowledge our unyielding strength."
turkestan_events.186.a: "They have sense."

turkestan_events.187.t: "When Diplomacy Proves Futile..."
turkestan_events.187.d: "Despite the best efforts of our Foreign Minister, the government of [FROM.GetName] he was unable to convince the peaceful restoration of our state's protectorate over their feeble semi-feudal entity. It appears that we will have to bring them into our fold by force after all."
turkestan_events.187.a: "Let's show them our teeth!"

turkestan_events.199.t: "Results of Preparation"
turkestan_events.199.d: "Few suspected that this would be the way that the nations of Central Asia would descend into the fires of war - but it matters little now that the present storm of violence has seized the region. We have spent years preparing for a conflict on our doorstep, but even with our best effort we are restricted by the natural limitations of our coffers and culture. For generations, the military of our realm has been characterised more by widespread corruption, as nepotism and outright bribery determined the composition of our leadership, and the mismanagement of our rank and file is counteracted only by their loyalty to their tribal brethren. Any attempts to upturn this stagnation has been met with incredible resistance and, in some cases, outright violence, as the rank and file - spurred on by local tribal headsmen - lash out against any attempts to exert state control over their military position.\n\nOf course, it would have been quite easy to give up on these efforts, shelving them for a far flung future where perhaps we would have had more resources or political willpower to reform. However far we came along, however, the moment of reckoning has come! Many months of buildup have led to this very moment - Central Asia is ablaze, consumed by a battle which will test the very strength of the people and the state. We have worked long and hard to prepare for this moment, and only now do we know that our efforts have resulted in..."
turkestan_events.199.a: "...complete failure!"
turkestan_events.199.b: "...a couple of successes, surrounded by a sea of failure."
turkestan_events.199.c: "...only a few successful reforms."
turkestan_events.199.e: "...some minor successes."
turkestan_events.199.f: "...moderately successful reforms!"
turkestan_events.199.g: "...quality reforms in most areas!"
turkestan_events.199.h: "...sweeping and comprehensive reforms!"

turkestan_events.200.t: "Stalemate in the Central Asia War"
turkestan_events.200.d: "The situation in Central Asia has become untenable. The great [ROOT.GetAdjective] army has become bogged down in the deserts, steppes, and highlands of this accursed hellhole, beset on all sides by bandit raiders. Worse yet, the world is laughing at our misery! While our domestic newsprint has reported faithfully from the frontline, detailing our countless victories and valiant struggles, Ottoman journalists have embedded themselves with our enemies, painting a picture of a courageous resistance at the hands of a romantic cadre of Central Asian warriors. Their tall tales, detailing our supposed incompetence and failures have been disseminated all across the world, additionally finding their way into the homes of our own citizens, who have increasingly demanded answers and accountability among our military, including frequent parallels drawn to the 1925 putsch.\n\nWith political will decidedly turned against the continuation of our intervention into Central Asia, we have been forced to come to the negotiating table with the bandit states facing us. We cannot afford to weaken our domestic political situation and allow for the growth of international pressure against our government, especially not for the negligible gains a drawn out victory of attrition would net us. The answer is clear, though difficult to swallow - we must withdraw from the region fully, lest the endless sinkhole of steppe warfare consumes our government whole."
turkestan_events.200.a: "A sad day for Russia."

turkestan_misc.100.t: "Record-Breaking Gold Extraction At the Mines!"
turkestan_misc.100.d: "[ROOT.GetNameDefCap], with its arid landscapes, has long been cognizant of its immense natural riches, particularly the rich gold deposits concealed beneath its soil. In the latter half of the 19th century, these resources caught the attention of Russia, spurring substantial foreign investment in the development of mining infrastructure.\n\nWhile this influx of capital enriched Russian enterprises and state coffers, it had a limited impact on the local economy, which primarily benefited from labor-intensive employment and environmental damage. However, with the recent investment in mining operations, we now face an abundance of gold production. How should we best utilize this opportunity?"
turkestan_misc.100.a: "Sell it abroad, decide later what to do with profits."
turkestan_misc.100.b: "Invest this capital in the domestic sector."
turkestan_misc.100.c: "A new military facility will augment our military might."

turkestan_misc.1.t: "The Land of Nomads"
turkestan_misc.1.d: ""

turkestan_misc.200.t: "Mujahideen Kurbashi Arrives"
turkestan_misc.200.d: "After the defeat of the Mujahideen in his homeland, one of their Kushbegi and his loyalists crossed the border and came to us to lead our armed detachments"
turkestan_misc.200.a: "Great!"
turkestan_misc.200.b: "Send them away!"

turkestan_misc.201.t: "Bukharan Emir In Exile"
turkestan_misc.201.d: "After the abolition of monarchy in the Emirate of Bukhara, Mohammed Alim Khan, its Emir, was forced to exile in our country. Seems we have nothing to do, but to accept him gratefully for now."
turkestan_misc.201.a: "The last Emir of Bukhara?"

turkestan_misc.215.t: "[FROM.GetName] Buys Equipment"
turkestan_misc.215.d: "Today we were approached by the [FROM.GetAdjective] ministry of Defense, which asked us for supplies of equipment in order to help them modernize their obsolete Armed Forces. The deal was successful and we received our payment in time."
turkestan_misc.215.a: "Great!"
turkestan_misc.215.b: "Break the deal!"

turkestan_misc.216.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
turkestan_misc.216.d: "Unfortunately for us, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to establish an arms supply with us!"
turkestan_misc.216.a: "Sad..."

turkestan_misc.217.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
turkestan_misc.217.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to establish an arms supply with us!"
turkestan_misc.217.a: "Great!"

### Ideas ###
central_asia_preparation_level_1: "Failure of the Preparation Campaign"
central_asia_preparation_level_1_desc: "Like the exotic flightless birds of faraway lands, we have determined to stick our heads deep within the sands, ignoring the urgent need for reform within our military. Whether it be through government mismanagement and inaction, or active backlash from the conservative and traditional elements of our nation, the reforms proposed in last years have failed entirely, leading to an assortment of bandits and militias which can barely be called an army, more likely to rob our own populace than face an enemy in battle."
central_asia_preparation_level_2: "Preparation Campaign Subverted"
central_asia_preparation_level_2_desc: "In the ancient persian tale of the scorpion and the turtle, even as the turtle works diligently in the service of itself and its friend the scorpion, the scorpion cannot help but do its best to kill them both. Such is the nature of the scorpion, and such is also the nature of the Tribal headman and Basmachi warlord, who knows nothing more than to hoard power personally and to resist any attempt to reform our military into a modern fighting force. By stifling our attempts to reform our army, these men have secured their positions as headsmen, all while dooming themselves and their nations to foreign conquest and failure."
central_asia_preparation_level_3: "Preparation Campaign Ineffective"
central_asia_preparation_level_3_desc: "Great strides have been taken to reform our military, cutting away the dead wood within our ranks and the rotten core of corruption among our officers. However, initial optimism has given way to the realisation that as inspired as our reforms may be, they have fallen quite a bit short in their implementation. While some avenues of change have snuck past the wary eye of the traditionalists and we have been able to iron out some of the most egregious examples of inadequacy, corruption and mediocracy still reigns supreme in our military."
central_asia_preparation_level_4: "Preparation Campaign Rushed"
central_asia_preparation_level_4_desc: "It is better to take the time to do something correctly on the first attempt than to rush ahead and fail in the endeavour. Usually this maxim is applied to carpentry or architecture, wherein the worst results of mismanagement results in lopsided hovels or ill-aligned furniture. In the case of our army reform efforts, however, the results are slightly more weighty, with the defence of our nation now jeopardised by our inability to follow through. Significant deficits have been left to fester in the core of our army, and the corruption which has plagued our officers has been bruised but not truly dealt with."
central_asia_preparation_level_5: "Preparation Campaign Truncated"
central_asia_preparation_level_5_desc: "While there were high hopes for the success of our military preparation campaign from both our leaders and commanders, the sudden outbreak of war in the region has dashed any hope for truly comprehensive reform. If the peace had held even for another few years, we may have been able to crack down on the remaining excesses and deficits and been able to finalise our reforms, but as it stands our efforts have been herculean and the results satisfactory. Some elements of our armed forces have been truly reformed, though problems remain within the majority of our units, and the culture of corruption has been tempered, though not fully stamped out."
central_asia_preparation_level_6: "Preparation Campaign Fruitful"
central_asia_preparation_level_6_desc: "No matter how successful an endeavour may be, there will always be room for an even greater victory. We have done what many considered impossible by moulding the listless bandits of our realm into the semblance of an army. While there are still some lingering elements of corruption and incompetence among our officers, logisticians, and army bureaucrats, many of the worst offenders have been purged, and the rest cowed by their fall. As for the soldiers in our ranks, their bellies and ammo boxes are full, they know which end of the rifle to point at the enemy, and they stand prepared to take on any and all of our enemies."
central_asia_preparation_level_7: "Preparation Campaign Triumphant"
central_asia_preparation_level_7_desc: "The frenetic campaign to prepare ourselves for war has made exceptional progress in the last year, and our army has come a long way from its sad state mere months ago. Thanks to an aggressive move towards modernisation and professionalisation and significant investment into all elements of our armed forces, we have turned over a new leaf. There are still elements of corruption and mismanagement within our forces, no doubt! Only a fool would believe that the great ship of state can turn in a year's time. Regardless, the days of pervasive bribery, crime, and nepotism are long past, and there is a bright future in store for our armies, should they survive the next months."

ALO_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Alash Orda was established as a result of the Russian Constituent Assembly, when the local Muslim population voted for autonomy as part of Russia. Since then, the autonomy existed under the rule of the Alash party, bringing social modernisation to its people. However, the Russian dependence grows more and more concerns, whether the noble Qazaq people should continue to agree with Russian colonial policy."
UZB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Emirate of Bukhara remained one of the islands of stability in the Central Asian region, but deep in its own problems and difficulties. Under medieval-style rule of Emir, Bukhara is in dire need of modernisation of its bureaucracy, army and regime."
TRK_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Republic of Turkestan, built by the Whites in the aftermath of Civil War is divided into various opposition factions, with country parts controlled by warlords, who believe they are undeservingly forgotten victors of the civil war. Whether the republic will survive or turn to radical ideologies is unclear."
KHI_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The existence of Khanate of Khiva has been more or less guaranteed by its stronger neighbour of Bukhara. Since 1918 the Khanate was ruled by a military dictator, Vizier Junaid-Khan. But his health becoming worse and worse with country risking a chance of ceasing to exist without its charismatic leader."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HONDURAN_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The suicide of President Andino in 1933, following the taking of the capital by peasant rebels, created a shockwave throughout Honduras. In the aftermath of the revolution a coalition of ambitious intelligensia and military personnel took over and instituted a "great purge" of dissenters and pro-US elements. Even they could not resist the lure of the United Fruit Company however, and its stranglehold on the Honduran economy. Now in serious decay the "Peasant's Republic" holds on by using military force to control the fragile transport links around the country and has all but lost control."
POLITICS_SAM_ZEMURRAY_DESC:0 "Samuel Zemurray has lived a life more deeply intertwined with Central America than most other Americans in history. Being born named Schmuel Zmurri in Bessarabia during the reign of the former Russian Empire in 1877 and immigrating to the American South at a young age with his Jewish family, Zemurray would get used to travel at a young age. He entered the world of business before the age of twenty, first tasting a Banana at age 16 in Mobile, Alabama, setting him on his path to becoming ‘Sam the Banana Man.’ Responsible for coups and political subversion in Honduras and Guatemala after beginning his meteoric career in the United Fruit Company, Zemurray’s business acumen is nearly unmatched in the world of the fruit trade. Following the chaos of the 2nd American Civil War, he tried his luck overseas and fled to Honduras to stake out a claim on the Isthmus of Opportunity. Now achieving his ultimate goal of dominating one of the Banana Republics of old with his ascension to rule in Honduras, Zemurray and the UFC will tirelessly slave away to tighten the conglomerate’s grip on Central America."

HON_peasant_republic_desc:0 "Honduras is a 'peasant republic'; that is to say it is run by the council in the name of the peasantry, and its official name is the Peasants and Workers Republic of Honduras. In practice, however, this government is moribund and has ceased to represent the people."
HON_december_revolution:0 "December Revolution"
HON_december_revolution_desc:0 "The December Revolution took place in 1932, when peasants occupied the capital and a loose coalition of different groups took power as the "Peasants' Council of Honduras". Now the revolution is regarded by some as a failure, but by others as having not gone far enough..."
HON_great_purge:0 "Great Purge"
HON_great_purge_desc:0 "The Great Purge was a mass persecution of members of the armed forces, primarily the Honduran army, who had links to America. While the commercial realities of the situation meant that American influence would creep back in and the Monroe Doctrine would remain in force, it still crippled the Honduran army, which is... something, one might suppose."

honduras.200.t:0 "State of the Army"
honduras.200.d:0 "The Honduran Army is a small one and currently suffers from an severe lack of competent leadership due to the purges of American-connected officers that have occurred.

hon_ufc.1.t:0 "A Familiar Face Returns to Honduras"
hon_ufc.1.d:0 "With the Second American Civil War raging in the ever-fractioning hellscape of the former United States, refugees from across the states have fled both north and south to flee the horrors of war. Sitting squarely across the Gulf of Mexico from the dying Union lies our proud people’s state, and with this direct route to America so close by sea route, Honduras has received more than its fair share of migrants. One of the more raucous and outspoken of these fleeing faces has been Samuel Zemurray, famous Jewish-American emigre from Russia and ravenous businessman. Fleeing the America First regime from his home in New Orleans after falling out with Huey Long, as well as the Union State’s anti-semitic friends in the Silver Legion, Zemurray arrived by boat to our shores with the most recent wave of fleeing Yankees. Given his past links to the Honduran coup that enshrined UFC domination over our nation for decades, Zemurray has chosen Honduras as his choice of exile, possibly seeking to repeat past successes in our lands. With his arrival, our administration expects him to quickly join the upper rung of Honduran society, given his immense wealth and business acumen, prior history, and his reputation as a firebrand and a schemer, previously playing a role in the previous administration that fell with the revolution. We will allow him into our borders for now, but we shall keep an eye on him to ensure the security of the Revolution!"
hon_ufc.1.a:0 "We must remain vigilant with this snake’s arrival."

hon_ufc.2.t:0 "Cutting off the Head of the Snake"
hon_ufc.2.d:0 "We have had enough of Samuel Zemurray’s proselytization of capitalism on our shores and in our cities. We must behead this snake if the Revolution is to maintain itself in our proud state. Even now, the vile serpent snakes his way into the crevices of our administration, with his great wealth and charisma carrying him far in our admittedly corrupt bureaucracy. To end this infestation before it gets out of hand, Chairman [tag.leadernamer] and his lackeys have called for the arrest of this rapscallion in order to sever the head of this capitalist beast once and for all. However, the more moderate and liberal wings of our revolutionary congress seek to respect his rights as a refugee and merely maintain our strict surveillance of Zemurray instead. The final choice will be up to a chamber vote as tensions flare in the congress over this important debate."

hon_ufc.2.b:0 "Arrest this capitalist troublemaker at once."

hon_ufc.3.t:0 "The Government Moves against Zemurray"
hon_ufc.3.d:0 "Samuel Zemurray stood in his study, glaring outside the window of his modest home in Managua he had been lying low at for weeks. Hearing of the possible play being made by the deceitful ‘revolutionary’ government and their goons, the aging businessman stared out at the city before him, sensing something was amiss in the still night air. Hearing sirens faintly start in the distance, his mind set alight with plans and schemes as Zemurray plotted to come up with a plan of action while also furiously packing his important belongings. He could take the ‘safe’ approach, quickly renting a boat from a local dockhand and setting sail back to friendly waters and the States. Though the fires of the civil war were still raging, perhaps he could resettle in the Union State, or if [TEX.getleader]’s regime proved too unstable or hostile to him, he could seek refuge in the Federal holdouts or even the Pacific States. In stark contrast to this, the alternative would be far more proactive in its approach: Zemurray could hire local mercenaries and gunmen to serve as his retinue or posse, guarding him from the false revolutionary ‘Reds’ with his mountain of green capital left over from his business ventures. Though risky, this avenue could prove to hold more potential for the old captain of industry, as the potential for economic intervention into Central America would be immense, and without the strings of bureaucracy that the possible boon from helping rebuild a post-war America would assuredly have. Zemurray must think on his feet, as the sirens he heard are beginning to grow closer..."

hon_ufc.4.d:0 "Police arrived on the small bungalow in force, charging up the stairs, guns drawn, and bursting through the front door as sirens and flashing lights lit up the twilight gloom. As the police flooded into the room, they were not met with the hail of gunfire from a desperate man they so expected, but instead silence and darkness in the clearly abandoned home. As the police tore apart the home searching for clues, Zemurray was speeding down the road on his way to his predetermined safe-house, awaiting the inevitable onslaught of lawmen that would soon rain down upon him. Calling his associates on the way with details, a few dozen local ruffians and professionals had been hired to guard Zemurray and would meet him at the hideout. As he sped down the main road, new sirens could be heard gathering in the distant, louder and more numerous than the small pack he narrowly avoided at his bungalow. He would arrive at his destination just before they would, and he and his men had better be ready for a fight when they do.\n\nAs twilight turned to night, Zemurray and his posse silently squatted behind window sills and furniture as the blinding glare of headlights shined in through the front windows, bathing Zemurray’s safehouse in light. As the sound of the first cop car opening sounded, a series of metallic clicks went off around the room, as the criminals began to cock their pistols and carbines, readying for the fight ahead. As the sound of footsteps from the leading officer rounded the outside corner of the home and stopped outside the front door, a sense of palpable anxiety and tension filled the dark room. In a flash, the front door was kicked in with a hail of hot lead following it as all mayhem broke out and a full firefight began. The revolutionary police, not knowing of the hornet’s nest they just kicked open, fled to cover behind cinder block walls and squad cars as their leading officer who opened the door lay in ever growing pool of his own blood, clutching a gunshot wound to his neck while the maelstrom of lead and smoke continued. Calling out to their lead officer, who now lay still in his crimson puddle near the front door of the safehouse, the rest of the squad panicked with the realization that their commanding officer was down, leaving control up to the rookie deputy to make the call. Under immense pressure, he must decide to fall back in the face of this unexpected retaliation, or double down and bring Zemurray to justice to safeguard the Peasant’s Revolution of Honduras! With rounds flying in the air as glass and smoke scattering everywhere, the deputy must make his choice!"

While many Hondurans fear this American to be the herald of doom to their socialist paradise, others celebrate his arrival as some sort of champion to capitalism and the destruction of the government's alleged "corruption." The administration must fix the mistakes of its rookie officers and prevent a repeat of the eras of American domination. With fighting already breaking out as Zemurray hires more and more militants and guerillas, a clash of colors has been brought to the tiny nation of Honduras, between the green of the Capitalist’s cash and greed, and the red of the worker’s rightful Revolution! WIth the first real battle of this power struggle quickly approaching, which shall triumph in this wild land?"

Having won the first round of conflicts with the elitist-led ‘revolutionaries’, Zemurray could force the administration to accept his arrival and leave him to his own devices, allowing him to focus on his businesses and retirement. However, that is not his only option; with the recent string of victories under his belt, Sam Zemurray could potentially catapult himself to the forefront of Honduran politics and economics by doubling down on his recent actions, hiring more mercenaries and further pushing the corrupt "peasant's" government until some real changes can be made. With the future of Honduras potentially handing in the balance, the choice now lies solely on Zemurray’s shoulders."

Touting his recent victories Sam Zemurray has decided to try and coup the government of Honduras for the second time in his life, this time seeking to make it permanent. Rushing to meet them to muster a defense is the revolutionary guard and armed forces of Honduras, proud and zealous revolutionary warriors ready to lay their life down for the nation and cause. The fight ahead will be vicious, but there can only be one victor. With the shrill cry of artillery fire sounding in the distance, it seems the battle for the soul of Honduras will be quickly upon us."

Now that he controls the reigns of Honduras’ destiny, Zemurray must decide who shall serve as the official face of the nation. He could appoint a friendly junta under longtime associate and esteemed General José Castro, ruling the nation from the shadows while Castro serves as the frontman of our operation. Alternatively, he could avoid his past mistake of instating an intermediary and instead take direct control over Honduras himself, eliminating any misunderstandings in who would be truly calling the shots in the government. The final choice lies with him, but regardless Zemurray will hold most of the power under either system.."

Under his steely watch, Honduras will shed its pseudo-revolutionary, elitist shell and don the mantle of the United Fruit Company instead, becoming a beacon for capitalistic excess and American influence in Central America while tearing down the institutions of the relatively short-lived socialist regime that preceded his."

With his famed business acumen and sharp intellectual mind, Zemurray is expected to rule Honduras in a highly calculated manner as he opens the doors of Honduras’ resources and fertile land to the UFC.

With these moves, the cash has once again begun to flood in as Zemurray’s fortune exponentially expanded. With the wounds of Black Monday healing across the word, demand for the yellow fruits has begun to climb once more, and with their rise so too does Zemurray’s power and wealth with them."

With their new found sources of wealth, the UFC, and with it Zemurray’s Honduras, has catapulted to the forefront of Central America becoming the dominating player on the isthmus and with their newly won position, have begun to worm their way into the administrations and economies of our neighbors.

Starting with a slew of new housing complexes, suburbs, and apartments, the administration will solve the housing crisis that the pseudo-revolutionaries promised and failed at addressing. Once the foundations for new housing units have been laid, we will move on to the creation of new recreation centers and, most important;y, new public clinics to dot the nation with, expanding health coverage and public joy across Honduras.

Small boats and train cars have arrived full of Jewish immigrants these past few months, with the numbers increasing exponentially with each arrival, and many have begun to settle in the new developmental areas built by the UFC seeking free lands and new opportunity. Though relatively small in number, more Jew’s now live in Honduras than any other nation in Central America, and their rate of arrival doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.

Of all the noble statesmen in their administration, none has taken to our delegation more warmly than Jorge Ubico, the infamous Napoleon of Latin America. Agreeing with our stance towards the UFC and our nation's emphasis on order and militarism, Ubico has become fast friends with both Samuel Zemurray and José Castro, with the three working closely with each other on deals and future schemes.

By owning the arteries of the region, UFC dominance will be ensured with the other nations of the region being able to do little but bend to UFC demands in order to merely ship goods within their own borders. Though buying up every last rail line will take time, effort, and a whole lot of capital, the results would be monumental in the United Fruit Company’s plan at subjugating all of Central America under their boot."

While her mother the author Sarah, her father Sam the Banana Man, her brother the Louisiana National Guard veteran Sam Jr., and their business partners like Adolph Katz and Jacob Weinberger, have all spent their recent lives creating the greatest Capitalist corporate construct in the New World, Doris instead has spent her young life exploring the world and living a life of scientific adventure. Born in 1909 in New Orleans before the Zemurray family continued their journey southward, Doris studied at Tulane University which still sits across the street from the Zemurray family home at the Beaux Arts mansion on St. Charles Ave in New Orleans, before her education later took her to Cambridge, Harvard, Union College, and the Middle American Research Institute, graduating from being a simple undergrad student to a research associate and eventually as an honorary professor. \n\nAn archeologist, ethnographer, and anthropologist specializing in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures within the so-called ‘Intermediate Area’ of lower Central America around Costa Rica, Doris and her new husband Roger Thayer Stone - a fellow anthropologist - have traveled the New World while spreading the joys of education and scientific knowledge as they work to uncover the historical mysteries of Mesoamerica’s native past. Though Doris may not be involved directly in the running of our corporate state or the UFC, she is still an immense source of support for her father, with Sam the Banana Man even using a portion of his own immense wealth to open up research centers, schools, libraries, native relief centers, and other humanitarian sources of education and knowledge for the masses under his control to appease his daughter. With people like Doris at his side, Sam is sure to keep the masses in his heart even as he builds this massive corporate structure above their heads."

After fleeing from Tsarist forces in what is now Ukraine before the turn of the century, Sam found himself in the poor minority neighbors of New York City before he began his journey both southwards and towards capital on the back of his many business ventures. By 1917, Zemurray had made his first few fortunes and used his amassed wealth to buy the Beaux Arts mansion on St. Charles Ave in New Orleans, right across the street from Tulane University where his children like Doris would eventually study. It is this home that the Zemurrays have lived in for decades, and it is this home at the heart of New Orleans we now wish to save.

Council members Callejas and Castro have nearly come to blows over their differing views, and wild accusations are being made by either side, while Councilors Morales and Galvez have formed a united front arguing for the dissolution of the Council and its reformation as an elected body; ultimately there seems to be only a few options..."

honduras.14.t:0 "General Castro Takes Control"
honduras.14.d:0 "Today, General Jose Castro was sworn in as the President of Honduras and elevated to head of the armed forces.

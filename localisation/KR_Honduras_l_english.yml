### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HONDURAN_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The Second Honduran Civil War had left the country ruined and isolated in the world, as the desperation inherent in both sides to secure victory had made the conflict particularly disastrous. As foreign interference in the war began to become crippling, both sides were ultimately able to find an accord in the formation of the Council of National Salvation, hoping to reconstruct the nation, compromise the political differences of all involved, and ensure that the country would not become another puppet to the whims of foreigners. While reconstruction was accomplished with the help of the Honduran Army, the potential in fully exiling foreign influence was not, as the UFC continued in its strangehold upon the nation. The council's deeply visible corruption, alongside its heavy-handed response to the December Revolution, had prompted a concession in the form of the upcoming elections to be held in May of 1936. Within the time since then, the council has overseen the creation of an electoral infrastructure, but it has also had to tolerate the formation and return of various political parties whose platforms it finds unsettling. While this has made the council flounder in truly committing to the process, it's understood by many that disaster would befall Honduras if the promised elections were to be cancelled."
POLITICS_SAM_ZEMURRAY_DESC:0 "Samuel Zemurray has lived a life more deeply intertwined with Central America than most other Americans in history. Being born named Schmuel Zmurri in Bessarabia during the reign of the former Russian Empire in 1877 and immigrating to the American South at a young age with his Jewish family, Zemurray would get used to travel at a young age. He entered the world of business before the age of twenty, first tasting a Banana at age 16 in Mobile, Alabama, setting him on his path to becoming ‘Sam the Banana Man.’ Responsible for coups and political subversion in Honduras and Guatemala after beginning his meteoric career in the United Fruit Company, Zemurray’s business acumen is nearly unmatched in the world of the fruit trade. Following the chaos of the 2nd American Civil War, he tried his luck overseas and fled to Honduras to stake out a claim on the Isthmus of Opportunity. Now achieving his ultimate goal of dominating one of the Banana Republics of old with his ascension to rule in Honduras, Zemurray and the UFC will tirelessly slave away to tighten the conglomerate’s grip on Central America."
#Ideas
HON_paralyzing_corruption:0 "Corruption of the Council"
HON_paralyzing_corruption_desc:0 "Honduras' Council of National Salvation has become a den of greed and avarice, with many of the leading members serving their own pockets rather than the interests of the Honduran citizens. While this has led to some industrial developments per the investment of foreign companies, most notably the UFC, it has created a deep sense of hatred in the average Honduran citizen for their government."
HON_growing_instability:0 "Slipping Towards Chaos"
HON_growing_instability_desc:0 "As the council's blatant corruption became more obvious to the people of Honduras, they grew antagonized enough to revolt against both the government and their foreign benefactors in December of 1935. Angered at both the functional sale of Honduras to the UFC and the growing economic troubles of the Great Depression, the people had demanded an end to the council's lengthy rule and the expulsion of the UFC's offices. The council had acquiesced in the form of promised elections in May of 1936, but no one's forgotten just how brutal the repression of the riots was, or the fact that the UFC maintains a tight grip on Honduras' economy. In the eyes of many, the Honduran state is teetering on the brink of collapse."
HON_unruly_army:0 "Unruly Army"
HON_unruly_army_desc:0 "The Honduran Army had been instrumental in reconstructing the country in the aftermath of the Second Civil War, but now the differences between the army's desires and the council's have resulted in dissident ambitions forming in many of the officers and soldiers of the armed forces. The army has made it clear that it won't sit by and let the country fall into disaster once again, and while the council has taken steps to try and weaken the military it hasn't made their threats any less genuine."
HON_UFC_corrosive:0 "Corrosive Influence of the UFC"
HON_UFC_corrosive_desc:0 "The UFC maintains a crippling level of influence over the economy of Honduras, and thus the society itself. A majority of the land within Honduras is company-held, and the UFC's brutal labor practices remain a black mark upon the country. The state's inability and unwillingness to resolve the issue has only made the problem that much worse."

honduras.200.d:0 "The Honduran Army is a small one and currently suffers from an severe lack of competent leadership due to the purges of American-connected officers that have occurred.

hon_ufc.1.d:0 "With the Second American Civil War raging in the ever-fractioning hellscape of the former United States, refugees from across the states have fled both north and south to flee the horrors of war. Sitting squarely across the Gulf of Mexico from the dying Union lies our proud people’s state, and with this direct route to America so close by sea route, Honduras has received more than its fair share of migrants. One of the more raucous and outspoken of these fleeing faces has been Samuel Zemurray, famous Jewish-American emigre from Russia and ravenous businessman. Fleeing the America First regime from his home in New Orleans after falling out with Huey Long, as well as the Union State’s anti-semitic friends in the Silver Legion, Zemurray arrived by boat to our shores with the most recent wave of fleeing Yankees. Given his past links to the Honduran coup that enshrined UFC domination over our nation for decades, Zemurray has chosen Honduras as his choice of exile, possibly seeking to repeat past successes in our lands. With his arrival, our administration expects him to quickly join the upper rung of Honduran society, given his immense wealth and business acumen, prior history, and his reputation as a firebrand and a schemer, previously playing a role in the previous administration that fell with the revolution. We will allow him into our borders for now, but we shall keep an eye on him to ensure the security of the Revolution!"

We must behead this snake if the Revolution is to maintain itself in our proud state. Even now, the vile serpent snakes his way into the crevices of our administration, with his great wealth and charisma carrying him far in our admittedly corrupt bureaucracy. To end this infestation before it gets out of hand, Chairman [tag.leadernamer] and his lackeys have called for the arrest of this rapscallion in order to sever the head of this capitalist beast once and for all. However, the more moderate and liberal wings of our revolutionary congress seek to respect his rights as a refugee and merely maintain our strict surveillance of Zemurray instead. The final choice will be up to a chamber vote as tensions flare in the congress over this important debate."

Hearing of the possible play being made by the deceitful ‘revolutionary’ government and their goons, the aging businessman stared out at the city before him, sensing something was amiss in the still night air. Hearing sirens faintly start in the distance, his mind set alight with plans and schemes as Zemurray plotted to come up with a plan of action while also furiously packing his important belongings. He could take the ‘safe’ approach, quickly renting a boat from a local dockhand and setting sail back to friendly waters and the States. Though the fires of the civil war were still raging, perhaps he could resettle in the Union State, or if [TEX.getleader]’s regime proved too unstable or hostile to him, he could seek refuge in the Federal holdouts or even the Pacific States. In stark contrast to this, the alternative would be far more proactive in its approach: Zemurray could hire local mercenaries and gunmen to serve as his retinue or posse, guarding him from the false revolutionary ‘Reds’ with his mountain of green capital left over from his business ventures. Though risky, this avenue could prove to hold more potential for the old captain of industry, as the potential for economic intervention into Central America would be immense, and without the strings of bureaucracy that the possible boon from helping rebuild a post-war America would assuredly have. Zemurray must think on his feet, as the sirens he heard are beginning to grow closer..."

As the police flooded into the room, they were not met with the hail of gunfire from a desperate man they so expected, but instead silence and darkness in the clearly abandoned home. As the police tore apart the home searching for clues, Zemurray was speeding down the road on his way to his predetermined safe-house, awaiting the inevitable onslaught of lawmen that would soon rain down upon him. Calling his associates on the way with details, a few dozen local ruffians and professionals had been hired to guard Zemurray and would meet him at the hideout. As he sped down the main road, new sirens could be heard gathering in the distant, louder and more numerous than the small pack he narrowly avoided at his bungalow. He would arrive at his destination just before they would, and he and his men had better be ready for a fight when they do.\n\nAs twilight turned to night, Zemurray and his posse silently squatted behind window sills and furniture as the blinding glare of headlights shined in through the front windows, bathing Zemurray’s safehouse in light. As the sound of the first cop car opening sounded, a series of metallic clicks went off around the room, as the criminals began to cock their pistols and carbines, readying for the fight ahead. As the sound of footsteps from the leading officer rounded the outside corner of the home and stopped outside the front door, a sense of palpable anxiety and tension filled the dark room. In a flash, the front door was kicked in with a hail of hot lead following it as all mayhem broke out and a full firefight began. The revolutionary police, not knowing of the hornet’s nest they just kicked open, fled to cover behind cinder block walls and squad cars as their leading officer who opened the door lay in ever growing pool of his own blood, clutching a gunshot wound to his neck while the maelstrom of lead and smoke continued. Calling out to their lead officer, who now lay still in his crimson puddle near the front door of the safehouse, the rest of the squad panicked with the realization that their commanding officer was down, leaving control up to the rookie deputy to make the call. Under immense pressure, he must decide to fall back in the face of this unexpected retaliation, or double down and bring Zemurray to justice to safeguard the Peasant’s Revolution of Honduras!

The administration must fix the mistakes of its rookie officers and prevent a repeat of the eras of American domination. With fighting already breaking out as Zemurray hires more and more militants and guerillas, a clash of colors has been brought to the tiny nation of Honduras, between the green of the Capitalist’s cash and greed, and the red of the worker’s rightful Revolution!

However, that is not his only option; with the recent string of victories under his belt, Sam Zemurray could potentially catapult himself to the forefront of Honduran politics and economics by doubling down on his recent actions, hiring more mercenaries and further pushing the corrupt "peasant's" government until some real changes can be made. With the future of Honduras potentially handing in the balance, the choice now lies solely on Zemurray’s shoulders."

He could appoint a friendly junta under longtime associate and esteemed General José Castro, ruling the nation from the shadows while Castro serves as the frontman of our operation. Alternatively, he could avoid his past mistake of instating an intermediary and instead take direct control over Honduras himself, eliminating any misunderstandings in who would be truly calling the shots in the government.

With these moves, the cash has once again begun to flood in as Zemurray’s fortune exponentially expanded.

Once the foundations for new housing units have been laid, we will move on to the creation of new recreation centers and, most important;y, new public clinics to dot the nation with, expanding health coverage and public joy across Honduras.

Small boats and train cars have arrived full of Jewish immigrants these past few months, with the numbers increasing exponentially with each arrival, and many have begun to settle in the new developmental areas built by the UFC seeking free lands and new opportunity. Though relatively small in number, more Jew’s now live in Honduras than any other nation in Central America, and their rate of arrival doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.

Of all the noble statesmen in their administration, none has taken to our delegation more warmly than Jorge Ubico, the infamous Napoleon of Latin America. Agreeing with our stance towards the UFC and our nation's emphasis on order and militarism, Ubico has become fast friends with both Samuel Zemurray and José Castro, with the three working closely with each other on deals and future schemes.

To commemorate this occasion and support the cause, Zemurray has begun to purchase land in Jewish Madagascar to facilitate settlement and to support the newly formed state.

In short order they began to come rapidly, eager to carve out an existence for themselves free of oppression. Since that move, the Jewish population has grown to become nearly 35% of our total populace, with some urban areas having a Jewish majority. With this in mind, several proposals for the creation of a Jewish Homeland in Honduras have reached the desk of Zemurray. While this would no doubt put us in the good graces of our Jewish population, the native Hondurans would almost without question hate our government even more possibly leading to future conflict. Regardless, the future of the Chosen People in Honduras rests solely on Zemurray's shoulders."

hon_ufc.22.d:0 "Although the UFC - formerly just the Cuyamel Fruit Company or even just the Hubbard-Zemurray Steam Ship Company before all that in the time before Sam outbid his partner Ashbell Hubbard to begin his personal climb up the corporate ladder - has long been the dominant interest of our patriarch and his wife, the Zemurray family is not exclusively locked into the world of consumer capital thanks to the colorful life of Doris Zemurray - Sam’s eldest daughter. While her mother the author Sarah, her father Sam the Banana Man, her brother the Louisiana National Guard veteran Sam Jr., and their business partners like Adolph Katz and Jacob Weinberger, have all spent their recent lives creating the greatest Capitalist corporate construct in the New World, Doris instead has spent her young life exploring the world and living a life of scientific adventure. Born in 1909 in New Orleans before the Zemurray family continued their journey southward, Doris studied at Tulane University which still sits across the street from the Zemurray family home at the Beaux Arts mansion on St. Charles Ave in New Orleans, before her education later took her to Cambridge, Harvard, Union College, and the Middle American Research Institute, graduating from being a simple undergrad student to a research associate and eventually as an honorary professor.\n\nAn archeologist, ethnographer, and anthropologist specializing in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures within the so-called ‘Intermediate Area’ of lower Central America around Costa Rica, Doris and her new husband Roger Thayer Stone - a fellow anthropologist - have traveled the New World while spreading the joys of education and scientific knowledge as they work to uncover the historical mysteries of Mesoamerica’s native past. Though Doris may not be involved directly in the running of our corporate state or the UFC, she is still an immense source of support for her father, with Sam the Banana Man even using a portion of his own immense wealth to open up research centers, schools, libraries, native relief centers, and other humanitarian sources of education and knowledge for the masses under his control to appease his daughter. With people like Doris at his side, Sam is sure to keep the masses in his heart even as he builds this massive corporate structure above their heads."

hon_ufc.23.t:0 "Final Fate of the Zemurray’s Family Home"
hon_ufc.23.d:0 "Although our family and our corporate interests have come to rest in Honduras and wider Central America, we Zemurrays have never forgotten our true home - New Orleans. After fleeing from Tsarist forces in what is now Ukraine before the turn of the century, Sam found himself in the poor minority neighbors of New York City before he began his journey both southwards and towards capital on the back of his many business ventures. By 1917, Zemurray had made his first few fortunes and used his amassed wealth to buy the Beaux Arts mansion on St. Charles Ave in New Orleans, right across the street from Tulane University where his children like Doris would eventually study. It is this home that the Zemurrays have lived in for decades, and it is this home at the heart of New Orleans we now wish to save. The rising conflict and unrest in the United States has put our old home in danger of falling to radicalism or something worse. Should we risk war with our fellow Americans just to reclaim our old home, or should we just face the facts and accept we are Central Americans now?"
hon_ufc.23.a:0 "Abandon the mansion. Central America is our only home now."

honduras.1.t:0 "Beginnings of the Banana Republic"
honduras.1.d:0 "Independent from the Spanish since 1821, and from the Federal Republic of Central America since 1838, Honduras has held a history of civil strife and foreign intervention that has left it unable to seize a destiny of fortune in the tropical paradise that over a million call home. Its status as a rural nation left it as an easy target for the various fruit companies of the United States who were eager to secure cheap labor, and the poverty of Honduras itself made its rulers more than willing to open the country up to foreign money.\n\nIt would be in 1889 that the first shipment of bananas would leave Honduras and enter New Orleans, and from there Honduras' entire economy was slowly reoriented to banana production. Fierce economic competition between various companies led to vertical integration being the norm, and thus these companies often owned Honduran land directly rather than purchasing it from native farmers. This situation only became further exacerbated as these companies offered to build rail infrastructure on land they would own themselves, which the impoverished Honduras was unable to refuse.\n\nOver time the power of the fruit companies, especially the United Fruit Company, would grow so much as to lead to company control of docks, roads, entire tracts of land, and functionally control the economy of Honduras itself. Being so shackled to the profits of bananas had meant that wars such as the Weltkrieg were disastrous for the nation, which now found itself absent buyers of its usual products.\n\nEven with this pervasive control, upheld by frequent US intervention in the region, the companies had never relinquished an inch of their influence, leading Honduras to become growingly unstable..."
honduras.1.a:0 "But what happened next?"

honduras.7.t:0 "The Time of Troubles"
honduras.7.d:0 "When the sitting president of Honduras had refused to allow for open elections, General Rafael López Gutiérrez opened an armed conflict against him and his loyalists with the support of both the majority of the population and the United States itself. The First Honduran Civil War was quick, lasting merely a month, but its victor would proceed to try and legitimize his rule through a deeply manipulated election that secured him the presidency for himself.\n\nHonduras would then suffer an assortment of attempted coups and various uprisings, all of which sent the nation closer towards the brink of destruction, and so the 1923 elections were frought with troubles that resulted in no winner who could secure a majority, yet charismatic general Tiburcio Carías Andino seemed the frontrunner. López Gutiérrez, however, declared he would remain in office until new elections could be held at an indetermine time. This proved to be the final straw for the country, as the Second Honduran Civil War would begin with Andino leading the charge against what was seen as a blatant autocrat.\n\nThe war would stretch into 1926 with no side securing a major victory against the other, and as foreign interests in the form of various companies and volunteers, most alarmingly from the openly socialist Mexico, began to more directly reveal themselves, both sides managed to find an accord in trying to uproot Honduras' victimhood at the hands of foreigners once and for all. The Council of National Salvation, a council formed from neutral parties during the conflict, was created after a truce was officialized between the warring groups in order to rebuild the country and ensure that the war-torn nation would not find itself further cannibalized by its neighbors or American businesses.\n\nWhile the council had done its duty to restore Honduras to pre-war development, as small as it was, it has grown fat in continued control of the country. A grand strike in December of 1935 revealed the Honduran people had had enough of the council's governance of the nation, and it has promised elections to be held in May 1936 to finally grant the Honduran people a say in how their nation can try and finally obtain true independence. Of course, the council is easily seen as abhorring the promise it gave, so any calamity that may befall Honduras in the coming weeks could cancel this well-deserved chance at freedom..."

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_ROSEN_DESC:0 "The last of a dying breed, Carl Gustaf von Rosen is the epitome of the honorable mercenary ideal. Born in 1909 in Helgesta to the famous Swedish explorer Eric von Rosen, adventure and the pursuit of glory has always been in Carl’s blood despite being labeled the black sheep of his family. Taking an interest in mechanics and aeronautics at a young age, the young von Rosen became obsessed with flight and speed. Studying at Lundsbergs and AB Aeromateriel, Carl would train to become a test pilot and a barnstormer, doing death-defying stunts of acrobatics within his flying machines, cementing his love of the air. During the early 30s, the young von Rosen learned of the atrocities committed at the hands of numerous colonial regimes across Africa, and so took it upon himself to fly relief missions for those poor souls whose lives were racked by war and conflict they themselves did not start. Flying for rebels in Kenya, separatists in Nigeria, and for natives in the Congo, Carl showed his true colors as a man of the people and a true freedom-fighter, especially against those regimes who would use horrific weapons of a biological or chemical nature, like the governments of Westafrika and Südwestafrika. With this infamous career, von Rosen made a name for himself across Africa as a guardian to the downtrodden and as the archetypal mercenary lord. With the power struggle to control the Mercenaries du Congo Ouest now over, von Rosen now amasses his band of flyboys and hired-guns, seeking to transform the Congo into a free, noble, and secure state under the watch of his airwings and legions. Only under their new Consul shall this ancient Eden be made civilized and equal."
POLITICS_MASSU_DESC:0 "The young officer-turned-mercenary Jacques Massu has lived through a violent career in his short life. Born in 1908 in France before the fall of the Empire, Massu was just a child when Paris fell and the Commune rose, and witnessed the fall of an empire with his very own eyes as brother fought brother in the Fall of France before finally escaping to Algiers with his family. Burning with a patriotic zeal common for men in the nationalist exile regime in Algiers, Massu fell into a military life as soon as he came of age, and spent much of his early military career crushing Tuaregs and other tribes of the Sahara for the Petain regime. Growing disillusioned with his government’s ‘righteous destiny’ to reclaim the Metropole, Massu and a retinue of his closest comrades and followers fled from French Chad into Sub-Saharan Africa, finding themselves in the Vrijstaat and finding quick positions within the Force Publique as foreign hires. As Massu and his men continued their work under the FP, they increasingly began to fall further into ‘corrupt’ practices, such as taking bribes or looting tribal settlements, quickly picking up a taste for the mercenary lifestyle while furthering their own deluded sense of morality under Massu’s new ‘knightly’ codes. After their commanding officers in the Force Publique had gotten wind of the nature of their new habits, Massu and his men were once again forced to flee. However, this time they would not flee to another colony or regime, but to the Jungle itself, seeking to carve out their own mercenary fiefdom based on Massu’s own twisted ideas of chivalry free from the prying eyes and nagging rules of other lesser regimes."
POLITICS_HALLSTROM_DESC:0 "Few men could manage to control the varied groups and cliques within the Mercenaries du Congo Ouest, let alone forge them into a unified front, and yet Gustaf Hallström has managed to do just that. Born in 1880 to Swedish school teachers, Gustaf spent much of his young life pursuing higher education, studying to become an antiquarian, an archaeologist, and a philosopher at Uppsala University - a stark contrast to the background of many others within this brotherhood. Under this career, Hallström became famous within academic circles for his work on documenting the petroglyphs of the Sami peoples, with each dig having him further languish away in stuffy academia until the call of adventure landed upon his ear. \n\nDriven on largely by his soldier-turned-adventurer for a brother, Thord Ivor Hallström, Gustaf would drop his life of digging in the snow and mud for a lifetime of action and pursuing the true unknown. Arriving in Mittelafrika from Sweden in the mid-1920’s, Gustaf, along with Ivor and his other brother Gunnar - the famed artist and intellectual, carved his way through the dark expanse of Africa, taking odd jobs as soldiers-of-fortune and explorers while slowly amassing their group of dedicated lackeys and followers. Seeing the Congo as the final true African frontier and the last place on Earth free from the prying eyes of the modern world, the Hallström brothers slowly made their way deeper into this primordial jungle, integrating with other mercenary groups until the Mercenaries du Congo Ouest was formed and grew strong enough to cast off the shackles of colonial rule. Now, with the colonials dead and the old order toppled, the Congo now stands as a new cornucopia of opportunity for Hallström and his men - a perfect heaven and hideaway here at the Dark Heart of Africa."

Though our mercenary brotherhood now rules this jungle and most of the old colonials are either dead or now paid off by our regime, the old colonial powers like Flanders-Wallonia and the Kaiserreich are entirely unaware of our true nature and intentions. With garbled and disguised radio transmissions, bribed officials giving false testimonies supporting our claims, and through keeping up with the economic quotas the Vrijstaat once had to fill, we have preserved our Outer Heaven and hidden it away from prying eyes and those who would seek to undo our great works here. We must walk a delicate line and make sure as to not slip up and reveal our true nature, for the Global Subversion Campaign is our main line of defense against the greedy powers who would seek to reconquer our new home."

Calling them ‘railguns’, these magnetized projectile-launchers may be temperamental and require insane amounts of power to function, but the devastation they can bring to bear is truly awe-inspiring. By developing these weapons along with other strange weapons found in these stolen plans, we shall unleash modern warfare upon an unsuspecting world.’"

### Events ### 

outerheaven.0.t:0 "The Rise of a Mercenary-led Congo"
outerheaven.0.d:0 "Our mercenary brotherhood now stands atop a pile of bones and burned carcasses as the sole victors of the Congo Crisis. Under the command of our diverse coalition of mercenaries and soldiers of fortune, we have secured our mandate to rule the Dark Heart of Africa. Once the most profitable and prosperous colony in Africa, the Congo is now our personal fiefdom, and now we must decide who shall lead us in the wake of this outstanding victory. Though the future is uncertain, we see a bright destiny before us!"
outerheaven.0.a:0 "It would seem gambits pay off."

outerheaven.1.t:0 "Creating the Mercenary Committee"
outerheaven.1.d:0 "Jacques Massu leads the brave mercenaries of the West Congo in rebellion against the tyrannical Pierre Ryckmans as the Congo, and Mittelafrika as a whole, dissolve into a maelstrom of disorder and lawlessness. Under his guidance, we have revolted against the oppressive regime in the capital, seeking to bring true freedom to these dark jungles. However, many in our ranks seek to incorporate all of the various mercenary companies scattered across the Congo, uniting under one banner to fight for our right to wage war and live as we see fit. Leading this opposition is none other than famous explorer and soldier-for-hire Gustaf Hallstrom. The grizzled veteran serves as a unifying figure amongst the disparate mercenary groups, and many in our inner-circle feel that his inclusion would spell the end of our administration’s rule as we fall subservient to Hallstrom’s rule. How shall we go forward?"

Under the stalwart soldier’s skill and guidance, we shall march from Coquilhatville and descend into the greater Congo, spreading our influence as we hack our enemies down at every turn. We will carve out our own independent state free from the lording fools in Dar-Es-Salaam and Leopoldville. As we march towards our uncertain destiny, the lessons of von Hallstrom echo in the minds of each of our soldiers. “A strong man doesn’t need to see the future...he makes his own.”"
outerheaven.2.a:0 "This is our only home. Our heaven and our hell. This is Outer Heaven."

outerheaven.3.t:0 "Of Mercs and Men"
outerheaven.3.d:0 "Hired armies, soldiers of fortune, and other forms of mercenaries have been used in Africa for centuries, but the Vrijstaat has turned the practice into a practical arm of the state. Before the fall of Mittelafrika, mercs would be frequently used to supplement the Force Publique, with each payment upon services rendered adding to their strength and hunger for more war and profit. \n\nThe Mercenaries de Congo Ouest are the largest coalition of these mercenary groups in Africa, and possibly the world - a misfit band of thugs, soldiers, adventurers, poachers, thieves, hunters, sailors, pilots, and so many more banded together under one common identity and profession. With the collapse of the German colonial empire in Africa, this band of thieves has seized on the chance to declare their own sovereign mercenary state, and now they must fight for their lives to earn their right to independence. \n\nThe love of thrills and the unknown are what has driven them all to join up together as one, united band of mercenaries, for even mercs know that there is always strength and opportunity in numbers. However, our brotherhood is not as united and jovial as it may seem, and even now the various internal factions vye power and influence as [MSF.getleader] tries to lead us through these hellish times. Now, with our backs to the wall and all of the Congo against us, we must fight tooth and nail to carve out our own sector of the world here in the Dark Heart of Africa."
outerheaven.3.a:0 "No masters or gods, only war and adventure!"

outerheaven.4.t:0 "A Struggle for the Heart of Africa"
outerheaven.4.d:0 "The varied mercenaries of the Congo have long fought in this hell; the bones of their brothers strewn about these jungles and mires, far from the lands of their birth. The beasts and savages who visited such a craven death upon our comrades have since been brought to the sword, and now the only thing that stands in the way of total peace within this primordial thicket is each other. With the foes who solidified our cooperation now buried beneath the mud, the sights of the largest and most ambitious camps and cliques within our brotherhood have now all leveleved their sights upon one another, and the tense atmosphere of coming war hands in the air. \n\nThe three main cliques that hold any chance of winning could not be more different in their approach, both to war and in how they administer their own forces. The favorite to win the struggle, with the largest amassed force and the widest range of weapons of war at his disposal, is Gustaf Hallström who along with his two brothers aim to create a true and pure mercenary state entirely devoted to the pursuit of war, adventure, and profit while remaining free from the entanglements of foreign diplomacy. Ready to use experimental weaponry, gas tactics, and other cutthroat methods, Hallström and his clique shall be a tough force to overcome. The main rival to this cut-throat force of true soldiers of fortune is the second largest faction within our brotherhood, belonging to Carl Gustaf von Rosen. A famous pilot and freedom fighter, von Rosen leads his diverse force of former Askari, wartime pilots, and less biased soldiers within our ranks as the new Mark Antony or Consul of the Congo, seeking to carve out an egalitarian and colorblind mercenary republic based on Roman idealism and meritocratic beliefs. The darkhorse of the competition, leading a smaller force than either that of Hallström’s or von Rosen’s, is Chevalier Jacques Massu, who has quickly become known as the Congolese Knight or the Dauphin of Congo Ouest. Massu, still holding connections to Entente contacts from his time in the Algiers Regime, is well funded and well supplied, and though he and his chivalric knights are greatly outnumbered, they still have a solid chance in the coming battle. \n\nAs these forces prepare for the coming final battle, all within the Congo have grown tense as this wartorn Eden once more marches to the sounds of war drums and battle cries. Meeting on the great plateau that overlooks the Lufira river in Katanga, each of these three warlords have rallied their forces and now march against each other, rifles in hand and weapons at the ready. As the sound of dive bombing aircraft and thunderous artillery begin to shake the earth and shatter the skies, it has become clear to all that war has once again reached the Congo, and this time, hopefully, it shall be the final fight for some time."

Though this ‘total-control’ is entirely nominal, as most of the Congo still exists as an unpatrolled and uncontrolled, disconnected quagmire, none can deny von Rosen is now the most powerful man in the nation, and his forces are now the undisputed masters of this wild expanse.

outerheaven.6.d:0 "With the savages that comprised the ranks of von Rosen and Hallström’s cliques now thoroughly dealt with, all either defeated or absorbed in our growing order, the Knight of the Congo Jacques Massu now stands as the herald of this Eden’s new destiny. With this brave and studied soldier at the helm, Massu and his new retinue of mercenary lords and modern knights shall strive to purify the Congo of sin and dishonor, for the new foundations of Massu’s fiefdom shall be built upon his deep, albeit warped, understandings of chivalry, honor, and duty. For his brothers in arms and potentially for his formed homeland, Chevalier Massu, the newly christened Dauphin of the Congo, will ride forth into a glorious future as the champion and architect of our newly purified and reformed brotherhood."
outerheaven.6.a:0 "The Congo bows to its new Dauphin."

outerheaven.7.t:0 "A Soldiers Republic or a Council of Mercs?"
outerheaven.7.d:0 "As Carl Gustaf von Rosen has solidified his power base and anchored his position as the undisputed top man in the Congo, a nagging question has throbbed in the back of his mind - a question on national determination \n\n Von Rosen has long been sympathetic to the plight of people fighting for their natural right to govern themselves, to dictate how their own lives should be lived. With his mercs now allowing Congolese and European soldiers to fight and serve as total equals within our brotherhood and with our armed forces encompassing all aspects of our state, perhaps the time has come for von Rosen to finally break the final barrier and enact the scheme he has long pondered on. \n\n If enacted, von Rosen would open up local ‘democratic’ elections to all official citizens of our nation while allowing any previously-vetted citizen to run for office, with von Rosen of course staying as the Consul of the nation above all. However, since the only requirement to being a citizen is not race nor gender, but the ability to serve one’s own nation and its military in any way, it would in effect enfranchise all adults within the Congo that are enrolled in our army. Any man or woman who can carry a rifle or otherwise serve their nation and its military shall be given the full right to participate in this soldiers' republic. \n\nA revolutionary idea emulating the ideas of Rome and not seen in wide-scale use for centuries, this style of governance would be one of the single largest democratic transitions in modern history, affecting the lives of millions, though it would still be a far cry from modern Western-style democracies like France before the revolution or the United States before their recent turmoils. Just as easily, it could lead to the decay and eventual collapse of our nation as we fall under the tide of ineffectual governance at the hands of lead-for-brains mercs and conscripted Africans serving their own interests. \n\nThis uncertainty has been cause for enough concern, and an alternative idea has grown popular to oppose von Rosen’s naive dream. This alternate camp seeks to instead go for a more traditional and less radical governmental system where von Rosen would serve as the head of state with a council of his most trusted officers and native allies under him serving as advisor and administrators. Though less revolutionary and egalitarian, this system would almost certainly be more stable, though would also likely cause more instability with the locals. In the end, only von Rosen can make the decision, and with it he shall sign away the fate of tens of the millions across the heart of Africa."

outerheaven.8.d:0 "With Consul Carl Gustaf von Rosen’s decision to go forward with his dream of a soldiers republic here in the Congo, the foundations of this new republican government must be established. \n\nIn effect, the votes of our citizen-soldier shall only really matter at the local level, for anything resembling a national-level government is directly under the control of von Rosen and his closest advisors, aptly titled his Praetors. Below these loyal servants to our Consul, the various lower level elected officials, from our promagistrates to our local governors, shall handle the more monotonous, tedious local governance. Their ranks shall all be citizens of our nation, ranging from allied tribal chiefs and lords to influential colonials remaining in our borders. However, while to the wider public this new governmental system may seem like a united, or at-least semi-united front, in reality the ranks under von Rosen are a political warzone of vying cliques and interests all battling for control, figuratively and also sometimes literally going to war with each other for influence within this Soldiers Republic. With these forces jockeying for influence, von Rosen must choose a clique once more to set a definitive path and creed for this new republic. \n\nThe three main cliques are composed of a wide variety of forces. The most influential clique is mostly made up of various mercenaries, higher ranking government officials including most of our Praetorians to many of our loyal governors, our aerial legionnaire commanders, and myriads of regular citizen-soldiers who all follow von Rosen without question and adhere strictly to our old mercenary spirit, forming the Old Guard of our nation’s political and military sectors, as if they were separate. These veterans of our initial struggle against Massu and the Hallström Brothers simply want to adhere to our traditions - that we are mercenaries and soldiers first, politicians and nation-builders second. \n\nOpposing them are two much larger but less influential groups. The first of these groups are the less conservative, or more profit-orientated comrades of the Old Guard, as well as many of the renaming colonial assets within our government, particularly the UMHK. This coalition of colonials and money-hungry mercenaries are like a band of thieves and tycoons keen on reaping the Congo of its economic treasures. Following them are also many of the more adventure-oriented types within our ranks, who seek to scour the Congo for its abundance of artefacts and mysteries, with prominent archeologists and adventures such as Sir Leonard Wooley, Hiram Bingham, Henri Breuil, and Roy Chapman Adams all being affiliated with their ranks, and many others.  Finally, the largest but weakest of the cliques, only due to rabid suppression from the other two groups, is the ‘Humanitarian Clique’ - a group of bleeding-heart mercenaries, opportunistic populists, allied African representatives and nationalists, and the bulk of our conscripted Black soldiers who all seek a more equitable, egalitarian, and truly democratic system based more closely on the Roman Senate and their archaic republicanism. Whichever faction wins out, nothing shall change the fact that all in the Congo must kneel before the Consul, for von Rosen’s word is supreme."

Be it their hatred of the Church, the desecration of Holy Sites or the beheading of so many countless faithful, in the minds of all true faithful, the Commune is nothing but a tool of Lucifer to bring ruin upon Christ's Church. So it has been in the mind of Jacques Massu since he was forced to leave the shores of his homeland for this cursed Dark Continent. However, that was before the Congo Crisis, before his rise to leadership over the entirety of the Dark Heart of the Dark Continent.\n Unlike when he was forced to flee, this modern knight now has an army backing him, neigh, a nation! A nation consecrated to every single ideal the Communards view as repugnant. No longer standing alone, the long exiled National French government has an ally in the coming crusade against those beasts in Paris. Soon enough, our knightly companies shall follow the lead of St. Louis IX, leaving these now hollowed shores and fight and die for Christendom, and yet perhaps that is not enough. While yes, the Nationalist government is indeed better then the Communards by all accounts, they are not perfect. They lack a true understanding of Chivalry, they lack the same burning fire that our own men carry with them. It is almost unthinkable, but perhaps the Nationalist has lost the right to rule? After, if Providence truly viewed them fit, He would not have allowed us to rise to power. While this ideas are radical, perhaps even treasonous, they have begun to float around in the lower ranks of our Knightly Order, thus bringing some legitimacy to them. If we truly wish to remain loyal to our Entente Allies, Massu must make a statement regarding them, rejecting them completely, or perhaps embracing them, bringing us on the path of a New Crusade, to liberate our rightful homeland. The choice is Massu's to make."

After the completion of its confection, Massu began to wear his armor on many occasions, such as during the visit of native villages or during one of the many banquets held in Leopoldville.

It is not uncommon for the inhabitants of the Congo to see Dauphiné Massu and General De Gaulle embarking on their iconic jeeps on great safaris across the vastness of the Congolese savannah, challenging each other to hunt as many animals as possible. Back in the capital, Massu and De Gaulle made a habit of chatting and laughing for a long time accompanied by their men, but above all by prostitutes and alcohol of all kinds in abundance at private night parties. During one of these parties, the drunken Dauphiné declared himself a 'Gaullist', a parodic and fictitious political ideology, this joke seems to have become a running gag between the two military commanders, to such an extent that during a recent visit of Charles de Gaulle to the Congo, De Gaulle would have greeted Massu by saying 'So, Massu, are you still stupid?' to which the mercenary replied with a smile 'Still a Gaullist, General!' before hugging the general."

In addition to his usual military attire, the Dauphiné seems to have grown accustomed to wearing typical medieval clothing such as robes and garments of the time, sometimes even wearing full metal armor imported directly from France, his men wondering how on earth he manages to endure the heat of the Congo while dressed in such a way. At the suggestion of the faithful Raoul Salan, Massu and his men organized large banquets and typically medieval celebrations where lords and natives dressed in many unusual clothes were present, tasting good wine and food faithfully prepared as in medieval times while listening to the troubadour singing medieval songs.\n\nThese measures proved popular among both the people and the nobility and allowed Massu to spread French culture to the Congo more effectively."

Local mercenary leaders have been granted varying land plots across the nation in exchange for their loyalty to Massu. These new “lords” have near-total control over their realms; they often enlist those who live in their lands as serfs to construct massive fortifications, castles, and other edifices. Natives have nearly no say in local dealings as native women are taken as wives by the lord and his company, and mercenary lords often employ their own retinues; armies and knight orders often pledge fealty to their lords instead of the Dauphiné directly. However, while the local lords have great power in their own realms, they still pale in comparison to Massu. Every lord still pays tribute to the Dauphiné, his domain being the vastest by far, and the lords do his bidding without question. If Massu calls them to war, those in his employ follow. This modern feudalist system has become the bedrock of the Congo’s new society, as if time itself has been reversed here in the Dark Heart of Africa."

It does not take long to find people in need; almost every family, every person in this wartorn nation has been affected one way or another. Suffering has become synonymous with living in the Congo; every man had raised a rifle towards another, every resource of the heart of Africa had been utilized towards the war effort. While Kinshasa has seen a great deal of humanitarian aid, the more inland areas of the country have been difficult to support. Our detail to the river city of Kindu was escorted by a platoon of Vrijstaat army men. Oddly, they were clothed in ragtag garments and protection. We thought it was truly unfitting of an army. As we ventured across the country to reach the river city, we passed by odd sights. Enlisted natives were toiling away while being watched by white overseers, which is not unexpected of the Belgians, but they were erecting massive fortifications and walls instead of cultivating crops. The massive giants of stone reminded me of the bastions made in Europe centuries ago. A puzzling sight! Is the war not over? \n\n We requested to visit one of the edifices that were being constructed, and our security detail reluctantly assented. The makeshift door was opened by a native woman, who quietly lead us to see the leader of the homestead. The man put on a toothy smile but was visually concerned with our arrival. He kissed what I can only assume to be his wife before telling her to leave, and upon hearing our questions about the nature of this construction project, he answered, in broken French, that it was simply an “infrastructure” project and offered no further elaboration. He offered us hospitality for the night and had native servants lead us to our rooms. Mr. Delegate, I sense that there is something more to meets the eye down here in the heart of Africa. It seems as if the Belgians have gone back in time, choosing to revert to feudalism as these “lords” of fiefdoms, with natives acting as serfs. I fear that we, the world, are being deceived. \n\nArthur Arquette \n\n The note was torn from the humanitarian worker’s shaking hands and taken to the lord’s room. He paused on it for a moment, before throwing it into the crackling fireplace next to him. "

In the pitch below him, two of his personal guards adorned shining armor and prepared for the next bout, for Massu had organized a national jousting tournament to name his new champion. Though the brave merc to receive this entirely ceremonial title shall gain little besides fame and a substantial prize purse, what this tournament shall do for the wider nation is far more important. \n\nServing as the inaugural event for the Dauphiné’s planned cultural renaissance, Massu hopes to vibrantly revive the storied culture and traditions of old medieval France to serve as a new, uniting culture and identity for our ragtag group of international mercenaries. Not just reviving mere games, Massu has pushed to revive old traditions in art, music, cuisine, and other aspects of daily life in an attempt to truly revive the long-dead idyll of Dark Ages France. To entice his local artists who have been hard at work decorating and adorning his new throne room with beautiful scenes of royal and Christian imagery, Massu has had Enguerrand Quarton’s famous ‘The Coronation of the Virgin’ secretly and quietly procured for an exorbitant fee from some sly museum workers in Southern France looking to make a quick buck, placing it behind his ‘throne’ as an imposing visage to all who enter his chamber. Taking his gaul and delusion further, Massu had even ordered local artists to paint over the face of the Virgin Mother, replacing it with his own grimacing mug without second thought to the masterwork he was ordering to be defiled. \n\nContinuing his bastardization of medieval French culture, Massu has instructed a band of local Baluba musicians to be his personal minstrels, forcing them to play on lutes and other archaic instruments as the jousting tournament was underway. With the stands filling and the first bout about to begin, the Dauphiné rocked back into his seat and exclaimed ‘Let the games begin!’ as the riders bolted towards each other, lances lowered and shields braced to take the coming blow. With the crash of their collision, Massu’s renaissance had begun, and now only time would tell if his gamble at a new Congolese culture pays off."

Choosing to emulate the Roman Republic of Old, von Rosen lead an assembly for four days to decide the details of his new Congolese state.

Consul von Rosen has announced to all the ace pilots of the world that an air-race was to be held in the Congo in one month, and that any and all were welcome to partake. The rules of the race are simple: the first one to fly from Leopoldville to Stockholm and back would be the winner. To keep it sportsmanlike and fair, no weapons of any kind were allowed to be used during the race, though military craft themselves were allowed to be flown. With famous pilots such as Italo Balbo, Charles Lindbergh, Amelia Earhart, James Doolittle, Noel Wien, Ivan Kozhedub, Constantin Cantacuzino, Jean Mermoz, Erich Hartmann, Charles Yeager, Mannfred von Richtofen, Hans Wind, Shoichi Sugita, and even von Rosen’s own uncle-in-law Hermann Göring already replying to the call to race with a resounding yes.

Lagging behind this lead pack was von Rosen’s notorious Uncle-in-law, Hermann Göring, who had engine stall issues due to his plane’s load being above recommended flight weight. Upon learning that von Rosen had finished the race before him, the morphine-riddled madman flew back to his home in Dar-Es-Salaam, frothing at the mouth in a rage over his loss. The race did not go off without a hitch however, for tragically one of the racers - the American Ms. Earhart - disappeared during the return leg of the trip, with the other racers losing radio contact with Amelia as they passed over the Sahara. Despite this tragedy, von Rosen has taken his victory in stride, but not without sending search parties back along the route to search for the missing pilot, who is expected to be found in short order due to reports of an American pilot being held at a local hospital in Chad. Regardless, the race has been a success, and Consul von Rosen has once again proven himself as the greatest pilot in the world."

After years of service and repairs, the Hanny has become a beast of machinery that only von Rosen knows how to handle. Many have tried to steal this black beast, but none have even been able to get it started, for they do not have the Consul’s magic touch. Having far more modified parts than factory standard ones, repairing this able beast has been a pain for von Rosen, forcing him to go to greater lengths to repair the old girl due to his refusal to return home to Sweden and ask his family to use their company ties with SAAB to get fresh parts. Flying the Hanny has honed von Rosen into one of the greatest pilots the world has ever seen, and with his constant need to fix his aircraft, he has become one of the most experienced mechanics around as well. \n\nWith the piston they needed secured in his satchel and with the local gendarmerie hot on their trail, von Rosen and Johanna were forced to hide out in Luanda for over a week, passing the time by enjoying the vibrant nightlife of city that had become their prison. Once everything had died down, the two made their way back to their landrover, which they had tucked away and covered in camonets in a nearby coastal cave, and made their trek back to Leopoldville, all the while von Rosen pieced together in his head exactly how he would have to fix the Hanny even without any diagrams or the engine itself in front of him, for every inch and facet of that plane was burned into the Consul’s head."

The air is thick with moisture as a local militia trodded through the foliage of the jungle. Yet, today was the day that the sun blazed even hotter than before. Verdant swathes of the jungle were lit ablaze in an orange hue almost instantaneously, as man, tree, animal, and rifle alike were all inundated by flames. An unholy cacophony of torture erupted from those caught in the crossfire, for wildlife and man alike screamed in pain as if they were subject to the tortures of purgatory. To them, it probably felt like they were already in Hell, even before they had died. The Hällstrom regime in the west of the Congo had begun to deploy peacekeeping forces in order to control the relatively unruly east and had employed a new type of flame technology. Dubbed the foxhound, a mixture of gel and gasoline allows the flames to cling onto anything it contacts, meaning a certain, slow, and painful death for anyone in its tracks. May God have mercy on those that the foxhound preys upon, for they will see him shortly."

outerheaven.22.d:0 "Despite the heroic victory of our mercenary brotherhood in the Congo Crisis, and despite great consolidation efforts undertaken by the ruling regime, the Congo is far from a united and stable political entity. Though merc patrols are a common sight anywhere in our lands and interactions between our forces and the natives are frequent, we are far from fully in control of this nation, with most of the Congo functioning with just their own local and independent governments. Our centers of influence and power exist as mere islands in a vast and swirling maelstrom of chaos and uncertainty that has consumed the Congo, and we are woefully unaware of a great deal that happens within our barley-regulated borders, truly making this quagmire the Darkest Heart of the Dark Continent. Most of the people within our nation do as they please, administered by governments and authorities with little to no ties to our regime. It shall be the greatest test of our brotherhood’s strength and power to see if we truly can get a handle on this wild expanse, and we must act quickly, for the vultures and hyenas are already circling our glorious mercenary state, so we must be ready to defend it at all costs from any threat, foreign or domestic."

outerheaven.23.t:0 "Sons of Liberty"
outerheaven.23.d:0 "Since the mercenaries and Hallstorm took control of the Congo, the country has been radically transformed from an unstable colony into a true mercenary paradise, Outer Haven. In addition to the mercenaries already present in the Congo before and during the war, from all over the world, men, more or less known but all equally ambitious, come to try their luck in this paradise, whether for wealth, glory, adventure or any other reason, most of them coming from Europe or America but that does not prevent exceptions. Recently a man of Japanese origin arrived at Mother Base like so many other mercenaries, little is known about him, except that he is a former soldier for the Japanese Imperial Army who decided to launch a career as a mercenary. Only known by his code name 'Solid Snake', he has distinguished himself in several infiltration missions, he even managed to impress the Big Boss himself who invited him to meet him. They supposedly talked a lot, a conversation during which Hallstorm got to know the mysterious Japanese, especially that he is passionate about robotics and cinema, he told Hallstorm about one of his projects named 'Metal Gear' which could supposedly create robots that can be used as weapons, the Big Boss was obviously reluctant to this idea but encouraged the young man to pursue his dreams."

outerheaven.24.d:0 "Miss E is undoubtedly one of Outer Heaven’s most seasoned and yet most mysterious figures. Her skill with weapons, especially pistols and sniper rifles and numerous exploits in the fighting within the Congo have made her a subject of admiration by many of Outer Heaven’s mercenaries and of fear by her enemies. Few other than the Boss himself know of her past other than her being Finnish and very close to Hallström. Born Verna Erikson, Miss E was a student at the Helsinki University of Technology noted for her unusual affinity for weapons and action, which is why she was a perfect fit to become a smuggler when the Finnish Civil War broke out. She and her classmate, Salme Setala, both held fervently conservative and anti-communist views and so served valiantly for the White Guard in the Finnish Civil War, earning themselves the Order of the Cross of Liberty. Her weapons smuggling efforts led her to deal many times with the pro-White Swedish Brigade, led by none other than Gustaf Hallström. Hallström was impressed by Erikson’s competence with weapons and even allowed her to occasionally work with the Brigade in combat. An image of her carrying three bandoliers and a pistol on her chest made her an icon in Finland. As the fighting died down, Erikson convinced Hallström to allow her to join him in his service in Siberia and his eventual time in Africa. After claiming she had cancer and leaving the country, the Finnish people came to believe she had died of her illness. In actuality, Erikson continued her work with Hallström, gradually becoming more seasoned and competent in warfare as the two adventured, culminating in them joining the Mercenaries in the Congo. Now just called Miss E, no one is  as purely dedicated to the Boss or as influential in Outer Heaven as she."

outerheaven.25.t:0 "A Main Language for Our Brotherhood"
outerheaven.25.d:0 "Language is an issue that is becoming increasingly problematic within Outer Heaven’s ranks. The Boss is a Swede, and his first language is Swedish. Many soldiers speak French or German as a result of the Belgian and German influence over the Congo. Others have not adopted the languages of the colonials, and speak only their native language, often Kikongo or Lingala. As our army grows, so too do the number of languages spoken within it. Angolans and British mercenaries are some of the fastest growing groups in our army, and oftentimes they speak only Portuguese and English. Communication is a key factor in maintaining any successful military, and we cannot afford to let ourselves become weakened by linguistic barriers. Therefore, the Boss and his key staff have decided to introduce an official language for Outer Heaven. French will be required for officers and used to deliver and receive orders and by administration, though the Boss has insisted that his high-ranking staff use Swedish. However, a debate has emerged regarding whether French should be required learning for the natives. While it is agreed that the natives be allowed to continue using languages such as Kikongo, Lingala and Swahili, many believe that the natives should be forced to pick up French to communicate with mercenaries and administrators. The decision lies with the Boss."

Flying back as fast as he could to address the emergency, Hallström was initially devastated to see the base empty, minus the wail of sirens and the occasional firework. The feeling was quickly replaced with confusion, then pleasant surprise when the singing of “Happy Birthday” began. Though a bit crude with the different languages used by the Before he knew it, the troops were rolling out a magnificent cake with Outer Heaven’s emblem on it. Showered with gifts of cigars, letters of appreciation, wishes of a happy birthday, and food he enjoyed, the steel-hearted Hallström failed to hold back tears. His emotional state meant that the men had the beautiful but seasoned Finnish sniper, known only as “Miss E”, light his cigar. Hallström cutting the cake with his saber was filmed, followed by the Boss taking many photos with his troops. By the end of the long celebrations, virtually the entire base had passed out from drinks, dozens of magazines had been unloaded in celebratory shooting events, and Hallström cried enough to fill buckets."

outerheaven.27.t:0 "A Difficult Choice"
outerheaven.27.d:0 "Outer Heaven teams have completed their newest campaign, which saw them sent into Tshikapa, a diamond mining town. Approached by a former Union Miniere official with an offer allowing the Mercs free pick of the loot  if the local garrison in Tshikapa were stamped out, the Boss deployed to do just that, for the allure of free diamond and treasure was too good to pass up. If the official needed a thorn in his side removed, the mercenaries would be more than happy to do so. However, after initial clashes in the town, even the most seasoned of our troops were disturbed to find the garrison was largely defended by child soldiers of the Luba, a people long exploited for brutal labor by the Belgians. Though the untrained, Ill-equipped child soldiers with dismal aim posed little serious threat to the hardened mercenaries, the firefights between our mercs and these children quickly ceased as many of the men refused to engage the child soldiers. Until given further orders with how to treat the soldiers from the Boss, they refuse to fight. What does the Boss decree?"

outerheaven.28.t:0 "A Hasty Exit"
outerheaven.28.d:0 "Tshikapa lay quiet, the contract completed. The men spoke no words, perhaps too horrified with their actions to voice any utterance themselves. Administrators, many of whom attempted to flee as their protection was eliminated, were chased down and killed. The Luba laborers, many of them also women and children that were likely no strangers to action themselves, begged for mercy. Seeing no further immediate need for bloodshed, Hallström ordered the laborers be ignored as the men gathered up the diamonds, disposed of the dead, and left the town as quickly as they came to it. Even so, Tshikapa was devastated. The laborers may have at least been free from the cruel labor, but that light was overshadowed by the horrors of the day that left their home nearly devoid of life. As they departed, the troops stared at what remained of the town, their blank expressions hiding whatever emotions they felt. The official gave them a bonus for their efforts."
outerheaven.28.a:0 "No one spoke of it again."

outerheaven.29.t:0 "A Warm Exit"
outerheaven.29.d:0 "At some cost to their ranks, the Mercenaries successfully secured the town with only two of the garrison falling, with the rest being stunned or surrendering. Local administrators overseeing the horrific mining operations were killed on the spot, with a few not-so-lucky industrialists being interrogated first. The Luba laborers were initially hesitant, unsure of how to treat the mercenaries that defeated their brothers and sons with so little violence, something they had come to expect from the foreigners ever since the reign of Leopold II. It wasn’t until one mercenary, a Western Luba speaker himself, approached them, and gently assured them that they were now free. The laborers began to cheer for the troops and assisted them in their extraction of the diamonds. No more mining, no more brutal labor. Many of the soldiers who wrote in their journals hope that the town could establish a new administration, and move on from its past. After all, the people seemed content with the promises of the mercenaries that they were taking the enemy soldiers back to base, where they would be given a better life. Though the contract had been ruined, the troops looked joyous as they took the prisoners from the garrison back to the planes and said goodbye to Tshikapa."

That night, the Boss and his top staff held a meeting, where he announced his plans to further train and develop the Luba child soldiers to reach their potential as some of Outer Heaven’s finest soldiers. Hallström was genuinely surprised when he faced resistance from his staff, with one arguing that the children were far too weak to become proper troops. Other staff reminded the Boss of the “No Angels in Heaven” policy, that Outer Heaven was not the place for the weak who had no future behind a gun. The Boss scoffed, reminding his staff that this training would be no mere daycare, it would be a means to allow the young soldiers to answer a higher calling and become true warriors. However, the Boss was silenced into contemplation when Miss E retorted that the kids deserved to be free to decide their own fates, rather than being forced to continue the painful journey that the soldier's life has already presented them. The debate has gone quiet, and the Boss must make his final decision. Does Outer Heaven have a place for the child soldier?"

outerheaven.31.d:0 "Today the Boss has announced to the world that after great toil and effort, the center of our Heaven - Mother Base, is complete. The city of Leopoldville has been completely transformed into the headquarters for our state. No longer is Mother Base just a name, it is something bigger, a place. Along the Congo River, newly erected platforms stand tall, as if reaching out toward the Lord's heaven. These platforms host each one of the eleven bureaucratic departments of our regime - the Combat, Security, Development, Science, Medical, Intelligence, Diplomatic, Justice, Commerce, Logistics, and Propaganda Units. The main government facility, a 122 meter behemoth known as the Tower Building, is still in progress, but construction is continuing at a swift rate. Other infrastructure has also been altered to suit our designs for Mother Base. Matadi-Kinshasa railway and ports in the city have been militarized. To accommodate the influx of soldiers, fortifications and barracks constructed by the Force Publique have expanded into the "no mans land" area of the city which separated whites and blacks. With development of the city mostly complete and military affairs are prioritized over traditional economic activity, most residents and commercial interests have been forcibly relocated to the outskirts of the city or to Boma. What has resulted is nothing short of a marvel, the soldier's haven. Our railway, ports, airport, facilities, and infrastructure have all been tailored and designed with the soldier in mind.  Every man in uniform has a place here. With our boys joined by key personnel in the Boss' government, we have built the first community without borders, ideologies or isms, with no regard to age, gender, nationality or race. As Mother Base thrives, more and more Forward-Operating Bases are being constructed across the Congo. These smaller hubs for our soldiers will ensure that the Boss' will is carried out to the letter across our domain. Some may dismiss Mother Base and her extensions as a mere fortress or glorified barracks. We know better. She is our home."

However, that has been a small price to pay, for many of these self-organized squads have performed feats and completed missions few others would be able to attempt, let alone succeed and return back to base safely. However, one such squad has risen above all others in recent months due to their unorthodox tactics, unfettered bravery, and cowboy style - the infamous gang of misfits and outlaw veterans known as the M-Team. \n\nOfficially designated as ‘Special Strike Force - Mercenary Squad One’, the M-Team as they are affectionately referred to are a small group of former US Army Rangers that fled the fractured United States after being accused of a crime they did not commit while under the command of Federalist forces during their recent civil war. After being court-martialed and sent to different military prisons, the group each broke out from their holding cells before rendezvousing in Mexico to begin their careers as international soldiers of fortune. Led by the charismatic and ingenious Colonel John ‘Hannibal’ Smith and his loyal officers Lieutenant ‘Faceman’ Peck, Captain ‘Howling Mad’ Murdock, and Sergeant ‘Bad Attitude’ Baracus, the M-Team traveled far and wide across the globe in their customized armored 1940 Ford van as they hired themselves out to causes and jobs they found to be noble or well-paying enough to take on, eventually coming to the Congo and into the service of [root.getleader].

Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to source a few models by selling the Germans uranium ore from our deepmines at Shinkolobwe, allowing us to utilize these new wonder weapons in our operations, with most being used for transport while others have been outfitted as experimental gunboats. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, Hafner rotabuggies, zeppelins, airplanes, experimental jets, gliders, tank-gliders, and other novel transports devised by the crafty Europeans, we shall be able to ferry our mercs and our supplies all around the Dark Heart of Afrika without issue or delay.

Everything at our disposal from the newest radio technologies to simple telegrams and messenger pigeons shall link together our cadre, allowing us to grow our influence and further spread our strengthening facade.

Under his rule, the Congo shall be transformed into Massu’s own personal feudalist fiefdom, based around a mercenary-noble class that serves as the landowners, with other allied native chiefs and colonial remnants serving as subordinate ‘lords.’ Under this system, the Congo shall fuse modernity with tradition, forming a new knightly state here in the dark heart of Africa."

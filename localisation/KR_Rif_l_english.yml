### Focuses ###
RIF_focus:0 "Rifian Focus Tree"

RIF_Abd_El_Krim_Returns:0 "Return of Abd el-Krim!"
RIF_Abd_El_Krim_Returns_desc:0 "The Spaniards tremble in fear, for their worst fears have come to pass. Abd el-Krim, the internationally famous rebel fighter, has returned from his long exile in Egypt to lead the armies of the Riffian tribesmen against their Iberian oppressors. The spirit of Annual beats in their hearts, the silenced screams of their lost relatives and friends from a war decade prior calling for them in a bid for vengeance. The drums of war beat in the Rif again, and the crescented banner of the Rif Republic flies over these desolate lands once more. The colonials in Ceuta and Melilla tremble with fear, as the liberation of Maghreb shall begin in earnest."

RIF_Put_Minas_del_Rif_to_Use:0 "Profits of Minas del Rif to the People"
RIF_Put_Minas_del_Rif_to_Use_desc:0 "The Spanish company Compañía Española de Minas del Rif, or more colloquially, simply Minas del Rif, has long exploited these lands of ours for iron and other ore, through a deal brokered with the illegitimate pretender Bou Hamara at the dawn of the century. Tribal workers have always been treated badly by their Spanish masters, and the profits of these mines have gone into the pockets of corrupt tycoons such as the Spanish political mastermind Count of Romanones. As our people have starved and struggled, the Spanish elites have lined their pockets through our suffering, and such insolence may no longer stand. Minas del Rif will be seized forcefully, to better support the fledgling Riffian economy. At least the Spanish machines can help us for once, even if their original masters paid no heed to the locals."

RIF_Convert_Regulares_to_Our_Side:0 "Turn the Regulares on Their Masters"
RIF_Convert_Regulares_to_Our_Side_desc:0 "The Regulares irregular forces utilized by the Spaniards as a local military and police force have been used as shock troops by their masters for as long as the units have existed, and while the good wages provided by the Spaniards have made many Regulares happy to sell their souls to the Madrid devils, this is no longer the case under the protectorate. As such, many Regulares have little actual loyalty left to the High Commissioner of Northern Morocco, and see Abd el-Krim’s rebellion as a way to finally get rid of the Spanish boot ruling over them. Some will of course remain as lapdogs of the colonial order, but many have thankfully seen the truth and swapped sides to our righteous cause, and they shall be richly rewarded in turn."

RIF_Temporary_Alliance_with_Pretender:0 "Shaky Alliance With the Moroccans"
RIF_Temporary_Alliance_with_Pretender_desc:0 "Abd el-Krim is hardly an ally of the Moroccan sultan, and while he was nominally loyal to the monarch in the first Rif war, his ideals of republicanism have evolved since then. Casablanca regime considers him little more than a liability, but if there is one last thing Abd el-Krim and the Sultan have in common, it is a deep-seated hatred for the Spaniards in Northern Morocco, and if this similar enemy is enough for a few guns and crates of ammunition, it is worth exploiting."

RIF_Arms_from_the_Internationale:0 "Vague Promises for Internationale Weapons"
RIF_Arms_from_the_Internationale_desc:0 "Abd el-Krim is hardly a socialist in any capacity, but he sees the Internationale as a capable partner, and has in the past worked with them in numerous ways to secure aid for his regime. While the Internationale support was relatively limited during the original Rif War, Robert Gordon-Canning has been sent to help facilitate the new Rif Republic regime during these difficult first months. Gordon-Canning, a member of the Maximist clique from the Union of Britain, supported Rif’s plight even back in 1925, and has remained a stalwart ally of el-Krim ever since. We must work through this intermediary to get further Internationale support in the form of guns, ammunition and possibly even vehicles."

RIF_Contact_Cairo_and_Istanbul:0 "Overtures to Cairo and Istanbul"
RIF_Contact_Cairo_and_Istanbul_desc:0 "During his long stay in Alexandria, Abd el-Krim became well-versed in the ways of the Levantine states, from Egypt to the giant of the Ottomans, and while he generally aligns with the young sultan Farouk and his modernized Islamic direction, Abd el-Krim has always admired the Ottoman leader Kemal Pasha and during the first Rif Republic attempted to implement a Kemalist program into his new state. As such, while the Cairo-Istanbul relations are more tense than ever, Abd el-Krim has wisely decided to not pick a side, and instead courts the two rivals for every scrap of support they can lob towards his new rebellious realm."

RIF_True_Moroccan_Republicanism:0 "Islamic Republicanism of Morocco"
RIF_True_Moroccan_Republicanism_desc:0 "Morocco has had a sultan since time immemorial, and every invading European colonialist has always implemented some form of local rule, either through the Jalifas of Spanish Morocco or through direct Sultan rule, such as in the case of the French and Germans. However, Abd el-Krim sees no future in continued monarchist presence, and in his eyes, only through true republicanism, faithful to the values of Islam, can the people of Rif become free. Just like he did during the first Rif war, so too shall the Republic of the Rif rise, under its rightful leader, until the sword is put in its scabbard and the flag of the republic rises over all of Morocco."

RIF_Remembering_Annual:0 "Spirit of Annual to Guide Our Men"
RIF_Remembering_Annual_desc:0 "The battle of Annual was the greatest triumph of the Riffian against the Spaniards and their traitorous allies within the local population. General Manuel Fernández Silvestre committed his inexperienced metropolitan troops against the loyal and battle-hardened warriors of Abd el-Krim, resulting in a total slaughter that would cause the end of the Spanish regime and the coup of Primo de Rivera. The battle showed the world that the Riffians were committed to destroying every last Spanish outpost and company on Moroccan soil to gain their independence, and that they possessed the means to do so. This spirit of defiance and martial might shall be our guiding line in battles against Spanish remnants and internal enemies, wherever they may arise, and like Silvestre, failure to respect our strength will only end in tears."

RIF_Proclaim_the_Jihad:0 "Proclaim a New Rifian Jihad"
RIF_Proclaim_the_Jihad_desc:0 "Our war against the Spaniards is nothing short of a true Jihad, a struggle for the liberation of these proud and beautiful lands from the influence of the German, the Spaniard and the Frenchman. No imperialist shall be allowed to remain where their kind do not belong, and with our faith in Allah on our side, the divine and righteous forces shall assemble to drive the godless colonials to the sea. As we did in 1925, so we shall proclaim a Jihad against the Spaniards once more, to rally further support from over the borders from Morocco and the French territories, where many Berbers will hear the clarion call and join forces with us once more."

RIF_Contact_Red_Cross:0 "Rebellion Flows to the Golden River"
RIF_Contact_Red_Cross_desc:0 "In order to ensure that the Spanish will never be able to strike our lands again, the new Rif government must make moves to gather loyalty from the Spanish Sahara, or Rio de Oro region. While sparsely populated and of little value, it is nonetheless a location with a port and the Spaniards could easily use it as a staging ground for further attacks on Rif from the Atlantic side. The local population of Rio de Oro is hardly too fond of the Spaniards, and while the support they may provide is rather small, any help is welcome in the struggle for freedom."

RIF_Reorganize_Rif_Government:0 "Second Democratic Government of Rif"
RIF_Reorganize_Rif_Government_desc:0 "Many doubt if Abd el-Krim is truly the republican he claims to be, and some even think that he seeks the throne of Morocco for himself, but the rebel leader seeks nothing more than to liberate his people from all imperialists. However, el-Krim’s authoritarian tendencies are hardly a secret, and to placate his numerous enemies, the Rif republic shall announce that the first democratic elections in the republic will be held after final victory against Spain, with the local parties in Tetouan allowed to participate as well in exchange for support during the revolt against Spain."

RIF_Enforce_Tribe_Loyalty:0 "Enforce Loyalty Among Cabilas"
RIF_Enforce_Tribe_Loyalty_desc:0 "The Kabilas of Rif represent the different local groups, tribes and other societal organisms who are scattered over the rough terrain of the region and largely administer themselves with only small inputs from the central government or colonial authority. Due to this decentralised nature of these kabilas, their loyalty to the rebellion is often suspect at best and outright unknown at others. However, if we are to succeed against the blasted Spaniards, then a degree of centralisation and oversight must be introduced to the region so that local governors, caids, do not start to get ideas of how much the Spaniards would be willing to pay for a slight shift in their commitment to liberation."

RIF_The_Republic_Lives_On:0 "European Dominance Over Rif Fades!"
RIF_The_Republic_Lives_On_desc:0 "The time has come, liberation has arrived to Rif. The European colonial dogs have been driven to the sea, and even their disgusting hives in Ceuta and Melilla are ours. The dream of Abd el-Krim has been achieved, or at least a part of it. The dead of the first Rif War are avenged, and now, our eyes turn inwards, to the consolidation of the new republic and its first elections."


RIF_The_Protectorate:0 "Lone Garrison Among the Dunes"
RIF_The_Protectorate_desc:0 "For a second time in less than a decade, another disaster hits the Spanish Protectorate of Northern Morocco. The Spanish mainland is engulfed in a war of immense proportions, and the Kingdom that mere moments ago ruled over these lands is now on its last legs, with a dim hope of recovery. All around the protectorate, wolves circle with hungry gazes, from the Moroccan state to the rebels of Abd el-Krim, the bandits of Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli and the infiltrators of the Internationale. There is little time left to shore up defences and prepare for the inevitable showdown against our many enemies, but every little scrap of resources will be spent for the great war against chaos. The protectorate will hold, even if it has to do so alone."

RIF_Question_of_Jalifa:0 "Reevaluating Our Alliance with the Jalifa"
RIF_Question_of_Jalifa_desc:0 "The Jalifa is a local leader who oversees much of the legislative sectors of the protectorate and is roughly equivalent to a sultan in the territories of the protectorate. However, the current Jalifa Moulay al Hassan Ben el Mehdi has been using the precarious situation of the protectorate to further increase his power, and if the protectorate is to survive, such power plays must be dealt with swiftly and without complications."

RIF_Secure_Ifni:0 "Contact the Tiradores de Ifni"
RIF_Secure_Ifni_desc:0 "Tiradores de Ifni are a small but formidable unit of light infantry recruited from the territory of Sidi Ifni, a small Spanish-controlled enclave off the Moroccan coast. They are currently struggling even more than the Rif government, given the increasingly emboldened ambitions of the Moroccan sultan towards retaking the areas colonized by Spain, but if all forces loyal to Spain band together, perhaps we can stop any Moroccan attempts to utilize our weakness for their gain."

RIF_Rally_the_Regulares:0 "Muster the Moor Regulares"
RIF_Rally_the_Regulares_desc:0 "The Regulares, or Fuerzas Regulares Indígenas, are local troops recruited from Riffian tribesmen, Moroccan citizens and sometimes, even Saharan nomads. Their reputation in mainland Spain is a grim one, given their frequent use as ruthless and brutal shock troops, and this reputation is hardly less infamous in the Rif either. However, given the difficult situation the protectorate finds itself in, we must ensure that these indigenous troops do not get any ideas of rebellion, or otherwise our rule here is finished. Thankfully, Regulares leader Mohammed Mezziane has time and time again shown his loyalty to the crown of Spain, and it is hoped that he does not get new ideas under the protectorate either."

RIF_Bribe_Krims_Allies:0 "Loyalty Through Golden Coins"
RIF_Bribe_Krims_Allies_desc:0 "Abd el-Krim may hold a position of a folk hero, and many tribal leaders have sworn undying loyalty to the Riffian leader, but as always, tribal politics are hardly a simple affair. While many are interested in the prospect of Riffian independence, they also fear Abd el-Krim’s dominance in the movement, and especially the more conservative sectors of the Rif tribal politics view him as a dangerous radical. As such, with a bit of generous allocation of the protectorate’s resources towards improving the life quality of these fence-sitter tribals, we could have ourselves a rather strong ally, or at the very least, one less enemy to fight."

RIF_Hunt_for_Raisuli:0 "Final Extinction of the Barbary Pirates"
RIF_Hunt_for_Raisuli_desc:0 "Mulai Ahmed er Raisuli, also known by the moniker Eagle of Zinat, is less troublesome to the protectorate’s authorities than the accursed el-Krim, but his band of thieves, ruffians and murderers is nonetheless a threat waiting to be neutralized. During the original Rif war, he helped us fight el-Krim, but since his delusions of grandeur had not been compensated in the ludicrous scope he expected, he turned back to crime and has been haunting the Moroccan and Riffian countryside ever since. It is time we banish this spectre of a time long past."

RIF_Crack_Down_on_Smuggling:0 "Smuggler Haven No More"
RIF_Crack_Down_on_Smuggling_desc:0 "One of the primary avenues of crime in the Rif region is the widespread smuggling network, especially with Moroccan tobacco. The roots of this issue lay in the times of the Weltkrieg, when Moroccan tobacco was transported to Europe in large quantities. While the opening of European trade has of course lowered the traffic of smuggling, there are still cases of it happening when it comes to exotic North African goods. What makes this issue so profound is that it is used by Abd el-Krim to finance his rebellion and bring in guns from the continent, usually from the Internationale. This cannot stand, and thus the entire network must be investigated and rooted out if possible."

RIF_Petition_French_Aid:0 "Call Upon the Marechal"
RIF_Petition_French_Aid_desc:0 "The National France regime has always had relatively good relations with Spain, and thanks to their help in the 1920s, the first Rif War was brought to an end when the two front war became too costly for the Riffian rebels. Now that our protectorate finds itself in deep water alone, we must petition Marechal Petain’s state for aid, as the battle against Riffian rebels concerns their colonial state just as much as it does ours. For the sake of all Maghreb, we pray that they see our plight for what it is."

RIF_Tropas_Nomadas:0 "Militarize Tropas Nomadas"
RIF_Tropas_Nomadas_desc:0 "Tropas Nomadas is a relatively freshly established camelry and irregular police unit in Southern Morocco on the territories of Spanish Sahara, recruited mainly from the indigenous population of that desolate land with Spanish officers and non-commissioned officers. While the protectorate mainly relies on the Regulares for military forces, we must militarize the Tropas Nomadas as well, to ensure that in the case of a Moroccan invasion, Spanish Sahara has the means to defend itself and hold out until further aid can be sent."

RIF_Fate_of_the_Canary:0 "Fate of the Canary?"
RIF_Fate_of_the_Canary_desc:0 "The Canary Isles are nominally an integral part of Spain, and have remained so for centuries, but the reality is that they are very detached from the mainland and usually stick to their own matters. However, recently there has been a worrying trend of Canarian nationalism, and with the mainland in chaos, these opportunist separatists may very well attempt their own little rebellion. Given the protectorate’s military might compared to the garrison of the isles, perhaps it is best to bring them under our protection for now."

RIF_True_Loyalties:0 "[RIF_True_Loyalties_loc]"
RIF_True_Loyalties_desc:0 "[RIF_True_Loyalties_desc_loc]"
RIF_True_Loyalties_Normal:0 "Between Burgos and Madrid"
RIF_True_Loyalties_Normal_desc:0 "High Commissioner José Enrique Varela Iglesias is a man of complex loyalties, and while the protectorate has nominally been loyal to Madrid, he holds a great deal of Carlist sympathies as well. As such, many fear that the High Commissioner may reveal his loyalties once he feels confident in his position of power..."

RIF.1.t:0 "Rif Republic Lives Once More!"
RIF.1.d:0 "The time has come to once more cast away the Spanish yoke! The cowardly Spaniards flee from the way of the Riffian patriots, and with the Rif garrison in shambles, Abd el-Krim shall consolidate his republic, fighting to the last man for the future of the Riffian people. The Spanish mainland is in chaos, so a more perfect time could never come, and with the help of our allies in Algeria, Egypt and Istanbul, we will reclaim all of Morocco until a true Islamic and Kemalist republic has been formed here in the edges of the Maghreb. The fight for anti-colonial liberation of all Berbers and Arabs begins here, and we shall carry our duty to the end as we did a decade ago."
RIF.1.a:0 "To victory!"

RIF.2.t:0 "The Burning Sands of Rif"
RIF.2.d:0 "The collapse of Spain finds the small colonial holding of Northern Morocco isolated and in turmoil. When armies wage war on the peninsula, causing untold loss of human life, the Rif finds itself in a similar predicament, with the rebelling tribesmen of Abd el-Krim, the bandits of Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni and the republicans of Tétouanall eyeing the burgeoning military government of José Enrique Varela Iglesias with hungry eyes. The Spanish Legion left for the mainland in a hurry, José Millán-Astray y Terreros as their leader, and general governor Varela was left with a single legionary group and the Regulares under Mohammed ben Mizzian to defend against their numerous enemies. The strongholds of Ceuta and Melilla are the only true holdings Varela controls, with some support from the Jalifa in Tétouan and the local councils of Tangier on the way.\n\nAbd el-Krim may not control as vast of an army as a decade earlier, but the situation is far from ideal either way, and it is only a matter of time until the battle for the control of the protectorate begins in earnest. However, with their numerous enemies mustering against the Protectorate, there is a sign of doubt even among the Spanish loyalists. Governor general Varela, trusted ally of general José Sanjurjo, was given the post partially because of his charismatic and inspiring leadership, but also because the man may possess Carlist sympathies. As such, Spanish officers and administrators loyal to Madrid view him with suspicion, and only time will tell if his true loyalty is to the Alfonsine eagle or the Burgundian Cross. That is, if the Protectorate survives at all..."
RIF.2.a:0 "Things could certainly be better."

RIF.3.t:0 "Fuerzas Regulares Indígenas"
RIF.3.d:0 "The Spanish army in the metropole has always been something of a mixed bag, with very varying quality of officers, weapons and troops posted in different corners of the nation. The lack of good training compounds with the severe drought of good equipment for the army, and many soldiers are little more than servants to their officers, with many being unable to even fire their weapons accurately or service them properly. However, one area where the Spanish army is more than a match for any other European power is in its African units, or Fuerzas Militares de Marruecos as they are known in the military. These troops, hardened by many skirmishes with the Rif rebels and reinforced by the elite troops of the Spanish Foreign Legion, are mainly made up of the tabors of the Regulares, units made up of local Rifian and Moroccan soldiers with most of their leadership made up of Spaniards.\n\nArmed with the best the Oviedo arsenals can offer, the Regulares are primarily infantry troops and often occupy the same role as the Legionaries, with them being used as shock troops. This role does cause quite a bit more casualties to these divisions, but given their experience, the Regulares are some of the only forces in Spain capable of undertaking such a dangerous task. They were used in the capacity during the Asturias rising, where they proved themselves an effective, if not extremely ruthless force, not lessened by the brutal attitude of their commanders such as Juan Yagüe y Blanco and Francisco Franco. The Regulares are primarily made up of infantry, but given the conditions of the Rif, two groups of cavalry are also present. As can be expected from such a valuable unit, they have been awarded nearly as much as the Spanish Legion for their combat prowess, and some, such as Mohamed Meziane, or Mohammed ben Mizzian, have even risen to the rank of Lieutenant General.\n\nThe prestige of these troops and their many actions during wartime have even formed an odd bond between the local troops and their Spanish officers, with many using the connection between Spain and Morocco as a means to explain the fraternal nature between Spanish troops and Rifian Regulares, though despite the close nature of the men and their officers, the Spaniards still hold a very paternalistic view of their troops. With the collapse of the kingdom and the insular situation of the protectorate, many Regulares have defected to the armies of el-Krim, and the remaining ones are viewed with suspicion, especially since Meziane is known to hold a degree of loyalty to the Sultan of Casablanca. Nonetheless, with most Legionaries of Spain fighting on the mainland, Varela must trust the indigenous troops or perish alone."
RIF.3.a:0 "Fiel Regular hasta morir!"

RIF.4.t:0 "Tiradores de Ifni"
RIF.4.d:0 "As the Spanish territories in Africa watch the peninsular tragedy unfold, some territories find themselves far more defended than others. Most importantly, the city of Sidi Ifni, a mere exclave of the larger North African protectorate nestled at the side of the far larger country of Morocco, finds itself in a precarious position. With Spain lost and the protectorate under siege, many fear that the Casablanca regime may try to utilize this weakness to their advantage. However, the Tiradores de Ifni, created by generals Sanjurjo and Franco in 1933 to combat the encroaching Moroccan regime, are always ready to face this threat.\n\nThe Tiradores were modelled after the French Tirailleurs used by the Algiers regime, being light infantry in nature but shock troops in use, with this interest towards a group like this coming from the experience of fighting alongside French Tirailleurs during the Rif War. Similar to the Regulares of Northern Morocco in gear, uniforms and usage, with the only real difference being that the Tiradores wear a tunic named siroquera and have their own star and crescent emblem. These Tiradores are led by a colonel Oswaldo Fernando de la Caridad Capaz y Montes, who has assumed leadership of the Ifni region with the local authorities under direction supervision of High Commissioner Varela.\n\nHowever, Capaz has aroused a degree of suspicion among the most conservative sectors of the Protectorate command, as he is known to hold some republican sentiments even if he has declared his loyalty to the kingdom. As such, while the Tiradores are a welcome addition to the forces of the Protectorate, and hold a great deal of importance in holding the garrison of Sidi Ifni afloat, they are under a lot of surveillance from the Varela loyalists within the colonial administration because of Capaz."
RIF.4.a:0 "Ifni’s loyal sons."

RIF.5.t:0 "Tropas Nómadas del Sahara"
RIF.5.d:0 "The Spanish Sahara or Rio de Oro, as it was originally called, is a remote region with very little actual development or even population to speak of. However, like any region of Spain, it is defended by the Spanish military, and like the much more populous region of Rif, Spanish Sahara mostly employs troops from the local Sahrawi tribesmen. These troops are known as the Tropas Nómadas, an auxiliary force created to patrol the vast deserts of the Golden River. Originally, these lands had a small gendarmerie troop Compañia de Policia a Pie, but it was soon militarised a bit further with the creation of the Tropas de Policia del Sahara, who received camel mounts and patrolled far greater distances than the original group, who mainly guarded the more important coastal regions. Successes with the Tropas de Policia led to the creation of an actual military force with the Tropas Nómadas, with Spanish officers and NCOs as well as a few specialists.\n\nThe creation of such a force was partially inspired by the successes of French army Meharistes as well as the use of the Regulares indigenous force in the Rif, and while the Tropas Nómadas remains a small force, employing mostly locals with knowledge of the terrain and the necessities of survival in these difficult lands, they are proving to be an excellent unit for the task of patrolling the deserts. While there is little of value in the region, some trade routes between Morocco, Mittelafrika’s northernmost territories and the Nationalist French regime do run through Rio de Oro and thus the presences of these police forces does prevent Berbers and other local tribes from preying on trade caravans. Similarly, while Tropas Nómadas is not a true military force and the loyalty of the locals in a time of war is questionable to many Spanish officers, they may act as a first line of defence should Spain find itself at war with the various imperialist powers around itself.\n\nMorocco especially claims Spanish Sahara at its own, so the presence of a police force with rapid response potential in the region does dissuade Casablanca’s king from trying anything. While the experience of these troops is far from that of the regular infantry troops, governor general Varela has had little choice but to bring these camelry troops to the Rif to hunt down the tribesmen of Abd el-Krim and the bandits of er Raisuni, though many fear that they may turn on their Spanish masters all the same."
RIF.5.a:0 "They might not be of the same value as the Regulares but they are something at least."

RIF.6.t:0 "Dealing with the Barbary Pirate"
RIF.6.d:0 "Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni, or the Eagle of Zinat as he is known among his followers, is the leader of the Jebala confederation of Rif tribes, and a man who has become a legend among the Riffians and Moroccans. But to the Spanish administration, he is an old ally and current terror, for his gang plunders the Rif countryside, raids the outposts of colonial order and causes diplomatic incidents with the Moroccan nation to the south of our protectorate. From his youth to this day, Raisuni engages in crime of all sorts, from kidnappings, robberies, piracy to even cattle raiding, the man is always on the move and never far from fat loot. During the first war against the forces of Abd el-Krim, er Raisuni was defeated by Spanish troops and in what could be described as a token of mercy, his group was spared in exchange for support against el-Krim.\n\nHowever, it was not long until he was attacked by the rebellious Riffians and nearly wiped out, managing to escape to the Atlas mountains with a band of loyal men and women to lick his wounds. The bandit lord laid low for years, engaging in petty thievery and occasional attacks on Moroccan, French and Spanish forces, but now, he has grown ever bolder. Perhaps it is the old age catching up to him that makes Raisuni want to go out in a blaze of glory, or perhaps it is the instability of the protectorate, but either way, he has returned like a bad memory to the ranks of the Riffians, rallying the Jebalas once more. Unless swift action is taken, the warlord will become a thorn in the side of the colonial administration, but the amount of effort aimed at curtailing the monster is being debated among the Africanist officers.\n\nBrigadier general José López-Pinto Berizo, leader of the Ceuta artillery unit, has suggested utilizing a small force given the weakened state of er Raisuni’s forces, as sending many of  the thinly-stretched Regulares and Legionaries to destroy a relatively minor threat would leave the Protectorate vulnerable to the forces of el-Krim. However, colonel Miguel López Bravo, who fought er Raisuni before during the Rif War, claims that the Spanish administration cannot underestimate the man, for his fighters and allies are fierce and cunning desert foxes and well-capable of escaping or even destroying a small Spanish force. He views López-Pinto’s plan as overtly cautious and austere, given the threat of er Raisuni, and thus suggests sending at least three times the amount of troops proposed by the brigadier general."
RIF.6.a:0 "Go with López-Pinto plan."
RIF.6.b:0 "Go with López Bravo plan."

RIF.7.t:0 "Massacre at Zinat"
RIF.7.d:0 "The evening sun was scorching the plains of Northern Morocco, when Spanish troops entered the outskirts of the town of Zinat. The birthplace of Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni, it had stood against the decay of time proudly, but the Regulares and Legionaries under Brigadier general José López-Pinto wished merely to see it in ashes, with the head of er Raisuni on a pike as a warning to those seeking a future career in banditry. Yet as the force of a few hundred men flooded into the small village, nestled on a hillside, they found themselves quickly surrounded by Jebala tribesmen. The brigadier general had expected a small force meant to delay the Spaniards as they advanced so that the bandit leader could flee, but what followed was a pitched battle where the desperate Spanish defence at the village square was mercilessly picked at, with Moor and Spanish troops dying from the old firearms of the tribesmen as they darted between streets and attacked from unexpected directions.\n\nFor every Legionary and Regulares riflemen killed, a tribesman or two would be cut down by the Mausers and Astras of the colonials, but it soon became evident that the battle was over for the Spaniards. López-Pinto ordered a retreat but as they attempted to fight their way through the ring of tribal militia, er Raisuni’s personal guard joined the fray, and only a handful of survivors managed to flee the scene, with brigadier general López-Pinto slain by one of the guards. Er Raisuni would escape, and the bloodbath of Zinat would serve as a grim reminder of just how feeble the Protectorate’s grip truly was on the wild lands of the Rif."
RIF.7.a:0 "Mierda!"

RIF.8.t:0 "The Eagle’s Wings Severed"
RIF.8.d:0 "The sun hung low over the desolate Riffian lands, uncaring of the world below as the forces of colonel Miguel López Bravo approached the town of Zinat. The large force of Legionaries and Regulares had completely encircled the town, and after a command from the colonel, Hotchkiss Mle.14 machine guns were set up around the village. The following staccato of gunfire caused some amount of panic among the defenders of the village, and as the Spanish troops began their advance, some of the followers of the Eagle of Zinat fled in terror, only to be cut down by the barrage. Rifle volleys cut down those Riffian troops who attempted to flank the machine guns, and soon it became evident that the ambush planned by er Raisuni’s men was completely foiled.\n\nThe village continued to be hammered by bullets, and er Raisuni among his honour guard attempted a breakout with a charge of cavalry and camels, with the remaining footsoldiers rushing behind them. The charge succeeded at breaking through the ring of defenses, but not before the bandit leader was struck by a burst of lead, sending him tumbling down to the sands he had so long haunted. Their leader’s blood seeping to the ground, the bandits and tribesmen of Zinat escaped, died or surrendered one by one, and the battle came to its predictable conclusion. The Spanish Protectorate and its officials could rest a little easier now that at least one major threat to their rule had been eliminated."
RIF.8.a:0 "Excellent."

RIF.9.t:0 "The Question of the Makhzen"
RIF.9.d:0 "The Spanish Protectorate of Northern Morocco is nominally under the rule of the Moroccan Sultan, Mohammed V, but in truth, the two parts of the Maghreb have been separated ever since the establishment of the Kingdom of Morocco. The true ruler of Northern Morocco is the Spanish-appointed High Commissioner, who oversees all Spanish actions in the protectorate and leads politically with the assistance of colonial departments, such as Indigenous Affairs Development and Finance. However, the legislative work is not within the hands of the High Commissioner, at least de jure, but instead controlled by the joint Moroccan-Spanish appointed Jalifa, who leads the Makhzen, a government of the indigenous Riffians and Moroccans from Tétouan. The Makhzen is again divided into departments of cadis, who run the administration in areas not under direct Spanish rule. However, the current Jalifa Moulay al Hassan Ben el Mehdi, seeing the weakening colonial order, has started to exercise more and more political power on his own, emboldened by the High Commissioner’s plight. The Jalifa has for years acted as a sort of check to the Sultan in Casablanca, with him being a monarch for the Spaniards to justify the existence of the protectorate, even if many Riffians feel a longing to join the larger Moroccan state. If the Jalifa starts getting ideas and delusions of grandeur about his position in the Rif. While he holds little actual power, the local Regulares, Tiradores and Indigenous Police could be lured to support him if he were to openly challenge the Spanish rule. High Commissioner Varela, as a rather authoritarian man conscious of his duty to maintain order in the protectorate, has been watching these developments with concern, and with the help of the emergency cabinet, several plans have been drafted to put an end to the Jalifa’s insolence. The more aggressive faction, made up of younger officers from the Spanish Legion, such as Manuel Díaz Criado, supports cracking down on the Jalifa’s ambitions by completely dismantling the Jalifa system and putting all its responsibilities under the High Commissionary and subsequently, the Spanish colonial departments. The more moderate faction, supported by colonel Oswaldo Fernando de la Caridad Capaz y Montes, suggests that we negotiate with the Jalifa, giving him slightly more oversight on Moroccan matters in exchange for loyalty, with a threat of a crackdown if he fails to comply. Varela generally leans more towards Díaz’s suggestion, but the High Commissioner is open to both approaches nonetheless. "

RIF.9.b:0 "Go with Capaz plan."

RIF.10.t:0 "Tétouan Revolt"
RIF.10.d:0 "Early in the morning, three companies of Spanish-led Regulares marched down the streets of Tétouan, badges, epaulettes and bayonets gleaming in the morning sun. The citizens of the city were woken up to loud orders and the rhythmical thumping of boots as the Spanish Army of Africa made its way to the Jalifa’s palace. The companies, led by captain Manuel Díaz Criado, set in formation before the palace, and upon completion of these maneuvres, Díaz himself climbed the stairs, making an announcement to the gathered soldiers and curious outlookers that the authority of the Jalifa was to be dismantled, the Makhzen closed down and various administrators and local officials brought under the rule of the Spanish High Commissioner Varela. The Jalifa Moulay al Hassan Ben el Mehdi, alerted by the ruckus, demanded to know what had caused such an insult towards the traditional structure of the protectorate, but he was only met by a squad of Regulares who arrested him and various other high-profile members of the court, who were subsequently dragged off the palace by their countrymen serving other masters. However, as the column of soldiers was leaving the city, they were ambushed by a hastily arranged group of civilians, local police and a few Regulares units as well as a small worker’s militia loyal to the Partido Reformista Nacional and al Muslihun groups. The gathered opposition demanded the release of the Jalifa and the return to Moroccan rule, but the situation soon turned ugly after Díaz Criado ordered his forces to disperse the crowd. Shots were fired by both sides, the advancing Regulares were peppered with stones, bricks and rotten vegetables and the streets soon dissolved into utter chaos as the Spaniards and Jalifa loyalists clashed violently. In the midst of the battle, a group of rebel Regulares managed to defeat the Spanish guards of Jalífa el Mehdi and freed him, with the groups fleeing the scene as further escalation of the chaos occurred all around them. The Regulares, due to their superior training and experience, managed to defeat the ambushers after heavy losses, but with the Jalifa on the run and the republicans clearly on his side, the conflict in Tétouan had only just begun."
RIF.10.a:0 "How did they manage to let him escape?"


RIF.11.t:0 "Tétouan Placated"
RIF.11.d:0 "The city of Tétouan had been slipping from Spanish control for quite some time now, and while the local garrison still held the ultimate power in the area, local Spanish officers were rather anxious about the recent moves that Jalifa Moulay al Hassan Ben el Mehdi had been making over the last few weeks. Ever since the isolation of Northern Morocco from the rest of Spain, el Mehdi had been creating alliances and bribing colonial officers for support, and his grip on the city was becoming unchallengeable. However, after colonel Fernando de la Caridad Capaz arrived to negotiate with the Jalifa, these political moves came to an end, for the most part. Capaz, being a moderate man and long-time military leader, had little interest in large schemes or further infighting among the Spanish protectorate’s administration, and had been rather diplomatic about the use of force should the Jalifa attempt.\n\nIt was less so the threat of force and more the promises of further autonomy and administrative freedom that finally placated the Jalifa, and while his loyalty was still nowhere near unquestionable, Capaz’s mission had at the very least prevented one less threat to the protectorate’s regime. Of course, should Spain recover from the terrible civil strife that had overtaken it, the question of Riffian autonomy may very well end in a far less pro-local policies given that Capaz had little actual say in Spanish colonial policy, but this was a bridge to be crossed at a later date. For now, all that mattered was the squashing of Abd el-Krim’s rebellion, and having a semi-loyal Tétouan was certainly a victory in itself. "

RIF.12.t:0 "Question of the Canary"
RIF.12.d:0 "The archipelago of Canary Islands is an integral part of Spain, and while it once may have housed an indigenous population of its own, the Guanches have long since disappeared to the sands of time, assimilated, destroyed or exiled by European colonists. As such, compared to Rif, it possesses few groups aiming to destabilize Spanish rule, but in these dark times, even the smallest dissident group may cause untold damage if left unchecked.Groups such as Frente Único Revolucionario and Partido Nacionalista Canario are filled with dangerous separatists and Canarian nationalists, and while fringe in the grand scheme of things, the war on Spanish soil has shown that the threat of minority nationalists is one that should not be overlooked.\n\nThus, the protectorate administration has suggested that the Protectorate of Spanish Morocco annexed the Canary Islands under its own governance for as long as the Spanish strife is on-going, as the local garrisons in Las Palmas and Tenerife are wholly insufficient in present time to stop an island-wide insurrection. The local governor, Amado Balmes Alonso, has been informed of such plans, and while hesitant to give up his authority, has expressed some degree of interest given the meagre resources he has to work with. However, the decision on whether to go ahead with the plan or not lies with High Commissioner Varela. "

RIF.13.t:0 "Reforge the Pact of Rif?"
RIF.13.d:0 "The war against Abd el-Krim is a near repetition of what occurred in the mid-1920s against the same rebellious Riffians, but this time, the colonial garrison of the Spanish protectorate has no support coming from the mainland. With Spain in turmoil, we must sustain the war support on our own or perish to the bloodthirsty savages of el-Krim. Or so it would seem, but perhaps it must not be the case. The French National State on our western border helped curtail Abd el-Krim’s rebellion the first time as well, and while the state under Marechal Petain has far more to deal with today, given the rather precarious situation in Europe and increased calls among the French exiles to reclaim their birthright on the continent, it is nonetheless in the best interests of the Algiers regime to destroy el-Krim’s rebellion again before he inspires further tribal rebellions among the Berbers and other African tribes under French rule.\n\nAs such, we could send a diplomatic mission by sea or air to Algiers in hopes of receiving industrial, military or political support from the regime there, given the similar aims of our two nations. Some officers, especially among the younger cliques of the army, are rather disinterested in the plan, however, claiming that it would merely make us lapdogs of the Frenchmen. "

RIF.14.t:0 "Reforge the Pact of Rif?"
RIF.14.d:0 "An envoy from Ceuta arrived earlier today to Algiers, representing the rump colonial regime of the Spanish protectorate of Northern Morocco. Speaking on behalf of the colonial High Commissioner, José Enrique Varela Iglesias, the envoy requested aid from the French National State in the quelling of the revolt of Abd el-Krim, the Riffian rebel who already threatened Spanish colonial rule in the mid-1920s and was only crushed after the intervention of the French exiles. This time, the Spaniards are not requesting a full intervention, but merely help with either some additional troops or with industrial matters.\n\nThe situation does concern our regime as well, given that Abd el-Krim is committed to the cause of Berber liberation and in the past sponsored rebels among the French colonial army to support this aim. He is also an ally of the Cairo regime, and thus a threat to French colonial ambitions in Africa. Still, the remaining Spanish administration in the Rif is constantly under siege from various enemy groups, and some within the French government fear that giving them resources at this time would simply hand those weapons and industrial aid to Moroccan rebels.

RIF.20.t:0 "First Elections of the Rif Republic"
RIF.20.d:0 "With the victory over Spanish now clear, the Rifian republic can finally breathe free, saved from the colonialist tendencies of the Europeans by the brave hands of the Harakas and rough tribal warriors of the Atlas mountains. Now, the time has come to hold the first truly free elections of the Rif Republic, much to the surprise of many. Abd el-Krim has never been a man of strong democratic convictions, but in the face of increasing pressure from his allies in Cairo and Internationale, as well as domestic supporters, he caved in and promised free elections to solidify his rule. It is expected that the war hero wins the elections, but this is hardly certain given his low popularity among urban populations. The most ideologically opposing party to his is the Partido Reformista Nacional, led by Abdelhadek Torres, which espouses a vaguely socialist, Pan-Arabist and highly modern form of republicanism.\n\nA more moderate alternative is the al Muslihun group, led by Mohammed Daoud, which aims to create a more intellectually modern republic with a focus on co-operative development and thorough reformation of all institutions in the region. In the centre of Riffian politics alongside Abd el-Krim’s movement is the Partido de Unidad Marroquí led by Mohammed al-Makki al-Nasiri, supporting a reunification with the Moroccan sultanate, reformist and anti-conservative changes to the republic and curtailing of the power of the Muslim Imams. Finally, to oppose the party of Abd el-Krim, the former Jalifa has decided to run in the elections on a monarchist, progressive conservative platform aimed at reconciling with harmless Spaniards and returning to the Makhzen system of governance, though his support remains relatively minimal."

RIF.2.t:0 "The Burning Sands of Rif"
RIF.2.d:0 "The collapse of Spain finds the small colonial holding of Northern Morocco isolated and in turmoil. When armies wage war on the peninsula, causing untold loss of human life, the Rif finds itself in a similar predicament, with the rebelling tribesmen of Abd el Krim, the bandits of Mulai Ahmed er Raisuni and the republicans of Tétouanall eyeing the burgeoning military government of José Enrique Varela Iglesias with hungry eyes. The Spanish Legion left for the mainland in a hurry, José Millán-Astray y Terreros as their leader, and general governor Varela was left with a single legionary group and the Regulares under Mohammed ben Mizzian to defend with against their numerous enemies. The strongholds of Ceuta and Melilla are the only true holdings Varela controls, with some support from the Jalifa in Tétouan and the local councils of Tangier on the way.\n\nAbd el Krim may not control as vast of an army as a decade earlier, but the situation is far from ideal either way, and it is only a matter of time until the battle for the control of the protectorate begins in earnest. However, with their numerous enemies mustering against the Protectorate, there is a sow of doubt even among the Spanish loyalists. Governor general Varela, trusted ally of general José Sanjurjo, was given the post partially because of his charismatic and inspiring leadership, but also because the man may possess Carlist sympathies. As such, Spanish officers and administrators loyal to Madrid view him with suspicion, and only time will tell if his true loyalty is to the Alfonsine eagle or the Burgundian Cross. That is, if the Protectorate survives at all..."
RIF.2.a:0 "Things could certainly be better."

RIF.3.t:0 "Fuerzas Regulares Indígenas"
RIF.3.d:0 "The Spanish army in the metropole has always been something of a mixed bag, with very varying quality of officers, weapons and troops posted in different corners of the nation. The lack of good training compounds with the severe drought of good equipment for the army, and many soldiers are little more than servants to their officers, with many being unable to even fire their weapons accurately or service them properly. However, one area where the Spanish army is more than a match for any other European power is in its African units, or Fuerzas Militares de Marruecos as they are known in the military. These troops, hardened by many skirmishes with the Rif rebels and reinforced by the elite troops of the Spanish Foreign Legion, are mainly made up of the tabors of the Regulares, units made up of local Rifian and Moroccan soldiers with most of their leadership made up of Spaniards.\n\nArmed with the best the Oviedo arsenals can offer, the Regulares are primarily infantry troops and often occupy the same role as the Legionaries, with them being used as shock troops. This role does cause quite a bit more casualties to these divisions, but given their experience, the Regulares are some of the only forces in Spain capable of undertaking such a dangerous task. They were used in the capacity during the Asturias rising, where they proved themselves effective, if not extremely ruthless force, not lessened by the brutal attitude of their commanders such as Juan Yagüe y Blanco and Francisco Franco. The Regulares are primarily made up of infantry, but given the conditions of the Rif, two groups of cavalry are also present. As can be expected from such a valuable unit, they have been awarded nearly as much as the Spanish Legion for their combat prowess, and some, such as Mohamed Meziane, or Mohammed ben Mizzian, have even risen to the rank of Lieutenant General.\n\nThe prestige of these troops and their many actions during wartime have even formed an odd bond between the local troops and their Spanish officers, with many using the connection between Spain and Morocco as a means to explain the fraternal nature between Spanish troops and Rifian Regulares, though despite the close nature of the men and their officers, the Spaniards still hold a very paternalistic view of their troops. With the collapse of the kingdom and the insular situation of the protectorate, many Regulares have defected to the armies of el Krim, and the remaining ones are viewed with suspicion, especially since Meziane is known to hold a degree of loyalty to the Sultan of Casablanca. Nonetheless, with most Legionaries of Spain fighting on the mainland, Varela must trust the indigenous troops or perish alone."
RIF.3.a:0 "Fiel Regular hasta morir!"

RIF.4.t:0 "Tiradores de Ifni"
RIF.4.d:0 "As the Spanish territories in Africa watch the peninsular tragedy unfold, some territories find themselves far more defended than others. Most importantly, the city of Sidi Ifni, a mere exclave of the larger North African protectorate nestled at the side of the far larger country of Morocco, finds itself in a precarious position. With Spain lost and the protectorate under siege, many fear that the Casablanca regime may try to utilize this weakness to their advantage. However, the Tiradores de Ifni, created by generals Sanjurjo and Franco in 1933 to combat the encroaching Moroccan regime, are always ready to face this threat.\n\nThe Tiradores were modelled after the French Tirailleurs used by the Algiers regime, being light infantry in nature but shock troops in use, with this interest towards a group like this coming from the experience of fighting alongside French Tirailleurs during the Rif War. Similar to the Regulares of Northern Morocco in gear, uniforms and usage, with the only real difference being that the Tiradores wear a tunic named siroquera and have their own star and crescent emblem. These Tiradores are led by a colonel Oswaldo Fernando de la Caridad Capaz y Montes, who has assumed leadership of the Ifni region with the local authorities under direction supervision of High Commissioner Varela.\n\nHowever, Capaz has aroused a degree of suspicion among the most conservative sectors of the Protectorate command, as he is known to hold some republican sentiments even if he has declared his loyalty to the kingdom. As such, while the Tiradores are a welcome addition to the forces of the Protectorate, and hold a great deal of importance in holding the garrison of Sidi Ifni afloat, they are under a lot of surveillance from the Varela loyalists within the colonial administration because of Capaz."
RIF.4.a:0 "Ifni’s loyal sons."

RIF.5.t:0 "Tropas Nómadas del Sahara"
RIF.5.d:0 "The Spanish Sahara or Rio de Oro, as it was originally called, is a remote region with very little actual development or even population to speak of. However, like any region of Spain, it is defended by the Spanish military, and like the much more populous region of Rif, Spanish Sahara mostly employs troops from the local Sahrawi tribesmen. These troops are known as the Tropas Nómadas, an auxiliary force created to patrol the vast deserts of the Golden River. Originally, these lands had a small gendarmerie troop Compañia de Policia a Pie, but it was soon militarised a bit further with the creation of the Tropas de Policia del Sahara, who received camel mounts and patrolled far greater distances than the original group, who mainly guarded the more important coastal regions. Successes with the Tropas de Policia led to the creation of an actual military force with the Tropas Nómadas, with Spanish officers and NCOs as well as a few specialists.\n\nThe creation of such a force was partially inspired by the successes of French army Meharistes as well as the use of the Regulares indigenous force in the Rif, and while the Tropas Nómadas remains a small force, employing mostly locals with knowledge of the terrain and the necessities of survival in these difficult lands, they are proving to be an excellent unit for the task of patrolling the deserts. While there is little of value in the region, some trade routes between Morocco, Mittelafrika’s northernmost territories and the Nationalist French regime do run through Rio de Oro and thus the presences of these police forces does prevent Berbers and other local tribes from preying on trade caravans. Similarly, while Tropas Nómadas is not a true military force and the loyalty of the locals in a time of war is questionable to many Spanish officers, they may act as a first line of defence should Spain find itself at war with the various imperialist powers around itself.\n\nMorocco especially claims Spanish Sahara at its own, so the presence of a police force with rapid response potential in the region does dissuade Casablanca’s king from trying anything. While the experience of these troops is far from that of the regular infantry troops, governor general Varela has had little choice but to bring these camelry troops to the Rif to hunt down the tribesmen of Abd el Krim and the bandits of er Raisuni, though many fear that they may turn on their Spanish masters all the same."
RIF.5.a:0 "They might not be of same value as the Regulares but they are something at least."



RIF.20.t:0 "Abd el-Krim’s Ideological Turn"
RIF.20.d:0 "With the victory over Spanish now clear, the Rifian republic can finally breathe free, saved from the colonialist tendencies of the Europeans by the brave hands of the Harakas and rough tribal warriors of the Atlas mountains. However, without the inspiring leadership of Abd el-Krim, this victory could have hardly been a reality, and the Rifian people owe their thanks to him.\n\n Nonetheless, as the guns fall silent and the time of war ends, Rif enters unknown waters as Abd El-Krim must stay true to his word and shift the regime of the Republic to a democratic, representative constitutional republic. Back during the first Rif war, the Rif government was largely made up of youthful modernizers, but due to the terrible losses of that war, during the new revolt against Spain, the regime had to rely on traditionalist tribal structures more than before. As such, Abd el-Krim moderated his rhetoric towards a more conservative and paternalistic outlook, which earned us the support of the more stubborn and anti-modernist tribes. However, the modernist clique within Rif government has demanded that the president adopts more progressive policies to truly live up to the dreams of the original Rif Republic. Rif’s syndicalist allies in the Commune have also urged el-Krim to adopt a more left-leaning tinge to his movement, though this would obviously annoy other allies in the Moroccan nobility."
RIF.20.a:0 "Adopt some syndicalist ideals while keeping our Islamic nature."
RIF.20.b:0 "Modernize the government but without the Commune’s influence."
RIF.20.c:0 "Adopt some liberal measures, while paying overtures to the conservatives."
RIF.20.e:0 "Retain the status quo Paternalist Republicanism."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ISIDORO_AYORA_DESC:0 "Isidro Ramón Antonio Ayora Cueva was born in 1879 in the small Ecuadorian town of Loja. Ayora graduated as a medical surgeon from the 'Universidad Central de Ecuador' in 1905 and, thanks to a scholarship that his uncle Manuel Benigno Cueva got him, went to study to Germany to get his PhD in 1909. He then returned to Quito and founded his own Clinic and became a professor in the Ecuadorian Central University. He gained a well-respected reputation as a medical professional and public figure, even managing to become Mayor for the town of Quito in 1924, and being chosen later as a deputy for his home town. His meteoric rise to popularity was halted by the Conservatives taking over the country, frustrating any attempts by Ayora to become a candidate for President. However, now that he's back in power and leading the PLRE, He'll try to restore the Liberal hegemony that President Eloy Alfaro once had and truly liberalize the Ecuadorian society and economy."
POLITICS_ALFREDO_MORENO_DESC:0 "José Alfredo Wenceslao del Corazón de la Concepción Baquerizo Moreno was born in 1859 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He went to highschool Quito, where he even joined the musical Conservatory, acquiring a taste for music and literature that would later turn him into a poet. He would graduate as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad Central de Ecuador' in 1883. He then joined the Partido Liberal and worked as a teacher in the Guayaquil University, and with his artistic skill and personal charm, he quickly climbed the ranks of the Partido Liberal. Alfredo's first political experience between 1903 and 1906 when he was chosen to be Vice-President, and was elected President of Ecuador in 1916. As President of Ecuador, he adopted the motto 'One more bridge is one less abyss', he abolished Native servitude and debt imprisonment, and spent lavishly on education, health and public works for the people, even hiring the famous Japanese doctor, Hideyo Noguchi, to help the government fight the Yellow Fever. Now that Moreno has become President for the second time in his life, he'll continue his gentle and generous approach to politics and advocate for reconciliation with neighbouring countries."
POLITICS_FREDERICO_PAEZ_CHIRBOGA_DESC:0 "Federico Páez Chiriboga was born in 1877 in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito. He studied in the Lycée Hoche in Versailles, and would later graduate from the universities of Ghent and Brussels as an Engineer. He'd return to Ecuador and join the Socialist Party of Ecuador, but would eventually leave after fighting with the leaders of the party towards the Partido Liberal. However, his left leaning views inside the PL gained him the nickname 'The fifth Bolshevik', and has managed to form a socialist faction within the PL. Now that he has managed to gain power, He shall enact social reforms to help the struggling working class. However, he's bound to distance himself from his old socialist comrades and is willing to even begin a crackdown of the Partido Socialista's activities, as he now believes that they threat Ecuador with the prospect of a Syndicalist revolution."
POLITICS_JOSE_IBARRA_DESC:0 "José María Velasco Ibarra was born in 1893 in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito. José graduated from the 'Universidad Central del Ecuador' as a lawyer in 1922 with a thesis on Syndicalism. He then became a teacher for that university and wrote several Essays regarding politics until 1930 where he joined the Partido Conservador Ecuatoriano, and steadily climbed through the ranks of the Argolla clique until he was designated President in the fraudulent elections of 1933. In his time as President, he managed to approve an economic plan by the Ecuadorian banker Victor Emilio Strada, which has slowly but steadily improved the economic situation of Ecuador. However, he has broken his promises regarding guaranteeing civil liberties and respecting popular will, and the economic prosperity of Ecuador might be the only thing keeping him in power, with popular unrest strengthening his Liberal rivals."
POLITICS_Alberto_GALLO_DESC:0 "Gil Alberto Enríquez Gallo was born in 1894 in his family's farm in the province of Cotopaxi, Ecuador. Gallo abandoned high-school definitively in 1911 and joined the army, where in 1913 he'd be tasked to take a course in the 'Escuela de Aplicación para Militares Inferiores' by his officer in charge, Luis Cabrera, graduating with the rank of Second Lieutenant and steadily rising through the ranks of the army since then. Still a liberal at heart, now that he's accomplished his patriotic duty and overthrown the Conservative Argolla Clique, he'll seek to restore stability and purge syndicalist elements in order to secure Ecuadorian society before restoring democracy."
POLITICS_CARLOS_CAJAS_DESC:0 "Carlos Mancheno Cajas was born in 1902 in Riobamba, Chimborazo province, Ecuador. He studied in the 'Escuela Superior Militar Eloy Alfaro', where he graduated as a second-lieutenant and kept climbing steadily through the ranks. He became Minister of Defence During Ibarra's Presidency, but has become deeply dissatisfied by the Partido Conservador, drifting him towards the Ecuador First Party. Now that he has become the Ecuadorian Head of State, he shall rule with an iron fist and try to restore order to a chaotic Ecuador."
POLITICS_RICARDO_PAREDES_DESC:0 "Ricardo Paredes Romero was born in 1898 in Riobamba, Chimborazo province, Ecuador. Ricardo graduated as a physician in 1920, and even managed to meet several Ecuadorian influential figures like Isidro Ayora during his time in College. He founded the Partido Socialista Ecuatoriano in 1926, and would represent it in Paris several times during the years following the Syndicalists revolution. Influenced by his French comrades, Ricardo has moved his party more towards Syndicalism than when it was first founded, even managing to acquire the nickname 'The Apostle of the Ecuadorian Syndicalism'. Now that he has managed to become President, he'll fight against local factionalism and defend better native's rights, with hopes of achieving a more equal and fairer Ecuador."
POLITICS_DOLORES_CACUANGO_DESC:0 "Dolores Cacuango Quilo, also known as Mamá Doloreyuki Cacuango, was born in 1881 in Cayambe, Pichicha province, Ecuador. She was born to a family of native Quechua Gañanes, so she was never able to get a formal education, for which she wouldn't even able to read or write properly throughout her life, and would only be able to learn Spanish when she moved to Quito. In 1927, inspired by Juan Albamocho, she'd join the Movimiento Maximista Ecuatoriano, and begin organizing the natives in order to acquire better rights. Dolores managed to stage a successful insurrection in 1931, but would be crushed quickly by Gallo's forces. In 1934 she decided to join forces with Ricardo Paredes, and have since then both tried to change Ecuadorian society. However, Dolores doesn't care about the Criollos in Ecuador, and now that she's in power, she'll improve the rights and livelihood of the native population with no regards for the Criollos's opinion."
POLITICS_NELA_MARTINEZ_DESC:0 "Nela Martínez Espinosa was born in 1912 in Cañar, Ecuador. She was fond of writing poetry since a very young age, and would join the 'Partido Socialista Ecuatoriano'. However, she began having differences with the pro-native stance of the party, as they began pushing for more radical reforms, whereas Martinez defended a more moderate approach. As such, she left the PSE and joined the 'Movimiento de Liberación Ecuatoriano', and has since then climbed steadily through the ranks with her charisma until becoming their leader. Now that Martinez is in power, she'll begin a slow transition to a syndicalist society, and a fairer Ecuador for everyone, while trying to compromise with the many internal factions within Ecuador."
POLITICS_CARLOS_TOLA_DESC:0 "Carlos Julio Arosemena Tola was born in 1888 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He studied law for many years in the Cornell University of New York, but he never managed to graduate. Despite this, his connections with the high class he was able to found the 'Banco de Descuento', of which he is still the manager, and with the money of said bank he has dedicated to open charity organisations to help the poor and unfortunate in Ecuador. He joined the Partido Conservador Ecuatoriano, where he was even named Vice-President of Ibarra despite his differences with the Argolla clique, which has gained him an honourable reputation within the populace. Surprisingly, despite Ayora's popularity, Tola has come out on top in the elections, and now that he sits in the 'Palacio de Carondelet' he'll try to continue the Conservative policies while trying to revert the damage the Argolla clique has caused to the democratic institutions in Ecuador."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_PONS_DESC:0 "Antonio Pons Campuzano was born in 1897 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He graduated as a physician in 1921, and would join the Ecuadorian Conservative Party during his years in the university. He led a rather unremarkable political career until he became President of the Cantonal Council of Guayaquil, where his popularity lead to President Velasco Ibarra to offer him the post of Governor of Guayaquil. He accepted his post, but would later on resign due to his opposing views regarding the Argolla Clique and Ibarra's ever more increasing hegemony. He has now managed to become President of Ecuador, and as such, he'll try to compromise with the Liberals to lead Ecuador to a better tomorrow and mend the rift the Argolla clique created in the country."
POLITICS_NEPTALI_BONIFAZ_DESC:0 "Neptalí Bonifaz Ascazubi was born in 1870 in the Ecuadorian capital, Quito. He travelled to Europe in 1885 to study Economic, Political and Commercial sciences in Geneva and Paris. He'd return to Ecuador in 1910, where he'd keep a low profile until he was called by President Ayora to become the president of the central bank of Ecuador. Despite his conservative leanings, he took the job and has since then joined the Conservative party gaining notoriety within it. Bonifaz is considered a paternalist conservative, who defends compulsory social security, the improvement of small businesses possibilities within Ecuador and monetary stability. Now that Neptalí is in power, he'll try to live up to these promises while keeping a friendly relationship with the Liberal Party."
POLITICS_CARLOS_ARROYO_DESC:0 "Carlos Alberto Arroyo del Río was born in 1893 in Guayaquil, Ecuador. He graduated as a lawyer in 1914 and in 1915 he had already become a PL substitute deputy for the Guayas province. He continued his political career as a teacher in law while he continued climbing the ranks of the Liberal party until becoming one of the most popular figures of the party, even eclipsing Ayora's popularity. A staunch defender of the liberal ideas the 'Partido Liberal Ecuatoriano' stands for, he'll seek to improve the Ecuadorian economy, reduce government intervention in the economy and continue mending the rift between the Liberals and Conservatives in the country in order to improve Ecuador's stability"

### Events ###
ecu.0.t: "Shadow of Its Former Self"
ecu.0.d: "The state once known as [ROOT.GetName] suffered some bumpy early years shortly after its independence in 1809. Border uncertainties led to conflicts with Peru and Colombia while rival oligarchies between large landowning conservatives in the highlands and the liberal populace on the coast fought each other bitterly.\n\nIn the midst of all this a disaster struck: [ROOT.GetName]'s neighbors, Colombia and Peru, began fighting a border war over the control of the Amazonian city of Leticia and it's immediate surroundings. The small conflict quickly became full-scale war, but the aggressor, Peru, wasn't able to make any gains and quickly turned its attention toward Ecuador.\nPlanning to march into Colombia via Quito, they sent an unexpected ultimatum to then president Alberto Guerrero Martinez, who quickly asked for international support to defend his country. However the rest of the world turned a blind eye to the matter and without any other option he pledged his allegiance to Colombia.\nWhat followed was a complete embarrassment for the Ecuadorean people as the unprepared army struggled and soon failed to stop the invading Peruvian army.\n\nOnce the conflict ended, Ecuador lost its independence and was reduced to a puppet government by their former rival, losing all of its eastern territories and getting it's name changed to Quitaquil, while Colombia lost much of its southern land and fell into chaos. After a one year period of occupation, with things returning to apparent normality, Peru decided to allow an allied civil government to rule within the limit of regular administration. Thus ex-president Neptalí Bonifaz Ascázubi, who had seen his presidency previously invalidated because of his Peruvian nationality, was brought back to lead the country.\nDespite what the Peruvians think, the situation in Quitaquil is all but calm. No matter the decision by its overlord to make fringe groups such as socialists and national populists illegal, these extremists are incessantly working in the underground and attracting the public with their rebirth narrative.\nNonetheless, no one really knows what's in Quitaquil's future, neither Peru nor Quitaquil itself."
ecu.0.a: "Let's find that out!"

ecu.1.t: "First Semester Review Boosts Confidence"
ecu.1.d: "As it's the norm, Peru has prepared it's annual review to assess the situation inside our nation and our relationship with them. What came out paints a somewhat positive picture for our future togheter.\nEconomic and stability goals have been and the trust in our overlord from our citizens is slowly growing, as more and more people are feeling more secure with them that what they have ever felt otherwise.\n\nAs such Peru asks us, in the last paragraph of the document, to keep the people happy and the economy strong and free as we are currently doing and assure their effort lesser and lesser deployment of troops in our country.\nMany analysts suggests that by the end of the year or the start of the next Peru could concede us a greater deal of independence."
ecu.1.a: "That's some great news!"

ecu.2.t: "The March Crisis"
ecu.2.d: "The economists have been doing quite the effort to pretend otherwise, but Black Monday has ruined [ROOT.GetName] in a very thorough manner. Indeed, exports of cocoa from [ROOT.GetName] dropped dramatically following the crash, our biggest heavy industries almost stopped to and halt and unlike during the previous crash in 1925 when the conservatives held up on power, the political pressure has mounted, and riots broke out in Quito, Guayaquil and in many other cities, inspired by populist movements."
ecu.2.a: "Dios Mios!"

ecu.30.t: "The Movimiento Alfarista Insurgente"
ecu.30.d: "As the turmoil deepens, dissenting voices critical of our government are gaining momentum. One of them is the Movimiento Alfarista Insurgente, a populist group with totalist leanings. They operate through secret societies led by an unknown directorate. Playing on opposing itself to both the democratic establishment and our pragmatic third position, the insurgent group's mission supposedly revolves around restoring a historical revisionist socialist vision inspired by Eloy Alfaro, with the primary goal of liberating the people from Peruvian oversight.\nAccording to speculation the movement will seek to establish a centralized socialist nation and promises that after a period of benevolent transitional dictatorship, by whom is still not known, democracy will be restored.\n\nInformation are still very scarce on the group and his leaders. We need to keep a close eye on them in case they get more traction with the public."
ecu.30.a: "We'll look into it."

ecu.31.t: "Rebels Organize in Guayaquil"
ecu.31.d: "In recent days, tensions have escalated in Guayaquil and its outskirts following recession, leaving a sour taste in the mouths of many. Those opposed to the Peruvian authorities fear that this review is merely a guise for further eroding the independence of the once proud Republic of Ecuador, potentially relegating it to a mere province within Peruvian borders. Reports indicate that these dissenters are organizing in 'secret societies' and thus they have been linked with the undergound Movimiento Alfarist Insurgente, though an official link has yet to be confirmed. The army and national police are preparing countermeasures with the support of Peruvian forces."
ecu.31.a: "What an unruly populace!"

ecu.16.t: "Second Semester Review Brings Bad News"
ecu.16.d: "As it's the norm, Peru has prepared it's annual review to assess the situation inside our nation and our relationship with them. What came out paints a bad picture for our future togheter.\nPeru expresses significant dissatisfaction with our economic and stability developments. Additionally, our brothers in Lima are highly concerned about our handling of reactionary elements attempting to destabilize the government, as highlighted in the report.\n\nAs soon as the report came into our office a sentiment of dread spread around. The more pessimistic among us interpret this as an implicit warning of potential challenges ahead, including the possibility of a full-scale military occupation by Peru since this is the second year in a row that the review turns out negative. We should not underestimate the fact that these documents clearly indicate deep dissatisfaction from our counterparts in Lima, and we must consider the implications of their discontent.\n\nAnother additional question lingers: what are we to do with these documents?"
ecu.16.a: "Destroy these documents and cover up the entire situation."
ecu.16.b: "We must de-escalate: consult our military advisor."

ecu.3.t: "Peru gets ready to occupy us"
ecu.3.d: "Diplomats from our overlord are notifying us of Peru's preparations for a potential military occupation of our nation, with the intention of installing a temporary junta aligned with their national interests. They emphasize Peru's profound dissatisfaction with our achievements from the past year and our overall governance.\nDue to these concerns, among others, they urge us to peacefully step down and facilitate a smooth transition, stressing the preservation of our existing borders. They reassure us that this is a temporary measure and promise a return of power once stability is restored.\n\nWhile many have lost hope, a small faction within our cabinet remains resolute in their belief that we can address this situation. Since receiving the annual review, they have diligently drafted a plan for changes that Lima may find favorable and meaningful. These changes aim to demonstrate our commitment and determination to lead Quitaquil towards the path of greatness, in partnership with our ally Peru.\nWhat shall we do?"
ecu.3.a: "We must do what's best for Quitaquil, step down."
ecu.3.b: "José, send them those documents, ahora mismo!"

ecu.33.t: "A Peruvian Junta Overthrows the Presidency"
ecu.33.d: "Today, Peruvian military leaders have finally taken control of the ineffective and rebellious [ECU.GetAdjective] presidential office. Former President Neptalí Bonifaz Ascázubi has been removed, and he is now under our military's care. With a swift and brilliant operation, the military advanced, not from the borders as most [ECU.GetAdjective] expected, but from within the country itself. Troops from the army base near the capital were secretly mobilized to strategic points and captured them without hesitation. This success was made possible by the excellent cooperation of Peruvian officers stationed in Quito and soldiers who had long been prepared with secret instructions for such a situation.\n\nNow the junta is getting ready to nominate a peruvian acting dictator to replace the disgraced half-blooded one."
ecu.33.a: "Quito is ours."

ecu.34.t: "Peruvian Occupation Averted"
ecu.34.d: "Thanks to the swift action of our last-minute letter, we have successfully averted the looming threat of a complete occupation by our master generals. It appears that the contents of the letter have persuaded the Peruvian government to grant us a reprieve. However, this is not the time for complacency. We must remain vigilant and take decisive action to ensure the passage of the proposed reforms. Failure to do so leaves us vulnerable to potential strikes from the formidable Peruvian military in the future."

Citizens gathered to greet our new president, General Enrique Gallo, who addressed the nation via radio with the good news.\n\nThe general stated: 'Neptalí's corrupt government attempted to conceal from the public that Peru was planning an intervention, aiming to seize our lands because their puppet hadn't sufficiently oppressed our people! The cabinet simply capitulated. What else could we expect from a half-blooded Peruvian and his cronies?\nOnce our men learned the truth, we recalled our oaths from the days of Bolívar and Eloy Alfaro: no masters, no oppressors. We acted swiftly and took the palace.\nQuitaquil is no more, and the people are once again free from their oppressors! Ecuador rises from the ashes of its glorious past and lights the path forward.'"

Eyewitnesses report that he escaped using a private plane belonging to a close friend, fleeing to Pasto under a false name. Another report suggests he crossed into Chile with assistance from their government. The point is, he is now a fugitive.\nOur plans to permanently remove him must be postponed for now."

ecu.18.d: "It's 5PM in Quito in this late saturday afternoon, in a well-known bar named 'El Zorro' close to the presidential palace meets the top of the crop of [ROOT.GetAdjective] society. There liberal politicians meet with wealthy cacao farmers of the coast and the most trendy bankers of Guayaquil. All of this elite, that met for the first time under Eloy Alfaro's regime at the turn of the century reunited for power under our legitimate president and it is now with them that [ROOT.GetName] is managed. And it's in this bar that the most important decisions of the country are actually negotiated or even decided. After all the interest of the bankers is to have clients and the interest of the farmers is to have money for their enterprise, in a country where export cultures make up most of the wealth, it is only natural for this duo to be in power..."
ecu.18.a: "The liberal world is back on track."

ecu.19.t: "The Rebirth of Guayaquil"
ecu.19.d: "Guayaquil, with its port and its banks, was the capital of the liberal world at the start of the 20th century. Even after that period, it stayed a close competer of the supremacy of Quito. The institution of the new elite gave wings to the city that is now booming with life again, while the important banks were broken up and controlled by the conservatives they are now regrouping to be as strong as ever and dominate the life in Guayaquil. At the port, exports were severely hit by the impact of Black Monday but cacao and bananas are now flowing again. The city became the point of attention of the whole country and many are the destitute farmers fleeing their land to find a job in the dream of the agitated nights of Guayaquil."
ecu.19.a: "Guayaquil, you are a lady!"

ecu.20.t: "The Banks' Actions Endanger Farmers"
ecu.20.d: "We should have known empowering bankers doesn't only come with advantages, and past examples in history have proven its danger. But nevertheless we didn't listen and gave too much leeway to the bankers in Guayaquil. With their newfound power they began funding and speculating on agriculture like never before, sadly not always to the advantage of the farmers. After a complex financial manipulation involving several relationships between farmers and loaners, a sudden destabilisation of the cultures in a region west of Guayaquil led to the bankruptcy of several cacao farmers, and much profit for the bankers. This unfortunate event turned into a national scandal when these influential farmers started agitating their colleagues against the government's favor toward the moneymen. Now, spread by newspapers and talked about on the street, we can't ignore this issue anymore and have to bring an answer to it. What will it be?"
ecu.20.a: "Punish the banks and relieve the farmers."
ecu.20.b: "Do nothing; after all this is the free market."

ecu.22.t: "A Reactionary Spy!"
ecu.22.d: "Our secret services surprised in the streets of Quito a man with a quite strange behaviour. He was observed walking nervously, frequently scanning his surroundings, and reportedly wearing symbols associated with a populist movement. This last detail prompted our agents to conduct a thorough investigation, revealing that he was not an ordinary citizen but rather a reactionary spy collaborating with foreign powers to orchestrate a future coup! This dangerous threat was swiftly neutralized when the spy was arrested during a clandestine meeting with corrupt soldiers in a dimly lit bar in Quito. With the spy now in custody and public outrage mounting, we must decide his fate. Should we subject him to a popular trial in the streets, or should we organize a formal trial to set an example?"
ecu.22.a: "Leave him to a popular 'trial'!"
ecu.22.b: "Make an official example of him!"

ecu.23.t: "The Grandiose Trial of the Spy"
ecu.23.d: "The spy arrived at the grand court of Quito promptly at 8 a.m. to begin his trial, accompanied by the attorney appointed by the interior ministry. Across from him sat the judge and, most importantly, the prosecutor. The room was packed with hundreds of onlookers eager to witness the fate of the traitor, as the numerous crimes uncovered by our secret services were detailed. Following a brief opportunity for his defense, the prosecutor delivered a compelling speech, swiftly followed by the judge's decisive ruling: the spy was found guilty and sentenced to execution by decapitation at the earliest opportunity, for the greater good of the nation. This act of justice will serve as a strong deterrent against future dissidents and reactionaries."
ecu.23.a: "And the head falls."

ecu.24.t: "Purifying the Press"
ecu.24.d: "As part of the process of strengthening the rule of the military in the country, one target will have to be the multiple newspapers [ROOT.GetName] has. Coming from different sides of the political spectrum and influenced by big parties, the information and analysis conveyed in them don't always appeal to Gallo and might endanger the stability of the new state. As such a reorganisation of the press to bring it more in line with patriotic ideals will be started and we will make sure no one will spread dangerous reports in authorized newspapers anymore."
ecu.24.a: "Only the real patriots will stay."

ecu.25.t: "Dissent Amongst the Officers"
ecu.25.d: "As no revolts happened consequentially to the Gallo coup, it might be believed that all of the army got behind the new government but that would be a foolish assumption. Indeed, separate from Gallo's clique and more authoritarian leaning generals, there is an important fraction of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] military that follows progressive ideals and grows more and more opposed to the dictatorship of General Gallo. These officers and soldiers claim the army is here not to opress but to defend the people against enemies on the outside and the inside and that protecting democracy is also a part of that mission. This fraction is quickly becoming dangerous for the stability of the government that could be teared apart easily by intense infighting. To prevent this break up, the solution would be to make this fraction totally disappear in one way or another. A quick elimination will solve the problem immediately but will shock not only the people but also more military men and it might be wise to make this elimination more progressive. What will we do?"
ecu.25.a: "Purge the disloyals right now!"
ecu.25.b: "We will take more gradual steps..."

ecu.26.t: "Rallying the Army"
ecu.26.d: "The army has been a backbone of the construction and stabilisation of [ROOT.GetAdjective] democracy and as such also holds important leverage over its survival or not. To protect democracy, the army must be completely integrated into it and given positions of prestige amongst the [ROOT.GetAdjective] elites. At the same time, we'll teach the youth to love its army and will promote the military with programs throughout the whole nation. The army must become the most loyal defender of democracy if we want it to last."
ecu.26.a: "The army is the protector of democracy."

ecu.38.t: "The Misadventure of an Explorer"
ecu.38.d: "An unfortunate story reached the presidential palace today, it seems an American explorer who got a permit to explore and cast a movie about volcanoes in the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Andes suffered from a painful death. Accompanied by a local guide, the explorer was climbing up one of the most impressive volcanoes in the region when he decided to take better shots of the lava by filming it directly. Despite the warnings of the guide, the explorer proceeded to lean on the side of the volcano, further and further, until he fell heads down in the pit while his guide watched in horror. The [ROOT.GetAdjective] government announced the news to the American ambassador and expressed its deepest condolences for this accident."
ecu.38.a: "This yank is on fire..."

ecu.44.t: "A New Flag Proposal" #regular version
ecu.44.d: "The introduction of a new constitution has not only brought celebration and increased stability across the country but has also provided our Alfarist Government with a means to establish its legitimacy. This design features our nation's founding figure Eloy Alfaro alongside Field Marshal Gallo, proudly holding the constitution for the world to see.\n\nInterestingly, an art critic from the capital had the chance to view this proposed flag when the minister extended an invitation. The critic's response was rather blunt: 'Total rubbish. Most probably the worst thing I have ever seen put on paper, ever.'\n\nDespite a few critics, the prevailing sentiment appears to favor a change. Should we proceed with this redesign?"
ecu.44.a: "Ecuador will kneel in front of my picture, proceed."
ecu.44.b: "I think the current one is good enough."

ecu.45.t: "A New Flag Proposal" #meme version
ecu.45.d: "The introduction of a new constitution has not only brought celebration and increased stability across the country but has also provided our Alfarist Government with a means to establish its legitimacy. This design features our nation's founding figure Eloy Alfaro alongside popular singer Kanye Oeste, proudly holding the constitution for the world to see.\n\nInterestingly, an art critic from the capital had the chance to view this proposed flag when the minister extended an invitation. The critic's response was rather inspiring: 'Brilliant. Most probably the best thing I have ever seen put on paper, ever.'\n\nShould we proceed with this redesign?"
ecu.45.a: "Ecuador will kneel in front of Oeste's picture, proceed."
ecu.45.b: "I think the current one is good enough."


##Generals and Admirals##

ECU_Enriquez_Gallo_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 24, 1894, in Latacunga, Cotopaxi province, Ecuador\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enriquez first saw himself in the military in 1900, when he met Eloy Alfaro after a battle against President Lizardo García's forces. Gallo's encounter with Alfaro instilled a selfless patriotism in him, leading him to volunteer in 1910 to fight against Perú. He was accepted as a drummer in the Pichicha battalion and reached the rank of Corporal before the war ended. He finally decided to abandon his studies in 1911, where he joined the Montero Revolutionary army. His first combat experience was holding a bridge against Flavio Alfaro's forces with tree soldiers, where they managed to hold out for a whole day successfully despite heavy fighting. In 1912 he was tasked by his CEO to apply for the 'Escuela de Aplicación para Militares Inferiores', graduating as a second lieutenant. From there he kept climbing through the ranks until becoming Captain in 1918. In 1922, he was sent to Guayaquil, where he ordered a bayonet charge against a group of strikers that were disturbing the peace in the city. Gallo saw them as a threat to Ecuador, ordering the execution of many strikers, who where then thrown in the Guayas River to dispose of the evidence. During the years of the liberal elite clique, despite his ideological differences with the government, Gallo has followed orders and has strived to keep stability in Ecuador, allowing him to gain the rank of Field Marshall.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Despite having liberal views, Gallo worries more about Ecuador as a whole than about the Liberal/Conservative divide, and will do his duty no matter who's in charge."
ECU_Edmundo_Chiribonga_Gonzalez_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1917, in Riobamba, Ecuador.\n§YMilitary Career:§W César Edmundo Chiriboga González has recently joined the 'Escuela Superior Militar Eloy Alfaro' and is still learning the ropes of military strategy. However, his displays of talent at a tactical level have quickly made him rise through the ranks despite his inexperience."
ECU_Hugo_Ortiz_Garces_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 5, 1920, in Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Hugo Ortiz Garcés joined the 'Escuela Superior Militar Eloy Alfaro' in 1935, and has shown promise by achieving outstanding grades in military strategy and history. However, he lacks practical experience that is only barely covered by his personal talent."
ECU_Luis_Larrea_Alba_desc: "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W October 25, 1894, in Guayaquil, Ecuador.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Luis Alberto Larrea Alba joined the National Army in 1911, where he has slowly but steadily climbed through the ranks until becoming a General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Affiliated to the Socialist wing of the Partido Liberal."

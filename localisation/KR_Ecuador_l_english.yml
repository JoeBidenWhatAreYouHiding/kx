# Gallo #
ECU_gallo:0 "Gallo Steps In"
ECU_gallo_desc:0 "General Gallo has stepped in to ensure our nation's economy recovers, that the Republic won't succomb to chaos and syndicalism and to keep our borders safe. Long live general Gallo!"
ECU_stateofexecao:0 "State of Exception"
ECU_stateofexecao_desc:0 "Extraordinary problems demand extraordinary solutions. Our nation is on the brink of falling to anarchy or worse: to syndicalism, and only a firm hand will keep our families and faith safe. We have to declare a state of exception that will allow Gallo to suspend the constitution and ignore most limiting laws for the good of the country."
ECU_chilean_spies:0 "Deal with Syndicalist Spies"
ECU_chilean_spies_desc:0 "It is common knowledge that the bulk of syndicalist agitators in the country, be that in the PSE, in the factories or amongst the poor peasants, are spies sent by syndicalist states to destabilize Ecuador. We must hunt those fake 'militants' and make sure they won't cause any trouble ever again."
ECU_loyalty:0 "Deal with Fifth Columnists"
ECU_loyalty_desc:0 "Many of our army officers still cling to the idea that our government is illegitimate and reactionary. We must not let those traitors continue like that!"
ECU_gommiegone:0 "Ban the PSE"
ECU_gommiegone_desc:0 "If there is a pit of foreign agitation in Ecuador it's the Partido Socialista Ecuatoriano, under the pretence of the party working fairly in the democratic environment lies the constant threat of syndicalism that can corrupt the whole country. We have to put an end to this travesty."
ECU_bossgallo:0 "The Army Reigns"
ECU_bossgallo_desc:0 "After taking over the government, the army must invest all levels of power in society. The army is the best fit to rule the administration, the economy, the government and everything that matters in the country."
ECU_purifying_country:0 "Purifying Ecuador"
ECU_purifying_country_desc:0 "The goal of Gallo is not only to protect Ecuador from all threats but also to purify its morale and its democracy by working towards removing any trace of corruption, dissidence, greed and treachery in the Ecuadorian society. Ecuador must be a moral and just nation."
ECU_populist_measures:0 "Populist Measures"
ECU_populist_measures_desc:0 "It is unacceptable that Ecuadorian citizens that are supposed to be protected by their state can be left alone to die in the streets. It is our Christian and patriotic duty to help them get out of their misery so that they can live a decent life in their own country."
ECU_uphold_traditions:0 "Protect the Ecuadorian Morale"

ECU_new_constitution_desc:0 "Now that Ecuador is cleaned of its destabilising elements and that its society has been purified, it might be ready to finally get a new constitution and end the junta in favour of a new democracy. We shall start working on writing such a constitution with Gallo and his closest advisers."
ECU_restore_democracy_tt:0 "§GExcept for a last minute decision, democracy will be restored in 1941 by the military and new democratic elections will take place.§!\n"

ECU_intellectual_amnesty:0 "Intellectual Amnesty"

# Liberals #
ECU_isidro:0 "Liberal Takeover"
ECU_isidro_desc:0 "The elections have shown the will of the people, the Partido Liberal Radical will now rule Ecuador to a brighter future!"
ECU_isidro2:0 "Isidro Takes the Reins of Government"
ECU_isidro2_desc:0 "Isidro Ayora is a well known individual in Ecuador, with quite a reputation as a surgeon and patron of medical institutions in Ecuador. Now that he has been elected, he has decided to take matters into his own hands, as he knows what is best for our nation, and how to deal with the crisis we are in!"
ECU_isidro3:0 "Liberal Hegemony"
ECU_isidro3_desc:0 "The PLRE has probably gained enough political capital for decades! With the back of the conservatives crushed, the long struggle between us has finally come to an end"
ECU_poltechsloty:0 "Our Own Scientists"
ECU_poltechsloty_desc:0 "Even if the famous scientists that are the closest to the conservative elites are now resistant and unwilling to work on important projects we can draw from our own pool of friends amongst the scientific community."
ECU_legalfacade:0 "Legal Facade"
ECU_legalfacade_desc:0 "Some of the laws we need to get the nation back on track are technically unconstitutional or break the rules of democracy, but worry not for other laws can be voted to make it legal. After all we have the majority in the parliament and that's all that matters."
ECU_justice:0 "Modernise Penal Code"
ECU_justice_desc:0 "The penal code that has been in place in Ecuador is shameful to read, considering how unfair it is and how much it serves conservative interests. Our project should be to write a fair and modern penal code for a modern nation."
ECU_laicity:0 "Uphold Secularity"
ECU_laicity_desc:0 "The PLRE historically opposed the domination of the church in Ecuador by promoting secularity to a national level. This work started under Alfaro's rule has to continue and for starters the abuses of the conservatives in this matter have to stop. Of course, removing these conservative puppets from power will also prove itself to be useful for our political domination."
ECU_bankers:0 "Banking Interests"
ECU_bankers_desc:0 "The liberal elites have numerous links to the banking world, especially in Guayaquil. These close ties can lead to a national collaboration that can only be beneficial for the country."
ECU_guayaquil:0 "Guayaquil Rebirthed"
ECU_guayaquil_desc:0 "Under the rule of liberals and their investments in the capital of commerce and banking the coastal city of Guayaquil is yet again thriving after a certain stop during the conservatives' rule and is quickly becoming the economic capital of Ecuador."
ECU_liberal_boom:0 "Economic Boom"
ECU_liberal_boom_desc:0 "The attention the liberals give to the health of the economy and the several partnerships they have with economic actors throughout the country assured the recovery of Ecuador and its plantations. The economy is booming and unemployment is rapidly decreasing to be a matter of the past."
ECU_liberty_not_implore_knees:0 "Liberty Can't Be Plead on Your Knees"
ECU_liberty_not_implore_knees_desc:0 "Liberty can't be plead on your knees, once said the Liberal patriarch Eloy Alfaro. These words represent the liberal spirit, we want freedom and we'll fight for it at any time and at any place for the better of the people of Ecuador and for the glory of its democracy. This is what good the liberal republic can bring!"

# Democracy #
ECU_balance_powers:0 "Balance of Powers"
ECU_balance_powers_desc:0 "With the surprise victory of the Conservatives in the last elections a sort of balance of powers between the two main parties was put into place during the confusion. While the established liberals have been temporarily shaken they got back on their feet to influence the republic heavily, in which the conservatives hold the actual power, leading to a situation that might finally see real political fights arise."
ECU_democracy_restored:0 "Democracy Re-established"
ECU_democracy_restored_desc:0 "Gallo and his military clique finally resigned from power and left their own constitution as a model for the new republic. Their heavy work and active policies completely restructured Ecuadorian politics, we hope that is for the best."
ECU_power_parliament:0 "Power to the Parliament"
ECU_power_parliament_desc:0 "No longer shall a man take absolute power in the Republic and name himself dictator yet again, the centre of power in the new republic will not be the president any more, but the parliament and its internal fights within parties. That's real democracy!"
ECU_bipartisan_organisation:0 "Bipartisan Structures"
ECU_bipartisan_organisation_desc:0 "The destruction or failure of political alternatives in the last years left the country with only two sensible political options: the PCE and the PLRE. With their usual grip on politics greatly diminished, those two parties now have to work together to shape the republic to their liking while sharing all its important positions."
ECU_marginalisation:0 "Marginalisation of Radicals"
ECU_marginalisation_desc:0 "They were hit before but they still exist: political radicals, coming from the left or the right threatens the stability of our democracy and the bipartisan status quo. They shall be fought against and marginalised from the running of democracy."
ECU_building_meritocracy:0 "Building a Meritocracy"
ECU_building_meritocracy_desc:0 "The goal of this new republic is not to favour the clientelism and corruption that was rampant in the old times. No, what it shall try to build is a meritocracy ensuring only the best men of our country will get to serve it and lead it to glory. Even if the selection process might be biased, it will still be better than nepotism."
ECU_rally_army:0 "Rally the Army to Democracy"
ECU_rally_army_desc:0 "The Republic couldn't exist without the army and it couldn't last without it. We have to make sure the army is on our side if we want democracy to last."
ECU_technocrat_rule:0 "Technocrat Rule"
ECU_technocrat_rule_desc:0 "It seems the weakening of the executive power and the disorganisation of the parliament is leaving a hole in the direction of the country. During those squabbles, the ones that ensure the country runs fine and improves are the new administrators recruited from the whole country. All together the form the technocratic elite of the Republic."
ECU_cities_cooperation:0 "Interurban Cooperation"
ECU_cities_cooperation_desc:0 "Instead of constantly having a fight for the most dominating city between Quito and Guayaquil we could put those fights aside and have the cities work together for the prosperity of Ecuador. After all they both have their advantages and their faults and with the rabid antagonism between the conservatives and the liberals now reduced, it could be time to launch common programs."
ECU_centralisation:0 "Increase Centralisation of Power"
ECU_centralisation_desc:0 "Now that internal competition is solved with, we have no reason to maintain several centres of power in the country. The state will run better if all of the powers are concentrated in one place for clear and straight policies to be enacted nationally."
ECU_rationalised_banking:0 "Rationalised Banking System"
ECU_rationalised_banking_desc:0 "The bankers, being before heavily politicised with the liberals can now more easily cooperate with technocrats or leaders of other parties. There is no way this won't lead to an economic improvement."
ECU_democracy_at_last:0 "A True Democracy"
ECU_democracy_at_last_desc:0 "With all of its problems dealt with the Republic is now ready to face the test of time and continue to work towards the improvement of the Ecuadorian nation. Viva la Republica!"

## Military ##
ECU_army:0 "Military Modernisation"
ECU_army_desc:0 "While our military is ready to beat up a few protestors, it will be inadequate if Peru ever decides to take over our rightful territory they claim as theirs. We need to modernize our armed forces to protect Ecuador from foreign threats."

# Army #
ECU_army2:0 "Maintenance Effort"
ECU_army2_desc:0 "Our army is inadequately maintained. We need to increase the military budget and we need to invest more into military production capacities. The future of the Pastaza is at stake!"
ECU_plan_against_peru:0 "Plan Against Our Neighbours"
ECU_plan_against_peru_desc:0 "Our neighbours from all sides are threats to our independence. They all have territorial claims on our small nation and if they ever attack, they won't get much farther than the border!"
ECU_bunker_loja:0 "§YLoja:§! Gives 2 levels of land fort in two provinces\n"
ECU_jungle_reco:0 "Jungle Reconnaissance"
ECU_jungle_reco_desc:0 "The Pastaza is primarily made up of jungles and dense forests. We need to adapt our reconnaissance units to this harsh environment if we wish to effectively repel Peruvian offensives."
ECU_control_jungles:0 "Control of the Jungles"
ECU_control_jungles_desc:0 "If we control the jungle, Peru won't even be able to enter them. The jungle is an extremely harsh environment, so whoever is the most adapted to it has a large advantage on the battlefield."
ECU_trenchperimeters:0 "Weltkrieg Artillery Tactics"
ECU_trenchperimeters_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg has revolutionized military tactics, and artillery tactics have changed the largest. We should adapt our artillery units to these new tactics, else we will lose the advantage on longer ranges."
ECU_offense:0 "Offensive Planning"
ECU_offense_desc:0 "It would be foolish to only defend. Never has a nation won by simply defending, the Napoleonic Wars and the Weltkrieg have proven that well enough. We need to plan for offensive capabilities."
ECU_reorganise_defense_forces:0 "Reorganise our Border Forces"
ECU_reorganise_defense_forces_desc:0 "Our border with Peru is inadequately defended, and our border with Colombia shouldn't even be talked about. We need to reorganize and expand the border patrols and garrisons."
ECU_give_equipment:0 "Gives §Y500§! 1936 Infantry Equipment pieces\n"
ECU_commando:0 "Special Forces Experiments"
ECU_commando_desc:0 "The central regions of Ecuador, part of the Andes, are made up of extremely difficult, mountainous terrain that no ordinary soldier can fight in. We need to experiment with specialized units who can fight in difficult terrain."
ECU_motorization:0 "Early Motorisation"
ECU_motorization_desc:0 "Our roads might be underdeveloped and our terrain might be difficult, but that shouldn't stop us from partially motorizing our supply system. Besides, motorized vehicles allow for much more than just the transportation of soup."
ECU_salvage_trucks:0 "Salvage American Trucks"
ECU_salvage_trucks_desc:0 "The Americans have left Ecuador when their foreign influence dropped too low, but they haven't taken everything with them. We should salvage some of their abandoned trucks and use them for our own usage."
ECU_give_trucks:0 "Gives §Y500§! American Motorised pieces\n"
ECU_tothelastman:0 "Quito Perimeter"
ECU_tothelastman_desc:0 "Our beautiful capital city is in a very defensible location, up in the Andes. However, that doesn't mean that it is invulnerable. We need to further fortify Quito and have it serve as a stronghold in case of a successful foreign invasion."

# Navy #
ECU_navy:0 "Armada de Ecuador"
ECU_navy_desc:0 "Our navy is quite large in comparison to our size. However, it is still smaller than some of our rivals' navies, most importantly than that of Peru. We need to further expand our naval forces in order to defend our shores."
ECU_guayaquil_base:0 "Expand the Guayaquil Naval Base"
ECU_guayaquil_base_desc:0 "Guayaquil is the most important naval base in Ecuador. Most of our exports leave its docks and it is the home base our naval forces. We need to further invest in it to increase its capacity for trade and ships."
ECU_protect_base:0 "Protect the Guayaquil Base"
ECU_protect_base_desc:0 "Guayaquil is vital to us, and the enemy knows that. If we lose its port, our naval forces and our economy will be in quite a bad shape. We need to protect its docks at all costs."
ECU_yards:0 "Create Ecuadorian Dockyards"
ECU_yards_desc:0 "Our merchant and combat ships are both constructed on foreign soil, however, we can't depend on the world to build our ships forever. We need to construct proper Ecuadorian dockyards."
ECU_research_progress:0 "Naval Research Progress"
ECU_research_progress_desc:0 "In the new naval arms race that is emerging in the world, we can't fall behind. We need to invest more into the development and construction of new modern ships."
ECU_capital_ships:0 "Develop Capital Ships"
ECU_capital_ships_desc:0 "Every prestigious navy has a large flag ship. Our navy, despite its size, should also get a proper flag ship of its own! We need to develop capital ships powerful enough to rival the Peruvians."
ECU_galapagos_base:0 "A Galapagos Base"
ECU_galapagos_base_desc:0 "The Galapagos Islands are perfectly suited for a naval base in the Pacific. Due to its isolated location, it will be perfect for Ecuadorian ships as a base to intercept enemy trade and supply going through the Panama Canal and to assert our control over our seas further than Guayaquil."
ECU_control_our_seas:0 "Control Our Seas"
ECU_control_our_seas_desc:0 "The sea around Ecuador and all the way to the Galapagos shall forever be controlled by Ecuador: it is in our vital interest... as long as no larger navy actually tries to contest it."

ECU_develop_school_aviation:0 "Develop the School of Aviation"
ECU_develop_school_aviation_desc:0 "A school of aviation was built in Ecuador no earlier than in 1935 following several developments in the Ecuadorian aviation after the Weltkrieg. It is in our interest to make the best use of this school we can to exploit this entirely new and powerful military wing."
ECU_actual_bases:0 "Modern Air Bases"
ECU_actual_bases_desc:0 "An aircraft can't take off effectively from the improvised airfields we've built over the years. Modern aircraft require specialized runways to take-off and land successfully and hangars to protect the planes from the weather. The local airfield in Quito could become a modern air base with enough investment, and that's what we shall focus on."
ECU_first_fighters:0 "The First Fighter Battalion"
ECU_first_fighters_desc:0 "We have finally equipped our air force so far composed mostly of reconnaissance and training planes with its first fighter aircraft. These beautiful single-engine planes will fly our nation to new heights."
ECU_selvas_volcanes_mares:0 "Sobre Selvas, Volcanes y Mares"
ECU_selvas_volcanes_mares_desc:0 "The new motto of our air force is "Sobre Selvas, Volcanes y Mares", over jungles, volcanoes and seas, to protect all of Ecuador from foreign threats. The motto of our rival will be 'crashing in the jungle' once they meet our pilots."
ECU_gift_for_enemies:0 "Gifts for our Enemies"
ECU_gift_for_enemies_desc:0 "Modern warfare has proven the need for bombers that can deliver sizeable damage to enemy production lines and infrastructure with their precious explosive payload. As it stands, Ecuador doesn't possess any aircraft with those characteristics, and we should focus on investing in newer models if we wish to stand a chance against our aggressors."

## Economic ##
ECU_cacao_farmers:0 "Relieve Cacao Farmers"
ECU_cacao_farmers_desc:0 "Cacao is one of the most important products of our agriculture, and a large amount of our rural population grows it. With the deteriorating state of our economy, their plantations have become unprofitable and many are threatened by financial ruin. We need to aid them back onto their feet."
ECU_expand_transandino:0 "Expand the Transandino Railway"
ECU_expand_transandino_desc:0 "The Trans-Andean railway is a vital economic axis connecting our main port Guayaquil with the capital Quito. Due to harsh terrain, weather conditions and limited investments since its construction, it's in quite a bad shape. We need to rebuild and expand it to other cities of the Andes for the good of Ecuador!"
ECU_improve_port_infrastructure:0 "Improve Port Infrastructure"
ECU_improve_port_infrastructure_desc:0 "Our ports are another vital economic axis. Especially Guayaquil, which is vital for both the civilian economy and the navy, has a limited port capacity, which severely limits the economy. We need to expand the port's infrastructure."
ECU_manufacturing_expansion:0 "Manufacturing Expansion"
ECU_manufacturing_expansion_desc:0 "Our main exports might be primary resources, but that shouldn't stop us from building up a manufacturing industry. Manufactured goods are in demand as never before, so it will be highly profitable and the investments will pay for themselves quickly."
ECU_ecuatorianrubberboom:0 "Encourage Rubber Production"
ECU_ecuatorianrubberboom_desc:0 "The world is coming ever closer to a second Weltkrieg, and unlike in the first one, rubber is now an essential resource required for aircraft and motorized vehicles. We will make huge profits if we increase our rubber production and exportation."
ECU_diversify_agriculture:0 "Diversify Export Agriculture"
ECU_diversify_agriculture_desc:0 "If we only produce cacao, what would happen if the price of Cacao fell quickly in a matter of weeks? In order to avoid a collapse of our agricultural sector, we need to have a diverse offer to avoid too much damage caused by price fluctuations. Why not try bananas?"
ECU_local_consumption:0 "Promote Local Consumption"
ECU_local_consumption_desc:0 "Transportation and importation cost a good amount of money, instead we should promote local consumption. Instead of importing food from Argentina, why not eat Ecuadorian food? Furthermore this national market can help us sell our stocks in times of crisis when exports fall, better sell a product at a low price than not sell it at all."

ECU_neweconomicplan:0 "State Plans"
ECU_neweconomicplan_desc:0 "Our latest economic policies have helped the economy to come back on its feet, and now it can finally support larger civilian investments. The growth rate is high and stable, so why not make it even higher?"
ECU_university:0 "Increase University Funding"
ECU_university_desc:0 "Our universities are underfunded and therefore can't function at full efficiency. Now that the economy and the state budget can finally support new investment projects, the universities should receive more funding."
ECU_focus_costa:0 "Development of the 'Costa'"
ECU_focus_costa_desc:0 "The Ecuadorian littoral is the most fertile part of our nation, being home to the majority of our plantations. In addition to fertile lands, it has easy access to the world market thanks to the various ports like Guayaquil. We should focus on the littoral."
ECU_focus_sierra:0 "Development of the 'Sierra'"
ECU_focus_sierra_desc:0 "The central parts of Ecuador, stuck in-between the flanks of Andes mountains, might not have the best suited land for agriculture, but some of the largest cities, especially Quito, lie in the 'Sierra'. Our industry could benefit from investments in the region."
ECU_mechanization:0 "Mechanisation of Cultures"
ECU_mechanization_desc:0 "New agricultural tools have revolutionized agriculture in the more developed nations. One of the main pillars of this agricultural revolution are new mechanized vehicles like trucks and tractors. We need to mechanize our agriculture to increase its output."
ECU_industrial_agriculture:0 "Industrial Agriculture"
ECU_industrial_agriculture_desc:0 "Agriculture and industry aren't antonyms! We should create a cooperation between our agricultural sector and the industrial sector to increase the productivity and output of the entire Ecuadorian economy."
ECU_quito_industry:0 "Expand the Quito Industries"
ECU_quito_industry_desc:0 "Quito is the centrepiece of the Ecuadorian industry. The largest portion of our industry is located in our beautiful capital, and its products can be found in stores around... well the few places who buy our goods. We need to invest more into its industry."
ECU_more_workers:0 "Promote the Factory Worker Life"
ECU_more_workers_desc:0 "Working in the factory isn't working yourself to death, it is working for a better life and a better future. That's what we need to make the peasants believe in order to create a larger potential workforce, creating new factories is useless if no one is there to work in them."
ECU_recovery:0 "In-depth Recovery"
ECU_recovery_desc:0 "Our economy has fully recovered from the economic troubles of the last years, and is now constantly growing and growing. Our industry has developed strongly and our agricultural output has hit new record numbers. Ecuador's economy is strong and will withstand the next crisis!"
ECU_domestic_arms:0 "A Domestic Arms Industry"
ECU_domestic_arms_desc:0 "Most of our military equipment is currently being imported from other countries, but who can be sure that we will forever be able to depend on imports? If the world ever ends up fighting a second Weltkrieg, our guns should be Ecuadorian and not American."

### Events ###
ecu.0.t:0 "Shadow of its Former Self"
ecu.0.d:0 "The state once known as Ecuador suffered some bumpy early years shortly after its independence in 1809. Border uncertainties led to conflicts with Peru and Colombia while rival oligarchies between large landowning conservatives in the highlands and the liberal populace on the coast fought each other bitterly. \nIn the midst of all this a disaster struck: Ecuador's only two neighbors, Colombia and Peru, began fighting a border war over the control of the Amazonian city of Leticia and it's immediate surroundings. The small conflict quickly became full-scale war, but the aggressor, Peru, wasn't able to make any gains and quickly turned its attention toward Ecuador.\nPlanning to march into Colombia via Quito, they sent an unexpected ultimatum to then president Alberto Guerrero Martinez, who quickly asked for international support to defend his country. However the rest of the world turned a blind eye to the matter and without any other option he pledged his allegiance to Colombia."
ecu.0.a:0 "How did that turn out?"
ecu.1.t:0 "Shadow of its Former Self pt.2"
ecu.1.d:0 "What followed was a complete embarrassment for the Ecuadorian people as the unprepared army struggled and soon failed to stop the invading Peruvian army.\nOnce the conflict ended, Ecuador lost its independence and was reduced to a puppet government by their former rival, losing all of its eastern territories and getting it's name changed to Quitaquil, while Colombia lost much of its southern land and fell into chaos. After a one year period of occupation, with things returning to apparent normality, Peru decided to allow an allied civil government to rule within the limit of regular administration. Thus ex-president Isidro Ayora Cuerva, who had once been the charismatic leader of the classical liberal party PLRE, was brought back to lead the country once again.\nDespite what the Peruvians think, the situation in Quitaquil is all but calm. No matter the decision by its overlord to make fringe groups such as socialists and national populists illegal, these extremists are incessantly working in the underground and attracting the public with their rebirth narrative.\nNonetheless, no one really knows what's in Quitaquil's future, neither Peru nor Quitaquil itself."
ecu.1.a:0 "Let's find out!"
ecu.2.t:0 "The March Crisis"
ecu.2.d:0 "The Conservatives have been doing quite the effort to pretend otherwise, but Black Monday has ruined Ecuador in a very thorough manner. Indeed, exports of cocoa from Ecuador dropped dramatically following the crash and unlike during the previous crash in 1925 when the conservatives held up on power, the political pressure has mounted, and riots broke out in Quito, Guayaquil and in many other cities, inspired by populist movements. Before all out civil war began, Enriquez Gallo and a clique of military men forced La Argolla and the Conservatives to step down, while chaos reigns in the streets!"
ecu.2.a:0 "Dios Mio!"
ecu.3.t:0 "The Ides of March"
ecu.3.d:0 "Gallo, the temporary head of state, ponders. Isidro Ayora and his Liberals have rather odd views on how the country should be run, and might be rather unfit for the job in these trying times. Peru looks at us with hunger, and a weak head of state might compromise completely the defence of our borders. The provisional government doesn't have a timetable to end until we actually call for elections, and the army and conservative elites would very likely back it. Gallo stood at the egde of a Rubicon, so to speak. What was his decision?"
ecu.3.a:0 "The elections will be held tomorrow."

Two main parties are disputing the presidency of our country: Isidro Ayora, of the Partido Liberal Radical, and Carlos Julio Arosemena Tola, of the Partido Conservador.

While their biggest leaders like Isidro Ayora and former president José María Velasco Ibarra have been distanced from any power, the parties still have many capable politicians and keep close ties to the rest of the elites in the country. However the dictatorship seems to have restarted the counters and no candidate looks particularly more advantaged than the other in the elections.

The conservative Argolla that was in power until the events of March 1936 was composed mainly of wealthy landowners of the Sierra and of conservative political elites including church members. But, as mentioned, the takeover of power by the liberals led by Ayora precipitated their fall into disgrace and while some try to hold on to positions of importance most have simply went back to their usual activity in hopes of better times for the conservatives in the future. What's sure is that the conservative Argolla definitely lost its hold on the country for this time, perhaps forever."

New laws are voted each day to strengthen his power and the one of the liberals in the country and it is murmured in the streets and in the newspapers that Ayora might style himself as a dictator, ignoring rules of democracy for his own power. Although those worries are well founded in facts, they don't seem to move the Ecuadorians much, considering this trend has been frequent during the whole history of Ecuatorian democracy. Nevertheless, it will become more and more difficult for the opposition to make its voice heard."
ecu.16.a:0 "A dictator? Don't you remember you elected me democratically?"
ecu.17.t:0 "New Laws for a Fairer Ecuador"
ecu.17.d:0 "The new majority in the assembly and the new liberal president have been at work to reform the country and break the influence of the former conservative elite. Part of that process is a classic move of centralisation of power around the president and growing authoritarianism in the Ecuadorian republic, however all of that is made very legally. Indeed, the parliament has been hard at work these last days voting laws reducing its own power and comforting the liberal supremacy despite criticisms from the opposition. This work will continue but the liberal group is divided about the response that should be given to the opposition forces. Should we try to work with them to ease the tensions and make the liberal rule more comfortable or should we refuse any compromise and implement all of what we want alone?"

There liberal politicians meet with wealthy cacao farmers of the coast and the most trendy bankers of Guayaquil. All of this elite, that met for the first time under Eloy Alfaro's regime at the turn of the century reunited for power under the new liberal leader and it is now with them that Ecuador is managed. And it's in this bar that the most important decisions of the country are actually negotiated or even decided. After all the interest of the bankers is to have clients and the interest of the farmers is to have money for their enterprise, in a country where export cultures make up most of the wealth, it is only natural for this duo to be in power..."
ecu.18.a:0 "The liberal world is back on track."
ecu.19.t:0 "The Rebirth of Guayaquil"
ecu.19.d:0 "Guayaquil, with its port and its banks, was the capital of the liberal world at the start of the 20th century. Even after that period, it stayed a close competer of the supremacy of Quito. The institution of the new Argolla gave wings to the city that is now booming with life again, while the important banks were broken up and controlled by the conservatives they are now regrouping to be as strong as ever and dominate the life in Guayaquil. At the port, exports were severely hit by the impact of Black Monday but cacao and bananas are now flowing again. The city became the point of attention of the whole country and many are the destitute farmers fleeing their land to find a job in the dream of the agitated nights of Guayaquil."
ecu.19.a:0 "Guayaquil, you are a lady!"
ecu.20.t:0 "The Banks' Actions Endanger Farmers"
ecu.20.d:0 "We should have known empowering bankers doesn't only come with advantages, and past examples in history have proven its danger. But nevertheless we didn't listen and gave too much leeway to the bankers in Guayaquil. With their newfound power they began funding and speculating on agriculture like never before, sadly not always to the advantage of the farmers. After a complex financial manipulation involving several relationships between farmers and loaners, a sudden destabilisation of the cultures in a region west of Guayaquil led to the bankruptcy of several cacao farmers, and much profit for the bankers. This unfortunate event turned into a national scandal when these influential farmers started agitating their colleagues against the government's favor toward the moneymen. Now, spread by newspapers and talked about on the street, we can't ignore this issue anymore and have to bring an answer to it. What will it be?"
ecu.20.a:0 "Punish the banks and relieve the farmers."
ecu.20.b:0 "Do nothing; after all this is the free market."
ecu.21.t:0 "Forming a Government"
ecu.21.d:0 "Gallo and his military clique just took over all the political powers in Ecuador and suspended the course of the usual constitution for the time being. As such, the government was dissolved and Gallo replaced it with an unofficial council of advisers largely taking from his friends in the military. However this situation can't last forever and if we want to bring stability to Ecuador we first have to provide it a stable government. Now the question is who to bring in it? Considering the discredit of the Conservative and Liberal parties, even if they are still the most powerful, allying with them would be risky and allying with the gruesome syndicalists of the PSE is out of question. We can also look to the way of the recently-founded Compactación Obrera Nacional, a populist party basing itself on the masses and its hate for syndicalism and created in response to the disaster of the economic crises, it's not the most popular amongst the Ecuadorian elites but it's the closest party to our ideology. Though whatever we choose, a good chunk of the important positions will still be filled by military men to secure the survival of the regime. What shall we do?"
ecu.21.a:0 "Use some elements from the Compactación."
ecu.21.b:0 "Take from all sides of the political spectrum to rally the people."
ecu.21.c:0 "Only the army knows best!"
ecu.22.t:0 "A Syndicalist Spy!"
ecu.22.d:0 "Our secret services surprised in the streets of Quito a man with a quite strange behaviour. He was walking, looking uncomfortable, constantly watching around him and some people say they saw a syndicalist emblem on part of his clothes. That's this last clue that convinced our secret services to investigate him more thoroughly. According to their reports they then discovered he wasn't a simple Ecuadorian citizen but a syndicalist spy working with the PSE and the French Commune to prepare a future revolution! This unacceptable threat was quickly removed with the sudden arrest of the spy in the middle of a meeting with corrupt politicians in a gloomy bar in Quito. With the spy now in jail and the country enraged at him, we must now decide his fate, should we leave him to a popular trial in the streets or should we prepare a grand and official trial to make an example of him?"
ecu.22.a:0 "Leave him to a popular 'trial'!"
ecu.22.b:0 "Make an official example of him to show those syndies!"
ecu.23.t:0 "The Grandiose Trial of the Spy"
ecu.23.d:0 "The syndicalist entered the great court of Quito at 8 in the morning, for the start of the trial, accompanied by the attorney chosen by the interior ministry. Facing him was the judge and most importantly, the prosecutor. In the room, hundreds of people pressed themselves to see the fate of the spy while his several crimes our secret services discovered were listed. After that, a brief time was left for his defence before the speech of the prosecutor and the quick decision of the judge: the spy is the culprit and will be executed by decapitation as soon as possible for the good of the Ecuadorian State. This exemplar protest will be an example for the future of our struggle against dissidents and syndicalists."
ecu.23.a:0 "And the head falls."
ecu.24.t:0 "Purifying the Press"
ecu.24.d:0 "As part of the process of strengthening the rule of the military in the country, one target will have to be the multiple newspapers Ecuador has. Coming from different sides of the political spectrum and influenced by big parties, the information and analysis conveyed in them don't always appeal to Gallo and might endanger the stability of the new state. As such a reorganisation of the press to bring it more in line with patriotic ideals will be started and we will make sure no one will spread dangerous reports in authorized newspapers anymore."
ecu.24.a:0 "Only the real patriots will stay."
ecu.25.t:0 "Dissent Amongst the Officers"
ecu.25.d:0 "As no revolts happened consequentially to the Gallo coup, it might be believed that all of the army got behind the new government but that would be a foolish assumption. Indeed, separate from Gallo's clique and more authoritarian leaning generals, there is an important fraction of the Ecuadorian military that follows progressive ideals and grows more and more opposed to the dictatorship of General Gallo. These officers and soldiers claim the army is here not to opress but to defend the people against enemies on the outside and the inside and that protecting democracy is also a part of that mission. This fraction is quickly becoming dangerous for the stability of the government that could be teared apart easily by intense infighting. To prevent this break up, the solution would be to make this fraction totally disappear in one way or another. A quick elimination will solve the problem immediately but will shock not only the people but also more military men and it might be wise to make this elimination more progressive. What will we do?"
ecu.25.a:0 "Purge the disloyals right now!"
ecu.25.b:0 "We will take more gradual steps..."
ecu.26.t:0 "Rallying the Army"
ecu.26.d:0 "The army has been a backbone of the construction and stabilisation of Ecuadorian democracy and as such also holds important leverage over its survival or not. To protect democracy, the army must be completely integrated into it and given positions of prestige amongst the Ecuadorian elites. At the same time, we'll teach the youth to love its army and will promote the military with programs throughout the whole nation. The army must become the most loyal defender of democracy if we want it to last."
ecu.26.a:0 "The army is the protector of democracy."

This is what happened this evening when 4 armed Peruvian river boats departed from the city to the Ecuadorian side of the Amazon and proceeded to sail back up the river. It took some time for the Ecuadorian army to warn the boats and force them to get back to where they came and it was long enough for them to provide an extensive reconnaissance of the area.

ECU_Enriquez_Gallo_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W July 24, 1894, in Latacunga, Cotopaxi province, Ecuador\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enriquez first saw himself in the military in 1900, when he met Eloy Alfaro after a battle against President Lizardo García's forces. Gallo's encounter with Alfaro instilled a selfless patriotism in him, leading him to volunteer in 1910 to fight against Perú. He was accepted as a drummer in the Pichicha battalion and reached the rank of Corporal before the war ended. He finally decided to abandon his studies in 1911, where he joined the Montero Revolutionary army. His first combat experience was holding a bridge against Flavio Alfaro's forces with tree soldiers, where they managed to hold out for a whole day successfully despite heavy fighting. In 1912 he was tasked by his CEO to apply for the 'Escuela de Aplicación para Militares Inferiores', graduating as a second lieutenant. From there he kept climbing through the ranks until becoming Captain in 1918. In 1922, he was sent to Guayaquil, where he ordered a bayonet charge against a group of strikers that were disturbing the peace in the city. Gallo saw them as a threat to Ecuador, ordering the execution of many strikers, who where then thrown in the Guayas River to dispose of the evidence. During the years of the Argolla clique, despite his ideological differences with the government, Gallo has followed orders and has strived to keep stability in Ecuador, allowing him to gain the rank of Field Marshall.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Despite having liberal views, Gallo worries more about Ecuador as a whole than about the Liberal/Conservative divide, and will do his duty no matter who's in charge."

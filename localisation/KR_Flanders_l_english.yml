### Events ###

fln.1.t:0 "Formation of the Coalition Government"
fln.1.d:0 "Elections have been issued by the National Assembly for the first time in our newly independent country. Many political movements across Flanders have seen this as their chance to make it as the main Flemish party. Due to the many contestants it seems that we will not be able to elect a sole winner and a coalition will have to be formed. At 18:00 the last polling stations closed and Van Zeeland announced the results of the First Flemish Election."
fln.1.a:0 "The VWP under Huysmans have taken the most seats!"
fln.1.b:0 "The VWP under Spaak have taken the most seats!"
fln.1.c:0 "The Catholic Flemish People's Party has taken the most seats!"
fln.1.e:0 "The Flemish Front has taken the most seats!"

fln.101.t:0 "Elections in Flanders"
fln.101.d:0 "After a stable government, it's once more time for the Flemish to vote. Both the KB and the VWP are polling well, with the VF following. At 18:00 the last voting booths closed with exit polls indicating victory."

fln.2.t:0 "Count Karel of Flanders Assumes Control"
fln.2.d:0 "To loud applause and with much fanfare, Karel van Belgie has taken control of the country and has assumed the position of Graaf van Vlaanderen. Based on the pre-Weltkrieg constitutional monarchy, he lacks absolute control and mostly serves symbolically to resolve political crises."
fln.2.a:0 "Good Luck Graaf Karel."

fln.21.t:0 "Adalbert Reascends the Throne"
fln.21.d:0 "The Aristocratic Council of Flanders has offered the Flemish crown to Adalbert if he agrees to rule only in name and further stays out of Flemish affairs. Through this action, the Council hopes to strengthen relations with Germany and further secure their independence from an aggressive Wallonia."
fln.21.a:0 "Long live Adalbert (again)!"

fln.3.t:0 "Verdinaso Takes Control"
fln.3.d:0 "Under the guise of providing stability and prosperity, Verdinaso, headed by Joris van Severen, has taken control of the country. Consisting of Flemish Council members, the party has an ideological inclination towards strong centralised government spearheaded by their party leader. Whether or not the newborn nation will benefit from this approach remains to be seen but the future will most definitely be interesting."
fln.3.a:0 "Van Severen takes the oath."

fln.4.t:0 "The VWP Reorganises the Cabinet"
fln.4.d:0 "With the victory of the French Commune, the Flemish lands now fall under French jurisdiction. A Syndicalist government has been brought to power and they have acted quickly eliminate all remnants of the old order. Parties like the old KB and the liberals have been made forbidden and a new constitution is being drafted based on the French example."
fln.4.a:0 "Rise up workers!"

#Zeeuws-Vlaanderen

fln.5.t:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Question"
fln.5.d:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen situation is a tricky one that has plagued our nation for years. The Dutch province is located on the southern bank of the Scheldt and has a strong Flemish attachment, but it has consistently refused integration into Belgium. Now with the Flanders itself an independent nation, a new push is being made by our government to convince the Zeeuws-Flemish people to join our country, thus securing our access to the Scheldt and consolidating our hold on the southern bank.\n\nTwo main proposals are being considered: the moderate wing of our government insists on pushing for a referendum, letting the people decide for themselves. Meanwhile our more aggressive political figures are keen to implement plans for a more direct path to integration. They want to infiltrate parts of their government and execute a quick and decisive blow when the time comes."
fln.5.a:0 "The people themselves may choose!"
fln.5.b:0 "Implement the 'Antigoon Plan'."

fln.51.t:0 "The Antigoon Plan"
fln.51.d:0 "We have designed a plan to both secure our rightful territory and to ensure that the Dutch people will be unable to military respond against us with the full force of their army. We will covertly arm Flemish patriots and nationalists in the Netherlands and place them at key strategic locations while our army mobilises in Ghent and Antwerp to cut off Dutch reinforcements. By executing a coup against the provincial administration and securing the arsenal at Terneuzen, we will be able to acquire an established grip on the province allowing us to concentrate all our forces on shoring up defensive positions behind the Adalbert Canal."
fln.51.a:0 "Put the plan in motion."
fln.51.b:0 "Back down."

fln.52.t:0 "Antigoon Excecuted"
fln.52.d:0 "At 11:00 AM, a group of well trained nationalists attacked the arsenal in Terneuzen, surprising the guards and infiltrating part of the compound. Meanwhile in Sluis and other villages in the province the town halls were taken by force and quickly secured. However elements of the Dutch army, which was unexpectedly in the midst of training exercises in the area, responded immediately. They managed to take back the arsenal and secure a strong defensive position, awaiting reinforcements from the main army."
fln.52.a:0 "Now is the time to attack, Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"

fln.6.t:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Referendum"
fln.6.d:0 "The Flemish government has approached us demanding that we attend to the will of our people and hold a referendum in the province of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. The Zeeuws-Flemish, although culturally very Flemish, have always stuck with us and are not very likely to abandon us. Nevertheless this may be risky as the will of the people is difficult to determine and "errors" can always happen."
fln.6.a:0 "Hold the referendum!"
fln.6.b:0 "Respectfully refuse their foolish request."

fln.61.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Referendum Refused"
fln.61.d:0 "The Dutch government has responded to our reasonable demands with outright denial, insisting that we have no claim on the region and that the people who live there have been and will always remain loyal citizens of the Netherlands."
fln.61.a:0 "They've silenced the people, we must protect them!"
fln.61.b:0 "We have no choice but to back down."

fln.7.t:0 "The Netherlands Allows a Referendum"
fln.7.d:0 "The Dutch government has agreed with us and are planning the referendum for later this month. Tensions are high on the border with residents from both sides rushing to sign up for the vote and sway the results in their favour. Nationalist propaganda is being spread by radio and even television, with Dutch newspapers flooding the streets. This will surely be an important day for Flanders and may even determine the course of its foreign policy."
fln.7.a:0 "Double our efforts to help the Flemish people!"

fln.8.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Joins Us!"
fln.8.d:0 "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and have decided to join the Flemish. The vote was ultimately decided by just two little villages bordering the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal that were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and as such voted heavily in favour of unification. The Dutch government has not yet responded to our requests for transfer of power and may still decide to label the referendum void."
fln.8.a:0 "One step closer to Great Flanders!"

fln.81.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes for Secession!"
fln.81.d:0 "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and have decided to join the Flemish. The vote was ultimately decided by just two little villages bordering the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal that were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and as such voted heavily in favour of unification. Rumours of election fraud are coming in however and we could still proclaim the referendum void."
fln.81.a:0 "Congratulate the Flemish government!"
fln.81.b:0 "The Flemish have tampered with the results, attack at once!"

fln.9.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes to Remain Dutch!"
fln.9.d:0 "With a large majority the people of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen have spoken and decided against Flemish annexation in favour of continued Dutch rule. During the prelude to the referendum, actions by the Flemish government led to an explosion of Flemish nationalism in Zeeuws-Vlaams. Some citizens even went as far as creating their own national anthem proclaiming themselves "a nation apart but still Dutch". The Flemish government has yet to respond to the outcome of the referendum."
fln.9.a:0 "Congratulate the Dutch government!"
fln.9.b:0 "The Dutch have tampered with the results, attack at once!"

fln.10.t:0 "The Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Referendum"
fln.10.d:0 "The Dutch government has agreed with the Flemish and are planning a referendum later this month in order to end tensions over the border region of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen. Tensions are high on the border with residents from both sides rushing to sign up for the vote and sway the vote in their favour. Nationalist propaganda is being spread by radio and even television, with Dutch newspapers flooding the streets. This will surely be an important day for Flanders and may even determine the course of its foreign policy."
fln.10.a:0 "We will follow these developments closely."

fln.11.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes for Secession"
fln.11.d:0 "Pulling in a close victory for the Flemish nationalists, the people have spoken and decided to join the Flemish nation. The vote was ultimately decided by just two little villages bordering the Ghent-Terneuzen Canal that were already very economically dependent on the Flemish country and as such voted heavily in favour of unification. The Dutch government has not yet responded to Flemish requests for the transfer of power and may still decide to label the referendum void."
fln.11.a:0 "A victory for the Flemish people."

fln.12.t:0 "Zeeuws-Vlaanderen Votes to Remain Dutch"
fln.12.d:0 "With a large majority the people of Zeeuws-Vlaanderen have spoken and decided against Flemish annexation in favour of continued Dutch rule. During the prelude to the referendum, actions by the Flemish government led to an explosion of Flemish nationalism in Zeeuws-Vlaams. Some citizens even went as far as creating their own national anthem proclaiming themselves "a nation apart but still Dutch". The Flemish government has yet to respond to the outcome of the referendum."
fln.12.a:0 "A victory for the Dutch people."

#Frans-Vlaanderen

fln.13.t:0 "The Flemish Situation in French Flanders"
fln.13.d:0 "After seizing the territories around Lille and Dunkerke from Flanders during the reign of Louis XIV, the French have made extensive efforts to undermine the Dutch language and marginalise the Flemish community. After the syndicalist revolution many of these Flemish nationals fled over the border to West-Flanders, awaiting German intervention to return to their homes. Centuries of French indoctrination however have undoubtedly left their mark and only a small Flemish minority still exists in the region making our claim weak at best.\n\nAs a result of the tensions in the region, a commission has been established, one tasked with improving conditions for the Flemish minority and to enthuse the rest to adapt to our language and culture."
fln.13.a:0 "We should reconsider this."
fln.13.b:0 "Back the Commission."

fln.14.t:0 "Plea to the Bishoprics"
fln.14.d:0 "Still devoutly Catholic, most of the Flemish living in Frans-Vlaanderen listen intently to their doctor and their pastor. Due to the hostility between the syndicalist government and the powerful bishoprics in the region, we could exploit these divisions to convince local church leaders to join our KB party and more importantly, tie them into our nation."
fln.14.a:0 "Strengthen Catholic ties."
fln.14.b:0 "This is a waste of time."

fln.15.t:0 "Investment Program in Frans-Vlaanderen"
fln.15.d:0 "While all contact with the Communard government in France is strictly forbidden, we can still covertly send money and resources to the Flemish companies and workers that live there. The continuation of the Caritas programme, invented by the Catholic Church, is intended to help the working class and by properly backing it we could increase the welfare of locals in the region and boost their sympathy towards Flanders. There are risks however, as this would undoubtedly be a very expensive project and it is unclear whether any meaningful results could be guaranteed."
fln.15.a:0 "Invest in Frans-Vlaanderen."
fln.15.b:0 "A complete misuse of resources."

fln.16.t:0 "Frans-Vlaanderen Restored to Flemish Rule!"
fln.16.d:0 "We have successfully driven off the French and retaken control of the region. A large renaming programme is already under way with cities like Lille changed to Rijsel and Dunkerke to Duinkerke. Putting aside extra government funds for refugee care and the restoration of the area could help us gain sympathy at little cost, and it would assist greatly in the integration process."
fln.16.a:0 "Allocate funds for refugee camps and repairs."

fln.17.t:0 "Francophone Protests"
fln.17.d:0 "Due to extensive efforts by the French government to increase the importance of the French language in the region, large swathes of land have become monolingual French and are resisting their new Flemish occupiers. To quell their resistance, we could allow the continuation of French facilities in those areas. This would decrease the amount of civil unrest in the region, but would unfortunately decrease the speed at which it would be successfully reintegrated into Flanders."
fln.17.a:0 "Setup French facilities."
fln.17.b:0 "Enforce the Flemish language!"

fln.18.t:0 "Bombing in Lille"
fln.18.d:0 "Unhappy with the Flemification of the province, French separatist movements have placed a bomb in the home of one of our top officials in the city of Lille. While he was able to escape unscathed, three of his family members and four members of his staff have perished in the explosion."
fln.18.a:0 "A sad day for all Flanders."

fln.19.t:0 "Bombing of the Yzer Tower"
fln.19.d:0 "Built after the Weltkrieg to commemorate fallen Flemish soldiers, the tower of Yzer has become a symbol of Flemish nationalism and peace. During this year's annual Yzer pilgrimage organised by members of the Frontpartij, a French anarchist has blown up the tower causing the total destruction of its support structure and the death of twenty-three Weltkrieg veterans. The Flemish public is outraged calling for a decisive and brutal response from the Vlaamse Wacht."
fln.19.a:0 "A symbol of peace no more."

fln.20.t:0 "Candle Wake for the Yzer"
fln.20.d:0 "In support of the casualties during the Yzer Tower attack, several small villages in Frans-Vlaanderen have expressed their condolences for the families of the victims by organising a special ceremony, followed by a very appropriate and moving speech from the mayors of the respective communities."
fln.20.a:0 "We should thank them for their support."

fln.201.t:0 "Integration of Frans-Vlaanderen"
fln.201.d:0 "It has taken a long time but at last can we count the people of Frans-Vlaanderen as true Flemish citizens. The Flemish language is slowly undergoing a resurgence and the final administrative reforms are passed. Frans-Vlaanderen is now officialy the sixth province of Flanders!"
fln.201.a:0 "We embrace them as brothers."

#First Days of the Nation

flnrev.1.t:0 "Dissolution of Flanders-Wallonia"
flnrev.1.d:0 "The nation of Flanders-Wallonia was only shortlived. Beset by widespread corruption, an absolutist monarch and corrosive German favouritism, it was only a matter of time before the powder keg inevitably exploded. Finally the Flemish have left the union and can finally for the first time in recent history celebrate their independence. From Oostende to Brussels to Hasselt Flemish lions are being paraded through the streets and across the nation chants of the Vlaamse Leeuw ring out. Still, such public displays of jubilation are little more than a front for the politics that happens behind closed doors."
flnrev.1.a:0 "Vlaanderen de Leeuw!"

flnrev.2.t:0 "Foundation of the Flemish National Congress"
flnrev.2.d:0 "With the German king ousted and the nation liberated, the once united parties of the revolution are slowly breaking apart. The Flemish Council claims that they are the only legitimate government and that only they should lead the nation until things have calmed down. The Catholic Flemish People's Party, the largest in the nation is divided with members of the Council supporting this regency and members who were seated in the pro-German Parliament. Neither group wishes to give up their power or allow their administrative organs to be abolished. The VWP is resolutely against any continuation of the old system as it forbade their participation and the party is continuing to bolster relations with the still armed revolutionaries. The Liberation army meanwhile is torn between allegiance to the Catholic Flemish People's Party and their self appointed leaders who are vying for control of the state."
flnrev.2.a:0 "The First National Congress ends in failure."

flnrev.3.t:0 "The Council Seizes Control"
flnrev.3.d:0 "To preserve their power and keep the national situation under control, the Flemish Council has, with the assistance of the Vlaamse Wacht, seized control of the Assembly stationing forces at all entrances and throughout the surrounding city blocks. Van Severen has used this opportunity to stand before the Assembly and give his speech, trying to convince them of the necessity of stability and preservation of the old system. While he has mild success in convincing some members, most of them are waiting for the Liberation army to launch a counter-attack against the Vlaamse Wacht and liberate the Assembly."
flnrev.3.a:0 "The situation is escalating."

flnrev.4.t:0 "Divisions Within the Liberation Army"
flnrev.4.d:0 "With the Assembly being kept hostage, the Liberation army is increasingly becoming plagued by internal strife and divided leadership.\n\nLed by Charles Claser, the Secret Legion stands by the dissolution of the Flemish Council and the creation of a new Flemish state. The Frontbeweging on the other hand, mainly composed of of Weltkrieg veterans, stands by the Flemish Council and has been tearing men away from the combined effort to support the Vlaamse Wacht. The Geuzengroep is torn apart between its founding members who were part of the Vlaamse Wacht and the recruited partisans who fought out of anti-German sentiment and general discontent with the Flemish Council.\n\nA fourth faction has also emerged during the rebellion, consisting of mainly Dutch volunteers and Groot-Nederlands sympathisers. While their numbers are limited, support from the Dutch army and a stalemate between the other factions could result in their victory.\n\nWith no end in sight, the different factions are seeking the disarming of the others and to use the influence of both Church and State to achieve their goals."
flnrev.4.a:0 "The Secret Legion achieves a majority."
flnrev.4.b:0 "The Frontbeweging wins over the Geuzengroep."
flnrev.4.c:0 "The Groot-Nederlandisten strengthen their power."

#Secret Legion

flnrev.51.t:0 "Secret Legion Emerges Victorious the Stalemate"
flnrev.51.d:0 "By sowing discontent in the ranks of the Frontbeweging and winning over the recruits of the Geuzengroep, the Secret Legion has been able to convince enough members of the resistance to their cause to force total disarmament on the other factions. While most of them have agreed with these terms and laid down their weapons, small pockets of radicals still remain throughout the countryside trying to gain the support of farmers and royalist civilians."
flnrev.51.a:0 "Move on the capital!"

flnrev.52.t:0 "Clashes Between the Vlaamse Wacht and the Secret Legion"
flnrev.52.d:0 "The Secret Legion has finally achieved enough control to liberate the Assembly and are moving into Brussels trying to break the Vlaamse Wacht's strangehold over the city and the national leadership. Inside the Assembly, Van Severen is still trying to convince members to support the continuation of the Flemish Council but word is spreading through the ranks that the Libertion Army is moving in."
flnrev.52.a:0 "The Secret Legion defeats the Vlaamse Wacht."
flnrev.52.b:0 "The Vlaamse Wacht holds out against the Secret Legion."

flnrev.53.t:0 "Liberation of the National Assembly"
flnrev.53.d:0 "With the defeat of the Vlaamse Wacht, the last power base of the Council has been disbanded and a new government can be established. Rooting out the remnants of their organisation will take time and effort though as last of their supporters still hold out in some of the Flemish villages."
flnrev.53.a:0 "A provisional government is established."

#Frontbeweging

flnrev.61.t:0 "The Frontbeweging Unifies With the Geuzengroep"
flnrev.61.d:0 "Efforts by the Secret Legion to win the support of the Geuzengroep recruits have been successfully repulsed and even though their member count has dropped, reinforcement of the movement by experienced veterans of the Frontbeweging has enabled the combined group to consolidate their power and face the Secret Legion head on."
flnrev.61.a:0 "The Secret Legion refuses disarmament!"

flnrev.62.t:0 "Clashes Between the Secret Legion and the Frontbeweging"
flnrev.62.d:0 "Seeing themselves as the last protectors of Flemish liberalism, the Secret Legion has entrenched itself in West-Flanders, recruiting civilians and repulsing attacks by the combined movement. The Frontbeweging has decided to post a large portion of their forces to feguard the movement while reinforcements are sent to Brussels to increase pressure on the Assembly."
flnrev.62.a:0 "The Council controls the army!"

flnrev.63.t:0 "The National Assembly Gives In"
flnrev.63.d:0 "Either convinced by the speeches of Van Severen and other Council members or pressured by the armed forces outside, the Assembly has given in and voted in favour of maintaining the continued existence of the Flemish Council. While all parties openly support the decision, behind the scenes plans for a more democratic government are being created."
flnrev.63.a:0 "The Flemish Council rules supreme."

flnrev.631.t:0 "Destruction of the Secret Legion"
flnrev.631.d:0 "After their victory in Brussels, the forces of Flanders have turned their eyes back to West-Flanders where the last remnants of the Secret Legion have embedded themselves. By offering full amnesty to all who surrender as recognition of their deeds in the liberation of Flanders, many Legion members surrendered to the Flemish forces allowing for a swift end to the surviving extremist elements."
flnrev.631.a:0 "Peace has once again been secured."

flnrev.64.t:0 "Continue the Regency?"
flnrev.64.d:0 "In theory the Flemish Council is supposed to rule until a new king is chosen. While the more conservative members are willing to push the Council further in this direction, more radical elements have been openly calling for the abolition of the Regency clause and to continue ruling free from the restrictions of the monarchy. This faction, led by Van Severen and some of his close allies, has gained the support from the Vlaams Nationaal Verbond, led by Staff de Clercq. Although the VNV has so far been barred from entering the Council due to its populist viewpoints, support for Van Severen is limited at best and he will need all the support he can get."
flnrev.64.a:0 "Van Severen and the VNV unite against the Regency."
flnrev.64.b:0 "The Regency continues."

flnrev.641.t:0 "Frontbeweging Reforms into the Frontpartij"
flnrev.641.d:0 "With the Flemish Council firmly in power and reinforced by the Vlaamse Wacht, the Frontbeweging has agreed to lay down its arms. Prominent members of the movement have been awarded seats in the Council and have created their own party: the Frontpartij. They are strong supporters of the independent Flemish nation and have petioned for a rewards program for successful Resistance members."
flnrev.641.a:0 "A first step towards a peaceful democracy."

flnrev.81.t:0 "The VNV and Van Severen Unite"
flnrev.81.d:0 "Due to the most unfortunate resignations of some of staunchest royalists in the Council and their replacement by VNV nationalists, Van Severen has acquired a slim majority. A vote on the continuation of the Regency will be the first point on the agenda during the next session and it looks set to be easily repulsed by his followers."
flnrev.81.a:0 "Dark times are approaching."

flnrev.82.t:0 "Resistance From the Frontbeweging"
flnrev.82.d:0 "While the Frontbeweging supported the Council during the early days of the nation, this have heavily frowned upon its power grab. Many members of the movement have publicly spoken out against Van Severen in the Council, switching sides to the royalists. Though this is a mild setback for Van Severen's plans, further replacement of the Council members should still sway the vote in his favour."
flnrev.82.a:0 "The vote is approaching."

flnrev.83.t:0 "End of the Regency"
flnrev.83.d:0 "With a small majority, Van Severen has been able to win the vote thus ending the Regency and replacing the monarchy with a more autocratic regime. The Flemish Council now retains full control of the Government and decides on all matters of state. While new members can still enter the Council, most seats are reserved for Van Severen's most loyal supporters thus repressing any real form of opposition."

While their impact so far has been fairly limited and their size is diminishing due to German and now Flemish policies, the VNV has urged the Council to take a more forceful approach. They have demanded the complete abolition of French education and the unification of the VUB and ULB. All streets refering to French speaking Brusselois are to be changed and a strict uniform Flemish language enforced on the population."

The leader of the VNV, Staf De Clerq, has mobilized the Diets Militia, the party’s paramilitary wing, in an all-out attack on the city of Brussels. Local police are now engaged in sporadic block-by-block combat as De Clerq’s militia have launched an attack on key government buildings in an attempt to seize power. While the situation seems dire, Van Severen and the Flemish Council have put their faith in a detachment of the army that is en route to Brussels to relieve the beleaguered police forces and restore order to the city.

Borrowing heavily from the disintegrating Van Severen faction, the conservative Catholics and some of the liberals, the movement is steadily growing in power and confidence.

While they are still the smallest faction in the Liberation Army, they are starting to sway popular opinion by promoting the Flemish unification with the Netherlands and a stronger global Flanders. Without the armed support that the other factions enjoy however, they are unlikely to be able to achieve these goals.

With no chance of success on their own, the movement will now inevitably have to pick a side in the conflict between the Secret Legion and the Frontbeweging in order to survive. While siding with the Secret Legion may guarantee a shot at winning the coming elections and free promotion of the movement, siding with the Frontbeweging has its own benefits. Van Severen has already shown strong tendencies towards a pro-Dutch unification stance and siding with him may fulfil our goals."

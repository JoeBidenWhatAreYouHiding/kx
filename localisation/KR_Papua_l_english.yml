PNG_radical_socialist_party:0 "Committee of Thirteen"
PNG_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Committee of Thirteen\n§gThe Committee of Thirteen is a relatively disjointed political body that has rallied behind the native trade unionist Sumsuma of Boang Island, King of the Tanga people, promoting his ideas of a \"national union\" between all races of Papua and New Guinea. It is generally made up of natives who have been educated at mission schools or who have simply worked their way up through the labour movement to gain political significance. As such, the Committee's rhetoric is generally tinged with Christian appeals to universal human brotherhood and a strong emphasis on equality and workers rights. Though few, if any of the members of the group have ever read socialist theory, they have maintained connections to the American International Longshore and Warehouse Union and understand some elements of vulgar Marxism. The Committee favours that Papua and New Guinea should be governed by federal means, where each ethnic group and clan has a degree of autonomy to pursue their own ways of life.§!"

PNG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Yali Movement\n§gThe Yali Movement is the common term used to describe a religious and political movement led by Yali of Sor and his chief theologian and prophet, Gurek of Hapurpi. At its core, the Yali Movement is similar to many of the other \"Cargo Cults\" scattered across Papua: it preaches that the Europeans' material goods are a product of either divinely granted knowledge or direct intervention and that through virtuous living, proper worship and pagan ritual its adherents can accumulate material goods that will benefit them, and these material goods are then in and of themselves worshipped as being gifts from a higher power. Where the Yali Movement differs is its heavy reliance on \"teaching\", with its charismatic founder and political leader Yali and its chief military strategist Kaum of Kalinam having gained renown not just by bestowing physical material goods, but also by instructing the various tribes and clans they have visited on how to improve their farming and hygiene, as well as how to best defy the German colonial oppressors. The cult's religious leaders like Gurek and Kaum frequently travel all around Papua preaching its message, each with an entourage consisting of helpers and wives that the leaders recruit from the villages they visit, while Yali’s own semi-secular political organization that was fused into the cult upon his induction serves as their administrative front, but has started to fade into irrelevance, with Yali himself finding himself more and more surrounded by men and women that revere him not as a leader or statesman but as a living god toward whom even the birds of sky sing their praises. Regardless, the Yali movement claims the people must turn toward a more virtuous life and return back to the old gods, so that they'll give their blessing of cargo on their faithfuls, with which they will be able to forge an independent nation that can stand on the world stage, free of imperialist control and Abrahamic European dominance, although the cult specifies very little of how this nation will look like.§!"

POLITICS_SUMSUMA_DESC:0 "Sumsuma was born around 1903 on Boang Island, German New Guinea. An ethnic Tanga, his Filamat clan was one of many coaxed down from the highlands to settle on the coast, where the Germans could be more easily tax them. His childhood was troubled, with his father living on another island and his mother often beating him. At age 10 he ran away to enlist on a ship, later finding refuge at a Methodist mission in Neumecklenburg. There he learned German and the Bible, before returning to the sea.\n\nThroughout the 1910s he worked on cargo boats in Rabaul, gaining the nickname Tolimlimbur (Wanderer) for his travels between the islands. Sumsuma was likely the highest paid native in all of New Guinea, a cunning negotiator adept at rising through the white man's world. But shamed by the rampant inequality he profited from and influenced by the American ILWU and sympathetic Afro-American sailors, in December 1928 Sumsuma summoned his comrades to strike for equal wages so that every man could be as rich as him.\n\nMost natives had no experience with organising, but Sumsuma took cues from prior successful strikes on the ship Ralum and the island of Samarai. He sent messages to every group of workers in Rabaul, from sailors to bookbinders to policemen, inviting them to meetings at the local Christian missions. He spoke to crowds of thousands and told them not to return to work, marking the beginning of the strike. Out of practically nothing, Sumsuma managed to build class consciousness and rallying the disparate New Guinean clans against the white bosses.\n\nFaced with violence by the police and Schutztruppe sent by the hostile \"Citizen's Committee\", Sumsuma and his comrades were imprisoned and tortured for several years. Released home to Boang, he was shaken but not hopeless. He set about trying to rebuild his movement, creating agricultural cooperatives among the Tanga and earning the respect of local \"luluais\" (Chieftains).\n\nIn the power vacuum that formed after New Guinea's liberation, the lulais elected Sumsuma as \"King of the Tanga\", a position he utilized to establish ties with various Christian groups and workers' associations. In time, these coalesced into the \"Committee of Thirteen\", consisting of Sumsuma's older allies as well as a younger generation keen on supporting his \"national union\" between all ethnic groups across the islands."

POLITICS_YALII_DESC:0 "Born in the Ngaing bush area near Sor village, itself along the Rai Coast within the Madang District of German New Guinea, in 1912 as a member of the Walaliang patriclan and the Tabinung matriclan, Yali is the charismatic and infamous face of the Fifth Cargo Belief, or the Yali Movement as it has become increasingly known thanks to his own power-mongering. Although his father had been an important community leader, Yali himself was not trained in the traditional ways of his forefathers, instead leaving home at a young age to work for the Europeans, briefly returning in 1931 to be named Tutltul, or second in command to the Lulai chief, of Sor before his wife died around the end of 1936 which prompted him back into European employ as he joined the colonial police force. It was also during this time employed by the colonial police force that he was first exposed to a cargo cult, being the one on Karkar Island just off the northern Papuan coast, where one of its seers foresaw a prophecy of a German attack that later happened as he predicted it, impressing Yali and planting the seed in his mind that would later cause him to follow Gurtek of the Fifth Cargo Belief upon their meeting years later. While working with groups like the Dutch, Germans, and Australians, and despite a thorough understanding in their languages or customs, Yali would discover that many Europeans were ambivalent towards Christianity and was taught the theory of evolution, seeing these revelations as proof that the missionaries had been intentionally dishonest in an attempt to manipulate and profit off the natives. This would lead him to abandon Christian faith in favor of traditional Papuan animist paganism and tribal traditionalism as he evolved into an anti-imperialist activist and political firebrand, while also falling in with other anti-colonial activists like Tagarab of Milguk who helped organize the Rabaul Strike of 1928. Upon joining Gurtek and the Belief, Yali would integrate his own political movement into the group in order to function as its official face and administration while secretly using it behind the scenes to slowly take control of the cult himself. Despite growing concerns over his desire for absolute control over not just the Fifth Cargo Belief but all of Papua New Guinea, as well as the violent and depraved acts against innocent civilians and missionaries that he and his paramilitary police forces have committed, Yali has been able to largely act with impunity thanks to his charismatic manipulations and bloody corruptions of local society, becoming the undisputed master of Papua New Guinea."

PNG_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Committee of Thirteen\n§gThe Committee of Thirteen is a relatively disjointed political body that has rallied behind the native trade unionist Sumsuma of Boang Island, King of the Tanga people, promoting his ideas of a \"national union\" between all races of Papua and New Guinea. It is generally made up of natives who have been educated at mission schools or who have simply worked their way up through the labour movement to gain political significance. As such, the Committee's rhetoric is generally tinged with Christian appeals to universal human brotherhood and a strong emphasis on equality and workers rights. Though few, if any of the members of the group have ever read socialist theory, they have maintained connections to the American International Longshore and Warehouse Union and understand some elements of vulgar Marxism. The Committee favours that Papua and New Guinea should be governed by federal means, where each ethnic group and clan has a degree of autonomy to pursue their own ways of life.§!"

An extremely decentralized group, Mambu’s control is mainly expressed through a network of ministers and his ability to both ordain and excommunicate them. For the laity, membership is mainly defined by giving a \"head tax\" to the Black King Mambu and accepting the cult’s sacrament like its baptism, during which the new believers would cast off their old breech-cloths and grass shirts, have their genitals sprinkled with holy water and swear to abandon native apparel, only wearing European clothes from now on.§!"

PNG_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Yali Movement\n§gThe Yali Movement is the common term used to describe a religious and political movement led by Yali of Sor and his chief theologian and prophet, Gurek of Hapurpi. At its core, the Yali Movement is similar to many of the other \"Cargo Cults\" scattered across Papua: it preaches that the Europeans' material goods are a product of either divinely granted knowledge or direct intervention and that through virtuous living, proper worship and pagan ritual its adherents can accumulate material goods that will benefit them, and these material goods are then in and of themselves worshipped as being gifts from a higher power. Where the Yali Movement differs is its heavy reliance on \"teaching\", with its charismatic founder and political leader Yali and its chief military strategist Kaum of Kalinam having gained renown not just by bestowing physical material goods, but also by instructing the various tribes and clans they have visited on how to improve their farming and hygiene, as well as how to best defy the German colonial oppressors. The cult's religious leaders like Gurek and Kaum frequently travel all around Papua preaching its message and appointing with the approval of Yali local 'boss-men' to act as the local representative of the greater movement, in a feudal pyramid under Yali's watchful authority.§!"

POLITICS_SUMSUMA_DESC:0 "Sumsuma was born around 1903 on Boang Island, German New Guinea. An ethnic Tanga, his Filamat clan was one of many coaxed down from the highlands to settle on the coast, where the Germans could be more easily tax them. His childhood was troubled, with his father living on another island and his mother often beating him. At age 10 he ran away to enlist on a ship, later finding refuge at a Methodist mission in Neumecklenburg. There he learned German and the Bible, before returning to the sea.\n\nThroughout the 1910s he worked on cargo boats in Rabaul, gaining the nickname Tolimlimbur (Wanderer) for his travels between the islands. Sumsuma was likely the highest paid native in all of New Guinea, a cunning negotiator adept at rising through the white man's world. But shamed by the rampant inequality he profited from and influenced by the American ILWU and sympathetic Afro-American sailors, in December 1928 Sumsuma summoned his comrades to strike for equal wages so that every man could be as rich as him.\n\nMost natives had no experience with organising, but Sumsuma took cues from prior successful strikes on the ship Ralum and the island of Samarai. He sent messages to every group of workers in Rabaul, from sailors to bookbinders to policemen, inviting them to meetings at the local Christian missions. He spoke to crowds of thousands and told them not to return to work, marking the beginning of the strike. Out of practically nothing, Sumsuma managed to build class consciousness and rallying the disparate New Guinean clans against the white bosses.\n\nFaced with violence by the police and Schutztruppe sent by the hostile \"Citizen's Committee\", Sumsuma and his comrades were imprisoned and tortured for several years. Released home to Boang, he was shaken but not hopeless. He set about trying to rebuild his movement, creating agricultural cooperatives among the Tanga and earning the respect of local \"luluais\" (Chieftains).\n\nIn the power vacuum that formed after New Guinea's liberation, the lulais elected Sumsuma as \"King of the Tanga\", a position he utilized to establish ties with various Christian groups and workers' associations. In time, these coalesced into the \"Committee of Thirteen\", consisting of Sumsuma's older allies as well as a younger generation keen on supporting his \"national union\" between all ethnic groups across the islands."

POLITICS_MAMBU_DESC:0 "Mambu of Apingam is a man whose history is shrouded in myths. For the white men, he was a normal Catholic catechist who, after a brief spell as a contract worker in Rabaul, one Sunday after behaving weirdly for the entire day, simply left the church to never return, only to later reappear in the village of Apingam and later among the Tangu people preaching his anti-missionary creed. His followers tell another tale.\n\nFor them, after finishing is spell as a contract worker, Mambu stowed away in a steamer bound for Australia to learn the secret of the white man, only to be discovered by the captain and be almost killed if not by the intervention of his former employer, who brought him to Australia, to be welcomed as a guest in his house. His \"master\" (for that is how the whites request to be called in Papua) showed him the sights and gave him cargo: rice, spare clothing, beads, knives, canned goods, razor blades—heaps of good things. Finally, he was told to go home with his cargo, armed with a letter from his master’s sister to show to anyone that questioned him. His followers recount how perilous Mambu’s return to Papua was, with him surviving several attempts by the captain to throw him overboard, and of how, when he finally managed to return, he started doing what he is doing now: preaching to the people! As he now knew the secrets of the cargo and of how the jealous white men were trying to prevent \"Kanakas\" like the Papuans to obtain it. They should be strong and throw the white men out of New Guinea into the sea. And to make themselves strong Kanakas needed money. To this end Mambu travelled around the countryside collecting pennies and shillings. But for doing so Mambu was reported to the administration by a missionary and then gaoled, as he was dangerous to white men, only to be freed with the fall of colonial dominion over the island."

POLITICS_YALI_DESC:0 "A Ngaing born in 1912 along the Rai Coast near Sor village as a member of the Walaliang patriclan and the Tabinung matriclan, Yali is the charismatic leader of the Yali Movement. Although his father was a respected master of the traditional sacred knowledge, Yali himself was not trained in the ways of his forefathers, instead leaving home at a young age to work for the Europeans in Wau where he became fast friends with his later religious and political rival Tagarab of Milguk. Briefly returning in 1931 to be named Tutltul of Sor (Tultul being a form of village chief, second to the local Lululai) he quickly returned to European employ in the colonial police force following the death of his wife. It was during his service as a policeman that he was first exposed to explicit cargo thinking by disgruntled fellow policemen, all sure that the secret of cargo found in Christianity was kept hidden from them. It was also as a policeman that Yali was able to see to modern cities like Singapore when he was called to quell the riots caused by the Black Monday. Here, Yali would discover something that shocked him to the very core: the story of Adam and Eve, taught by all the missionaries in and around Papua was a lie. Instead of believing themselves descendant from a primordial couple, Europeans considered their progenitors to be animals like monkeys. For him this was proof that the missionaries had been completely dishonest with the natives on the most fundamental level, as they lied even on the origin of all things! This would lead to his abandonment of the Christian faith in favor of traditional Papuan animist paganism and tribal traditionalism and his evolution into an anti-imperialist activist and political firebrand. When Gurek approached him and explained his theology, he would find in Yali both an eager disciple and a Messiah, eager to learn the traditional knowledge he wasn't taught as a young man and eager to lead his people in a holy war for independence."

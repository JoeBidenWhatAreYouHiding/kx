### Ideas ###

LEB_united_front:0 "United Front"
LEB_united_front_desc:0 "The Lebanese people are emboldened by their opposition to tyranny and their cries for liberty. Despite the millennia of conflict between the different religious groups of Lebanon, we are all aware that we share a common enemy. The Ottomans and the Syrians have tried to play us off against each other, only seeking to curry our favour to further their own hegemony, with little care for the tyranny they’ve inflicted on the Lebanese people. We know that to oppose them we need to stand united, so for now it is all smiles above the table but daggers drawn beneath it. Until we have won our liberty with blood, sweat and toil, a strained sense of comradery binds us all together."
LEB_economic_upheaval:0 "Economic Upheaval"
LEB_economic_upheaval_desc:0 "Whilst Lebanon has been a center of trade and commerce for millenia, our dependance on the Ottoman Empire severely stifled our economic influence. The Port of Beirut has been under direct Ottoman control for almost a century, during which it existed mostly to direct trade from the Mashriq towards the Turkish metropole. With the empire in collapse and the Turkish economy in a downward spiral, alongside the fact numerous new trade routes and economic blocs have been created in the rapidly changing Middle East, we are faced with the inevitable need to undergo a vast transformation of our economic system or face complete destitution."

LEB_legacy_of_the_mutasarrifate_desc:0 "The rule of the second Mutasarrifate has been a time of healing and recovery for the weary Lebanese people, but not quite comfortable enough to make us complacent in the face of oppression. As political movements had the chance to come back out into the open, the nationalists and reformers in Lebanon have become far better organized and unified, which bodes well for shaping the future of our nascent state. The cornerstones of the Lebanese nation have already been laid by the political factions and coalitions forged during the period of the second Mutasarrifate."

Whilst some cross sectarian alliances exist, there’s also notable extremists in each camp, who want to enforce their own religious rule over the Lebanese nation. In order for Lebanon to remain stable and prosperous, peace must be forged between these conflicting groups, either through negotiation or force, and a stable government that everyone can accept or one specific group can personally enforce, must be established."

### Events ###

leb.1.t:0 "Our Independence Achieved"
leb.1.d:0 "After several weeks of struggle, the armies of Syria have finally stopped their attack on our nation, and their government has agreed to a ceasefire.\nIn this momentous occasion, most of the Country rejoices, as the oppression of Lebanon draws to a close; and although some within our borders don't approve of our newfound independence, notably the Sunnis and their Syrian Social Nationalist Party, the streets of our country are filled with enthusiasm as the Provisional President announces the liberation of Lebanon."
leb.1.a:0 "Long Live Lebanon!"

leb.2.t:0 "The Collapse of the United Front"
leb.2.d:0 "While we had hoped that the wide United Front under Chehab would last enough time to guarantee a safe transition towards democracy, it seems this isn't going to be the case.\nFollowing the end of the Independence War, factional rivalries, policy differences, and clan rivalries have torn our national government apart. Starting today, the democratic parties have withdrawn their support of the Provisional President's interim mandate. This leaves us in a peculiar position, as the President is indeed in favour of a democratic restoration, however both him and the parties see an immediate election as dangerous. The situation is reaching a deadlock, though it appears it will undoubtedly be broken in a matter of days."

leb.3.t:0 "The Provisional Parliament demands Fuad Chehab Step Down"
leb.3.d:0 "As expected, the political deadlock has been broken; the Parties seem to have grown weary of Chehab's presidency, and made a joint statement calling for the resignation of the Provisional President and the formation of a temporary parliamentary administration until elections can be held.\nWhile Chehab is indeed in favour of a restoration of democracy, he has noted that laying down powers to the Parliament might be the chance for dangerous scenarios to rise, one of these being a return of the various political dynasties, which Chehab very much opposes due to their corrupted political ways, or the rise of some radical militarist movements to replace the political weight of the Volunteers' Army.\n\nWhatever the case, Chehab must now decide: will the Provisional Presidency survive, or will the Parliament have its demands met?"
leb.3.a:0 "Give in to the demands"
leb.3.b:0 "Our nation isn't ready yet!"

leb.4.t:0 "Dealing with the Dynasties"
leb.4.d:0 "The great Maronite political dynasties of Lebanon have been in control of the country ever since the Mutasarrifate was formed back in 1860, their power and presence always felt at all political and economic levels. After the governorship of Djemal Pasha, the families returned, spearheaded by the Arslan and Jumblatt Druze families.\nThe families form an extremely powerful, though corrupted, political bloc; and some fear that they could effectively take control of the upcoming elections from the shadows.\nAs such, the Reform Society and the Army are both in favour of limiting their overall influence through special legislation; however, the Constitutionalists, who enjoy the support of the Families, are deeply opposed to such a move, and they might end up having the final say on the matter."
leb.4.a:0 "Collaboration might be best..."
leb.4.b:0 "Move to curb their power!"

leb.5.t:0 "Dealing with the Republican Movement"
leb.5.d:0 "After Chehab's refusal to leave the Provisional Presidency, the democratic parties unified as a single parliamentary bloc in order to protect the country from Chehab's 'dictatorial' turn. In spite of this, it was clear that such a pact was not going to last, as the internal differences between the factions was too great.\nAs such a chance has opened up to break this unnatural coalition: disillusioned by the Constitutionals' arabist and conservative policies, the Reform society has offered political collaboration with the arguably progressive Provisional Presidency."
leb.5.a:0 "Let us join forces with the Reformists!"
leb.5.b:0 "This is too dangerous of a move..."

leb.6.t:0 "Sunni Riots"
leb.6.d:0 "Being left aside in the political situation of our country, the Sunni populace has taken the streets in protests, to make their voice heard in the next elections.\nAs noble as this goal was, the situation has deteriorated, with widespread riots erupting and the suspicion of Syrian involvement arising.\nIn this precarious situation, the Marada Movement has proposed in the Provisional Parliament their militias step in in the Government's name and restore order to the Sunni areas of the country; an offer that is indeed worth considering, since sending in the Army might prove dangerous and attract reprisals from across the border."
leb.6.a:0 "Allow the Marada to move in!"
leb.6.b:0 "Call in the army!"

leb.7.t:0 "Marada Demand Seats"
leb.7.d:0 "During the War of Liberation, the Marada served alongside the Volunteers' Army, gaining sizeable support due to their daring tactics, but nevertheless received a relatively low number of seats in the Provisional Parliament.\nThis prompted the Movement to call upon our democratic values and, seeing their widespread support, grant them more seats even before elections have been held, in order to solidify the democratic (and Maronite) character of our Nation and to impede parliamentary meddling in the forthcoming elections.\nWhile they are highly hypocritical in appealing to the democratic process, themselves being little more than reactionary thugs, we could prove ourselves hypocritical too in not allowing the democratic process to proceed, in order to protect the democratic process."
leb.7.a:0 "We will be better than them..."
leb.7.b:0 "We will defend our democracy!"

leb.8.t:0 "A Threat from Within"
leb.8.d:0 "President Chehab's refusal to let go of the temporary presidency have kickstarted a smearing campaign by the Republican Movement against his person.\nIn fact, despite our President being a die-hard republican, the Movement has already accused him of trying to bring the Lebanese Emirate, which his family ruled, back to life and to be plotting a monarchist self-coup against the democratic apparatus of the Republic.\nWhile such claims are obviously baseless and are appearing because of Chehab's opposition to the political families that support the Constitutionalists and the Nationalists, the campaign has nevertheless damaged Chehab's reputation, and despite our best efforts, it will be a while before the effects of these attacks are completely vanished."
leb.8.a:0 "We will have to live with this"

leb.9.t:0 "The New Constitution"
leb.9.d:0 "After long debates, a draft of the new constitution of the Lebanese Republic has been approved.\nAmong its basic principles stand the recognition of the democratic process, the freedom of speech and of press, the freedom of assembly and a recognition of human dignity and rights.\nAnd, among those, stands a recognition of the multi-religious, multi-cultural character of our Lebanese nation, giving our compatriots the right to profess any religion and recognising their customs.\nWhile there are those who oppose the new statute, namely the Marada movement, it is clear that the many ethnicities of our country will prosper under the masterpiece that is our new Constitution."
leb.9.a:0 "Long Live our Republic!"

leb.10.t:0 "The Marada Coup"
leb.10.d:0 "Lights went out in Beirut tonight as militias of the Marada movement seized control over strategic positions in the city, disarming police and military checkpoints. Although armed with little more than scraps from the black market and Ottoman leftovers, they seem to have made up for their lack in strength with a form of unbridled enthusiasm. For many Beiruti citizens however, the coup attempt feels as yet another page in a long and drawn out history of political upheaval.\n\nWith gunshots echoing in the night, various reports of arrests and beatdowns are spreading through the city of political representatives and party leaders, dragged out of their houses and gathered on the square in front of the Parliament building. Although initially taken by surprise, rumour has it that elements loyal to the republic and its democratic system are arming themselves and planning a counter-attack. Whatever the outcome, it seems likely that once more the streets of Beirut will see blood."
leb.10.a:0 "The Marada take over the government!"
leb.10.b:0 "The militias are repelled!"

leb.11.t:0 "God, Fatherland, Family"
leb.11.d:0 "As the sun rises over Beirut, it has become clear that the Marada movement has succeeded in their plan. With victory now finally secured, all of Lebanon now falls under the guidance of their movement and its noble leader, Bachir Gemayel! A glorious day in the eyes of his followers, while many others have cowered in their homes as the dream of a peaceful, democratic Lebanon has been squashed with great fervour. Although promising stability and a sense of continuity to the people of Beirut, Marada militias have spent all morning rounding up possible opponents, ensuring that no one can question their regime."
leb.11.a:0 "Long Live Gemayel!"

leb.12.t:0 "A National Emergency"
leb.12.d:0 "As the sun rises over Beirut, it has become clear that the Marada movement has failed. Thrown back and actively hunted by both army and police, the remaining members have fled outside of the city in an attempt to regroup. The coup may have been averted, but it is clear that they are not finished. Most concerning is that their leader, Bachir Gemayel, has been able to escape unscathed, likely seeking refuge in the Lebanese highlands.\n\nThroughly shaken up, the cabinet gathered as soon as possible, condemning the coup in the strongest of words and declaring the state of emergency. Believing that there may still be cells remaining in Beirut itself, the ministry of the interior has decreed martial law in the entire province with support of the president."
leb.12.a:0 "We shall crush these traitors!"

leb.13.t:0 "Extraordinary Powers?"
leb.13.d:0 "With martial law in place and the Marada all but defeated, some are starting to question when the state of emergency and the extraordinary powers it has granted to our political leaders will be withdrawn. Although it has without doubt had a positive effect on the operations against the Marada, a recent article outlining corruption within the cabinet and questionable agreements between various industrialists and our leaders, misusing the situation to their advantage, has stirred up the people of Beirut. Demanding that the government lays down its powers, petitions and protests addressed at the Lebanese parliament have thus far not been answered but it's clear that the government will have to react one way or the other."
leb.13.a:0 "It's time to step back."
leb.13.b:0 "The country needs more stability..."

leb.14.t:0 "The Marada Enter the Election"
leb.14.d:0 "Named for the legendary Marada warriors of the Middle Ages, the Marada were capable fighters alongside the Volunteers' Army during the War of Liberation. With peace however, The Marada have decided to shift. They have reorganized as a small political party, centering on Lebanese nationalism and Maronite Christianity. They are now aiming for the presidency and for as many government positions as possible, but it looks like they have a long way to go."
leb.14.a:0 "They have no chances."

leb.15.t:0 "The [GetYear] Elections"
leb.15.d:0 "The time has come for the next set of elections in Lebanon, and the people are heading to the polls in a steady stream. While all parties have a chance at running, many people have written in German Architect Albert Speer for the position as a joke, though he has little shot at winning, right?

After congratulating his fellow party members over the electoral victory, Salam then opened the convention. In rapid succession, all the major goals of the party were debated, voted on, and approved.\nThese goal include female suffrage and the enfranchisement of women, the overcoming of ethnic divisions and the defence of national unity and democracy; and as a new point, the expansion of the Reform Society to the rural parts of Lebanon in order to appeal to a larger electorate and ensure that the modernisation of Lebanon isn't limited to Beirut and the coast."
leb.16.a:0 "A great goal!"

leb.17.t:0 "The National Pact"
leb.17.d:0 "The National Pact is an unwritten agreement that protects the multi-faith identity of Lebanon and helps to ensure stability within the country. Each of the major religions within Lebanon shall have their own designated posts and spheres of influence. Through the National Pact, we have made sure that every confession within Lebanon has been heard, and that no one is oppressed."
leb.17.a:0 "We will have ethnic stability!"

leb.18.t:0 "Syrian Nationalists Strike"
leb.18.d:0 "Today a group of Syrian Nationalists launched an attack on an isolated military posting, injuring several before relief could arrive and scare them away. This will surely only embolden them to do more damage in the name of their cause."

### Leader Descriptions ###

POLITICS_FARAJALLAH_EL_HELOU_DESC:0 "Farajallah Estephan el-Helou was born on June 6th, 1906, to a Maronite family in the Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate. He drifted in and out of various Lebanese public schools, eventually securing an education which landed him a teaching job at the American-run National College in Syria. Farajallah fell in with a clique of radical teachers and students at the college, which exposed him to Marxist and Syndicalist ideology. He joined fellow Lebanese radicals Fuad Shamali and Yusuf Yazbek as well as the Armenian Artin Madoyan and Syrian Khalid Bakdash in organizing the Syrian Syndicalist Party, as part of a Pan-Arabic effort to promote socialism in the Levant. Farajallah, like many other members of the party, faced heavy repression by the Ottoman authorities and spent several years in prison. In the 1930s he lived for some time abroad in the Commune of France, where he pursued further studies into Syndicalism and penned the book “A New Humanity Building a New World” about the future of Arab Socialism. Following his return to Lebanon he collaborated with Yazbek and Shamali by working for their Lebanese People’s Party, a regional branch of the Levantine Syndicalist movement, which adopted a more nationalist rhetoric to appeal to the local population."
POLITICS_KAMAL_JUMBLATT_DESC:0 "The great scion of the Jumblatt clan, Kamal Fouad was born on December 6, 1917 in Chouf, his family’s domain in Lebanese Druze territory. Kamal was the heir to an influential dynasty that had lived in Lebanon for almost half a millenia, and which had maintained a long feud with a rival Druze clan, known as the Arslan. When Kamal was four years old, his father was killed by a member of the Arslan family. Kamal’s cousin Hikmat and his mother Nazira took over leadership of the clan, training young Kamal to eventually inherit his father’s place as patriarch of the Jumblatts. Nazira was a well known liberal and feminist, who gave her son a progressive education, setting him down a path of reading western philosophy and socialist texts. Kamal attained a philosophy diploma at a prominent Christian school, the Brummana High School, and learned how to speak English as well as French and Turkish. Additionally, he made attempts to negotiate a peace with the Arslan family, in 1928 marrying Prince Shakib Arslan’s daughter, May Arslan. He thereafter travelled to the Commune of France, with the intentions of studying a wide variety of subjects in Paris’ academies, which only radicalized him further. Upon returning to Lebanon and taking his place as the head of his family, he helped to found the “Progressive Socialist Party”, as a left wing political group among the Druze."
POLITICS_SAEB_SALAM_DESC:0 "Born in Beirut, 17th of January 1905, Saeb embodies a generation of young, progressive activists who are stepping up to fill the natural power vacuum which has formed in a nation like Lebanon, who’s independence is still in its infancy. He is the son of Salim Ali Salam, a former Ottoman parliamentarian and the previous chairman of the Beirut Reform Movement. Salim was an immense force of nature in regional politics, a critic of the antiquated Sublime Porte and proponent of Lebanese independence, but also a committed reformist who believed that change was still possible within the Ottoman Empire. The failure of his father’s attempts to push the empire towards further modernisation radicalized the young Saeb, and then the flames of his political passions were fanned further by the Levantine War and the Lebanese Revolt. As the elderly Salim slowly grew frailer, he eventually retired from politics and left the leadership of the Beirut Reform Movement to his son. Saeb has been severely influenced by his father, as well as his sister, the prominen feminist Anbara Salam Khalidi (née Saeb), but most of his ideology is his own making: A combination of muslim modernism, western philosophy, secularism and economic justice, which Saeb believes can become the glue that will hold Lebanon’s divided, sectarian structure together, no matter what comes. Beside his politics, Saeb is also well known for his dandyish manners and style of dress. He is usually never seen without a flamboyantly patterned shirt and a carnation on his lapel."
POLITICS_EMIL_EDDE_DESC:0 "Emil was born on May 5th, 1886 in the city of Damascus. His family were Maronites who had worked as interpreters at the local French consulate for two generations. At an early age he moved to Beirut and became a student at a Jesuit Missionary school, before travelling to France and attaining a doctorate in law. Unlike the rest of his family, Emil was far more politically active, growing to become an ardent Lebanese nationalist and very sympathetic to Zionism. After Emil returned from France he joined Salim Ali Salam’s Beirut Reform Society, a liberal and modernist group. When at the beginning of the Weltkrieg the Ottoman Empire cracked down on Salam’s activities, Emil was forced to flee with his new comrades to Alexandria, where he supported the Entente, viewing them as potential liberators of the oppressed Lebanese people. After the end of the war, numerous members of the Reform Society were pardoned by the Ottoman government and returned home, but Emil formed a small clique which chose to remain in Alexandria, maintaining staunchly francophile and anti-Ottoman policies and refusing to partake in any political activities back in the empire. He thereafter served as an administrator under the British administration in Egypt, but after the British control over the country faltered, he opened up an office as an attorney, gaining a great deal of fame and renown in Alexandria. When Emil’s “Alexandria Clique” was eventually offered an opportunity to return to Lebanon on their own terms, he gleefully took it, returning to Beirut with celebrations and cheers, hoping to build a new, sovereign nation."
POLITICS_BECHARA_EL_KHOURY_DESC:0 "Born in the warm, Lebanese countryside town of Rechmaya, south of Beirut, Bechara el-Khoury came from an old Maronite family who had been active in regional politics for decades. He went to the Jesuit St. Joseph University in Beirut and graduated as a lawyer, whereafter he bucked the family tradition and remained decidedly aloof from partisan politics and Lebanese nationalism, at least until the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Bechara thereafter became more involved with resistance to the authoritarian governorship of Djemal Pasha and used his considerable skill and charisma to sway both Christians and Muslims to his side. Bechara’s political activities were never so forward as to merit an exile by the Ottoman Government, even as many of his Maronite comrades were forced to flee imprisonment and execution by settling in Egypt. Bechara corresponded with many of them, but also forged tighter bonds with the Lebanese Muslim community, and in recent years emerged as one of the greatestest advocates of a “unified Lebanon”, that could be governed despite its intense sectarian differences. Together with the industrialist Boutros el-Khoury, no relation, he formed the Constitutional Bloc to campaign for a peaceful cooperation with the Syrian government, as a means to attain Lebanese autonomy. When this proposed union failed, Bechara nevertheless sought to avoid war, and even after the Lebanese Rebellion remained graceful and dedicated to the concerns of the nation’s Druze and Muslim populations, hoping to quell the influence of Syrian separatists and radicals. Bechara is also known for his rather stringent attachment to power, having desired to pass numerous amendments that would increase his own and his cabinet’s influence on the country. Accusations of corruption have also been levied at him, owing to his ties to Maronite and Muslim businessmen such as his colleague Boutros and the influential Frangieh family."
POLITICS_FUAD_CHEHAB_DESC_1:0 "Fuad Abdullah Chehab was born in the Keserwan district on March 19th, 1902, but moved to live in Jounieh with his uncles at an early age. Fuad was from the Maronite branch of the prestigious Chehab dynasty, who once ruled the Emirate of Lebanon as an Ottoman vassal, but over time his family had become greatly impoverished. After the Weltkrieg he chose to enlist in the Ottoman army, hoping to secure a steady financial income. He turned out to be apt for military matters which was noticed by his superiors and he was eventually recommended to an officer school in Aleppo, during a period of political thaw in the Ottoman military. During this time Chehab became more intimate with liberal and reformists ideas, initially being an admirer of Mustafa Kemal after studying the general turned Grand Vizier’s innovative approach to both military and political matters. In a few years time however, Chehab gradually grew more radical, associating with various progressive and republican groups, as well as corresponding with key nationalist figures back in his home of Lebanon. After graduating with top marks, Chehab remained posted in Syria and oversaw garrison duties out on the frontier, but his Christian faith prevented him from attaining any higher military position. This was one of the reasons why Chehab’s sympathies for the nationalist movements in Lebanon and Syria only grew. Like many of his former classmates in Aleppo, he defected to join the Syrian revolt, serving as both a vital strategic mastermind and an effective figurehead for rallying the Lebanese Maronites to fight for their freedom.\nIn the aftermath of the Lebanese Declaration of Independence, Chehab has been appointed as the nation’s provisional president, owing to his influential ties within both military and political circles. Although regarded as something of a reluctant leader, Chehab has still been able to fulfil the role he’s been given, bringing much needed order to Beirut. Some have expressed worry about Chehab’s strong armed measures though, fearing that the General’s rather apolitical vision for the Lebanese Revolution, which puts national stability firmly before partisan politics, could potentially hamper the future development of a multiparty democracy."
POLITICS_FUAD_CHEHAB_DESC_2:0 "Fuad Abdullah Chehab was born in the Keserwan district on March 19th, 1902, but moved to live in Jounieh with his uncles at an early age. Fuad was from the Maronite branch of the prestigious Chehab dynasty, who once ruled the Emirate of Lebanon as an Ottoman vassal, but over time his family had become greatly impoverished.

Like many of his former classmates in Aleppo, he defected to join the Syrian revolt, serving as both a vital strategic mastermind and an effective figurehead for rallying the Lebanese Maronites to fight for their freedom.\nAfter refusing to surrender his emergency powers as provisional president, and now having consolidated his hold on the state, following a series of failed violent insurrections by both Maronite extremists and Arab nationalists, Fuad Chehab has assumed the role of a guardian of Lebanon’s democratic future. Despite wide-spread condemnation by the parliament, he has derided the Lebanese political parties as being far too concerned with their own partisan issues and putting personal grudges ahead of the nation’s interests. It remains to be seen if Lebanon’s new great helmsman can steer the nation away from corrupt political scheming, familial oligarchies and radical populism, having promised that once these faults of the political system have been excised, a true Lebanese democracy will flourish under the legacy of Chehabism."
POLITICS_ANTOINE_PETER_ARIDA_DESC:0 "Patriarchatus Antonius the Second is a man of many names, although most commonly known by his title of Antonius Petros, or in Arabic as Antoine Boutros and in English as Anthony Peter. He was born on the 2nd of February, 1863 with the name Selim Ben Abdel Ahad Arida. He learned Arabic and Syriac as a schoolboy. From 1884 to 1890 he studied theology at the school of Saint-Sulpice, Paris and after returning to Lebanon was later ordained a Maronite priest in 1890. Later, he was made the Maronite bishop of Tripoli in 1908 by then Patriarch of Antioch, Elias Peter Hoayek. Hoayek was known as a colossal force in Lebanese politics, and commonly regarded as the “Father of Maronite Nationalism”. This left Arida with big shoes to fill when in 1931, the Maronite Church elected him Patriarch, receiving the Pope’s blessing shortly after. Arida took on the traditional name of Peter and the regnal name of Anthony the Second, beginning to guide the Church down a somewhat more liberal path than his die-hard predecessor. Notably, he began cooperating with other Eastern Catholic sects who remained in Lebanon, to consolidate Christian influence behind the Maronites, giving autonomy to Jesuits and Coptics in exchange for their political support. Arida is also known as a great architect and philanthropist for his work in renovating the estates of the Bishopric of Tripoli, as well as the Patriarch’s summer residence in Diman, which he personally funded with the help of his brother. Additionally, during his rule as Patriarch he has overseen the expansion of numerous monstestaries and the establishment of church owned silk and cement factories to help finance these religious communities."
POLITICS_CHARLES_HELOU_DESC:0 "Few had expected Charles Alexandre Hélou, a former member of the Marada Movement, to become Fuad Chehab’s successor. Born in Beirut on the 25th of September, 1913 to an influential Maronite family from the Mount Lebanon Mutasufarriate’s capital of Baabda. His family connections not only allowed him into prominent European run schools, but also introduced him to the social circles of the Lebanese Independence movement. Helou emerged as something of an apolitical weathervane, moving smoothly between different political cliques and factions, as ideological trends changed around him. He has at various times been affiliated with Michael Chiha, Petro Trad, the Maronite clergy, Pierre Gemayel and now Fuad Chehab. Helou joined the Marada Movement seemingly on a whim, but grew alienated by their choice to adopt violence methods. He eventually turned out to be more the right material for a diplomat than a fighter, catching General Chehab’s eye after he was one of the men sent by the Marada to negotiate their integration into the Provisional Government and Lebanese Volunteer Army. Chehab took the easily influenced Helou under his wing, encouraging him to join the Provisional Government as an independent minister, like many other of Chehab’s followers. Helou’s lack of political guile and his admiration for Chehab left him as the perfect choice as a successor once Chehab’s term ran out, despite Helou’s previous affiliation with the Marada. After a heavily controlled election he has now become a civilian face for the enduring military administration. "
POLITICS_ALBERT_SPEER_DESC:0 "Born thousands of miles away in Mannheim, Germany, none could have ever predicted the great architect Albert Speer would win the recent Lebanese elections. However, fate works in mysterious ways and after a joke write-in campaign during the recent national race got out of hand, this Kraut has somehow come out on top, becoming President of Lebanon. Stranger still, it appears as though President Speer does not know if this historic win himself, still residing at his estate in the Kaiserreich working at his architecture firm. How he still is in the dark on this development is not known, but in his absence, a cabinet has been assembled to run the nation in his stead. Eagerly we shall await our rightful ruler to arrive to lead the way for our new state, but with each passing day, the likelihood of his arrival draws more dim."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_GERMAN_BUSCH_DESC:0 "Germán Busch Becerra was born in 1904, however, his place of birth is currently unknown as he has not been open about it with his colleagues and associates. He entered the 'Colegio Militar de la Nación' in 1922, where he graduated in 1927 as second lieutenant, and steadily rose through the ranks until becoming captain just before the Chaco War. During the Chaco War, he was awarded several times for bravery and is seen as a Bolivian war hero. With the defeat at the Chaco War, Busch allied himself with David Toro, and both couped the liberal government by Salamanca in 1934 with huge support from the army and the populace in general. Since then, Busch has been pushing reforms that have slowly but steadily improved the Bolivian situation, and the general populace holds him in high regard. However, Busch was never prepared to be a politician, and it remains unclear if he'd like to continue as President, or will finally call for elections once the situation normalizes."
POLITICS_VICTOR_PAZ_DESC:0 "Víctor Ángel Paz Estenssoro was born in 1907 in the town of Tarija, Bolivia. Víctor wanted to study civil engineering, but since that career wasn't available in Bolivian universities, he ended up choosing to study law at the 'Universidad Mayor de San Andrés', where he graduated as a lawyer in 1927, with just twenty years. During the Chaco War, Paz enlisted in the army, reaching the rank of sergeant a few months after having volunteered. During the war, he read the 'ABC of Communism' by Bukharin and the 'The Burning Question of Trade Unionism' by De Leon, which influenced Víctor towards syndicalist-leaning ideals. When the war ended, Paz served as a lawyer for a year for 'Patiño Mines', owned by the Tin King Patiño himself, where he witnessed the extent of the mining companies influence in Bolivian affairs. Outraged, he resigned and formed the 'Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario', trying to rally political moderates that wish to end the corrupt influence that private companies exercise on Bolivia's government. Now that he has managed to become President, Víctor will strive to bring about a land reform, nationalisation of key industries and better working conditions for all Bolivians."
POLITICS_ARZE_ARZE_DESC:0 "José Antonio Arze y Arze was born in 1904 in Cochabamba, Bolivia. He graduated as a lawyer from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Simón' in 1926, and then joined the 'Federación Universitaria Boliviana', where he began to be influenced by the Syndicalist ideals within the organisation. Arze y Arze, with other intellectuals of the organisation like Ricardo Anaya and Jose Cuadros Quiroga created the 'Programa de Principios', in which they stipulated that Bolivia had to nationalize the mining and oil industries, provide land for natives to work and enforce stronger work laws. However, José's radical anti-war posture forced him to leave for Chile when the Chaco War came about. He returned at the end of the war, and formed the 'Partido de la Izquierda Revolucionaria', gathering support from the exploited miners in the poorer areas of Bolivia. Now that Arze y Arze has managed to become President, he'll enact the 'Programa de Principios' and carry on further reforms to transform Bolivia into a revolutionary country."
POLITICS_BILBAO_RIOJA_BOL_HOS_DESC:0 "Bernardino Bilbao Rioja was born in 1895 in the small county of Arampampa, Potosí province, Bolivia. Bernardino entered the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' when he was 17, earning a scholarship for the Military Academy in Chile, where he graduated as an Infantry second lieutenant in 1918, and became a pilot in 1919. In 1926, already with the rank of Major, he founded the 'Escuela de Aviación de Bolivia', becoming a pioneer in Bolivian aviation. He became a national hero during the Chaco war, standing out for his bravery and excellent organisation skills. However, the defeat against the Paraguayans have drastically changed Bilbao Rojas political stance, leading him to form the Partido Nacionalista Boliviano. Now that he's in power, he'll try to centralize power under himself and reinforce the army with the goal of reclaiming Bolivia's lost glory, whatever the cost may be."
POLITICS_ENRIQUE_CASTILLO_HOS_DESC:0 "Enrique Peñaranda del Castillo was born in 1892 in the Bolivian capital, La Paz. He graduated from the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' as a second-lieutenant in 1910, reaching the rank of colonel by 1932. A decorated veteran of the Chaco War, Peñarada will try to improve the living conditions of Bolivian citizens and to live up to the expectations his party has set out to accomplish with patriotic enthusiasm."
POLITICS_MAMERTO_URRIO_DESC:0 "Mamerto Urriolagoitia Harriague was born in 1895 in Sucre, Bolivia. He graduated from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Francisco Xavier' as a lawyer in 1916, joining the PUR during his time in college. In 1917 he was sent to London and later to Canada as the Bolivian ambassador. He returned in 1937 and had occupied the role of senator before the elections. Urrutio is bound to continue the PUR's policies, keep a close contact with the Catholic church in order to secure his legitimacy and try to attract foreign investment."
POLITICS_THE_KINGTIN_DESC:0 "Simón Iturri Patiño, better known as the 'Tin King', was born in 1860 in the small town of Santibáñez, Cochabamba province, Bolivia. He began working as an administrator in the 'Compañia Minera Huanchaca', then moving on to a trading company and finally working as a miner in Huanchaca. He discovered an extremely rich vein of tin in 1900, forming his own mining company to exploit it, and with the profits, he began buying over his competition. By 1924, Patiño had already bought foundries in Canada and Germany, forming the 'Patiño Mines and Enterprises Consolidated Inc.'. He has used his vast wealth to influence Bolivian public affairs since 1929, using the Partido Liberal Popular as a façade to pass his reforms. Now that he's in power, the Tin King will make sure to run Bolivia as he runs his corporation, focusing on efficiency and profits rather than individuals."
POLITICS_CARLOS_QUIROGA_DESC:0 "Carlos Quintanilla Quiroga was born in 1888 in Cochabamba, Bolivia. He graduated as Bachelor of Science and Literature from the 'Universidad de San Simon de Cochabamba' in 1903 and would enter the Military Academy right after, graduating as a second-lieutenant in 1907. A Chaco War veteran, he has been designated military governor of Bolivia. While he is respected inside the army, it remains to be seen if he can effectively pacify Bolivia and bring it back from the brink of collapse."
POLITICS_ALCIDES_ARGUEDAS_DESC:0 "Alcides Arguedas Díaz was born in the Bolivian capital, La Paz. He began studying law and political science in the 'Universidad Mayor de San Andrés' in 1904, and would later move to Paris to study sociology. On his return to Bolivia, he joined the Partido Liberal, where he climbed through the party ranks until being chosen as deputy in 1916 and ambassador to Colombia in 1929, where he was fired for criticizing President Hernando Siles, and his criticism of the following governments led him to be exiled and even slapped by President Busch-Becerra in 1936. Thanks to the Partido Liberal Popular's influence, he was able to return to Bolivia for the 1940's election. He is a prolific writer, making several books and essays regarding the harsh Bolivian reality, and now that he has become President, he'll try to liberalize the inefficient Bolivian bureaucracy and help the common citizen have a better standard of living. However, the mining companies hold great influence on his party, and he may be forced to make concessions to said companies..."
POLITICS_ENRIQUE_HERTZOG_DESC:0 "José Enrique Hertzog Garaizábal was born in the Bolivian capital, La Paz. He graduated as a physician from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Andres' in 1921. He joined the 'Partido Genuino Republicano', led by Daniel Salamanca, and rose through the ranks until becoming War Minister during the Chaco War. When Salamanca's government was overthrown by Busch Becerra, Hertzog founded his own party, the 'Partido de la Unión Republicana', from which he has managed to gain the support Salamanca used to have before being overthrown. Now that Hertzog is President, he'll try to revert back the policies that Busch Becerra made to the unpopular policies Salamanca tried, and try to improve the Bolivian situation from there."
POLITICS_SIMON_PATINO_DESC:0 "Simón Iturri Patiño, better known as the 'Tin King', was born in 1860 in the small town of Santibáñez, Cochabamba province, Bolivia. He began working as an administrator in the 'Compañia Minera Huanchaca', then moving on to a trading company and finally working as a miner in Huanchaca.

Now that he's in power, the Tin King will make sure to run Bolivia as he runs his corporation, focusing on efficiency and profits rather than individuals."
POLITICS_MAMERTO_URRIOLAGOITIA_DESC:0 "Mamerto Urriolagoitia Harriague was born in 1895 in Sucre, Bolivia. He graduated from the 'Universidad Mayor de San Francisco Xavier' as a lawyer in 1916, joining the PUR during his time in college. In 1917 he was sent to London and later to Canada as the Bolivian ambassador. He returned in 1937 and had occupied the role of senator before the elections. Urrutio is bound to continue the PUR's policies, keep a close contact with the Catholic church in order to secure his legitimacy and try to attract foreign investment."
POLITICS_GRANADO_Y_GRANADO_DESC:0 "Francisco Javier del Granado y Granado was born in 1913, in Arani, Cochabamba province, Bolivia. Despite his young age, Javier has managed to become a very popular figure among the Bolivian populace as a poet, and his political allegiance with the MNR has made its party's popularity skyrocket. Now that Francisco has managed to become President of Bolivia, he'll try to combine the revolutionary nationalism that characterizes the MNR with his profound faith towards Catholicism in order to bring about new reforms to improve the Bolivian citizens’ livelihood."
POLITICS_ENRIQUE_CATILLO_DESC:0 "Enrique Peñaranda del Castillo was born in 1892 in the Bolivian capital, La Paz. He graduated from the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' as a second-lieutenant in 1910, reaching the rank of colonel by 1932. A decorated veteran of the Chaco War, Peñarada will try to improve the living conditions of Bolivian citizens and to live up to the expectations his party has set out to accomplish with patriotic enthusiasm."
POLITICS_HERNAN_ZUAZO_DESC:0 "Hernán Siles Zuazo was born in 1913 in the Bolivian capital, La Paz. Hernan volunteered during the Chaco War despite suffering sharp Myopia, where he was wounded and given the 'Cruz de Guerra' medal. He graduated as a lawyer in 1939 and joined the MNR, where he has managed to become one of the most influential figures. During his Presidential Inauguration, Hernán has claimed 'I shall be a Head of State who shall never resort to violence to sustain myself. I shall not rely on other forces than the ones that the people have given me and whom I shall serve for the rest of my life if necessary'. However, with internal rivalries rising within the MNR, it remains to be seen if Zuazo will be able to stay true to his word."

### Focuses ###
BOL_Centralise_Mining_Operations:0 "Centralise Mining Operations"
BOL_Centralise_Mining_Operations_desc:0 "Our main mining operations have been controlled for too long by the so-called 'Tin Barons'. If we want to improve our economic situation, we need to start nationalizing mining corporations in order to take away their power, and more importantly, their profits."
BOL_Increased_Government_Interference:0 "Increased Government Interference"
BOL_Increased_Government_Interference_desc:0 "We can't trust private businesses to watch over the welfare of our workers and the stability of our economy. We need to enact restrictions and regulations in order to keep them in line with our interests."
BOL_Agricultural_Subsidies:0 "Agricultural Subsidies"
BOL_Agricultural_Subsidies_desc:0 "Our farmers have been struggling to survive ever since our defeat in the Chaco War. It's our duty as these people's rulers to subsidize their products and livelihood if we ever hope to gain their support after such a blunder."
BOL_Connecting_the_Nation:0 "Connecting the Nation"
BOL_Connecting_the_Nation_desc:0 "While we have plenty of railroads within Bolivia, they've been mostly built by mining corporations looking to make profit in one of the many mines in Bolivia. Many of our towns and villages stand isolated, making the transport of products back and forth from the Capital an expensive endeavour. As such, we have decided to extend the railways, so that we can carry products to our citizens faster and cheaper than before."
BOL_Bail_Out_Industry:0 "Bail out Industry"
BOL_Bail_Out_Industry_desc:0 "Now that we have acquired a budget surplus, thanks to our nationalisation efforts, we need to start looking out for our loyal industries.

BOL_Tax_Breaks:0 "Tax Breaks"
BOL_Tax_Breaks_desc:0 "Bolivia's last liberal government was Jose Gutierre Guerra's back in 1920. If we hope to ever go back to the good old days we had with them, we have to start making tax breaks in order to encourage new businesses to be opened in Bolivia, and by extension, bring us some much needed economic prosperity."
BOL_Loosen_Regulation:0 "Loosen Regulation"
BOL_Loosen_Regulation_desc:0 "Bolivia's economic regulations seemed reasonable back in the day when the unions first appeared and we needed something to appease them. However, this has only made us lag behind our competitors! We need to loosen these regulations in order to help new businesses to settle more easily."
BOL_Selling_Out_for_Funding:0 "Placate the Oligarchs"
BOL_Selling_Out_for_Funding_desc:0 "Local Oligarchs are concerned we might be selling out our country to foreigners who have no love for Bolivia, unlike them. We shall give them a few benefits against their competition, before they start antagonizing our regime."
BOL_Longer_Hours_Lower_Pay:0 "Longer Hours, Lower Pay"
BOL_Longer_Hours_Lower_Pay_desc:0 "While our government has always watched out for its citizens, our current work laws might be a little too much. We need to reduce the minimum wage and extend the 8-hour work week to a 10-hour work week"
BOL_Capitalism_forever:0 "Encourage Capitalists"
BOL_Capitalism_forever_desc:0 "Tax Exemptions, cheap and hardworking employees and very few regulations are the way forward for Bolivia if we want to encourage capitalists magnates to set their businesses on our country and, as a consequence, increase our profits from their activities."

BOL_Middle_Way:0 "Strive for an Equilibrium"
BOL_Middle_Way_desc:0 "While both statists and liberals have been right in the past, both have also been wrong many times. With that in mind, we should strive for a balance between encouraging new businesses to be settled in our country as well as having space for our own industries to thrive."
BOL_Diversify_the_Economy:0 "Diversify the Economy"
BOL_Diversify_the_Economy_desc:0 "Bolivia's economic woes have always been related to our overdependence on our mining industry.

That's the path we'll choose for our future."
BOL_Fostering_Entrepeneurship:0 "Fostering Entrepreneurship"
BOL_Fostering_Entrepeneurship_desc:0 "If we are to proclaim ourselves free from foreign capitalist vultures, we need to start fostering our own breed of entrepreneurs who will watch over Bolivia's prosperity from the private sectors.

BOL_Heavy_Industry:0 "Heavy Industry"
BOL_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "While our country has many valuable industrial resources like Tin, we have no heavy industries that might take advantage of them.

If we hope to break this cycle that has led Bolivia to be a backwater country, we need to encourage the settling and creation of heavy industries here."
BOL_Domestic_Arms_Industry:0 "Domestic Arms Industry"
BOL_Domestic_Arms_Industry_desc:0 "Ever since our country's creation, we have depended on foreign weapons to equip our armies. While this has spared us the investment in the weapons industry back during peacetime, it has backfired spectacularly for our budgets during wartime. Provided this, we should found our own arms industry, even if that means we'll end up producing foreign licences in the future."
BOL_Increased_Resource_Extraction:0 "Increased Resource Extraction"
BOL_Increased_Resource_Extraction_desc:0 "Our economic boon has always been the resources that lay within our great nation.

BOL_Arms_for_Tin:0 "Arms for Tin"
BOL_Arms_for_Tin_desc:0 "In the past, Bolivia could acquire great amounts of equipment by exchanging silver for arms. Today, the world has changed, but not our ideas.

BOL_Universitary_Funding:0 "Universitary Funding"
BOL_Universitary_Funding_desc:0 "While our universities do their best in order to provide us with the best professionals they can, Bolivia is a vast country with endless potential, and slowly but steadily, we have been forced to hire foreign professionals in order to fill the administrative gaps. We need to increase our funding to our universities with the goal of replacing these foreigners for our local talent."

BOL_The_Times_They_Are_A_Changing_desc:0 "Bolivia has a long way to go before finally recovering from the crisis we have suffered.

BOL_Fresh_Blood:0 "Doctrinal Innovation"

BOL_Never_Again:0 "Subordinación y Constancia"
BOL_Never_Again_desc:0 "'Subordination and perseverance' is the motto of the Bolivian armed forces. It demands that our soldiers be not only loyal to their commanders and to Bolivia, but to be humble in the face of victory, patient in a stalemate and persevering in defeat. We shall try to enforce these ideals with improved drills and training, that shall provides us with the most powerful army in South America!"
BOL_Legacy_of_the_Chaco:0 "Legacy of the Chaco"

### Events ###
bol.1.t:0 "Introduction to Bolivia"
bol.1.d:0 "Since her formation, Bolivia has not fared well in terms of her foreign policy, suffering many painful losses. A border conflict with Chile led to the 'Saltpetre War' (1879 – 1883), where Bolivia lost despite an alliance with Peru, and ended with the nation being forced to cede the coastal province of Antofagasta, losing its access to the sea. Later, In 1903, Brazil and Bolivia signed the Treaty of Petróplis, ceding the important rubber producing province Acre to Brazil in a shameful agreement that still angers Bolivians to this day.\n\nWhile Bolivia's mining wealth increased over the years, so did the influence of mining companies in the government, and their capacity to influence policy. Then the Chaco War happened, where despite fleeting glory in a few victories that prolonged the war, Bolivia was defeated thoroughly, and Paraguay only sued for peace at Brazil's and Peru's request, both fearing a full collapse of the Bolivian state. The apocalyptic defeat at the hands of Paraguay was more than a crushing blow to Bolivian national pride, it was also a severe blow for Bolivian democracy and economy as most of the population now believes that the Chaco War was the doing of said mining corporations meddling in public affairs\n\nConsidering Bolivia's status as instigator of the war in the disputed territory, the punishment was severe: the Chaco to the east of the Parapeti river, north of the Pilcomayo and east of the Andes was to be ceded to Paraguay in its entirety and in perpetuity; its oil wealth forever in foreign hands.\n\nThe corrupt civilian government was quickly blamed for the humiliation, as many generals and officers publicly decrying interference from the president Daniel Salamanca and his liberal allies. Germán Busch and David Toro, two decorated war heroes, couped the government in early 1934 and established a ''Government of National Salvation'' with a broad base of support, but no defined ideology other than seeing the needs of the army met, adjusting the fiscal mess left by the war and attempting to improve the situation of the poor in the cities. Even though Germán made extensive changes to the constitution, the situation remains as desperate as ever and it will not take much for the Bolivian economy to collapse should Tin prices plummet even further. Despite all this, Bolivians still look outwards, remembering the old glory days and await anxiously for the day that justice is made and Chaco and a coastline are returned to them!"

bol.202.t:0 "A Syndicalist Republic?"
bol.202.d:0 "Surprising much of the Bolivian establishment, the Syndicalists have not only achieved victory in the elections but have done so with a far greater margin than expected. As many of the leading industrialists and corrupt elite fear for their safety, the struggle is far from over as the revanchist PNB is contesting the results and has even taken up arms in a few of the outer regions."
bol.202.a:0 "We restore Bolivia to its former glory!"
bol.202.b:0 "Democracy must be respected!"

bol.301.t:0 "The King Becomes President"
bol.301.d:0 "Known as the Tin King or Rey del Estaño both in Bolivia and abroad, Simón Patiño has now not only a near monopolistic grip on the tin trade but also on the Bolivian government. Working up his way from poverty during much of his youth to the incomprehensible fortune only a few decades later, the story of Patiño is known to many Bolivians which has led to a plethora of both admirers and critics who would rather see him fail his office than continue expanding his power."
bol.301.a:0 "A Fait Accompli."

bol.5.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the Nation"
bol.5.d:0 "The shockwaves of the global economic disaster have reached our markets with an immediate hit to the mining industry. Prices for the simplest of commodities are sharply rising and layoffs at the enterprises run by the Mining Oligarchs have already started."
bol.5.a:0 "It never ends!"

bol.6.t:0 "Yearly War Reparations to Paraguay"
bol.6.d:0 "After our horrendous defeat at the hands of Paraguay in the Chaco war, we not only lost our dignity and petroleum rich land but were also forced to pay the Paraguayans war reparations. These massive sums of money and goods have put a heavy strain on our economy and are making any recovery nigh impossible."
bol.6.a:0 "We have no choice..."

bol.7.t:0 "Lake Titicaca Maneuvers"
bol.7.d:0 "Created with a lavish opening ceremony, President [BOL.GetLeader] has announced the creation of the Fuerza Naval Boliviana. Consisting of 4 patrol boats and over 1500 members of the Bolivian land forces, our fleet is the pride of the nation and a testament to our lost territories on the Pacific Coast.\n\nWhile some have raised concerns, asking whether this is really the best use of our taxes, the majority of our military sees this as a political statement desperately needed in these trying times to raise morale."
bol.7.a:0 "We have a dream...!"

#Strikes
bol.8.t:0 "Tin Prices Collapse!"
bol.8.d:0 "As the Black Monday disaster takes the world in its grip, imports of Tin by the German sphere have fallen catastrophically bringing the price of the resource down with them. Being one of the key motors of our economy and already suffering from a recession in the last few years, the sector is torn into disarray with mining companies unsure how to proceed and mining jobs becoming less secure by the day."
bol.8.a:0 "Oh no!"

bol.9.t:0 "Strike in the Tin Mines"
bol.9.d:0 "As tin profits remain in freefall and the nation descends into the greatest depression of its history, miners from the Siglo XX and Catavi mines in the Potosi province have approached their management demanding better conditions. Refusal by the Corporación Minera de Bolivia has prompted a strike by the miners who have laid down all work and are urging the other mines to stand with them against injustice."
bol.9.a:0 "We must take decisive action!"
bol.9.b:0 "The miners are right! Down with the Barons!"

bol.10.t:0 "Massacre at Catavi"
bol.10.d:0 "In response to the strike at Catavi, Busch ordered the military to move in and solve the matter. 7000 miners who participated in the strike were marching towards the management offices when the army surrounded the group and ordered them to stand down and return to work.\n\nRefusal by the miners to do so resulted in the military opening fire on the crowds. For over 6 hours the army continued shooting at the mass, resulting in hundreds of wounded and according to state media 19 deaths. The organisers of the strike however claim that over 400 miners were killed in the incident and are outraged by the incident."
bol.10.a:0 "A job well done."
bol.10.b:0 "Find the ones responsible!"

bol.11.t:0 "Further Strikes at the Huanuni Mines"
bol.11.d:0 "Even though the break up of the Catavi strike caused hundreds of casualties, the miners of Huanuni have still dared to stand up to the army and are repeating the demands of their dead brethren. Likely inspired by the successes of the syndicalist movement in Patagonia and Chile, the miners don't seem afraid to defend their rights and are openly questioning the government and companies they work for."
bol.11.a:0 "Break the strikes up with military force!"

bol.12.t:0 "MNR Endorses the Strike!"
bol.12.d:0 "Carefully observing the escalating situation at Catavi, the MNR has officially issued a statement today expressing their full support for the strikers and joining their call for better living conditions and higher pay."
bol.12.a:0 "An escalating matter."

bol.13.t:0 "PSB Endorses the Strike!"
bol.13.d:0 "A surprise to no one, the Syndicalist party has condemned the mining oligarchs and has called up all miners in the tin industry to strike as well. Hailing the success of the revolution in Chile, the party hopes that the Bolivian miners will also successfully throw off their yokes and receive better working and living conditions."
bol.13.a:0 "An escalating matter."

bol.14.t:0 "Huanuni Mine Joins the Strike"
bol.14.d:0 "As the strikes at Catavi keep escalating with no end in sight, the miners of the Huanuni mine have also laid down the work and have announced their support for their brethren at Catavi and Siglo XX. MNR and PSB politicians immediately replied by endorsing the action and encouraging the other tin mines to support the movement."
bol.14.a:0 "We are losing control over the situation!"

bol.15.t:0 "Unrest in Oruro!"
bol.15.d:0 "With workers all across the sector laying down work, those of the La Salvadora tin mine have now also joined the movement. These miners, predominantly from the city of Oruro, have set up camp in front of the Tin Kings (Simón Iturri Patiño) house echoing the demands for higher pay and safer working conditions."
bol.15.a:0 "This has gone far enough! Send in the Army!"
bol.15.b:0 "We should seek assistance abroad!"

bol.16.t:0 "Recreate the Peru-Bolivian Confederation?"
bol.16.d:0 "The Confederation between our two nations was a shortlived state between 1836–1839 based on the idea that the two nations would be stronger together and prove a serious opponent to the other power blocs. A catastrophic defeat at the hands of Chile and Argentina in the War of the Confederation broke the Union apart and recreated the two independent nations.\n\nNevertheless support for the Union in both nations remains at large to this day and has even gained popularity due to the failures of the Chaco war and the downspiralling economy. Incapacity by Busch to solve the strikers issue has reopened the case and serious proposals from various members of cabinet in favour of the Union are being presented."
bol.16.a:0 "We can handle this on our own! Send in the Army!"
bol.16.b:0 "Propose the idea to Peru."

bol.17.t:0 "Bolivia Offers to Recreate the Peru-Bolivian Confederation"
bol.17.d:0 "The Confederation between our two nations was a short lived state between 1836–1839 based on the idea that the two nations would be stronger together and prove a serious opponent to the other power blocks. A catastrophic defeat at the hands of Chile and Argentina in the War of the Confederation broke the Union apart and recreated the two independent nations.\n\nNevertheless support for the Union in both nations remains at large to this day and has even gained popularity in Bolivia due to the failures of the Chaco war and the downspiralling economy. Incapacity by Busch to solve the Labour issues troubling his nation and strong pushes from the other parties have forced him to propose a reinstatement of the Confederation to help prevent Bolivia from further tumbling into chaos."
bol.17.a:0 "Ratify the Reunification!"
bol.17.b:0 "We don't want Bolivia dragging us down."

bol.18.t:0 "Tin Strikes Defused"
bol.18.d:0 "As the streets run red with the blood of miners and the leadership behind the strikes is either dead or imprisoned, the strikes have lost their momentum and the workers have been forced to return to work. While the socialist parties have grown stronger in the wake of this crisis, it seems unlikely that they will break the might of the military any time soon."
bol.18.a:0 "Stability...for now."

bol.19.t:0 "An Opportunity?"
bol.19.d:0 "As Paraguay is embroiled in yet another war, this situation has created an opportunity for us to cancel our war reparations to them and start rebuilding our own armed forces. Direct intervention from Paraguay could follow shortly however and we should prepare ourselves before taking drastic action."
bol.19.a:0 "Cancel the payments!"
bol.19.b:0 "We aren't ready for this."

bol.20.t:0 "Bolivia Refuses to Continue the War Reparations!"
bol.20.d:0 "Sensing an opportunity due to our involvement elsewhere, the Bolivians have decided to stop all payments and have expelled our officials stationed in their nation to avoid their military from building up."
bol.20.a:0 "This means war!"
bol.20.b:0 "We aren't prepared for another war."

bol.21.t:0 "The Tin King Returns Home!"
bol.21.d:0 "Simon Iturri Patiño, better known as the Tin King, is one of the wealthiest people in the world and the owner of many of our tin mines and mining companies, with his influence even reaching foundries in Canada and Germany. With the Chaco war and the near collapse of Bolivia, he left for the US in order to protect himself from the fallout. However, now that the situation has greatly deteriorated in the US, he has returned to Bolivia once more."
bol.21.a:0 "Now he returns?"

bol.22.t:0 "The Weltkrieg Reaches South America!"
bol.22.d:0 "Initiated by the European conflict between the syndicalist Internationale and the German led Reichspakt, their struggle has reached our continent as well prompting another war in the Southern Cone. This has given us the opportunity to reclaim our lost territories in Paraguay and Chile and should be seized immediately!"
bol.22.a:0 "Attack Paraguay!"
bol.22.b:0 "Attack Chile!"
bol.22.c:0 "Attack Chile and Paraguay!"
bol.22.e:0 "Remain neutral."

bol.23.t:0 "The Future of Bolivia"
bol.23.d:0 "Germán Busch Becerra has ruled Bolivia for three years now, and his rule is illegitimate at best, as he had to coup Daniel Salamanca in 1934 in order to become president. However, many in the country still support Busch, and his reforms have done nothing but improve Bolivian livelihood and stability. While Busch Becerra respects the democratic process, he has shown willingness to stay in his role as president permanently. Should we call for elections? Or rewrite our constitution for him to become president for life?"
bol.23.a:0 "Long live El Presidente!"
bol.23.b:0 "The elections should be fair for all."

bol.24.t:0 "Mounting Pressure for Elections!"
bol.24.d:0 "As the elections approach in Bolivia, some of our most trusted advisers have indicated that we may no longer have the majority and that the reign of Germán Busch may have reached its end. Luckily we have near total control over the elections and as such we have given the order to replace some of the boxes with our own."
bol.24.a:0 "Nothing a little rigging can't fix."

bol.25.t:0 "Mounting Pressure for Elections!"
bol.25.d:0 "As the elections approach in Bolivia, some of our most trusted advisers have indicated that we may no longer have the majority and that the reign of Germán Busch may have reached its end. Luckily we have near total control over the elections and as such we have given the order to replace some of the boxes with our own."
bol.25.a:0 "Long Live El Presidente!"

bol.26.t:0 "Radical Coup Attempt!"
bol.26.d:0 "Inspired by the repeated failures by the Busch administration, several members of the military have launched a strike at La Paz to dethrone Busch and instate their own administration. Clamoring for the return of Bolivia's rightful territories and the return of Bolivian greatness, the movement is quickly picking up steam especially amongst the lower classes and in the mines where workers discontent with the status quo are desperately looking for a way out."
bol.26.a:0 "The coup succeeds!"
bol.26.b:0 "Busch reasserts control."

bol.27.t:0 "Bolivia Wants to Join the Internationale"
bol.27.d:0 "The small South American nation of Bolivia has officially requested our permission to join the Internationale and aid our efforts in securing the liberation of the worker class everywhere in the world."
bol.27.a:0 "Huzzah!"
bol.27.b:0 "Aren't those the guys that lost to Paraguay?"

##Army Generals##

BOL_German_Busch_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 23, 1904, birthplace unknown.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Germán Busch Becerra entered the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito in 1922, and graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1927. He was promoted to Lieutenant right before the Chaco War. He took part in the Battle of Boqueron, where he was forced to retreat after failing to relieve the garrison at fort Boqueron in one of the bloodiest battles of the Chaco War. Despite this, he was promoted to Captain of the 5th Cavalry regiment, where he was decorated for his bravery with the 'Orden del Condor de los Andes' medal. He'd later join other disgruntled army generals and overthrow the Salamanca government, dedicating to politics since then. Despite becoming a Bolivian national hero, the Chaco war has left Germán emotionally scarred, with sources close to his family revealing that he's dealing with a severe case of depression.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Leader of the Junta de Salvación Nacional."
BOL_Angel_Ayora_desc:0 ""
BOL_Bernardino_Bilbao_Rioja_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 20, 1895, in Arampampa, Potosí Province, Bolivia.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Bernardino Bilbao Rioja joined the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' in 1912, where he was given a scholarship and sent to the Chilean officer school. He would go onto graduate as an artillery second-lieutenant in 1918 and also received training as a Pilot in 1919. By 1926 he reached the rank of Major and went onto creating and organising the 'Escuela Militar de Aviación', becoming a flight instructor as well as becoming one of the pioneers of Bolivian aviation. In 1932, he was sent as part of a military attaché to Argentina but was quickly recalled as soon as the Chaco War began. When he arrived back he was named General Inspector of the Bolivian Air Force and military transportation. He took part in the fierce battles at Cañada Strongest, Kilómetro Siete, the retaking of Alihuatá and the defence of Vallamontes, where he stood out for his bravery and excellent organisation skills.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- After travelling through Europe, he now leads the ultranationalist Partido Nacional Boliviano."
BOL_Gualberto_Villarroel_Lopez_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 15, 1908, in Villa Rivero, Cochabamba Province, Bolivia.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Gualberto Villarroel López joined the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito', where he graduated in 1930 as a second lieutenant. From his graduation, López steadily rose through the ranks until the start of the Chaco War, where his cunning and bravery transformed him into a War hero for the Bolivian people.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Member of the Junta de Salvación Nacional."
BOL_Carlos_Quintanilla_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 22, 1888, in Cochabamba, Bolivia.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Carlos Quintanilla Quiroga graduated from the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' as a second-lieutenant in 1907. He was sent to Germany as a military attaché during the Weltkrieg, undertaking several military courses in the German Kriegsakademie. He'd return to Bolivia and reach the rank of commander before the outbreak of the Chaco War where he became Chief of Staff after Filiberto Osorio's resignation. However, Quintanilla would eventually be responsible for the Bolivian defeat at the Battle of Boquerón, in which he ignored signs of an imminent Paraguayan attack as well as failing to make any significant strategic decisions that could've turned the tide of the battle. After the fall of Boqueron, he regrouped with other members of Bolivian high command to discuss their next move. The meeting ended after a heated exchange between Quintanilla and Bilbao Rioja where Rioja ended up pulling out his pistol and aiming at Quintanilla, sparking a rivalry between these two officers."
BOL_Manuel_Marzana_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 7, 1889, in Tarabuco, Chuquisaca Province, Bolivia.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Manuel Marzana graduated from the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' as a second-lieutenant in 1914. He rose through the ranks until becoming commander right before the outbreak of the Chaco War. Manuel took part in the capture of the Boquerón fort, and would later lead its defence after Colonel Luis Emilio Aguirre was killed in action. Despite his valiant efforts, his troops were outnumbered and outgunned, managing to last twenty days until its capture. Marzana was kept as a POW for the rest of the conflict and was returned to Bolivia after hostilities ended."
BOL_Enrquie_Penarada_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 15, 1892, in the Bolivian Capital, La Paz.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Enrique Peñaranda del Castillo graduated from the 'Colegio Militar del Ejercito' in 1910 as a second-lieutenant, and slowly rose through the ranks until becoming Colonel in 1932. He took part in the failed relief effort during the Battle of Boquerón, later becoming commander of the Bolivian 4th Army, proceeding to organise the retreat towards Saavedra. He would later lead the relief effort to another encirclement during the Second Battle of Alihuatá, near Campo Vía. Despite the crushing defeat at the hands of the Paraguayan Army, Peñarada managed to evacuate the encircled troops. This led to him becoming a popular figure nationwide as a hero and led to his promotion to the position of Chief of the Bolivian Army, a post he kept until 1934. With his defeat at the battle of El Carmen, President Salamanca decided to remove him from his post, a move that eventually led to the Junta de Salvación Nacional's coup d'etat."

 mie.0.t:0 "The Russian Threat"
 mie.0.d:0 "Russia's decade long slump has ended, and now the Russians are rebuilding - already, they raise claims over their former Imperial territories, and Eastern European states are surely going to be one of their targets. To make sure that the Russian threat is contained and Eastern European states can defend their sovereignty, leaders and generals of the Oststaaten have gathered in [MIE_leader.Capital.GetName] to discuss a program of mutual cooperation. A joint military defence fund has been established and [MIE_leader.GetNameDef] has been entrusted with managing it to fund the region's joint defence ventures."
 mie.0.a:0 "Great!"

 MIE_decisions_desc:0 "[219.owner.GetNameDefCap] is resurgent, and the security of the Eastern European region is threatened. When the next War begins, we will have to brace ourselves against the Russian storm - and unless we work together, we will be picked off one by one.\n\nAfter [219.owner.GetNameDef] activates its foreign policy tree, all Eastern members of the Reichspakt unlock the ability to §Ypool resources§! and distribute them between their member states to eliminate any weak links. The country responsible for distributing the joint resource pool can invest in its fellow member states to §Ybuild fortifications§!, §Yraise divisions§!, and provide beneficial §YNational Ideas§!.\n\nCurrent pooled resources:\n    £rifle_texticon  Infantry Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_infantry_equipment]§!\n    £support_texticon  Support Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_support_equipment]§!\n    £unit_artillery_icon_small  Artillery Equipment: §Y[?global.MIE_artillery_equipment]§!\n\n[MIE_leader.GetNameWithFlag] is currently responsible for distributing the resource pool.[GetUKRSubersiveMIE]"
 
 MIE_decisions_GER: "Ostpolitik"
 MIE_decisions_GER_desc: "Our empire in the east spans from the Baltic to the Black Sea. The Oststaat are pragmatic mix of de facto client states held in line half by our strength, half by their fear of Russia. We constantly monitor their political developments and react when necessary.\n\n[POL_in_RP]"

 MIE_intermarium_formed: "Eastern European Defence Cooperation programme has started."

 GER_sponsor_MIE: "Sponsor the EEDC"
 GER_sponsor_MIE_desc: "The Eastern European Defence Cooperation was founded to coordinate the military build-up of the Oststaat armies. Our military-industrial complex has been involved in it, though more direct support from the government could strengthen them even more."
 GER_fight_forest_brothers: "Create the Baltische Feldgendarmerie"
 GER_fight_forest_brothers_desc: "Dispatching temporary military police force to the United Baltic Duchy might be necessary to help them in their fight against the Baltic separatists."
 GER_fight_LAF: "Reinforce the Lithuanian Police"
 GER_fight_LAF_desc: "The Lithuanian government has its hands full with the allegedly Russian-sponsored Lithuanian Activist Front, a terrorist organisation responsible for numerous heinous acts. We could dispatch them some specialist forces from Prussia to counter the insurgency."
 GER_WHR_coup: "Fight Belarusian Hramada"
 GER_WHR_coup_desc: "We have been tolerant towards White Ruthenia's experiments with leftwing democracy, but apparently this was a mistake. Our intelligence sources have informed us of their secret pact with Moscow and plans to betray us. This cannot be allowed to happen."
 GER_UKR_support: "Support the Hetmanate"
 GER_UKR_support_desc: "Ukraine is the most important out of our eastern allies, but the Skoropadskyi administration's grip on the nation has been steadily weakening as a consequence of incompetent handling of the economic crisis. By favouring the Ukrainian economy over the others, we could stabilise the situation there somewhat."

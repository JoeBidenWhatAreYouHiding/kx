## descriptions ##

Pius_XI:0 "Pius XI"
POLITICS_PIUS_XI_DESC:0 "Pope Pius XI has been the pope since 1922. Due to his Italian ethnicity and papal authority, he was the one to unite the Italian states after the King's exile. He is loved by Catholics both in and outside Italy."
POLITICS_PIUS_XII_DESC:0 "Pope Piux XII, formerly Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli, is a man of great spiritual fervour. He is renowned for his piety, but has a strong authoritarian streak that is matched only by his desire to protect the people."
POLITICS_STEPHEN_X_DESC:0 "Pope Stephen X, formerly Elia Cardinal dalla Costa, is a gentle man renown for his charitable nature and love of the poor. Most assume he will eventually turn the Papacy away from its direct rule of the nation, and already forces are gathering within Italy to determine who will undertake that role."
POLITICS_JOHN_XXIII_DESC:0 "Pope John XXIII, formerly Achille Cardinal Liènart, is a controversial choice as Pope. He is a well-known socialist, considered by some to even be a radical, and it's possible he was chosen by the Papacy due to the possibility his socialist leanings will lead to a reconciliation with the south."
POLITICS_JULIUS_IV_DESC:0 "Pope Julius IV, formerly Theodor Cardinal Innitzer, is a man renowned for his passion. He has been involved in the running of the Italian Federation for many years, and has declared syndicalism to be an evil he will battle until it is eradicated from the Earth."

### Focuses ###
ITA_Black_Monday:0 "Aftermath of Black Monday"
ITA_Black_Monday_desc:0 "The entire nation has fallen into despair and unemployment with the collapse of the economy. Finding our way out will be a long road, though we are better off than some."
ITA_Road_Network:0 "Nationalize the Austrian Businesses"
ITA_Road_Network_desc:0 "The Austrian influence on our Federation is obvious to everyone, and as long as they continue to own large sectors of our economy, the Austrian bastards will continue to control our government. We must take the first step to a free Italy and nationalize our vital industries."
ITA_Pontine_Marshes:0 "Clear the Pontine Marshes"
ITA_Pontine_Marshes_desc:0 "The marshlands in the Lazio region of central Italy have stood since the time of the Romans. A concerted effort to clear them will provide ample farmland, as well as work for many thousands of idle hands."
ITA_Industrialisation:0 "Raise the Tariffs"
ITA_Industrialisation_desc:0 "If we are to get through this crisis, we must first cancel most of our foreign trades, which have done nothing but forced us to sink money into other countries, when we should be focusing on recovering from this depression."
ITA_Construction_Effort:0 "Develop Construction Capabilities"
ITA_Construction_Effort_desc:0 "Our current industrial capacity is a disgrace to our country. We must make sure we expand our industrial capabilities."
ITA_Construction_Effort_II:0 "Improve Industrial Development"
ITA_Construction_Effort_II_desc:0 "Clearly, more industry funding is necessary for Italy to become a real industrial force."
ITA_Armament_Effort:0 "Strive for Autarky"
ITA_Armament_Effort_desc:0 "Our natural resources are vastly under-developed. If we were to ever go to war with the South, we would be completely unprepared, as we would lack the resources to keep our factories up and running. In these troubling times we must attempt towards autarky by investing in our own resources, rather than continuing relying on allies that will surely betray us should war ever arrive."
ITA_Armament_Effort_II:0 "Fill the Oil reserves"
ITA_Armament_Effort_II_desc:0 "Modern Warfare requires oil to fuel your ships, your vehicles and your air force. We must be able to produce a steady supply of fuel for our military, and so we must begin building many oil refineries."
ITA_Black_Monday_Recovery:0 "Black Monday Recovery"
ITA_Black_Monday_Recovery_desc:0 "The burst of construction and development in our country has clearly been enough to spur Italy's recovery from financial nightmare. Let us all celebrate!"
ITA_National_Reconstruction_Program:0 "National Development Program"
ITA_National_Reconstruction_Program_desc:0 "Over the last few decades, our one great country fell into disrepair. Our historical monuments lie damaged, and areas like the Pontine Marshes stand in our further development. This must not stand! Let us amaze the world by improving our country in numerous ways in a record time."
ITA_Initiate_Risoregimento:0 "Initiate Risorgimento"
ITA_Initiate_Risoregimento_desc:0 "For years, we have been waiting for the right time to strike against the syndicalist menace in the south, and now the time has finally come! Our men have been trained, our industry has been bolstered, and our will to reunite the nation burns brighter than ever! For Italy!"
ITA_Propose_Union:0 "Propose Peaceful Reunion"
ITA_Propose_Union_desc:0 "The only thing that is preventing a peaceful reunion with the south is their syndicalist, totalitarian government. If that were to change..."
ITA_Incorporate_South:0 "Incorporate the South"
ITA_Incorporate_South_desc:0 "After many years, and a grueling war, we have finally defeated our rival government in the south and reunited Italy, with our soldiers marching on to quell what little resistance remains. Indeed, this is a historical moment for all Italians, but now we must consolidate our control over these liberated lands, and free its people from the oppression of the defeated government."
ITA_Irredentism:0 "Reclaim Italia Irredenta!"
ITA_Irredentism_desc:0 "While we may have taken back the south of Italy, we cannot stop and fully declare victory yet. Millions of Italians live outside of their homeland, under the banners of a foreign government, and in areas that are historically ours by right. We must be willing to press our claims and expand our borders to free our brothers and sisters!"
ITA_Lombardy_Tension:0 "Remilitarized Lombardy" #world tension
ITA_Claim_Northeast:0 "Rescue the Northeast"
ITA_Claim_Northeast_desc:0  "A sore reminder of our past failures still remains in the Northeast, with Austrian boots in Venice. This cannot be the case any longer, and already many Italians across the nation have called for us to liberate our loyal citizens and reclaim Venice, Fiume, and other lands that were once ours. Now is the time for retribution!"
ITA_Claim_Italian_Switzerland:0 "Minorities in Ticino"
ITA_Claim_Italian_Switzerland_desc:0 "The Swiss dishonor us with their unwillingness to recognise our claims on lands they currently occupy. Many Italians clamor in Lugano, wanting to reunify with us. A plebiscite shall be held to determine their future, and we will do our best to make this dream of thousands come true."
ITA_Claim_Tunisia:0 "Protect East African Italians"
ITA_Claim_Tunisia_desc:0 "Many Italians still live in Eritrea and other nearby areas, having originally settled when we had controlled colonies in the area. Now, we have reason to believe that the Ethiopian government are abusing the rights of these Italians, therefore it is only natural that we intervene for their sake, and possibly reclaim more of our past legacy."
ITA_Claim_Malta:0 "Our Ties in Malta"
ITA_Claim_Malta_desc:0 "While Malta may be a small island, that does not make it any less Italian than it already is. Its historical ties with Sicily are more than enough proof that it is indeed a part of our nation like any other. Not only that, but it is also a fairly strategic position for naval operations. If we take the island back, it will be one less threat to face against."
ITA_Claim_Libya:0 "Take Back Libya"
ITA_Claim_Libya_desc:0 "When we defeated the Ottoman Empire in 1912, Libya was the greatest of all the spoils of that war, and a triumph that placed our kingdom in leagues with the likes of France and Britain. Now with the Ottomans exposed and at their weakest, we must strike once again, and take back Libya!"
ITA_Successful_Irredentist:0 "Greater Italia Reclaimed!"
ITA_Successful_Irredentist_desc:0 "Finally, we have triumphed. Against all the odds that were stacked against us, we have not only managed to reunite the peninsula, but also our colonies and lost territories under one flag and nation. Our age of humiliation is at an end, and now we stand tall as one of the great powers of the world. But we will not stop there - soon, the world shall know the might of Italy as it once had during the age of Rome! Onwards, to victory!"
ITA_Interventionism:0 "Italy and Her Allies"
ITA_Interventionism_desc:0 "With the second Risorgimento completed, we have now found our footing on the world stage once more - now is the time for us to reclaim our greater legacy as Italians!"
ITA_Join_Germany:0 "Alliance with the Kaiser"
ITA_Join_Germany_desc:0 "It is only obvious that we should stand besides the Kaiser. If we are to secure our homeland, we must have a strong ally, and who better than the German Empire? If we send an envoy to Berlin to request entrance into the Reichspakt they will be sure to accept, especially considering our border with the Commune of France. Together, our nations will stand second to none!"
ITA_Join_Austria:0 "A Visit to Vienna"
ITA_Join_Austria_desc:0 "Though our history with the Austrians has been tense to say the least, we cannot deny that they are better as allies than enemies. After all, a repeat of the humiliation brought to us during the Weltkrieg certainly means doom for our nation. Their close proximity and considerable military force ensures that we can rely on their support in these turbulent times."
ITA_Join_Canada:0 "Stand with the Entente Once More"
ITA_Join_Canada_desc:0 "The Entente would be able to help us defend ourselves with their mighty navy. They can use an ally, and so can we.""When Italy had joined the Entente in 1915, we were bolstered by the idea of gaining new territories and exerting our influence; it was tragic to see how much we had underestimated the Austrians, with our incompetent military and generals bringing the nation to ruin had it not been for sheer luck. Now we have learnt from our past, and have grown stronger as a result. With the French exiles to our south, and the Canadians with their impressive navy, we can honour the treaty of London and rejoin the Entente, freeing us from the ires of the Kaiserreich or the Habsburgs."
ITA_Our_Own_Faction:0 "The Italian Bloc"
ITA_Our_Own_Faction_desc:0 "We don't need the support of any other nation but our own - we owe no favors to the Germans, Austrians, or the British Exiles. After all, it was only by our own hands that we reunited Ital, and therefore, it only makes sense if we are to form our own bloc in order to establish Italy as the next world power. Viva Italia!"
ITA_Isolationism:0 "Put the Defence of Italy First!"
ITA_Isolationism_desc:0 "Already we had seen our beloved Italia torn apart once by our enemies and rebels, and it was no small feat to bring it back together. To overstep our bounds and misjudge our ambitions as we did during the first Weltkrieg will lead to disaster. We must look to protect our nation and its current borders."
ITA_Northern_Frontier:0 "Secure the Northern Frontier"
ITA_Northern_Frontier_desc:0 "One of the main reasons behind our humiliation at the hands of the Austrians was our lack of properly fortified defences. Never again shall we expose our lands so easily - reinforcing our borders will certainly keep them at bay."
ITA_Western_Frontier:0 "Prepare Against the Communards"
ITA_Western_Frontier_desc:0 "With the Commune of France seeking to reclaim their lost lands, many in our government have grown concerned. If they can so easily demand land from the Swiss, then what stops them from encroaching on our territories? As a measure of national security, we will construct military fortifications around Piedmont, as a warning to the Syndicalists and a message for the Italian people - we will not back down!"
ITA_Nationalization:0 "New Nationalist Thought"
ITA_Nationalization_desc:0 "Many people, revanchists and nationalists mostly, have recently spoken out against our new foreign policies, viewing it as a betrayal of our brothers entrapped by foreign boots. It is vital that we educate them that this is the only solution for a better Italy, and gain their support before it is too late."
ITA_Guard_the_Coasts:0 "Guard the Coasts"
ITA_Guard_the_Coasts_desc:0 "Our unique geography brings along with it many boons, but also some issues. Much of our coastlines are unprotected and leaves us exposed to naval invasions. To counter this, we should invest in fortifications across our most vulnerable coasts."
ITA_Papal_Conclave:0 "Call Papal Conclave"
ITA_Papal_Conclave_desc:0 "With the death of Pius XI, a conclave will need to be called by the cardinals to select a replacement - a Pope who will determine our path for the years to come."
ITA_Elia_dalla_Costa:0 "Pope Stephen X"
ITA_Elia_dalla_Costa_desc:0 "Elia dalla Costa is a man most favoured by the people due to his charitable nature. However, he is not a man overly interested in politics, and his election will most likely result in the papacy giving way to the rule of either the aristocracy or the people."
ITA_Soup_Kitchens:0 "Feed the Poor"
ITA_Soup_Kitchens_desc:0 "The poor of our country need to be fed, just as our Lord commands us to do. The new system of charity will make use of popular donations, allowing the government to invest its resources elsewhere."
ITA_Rise_Masses:0 "Rise of the Masses"
ITA_Rise_Masses_desc:0 "The thing about the poor is that they exist in multitudes. Fed, clothed, and provided the fire of inspiration which only God can provide, they can be marshalled to support the will of the Pope with a fervour unmatched by any mercenary."
ITA_Approach_Nobility:0 "Approach the Aristocracy"
ITA_Approach_Nobility_desc:0 "The Italian aristocracy still holds a great deal of power in the nation, and they are all too nervous of losing it entirely with the wave of democracy and syndicalism which has swept the continent. They must be reassured they have a place in the order to come."
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy:0 "Sideline the Aristocracy"
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy_desc:0 "The Italian aristocracy holds far too much power and wealth, and they will go to great lengths to protect it - even so far as to overthrow the pope, if they feel he is threatening their stranglehold on the people. That must end."
ITA_Centralise2:0 "Centralise the State"
ITA_Centralise2_desc:0 "The resistance of nobles to give way for further centralisation weakens us greatly. It is time to strengthen the position of our government, uniting the people against the dangers of our time."
ITA_Modern_Education_System:0 "Expand the Universities"
ITA_Modern_Education_System_desc:0 "We have so far neglected the need of modern and highly efficient education system and the necessity of keeping the scientists well supported. Our new progressive reform will improve our situation in this area greatly."
ITA_Reestablish_Monarchy:0 "Reestablish Monarchy"
ITA_Reestablish_Monarchy_desc:0 "As was to be expected, Pope Stephen X intends to step down as the head of state, allowing him to care for the poor more directly. Let us reestablish the Kingdom of Italy and choose a man worthy of being called King. Now, the Pope can step aside as Italy's head of state and instead rule the City of Rome while the rest of Italy is ruled by a King."
ITA_Theodor_Innitzer:0 "Pope Julius IV"
ITA_Establish_Democracy:0 "Establish Democracy"
ITA_Establish_Democracy_desc:0 "As was to be expected, Pope Stephen X intends to step down as the head of state, allowing him to care for the poor more directly. His legacy will be extending the rule of Italy to its people."
ITA_Achille_Lienart:0 "Pope John XXIII"
ITA_Achille_Lienart_desc:0 "A socialist at heart, Achille Lienart would do his utmost to prevent another Great War by decreasing the political tension. Electing him could even mean limited friendship with the syndicalists, no matter how unpopular such a move would be among Italian nationalists."
ITA_Worker_Rights_Reform:0 "Social Welfare Program"
ITA_Worker_Rights_Reform_desc:0 "There needs to be no revolution to reach the necessary social changes. As times change, so shall our law."
ITA_Secular_Trade_Unions:0 "Christian Trade Unions"
ITA_Secular_Trade_Unions_desc:0 "The trade unions are the bedrocks of the modern social state. Therefore they provide the perfect opportunity to further promote the word of Jesus!"
ITA_Industrialise_the_Peninsula:0 "Industrialise the Peninsula"
ITA_Industrialise_the_Peninsula_desc:0 "With the unions empowered, we must mobilise the workers of Italy to expand our industry and make it the heart of our growing state."
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy_II:0 "Sideline the Aristocracy"
ITA_Crush_Aristocracy_II_desc:0 "The Italian aristocracy holds far too much power and wealth, and they will go to great lengths to protect it - even so far as to overthrow the pope, if they feel he is threatening their stranglehold on the people. That must end."
ITA_Reconciliation:0 "Reconciliation"
ITA_Reconciliation_desc:0 "Italy does not need to be completely divided by ideology. While it will take many difficult talks to unite Italy once again, for the moment we can at least agree to mutually recognise our governments and embark upon an exchange of ideas."
ITA_Establish_Democracy_II:0 "Power to the People"
ITA_Establish_Democracy_II_desc:0 "The last step in social reform is recognising that God's place is to guide, not to rule. True power belongs in the people, and a socialist state must be erected to look after their welfare. Now, the Pope can step aside as Italy's head of state and instead rule the City of Rome while the rest of Italy is under a Republic."
ITA_Theodor_Innitzer:0 "Pope Julius IV"
ITA_Theodor_Innitzer_desc:0 "Theodor Innitzer is a man described by many as leaning to far right ideology. He warns against the evils of radical socialism, and declares he is willing to take up arms to defend Christendom by any means necessary."
ITA_Extended_Armament:0 "Extend Armament Production"
ITA_Extended_Armament_desc:0 "War in our time may be no shorter than the Great war. A stable supply of equipment for our troops will be invaluable."
ITA_Arm_the_Population:0 "Arm the People"
ITA_Arm_the_Population_desc:0 "Should the syndicalists come, it will be up to each and every Italian to guard their homes and take the fight to the enemy."
ITA_Promote_Corporativism_II:0 "Promote Corporativism"
ITA_Promote_Corporativism_II_desc:0 "The new Catholic way of governance will ensure every man of every occupation will be represented accordingly, leading to a much more stable government."
ITA_Centralise4:0 "Centralise the State"
ITA_Centralise4_desc:0 "The resistance of nobles to give way for further centralisation weakens us greatly. It is time to strengthen the position of our government, uniting the people against the dangers of our time."
ITA_Papal_Knights:0 "The Papal Knights"
ITA_Papal_Knights_desc:0 "The security of our borders is one matter, but we must also look to the enemies within. A new order of knights must be created to combat chaos in the name of God. They will watch the people closely indeed."
ITA_Papal_Authority:0 "Papal Authority"
ITA_Papal_Authority_desc:0 "The increasing secularisation of society means a lessening of the pope´s influence. However, there are ways by which we can increase his influence inside our own borders."
ITA_contra_principia:0 "Crusade Against Syndicalism"
ITA_contra_principia_desc:0 "While we would prefer peace, against the great evil of syndicalism there can be no compromise. We have put off the inevitable for far too long. Our military is ready and prepared to defend the catholic faith and liberate the land from the godless syndicalists that have desecrated the north."
ITA_Anti_Syndicalist_Encyclical:0 "Condemn Syndicalism"
ITA_Anti_Syndicalist_Encyclical_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a scourge of all things holy. It is unacceptable to let Catholics join syndicalists movements. The pope must publish an encyclical to make this clear."
ITA_Southern_Border:0 "Strengthen the Border"
ITA_Southern_Border_desc:0 "If an invasion comes, it will be by the evil syndicalists to the south. We must strengthen our border, fortify it to withstand the onslaught."
ITA_Eugenio_Pacelli:0 "Pope Pius XII"
ITA_Eugenio_Pacelli_desc:0 "Eugenio Pacelli is a man of peace and stability. His rule is perhaps sure to strengthen our country in many ways, making sure a mighty Italy walks the true path of God."
ITA_Promote_Traditional_Values:0 "Promote Traditional Values"
ITA_Promote_Traditional_Values_desc:0 "A christian population is a loyal one. Focusing our propaganda on this fact may prove fruitful."
ITA_Art_Funding:0 "The Beauty of God"
ITA_Art_Funding_desc:0 "Let the government patronise some of the most promising artists and architects. They will not forget it, and neither will the Italian people."
ITA_Encyclical_Corruption:0 "Encyclical Against Corruption"
ITA_Encyclical_Corruption_desc:0 "Pope Pius XII intends to issue a new encyclical, one aimed at corruption - both in the soul and within the government. It offers guidance to a nation struggling with finding its path."

ITA_reform_papal_law2_desc:0 "Pope Pius has recognized that the people are growing tired of the direct rule of the Pope, and he is willing to make concessions to the citizens of Italy by stepping his duties back to Rome and allowing the Federal Council to take on more of the State’s duties. "

### Events ###
italy.1.t:0 "Father Charles Coughlin"
italy.1.d:0 "Three years from today, Father Charles Coughlin started doing weekly a radio broadcast in America and more than 50 million people turn on their radios and listen. He is a raving Anti-Semite, claiming that the Syndicalist Revolution in France was 'foremented by the Jew' and that the Berlin Stock Market Crash is an 'International Conspiracy of Jewish Bankers' and somehow people still tune in. His hate-speech will not be tolerated by the Church, and the Pope is expected to make a decision whether to ask the United States government to shut down his broadcast so his hateful message cannot reach the public."
italy.1.a:0 "Ask the President of the United States to shut down this 'Radio Priest'"
italy.1.b:0 "It would be best if we did not interfere"

italy.2.t:0 "Gabriele d'Annunzio Dies"
italy.2.d:0 "Gabriele d'Annunzio died today of a stroke. Poet, journalist, novelist and above all a staunch Italian nationalist. Some suspected him of syndicalist views earlier in his life, but his unabated support to the Risorgimento cleared him of these wild accusations. His supporters used his funeral as an occasion to call for the Risorgimento of Italy."
italy.2.a:0 "He will be missed"

italy.3.t:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno"
italy.3.d:0 "Quadragesimo Quinto Anno (Latin for 'In the 45th Year') is a new encyclical written by Pope Pius XI that discusses the ethical implications of the social and economic order (45 years after Leo XIII's Rerum Novarum encyclical). The encyclical describes the major dangers for human freedom and dignity arising from unrestrained capitalism and syndicalism, calling for the reconstruction of the social order based on the principle of solidarity and subsidiarity. In the first part he reviews and applauds the encyclical of his predecessor, which helped the development of a new social conscience.\nAccording to Pius XI, three elements determine a fair wage: the worker's family responsibilities, the economic condition of the enterprise and the economy as a whole. The family has an innate right to development, but this is only possible within the framework of a functioning economy and sound enterprises. For this, Pope Pius concludes that solidarity, not conflict, is a necessary condition. The pope therefore demands more solidarity, especially between employers and employees through new forms of cooperation and communication among Catholic citizens. A new era of Catholic Corporativism is just beginning."
italy.3.a:0 "Excellent"

italy.4.t:0 "Move the Capital to Firenze?"
italy.4.d:0 "As Josef I von Österreich-Toskana is the new King of Italy and also the Grand Duke of Tuscany, some have proposed moving the capital from Rome to Florence. This move will probably be viewed favourably by the Austrians, but also with stern opposition by the Italians (especially considering that the Pope will remain in Rome)."
italy.4.a:0 "Roma is and will always be our capital!"
italy.4.b:0 "Firenze shall be the new capital!"

italy.5.t:0 "Donations from the Faithful"
italy.5.d:0 "With the very seat of God's church under threat from non-believers for the first time in centuries, donations have been pouring in from Catholics throughout the world."
italy.5.a:0 "Every bit counts"

italy.9.t:0 "Revolution"
italy.9.d:0 "The internal dissent has grown too far, and the people are revolting against our government, asking for democracy and free elections! What should we do? Should we suffocate the revolution on their blood or should we listen to their demands?"
italy.9.a:0 "Kill all those who oppose the government!"
italy.9.b:0 "Allow free elections"

italy.10.t:0 "War with Austria"
italy.10.d:0 "As we are now in a state of war with Austria, the demilitarised zone of Lombardy has become obsolete. We must move troops in to protect it at once."
italy.10.a:0 "I should say so!"

italy.12.t:0 "A King for Italy"
italy.12.d:0 "Pope [Root.GetLeader] has decreed that the monarchy in Italy is to be restored. The question remains, however: who shall become king? The four suitable candidates are Amedeo of Savoia-Aosta and Josef von Österreich-Toskana. The House of Savoia-Aosta is the cadet branch of the House of Savoia. Although the main branch was exiled after the Weltkrieg and is generally hated and despised by the population, Amedeo is popular and well-liked. On the other hand, Joseph is not only the Grand Duke of Tuscany and an Archduke of Austria, he is also a valuable military leader. However, certain staunch monarchists have brought forth a proposal to bring back our exiled king, Victor Emmanuel III."
italy.12.a:0 "Amedeo of Savoia-Aosta"
italy.12.b:0 "Josef von Österreich-Toskana"
italy.12.c:0 "Victor Emmanuel III, the true king of Italy!"
italy.12.e:0 "Ferdinando III."

italy.13.t:0 "Democratic Elections"
italy.13.d:0 "Since we now are a democratic country, it is time for free elections! There are five parties at the election: the Italian Popular Party (Partito Popolare Italiano) led by De Gasperi and Gronchi, the Liberal Party (Partito Liberale) lead by Ruini, the Democratic Party (Partito Democratico) led by Ivanoe Bonomi, the ANI led by Balbo and D'Annunzio, and the Italian Socialist Party (Partito Socialista Italiano) led by Secchia and Vassalli. Who will win the elections?"
italy.13.a:0 "The Italian Popular Party (Social-Conservative)!"
italy.13.b:0 "The Liberal Party (Social-Liberal)!"
italy.13.c:0 "The Democratic Party (Social-Democrat)!"
italy.13.e:0 "The Italian Socialist Party (Radical Socialist)!"
italy.13.f:0 "Associazione Nazionalista Italiana (National Populist)!"

italy.14.t:0 "The South is no more"
italy.14.d:0 "While our southern enemies are gone, we still have not reunified Italy. Even so, it does mean that the lingering question of our divided nation has been put to rest."
italy.14.a:0 "That's a start, at least"

italy.15.t:0 "A Proposal from the North"
italy.15.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has approached us and, together with the congratulations for our new government, has asked if we wish to become a part of their country. They believe we can achieve a peaceful unification through negotiations. What should we answer?"
italy.15.a:0 "Accept, for a new united Italy!"
italy.15.b:0 "No, we will never be ruled by you!"

italy.16.t:0 "The South Accepted our Proposal!"
italy.16.d:0 "The government of [From.GetNameDef] has accepted our proposal! Despite some grumbling, a new united Italy is born!"
italy.16.a:0 "Time to look beyond the peninsula!"

italy.17.t:0 "The South Rejected our Proposal"
italy.17.d:0 "The stupid politicians in [From.GetNameDef] have refused to accept our proposal, determined to keep Italy split in two. Already there are people in the street demanding that we do something to put an end to this foolishness."
italy.17.a:0 "Let's not be rash..."
italy.17.b:0 "They are absolutely right!"

italy.18.t:0 "Italy Seeks to Join Faction"
italy.18.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has sent diplomats, seeking to join the [Root.GetAdjective]-led faction for the benefit of both parties. Failing that, they request [Root.GetNameDef]'s protection, and in return will allow [Root.GetAdjective] troops access through their territory."
italy.18.a:0 "Admit them into the faction"
italy.18.b:0 "We will guarantee their independence instead"
italy.18.c:0 "They are on their own"

italy.19.t:0 "Italy Seeks Protection"
italy.19.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has sent diplomats, seeking Root.GetNameDef]'s protection of their borders, and in return will allow [Root.GetAdjective] troops access through their territory."
italy.19.a:0 "That sounds like an excellent deal"
italy.19.b:0 "They are on their own"

italy.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees"
italy.20.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has agreed that [Root.GetNameDef] will be a useful addition to their faction. An alliance between the two nations has now been created."
italy.20.a:0 "We have thrown our lot in with theirs..."

italy.21.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Protection"
italy.21.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has offered [From.GetAdjective] protection of [Root.GetNameDef] continued independence, in exchange for military access through our territory."
italy.21.a:0 "That sounds like a good deal"
italy.21.b:0 "Absolutely ludicrous! Deny this spit in our face at once!"

italy.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
italy.22.d:0 "Diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] have refused any offers of alliance or requests for the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] independence. We are on our own."
italy.22.a:0 "So be it"

italy.23.t:0 "[new_italian_core.GetName] Under Our Control"
italy.23.d:0 "Our control over [new_italian_core.GetName] has finally been consolidated! It is now considered an integral part of [Root.GetNameDef]."
italy.23.a:0 "Long live [Root.GetNameDef]!"

italy.24.t:0 "The Italians Bark Back"
italy.24.d:0 "Though our counteroffer was generous while also necessarily taking into account the sheer fragility of the current global order, the ruling Italian regime has denied our offer of aid and guarantees to their maintained national sovereignty. Their government has decided to look elsewhere on the diplomatic stage for allies and compatriots, while our alliance will soldier ever onwards, with or without the ever-squabbling Italians."
italy.24.a:0 "So be it. We can find better allies and better wine elsewhere!"

italy.25.t:0 "A New Direction for Italy’s Future"
italy.25.d:0 "With our last overtures and talks of cooperation failing miserably, our diplomatic delegation, instead of returning to Rome, has instead been instructed to immediately make preparations for a trip to another one of the great alliances’ capitals to quickly and urgently find a new alliance for our newly stabilized and unified pan-Italian regime to seek shelter within. Though we have stabilized, the rest of the World has long been on a collision course with absolute disaster, and we must be ready for when this chaos reaches our own borders. So, where shall we send our delegation?"
italy.25.a:0 "Petition the Kaiser in Vienna."
italy.25.b:0 "We shall look to the Kaiser in Berlin instead."
italy.25.c:0 "Reach out to our old allies of the Weltkrieg."
italy.25.e:0 "Italy shall stand alone!"

italy.26.t:0 "King [From.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
italy.26.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties with our nation."
italy.26.a:0 "What a lovely visit!"
italy.26.b:0 "We will ensure Italy's continued independence"
italy.26.c:0 "We will return Venetia to our faithful allies"

italy.27.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
italy.27.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries."
italy.27.a:0 "That's it? Nothing else?"

italy.28.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
italy.28.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries. He returns to Italy with assurances from Austria that they will fight to guarantee our future independence."
italy.28.a:0 "That's something, I suppose"
italy.29.t:0 "King [Root.GetLeader] Visits Austria"
italy.29.d:0 "The recently-crowned king of Italy, King [From.GetLeader], has made an official state visit to Austria to meet with the Emperor in order to engineer better ties between our countries. He returns to Italy having won the return of lands in Venetia and assurances of support from Austria."
italy.29.a:0 "Well done!"

italy.30.t:0 "Black Monday hits [Root.GetName]!"
italy.30.d:0 "Almost two weeks ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depth, throwing Germany's economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now the crash's shock waves have reached [Root.GetName]. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Italian lira is losing value, and industrial exports are shrinking..."
italy.30.a:0 "Let's hope the government will save us from the worst..."

italy.31.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes"
italy.31.d:0 "The order has been given to clear the Pontine Marshes and thus open the once-useless land for farming or industry. The plan will require the employment of thousands of Italians and take many months to get the bulk of it done, but the outcome may be worth it."
italy.31.a:0 "So long as it keeps them working, I'm happy"

italy.32.t:0 "The Pontine Marshes are Cleared"
italy.32.d:0 "The areas formerly known as the Pontine Marshes are now cleared, with factories and farms springing up throughout the area. More importantly is the hope this brings to the nation, that the malaise hanging over [Root.GetName] by the effects of Black Monday might one day actually come to an end."
italy.32.a:0 "A monumental achievement!"

italy.33.t:0 "Worsening Economic Conditions"
italy.33.d:0 "The economic fallout from Black Monday is getting worse day by day, as we underestimated its initial effects and took limited action to counter them. There are some laissez faire economists who argue that nothing should be done and that the market will recover itself eventually. There are others among the Church who advocate a continuation of a campaign started by Pius XI for the creation of Catholic corporations: they would be structured, organised and controlled with our support, and lead to the creation of many new independent unions that support workers. Some believe that will give rise to more syndicalist sentiment, however."
italy.33.a:0 "Support and organise the Catholic Corporations"
italy.33.b:0 "Put more people to work, no matter the cost"
italy.33.c:0 "Allow the creation of non-catholic unions"
italy.33.e:0 "Do nothing, let the market recover itself"

italy.34.t:0 "The Economy Recovers"
italy.34.d:0 "The bad effects of Black Monday have finally disappeared: we can look at the future with hope. The economy is finally recovered!"
italy.34.a:0 "The Catholic Corporations saved the country!"
italy.34.b:0 "The market recovered on its own!"
italy.34.c:0 "The trade unions saved the country!"
italy.34.e:0 "The work programs seem to have done the trick!"

italy.35.t:0 "Stage 1"
italy.35.d:0 "The first part of the National development program consists of government making use of the most modern, even experimental techniques for the construction. This will help us in the future."
italy.35.a:0 "Let the work begin!"

italy.36.t:0 "Stage 2"
italy.36.d:0 "The second part of the National development program includes construction of the so called 'Culture houses'. They will function as a way to boost the national pride of our people. The construction itself is bound to make the people content with the government."
italy.36.a:0 "Let´s continue!"

italy.37.t:0 "Stage 3"
italy.37.d:0 "The third part of the National development program has technically been going on since the programs initiation, but now that the rest of the work is done, the progress can accelerate. This part consists of various efforts of land clearance, such as the clearance of Pontine marshes. This will enable us to improve our long-term industrial potential."
italy.37.a:0 "Yes, do it!"

italy.38.t:0 "National Construction Program Finished"
italy.38.d:0 "The program has been a great success! Not only the population likes the results, but, perhaps even more importantly, the government does. Now, it is time to put our effort elsewhere."
italy.38.a:0 "Great job, guys!"

italy.41.t:0 "The Death of Pius XI"
italy.41.d:0 "With the passing of the Pope, what action should we take? Mourn the Pope's death or attempt to install the loyal Duke Giuseppe di Toscana on the throne? Doing so would make [From.GetName] a puppet of Austria, though it would greatly displease the many Catholics of our nation."
italy.41.a:0 "Send our Condolences to Rome"
italy.41.b:0 "Press the claims of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana"

italy.42.t:0 "Austria Interferes!"
italy.42.d:0 "[From.GetName] is insisting on the installation of Duke Giuseppe di Toscana as King of Italy, interfering with the Papal Election."
italy.42.a:0 "An emergency conclave elects Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"
italy.42.b:0 "Elect Giuseppe, we are an Austrian dominion once again"
italy.42.c:0 "Innitzer will crown Giuseppe, but we shall remain independent"

italy.43.t:0 "The Papacy Under Innitzer Resists!"
italy.43.d:0 "The Papacy has defied the prospect of our noble rule, and Cardinal Innitzer has convened an emergency conclave to have himself declared Pope Julius IV. What course of action shall we take now?"
italy.43.a:0 "If they won't give their independence, we shall take it! To war!"
italy.43.b:0 "Italy is not worth the trouble, back down"
italy.43.c:0 "Beg the Papacy for forgiveness!"

italy.44.t:0 "Austria Backs Down"
italy.44.d:0 "Though we've watched the border for signs of Austrian aggression, there appears to be none. [From.GetLeader] has apparently backed away from his threat."
italy.44.a:0 "Did they think they could bully us so easily?"

italy.45.t:0 "Austria Apologizes"
italy.45.d:0 "Though we were ready for an invasion, what has occurred is quite the opposite. An envoy from [From.GetNameDef] has expressed apologies from [From.GetLeader] to His Holiness for any offence, and states he will fight to protect our independence in the years to come. \nThis is truly a victory for the Italian nation"
italy.45.a:0 "Well that was unexpected..."

italy.46.t:0 "Italy Submits!"
italy.46.d:0 "Italy caved in to the Austrian Empire as expected, and now Duke Giuseppe sits on the Italian throne as Giuseppe I, a puppet under our benevolent rule."
italy.46.a:0 "Hurrah!"
italy.46.b:0 "Great news, in exchange we will return Venetia!"

italy.47.t:0 "Innitzer Proclaims Giuseppe as King!"
italy.47.d:0 "Duke Giuseppe has been proclaimed king, as per our demand, but Cardinal Innitzer has engineered a means to retain control over the government. Thus Italy will not be under our control, regardless of the king's true wishes."
italy.47.a:0 "We endorse this result whole-heartedly!"
italy.47.b:0 "Very well, but we shall keep our distance"
italy.47.c:0 "Demand Innitzer step down immediately!"

italy.48.t:0 "Austria Supports Italian Kingdom"
italy.48.d:0 "As Duke Giuseppe ascends to the Italian throne, Austria has sent word that they support our kingdom whole-heartedly and have offered to protect our future independence."
italy.48.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

italy.49.t:0 "Giuseppe Takes the Throne"
italy.49.d:0 "While our government worried that Austria's true plan was to take control of Italy through King Giuseppe, they have remained silent on the matter of our continued independence. [From.GetLeader] declined to attend the king'd coronation, and there has been no further contact."
italy.49.a:0 "No news is good news, right?"

italy.50.t:0 "Austria Wants Innitzer Gone!"
italy.50.d:0 "While Austria is apparently pleased with the crowning of Josef, they have shown their true colours by demanding Innitzer step down from the Papacy and for Cardinal Elia Dalla Costa to replace him!"
italy.50.a:0 "Refuse and overthrow the false king!"
italy.50.b:0 "As our new overlords wish..."

italy.55.t:0 "The Papal Conclave"
italy.55.d:0 "The Holy See has finally came together to deliberate the election of a new Pope following Pius XI's death. In the end they choose to..."
italy.55.a:0 "...elect the pious and popular Eugenio Cardinal Pacelli as Pius XII"
italy.55.b:0 "...elect the charitable Elia Cardinal dalla Costa as Stephen X"
italy.55.c:0 "...elect the socialist cardinal, Achille Liènart, as John XXIII"
italy.55.e:0 "...elect the hardliner Theodor Cardinal Innitzer as Julius IV"

italy.56.t:0 "Condemn Pope [From.GetLeader]?"
italy.56.d:0 "A conclave has elected Pope [From.GetLeader] as the head of the Catholic Church, and thus the ruler of northern Italy. We should condemn him as a potential danger to our nation, but the majority of our people are Catholic and might be upset. Even so, should we stand by and watch our own brethren be brainwashed into such unjust rule?"
italy.56.a:0 "Religion is - always had been - the enemy of the Proletariat"
italy.56.b:0 "No, Pope [From.GetLeader] is a socialist and friend of the Republic"
italy.56.c:0 "Maybe we can come to terms with this new Pope?"

italy.57.t:0 "The Commune Condemns the Pope"
italy.57.d:0 "Reacting to the recent ascension of Pope [Root.GetLeader], the Syndicalist Italian Commune in the south has condemned the Holy Father and the Church in a public speech. We must react to this insult."
italy.57.a:0 "Issue an encyclical against syndicalism"
italy.57.b:0 "Love thy enemies"

italy.58.t:0 "Papal Encyclical Against Syndicalism"
italy.58.d:0 "Pope [From.GetLeader] has issued an outrageous encyclical condemning Syndicalism, and as a result our mainly Catholic population is growing increasingly restless..."
italy.58.a:0 "Confiscate church property!"
italy.58.b:0 "Let this go no further"

italy.59.t:0 "The Catholic Exodus"
italy.59.d:0 "Ever since our government began its crackdown on Catholics, many people have begun to emigrate north into [ITA.GetNameDef]. The main artery for this so-called 'exodus' is, apparently, the small border port of Anzio."
italy.59.a:0 "Seal off the border and occupy Anzio"
italy.59.b:0 "Less drastic measures will have to be employed"

italy.60.t:0 "The Exodus"
italy.60.d:0 "Ever since the Catholic Church issued its encyclical against Syndicalism, thousands of our faithful brothers in the south have fled north to liberty."
italy.60.a:0 "Welcome!"

italy.61.t:0 "The Battle of Anzio"
italy.61.d:0 "In responce to the mass flight of Catholic faithful north, the syndicalists of [From.GetNameDef] sealed the border. In the early morning hours of the following day, [From.GetAdjective] troops attacked Anzio - a main artery of the exodus and are quickly overrunning the city. We can either let this happen or meet force with force!"
italy.61.a:0 "We have lost this battle"
italy.61.b:0 "Deus vult!"

italy.62.t:0 "The Battle of Anzio"
italy.62.d:0 "Our troops have successfully occupied Anzio, while our losses were very light. [From.GetNameDef] is, it seems, too afraid of our power to oppose us in any meaningful way."
italy.62.a:0 "Excellent"

italy.63.t:0 "Syndicalist Agitation"
italy.63.d:0 "While support in [ITA.GetNameDef] for the syndicalist cause is minimal, there have been growing rallies in the southern part of the country claiming that [SRI.GetNameDef] has been unfairly demonized by the papacy, and that Italian workers will only see improvement under a syndicalist government. The rallies have been tied to an increasing number of outbreaks of violence, and investigators are convinced the southern government is behind it all. It seems we are left with no choice but to face these rebels head-on."
italy.63.a:0 "We shall do so swiftly"

italy.64.t:0 "Syndicalist Bombing!"
italy.64.d:0 "The socialist rebels have targeted a factory in [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."
italy.64.a:0 "We will get them sooner or later..."

italy.65.t:0 "Syndicalist Bombing!"
italy.65.d:0 "The socialist rebels have targeted an arms factory in [attack_state.GetName], causing a great deal of damage and the loss of many lives. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."

italy.66.t:0 "Syndicalists Attack Infrastructure!"
italy.66.d:0 "The socialist rebels have set off a series of bombs in the [attack_state.GetName] region, causing considerable damage to the roads system and traffic snarls for miles. Italian investigators are on the scene, and claim they are closer to catching the ringleaders behind the rebels than they were before."
italy.67.t:0 "Ringleaders Apprehended!"

italy.67.d:0 "Earlier today, several of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation were apprehended by Italian investigators. This is a serious blow to the rebels, and brings the country one step closer to eliminating them for good."
italy.67.d.last:0 "Earlier today, the last of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation were apprehended by Italian investigators. This puts an end to the group's operations within [ITA.GetNameDef], and an example will be made of the men to ensure that no other socialists get similar ideas in the future."
italy.67.a:0 "The sooner, the better!"
italy.67.b:0 "Finally!"

italy.68.t:0 "Syndicalist Agitation in the North"
italy.68.d:0 "It appears our efforts to establish greater syndicalist support in [ITA.GetNameDef] have met with success - there have been numerous socialist rallies in the southern part of their nation, which have grown to the point where there is now violent support to overthrow the papacy. We shall see how long this impedes their progress."
italy.68.a:0 "Our support for the rebels will certainly help"

italy.69.t:0 "Last Syndicalists Arrested"
italy.69.d:0 "It appears the last of the ringleaders behind the syndicalist agitation in [ITA.GetNameDef] have finally been arrested by the Italian government. The rebels did some damage, however, and we shall have to be content with the demonstration they made."
italy.69.a:0 "Now we must finish the job"

italy.70.t:0 "The Italians in Switzerland"
italy.70.d:0 "The state of Ticino is home to a large Italian population, which has warmly received the news of [From.GetNameDef]'s irredentist claims on Italian lands. Today, the [From.GetAdjective] government has taken a more aggressive stance regarding Ticino and officially requested that we organise a referendum on whether its population wishes to remain a part of [Root.GetNameDef] or join [From.GetNameDef]."
italy.70.a:0 "They must be joking, right?"
italy.70.b:0 "Accept their proposal, call up a referendum on the matter"

italy.71.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
italy.71.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has declined our proposal for a fair and democratic referendum on Italian-inhabited Ticino. What should we do now? Should we forget the matter or threaten them with war?"
italy.71.a:0 "Forget about this matter, just present our territorial claims instead"
italy.71.b:0 "Mobilise our divisions on the border and threaten them with war"

italy.72.t:0 "An Italian Ultimatum"
italy.72.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to abide by our decision to not conduct a referendum in Ticino. Not only that, but they have mobilised their divisions on the border areas. According to our intelligence reports, their troops are ready cross into our territory in just a few hours, unless we bow to their demands and allow the plebiscite to proceed..."
italy.72.a:0 "We must comply to their demands, the referendum must occur"
italy.72.b:0 "We are ready to defend our country"

italy.73.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses our Ultimatum"
italy.73.d:0 "The stubborn [From.GetAdjective] government has refused to comply with our demands. With our troops mobilised on their border, this is the perfect moment to move into the disputed territories and seize them. International condemnation of our acts is a sure side-effect of this, however."
italy.73.a:0 "Cancel all plans and demobilise our troops"
italy.73.b:0 "Cross the border and seize the disputed territories"

italy.74.t:0 "Italian Troops have Entered Ticino"
italy.74.d:0 "The murderous [From.GetAdjective] army has invaded [Root.GetAdjective] territory in order to seize the disputed state of Ticino! They expect that we simply lay down our arms and retreat north, but our forces are fully capable of defending the land and even moving into [From.GetAdjective] territory itself!"
italy.74.a:0 "Lay down our arms and surrender Ticino"
italy.74.b:0 "Order our troops to resist the invasion"

italy.75.t:0 "Ticino is Ours"
italy.75.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has complied with our wishes and surrendered the disputed province to us."
italy.75.a:0 "Great!"

italy.76.t:0 "Crisis in Switzerland"
italy.76.d:0 "[aggressor.GetNameDef], in a clear violation of Swiss neutrality, has invaded the Swiss province of Ticino under the claim that Switzerland refuses to allow a referendum of the Italians living there regarding whether they wish to rejoin their homeland. This is a clear breach of international law and, as a prime power in Europe, we have the duty to warn [aggressor.GetNameDef] they must stop this madness or face the consequences."
italy.76.a:0 "This is not of our concern"
italy.76.b:0 "Guarantee Switzerland's borders"

italy.77.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Ultimatum"
italy.77.d:0 "Upon hearing news of our ongoing intervention in Switzerland, [From.GetNameDef] has warned us to halt the offensive, pull back to our borders and call an end to hostilities, unless we want to face [From.GetAdjective] arms."
italy.77.a:0 "Pull back, we can't risk war with [From.GetNameDef]"
italy.77.b:0 "We will not respond to their threats"

italy.78.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] and Italian troops have Exchanged Fire"
italy.78.d:0 "Italian and [From.GetAdjective] forces have exchanged fire inside the territory of Ticino, with some artillery fire also hitting Italian lands. With casualties now reaching the hundreds in both sides, we must decide on whether to pull back or escalate the conflict and officially declare war on [From.GetNameDef]."
italy.78.a:0 "Pull back, cancel the invasion"
italy.78.b:0 "Order a general mobilisation and declare war"

italy.79.t:0 "A Referendum is Called"
italy.79.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has complied with our demands and an emergency referendum has been called in Ticino. It will occur in two weeks."
italy.79.a:0 "We will watch this closely"

italy.80.t:0 "The Ticino Referendum"
italy.80.d:0 "As agreed, a referendum to decide the fate of Ticino has been called, and its inhabitants will decide if they wish to stay a part of [Root.GetNameDef] or join [From.GetNameDef]."
italy.80.a:0 "It will be a close vote..."

italy.81.t:0 "Ticino Referendum - Italian Defeat"
italy.81.d:0 "As agreed, a referendum to decide the fate of Ticino was called, and its inhabitants voted to remain a part of [From.GetNameDef]. Nonetheless, some members of our cabinet still favour a military solution to the situation and propose an invasion of the disputed territory."
italy.81.a:0 "Respect the results"
italy.81.b:0 "Cross the border and seize Ticino"

italy.82.t:0 "The Italians Control Ticino"
italy.82.d:0 "The war with the Italians is going poorly. Currently they have full control over Ticino, and we are quickly losing ground. Is the canton truly worth fighting for, and even risking complete annexation?"
italy.82.a:0 "Send the envoys and offer to surrender Ticino"
italy.82.b:0 "This war won't stop until we're marching on Rome!"

italy.83.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sues for Peace"
italy.83.d:0 "The war with [From.GetNameDef] goes well, and already we have control over Ticino and are pushing further into our enemy's lands. They have quickly sent an envoy, asking for white peace and offering to surrender Ticino to us with no questions asked."

Once word got out that Austria would force the Peninsula to be reorganized into her old pre-unification states within a loose Federation, a coalition of both socialists and nationalists would declare the Republic of Italy in Torino. Faced with overwhelming resistance from both local militias and the Austrian occupation force, the Republic was forced to retreat to the southern half of Italy; where they were able to set up a powerbase due to the Red militias silencing every dissenter. Months later, an armistice was signed with the newly-proclaimed Socialist Republic of Italy, and now both sides have mostly stabilized. \nEver since the Federation was created, it has been under the rule of Pope Pius XI, whose popularity has kept the nation together, although his health is rapidly declining and there are many who would wish to take his role as leader of the Federation. Though with all this, one thing is certain, Italy must be united again!"

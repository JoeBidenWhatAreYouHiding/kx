natal.1.t:0 "Natal's Secessionist Force"
natal.1.d:0 "The Provincial Council of Natal has overwhelmingly the declaration of loyalty to the Empire, and the Natalian population already decreed its support for the course of action, both in electing this provincial council as through their signing of the Natal Covenant.\n\nHowever, a reaction from Pretoria is likely to be forthcoming, and if Natal is to survive then a certain military backing will be required.\n\nTo this end, the Provincial Council-now-to-be-Natalian Parliament has called upon all the king-emperor's loyal subject to take up arms in defence against the vile Boers in Pretoria. To the relief of the government, the call has received an enthusiastic response, and the Natal Mounted Rifles have defected to the secessionists. Certain military leaders of the UDF also declared their support for our cause."
natal.1.a:0 "To arms, for his majesty!"
natal.2.t:0 "Loyalist Militias rise!"
natal.2.d:0 "Our choice to seize the moment and declare our independence is far from universally supported. While in both the Cape and Transvaal provinces a full-on declaration of secession could be avoided on account of the large segment of conservative Afrikaner populations that strongly support our republican cause, these provinces still have a significant white English-speaker demographic incensed by our abandonment of the Imperial fold. Certain groups of liberal Afrikaners in the Cape have also sided with the Anglo-South African cause to bring South Africa back into the imperial fold. As such, militias which have declared support for the Natal government have risen in Cape Town, Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth, and it has to be concluded that the government does not exercise effective control in the Eastern Cape coast between Natal and Port Elizabeth any longer."
natal.2.a:0 "We will crush those traitors!"
natal.3.t:0 "Loyalist Militias rise!"
natal.3.d:0 "Good news! English-speaking populations and even certain liberal Afrikaner groups in the Cape have denounced the government's declaration of the republic and have risen in Natal-aligned militias throughout the country. The most they have seized effective control over a significant chunk of the east of the Cape Province between Natal and Port Elizabeth, and in the urban areas of Port Elizabeth itself, Cape Town and Johannesburg loyalist militias are skirmishing with South African Army units.\n\nThroughout the country, support for the imperial cause is present, but defeating the Boer menace will likely not be an easy task to fulfill."
natal.3.a:0 "The Boers should be afraid!"
natal.4.t:0 "Rejoining the Empire"
natal.4.d:0 "We have left the treacherous and illegitimate republic by the grace of God. Now it is time to swear our fealty to the one and true legitimate king once more.\n\nRealistically speaking, the overwhelming support we are receiving here in South Africa is likely insufficient to actually defeat the Afrikaners and their professional military. Therefore, our envoy, who will be leaving from Mozambique where he will be joined by a representative from Southern Rhodesia, will also request formal recognition by the Empire and seek official reinforcement. We recognize that the focus of the exiles is at the homecoming, we do. But if we, his majesty's loyal subjects from Southern Africa, are to help them fulfill this goal, we will need their help."
natal.4.a:0 "Safe travels!"
natal.5.t:0 "Natal and Southern Rhodesia seek our recognition and support"
natal.5.d:0 "The Afrikaner Nationalist government of our now-former dominion of South Africa has declared itself a republic and distanced itself from the Empire. Two provinces of South Africa, the provinces of Natal and Southern Rhodesia, which have an English-speaking white electorate, have denounced this illegal secession and declared their own independence from the newly-minted Republic of South Africa.\n\nOf course, the South African government has exerted its intention to reclaim the loyalist provinces. These provinces have now sent envoys to us begging for our recognition and our intervention to save them from near-certain domination by South Africa's Dutch-descended, numerically larger, Afrikaner settler population.\n\nThis brings forth a dilemma, for a third Boer War could become costly and distract from the homecoming to a degree, but on the other hand we can hardly condemn our loyal subjects to Boer rule."
natal.5.a:0 "We can always sign a peace if it drags out."
natal.5.b:0 "Commendable initiative, but you're on your own."
natal.6.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Promises Reinforcements"
natal.6.d:0 "Great news: our envoys have arrived from [From.GetCountryNameDef]. They affirm that the exile government has agreed to support our cause and that reinforcements are on their way to relieve the pressure exerted by South African forces on our local forces. All we have to do now is hold out long enough for these forces from across the empire to arrive!"
natal.6.a:0 "God save our gracious king!"
natal.7.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] does not send support"
natal.7.d:0 "Unfortunate news: citing the need to focus on the homecoming, the [From.GetAdjective] government has neglected to promise support from elsewhere in the Empire.\n\nThey did express their full support for our cause and claimed that with the grace of God, we would be able to defeat the illegitimate republic on our own account. However, without reinforcements, God's help may not suffice to defeat South Africa's professional military, and this betrayal has already put a dent in our morale: we are fighting for a monarchy that seemingly does not care for our fate."
natal.7.a:0 "Still, we will not go down without a fight!"
natal.8.t:0 "The Port Elizabeth Declaration"
natal.8.d:0 "'Recognizing that the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act has never properly been granted Royal Assent and asserting that Afrikaner support can grant no mandate under any circumstance to sever the relation between South Africa's British population and the British crown, this document affirms that the Republic of South Africa does not form a legitimate and indeed sovereign state in any capacity.'\n\nThis is the opening sentence of the Port Elizabeth Declaration, a document drafted by the mayor of Port Elizabeth and signed by several prominent members of the Natal administration. The document asserts that the republican government of South Africa holds no legitimacy and radically amends the South Africa Act as it was before the Republic of South Africa Constitution Act, establishing a federal model similar to Canada or Australasia, and entrenching the monarchist form of government. The significance of the document comes forth from it being subsequently approved by the Natalian parliament, staking their claim to being not merely a secessionist entity, but a rival government to the republic intent on usurping its position after the end of the Boer War."
natal.8.a:0 "A Federal South Africa shall rise!"
natal.9.t:0 "The Port Elizabeth Declaration"
natal.9.d:0 "The treacherous Natalians and their illegitimate parliament have passed the Port Elizabeth declaration, which had been drafted by the mayor of Port Elizabeth. The document denies the legitimacy of the Republic of South Africa, and makes for a Natalian claim of being the true South African government, with an amended South Africa Act that entrenches the monarchist form of government and bases itself on a federal model similar to Australasia and Canada. This declaration significantly increases the stakes of the war, because now it is either victory, or death."

natal.10.t:0 "The Navy Defects to our side"
natal.10.d:0 "South Africa's navy has never amounted to much, merely being a small detachment of ships acquired from the Royal Navy. The limited Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve's officer corps, as well as most people in the vicinity of its primary base, Simon's Town near Cape Town, sympathies with our stated goals and have defected to our ranks and set sail from the beleaguered Simon's Town toward Durban."
natal.10.a:0 "Natal rules the Waves!"
natal.11.t:0 "The Naval Volunteer Reserve defects to Natal"
natal.11.d:0 "Disaster, the navy of the Union of South Africa, the Naval Volunteer Reserve, has defected from our ranks and declared their allegiance to the rebels in Natal. While this isn't much of a surprise, given the sympathies held by most marine personnel and the inhabitants of the main marine base of Simon's Town, it is still considered a setback as military control could perhaps delay the influx of supplies from the British empire or delay any potential invasion, to which we are now certainly exposed."
natal.11.a:0 "Treachery on the land and in the sea!"
natal.12.t:0 "Peace with [SAF.GetNameDef]"
natal.12.d:0 "We have successfully defended [Root.GetNameDef] from the republicans of South Africa, and their morale is dangling as a result of a failure. We could take this opportunity to enforce a peace and secure our independence and loyalty to the Empire, but this would entail giving up on the hoped notion of destroying the republican government and restoring British governance throughout all of South Africa."
natal.12.a:0 "It is time to extend the olive branch."

The grand British empire is on its knees, and has been forced to recognize our complete independence of their yoke, our control over Natal, Southern Rhodesia, that the High Commissioner Territories officially and unreservedly belong to us. Bells toll in all Afrikaner towns and cities, and crowds sing 'Die Stem van Suid-Afrika' in celebration and burn the Union Jack.\n\nCrowds in Pretoria are shouting down the [ENT.GetAdjective] diplomats that have arrived to sign their government's acceptance that South Africa will be a free and independent member of the international community."
natal.16.a:0 "If only Paul Kruger could see us now!"
natal.18.t:0 "Natives in Natal"
natal.18.d:0 "The former Natal Province, and now the Natal dominion, is not only the heartland of the Anglo-South African diaspora: in this same region, the legendary Shaka Zulu consolidated the Zulu kingdom, which lasted until their eventual defeat to the encroaching British Empire in the Anglo-Zulu war in 1871.\n\nThis historical background is the primary reason that still today, most natives, who make up a very large majority of Natal's population, are Zulu's. Like South Africa we are a white minority-ruled state, as the province and colony of Natal were. The new government should however re-evaluate the status of the Zulu people, now that Natal has left South Africa and reattained full self-governance."
natal.18.a:0 "To an extent, cooperation is necessary."
natal.18.b:0 "Only repression can keep White Natalians safe."
natal.19.t:0 "Working with the ICU?"
natal.19.d:0 "Back when we were part of South Africa, affiliating with the ICU would have been unthinkable, and the result of such actions revealed themselves when Labour minister Walter Madely did so, causing a split in the party.\n\nOur government is not afraid to indeed work with the ICU for the betterment of Natal. The ICU has a lot of influence with the native population, but their radicalism is somewhat unsettling. Moderates exist among their ranks, however, and prime minister Boydell believes that moderate trade unionism among natives can be cultivated by recognizing and working with the Natal ICU instead of constantly villifying them. Others propose the influence of the ICU can be worn down by establishing new moderate trade unions with whom the government will engage."
natal.19.a:0 "We can surely lure the ICU away from its radicalism!"
natal.19.b:0 "We should organize non-radical unions instead."
natal.20.t:0 "Recognizing a Paramount Chief"
natal.20.d:0 "Since the demise of the kingdom of Zululand, events have not fared well for the zulu monarchy. The family has merely been recognized by the government as the chiefs of the Usuthu and to make matters worse, since the death of Solomon kaDinuzulu Zulu in 1933, this throne has been disputed between his sons: Pikokwaziwayo Victor kaSolomon Zulu, Thandayiphi kaSolomon Zulu and Cyprian Bhekuzulu kaSolomon. In the meantime, the South African government had appointed Mshiyeni kaDinuzulu Zulu, Solomon's brother, as the regent of the chiefdom.\n\nThe new Natalian government's consideration is that the best defence against syndicalist infiltration among the Zulu people is to recognize a paramount chief of the Zulu nation once more to strengthen the tribal structures, but this does mean a stand will have to be taken: one of the princes' claims must be enforced in order to allow us to declare one paramount chief of all the Zulu."
natal.20.a:0 "Prince Pikokwaziwayo, as the oldest son."
natal.20.b:0 "Prince Thandayiphi, the regent's recommendation."
natal.20.c:0 "Prince Cyprian, who was designated as heir in a schoolbook."
natal.21.t:0 "Cooperation with John Dube"
natal.21.d:0 "John Langalibalele Dube is the leader of the African National Congress (ANC) in Natal, a native rights group with some similarities to the ICU, albeit much smaller. It is the avid conservatism of this man that has attracted the attention of the government: at a time when syndicalist influence among the Zulu people is growing while the descendants of the Zulu king are busy infighting for the right to the Usuthu chiefdom, Dube is seen as a possible route towards preserving the native traditional structures, forming a defence against syndicalist demagoguery. As Dube is a native rights activist, cooperation goes both ways however."
natal.21.a:0 "Let us invite him for a cup of tea!"
natal.22.t:0 "Indians in Natal"
natal.22.d:0 "Natal's asiatic community is primarily descended from Indian indentured workers who were imported to work on the sugarcane plantations in the region. Nowadays, they make up a substantial portion of the Natalian population, one larger than the white diaspora. To the annoyance of their white counterparts, many Indians have very successful small businesses that outcompete their competition. As a result of this, the white population of Natal had curtailed their civil rights long before the Natal's inclusion in the Union of South Africa.\n\nThe Asiatic community is politically aware and treating them poorly will likely result in mass actions. However, if we are to cater to them we ought to be careful, for the white electorate will likely disapprove. With the independence of Natal asserted, a policy towards these Natalian citizens needs to be formulated."
natal.22.a:0 "We need to work together more closely."
natal.22.b:0 "Surely we cannot allow them to outcompete us!"
natal.23.t:0 "Race Riots in Durban"
natal.23.d:0 "Disaster... After an Indian man allegedly hit a Zulu girl, Zulu rioters have assaulted ethnic Indians in the Indian business district of Durban. In their rage, they have started to attacking individual Indians, stoning vehicles of Indian drivers, looting Indian stores and burning Indian property. According to an informant, the Zulus are organized by troublemakers who have decided it 'is time to rid the country of Indians'.\n\nThe police is ready to follow the town council's instructions. According to the police chief intervening as soon as possible would be necessary to limit the amount of casualties to be expected."
natal.23.a:0 "Make sure it does not become a true massacre, but don't let it end too soon."

natal.24.t:0 "Asiatic Representation Council"
natal.24.d:0 "The Natal government has decided to grant the Asian diaspora in Natal a certain degree of representation. Whereas they previously held no political influence at all, an Asiatic Representation Council made up of whites will now be elected by the Asiatic population of Natal, giving them at least a degree of representation, even if Natal's whites are not prepared to share power with them on an equal basis."

natal.25.t:0 "General Elections of [GetYear]"
natal.25.d:0 "With the constitution formalized, it is time the Natalian (white) population elects a government with a mandate. The provisional independence coalition of the Union Federal Party and the Dominion Party has dissolved and the last few weeks they have been campaigning against one another. Most expect that one of those two will secure a majority, though if parliament proves hung, there is a slim chance that a coalition of the Natal Labour Party and the leftovers of the South African Party might be able to form a government instead, banishing both the supposed larger parties to the opposition. The National Party also partakes on an unambiguous reunionist platform, but they are not expected to be competitive anywhere but in Durban-North."

natal.27.t:0 "Federal Elections of [GetYear]"
natal.27.d:0 "It is time to hold our new federation's first federal elections. Much like in the Union, most of the electorate is still white, but it is most definitely different from before: large amounts of Afrikaners affiliated with the treacherous National Party, or those who fought on the Boer side during the war have been disenfranchised, making up for the demographic gap between Afrikaners and English-speaking South Africans.\nThe election is somewhat similar to those in the early days of the union, with Nicholls' Union Federal Party fulfilling the role of the English-speaking Unionists and the South African Party, now led by Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr following the retirement of general Smuts, being supported by Afrikaners, although most former Nationalists, insofar they are not disenfranchised, do not recognize themselves in the liberal path Hofmeyr is pulling the party towards."

natal.28.d:0 "'The notion that, after having defeated Afrikaner forces, the mechanics of democracy once again put the Afrikaners in power at the cost of South Africa's British population, is unacceptable.' is what the MP for Roodepoort, Charles Stallard, of the fringe Dominion Party declared. Today was supposed to be the festive assembly of the first federal parliament of South Africa, after the SAP's victory. Not so, as militias who fought for the Federal side during the Boer War occupied Cape Town's Houses of Parliament at this very day. Stallard, acting as the speaker for these rebels, directed the Governor-General directly: to safeguard the interests of the British diaspora in South Africa, parliament is to be suspended for an undetermined period and the Governor-General is to assume control of the government in a similar fashion to Australasia's situation in the 1920s, while a Dominion Party caretaker government shall assist in this task.\nThe Governor-General then stepped up and..."
natal.28.a:0 "...invoked his Emergency Powers to follow up on the call!"

natal.29.t:0 "Militias retreat from the Houses of Parliament"
natal.29.d:0 "Following the denunciation by the Governor-General, Stallard and the militias were forced to conclude that without the requested support of the crown, their attempted coup would stand no chance. The militias then surrendered and the parliamentary process was resumed as it was originally planned. Later that day, prospective prime minister Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, announced his understanding for the British concerns, and as a reconciliatory measure announced he would pardon all soldiers involved with the occupation besides those who orchestrated it, whose punishment he would instead personally commute to a maximum of five years in prison if they were to be sentenced more than that."

The same prejudices that held back such projects in South Africa are still with us in Natal however. There is fear that allowing native Natalians to be armed in this way might incite a revolt against their white officers, and many whites simply are not prepared to take the risk that we might need to fight a modernised rerun Anglo-Zulu war.

In this way, he created a coalition of Afrikaners and British progressives, which shattered the UFP despite the gerrymandered districts ensuring the British vote would be decisive.\n\nSeeing the writing on the wall with the SAP majority, and unwilling to alienate a clearly about to be enfranchised 'coloured' voter base, the UFP has decided to support the bill, while quietly assuring their constituents in Natal that they will allow this to be a step towards enfranchisement of the Indian population of Natal. The only opposition in the federal parliament comes from the hard-line segregationist Dominion Party, with colonel Stallard condemning the prime minister’s bill, claiming ‘the new states of the South African Federation are not like the provinces of the Union which can be told what to do by Pretoria; this bill great oversteps the bounds of federal authority.’ However, his objections will not stop the bill from passing.

Some in the government say we should take this settlement, as it means we will have finally achieved our independence and a continued struggle against them might be hopeless.

POLITICS_PETR_KRASNOV_DESC: "The Krasnov Clan is perhaps the most famous among the Don Cossacks, its members have been generals, officers and intellectuals, and Pyetr Krasnov was just the most recent manifestation of this heritage. Though raised as a Cossack, Krasnov is extremely well read - he holds great interest in literature and writes fiction, has studied the nations of the Far East and Africa while serving in the Life Guards Ataman Regiment, and was even an acquaintance of Tsar Nikolay II himself. Having risen to lead the Regiment, he swore fealty to the Provisional Government, but did not hold warm feelings towards it, and so chose to not save Kerensky during the October Revolution. When he arrived back to his home in the Don Host, he was elected their Ataman and announced a crusade against the revolution in the north.\n\nThe Don Cossacks would prove to be the most loyal and effective force among the South Russian Whites, and periodically received German support, which the Ataman did not forget. Once the Bolshevik revolution concluded, Krasnov returned to his Host, but the Republic in Moscow did not leave him satisfied. The Tsar was nowhere close to being restored, the Republic itself was weak, and Krasnov personally despised Kerensky. During the Kolchak Coup of 1925, he decided to strike. Supported by German arms and a clique of loyal officers, he organized his own putsch in Rostov-on-Don, moved onto the rest of the Don-Caucasian region, and cut all ties with the regime in Moscow. The Kaiser's support meant that Russia was forced to back down, although it claims the region to this day. Krasnov continues to run the clique as a personalistic regime, suppressing all of Kuban Host's calls for union with Ukraine and keeping the North Caucasian tribes down. For now..."

With a fervent belief in the restoration of the monarchy in Russia, the party seeks to uphold and promote the traditional Russian way of life, emphasizing faith, family, patriotism, and the preservation of the country's cultural heritage. The party's core values lie in the recognition of the monarchy as the preferred form of government, viewing it as a symbol of stability, tradition, and national unity. The Brothers places great value on the role of faith in society, seeing it as a guiding principle for moral and ethical conduct. Russian nationalism is another key aspect of the party's ideology, focusing on the interests of the Russian nation only. In addition, the Brotherhood strongly opposes republicanism and the legacy of the socialist ideology. They believe that the Republic has undermined traditional values, eroded national identity, and caused immense suffering for the Russian people. As such, they actively work towards countering the influence of republicanism and its effects on Russian society.§!"

DKB_ataman: "Krasnov Remains"
DKB_ataman_desc: "The Traitors, despite their best efforts have failed to overthrow Ataman Krasnov."
DKB_voennya_sdelka: "Military Deal With Germany"
DKB_voennya_sdelka_desc: "As one of the first steps in our journey for closer ties with the Kaiserreich, members of our government have suggested reaching out to Germany for aid with military matters. After all, we may soon find ourselves as the newest section of Germany's Eastern Flank, making military aid against the Sleeping Bear all but a necessity. "
DKB_german_officer: "Invite German Officers"
DKB_german_officer_desc: "As we begin the modernization of our armed forces along German lines, the first and perhaps most obvious step is to invite German officers to our nation. With this first step underway, our armed forces will soon be the envy of the Caucasus!"
DKB_ger_partner: "Partnership With Germany"
DKB_ger_partner_desc: "With our German ties closer then ever, the time has come for a formal treaty of partnership with the German Empire. While this will basically only be putting on paper what is already a reality, it is a necessary step if our relationship with Germany is too progress further."
DKB_german_nayka: "Scientific Cooperation With the Germans"
DKB_german_nayka_desc: "As we grow ever closer to Germany, the next logical step is to increase scientific cooperation with the Kasierreich. By doing this, not only will we gain access to the cutting edge of German research, but our own scientific minds that would otherwise go unnoticed by the world will have the chance to prove their intelligence!"
DKB_make_administration: "Krupp Investments"
DKB_make_administration_desc: "As we work ever closer with Germany to battle the effects of Black Monday, an interesting letter has crossed the desk of [DKB.GetLeader]. Krupp, the Germany armaments company, has formally request a large (but temporary) tax break. In change for such a break, they would be willing to substantially invest in the Don Republic. For course this comes with the risk of even more German control of our nation, but that is a small risk compared to the reward..." 
DKB_progerman_politic: "Pro-German Politics"
DKB_progerman_politic_desc: "With German agreement to aid us in rebuilding our economy following Black Monday, the time has come to finally codify what has so long been the case. Germany is our most important ally, economically, politically and militarily. It was solely due to Germany that we have been free of the Bear to our north for so long, and it shall be with Germany that we remain free!"
DKB_ger_ammo: "Import German Equipment"
DKB_ger_ammo_desc: "The armed forces of the Don Republic, with the aid of German officers, are looking more and more like the Heer by the day. However, one thing is stopping them from fully looking like their German counterparts: equipment. To rectify this, the government has approved a mass shipment of German equipment. Soon our boys will not only fight like the Germans, but will have the same guns!"
DKB_KONR: "Remove Vlasov"
DKB_KONR_desc: "The Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia is a body that has existed ever since the ill-fated Kolchak putsch. Formed by General Andrey Vlasov who supported Kolchak but was unable to flee to the Far East with the rest of the putschists but then arrived in the Don-Kuban Union. The committee has been a problem for our government ever since it's inception. However Krasnov has a plan to remove Vlasov from power then to place himself as the leader of the committee, turning them into our puppet."
DKB_ostlegonien: "Form the Ostlegionen"
DKB_ostlegonien_desc: "As our armed forces are evermore Germanized, a great problem and yet perhaps even a great solution has shown itself. All throughout the Don Republic, there are seemly countless ethnic minorities, all who, while loyal to the Republic, fear joining the army due to it's over cossackization. At the suggestion of Germany, these minorities are to be formed into the first so-called Ostlegionen, a division that will take any man, regardless of ethnicity into it's ranks."
DKB_ger_traning: "German Tactics Training"
DKB_ger_traning_desc: "With our armed forces moving ever closer to the German standred, the time has come atlast for training in German tactcis. All our efforts have led up to this, and with this completed, we will finally have a modern, German-style army!"
DKB_ROA: "Incorporate the ROA"
DKB_ROA_desc: "With the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia now firmly puppeted by the Don Republic, the time has come for the next phase of the Krasnov's plan to integrate the exiles into our Country, integrating the ROA.  The Committee has approved the integrating of the Russian Liberation Army, which now is little more than a part of our own armed forces, although bolstered by Russian defectors. Regardless, the Russian Liberation Army shall be the bulwark against Russian imperialism."
DKB_propoganda: "Propaganda"
DKB_propoganda_desc: "With the KONR and ROA quickly becoming more and more entrenched within the Don (even superseding the government on certain levels), there is one massive problem that must be addressed. Namely, the people don't view either the KONR or ROA as legitimate. They see both as an attempt by Germany to completely overtake our local government. This is simple not true! To teach the people the truth about our necessary contact and ties with Germany, the government has approved a campaign to teach the people the truth. While some will call this a propaganda campaign, they are clear wrong. We are simply teaching the truth, our truth."
DKB_new_patriot: "Gleichschaltung"
DKB_new_patriot_desc: "With the people finally accepting the truth in regards to our German allies, the German Administration present within our country has proposed a radical idea. They call it 'Gleichschaltung' or 'Coordination'. In essence, the plan would slowly begin to eat away at local institutions, the media, and even the economy to fully unite the nation under one vision. While indeed this proposal is radical and would be highly unpopular should it be discovered, the potential befit to our national stability is too good to pass up, even if it may give the Germans unprecedented control over the country."
DKB_form_base: "Rostow Militärbezirk"
DKB_form_base_desc: "With German influence even greater in the Don, our contacts within the German Heer have proposed a plan that may just change the region forever. They call it the Rostow Militärbezirk or Rostow Military District: in essence, the plan would turn the current attache into a full blown station of the Heer in Eastern Europe. While perhaps problematic and a possible sign of things to come, due to the amount of German influence within the Don, we can do nothing but smile and nod, lest the Heer turn their guns towards us and install a more friendly regime in our place."
DKB_fol_pol: "Foreign Policy"
DKB_fol_pol_desc: "With Black Monday finally behind us and the Heer fully supporting our government, the time has come to begin expanding the Don Republic to the furthest reaches of the Caucasus. The journey ahead will be hard, and much blood will be spilled, but in the end it will all be worth it."
DKB_annex_kuban: "Annex Kuban"
DKB_annex_kuban_desc: "The Kuban People's Republic has long been a thorn in the side of the Don government. With German backing, we will make short work of this thorn, at last."
DKB_annex_kalmykia: "Annex Kalmykia"
DKB_annex_kalmykia_desc: "Breaking off from us following Black Monday, the treacherous government of Kalmykia has been a target since their deceleration of independence. With aid from the Heer, there is no doubt we will be able to deal with these up starts as fast as they left the Republic."
DKB_annex_causasus: "Annex the Mountain Republic"
DKB_annex_causasus_desc: "The Mountain Republic has existed since it declared Independence from Russia following the Russian Revolution in 1917. While it was Germany that kept the Mountain Republic alive from the Russian Bear, it shall be German arms in Cossack hands that puts the Republic down."
DKB_automonic_state: "Proclaim an Autonomous State"
DKB_automonic_state_desc: "German influence can be felt on every level of our government, from the lowest tax collector to the High Command. German Marks fuel our economy, German gas drives our trucks, and German hands control the strings of power. Only one man remains to prevent total German control over the Don: Ataman Krasnov. That man will be made to bend to the German will or he will be... dealt with. And, once he is gone? The Don shall be what it was always meant to be, an outpost of the Kasierreich in the Caucuses, guarding our eastern flanks and letting the oil flow..."
DKB_dictator_ataman: "The Ataman-Dictator"
DKB_dictator_ataman_desc: "Ataman Krasnov has finally obtained total control of the Don Host. The Krug is becoming more irrelevant and with most rebel groups leaving for different countries out of fear of the Ataman, it would seem Krasnov is here to stay."
DKB_distance_ourselves_from_germany: "Distance Ourselves from Germany"
DKB_distance_ourselves_from_germany_desc: "The Actions of the German Garrison during the failed coup have proven something: they are not truly on our side. This is why we must distance ourselves from the German Empire; for our own good."
DKB_expel_the_garrison: "The Garrison Must Go!"
DKB_expel_the_garrison_desc: "The German Garrison must be explelled from the country, while we can retain good economic relations with Germany we no longer need their military "support"."
DKB_reinforce_cossacks: "Reinforce the Cossacks"
DKB_reinforce_cossacks_desc: "The Don Cossacks are the backbone of our country and with the coming end of the German Garrison we must reinforce their position for the future."
DKB_build_up_what_is_left: "Industrialize Rostov"
DKB_build_up_what_is_left_desc: "Rostov is rather poorly Industrialized for a capital city. While we could just ask German companies to invenst in us we have instead opted to build state owned factories."
DKB_armed_neutrality: "Declare Armed Neutrality"
DKB_armed_neutrality_desc: "There are many countries that would love to annex our lands and what do we say to them? Come and take it! We must build up a defence system ready to fight the coming Russian Hordes."
DKB_the_dream_is_dead: "The Dream is Dead"
DKB_the_dream_is_dead_desc: "The Dream of the Don-Kuban Union has truly been dead ever since the tragdy of 1930. It is time that we move on from that and into a new bright future for all Don Cossacks."

DKB_make_co_be: "Create Council of the Republic"
DKB_make_co_be_desc: "As we pursue the republic of our Ataman’s dreams, we must form proper accountable branches of government. By decree, the Council of the Republic has been formed. They shall be made up of the most powerful people in the nation, and with them aiding the Atamen, our Republic shall be stable."
DKB_make_duma: "Create the State Duma"
DKB_make_duma_desc: "With his rule in place, our leader, Ataman Bogaevsky, has called for the formation of a State Duma to represent the people of our lands. As we go forth, the people's voice will finally be heard! Long live the State Duma and Ataman Bogaevsky!"
DKB_project_novorossia: "Towards Free Republic!"
DKB_project_novorossia_desc: "Project Don Republic, an ambitious project to bring Russia and the Don-Kuban closer, has been proposed, and now it is ready to become a reality. We will solidify our place within the Russian world and perhaps even afford us new opportunities for prosperity in the future..."
DKB_make_army: "Create a new Don Army"
DKB_make_army_desc: "With the advent of a new state, perhaps it is also time for a new army. The old army of Don-Kuban was a rag-tag force of hardened horsemen who were effective fighters in their time but sadly could not stand up to the forces of modernity. It is time for change."
DKB_narod_ukraine: "Give Residence Permit for Ukrainians"
DKB_narod_ukraine_desc: "Ukrainians, belonging to one of the largest ethnic groups in our country, have protested for years at the lack of residence permits for their brethren in our country. The size of this group means they carry significant influence, but this is not the only reason why we should consider granting residence permits to Ukrainians. Doing so would also foster better relations with our western neighbor Ukraine, and so, a decision must be made."
DKB_izgnati_german: "Expel German Delegations"
DKB_izgnati_german_desc: "The meddling Germans have caused nothing but trouble for us in the Don-Kuban. Now that we have thrown off their influence somewhat, perhaps it is time that we take more decisive action to flush them out."
DKB_con: "Create a Constitution"
DKB_con_desc: "The hallmark of a modern state is the presence of a constitution, or at least this is the argument of many of our more democratic-leaning politicians. Perhaps they are right: by enshrining our laws and beliefs into a document, it will stand the test of time, and so will we."
DKB_interte: "Demand Formal Recognition"
DKB_interte_desc: "Our state may be on the rise, but we have suffered from an acute lack of recognition on the international stage. Barely anyone will even look our way, much less speak to our diplomats or reply to our messages. Even more important than the objective of finding allies is the simple objective of finding recognition. Once we do this, the hardest task will be behind us, and we can begin trading again."
DKB_project_done: "Project Completed"
DKB_project_done_desc: "We have finally witnessed the completion of the Don Republic project. Though it was neither easy not cheap, we have carved a new place for ourselves in the world, and we shall march into the future with high hopes that it is a new day for our people."
DKB_kuban_quest: "Kuban Question"
DKB_kuban_quest_desc: "It is time to reunite with our brothers in the Kuban host. Though they split from us in the chaos of Krasnov's Putsch, they are still our brothers, and we believe we can do what is necessary to bring them back into the fold."
DKB_caucasus_quest: "Caucasian Question"
DKB_caucasus_quest_desc: "The Caucasian region is an important one. The area has shielded our people from southern invaders for thousands of years, and gaining control of it would give us a crucial access point between Russia and the Middle East. Perhaps more importantly, it would give us a better grip on the oil trade..."
DKB_kalmykian_quest: "Kalmyk Question"
DKB_kalmykian_quest_desc: "The Kalmyks, though small in number, are no less our brothers than any other group in the region. In fact, we have held this area for years beyond count, and though it separated from us in more recent times, it is time for us to decide how to approach them."
DKB_claim_tsargrad: "Restore 1918 Borders"
DKB_claim_tsargrad_desc: "Tsaritsyn is perhaps the most important city of southern Russia. Its strategic position and industrial capacity are just two of the many factors making it a must-have city for us. However, such a desire raises this question: how will we get our hands on it?"
DKB_claim_donbass: "Claim Donbass and Crimea"
DKB_claim_donbass_desc: "Donbass is a region that has seen many empires come and go, but through it all, they have remained our kin, both in body and in spirit. If we reunite with our brothers in this region, we will be one step closer to achieving our potential as a state, and both areas will be stronger as a result."
DKB_great_novorossia: "Greater Don"
DKB_great_novorossia_desc: "Greater Don, the dream of all true Caucasians, Cossacks, and other peoples who call this region their home. We can only hope to fend off external invasion through unification of all our disparate peoples. Having achieved this goal, perhaps we will be safe after all..."


DKB_united_cossack_host: "Restore the Don-Kuban Union!"
DKB_united_cossack_host_desc: "Kuban, Don, Terek; we were once divided, but no more! We are a united Cossack host once again, and we’ll be damned if we allow anyone to divide us again! Our goals are clear and we shall pursue them! Long live the Cossack People of our Nation!"
DKB_uniting_cossacks: "Uniting Cossacks"
DKB_uniting_cossacks_desc: "We are a divided people, Cossacks from the Don, the Kuban and the Terek rivers. Now, as the accursed Muscovites come ever slower towards seeking to strip us of everything we have gained in the past decades, we must act! Our freedoms, our sovereignty, EVERYTHING, is under threat! It is time to unite and standfast as a single people, readied for the Muscovite hordes! "

DKB_ties_with_kuban: "Ties With the Kuban Host"
DKB_ties_with_kuban_desc: "Our brothers in the Kuban Host split off from us in the aftermath of Krasnov’s putsch during the Chaos of the Admiral’s power grab. We have left each other alone for years, but now we must join hands and unite the region! We must defend ourselves from the Muscovite menace!"

DKB_ties_with_astrakhan: "Ties With the Astrakhan Host"
DKB_ties_with_astrakhan_desc: "Ours brothers across the border, the Astrakhan Host. During the putsch they did not side with, but we can forgive that. As the Muscovites come for us they shall soon realize joining with us is the only option for the various Cossack people!"

DKB_ties_with_terek: "Ties With the Terek Host"
DKB_ties_with_terek_desc: "The Terek Cossacks our brothers down in the Mountain Republic. During the chaos they split off from the Union and joined the Muslim People there. Now with the Muscovites coming we shall call for unity across the steppe and mountains."

DKB_deal_with_khanate_desc: "The Turkic people of the land are in our way, and it seems like they will most likely stay in our way. Because of this, we are planning to forcibly remove them through any means necessary. After this, we shall be the masters of the Steppes!"

DKB_Restore_The_Republic_desc: "One of the few things Kerensky did right was give the people of the land the great gift of democracy.

DKB_Transitional_Military_Government_desc: "As we attempt to turn Russia into the greatest democracy ever known: our needs have reached a crossroad.

DKB_Fate_Of_Left_Parties_desc: "With the restoration of a truly democratic system seemingly on the verge of becoming a reality once again, the question of what to do with the various fringe leftist parties has come into consideration. The majority of people within the transitional authority believe that these parties should be banned, as it was these very parties that plunged Russia into civil war a short twenty years ago. A small minority, possibly Reds themselves, hold that we should allow these parties to exist freely. After all, don't we want to be a truly free Russia?"
DKB_Fate_Of_Right_Parties: "Fate of Far-Right Parties"
DKB_Fate_Of_Right_Parties_desc: "With the restoration of a truly democratic system seemingly on the verge of becoming a reality once again, the question of what to do with the various fringe Rightist parties has come into the opening. Unlike with the Leftists, the transitional authority is highly divided on the so-called Rightist question. Some wish to see the parties banned, as they constitute a major threat to democracy and can easily sway the masses with sweet sounding promises that would see democracy itself destroyed, or so they claim. Others wish to allow the Rightist parties to freely operate, as that is their right in a truly democratic society. Others support the allowance of them, as they could help form a bulwark against a possibly resurgent radical left. Regardless, the decision must be made."

DKB_Cossack_Representation_In_The_Parliament_desc: "With our decision to once more turn Russia into a democracy, the Cossack Hosts have righted a long standing wrong. Per the new constitution, at least 15% of the new Duma must be directly elected by the various Cossack Hosts. While some may decry this move as petty, to us Cossacks, the liberators of Russia, this move is the only way to ensure we are never again pushed out of Russian politics again. "
DKB_Democracy_Under_Guidance: "Democracy Under Guidance"
DKB_Democracy_Under_Guidance_desc: "What was the major problem of the Petrograd Regime? It was unfettered democracy, allowing any member of the Russian rabble to elect anyone they wanted into power. While the Senate did a lot to prevent more radical changes from being undertaken, it was not enough. We can agree that democracy is indeed a good thing, but it must have its limits. We cannot allow the people to elect men who would do away with or pervert the very concept of being Russian! To this end, various safeguards and loopholes shall be installed into our new Russian Republic. These safeguards and loopholes will allow the right people to... guide the Russian democratic process, for the betterment of all."
DKB_National_Elections: "National Elections"
DKB_National_Elections_desc: "With reconstruction now nearing completion, at least politically, the time has come to call for nationwide elections.

DKB_Deal_With_Trade_Unions: "Deal With Trade Unions"
DKB_Deal_With_Trade_Unions_desc: "As we begin to rebuild Russia, both polically and materially, the age-old question of Trade Unions has once more been raised. Under the Petrograd Regime, Trade Unions were allowed to exist freely, with more radical unions being banned. With the victory of the United Cossack Host over Russia, many are calling for all unions within the nation to be placed under state control, to prevent radicalization. Others still wish for us to maintain the policy of Kerensky and allow Unions to exist freely. While not the most pressing of issues, the union question is one that must be answered if we wish to be seen as the rightful Russian government."
DKB_Electrification_Programme: "Electrification Program"
DKB_Electrification_Programme_desc: "Electricity is a wonderful thing. It powers everything from factories to radios, oil refineries to the lights at one's local church on a stormy night. To say that most Russians lack this increasingly most basic of resources is an understatement. While major cities are no stranger to electricity(although a few lost this luxury during our war with the Petrograd regime), the further one goes into the interior, the further one goes back in time. If we want Russia to be a modern nation, we must bring electricity to every single Russian we can. What better opportunity than during reconstruction?"
DKB_Business_Subdidies: "Business Subsidies"
DKB_Business_Subdidies_desc: "Russia is an industrial backwater, there is no way around that. Even before the Civil War that burnt the industrial heartland to dust, and even before our own recent war, Russia has lacked an acute business class. With reconstruction now ongoing, the chance to finally build up the Russian economy has presented itself. With a series of tax breaks and general subsides, we may finally be able to entice business to settle in Russia."
DKB_Rebuild_Industry: "Rebuild Industry"
DKB_Rebuild_Industry_desc: "Russian industry, or the lack thereof, has long made us the laughing stock of Europe. The so-called 'reforms' of Kerensky did not help this situation, and neither did our glorious conquest of the Russian state. With our rule still unstable, a concentrated effort to restore and rebuild Russia's industry could do nothing but help us in our efforts to legitimize our rule of the vast plains of Russia."
DKB_Rebuild_Agriculture: "Rebuild Agriculture"
DKB_Rebuild_Agriculture_desc: "The dismal state of agriculture in Russia is, to say the least, devastating, and our conquest did nothing to help.

DKB_Naval_Industry: "Naval Industry"
DKB_Naval_Industry_desc: "Though we do not border an ocean, much of our land lies on the coast of either the Black Sea or the Caspian Sea.

DKB_Rebuild_Railroads: "Rebuild Railroads"
DKB_Rebuild_Railroads_desc: "Since the end of the Russian Civil War, our railroads have remained isolated, damaged, and neglected.

DKB_Adopt_The_Doctrine_Of_Cossack_Tactics_desc: "Our armies have used Cossack tactics for centuries; in fact, our army has been mostly Cossacks.

DKB_New_Officer_School: "New Officer School"

DKB_Improve_The_Artillery: "Improve the Artillery"
DKB_Improve_The_Artillery_desc: "The state of artillery in our army is lackluster at best, but with the right attention (or investment), we can restore this part of our army to its rightful place.

DKB_Motorize_The_Cossacks: "Motorize the Cossacks"
DKB_Motorize_The_Cossacks_desc: "For millennia, the horses of the steppes have served as more than military tools: they have been a way of life for our people. Now though, the era of the horse in warfare is coming to an end. Instead, they have been increasingly replaced with motorized vehicles that only need fuel to run. It time for us to jump on this band wagon as well." 
DKB_Engineer_Corps: "Engineer Corps"
DKB_Engineer_Corps_desc: "The steppes of Don-Kuban are stereotyped as being flat, yet this hides the fact that it is a mountainous region, with forests, coastlines, and even arid semi-desert areas. We must employ men who can navigate the terrain and, more importantly, help our army to do so, so that we can more effectively defend our own turf and perhaps someday, even expand beyond it..."
DKB_Ural_Tanks: "Ural Tanks"
DKB_Ural_Tanks_desc: "The Ural tank plants are a source of much of our nation's armored vehicles, both in terms of production and research.

DKB_All_The_Power_To_Tsar: "Return of Tsarist Autocracy"
DKB_All_The_Power_To_Tsar_desc: "We must move beyond the need for the Cossacks to dominate the government. They cannot do so alone; we need the Tsar to lead Russia, and as more than a figurehead. The Tsar must be invested with the sort of power the position held before the Weltkrieg."

DKB_Devoted_Subjects: "Devoted Subjects"
DKB_Devoted_Subjects_desc: "One of the pillars of the Russian state and now ours is the existence of loyal subjects.

DKB_Expand_Our_Influence_In_The_Balkans_desc: "The Balkans was once our stomping grounds, a place where we had significant influence. Though it was always in competition with powers such as the Ottomans or the Austro-Hungarians, it could be said that we were the leading Orthodox nation in the world, and that our protective embrace guaranteed the independence of the Balkan states.

DKB_Join_Soviet_Russia: "Join Socialist Russia"
DKB_Join_Soviet_Russia_desc: "Though the various people of the Don Republic are a proud and noble group, there is no denying our current state of affairs. We are a small, isolated Socialist nation with a fragile economy and struggling military, while just to the North lies the largest Socialist nation on Earth. We must accept this reality and meet with our brothers in Moscow at once with open arms to discuss our need to unite them. With Russia on its way towards socialist transformation, our cooperation is only natural, and so we must move forward as brothers in Socialism to foster a better future for our people, together."

It is time for us to proclaim the new Russian Socialist Republic, a rightful successor to the one lost in the chaos of Russian Civil War."
DKB_De_Cossackisation: "Decossackization"
DKB_De_Cossackisation_desc: "The majority of land and means of production in our republic belong to the Cossacks. They are wealthy, influential, and ever-present in Don life as they exploit the peasants. Their reputation in more recent years has also declined greatly due to their ties to the Kaissereich and accusations of being mere German puppets. We need to start the process of Decossackization as soon as possible, so that power may finally rest within the hands of the proletariat."

DKB_Cooperate_With_Red_Cossacks_desc: "While the process of Decossackization is needed, there are plenty of so-called 'Red Cossacks': courageous veterans of the Civil War who fought for the Reds. They are fewer in number than their White-aligned brethren but have proven themselves in the fires of war as skillful officers willing to help the proletariat. Perhaps it would be easier for us to stabilize the nation with their support."

We shall begin to draft regular citizens into certain workfields so as to better meet the needs of the state as each new need arises, while also mobilizing parts of our inactive military personnel to function as ‘labour armies’. These armies will go where the state needs them, carrying out any task the proletariat’s will exerts on them."
DKB_Mechanize_Agriculture: "Agricultural Mechanization"
DKB_Mechanize_Agriculture_desc: "Our country is still mostly agricultural with many peasants still working in the field. Despite this reliance on agriculture, much of our farmland remains stuck in the stone age, using tools and techniques expected of serfs, but not of true proletarians.

DKB_The_Private_Property_Question_desc: "While the idea of private property should be totally banned in our country, perhaps we should not nationalize everything so rashly.

DKB_Nationalize_Neve_desc: "The iron and steel plant in Taganrog is one of the largest factories in our country. It was founded in 1896 by "Boiler Plant Albert Nev, Wilde & Co" with the active participation of Albert Nève, an affluent Belgian industrialist. On March 15, 1918, the Taganrog Plant was nationalized, but soon after the end of the Civil War, it again was privatized by Nève. It's time to nationalize the plant once and for all and make sure that any single penny, made by the proletariat, stays in our country, and that every inch of steel processed here goes to the state and not to foreign markets."

DKB_The_Role_Of_The_Chairman_desc: "We need to choose if Budyonny's power should be limited by other political institutions or not.

DKB_Don_Red_Army_desc: "We must go with a more traditional and professional army - we will be sure that our borders are always protected and that the conscription is always enough to fight while all men will receive amble training under a rigid officer caste.

DKB_Revolution_In_Central_Asia_desc: "Central Asia is the rightful territory of any unified Russian State, first falling sway to our nation’s will in the 19th century.

DKB_The_Eastern_Threat_desc: "To the East lies the old foe of Russia: the Japanese Empire. Shocking the world in their victory over the Tsarist regime of old, they have forever since proven to be an imposing and ever-present rival to Russian ambitions in the East.

DKB_Fear_and_Terror_desc: "The best anti-partisan weapon is the weapon of terror. Cruelty commands respect. They may hate us, but we do not ask for their love, only their fear."
DKB_Expand_the_SB: "Expand the SB"
DKB_Expand_the_SB_desc: "The Sicherheitbrigaden have been key to our rise to power. However, their numbers are far below what you would expect from the main paramilitary branch of our regime. Therefore, we will carry out a recruitment campaign to bolster our forces and cement our military power."
DKB_A_Loyal_Heer: "Ensure Total Loyalty"
DKB_A_Loyal_Heer_desc: "There are many in our government who still believe resistance is an option. Ranging from old cossack leaders to more disloyal elements of von Pannwitz’s cliques to minor Ostlegionnen members, they all have in one way or another acted against our wishes. It is time to remind them who it is they serve. To begin with, we shall revive the old Roman practice of decimation... and then we’ll improvise."
DKB_Labor_Camps: "Finish Up the Last Rebels"
DKB_Labor_Camps_desc: "Finally the last of the Russian rebels are being mopped up, Stability is soon to return to the east."
DKB_Drag_Nach_Osten: "Drive to the East"
DKB_Drag_Nach_Osten_desc: "The "Drive to the East" or "Drang Nach Osten" is the idea that the German people have always felt an instinctive need to travel east, to colonise these prime and plentiful lands, from as far back as the Middle Ages and the Teutonic Conquests of the Baltic. While many oppose it, our government has decided to promote the idea and help attract and settle willing migrants from the fatherland. However, this is nothing but a private venture and we have no official support from the Berlin Government, which will greatly slow down our efforts."
DKB_the_Siberian_Plan: "The Siberian Plan"
DKB_the_Siberian_Plan_desc: "If we are to continue our plan of eastern colonisation, we must first clear these lands out of their native populations to make space for our German settlers. Therefore, all those who are unwilling to undergo germanisation will be sent to a new home in Siberia, wether they like it or not. However, the sheer logistical endeavour that this encompasses makes us rely mostly on voluntary migrations following (false) promises of better treatment and conditions beyond the Urals, at least for now."
DKB_Establish_the_Siberian_Autonomy: "Establish the Siberian Autonomy"
DKB_Establish_the_Siberian_Autonomy_desc: "It is no secret the lands beyond the Urals are nothing short of a cold wasteland, where no sane man would want to live. That is also the case for our german settlers, making it utterly useless to us. As such, it will be put under the jurisdiction of the collaborator Kaminski as an autonomous zone, also allowing us to free valuable men and resources to be distributed elsewhere."
DKB_A_Meeting_with_the_Kaiser: "A Meeting with the Kaiser"
DKB_A_Meeting_with_the_Kaiser_desc: "Despite our best efforts and the great steps we have taken towards our final goal, the sad truth is that we simply lack the necessary resources to complete our mission. However, Generalgouverneur von Leeb has been able to request an audience with the Kaiser to hopefully convince him to grant us official support, funds and legions of enthusiastic settlers that will allow us to build a new future for Germany, a future in the East."
DKB_Prepare_For_the_Long_Game: "Prepare for the Long Game"
DKB_Prepare_For_the_Long_Game_desc: "Unfortunately, our meeting with the Kaiser has yielded... less than desired results, and we are once again set back in our goal. But this is not the end. This forces us to adopt a new strategy, to build enough allies and connections back home so that next time we ask we cannot be refused. We shall fulfil our destiny, It is only a matter of time."
DKB_We_Are_Coming_Home: "We Are Coming Home"
DKB_We_Are_Coming_Home_desc: "If the Kaiser thought he could simply insult us and our glorious mission, then he was wrong. It’s clear now that the Kaiser has not the best interest of Germany in mind and is too scared to do what must be done to lead Germany to greatness. We will show him the errors of his ways by force. Truth is, the game was rigged from the start. We are coming home."
DKB_Wirtschaftsreformplan: "Wirtschaftsreformplan"
DKB_Wirtschaftsreformplan_desc: "In order to help integrate the Russian economy with the Reich and develop it along the lines of the German one, our economic advisors have drafted a the Wirtschaftsreformplan or Economic Reform Plan. It will also help rebuild the great damage war has done to these lands, hopefully before we become too much of a burden on the rest of Mitteleuropa..."
DKB_fate_of_unions_ger: "Fate of the Unions"
DKB_fate_of_unions_ger_desc: "Despite Trade Unions being officially outlawed, there has been much demand for them from our population, be it in one way or another. This has caused quite the controversy within our government and it is time to deal with this issue once and for all."
DKB_Fate_of_Russian_Industries: "Fate of Russian Industries"
DKB_Fate_of_Russian_Industries_desc: "Another great in our government is that of wether the old Russian industries and conglomerates should be allowed to continue operating or be put under our control. We must resolve this as soon as possible before it becomes an even bigger hassle."
DKB_Encourage_Entrepreneurship_Ger: "Encourage Entrepreneurship"
DKB_Encourage_Entrepreneurship_Ger_desc: "Many of the German migrants we have invited to settle here have done so escaping from the crisis of Black Monday, which left them without any opportunities back home. It is only right that we support and promote any efforts to establish new german business in the region and make the troubles of resettlement worth it."

DKB_An_aviation_industry: "Our Own Aviation Industry"
DKB_An_aviation_industry_desc: "To the surprise of many, our bet on local entrepreneurship has paid off, as a small motors business founded by a young engineer has quickly grown into a fast growing aircraft producer. We will support this flourishing enterprise and help these planes take flight, showing the world that in the East you can really start anew."
DKB_Invite_Krupp: "Monopoly Rights to German Companies"
DKB_Invite_Krupp_desc: "There exist many companies at home that have for years seen Russia with ravenous eyes, waiting for the opportunity to exploit its vast resources and manpower for themselves. As we now control these lands, it is a perfect opportunity to fulfil these wishes, granting us new allies back home and further integrating our economies."
DKB_Krupp_Military_Plants: "Krupp Military Plants"
DKB_Krupp_Military_Plants_desc: "Out of all the invited companies, Krupp has been the one most keen on cooperation, having offered us to fund the construction of great military plants operated by Russian labourers and German overseers to produce weapons to arm ourselves and not have to rely as much on material support from the Fatherland. It’s an opportunity we simply cannot let pass."

DKB_Establish_a_German_University: "Establish a German University"
DKB_Establish_a_German_University_desc: "If we are to develop the untamed East we will require armies not of soldiers but of intellectuals, engineers and other such educated men who will shape our future. For the purpose of educating this future generation the Neu Berlin German Unniversity will be established in Wolgaburg. Designed by the architect Albert Speer, it will prove to be a marvel of German engineering and a shining beacon of knowledge and culture in the East."
DKB_Create_The_Ostdeutsche_Reichsbank: "The Ostdeutsche Reichsbank"
DKB_Create_The_Ostdeutsche_Reichsbank_desc: "After much popular demand, it has been decided that a new East German Bank will be created for the local german population and our own government to use. Hopefully, it will help solve any financial trouble we and our people face in the future."
DKB_Use_the_Cossacks: "Use the Cossacks"
DKB_Use_the_Cossacks_desc: "Despite our attempts to placate the Russians with promises of a restoration of Tsarist rule, many are still in open rebellion to our rule.

DKB_Destory_the_KONR_desc: "The Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia has existed in a state of limbo ever since the death of it's leader Andrey Vlasov. We will put the final nail in it's coffin. This republican organization and all those associated with, such as General Kaminski must be dealt with soon."
DKB_Look_For_Allies: "Look for Allies"
DKB_Look_For_Allies_desc: "We have very few allies and many enemies, this is a truth we must accept. However we can change this by making alliances with various Russian Monarchist Movements and leaders to ensure the future stability of our Empire."

DKB_The_Rightful_Tsar_desc: "Wilhelm II was the Cousin of the last legitimate Tsar of Russia, Nicholas II and while Wilhelm may not be the first in line, he has clearly proven his worth as a monarch and will surely lead the Russian Empire to greatness. Or at least that's what we are going to get the newspapers to print."

DKB_The_Cossack_Guard_desc: "The Cossacks under the leadership of Von Pannwitz have proved to be a valuable asset to our eastern armies. As a reward, they will be reorganised into an elite Royal Guard that will act in accordance to the Kaiser’s wishes and protect him and the country from any who would dare harm them."
DKB_All_Power_to_the_Junkers: "All Power to the Junkers"
DKB_All_Power_to_the_Junkers_desc: "Despite our promises to restore some amount of self rule to the Russians following the coronation, the Prussian Junkers given noble titles have demanded we give them the regins of power. Fighting them would be foolish, so we have no choice but to accept."
DKB_Seize_Land_for_Junkers: "Seize Russian Land"

DKB_The_New_Russian_Noblity_desc: "The new German Nobility class has grown much in power however the Nobility's position is still not quite as secure as we would like. We shall begin creating laws that will entrench the Nobility to ensure that none can ever threaten."

DKB_Send_in_the_Heer_desc: "The Russian people are still ripe with unrest but we have a simple solution to liquidate this problem, send in the Heer! A soldier on every street, a machine gun in every other window. If we can not rule by being loved, we shall rule by fear!"

DKB_An_Eternal_Martial_Law_desc: "Our attempts to liquidate the unrest so far have been successful however there is still much to be done. For now we shall inact martial law, any and all unrest will put down with extreme prejudice."
DKB_The_Figurehead_Zar: "A Figurehead Emperor"
DKB_The_Figurehead_Zar_desc: "Despite the fact we are an absolute monarchy, the Kaiser has begun growing more and more distant from Russian Politics, even more so than normally. This has effectively made him into a figurehead for the Junker Regime, which is perfect. While the Kaiser rules in Berlin we shall rule in the East away from the Kaiser's watchful eye."
DKB_Dictatorship_of_the_Junkers: "Dictatorship of the Junkers"
DKB_Dictatorship_of_the_Junkers_desc: "A New Dawn is coming over Russia, with a feeling that hasn't been felt for years, Stability.

DKB_A_Russian_Reichstag: "An All-Russian Diet"
DKB_A_Russian_Reichstag_desc: "We promised to restore self rule to the Russian people following the coronation, and while some may think this is a poor idea, it is exactly what we need to bring Russia into the modern age. Our new Government is meant to be based off of the German one, and to do that we must first create an All-Russian Reichstag."
DKB_Restore_The_Police: "Restore the Police"
DKB_Restore_The_Police_desc: "Following the conquest of Russia any form of Police force dissolved and was replaced by Military Rule, this is no way to rule a country. We shall restore the Russian Police Force, who will ensure that law and order is once again brought to the Motherland."
DKB_The_Federal_Model: "The Federal Tsardom"
DKB_The_Federal_Model_desc: "Russia is a vast land, full of many peoples and cultures. To govern it in centralized manner would be incompetent, so we will copy the German Federal System as the basis of the new Russian Government."

DKB_A_Proper_Legal_System: "A German Legal System"
DKB_A_Proper_Legal_System_desc: "Russia's legal system is far too outdated. We must modernize it by copying the German Legal System, which is sure to bring it into the Modern Age."
DKB_Abdication: "Abdication?"
DKB_Abdication_desc: "To say that the Tsar has grown distant from Russian Politics would be an understatement, and many have begun calling for Wilhelm's Abdication in favor of a proper Romanov Tsar. In the end this decision is in Wilhelm's hands, and we await his answer."

DKB_Import_German_Culture: "Import German Culture"
DKB_Import_German_Culture_desc: "It is the belief of many that the population of Russia is... backwards to say the least, at least in comparison to the rest of Europe. Of course this is untrue, but it would not hurt to perhaps bring over some aspects of “western” culture, particularly the german one, in order to better integrate Russia with the rest of the continent."
DKB_Invite_German_Companies: "Invite German Companies"
DKB_Invite_German_Companies_desc: "The lands of our new Kaiserreich are full of new opportunities and possibilities our companies back home could invest in. Therefore, we will formally invite them so they have an easier time helping us develop this vast nation."
DKB_Integration_within_Mitteleuropa: "Mitteleuropa Economic Integration"
DKB_Integration_within_Mitteleuropa_desc: "Despite many efforts throughout the decades, Russia has never been fully integrated into the economic apparatus that is Europe, particularly the Economic Bloc of Mitteleuropa. However, we are now in a perfect position to attempt this once again, something we must begin immediately for the economic prosperity of all."
DKB_German_Inspired_institutions: "German Inspired Institutions"
DKB_German_Inspired_institutions_desc: "As Russia is made anew, the institutions of Old must be reformed and replaced if we are to modernise.

DKB_Reforged_In_Blood_and_Iron_desc: "As we speak, history is being made. Through war, sacrifice and the sweat and blood of many, the Russia has been reforged into a modern and developed state. And although there still remains much to be done, we can rest knowing that, thanks to our guidance, a bright and prosperous future awaits this glorious nation."
DKB_The_Grand_Conference: "The Smolensk Conference"
DKB_The_Grand_Conference_desc: "As we have taken the mantle of a New Russia, so have we inherited many of it’s territorial claims. However, it is impossible for us to interfere with the wishes of the Fatherland regarding the Eastern States. Therefore, we will organise a great Conference in Smolensk to hopefully negotiate the incorporation of former Russian territory back to where it belongs."

#Vlasov
DKB_KONR_in_Power: "The Vlasov Affair"
DKB_KONR_in_Power_desc: "Today, Andrei Vlasov has made his move. Angered at the vassalation to Germany pursued by the German Garrison Vlasov has rallied the Cossacks behind him. The Cossacks struck first, capturing a convoy von Pannwitz was supposed to be travelling in as ROA troops ambushed German troops across the country, seizing cities and other vital areas. While Pannwitz slipped through our fingers due to bad intel, the Don is firmly under our control. He has little choice than to scamper back to Germany with his tail between his legs. Already we have begun to move to secure our rule but most Russians, regardless of their position on the ROA specifically, are happy to have Russians ruling them rather than Germans."
DKB_Rostov_Manifesto: "Rostov Manifesto"
DKB_Rostov_Manifesto_desc: "Today Vlasov and the Governing Council of the ROA has published the Rostov Manifesto. The Manifesto, in so many words, declares the ROA’s aim to revive Russia and condemns the regimes in Berlin and Tokyo for tearing away their fiefdoms while simultaneously condemning the regime in Petrograd for doing nothing to take them back. They go on to swear that after they seize Russia they will not stop until they have united all of Russia from the Polish frontier to Vladivostok. After this liberation is complete the ROA promises freedoms untold to the Russian people, freedoms they say all people deserve. This fiery message has been met with guffaws in the halls of power across the world as there is no way a puny nation like the Don could achieve such lofty goals. Vlasov cannot wait to prove them wrong."
DKB_Sideline_the_Cossacks: "Sideline the Cossacks"
DKB_Sideline_the_Cossacks_desc: "While the Cossacks were critical in taking power, their continued power in our state is a danger to the ROA. If left alone they could form a formidable and potentially unassailable haven for dissidents. To reduce their power we shall begin a grand shuffling of the administration, moving ROA loyalists into key positions while moving Cossacks out of power or into less powerful positions. If done right the Cossacks will not be a problem any more. If done right."
DKB_A_Deal_for_Autonomy: "A Deal for Autonomy"
DKB_A_Deal_for_Autonomy_desc: "The Cossack Problem is a preeminent one. Their power is undeniable but their loyalty is also rather apparent. However, to keep them in power like this would only invite disaster. However, their power makes an all out assault on them dangerous so, we shall instead approach them with a deal. We shall set aside some land in the Don, with promises of larger grants on the Steppe after we retake it, if they agree to step aside."
DKB_Crush_the_DNSP: "Crush the DNSP"
DKB_Crush_the_DNSP_desc: "While the Syndicalist attempted coup allowed von Pannwitz and then ourselves to take control, their existence can no longer be tolerated. They will never accept our rule and don't love Russia like we do. Instead they bow to their masters in Paris and London. If they are allowed to continue then they would only cause us trouble. So, upon Vlasov’s orders, we will launch raids on known safehouses across the Don to round up as many of them as possible and drive those who are left underground."
DKB_Martial_Law: "Stability Through Martial Law"
DKB_Martial_Law_desc: "Despite our hard work the situation remains dangerously unstable. To remedy the situation Vlasov has declared martial law for the foreseeable future. This is but a formality as in many areas of the Don the military has long been the sole source of authority since our takeover. However, with this proclamation, which also retroactively instituted military court rulings handed down before Martial Law was declared, we have made another important step towards total internal security."
DKB_the_Committee_Entrenched: "The Committee Entrenched"
DKB_the_Committee_Entrenched_desc: "The Cossacks remain in their stables, the Syndicalists scurry underground like the rats they are, the Atmanites have given up their foolish attempts to remove us and finally the Don is quiet. After much struggle and bloodshed the people have come to accept our rule even if they don't agree with us. In response some have asked Vlasov to order the relaxation of some of the most severe punishments instituted by the Military but Vlasov is reluctant. Just one broken finger can cripple a fist."
DKB_Peoples_Liberation: "The People's Liberation Looms"
DKB_Peoples_Liberation_desc: "The Ataman aspired to little outside his holdings and as such the people are content with what they have. They do not see themselves as Russians so much as Donyaks. This is simply unacceptable. These people are Russians by blood and by birth and they must fight to take their homeland back from the Petrograd usurpers. A massive propaganda campaign will be begun to rile the dormant Russian nationalism within all the people in our nation. Sufficiently enraged, even a single man can kill a hundred."
DKB_ROA_Propaganda: "ROA Propaganda"
DKB_ROA_Propaganda_desc: "The people must know who their saviors are. They must know that if they wish to achieve anything more than their present, meager existence they must join us. To that end we shall begin a massive propaganda campaign to reach all corners of the land espousing the greatness of the ROA’s mission. We will also set up more ROA recruiting centers across the nation to allow for more and more patriots to join us."
DKB_Lighten_Restrictions: "Lighten Internal Restrictions"
DKB_Lighten_Restrictions_desc: "With our nation secure and the people finally supporting us materially as well as mentally we can finally rest easy. In a speech in Rostov Vlasov has announced the lifting of the draconian Martial Law that has been draped over the nation. This was met with cheers by the peasantry who had quickly tired of the practice. Vlasov has also set about restoring some key freedoms promised in the Rostov Manifesto like freedom of speech and press. His more radical advisors warn him against this as they fear it would only breed dissent but Vlasov is committed."
DKB_Economic_Recovery_Plan: "Reconstruct the Shattered Economy"
DKB_Economic_Recovery_Plan_desc: "The Don economy is still in shambles.The brief period of musical chairs in political leadership combined with Black Monday has left the economy barely working and having completely broken down in some rural areas. To further prove himself as the more legitimate ruler of Russia Vlasov has decided the time has come to finally address the sagging economy."
DKB_ROA_Factories: "Munitions Plants Along the Don"
DKB_ROA_Factories_desc: "To take on the Great Beast we must have the munitions to do so. To do this Vlasov has authorized the opening of dozens of munitions plants across the country of varying size. Most are rather small scale operations befitting our lack of industrialization, but we still need every bullet and gun they can churn out."
DKB_Take_Notes_from_Solidarism: "Take Notes from Solidarism"
DKB_Take_Notes_from_Solidarism_desc: "Solidarism, or in more general terms the advocacy of worker and capitalist solidarity, is a double edged sword. Left totally unchecked capitalism is undeniably bad as it only breeds resentment from the worker and causes social upheaval. However, bowing to the worker entirely is Syndicalism. Not to mention that Solidarism itself is not all that popular within the Don. That is why Vlasov has begun to adopt parts of Solidarism into his own governing ethos while not fully committing so as to keep himself from alienating any potentially useful allies."
DKB_Begin_Industrialization: "Stoke the Fires of Industry"
DKB_Begin_Industrialization_desc: "To fight Russia, a nation many times more powerful than our own, in our present state would only mean defeat. We are still a rural nation with few factories and those that do exist are miniscule compared to the complexes in Moscow or the Urals. If we are to fight and beat the Petrograd Regime we must launch a massive industrialization campaign to finally drag this backwards land into the modern age. It won't be easy, but what is easy these days?"
DKB_Economic_Recovery: "Emerging from the Economic Pit"
DKB_Economic_Recovery_desc: "After reviewing the numbers several times we have come to an undeniable conclusion. Black Monday is over, we have recovered and even surpassed our previous industrial and economic levels. While our policies were radical we now have definitive proof they paid off in the long run, big time and now we can devote all of our energies to other matters."
DKB_Prepare_to_Expand_vlasov: "Toiling Towards the Liberation"
DKB_Prepare_to_Expand_vlasov_desc: "While the Don Republic is a healthy base of operations, its still not enough. If we are to march into Petrograd we will need much more than what the Don can offer us. That is why Vlasov and the Committee has authorized the military to begin plans to invade our neighbors in the Caucuses. WIth the region consolidated not only will we be able to harness all of their might as a single clenched fist to beat Petrograd, but we will be safe from any attacks from our rear."
DKB_Liberate_Kuban: "Liberate Kuban"
DKB_Liberate_Kuban_desc: " The Kuban has always been friendly to Ukraine and to Petrograd. They are a band of degenerate thieves and keeping them independent leaves a constant dagger poised to stab us in the back. To solve this we have only one real option."
DKB_Liberate_Kalmykia: "Liberate the Kalmyks"
DKB_Liberate_Kalmykia_desc: "The Kalmyks are a strange bunch. As the only native Buddhists in Europe we once ruled them. However, in the chaos after Black Monday they broke free and continue to flaunt their freedom. They are vulnerable to intervention. We must strike first before the Petrograd Regime and secure our flanks!"
DKB_Liberate_the_Mountains: "Liberate the Mountains"
DKB_Liberate_the_Mountains_desc: "The Mountain Republic’s continued existence is a threat. While not particularly favoring the Germans or Petrograd, their fragile economy could give any one side an way in. If they gain enough influence they could use them as a proxy to strike us first! To prevent this inevitable result of their weakness we must strike first and save them from themselves!"
DKB_The_South_Liberated: "Solidify Our Hold Over South Russia"
DKB_The_South_Liberated_desc: "We have taken the Caucasian Region and already our administration is rapidly expanding to accommodate these new lands. With our position solidified we have only one way to go, and thats towards our ultimate destiny."
DKB_Kolchakite_Question: "Kolchakite Question"
DKB_Kolchakite_Question_desc: "As we move ever closer to our greatest challenge yet we have received an interesting proposal. Apparently Boris Shteifon, a general in our armies, has been in contact with the Transamurian leadership. He has suggested we offer them a deal in support of our war. Vlasov see’s the undeniable pragmatic wisdom in such a proposal, a two front war would take pressure off our front. However he was also rather hesitant to deal with Transamur. Not only are they a Japanese puppet and a pretender to the mantle of the True Russia. Dealing with them could give legitimacy and help a potential enemy down the line. However, Vlasov must still decide what to do."
DKB_Slay_the_Dragon: "Slay the Dragon!"
DKB_Slay_the_Dragon_desc: "We are now standing on the precipice of greatness. Our lands are as ready as they will ever be and the Russian Bear will only grow stronger the longer we wait. Vlasov has given a heroic and inspiring speech to the soldiers as they prepare for their greatest task. He had named them Heirs of St George, slaying the terrible dragon in Petrograd who pretends at power.

DKB_Russia_Liberated_desc: "Oh how the Vlasovtsy celebrate their hard won victory.

###German Events###
germans.1.t: "The Death of Andrey Vlasov"
germans.1.a: "All According to Plan..."
germans.1.d: "Andrey Vlasov has been murdered by socialsits, His car was found in a ditch riddled with bullet holes and the inside was covered with blood though the body was nowhere to be found. Some of his soldiers are already calling foul play but we are assuring them that this is truth. Though this infomation did come from von Leeb so even von Pannwitz has some doubts..."

germans.5.t: "Rise of the Sicherheitsbrigaden"
germans.5.d: "Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb is one of the Generals Germany has sent to help bring our army up to par, however von Leeb seems more focused on achieving political stability in the Don by any means necessary. To do this he has formed the so-called Sicherheitsbrigaden (Security Brigades), made of completly German soilders who all happen to be ideologically aligned with von Leeb. Their supposed purpose is to ensure the Security of the German Administration but many believe they are just von Leeb's personal military force for terrorizing the Native population and gaining influence over the Government."
germans.5.a: "Perhaps we should keep an eye on them."

germans.6.t: "An Unfortunate Event"
germans.6.d: "Horrible News! A small village outside of Tsimlyansk has been burned and looted by unknown forces. Many are claiming Kaminski's Brigade is reasonable for this while Kaminski and the SB are claiming it was Socialist Bandits. Whatever the case really is von Leeb has used this event to bolster the size of the SB on the pretense of 'preventing another attack'."
germans.6.a: "I want the head of the one responsibe on my desk!"

germans.4.t: "Ataman von Pannwitz"
germans.4.d: "The Krug has accepted the proposal to make von Pannwitz Ataman of the Don Cossacks! In a traditional ceremony this morning Pannwitz was proclaimed Ataman of the Don Cossack to mostly applause, though some Cossacks were not quite happy with it. This effectively means we have ended all Cossack opposition to our rule which is obviously a good thing. Von Pannwitz himself couldn't be happier with being Ataman as he has always dreamed of leading a Cossack force."
germans.4.a: "Long live the Ataman!"

germans.7.t: "Formation of the Ostlegionen"
germans.7.d: "The Caucasus are a region home to many ethnic minorities many of whom would be willing to server in our army but are pushed away due to it's cossackization, we have found a solution to this probelm, the Ostlegionen. The Ostlegionen will be a part of our army made up of only ethnic minorities who will fight for us, along with this the SB has created it's first foreign brigade. These will soon be forces to be reckoned with!"
germans.7.a: "Give a promotion to whoever thought of this."

germans.3.t: "The Generalgouvernement Plan"
germans.3.d: "History time and time again has proven the Russians to be our irreconcilable enemy if left to their own devices. However a solution has been proposed by SB leader, Wilhelm von Leeb, The Generalgouvernement Plan.\n\nThis plan would entail an effective extended large scale military occupation of the Russian Territories, collaboration with local officials, and supporting German migration east under a 'Generalgouverneur' of 'Russland'. Opponents to this plan claim it would only enrage the Russian populace, eventually ending in an inevitable revolt against our government. These points however, have been ignored by Von Pannwitz who has chosen to go foward with this plan taking up the new title of Generalgouverneur-Feldataman.\n\nBesides, this is only going to be temporary, right?"
germans.3.a: "You're fired if this goes wrong, von Leeb!"

germans.2.t: "Crowning of a New Dynasty"
germans.2.d: "With the defeat of the Russian hordes it had come time, Wilhelm had come to add another title to his long list of titles. The ceremony itself was the most opulent with many from the Lutheran Church, Orthodox Church, German Nobles and even Russian Nobles. There to crown Wilhelm with a Russian Crown was a Lutheran Priest. As he arrived at where he was to be made Tsar of Russia and the beginning of the Hohenzollern lines of Tsars for the Russian Empire. Before the Priest could crown Wilhelm he took the crown and anointed himself leaving no contestment for who’s authority made him the Tsar of Russia. His beloved cousin Nicky had failed, now he shall succeed where he failed through superior Prussian Might and Steel as well as finish what Peter ‘the Great’ had started."
germans.2.a: "Long live Vilgelm the First! Zar of All Russia!"

germans.19.t: "RkP in the State Diet"
germans.19.d: "Despite our best efforts to prevent the Russians from basically locking us out from the State Diet. All the various parties still left from before the invasion united under the ‘RkP’ acquiring more than enough seats to be the majority. With their majority they are hoping to pass laws to keep us out from their government and rule themselves. If they begin to rule themselves, who could say if they won’t try to invade us like in the last war? The Military in the Tsardom will be duly informed on this development. Hopefully the military can solve this without bloodshed. If not we’ll repeat what we did last time and see to it they’ll know their place"
germans.19.a: "Well... this isn’t good."

germans.20.t: "German Dominance in the State Diet"
germans.20.d: "As expected we the mighty Germans have secured the iron grip around the Diet’s throat. We can legislate and change the laws as much as we may desire. The will of Russia is now our will, without a doubt. All this because the Russians were too busy fighting amongst themselves to stand up to us. Hopefully it’ll stay that way and we’ll be able to safely turn this land into a place more loyal than our African holdings. Russia, not Africa, will be the Crown Jewel in the Empire of the Germans!"
germans.20.a: "Hail to the Kaiser!"

germans.18.t: "The Kaiser Question"
germans.18.d: "Russia has been unified under the sheer might and awe-inspiring power of the Kaiserreich’s military. With the largest nation on the planet subjugated by the greatest military power on Earth, we could have easily bent the nation to our own desires and oppressed the local Russian people without obstruction or reproach, but instead we graciously decided to bring civilization to this savage, frozen wasteland. As our war machine tore through the nation, in its wake we planted the seeds of Prussian Constitutionalism - the noblest form of government in existence as exemplified by the glorious Kaiserreich. We have brought federal parliamentarianism and measured enlightened monarchism to this wild expanse, laying the foundations of true and modern civilization, and at the top of it all is Tsar Vilgelm, the greatest monarch in Russia’s history! \n\nHowever, with the Russian people now truly in charge of this nation, of course mediated by the Crown, perhaps it is finally time for a change, for Tsar Vilgelm certainly has more pressing matters in Berlin to deal with than to continuously need to travel or check-in to Moskau for appearances and ceremony. To abate these issues and to reward our new loyal subjects, we could attempt to persuade the notoriously difficult Kaiser of Germany to leave the throne, preparing it for Prince Roman Petrovich - a native Russian and Romanov distant enough from the main line to be easily controlled. However, this move could anger the military, mostly filled with loyalists and fanatics, to the point we could see the military overthrowing the newly established Reichstag to keep Vilgelm on the throne, bringing Russia back to square one since the invasion. Regardless of this possibility, we cannot in good faith say that our populace laments the idea of being free from a foreign German nobility. \n\nTo combat these rivaling camps in an attempt at compromise, there is the option of keeping a Hohenzollern on the Russian throne. The first candidate is the Kaiser's second son, Prince Eitel Friedrich of Prussia, a renowned Nobleman who unlike many of the Kaiser's other sons, does not yet possess the crown of one of Germany's many allies and conquered territories. A more neutral choice would be Prince Louis Ferdinand von Preussen, both a Hohenzollern and Romanov through marriage. Louis Ferdinand could provide a middleground candidate that can appease all and keep the peace. However, if we were to choose this young Prussian Prince, then an agreement would have to be made as to which name he would be crowned under - either as Louis I appeasing Berlin more, or as Ivan VII, appeasing the Russian majority. These things must be considered carefully and be totally calculated, for the consequences of such a decision going awry could easily leave us in a tight spot, causing irrevocable damages or worse. "
germans.18.a: "No, we shall keep Vilgelm as Tsar of All Russias."
germans.18.b: "The Kaiser will ‘graciously’ abdicate, and in his place Roman Petrovich will reign!"
germans.18.e: "The Kaiser will ‘graciously’ abdicate, and in allow Prince Eitel Friedrich to take the throne!"
germans.18.c: "For the sake of compromise, crown Prince Louis Ferdinand as Tsar Ivan VII!"
germans.18.f: "We must compromise and crown Prince Louis Ferdinand as Tsar Louis I!"


germans.23.t: "The Death of the Tsar"
germans.23.d: "With the death of Tsar Vilgelm I, Tsar Vilgelm II has taken the throne. The coronation has taken place, and the new Tsar of all Russia is now the son of the late Vilgelm. Cheers from the coronation members erupted, and the Kaiser of Germany has only tightened the bond with the Russian people."
germans.23.a: "Hail to thee in the victor's wreath!"



germans.8.t: "The KONR Returns"
germans.8.d: "The Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia has existed in a state of leaderless limbo ever since it's leader, Andrey Vlasov was brutally murdered by Socialist partisans a few years ago. This presents an interesting opportunity for us as we are in desperate need of collaborationist organisations supporting our Government, so we will help the KONR reorganize as our main Russian collaboration organisation. \n\nThe committee has already accepted the proposal to aid us in Governing Russia, and have even finally elected a new Chairman, Boris Sheyfton, who was once a General in the now defuct Russian Liberation Army. Even though some question if Sheyfton or the Committee as a whole are truly loyal to us, they will be vital propaganda tool in making the Russian populace believe we are not conquerors, but liberators."
germans.8.a: "A toast to our new Friends in the Committee!"

germans.10.t: "The Sicherheitsbrigaden Issue"
germans.10.d: "It is no surprise that the Sicherheitsbrigaden underneath Willhelm Von Leeb has been operating autonomously, after all they were dispatched here to deal with the vast amounts of partisans, however recently it seems they have completely disregarded Pannwitz’s overall authority over these lands. This is an increasingly worrying prospect as their ‘suppression tactics’ have been growing more bloody and in size, as it seems entire villages are deemed to be suspect and put to the bullet and torch. Any attempts to order them to cease and desist is simply shrugged off as now it seems they only answer Leeb, with Pannwitz’s rank being simply disregarded, all the while cossack runners keep reporting the devastation in villages that the SB passed through. \n\nNow it seems Von Pannwitz will have to make a decision regarding these prodigal children, with Leeb no longer following his orders as designated ruler of these lands, Pannwitz could punish him, especially with the sheer inhumanity of the killings he is committing, or allow him to continue keeping the Russian’s rebellious nature down."
germans.10.a: "Punishment is in order, Mount up the Cossacks!"
germans.10.b: "Do nothing, what's the worst that could happen?"

germans.14.t: "The Fate of the Unions"
germans.14.d: "Despite all efforts, it seems the words of syndicalism will always find a way to spread themselves to all corners of the world. And now it is our time to deal with this problem, as the calls for the legalisation of Trade Unions have been growing louder and louder. This has caused quite the stir within our government as several factions have formed regarding the issue.  \n\nOn one side, many believe that all trade unions should remain outlawed and that no concessions should be given to the red menace. On the other side, the so called "Unionists" have finally decided to make their intentions clear, as they openly support many syndicalist ideas. It seems letting them go unchecked was a bad idea. Nevertheless, their leader Robert he has proposed that trade unions be allowed only for german workers and under government regulation. This idea is also greatly popular amongst other members of our government who support the unions.\n\nIt is time to choose whose idea we will follow. And considering the position of our Economic Minister Andrei Shkuro as anti-union, we may have to make some drastic changes..."
germans.14.a: "Trade Unions? What is this syndicalist nonsense?"
germans.14.b: "We will go with Unionists’ approach of german-only unions."

germans.15.t: "Fate of Russian Industries"
germans.15.d: "With our conquest of the vast land of the Rus finally coming to a close, the time has come to rebuild from the chaos that engulfed the nation. The people, while now firmly under our rule, still lack any kind of loyalty or trust to our government, save the Volga Germans. \n\nWith this being the case, and with our economy currently in ruins to put in mildly, something must be done to fix this pressing situation. One such solution to this issue has reached the desk of [DKB.GetLeader], proposed by the more radical officers from among our little company. In short, the plan calls for the complete nationalization of all Russian owned business and industries into a single state-owned corporation, both to further along our reconstruction but also to speed along the process of germanization. While obviously a radical solution, it may just be enough to get our economy back on track. Along with this radical solution came a less radical one, from the same clique of officers. Still wishing to push germanization, this second plan calls for the complete nationalization of all Russian owned industries like it's sister plan, with one exception. This exception would be those corporations who pledge totally and undying loyalty to the Kaiser and the Reich, or in other words, collaborators. Finally, we could simply refuse either of these plans, and allow German companies to compete with the locals. After all, the freer the market, the freer the people, right?"
germans.15.a: "Only German companies shall exist in the new Russia!"
germans.15.b: "German and Russian industries would be better off peaceably coexisting."
germans.15.c: "Allow those who are willing to cooperate with us stay in business."

germans.16.t: "The Case of Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb and the Sicherheitsbrigaden"
germans.16.d: "As the Moscow Trials near closer to completion, the moment we've been putting off since the beginning of the trials began is here, much to our chagrin. Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, leader of the SB and close confident of the German administeration, has been charged and found guilty of Crimes Against Peace, War Crimes, Crimes Against Humanity, and Conspiracy to commit said crimes. Along with Von Leeb, his co-conspirator, Bronislav Kaminski has also been found guilty of many similar crimes, although perhaps less so due to his status as a non-German. With both of these men found guilty, all that remains is to decide what to do with them. While obviously Von Leeb shall swing for his actions, many are calling for Kaminski to join him on the gallows, instead of wasting resources on him in prison. Others still, are pushing for us to use this as leverage against the SB, to finally crack down on that group which has caused us so much pain. How shall we proceed?"
germans.16.a: "Von Leeb shall swing, and that will be enough."
germans.16.b: "Von Leeb and Kaminski shall swing, as well as the SB's senior leadership!"
germans.16.c: "Von Leeb shall swing and Kaminski will join him, a fitting end."


germans.13.t: "Pannwitz’s Control Restored"
germans.13.d: "The early morning was beginning at the camp, many of the Sicherheitsbrigaden just waking up and beginning breakfast calls, all the while Kommadant Leeb was in the command tent, reviewing his grand plans once more. However the morning crickets and activities were interrupted by the sound of massed horses hooves stomping on the steppe as Pannwitz’s collaborator cossacks rushed at the SB’s encampment. Panic spread throughout the SB as many Cossack riders already entered the base and were running throughout, demanding the SB units that had managed to reach their rifles disarm. The occasional rifle crack broke out, but the shooters were quickly dispatched, and any further resistance on the SB’s part was discouraged as proper German Grenadier squads moved in the encampment. A Cossack and a German Lieutenant entered Leeb’s tent, noticing a burning pile of plans, their contents forever unknown. Informing Leeb that under the order of Von Pannwitz, the entirety of the Sicherheitsbrigaden and it’s commander were to be put under arrest. Astonished at the sheer audacity of this move, Leeb was tempted to offer resistance to the Cossacks, however the fact that an entire company was already within the camp disarming his men while an even larger force was on the overlooking hill prepared for a fight, Leeb was in no position to resist, and so gave himself over. \n\nBeing sent off to the Fatherland proper to be put in a prison on Kaiser’s personal order, Leeb’s career was now at an end, his own life barely avoiding the same fate due to friends that at least managed to prevent him being put on trial and firing line. The rest of the Brigade would be put into prisons under watch of the German Grenadiers throughout Russia, with the worst criminals in the brigade being identified by village survivors and put to the bullet."
germans.13.a: "A Victory for Sensibility."

germans.12.t: "The Land of Brimstone"
germans.12.d: "Today all across our major cities and power centers violence has erupted as it appears Leeb has launched a putsch, with the Sicherheitsbrigaden storming government buildings, killing collaborator assemblies and garrisons. Unexpectedly storming into the cities and seizing key government buildings, the SB dispatched or forced resignations of governors and overseer’s who didn’t align to their goals. The streets had many chaotic skirmishes between the Native collaborators or Pannwitz aligned grenadier squads, who attempted to initially oppose the SB’s coup, however after a few hours and with the brigade having caught Pannwitz’s loyalists off guard, many units lost the will to fight and surrendered, however in a what could only be described as an atrocity, many SB units kept firing upon and slaughtering the surrendered cossack and collaborator units. \n\nPannwitz himself was intercepted in an attempt to escape Moskau and was captured. Beginning a radio broadcast, Leeb announced that the Sicherheitsbrigaden had engaged in a grand operation against a conspiracy by the collaborating native Russians which reached into the highest echelons of the government. Having assigned himself as the new Generalgouverneur while filling out other key positions throughout the land with ministers loyal to him, Leeb sent Pannwitz away to the lowly position of mayor of Wolgaburg in order to isolate him from power. Portraying these events as simply a change in the colonial leadership, they have managed to secure this seizure of power even with the Fatherland looking on with immense distaste. Now with all power centered around Leeb and the Sicherheitsbrigaden, it appears that the eastern land is his and his entirely to govern, and all his possible plans able to be enacted."
germans.12.a: "An abomination before me."

germans.17.t: "An Audience with the Kaiser"
germans.17.d: "The day of the long awaited meeting had finally arrived. Dressed in his best garments and proudly confident, von Leeb was ready to give his (slightly embellished) report. The Meeting started well, although with visible disinterest from the Kaiser regarding mundane numbers and statistics. However, as the exposition continued towards its main goal his expression quickly shifted from curiosity to worry to absolute shock. When von Leeb finally began talking about his plans to resettle tens of millions of Russians to beyond the Urals and replace them with German settlers, he finally burst out in anger. \n\nWhat followed were fifteen minutes of utter rage. Von Leeb could only stay silent as his plans and ideas were deemed as utterly deranged and absolutely horrific, and his own person as a complete imbecile and lunatic. By the time he had calmed down, von Leeb’s face was pale as snow. Before he could even react, the Kaiser ordered him to speak in his own defence and then leave to await further instructions. If he wanted to keep his career the shocked and visibly shaken von Leeb would have to choose his next words carefully."
germans.17.a: "Duly noted."
germans.17.b: "I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."

germans.22.t: "In Furious Anger"
germans.22.d: "As Von Leeb uttered what were to be his final words, he swiftly put his hand inside his jacket. Before anyone could react, a secret hidden pistol would fire two bullets directed at the Kaiser's chest. The following firefight was brief, with only one member of the Royal Guard ending up dead due to a lucky shot to the head and another slightly injured in the leg. The Kaiser thankfully managed to avoid the bullets, but was nonetheless transported to the nearest hospital in order to check his vitals. As for Von Leeb, he would not survive the encounter. As he bled out on the floor, succumbing to his many wounds, no one dared help the old, miserable man."
germans.22.a: "So he fell with shame to his own damnation."

germans.24.t: "In Great Wrath"
germans.24.d: "As the news arrived in Moskau, everyone knew what was about to happen. As no clear leader had been set by Berlin, Von Pannwitz was the first to take action and declare himself the legitimate government in Saratov. With the Ostheer divided and soon enough fighting each other, other powers decided to take action. From an organised syndicalist resistance to traitors within the Committee itself, many different factions have sprung up vying for power. As Russia burns and devolves into anarchy, one can only wonder what the future of this dammed state will be."
germans.24.a: "What have we done unto this land?"

germans.240.t: "A New Leader for the Generalgouvernement"
germans.240.d: "With the collapse of the Generalgouvernement seeming immanent, leadership is direly needed. Rising to the task, Cossack factions under Atman von Pannwitz has made a strong case for becoming the new Generalgouverneur. At the same time, army cliques led by general Keitel have appealed to the Colonial Office in Berlin to take charge over whats left of our territories. Who will come to lead Moskowien?"
germans.240.a: "We have to regroup at our birthplace. To Don and Saratov with Pannwitz!"
germans.240.b: "The army can be the only salvation of our state. Hail Ostheer and Keitel!"
germans.240.c: "The Position of Generalgouverneur remains empty."

germans.25.t: "The Red Barons Wings"
germans.25.d: "Having migrated East as part of the many germans left unemployed by Black Monday, a young german engineer would start a relatively small motors company, wanting to focus on building tractors for the growing german farmer population in the region. However, his luck would change as he participated in an aircraft competition hosted by none other than the Red Baron himself as part of the government funded program of supporting new entrepreneurs. Having won with flying colours, this would be a new beginning for the young engineer. \n\nNow the “Roter Baron” Eastern Aircraft Company is one of the rising stars in the market, having gained much popularity thanks to personal endorsement by the National War Hero and great quality of their aircraft, already having signed contracts with many of Mitteleuropa’s eastern members, mostly focusing on personnel carriers and private transports. Their next goal is armaments, particularly long-range bombers, for which they have already signed contracts with the Generalgouvernement. One of those is the jokingly called “Uralbomber”, named after it’s first experimental test flight almost crashed into said mountain range. \n\nWhatever the future of the company may be, they have already left a notable mark on history and the aviation market."
germans.25.a: "The East is really a land of opportunity."

dkbfor.62.t: "The Night After"
dkbfor.62.d: "Against all odds, they had done it. The German delegation to the Smolensk Conference had agreed to most major demands, and Russia had peaceably regained many of her former lands. This, if anything is, was an accomplishment to be celebrated, and celebrated it was. Starting simply as a trip to a local bar in Smolensk by the Russian delegation of the Conference, things quickly got out of hand. Be it the fact that every single bottle of Vodka in the bar was emptied, the 'disappearance' of many of the delegation with local women, or the sheer amount of damage caused by the delegates, the Russian embassy was not the happiest to learn of the events of the night. Most of the delegates have been harshly rebuked, with a few getting off only with a slap on the wrist. Regardless, the people of Smolensk shall long speak of the conference held there, telling their children how Russia was able to get Germany's aid for almost nothing, and then the damaged caused the night following."
dkbfor.62.a: "What a night..."

vlasov.1.t: "The Rostov Manifesto"
vlasov.1.d: "’Friends, Countrymen, Soldiers’ these three words began the so-called Rostov Manifesto. Issued by Chairman Vlasov and the Central Committee the Manifesto seeks to lay out the goals and aims of KONR. While the first few paragraphs seemingly relish in lambasting Germany and Japan for splitting off their own puppets and Petrograd for doing little if anything to take them back along with swearing to unite “all Russians from Poland to the Pacific”, the next four pages are more policy oriented. In them Vlasov sets out his goals for Russia. He announces his support for the rights of free speech, assembly, press and religion while also promising self determination for all the minorities of Russia. The ambitious document was eagerly distributed across the world where it was met with at best mild bemusement and at worst open laughter. It seems that few men in the halls of power really believe Vlasov can make his ideal Russia a reality."
vlasov.1.a: "We will show them just how wrong they are"

vlasov.2.t: "Cossacks Sidelined"
vlasov.2.d: "It happened slowly at first. So slowly in fact that few Cossacks even realized something was happening at all. One by one their loyal friends and allies in the administration were given new, important jobs like Minister of Agriculture or Vice Cultural Advisor to Monaco. In their place new men took their place, men who didn't know the Cossacks and cared little for them, instead pledging total loyalty to Vlasov and KONR. Then, finally the Cossacks looked around and realized they had no more friends. It appears that they have decided they will not take this obvious power grab by the state lying down. The Cossacks, led by Pokrovsky. have begun raiding outposts and isolated homesteads. This has been an annoyance but all together a minor one. These men are the holdovers of an ancient, bygone era where horse and lance were the pinnacle of military technology. Already they have lost many men they cannot afford to lose as they foolishly charge down tanks and machine guns."
vlasov.2.a: "The bug stomps itself"

vlasov.3.t: "Cossack Autonomy"
vlasov.3.d: "Today in a grand ceremony in Rostov the Cossacks and KONR have signed the finishing touches to the new compromise between the state and the freedom loving Cossacks. In return for giving the state nigh unprecedented powers over their traditional strongholds the Cossacks have been promised to get free reign over much of the endless steppe of Russia. As the two sides shake hands and smile for the camera there are many who wonder if the agreement can really hold and if it can, for how long."
vlasov.3.a: "A Deal with the Devil"

vlasov.4.t: "ROA Ramps Up Propaganda Efforts"
vlasov.4.d: "While the KONR has been in control of the Don for quite some time its propaganda arm was content with keeping itself in the political sphere. That is why a vast majority of the propaganda posters on every corner were drawing people into KONR and demonizing the Petrograd Regime. However recently new posters have gone up over the old. These new posters lionize the Russian Liberation Army as supermen on a mission from destiny to liberate all of Russia from the grip of Teuton oppression. These posters have been particularly effective with not only ethnic Russians, but exiled Ukranians as well who see the ROA as a sort of ‘trial by fire’ they can use to gain valuable experience they could later use to liberate their own homeland. While the ROA and KONR certainly have their own designs for ‘liberating’ Ukraine they need all the men they can get."
vlasov.4.a: "More Fuel for the Fire"

vlasov.5.t: "Taking Notes from Solidarism"
vlasov.5.d: "To rebuild The Don’s shattered economy Vlasov has cast a wide net for ideas. One of these ideas he has taken a particular liking to is Solidarism, a rather new ideology that has gained traction in Russia as well as the Don. In the Solidarist world view the class war of the Left and class oppression of the right are both wrong answers. Instead, Solidarists seek to reconcile the upper and lower classes to create a more harmonious nation. Vlasov, in an ever ravenous quest of unity of all Russians, has taken quite a liking to this and has begun to institute Solidaritat economic policies in the Don. While it is too early to definitively say that these policies have ended the Collapse, the numbers tell an encouraging story. All we can hope is that the line will continue to go up."
vlasov.5.a: "We Solved the Economy!"

vlasov.6.t: "The Kolchakite Question"
vlasov.6.d: "As we prepare for our Great Crusade we have been approached by a long lingering faction within the KONR led by Sheyfton. They have asked that we reach out to Admiral Kolchak, the Japanese puppet in the East, and seek an alliance. While Vlasov initially wanted to dismiss this suggestion out of hand, further thought has given him pause. The ancient adage ‘the enemy of my enemy is a friend’ remains true even today. If Vlasov and Kolchak were to ally a non-insignificant portion of the Russian Army, an army that has a near overwhelming numerical and industrial advantage over him, would have to split off many forces to send East, far across Siberia to fight in the Trans-Amur. However at the same time Kolchak is more of a puppet than any of the Petrograd stooges. His power is explicitly based on the grace of the Japanese Army. To ally with him could compromise his image as the last true champion of an independent Russia."
vlasov.6.a: "If we squint enough, we can ignore his strings"
vlasov.6.b: "No Compromise, No Mercy"

vlasov.7.t: "The KONR Wants an Alliance!"
vlasov.7.d: "We have received a most peculiar message from an equally peculiar source. The Nationalists who have seized control of the Don have sent us a proposal for an anti-Petrograd alliance. They claim their preparations for a war against the False Regime are almost finished and seek to use our combined forces to split the mighty Russian Army in twain. It's certainly an audacious plan and one with merit, but also one that a trained military officer like Kolchak has already found faults in. If they were to ally there would be no support between the two. This means that the Transamur Army and the Don Army will be fighting alone regardless of how Kolchak responds. Kolchak also suspects that Vlasov simply seeks to use him as a punching bag to draw Russian troops East and away from his border. Again, at the same time, with two enemies so far apart, a breakthrough on one front could not be so easily contained. As Kolchak debates within his mind what to do, the hour to respond arrives, and Kolchak makes his choice."
vlasov.7.a: "Together We are Strong!"
vlasov.7.b: "I will not send my men to die for a fool's errand"

vlasov.8.t: "Kolchak Has Refused!"
vlasov.8.d: "We have received a response from Kolchak and it is...less than expected. He has not only declined our offer but he has offered some ‘respectful suggestions’ on how to better go about fighting Russia. These suggestions, in so many words, tell us to wait for a better time and only fight when he wants us to, not when we want to. This response has enraged Vlasov and he has made several very loud and very colorful condemnations of Kolchak."
vlasov.8.a: "We don't need them anyway."

vlasov.9.t: "Tambov Trials"
vlasov.9.d: "In our final destruction of the German puppets in Petrograd we have rounded up quite a few political bigwigs. These men either chose to stay out of some foolish sense of duty, patriotism or were more simply trapped by circumstance. Now they languish in jails, resigned to whatever fate may befall them. Some have asked us to lean on the judges to be fair, despite their righteous hatred. They feel like unduly punishing the men who have led the people, despite their true leanings, earned them a great deal of respect from many common people. They point out that people who see their heroes be hanged after a kangaroo court are less likely to accept the new status quo and more likely to cause trouble. Others however urge that we punish all those traitors as harshly as the law allows. They point out their blatant treason and sycophancy towards the Kaiser doomed Russia to decades of exploitation by foreign powers and then plunged the nation into chaos. They encourage us by saying that the people will rejoice seeing their tyrant's corpses burn. Ultimately however it's up to Vlasov. Should he intervene and reign in the inevitable victor's justice, or let vengeance take its course?"
vlasov.9.a: "We Must Respect The Law"
vlasov.9.b: "We Must Punish Those Who Wronged the Rodina"


vlasov.10.t: "Birth of the Union for the Struggle for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia"
vlasov.10.d: "With Russia having been liberated from the German puppets the KONR has become redundant. Russia is liberated after all. Instead Vlasov has taken most of the KONR into the new Union for the Struggle for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. The Party is little different from KONR and many see it as more of a name change however to Vlasov it is the culmination of decades of struggle. After countless sleepless weeks and oceans of blood and sweat shed in the pursuit of a Russia free from all who seek to shackle her, the vehicle for that goal, KONR, is now no longer necessary. Of course he is still needed. Russia is as vulnerable as a newborn babe, weak and scared as the wolves prowl just over the border. To leave it now would doom it to decades more of exploitation. To secure it the SBONR will maintain its hold over the nation...for now at least."
vlasov.10.a: "For Fatherland and Unity!"

vlasov.14.t: "A Third Russian Revolution?"
vlasov.14.d: "Recent Russian history has been defined by Revolution. The February Revolution toppled the despised Tsar and shuffled in the do-nothings of the Kerensky Government. Then the October Revolution ushered in the tyrannical bloodshed of the Bolshevik dictatorship and the Civil War. Now the newest Revolution, the March Revolution, has finally ended the cycle of decay and rebirth that has defined it for so long. Some argue that such a momentous occasion deserves to be celebrated and petitioned for the March Revolution to be celebrated every year, just as the February and October ones were. Vlasov is however hesitant. He maintains that Russia has too much to do before it can placate itself with “useless frivolities” like yet another holiday. However, the morale boost of the celebration could help us in the long run."
vlasov.14.a: "The March Revolution begins!"
vlasov.14.b: "We don't need such antics"

vlasov.15.t: "Foundation of the Federation"
vlasov.15.d: "Through much trial and tribulation, dictatorship and autocracy, the Russian people finally have their due. The Russian Federation that has been the dream of so many patriots has finally come true. Now all Russians will have a true voice in their government and Russia will finally be free. No more will a Tsar lord over them and act against their interests! No more will Kerensky play pretend democracy while running yet another dictatorship! No more will the specter of Bolshevik anarchy hang over the Russian people like a knife over their throats!"
vlasov.15.a: "By the People, For the People!"
vlasov.15.b: "What about the Economy?"
vlasov.15.c: "With our Guidance, nothing can stop us!"

vlasov.16.t: "A Flagging Issue"
vlasov.16.d: "As the new Russian Federation has begun to be established a new question has come up, what flag will we use? Vlasov and KONR never really had a flag, they had to rapidly adopt one after seizing control of the Don. That flag has been argued by some as a relic of an era that Russia has passed. If Russia was to move on, they claim, it must leave the flag behind. They however have come up with a new flag which is just the old flag but lacking the eagle. Party loyalists also have drawn up their own proposal and its rather...ambitious. They propose the SBONR Flag be adopted as the national flag. They say it's a symbol of the new unity of Russia as the UR Party is Russia and Russia is the Party. Vlasov has doubts over all these proposals yet has to choose one. After thinking way too hard about it, he finally makes his choice."
vlasov.16.a: "If it works, dont fix it"
vlasov.16.b: "Change the Flag"
vlasov.16.c: "Change the Flag, but make the colors vibrant"
vlasov.16.e: "Russia is the Party, the Party is Russia!"

vlasov.17.t: "Rise of the Blue Vozhd"
vlasov.17.d: "Working closely with the Solidarists has paid dividends beyond our wildest dreams. As Vlasov promoted Solidarist ideals the Solidarists gained in power who in turn and in thanks, gave him even more power. Now Vlasov stands as the undisputed ruler of a truly reborn Russia. The old class conflict that had threatened to tear the nation apart these past decades has been healed and both the rich and poor work together for the first time in a generation. Atop this new order Vlasov stands, more powerful than ever and ready for whatever the world may throw at him next."
vlasov.17.a: "God is not in power, but in Truth!"
vlasov.17.b: "God, Nation, Labor!"

vlasov.18.t: "King of the Castle"
vlasov.18.d: "When Vlasov took over Russia few expected him to last long. Many observers both foreign and domestic dismissed him as another petty despot in a long line of petty despots. This was only reinforced by the fact that Vlasov seemingly had no real support from the two biggest forces in his new Russia. When the Liberals approached him and offered their support in return for democratizing reforms, Vlasov blew them off. He denounced their degenerate liberal ideas as the very thing he fought against in his war against Kerensky and the Republic at large. When the Solidarists approached him next, promising industrial harmony in return for giving up some of his power, he blew them off too. He declared their idealism as a poison which will doom Russia to even more internal strife than the Democrats. Yet despite knocking down two institutional pillars, the house still stands. His only real base coming from the minorities he has begun to give significant autonomy. The head of that house, Andrei Vlasov, stands as well; he stands truly free of all strings and shackles. He brought himself this far and now there is no telling just how much farther he will go."
vlasov.18.a: "One Ruler, One Russia!"
vlasov.18.b: "The People and the State, United!"

vlasov.19.t: "Veterans Affairs"
vlasov.19.d: "In order to further secure his power Vlasov has turned to the veterans of KONR and the ROA for support. Making up a non-insignificant power base, many of these veterans have already found success in business and politics in the new Russia. Having them on side Vlasov not only secures a solid pillar to build his platform off of, but he also secures true independence. Selling out to one side or the other would inevitably lead to reform and a deviation from the Russia Vlasov dreamed during his days in the Don. All of that felt like a lifetime ago now. And now that life of dreams will be made a reality and nobody will be able to stop him."
vlasov.19.a: "We March into the Future"

vlasov.20.t: "A Handshake with the People"
vlasov.20.d: "Who better to know what the people want than the people themselves? To better make his Russia one where all can succeed Vlasov has decided to go around the obstructionist and vain politicians and deal directly with the masses. Through a series of large public gatherings Vlasov has gathered the people's most pressing concerns and agreed to address them and in return, they will assuredly support him. One of the most biting concerns is the need for democratization. While Vlasov is no democrat he knows when to give and when to take. If the people demand elections in return for their support then Vlasov will give them elections."
vlasov.20.a: "A Truly National form of Populism"

vlasov.21.t: "In Solidarity with the Solidarists"
vlasov.21.d: "To further shore up his power Vlasov has approached the most unlikely of power bases. He has approached the Solidarists, a relatively new movement which has grown by leaps and bounds as of late. The Solidarists have come forward and offered to bind the lower and upper classes together in a new social contract. One where everybody will know their place and accept it. In return all Vlasov has to do is simply allow the Solidarists to work their magic. Vlasov himself maintains some doubts about their promises and dislikes being in anybody’s debt, much less a newcomer like the Solidaritists yet there is little choice to be had. He must find some way to secure his rule and the Solidarists seem all too eager to give it to him."
vlasov.21.a: "For Unity and Progress!"

vlasov.22.t: "Birth of the RPNS"
vlasov.22.d: "As Russia undergoes the tectonic shifts of reorganization under Vlasov, one of his most recent moves seems to have had an unexpected result. A few days ago Vlasov finally got around to banning the RNNS, a minor opposition party. Vlasov himself seemed to not think much of it. Yet today he was stunned when Bronislav Kaminski, a staunch ally of his since the days before he took over the Don, announced publicly he was leaving the Party and forming his own, the Russian National Freedom Party. This group has many things in common with the SBONR and in some aspects seems to be forming on an even further right wing platform. However its voter base, after some investigation, seems to be small. Despite this, some in Vlasov’s inner circle urge him to ban the RPNS too. They say any opposition, no matter how small, cannot be tolerated. Give an inch and they take a mile. Meanwhile others point out that the RPNS is again, rather small in comparison to the Party and poses little if any threat in the near future. Instead they ask Vlasov to let it run or even, as some charge, try and wield it as a controlled opposition. A release valve of sorts to keep the people's anger in check."
vlasov.22.a: "Let Kaminsky die in the wilderness"
vlasov.22.b: "Crush them!"

dkb.1.t: "The Almighty Don Host"
dkb.1.d: "The Don Republic or the Almighty Don Host was originally proclaimed on May 18, 1918, by Ataman Pyetr Krasnov. During the Russian Civil War, he assisted the White Army fighting the Bolsheviks and strengthened his position in southern Russia by allying with the Kuban People's Republic until, as the end of the war approached, the central White government of Russia ordered the suppression of the Kuban Republic, which, although cooperating with the White movement, wanted to maintain its independence and even unite with Ukraine. The Don, however, was able to retain a small amount of autonomy as a result of Krasnov's compromise with Kolchak and President Sazonov.\n\nThis all changed after the defeat of Kolchak's putsch. Krasnov, who, as a monarchist, opposed the republic, took the opportunity to proclaim a new government and tried to march on Volgograd, but failed and was forced to retreat, uniting with the remnants of Kolchak's forces in southern Russia. However, thanks to German intervention, they achieved full independence and became a buffer state in the Caucasus.\n\nSince then, the Don Republic has not fared any better. The lack of modern industry has weakened the army, the Russophile faction led by Afrikan Bogaevsky has become increasingly defiant, and the question of the German delegation present since the German border arbitration, which determined the borders between the Don, Kuban, and Mountain Republics, has proved alarming. If Pyetr Krasnov wants to remain ataman of the Don Army, he will have to deal with these and many other problems."
dkb.1.a: "Krasnov will bring back our lost glory."

dkb.2.t: "Cossack Circle"
dkb.2.d: "'Kazachiy Krug' ('Cossack Circle') is the main legislative and executive state authority in the Don Host. The members of this 'Krug' represents the Russians, Don Cossacks, the Kalmyks, and other minorities in our country. This authority has a right to discuss almost every significant question related to life in the country. Though Krasnov can promulgate his orders even without the approval of the 'Krug', but he has to consider its opinion in every case, if he wants to remain in control over the Don."
dkb.2.a: "Ancient traditions still living on to this day."

dkb.213.t: "The Liberation Army Grows"
dkb.213.d: "The Russian Liberation Army, commonly known as ROA, is the paramilitary wing of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia (KONR). Despite their miniscule role in the Don-Kuban's political landscape, in recent years their forces have grown substantially. The ROA has been able to recruit among those those who are tired of Kerensky’s ineffectual rule, as well as disillusioned radicals and vengeful veterans. While it is unknown how the Committee managed to accomplish their recent success, thankfully they have remained cooperative with our Cossack Host. However, this has not stopped some within our state from worrying if Vlasov's band may be planning something grander, suggesting that we should spend some resources on investigating this matter further." 
dkb.213.a: "Keep a close eye on them."
dkb.213.b: "Who is Andrey Vlasov?"

dkb.214.t: "Andrey Vlasov and the Committee"
dkb.214.d: "Born in Lomakino in 1901, Andrey Vlasov was originally a student at a Russian Orthodox seminary, but abandoned theology after the February Revolution to pursue agricultural sciences instead. However, in 1920, he was drafted into the failing Red Army during the waning days of the Civil War, fighting on the Southern fronts in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and Crimea. As the Red Army collapsed, the young Vlasov defected to the advancing White Army and the Russian Republic to survive, later on rising rapidly through the ranks due to his competency. 1924 almost marked the young officer becoming promoted to the rank of general-mayor, yet fate had other plans just a year later. During the ill-fated Kolchak Putsch, Vlasov's unit was stationed in Petrograd as the Coup began. Originally loyal to Kerensky, his forces were quickly surrounded by Kolchakites and captured. Andrey was offered a choice to either rot in prison or join the efforts of the Admiral, which he ultimately accepted. As the Putsch was suppressed and Kolchak fled to the Far East, the disgraced young commander was forced to escape South to Don-Kuban. During his time in the Cossack Host, Vlasov began to gather disillusioned exiles, and in 1929 formed the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia. Believing that Russia must be 'liberated' from corrupt politicians and traitorous military officers like Kolchak and Kerensky, the KONR authorized the creation of the Russian Liberation Army. Over time the small paramilitary grew in strength and would continuously seek recognition from the Union's government, but would always be ignored or refused. Now, with the clouds forming over the Host, Vlasov may finally get the opportunity to implement his plans for Russia and beyond." 
dkb.214.a: "Interesting."

dkb.3.t: "Berlin Stock Crisis Comes to the Don Republic"
dkb.3.d: "As predicted, the Don's finances and economy are in deep crisis. The average Cossack faces problems selling his products, and a number of factories are closing. This means that various dangerous elements will have a greater impact upon the political landscape of the Cossack country."
dkb.3.a: "God save us from the worst!"

dkb.4.t: "The Germans Withdraw Capital"
dkb.4.d: "Various German businessmen and investors are withdrawing money from the Caucasus. Krasnov is loosing his political power as more and more Cossack are looking towards a union with Russia."
dkb.4.a: "Damn."

dkb.5.t: "Kalmykia Secedes"
dkb.5.d: "Today, the Kalmyk Host has announced its will to declare independence. Even worse, nearly all of our Kalmyk forces have also left for the newly established country..."

dkb.5.b: "Traitors, they shall feel our wrath! (War with Kalmykia)"
dkb.5.c: "Kalmykia Rises! (Play as Kalmykia)"

dkb.204.t: "Our Failure"

dkb.204.a: "Damnit."

dkb.206.t: "Russian White Exiles Arrive!"

dkb.206.a: "We will not disappoint them."

dkb.207.t: "March North?"
dkb.207.d: "Russia has been in a State of chaos since the Revolution ended the Republic, it would be rather easy with the help of the White exiles to seize part of Russia for ourselves though we may not want to risk poking what remains of the Bear."
dkb.207.a: "Better safe than being in a firing line."
dkb.207.b: "Take everything up to Tsaritsyn!"
dkb.207.c: "We shall march on Saratov!"

dkb.208.t: "The Don Cossacks Seize Tsaritsyn!"
dkb.208.d: "The Don Cossacks have taken Tsaritsyn and the surrounding areas. While this is clearly an act of war, there is really not much we can do with our broken Army."
dkb.208.a: "Damnit!"
dkb.209.t: "The Don Cossacks seize Saratov!"
dkb.209.d: "The damned Cossacks have taken everything up to Saratov! This is clearly an act of war, and we could justfiy a war with them though it would be costly."
dkb.209.a: "There is nothing we can do."
dkb.209.b: "They will pay! (War with the Don Cossacks)"




dkb.6.t: "Bogaevsky Criticize Krasnov"
dkb.6.d: "Bogaevsky, the leader of the pro-Russian faction in the Cossack Circle has criticized Krasnov and denounced his policy of appeasing the Germans. With the Berlin Stock Crisis and Germany slowly loosing its supreme role in world politics, cooperation with them won't bring stability to the country like it may have a few years ago."
dkb.6.a: "He's only talking."

dkb.7.t: "Anti-Krasnov Coup!"
dkb.7.d: "After Bogaevsky's speech, the Country has quickly became a rhetorical battlefield between pro-German and pro-Russian factions. This only escalated with more fighting in the Cossack Circle ending with a brief shootout at the capital building. It would now appear that Bogaevsky is attempting a total coup d'etat against our Government! It also appears that other Factions, such as the Socialists, Vlasov's Militias and the German Garrison are preparing to seize power for themselves if the situation were to devolve enough."
dkb.7.a: "Krasnov's Guards defeat Bogaevsky's rebels."
dkb.7.b: "Krasnov is killed in the Chaos!"
dkb.7.c: "The German Garrison intervenes and saves Krasnov."

dkb.210.t: "The Death of Krasnov"
dkb.210.f: "In the Chaos of the coup, Ataman Krasnov has been killed as Bogaevsky stormed the capital, however Bogaevsky's poltision is far from stable. The Socialists are already taking to the streets, the Vlasovites are marching from Rostov and the German Garrison is preparing to restore their influence at any cost. Novocherkassk is soon to fall into total chaos."
dkb.210.a: "Bogaevsky defeats the rebels."
dkb.210.b: "The Socialists take up arms and storm the capital."
dkb.210.c: "Vlasov manages to overpower the Socialists and Russophiles."
dkb.210.d: "The German Garrison intervenes and takes power for themselves."


dkb.8.t: "Clashes in Rostov"
dkb.8.d: "Since the Circle decided to support Krasnov, Bogaevsky has been vigorously opposing the organization. To this end, almost all the pro-independence cossacks have left the Circle. Even worse, yesterday saw violence on the streets of Rostov between Bogaevsky's and Krasnov's cossacks; we must immediately stop the civil unrest."
dkb.8.a: "Crush Bogaevsky's Militia."
dkb.8.b: "Try to negotiate with Bogaevsky."

dkb.9.t: "Krasnov's Opposition"
dkb.9.d: "Since the Circle decided to support Bogaevsky, the current Ataman of the Don Host, Pyetr Krasnov, has openly denounced the Circle, and declared the Official Opposition. He is more than willing to save his position, whatever it takes."
dkb.9.a: "Crush Krasnov's Opposition."
dkb.9.b: "Try to negotiate with Krasnov."

dkb.10.t: "Bogaevsky's Coup"
dkb.10.d: "It was impossible to negotiate with already radicalized Cossacks. In order to prevent further bloodshed, Afrikan Bogaevsky, with the help of loyal cossacks, has seized the administrative buildings in Rostov. Krasnov has been arrested and Bogaevsky was proclaimed the new ataman by the loyal Cossack Circle. It is over!"
dkb.10.a: "Glory to Bogaevsky!"

dkb.11.t: "Krasnov Secures His Power"
dkb.11.d: "The militia of Bogaevsky has finally been crushed with their leader arrested. Krasnov consolidated his grip over the Don Republic and stayed as the ataman. Now, the Republic will face further cooperation with Germany."
dkb.11.a: "Glory to Krasnov!"

dkb.12.t: "'And Quiet Flows the Don'"
dkb.12.d: "A prominent young author, Mikhail Sholokhov, has published his monumental novel: 'And Quiet Flows the Don'. It tells a story about the Don Cossacks in the First World War and the Civil War, which combines several storylines. A conservative writer who was on the side of the Whites during the Civil War, Sholokhov devotes a significant place in the novel to the Red Cossacks, and his main character, Grigory Melekhov, at the end of the story never 'comes to the Whites'. While the novel received a lot of criticism for its pro-socialist ideology, many consider it to be a reaction towards Russian post-war policy. The novel is going to be translated into German, French, and English and is predicted to become a bestseller among leftist and rightist readers alike."
dkb.12.a: "A great book!"

dkb.13.t: "Dawn of the Red Don"
dkb.13.d: "The Don Republic has been finally liberated from the yokes of the capitalism. The Don People's Socialist Party, led by Chairman Syrtsov, with the help of Budyonny's Red Cossacks has finally achieved the victory in the long class war against rich Cossacks, who were too busy serving German capital to stop us. Many things should be done before we are strong enough to defend our borders from an invasion, but the groundwork is now laid for such an effort. The dawn of a new socialist republic has begun - and it will end only with the river Don painted dark red with our workers' blood. Regardless, we will fight and endure the rigours of this violent capitalist world."
dkb.13.a: "A good start."

dkb.14.t: "Syrtsov Delivers Speech"
dkb.14.d: "Prime-Minister of our republic, Sergey Syrtsov, has delivered a speech in the centre of Rostov, in front of a square, crowded with workers and peasants. As Syrtsov observed the crowd, he noted that 'hard times are coming, comrades. We should be more consolidated nowadays. We are surrounded by enemies, but a bright future for our nation is near. We will never surrender, and through our effort, we will prevail!"
dkb.14.a: "What next?"

The legacy of Lenin lives on, and his last hopes are concentrated in the hearts of fellow comrades, who live on the banks of the river Don."
dkb.16.a: "Let the world hear."

dkb.17.t: "Red Cossacks"
dkb.17.d: "During the Russian Civil War, the south of Russia was a great battlefield for all the sides. Here General Kornilov led the Volunteer Army, Denikin and Wrangel competed for the control of the South Russian Front, and, finally, our comrades established various Soviet republics. Premier Syrtsov still remembers these times when he served as a Commissioner for National Economy and vice-chairman of the Don Soviet Republic. A lot of time has passed since those days, and now the Red Cossacks of Semyon Budyonny lead the second Socialist Republic in Don. He will never forget the help of the cossacks that supported the Soviet power in this region. The so-called 'Red Cossacks' will help us this time as well - the cossacks are still respected in our population - and they will be eager to listen to the cossacks who are serving the proletariat."
dkb.17.a: "Cooperation instead of enmity."

dkb.18.t: "Gosplan"
dkb.18.d: "The new economy of the Don Republic should be planned. To this end, we will pursue the 'Gosplan', established by chairman Syrtsov as an efficient state body that will carry out national planning for the development of the national economy and control over the implementation of national economic plans."
dkb.18.a: "Much better than the market."

dkb.19.t: "Private Property?"
dkb.19.d: "While the ownership of private property is generally banned in our republic, some officials believe that we should allow cooperatives to exist. Not only will they ensure better cooperation between proletariat and peasantry and give them a reason to work; they will also allow the state to implement a special tax for profit."
dkb.19.a: "Ban any private ownership."
dkb.19.b: "Allow cooperation."

dkb.20.t: "Council of People's Deputies"
dkb.20.d: "With our republic stabilizing more and more, it is time to end the transitional period of the supreme power of the party's head. The legislation initiative shall now belong to the Council of People's Deputies - an elected parliament of our socialist republic."
dkb.20.a: "A true workers' democracy!"

dkb.21.t: "Council of People's Cossacks"
dkb.21.d: "With our republic stabilizing more and more, it is time to end the transitional period of the supreme power of the party's head. The legislation initiative shall now belong to the Council of People's Cossacks - and elected parliament of our socialist republic, consisting of 'People's Cossacks' - the most prominent party members."
dkb.21.a: "Socialism with Cossack characteristics."

dkb.22.t: "The Role of the Chairman"
dkb.22.d: "At this moment Semyon Budyonny has almost unlimited power, being a kind of a dictator in the country. From this perspective, he's no better than good old Ataman Krasnov, who ruled our country for 15 years, being a German puppet and a kleptocrat. Some people in the party believe that his role should be limited and he must step down - not only by the parliamentary Council, but also by the party and the government. Budyonny is a good man and a good leader - he won't confront the party in this question, but his authority is high enough to stifle initiative and consolidate power in his hands. What will happen?"
dkb.22.a: "Budyonny increases his role."
dkb.22.b: "Budyonny steps down and let Syrstov become a new Chairman."

dkb.23.t: "Remnants of Russian Socialists"
dkb.23.d: "After the Civil War, the majority of the Bolsheviks left for the French Commune. Those who stayed were either repressed or murdered. However, there are still fellow comrades in Russia who struggle to restore Soviet power. We should invite them into our country to join our fight against the Whites."
dkb.23.a: "Together we are stronger."

dkb.24.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Join Internationale"
dkb.24.d: "We have received an offer from [FROM.GetName] to allow them to become a part of our alliance."
dkb.24.a: "We cannot risk a war with Russia."
dkb.24.b: "Sure, comrades!"

dkb.25.t: "The 'NÈVE' Nationalization"
dkb.25.d: "The Taganrog iron and steel plant was originally founded by a Belgian industrialist named Albert Nève. During the Civil War, we nationalized the factory, but Nève managed to privatize it again three years later. It is now time to restore the Taganrog plant to the hands of the proletariat- all steel belongs to the workers and our republic!"
dkb.25.a: "Get rid of this pathetic excuse of a Belgian entrepreneur."

dkb.26.t: "French Commune Refused!"
dkb.26.d: "The French Commune has just proven that it is nothing more than a capitalist nation that hides under syndicalist banners! This is outrageous!"
dkb.26.a: "Disgrace!"


dkb.40.t: "Initial Stabilisation"
dkb.40.d: "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less-affected branches of the economy have bounced off the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."
dkb.40.a: "Let's hope stabilisation will come soon."

dkb.50.t: "Further Stabilisation"
dkb.50.d: "The economy continues to regain pre-crisis efficiency."
dkb.50.a: "Keep it up!"

dkb.60.t: "An Illegal Trade Union Was Found"
dkb.60.d: "We have found another secret trade union in one of our factories. Workers have united to demand higher wages and better workplaces in this factory, and we now know the cause of this activity! We must blame the spread of syndicalist propaganda for this!"
dkb.60.a: "Allow it to operate but watch them closely."
dkb.60.b: "Disband the union and arrest the workers!"

dkb.61.t: "Unrest in Rostov"
dkb.61.d: "While the Cossack Circle was busy in their feud, the workers organized a large strike in Rostov and Taganrog. In the times of the already destabilizing Berlin Stock Crisis, this is a disaster. If we give up and accept their demands though, it is likely we won't risk revolution."
dkb.61.a: "Give in their demands"
dkb.61.b: "Never believe a syndicalist."

dkb.62.t: "Clashes in Rostov"
dkb.62.d: "There are reports of armed clashes in Rostov, with socialist protesters demanding the resignation of the Ataman and an immediate transition to a socialist republic. We can try to stifle the revolution, but our success is not guaranteed."
dkb.62.a: "Do something!"

dkb.63.t: "The Unrest Crushed!"
dkb.63.d: "The socialist protesters were crushed and their leader, Syrtsov, was arrested. Nothing will stop us now from improving the economy and politics."
dkb.63.a: "Great!"

dkb.64.t: "Revolution!"
dkb.64.d: "The rebellion has quickly spread, with Rostov lost to the socialists first, and then Taganrog and Nakhichevan. The Cossacks have refused to shoot these workers, and some of the Cossacks have even joined the rebels! The Cossack Cirle was disbanded, with Krasnov fleeing to Germany and Bogaevsky fleeing to Kuban. Now all the power is in the hands of Budyonny, who triumphantly united the Red Cossacks and Workers under the Banner of Socialism."
dkb.64.a: "Long live the socialist republic!"

dkb.65.t: "Red Cossacks Take the Mantle"
dkb.65.d: "Today, the new socialist government in the Don Republic, south of Russia, has proclaimed itself the successor of the nearly forgotten Soviet Russia, a nation destroyed in the chaos of the Russian Civil War.\n\nThe Chairman of the Don Socialist Republic, Semyon Budyonny, has stated that the revolutionary struggle of the Russian proletariat has not ended, but if we don't let up, the power of the Soviets will be eventually restored in Russia.\n\nIt is still a hot topic for discussion: how will the Russian government react to such statements, and will it tolerate the aggressive neighbour in its southern frontier?"
dkb.65.a: "The Russian Eagle will be destroyed by the Hammer and Sickle!"
dkb.65.b: "Will Russia ever rest?"

dkb.66.t: "Revolution in the Don Republic!"
dkb.66.d: "The socialists came to power in the Don Republic in the aftermath of the Black Monday catastrophe. While this is bad enough, the new leader of the nation has gone so far as to openly criticize our government, and has proclaimed himself the successor of Lenin. How shall we react?"
dkb.66.a: "Remind him how Lenin finished."
dkb.66.b: "Destroy them later."
dkb.66.c: "Seize Tahanrih!"

dkb.67.t: "Opposition to the Regime"
dkb.67.d: "Before the fall of the old regime, the Russian state was a battlefield for many political factions, from the far-left to the far-right. Russian society was very polarized, and it is even more polarized now that our government rules all of Russia. Though we are Russians ourselves, from the people's view, we are invaders. We should begin stabilizing our regime with dealing with the most fierce opposition - especially amongst the conservative and rightist parties and organisations."
dkb.67.a: "Cleanse the opposition."

dkb.68.t: "Fate of Socialist Parties"
dkb.68.d: "The second part of our regime stabilization is to solve the question of what to do with socialists. While our ideas are almost the same, some of the socialist parties, like the social democratic Mensheviks and even the liberal Socialists-Revolutionaries are spreading their anti-government propaganda. We should deal with them now, or face the consequences of neglecting this threat later..."
dkb.68.a: "Arrest their leaders and ban their party."
dkb.68.b: "Allow them to exist... for now."

dkb.69.t: "Trade Unions Issue"
dkb.69.d: "The Trade Unions are strong in Russia, and so, we should decide what to do with them. While some believe that trade unions are a truly socialist democratic phenomenon that we should use for our own interests, others believe that trade union policy should be dependent on the party politics."
dkb.69.a: "Independent Trade Unions"
dkb.69.b: "State controlled Trade Unions."

dkb.70.t: "Fate of the Russian Army"
dkb.70.d: "The Russian Army was much more organized and, frankly, massive than ours, and it is time for us to catch up. While many of the officers and soldiers have joined our side in this liberation war, some of them cannot be trusted. Some high military leaders have left the country, but the ones who stayed could be dangerous for the regime."
dkb.70.a: "Purge the army..."
dkb.70.b: "...and recruit new soldiers"

dkb.71.t: "The GlavVoyenSovet"
dkb.71.d: "The [ROOT.GetLeader] along with the supreme military stuff has proposed the establishement of the GlavVoyenSovet or the Main Military Council, that will be the head office of our new armed forces. The Council will be headed by the Chairman of Military and Navy Affairs, and will maintain and manage the Army."
dkb.71.a: "New to some, old to others..."


dkb.80.t: "Land Redistribution in Stavropol"
dkb.80.d: "The Stavropol region has a Russian majority, but the Kalmyks, who live in the Steppes near the Caspian Sea, claim that some of these lands in Stavropol should become a part of the Kalmykia. On the other hand, the Russians point out that the Kalmyks took lots of the peasant's lands in Stavropol during the civil war, and that the government must launch a land redistribution in the northern part of Stavropol region. What should we do?"
dkb.80.a: "The Russians are right - give these lands back to them."
dkb.80.b: "We won't start any land redistribution."
dkb.80.c: "The Kalmyks will get new lands!"

dkb.90.t: "Sharia Courts in Chechnya"
dkb.90.d: "The Terek river divides the lands of the Terek Cossacks in the North and the Chechen lands in the South. The Chechens have asked us to allow them to use Sharia law and have Sharia courts. The Terek Cossacks think that this decision will lead to the radicalisation in this region, as well as new clashes between the local Cossacks and the Chechens. That's why the Cossacks suppose that they should have a right to arrest the radical Muslim priests who use the rules of Islam to solve different cases in the Chechen region. We have to give them our answer."
dkb.90.a: "The Cossacks will bring order to Chechnya!"
dkb.90.b: "We are a secular state, but only state authorities will arrest lawbreakers."
dkb.90.c: "The Chechens can use the Sharia law; it is a Muslim tradition..."

dkb.100.t: "Assassination Attempt!"
dkb.100.d: "Today the Ataman's residence was attacked by a group of unknown terrorists who intended to kill our leader Pyots Krasnov! It seems that the main reason was the unpopular reforms he has implemented, which provoked significant instability in the Don-Kuban Union. From now on, the Ataman and his supporters have to pursue much more elaborate -and careful- policy efforts to restore order in the country and reduce the dissent of the nation."
dkb.100.a: "Keep calm and carry on!"

dkb.101.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Invites Us In Their Alliance"
dkb.101.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] decided to form an anti-Russian political and economic alliance. Their final goal is to unite all cossack hosts in the territories of former Russian Empire and proclaim a new Russian Government. How will we react to this?"
dkb.101.a: "What a stupid idea!"
dkb.101.b: "We shall try!"

dkb.102.t: "Restoration of the Don-Kuban Union"
dkb.102.d: "We have finally undone the damage done by the collapse of the First Don-Kuban Union in the 1920s, we shall be united and strong, and proclaim a new Cossack century!"

dkb.103.d: "The Ataman of All-Russian Cossack Host, [ROOT.GetLeader] has announced that the Russian Cossack State will transform to democracy. The Transitional regime should be established soon."
dkb.103.a: "Let's see how it goes."

dkb.104.t: "Fate of PSR and RSDRP"
dkb.104.d: "The left-wing democratic parties of PSR and RSDRP are a threat to the new Russian republic we are building. These socialists, hiding behind democracy, can undermine the foundations of our new state. We should decide what to do with them."
dkb.104.a: "Ban them."
dkb.104.b: "Ban them and arrest their leaders."

dkb.105.t: "Fate of Eurasianists and NRPR"
dkb.105.d: "The right-wing parties of Eurasianists (EP) and Savinkov's NRPR are a threat to our state. While Eurasianists want to get rid of our traditional Russian Culture, the methods of the NRPR are too radical for some. Moreover, the NRPR are criticizing our government, and see us as traitors. We should decide what to do with them."
dkb.105.a: "Ban the NRPR and the EP."
dkb.105.b: "Ban only the NRPR."
dkb.105.e: "Allow the EP to exist, but ban from elections."

dkb.106.t: "Reform the Senate"
dkb.106.d: "The reforms to the Senate, suggested by [ROOT.GetLeader], consist of creating a new proportion of representators in the body. Half of the senators should be cossacks, and the other half should be nobles, aristocrats, professors and industrialists."
dkb.106.a: "Approved."
dkb.106.b: "Let the other half be elected directly by the people!"

dkb.107.t: "The Role of President"
dkb.107.d: "In the old Russian Republic, the president was just a nominal figure, appointed by the Senate, who could do something only if the Duma and the Prime-Minister were on his side. This greatly destabilized the system, and many argue that it led to the assassination of Kerensky. In the new republic, as proposed by the Transitional Government, the president should have full authority over the parliament and the executive branch."
dkb.107.a: "A great idea for such a large country!"

dkb.108.t: "National Elections"

dkb.109.t: "Fate of Trade Unions"
dkb.109.d: "The previous Russian Government has not fully dealt with the Trade Union issue. We should once and for all decide the fate of these organisations..."
dkb.109.a: "Trade Unions are a threat to a new Russia."
dkb.109.b: "Allow only state-controlled unions."
dkb.109.c: "Let them operate, they are useless."

dkb.110.t: "The Russian Monarchy"
dkb.110.d: "The Tsar is our true leader, the Father of the Nation. Since ancient times, the Cossacks have sworn fealty to the Tsar of All Russias. With Russia finally in the hands of cossacks, it's time to restore the Russian monarch on his legal place."
dkb.110.a: "Long Live the Tsar!"


dkb.205.t: "They Have Refused!"
dkb.205.d: "The Government of the Country we offered to to join our faction has refused. Now this must be answered with War!"
dkb.205.a: "To Arms!"

dkb.211.t: "Moving to Moscow"
dkb.211.d: "Moscow hasn't been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great made what is now Petrograd the capital. Since the illegitimate Petrograd Regime used the city we should perhaps consider using Moscow as our new capital, not only to distance ourselves from the Petrograd regime but as a callback to the foundation of Russia."
dkb.211.a: "Long Live Russia, One and Indivisible!"

dkb.212.t: "Moving to Saint Petersburg"
dkb.212.d: "Petrograd has been the capital of a united Russian State since 1712 when Peter The Great created it from the ground up. Our government using the city as our capital is a sign of legitimacy and will allow the public see us a the legitimate Russian State. We shall also rename it to it's old name, Saint Petersburg."
dkb.212.a: "Long Live Russia, One and Indivisible!"

dkb.111.t: "Who Shall Wear the Crown?"
dkb.111.d: "Upon our government taking up the mantle of the tsardom following our victory, we must now decide on who to crown as Tsar. We have created a list of different noble candidates whose family ties have supported us in the past before, and thus we can ensure these youthful choices we are selecting from will treat the Cossacks with the dignity they deserve in the motherland. We can choose some of the much younger options of princes Vsevolod, Mikhail II or  Roman, who if we are to select, ensures their loyalty to our cossack regime with their crowning. We can select a much more safe and orthodox choice in Vladimir III, whose lineage is the closest to our passed former benefactor of Nicholas the II. But there is another alternate choice that has slyly spread into our circles of debate. That of Felix  Yusupov, who we could crown to start a new line that is dedicated to our cossack order’s continued dominance of the wider Motherland."
dkb.111.a: "Mikhail II"
dkb.111.b: "Vsevolod I"
dkb.111.c: "Roman I"
dkb.111.e: "Vlad III"
dkb.111.f: "The wildcard Yusupov is crowned as Felix I"

dongerman.1.t: "Cooperation With Germany"
dongerman.1.d: "Pyetr Krasnov, Ataman of the Don Host, has presented a bill, entitled the "Law on Cooperation with the German Empire to the Cossack Circle". The Bill mentions military cooperation and economic integration into the German sphere of influence, among other things. As was said by Krasnov, only Germany can protect our free Cossack state from Russian expansionism and aggression."
dongerman.1.a: "Send the proposition to the Kasierreich."

dongerman.2.t: "An Offer From the Don Republic"
dongerman.2.d: "The Don Republic has announced it's desire for cooperation with the Kasierreich. We definitely have an interest in the Caucasus, most notably being the oil fields. Our presence in the Caucasus could also possibly prevent Russia from intervening in Eastern Europe."
dongerman.2.a: "Sign the treaty!"

dongerman.3.t: "Don-German Treaty of Friendship"
dongerman.3.d: "The Germans have eagerly accepted our offer to cooperate and have signed the Treaty of Friendship with our government."
dongerman.3.a: "A toast to our new German friends!"

dongerman.4.t: "The Don-Kaukasien Deutsche Verwaltung"
dongerman.4.d: "With our clear direction and desire to further integrate with Germany, the German Administration, sent as part of the Treaty of Friendship with Germany, can now affect our economy. Depending on the influence of the German Administration, our economy will get buffs. But should the influence of the German Administration become too high, it will become harder and harder to keep our sovereignty."
dongerman.4.a: "We should watch them closely..."

dongerman.5.t: "The Fall of Vlasov"
dongerman.5.d: "Andrey Vlasov has offically been removed as the leader of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia after pressure from the Krug and German Administration. Vlasov himself has already been arrested and is awaiting his trial. The Committee have already elected a new Leader, Ataman Krasnov effectively turning them into our puppet. The fantasy of us conquering Russia alone dies here."
dongerman.5.a: "A Traitor's due."

dongerman.6.t: "Integration of the ROA"
dongerman.6.d: "The so called 'Russian Liberation Army' was little more than the paramilitary wing of the KONR, however with us now controlling the Committee we may now integrate the ROA into our main armed forces."
dongerman.6.a: "An army to protect us."

dongerman.8.t: "Ostlegionen"
dongerman.8.d: "The German Administration has presented us with an initiative calling for a so-called "Ostlegionen" or Eastern Legion, consisting of ethnic minorities that live in the Don region. The Ostlegionen would be directly integrated into the ROA, and it will no doubt be a mighty force that will put the fear of God into our enemies."
dongerman.8.a: "An excellent idea! Conscript the minorities!"

dongerman.9.t: "Distancing ourselves from Germany"
dongerman.9.d: "The German Garrison has worried us with their actions during the coup (or more inaction during the coup). The Ataman has decided that we must begin distancing ourselves from Germany at once, for the Good of the Don."
dongerman.9.a: "This is for the best."

dongerman.10.t: "The Garrison Must Go!"
dongerman.10.d: "The German Garrison has overstayed it's welcome in the Don Host! In a unanimous decision the Krug has decided that the German Garrison must be expelled from the Don Host immediately. The Germans have not responded yet however it is not a stretch to think that they won't be happy."
dongerman.10.a: "It had to be done."

novoros.1.t: "Bogaevsky's Republic"
novoros.1.d: "With Afrikan Bogaevsky quickly rising to become the Ataman of the Don Host, it is time to decide what to do next. While Afrikan himself is looking forward to cooperating with Russia, he has ambitions of his own. If the government of the Russian Republic won't recognize Bogaevsky as an ally, he will be forced to turn against them."
novoros.1.a: "Bogaevsky will be the savior of the Don!"

novoros.2.t: "Project: Free Republic"
novoros.2.d: "Ataman Bogaevsky has presented his 'Project Don Republic' legislation to the Cossack Circle. If passed, the Almight Don Host as it is known will be renamed to the Don Repyblic and will draw ever the closer to the  Russian Government. A new democratic government will be formed with a new constitution adopted as we begin this process."
novoros.2.a: "Passed! Begin the project!"

novoros.3.t: "Arrest Krasnov"
novoros.3.d: "It seems that with Bogaevsky consolidating his grip over the Republic, the supporters of Krasnov have no choice but to join him. Their leader, the former Ataman of the Don, Pyetr Krasnov, has been arrested for treason. While many claim that Bogaevsky is only angering the former Ataman's loyalists, no real opposition to his rule exists."
novoros.3.a: "Krasnov got what he deserved."

novoros.4.t: "Army of Don Republic"
novoros.4.d: "As we build our new nation, the need for a more professional army is becoming ever the more obvious. In this new army, we shall rely no longer relay on Cossacks alone, but shall also recruit from the peasantry, regardless of background."
novoros.4.a: "A modern army for a modern state."

novoros.5.t: "Customs Union With Ukraine"
novoros.5.d: "The region of Don is heavily populated by Ukrainians, consisting of about 30% of our population. During the rule of the previous government, despite its connections with Germany, the Ukrainians were oppressed, their language was prohibited, and they had no official residence permits. By granting these privileges to the Ukrainians, we can hopefully gain more sympathy from the Ukrainian minority."
novoros.5.a: "Let's see how they answer."

novoros.6.t: "[FROM.GetName] Offers a Customs Union"
novoros.6.d: "The government of the recently established [FROM.GetNameDef] has offered us a customs union. Moreover, they are willing to give residence permits for all Ukrainians, who now live illegally in their territory. They are also willing to allow the Ukrainian language to be used in official settings. While the offer is good, we know that the [FROM.GetAdjective] government is pro-Russian and could be considered hostile."
novoros.6.a: "This will help make life better for our countrymen! Approved!"
novoros.6.b: "They are a hostile government! Rejected!"

novoros.7.t: "Ukraine Refuses"
novoros.7.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] govement has refused to establish a Customs Union. In retaliation, we shall not grant residence permits for Ukrainians. This will escalate the relations between our two nations, but they have made their choice."
novoros.7.a: "Odd, they don't seem too worried about their own citizens."

novoros.8.t: "Ukraine Accepts!"
novoros.8.d: "Ukraine has agreed to establish a Customs Union with us! We shall grant residence permits for all Ukrainians, as per our arrangement. Hopefully, this will help to establish good relations between our two nations."
novoros.8.a: "Here's to our new Ukrainian friends!"

novoros.9.t: "The Constitution of Don Republic"
novoros.9.d: "Today, at long last, marks the completion of the Don Constitution. Based heavily off of the Russian constitution of 1920, with influences from both the Kaiserreich and the United States's own constitutions. In effect, Don Republic is to be a free, bicameral representative republic, with the head of state still maintaining enough power to effectively overrule the Duma and Council of the Republic respectively. The document also guarantees the right of assembly and free speech, as well as enshrining the Russian language as the official state language of Don Republic. Overall, the document is a great increase for freedom and civil rights within Don Republic."
novoros.9.a: "Glory to Bogaevsky!"

novoros.10.t: "Don Republic Demands Formal Recognition!"
novoros.10.d: "The recently established state of Don Republic has demanded our recognition and guarantees. We can support their independence or make sure they don't hope for any freedom."
novoros.10.a: "It is an artificial state."
novoros.10.b: "Recognize their government as legitimate, perhaps this could help us in the future."

novoros.11.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Recognized Our Government!"
novoros.11.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has recognized our state and our independence."
novoros.11.a: "This is wonderful news!"

novoros.12.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Did Not Recognized Our Government!"
novoros.12.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to recognize our state, and has decried us as an illegitimate government."
novoros.12.a: "We can count on no one but ourselves..."

novoros.13.t: "Expel German Delegations"
novoros.13.d: "The German presence in Don Republic is, to put it mildly, against us due to us persuing closer ties with Russia. We simply must expel the German delegation as soon as possible. Their attempts to intervene in our internal affairs are reason enough to justifiably remove them from our glorious nation."
novoros.13.a: "Back to Germany you go, you rotten snakes."

novoros.14.t: "Council of the Republic"
novoros.14.d: "Bogaevsky has ordered the creation of the Council of the Republic as part of his political reforms for the new Don Republic. The Council shall act as the upper house of the new Parliament. Modeled after the Russian Senate, the Council shall represent the upper class of the Don population. The members of the Council are to be directly appointed by the Ataman of the Republic, and in turn, the Council shall elect the Ataman for life, as well as review any and all bills passed by the future Duma before their implementation into law." 
novoros.14.a: "The first step towards becoming a true republic."

novoros.15.t: "The State Duma of Don Republic"
novoros.15.d: "The lower chamber of the parliament - the State Duma - has been established as a result of Bogaevsky's reforms. Consisting of representatives elected by any man over the age of 18, the new Duma shall form the basis of our new Republic. Following it's creation, a snap election was called and already the NSPN has achieved an absolute majority. However, the Kadets and Mensheviks have also gained a sizable mandate in recent elections."
novoros.15.a: "The foundation stone of the Republic has at last been laid."

dkbfor.1.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Incorporation!"
dkbfor.1.d: "The hostile government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has demanded our immediate incorporation into their state. While their army is large, we may still be able to defend ourselves."
dkbfor.1.a: "They are too strong."
dkbfor.1.b: "Never!"

dkbfor.2.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Agreed!"
dkbfor.2.d: "The cowardly government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to join our country without bloodshed."
dkbfor.2.a: "A wise choice."

dkbfor.3.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Rejected the Ultimatum!"
dkbfor.3.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] believes it is strong enough to defend themselves, and so has rejected our righteous demands. How shall we proceed?"
dkbfor.3.a: "Leave them alone, we have bigger fish to fry..."
dkbfor.3.b: "To arms!"

dkbfor.4.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Land"
dkbfor.4.d: "Claiming that the majority of these territories are populated by the Russian, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has demanded we cede this territory to them. While transferring land in the East would only make us more vulnerable to Russia, many advisors urge us to avoid risking a war."
dkbfor.4.a: "These lands our rightful ours! We will stand our ground!"
dkbfor.4.b: "Peace is always preferable to war."

dkbfor.5.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Returns Donbass And Crimea"
dkbfor.5.d: "Following our demands, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to cede Donbass And Crimea to their rightful owners.."
dkbfor.5.a: "The pen is mightier then the sword."

dkbfor.6.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refuses to Cede Land!"
dkbfor.6.d: "Unfortunately, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused to cede us our rightful territory! How shall we deal with this going forward?"
dkbfor.6.a: "They called our bluff; we are not ready for war."
dkbfor.6.b: "They want to do this the hard war way? So be it." 

dkbfor.7.t: "Peace With [DKB.GetNameDef]?"
dkbfor.7.d: "The government of [DKB.GetNameDef] has occupied our eastern provinces. This war is beginning to threaten the existence of our very nation. Perhaps we should sue for peace?"
dkbfor.7.a: "Let's start peace talks."
dkbfor.7.b: "We shall crush this artificial Cossack state!"

dkbfor.8.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Sues for Peace!"
dkbfor.8.d: "The [FROM.GetNameDefCap] government, following our recent glorious victories, is ready to throw in the towel. They have agreed to cede the contested lands so peace can return between us. Of course, we don't have to agree. After all, the breadbasket of Europe in it's entirety is a very nice prize... "
dkbfor.8.a: "Deal, peace shall once more reign between us."
dkbfor.8.b: "No, all of Ukraine shall be ours!"

dkbfor.9.t: "Socialist Insurgency in Yekaterinodar"
dkbfor.9.d: "With the establishment of a socialist republic in Don, the powerful cooperative movement in our country has begun to radicalize. Unless we deal with it soon, our rule may not survive."
dkbfor.9.a: "Try to suppress the movement."
dkbfor.9.b: "Deal with the leadership!"

dkbfor.10.t: "Violent Protests in Yekaterinodar"
dkbfor.10.d: "Our attempts to deal with the socialists have been in vain. The protesters have somehow become armed and are demanding more freedom for trade unions. If we won't give up, they are likely to overthrow our government."
dkbfor.10.a: "Give them what they want"
dkbfor.10.b: "Do anything to suppress these rebels!"

dkbfor.11.t: "The Insurgency Suppressed!"
dkbfor.11.d: "The socialists have given up, and our country appears to be stabilizing from the shock of the near overthrow of our government. We need to be prepared for anything else the vile Socialists in the Don have planned..."
dkbfor.11.a: "The Red Menace is once more defeated!"

dkbfor.12.t: "The Socialists Overthrow the Government"
dkbfor.12.d: "The protesters have managed to overthrow our government. The vile Cossacks have been over thrown, and our county is under the Red banenr of freedom atlast!. As a first offical act, the new Worker's government has requested annexation into the last bastion of Socialism in Russia, the Don."
dkbfor.12.a: "Only together with the Don can we avenge Lenin!"

dkbfor.13.t: "Kuban Falls to Socialism"
dkbfor.13.d: "The protesters and workers have managed to overthrow the corrupt Kuban government, and are willing to unite with us into a single socialist republic."
dkbfor.13.a: "A great success!"

dkbfor.14.t: "Socialist Protest Crushed in Kuban"
dkbfor.14.d: "The Revolution has been crushed in Kuban despite our best effots. With this, the only chance to spread the Revolution to the oppressed workers of Kuban is with war."
dkbfor.14.a: "Declare war at once! Workers of Kuban, your liberation is at hand!"
dkbfor.14.b: "We can't risk war with them now!"

dkbfor.15.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Meets Korkmasov"
dkbfor.15.d: "Two leaders have met recently to talk about the future of the Mountain Republic. The violent and corrupt government of the Mountain Republic, which has violently crushed socialist opposition in the country, will do anything to prevent the Caucasian peoples from the liberating light of Socialism, thus [ROOT.GetLeader] and Korkmasov have agreeed to..."
dkbfor.15.a: "...bring the Revolution, with war."
dkbfor.15.b: "...aid Socialist rebels, to bring the Revolution internally."

dkbfor.16.t: "Don Socialists Support Revolutionaries"
dkbfor.16.d: "The Reds of the Don has been aiding the Socialist rebels within our nation! This is unacceptable! If they succeed, our nation would cease to exist! What should we do?"
dkbfor.16.a: "Declare war on the rebels!"
dkbfor.16.b: "Our nation is too stable! We will never fall to socialism!"

dkbfor.17.t: "Armed Revolt in Makhachkala!"
dkbfor.17.d: "Revolutionnaries have literally started a war in Dagestan. Supported by some of the workers and peasants of Makhachkala, they are building barricades in the city centre, demanding a transition to a Socialist governemnt!"
dkbfor.17.a: "Crush them!"

dkbfor.18.t: "Socialists Crushed in Makhachkala"
dkbfor.18.d: "We managed to destroy the socialists in Dagestan. However, we still should expect a reaction from the Reds in the Don. Perhaps they will try to cross the borders and overthrow us where the rebels failled."
dkbfor.18.a: "We must strike first!"
dkbfor.18.b: "Perhaps we can co-exist?"

dkbfor.19.t: "Korkmasov Rises to Power!"
dkbfor.19.d: "The socialists have seized administrative buildings in Dagestan, soon followed by Ingushetia, Karachay-Circassia and North Ossetia. In order to avoid a bloody civil war, we are allowing Korkmasov to form a new government."
dkbfor.19.a: "The Revolution triumphant!"
dkbfor.20.t: "Rebel Victory in the Mountain Republic!"
dkbfor.20.d: "Our covert support for the rebels has worked! Korkmasov has overthrown the corrupt capitalist regime and has begun to install socialism within the former Mountain Republic. With his victory comes the question, what next? Some are calling for us to directly annex the Republic, while others say we should let them exist, but under supervision from the heirs of Red October. What shall we do?"
dkbfor.20.a: "Offer autonomy for loyalty."
dkbfor.20.b: "Annex the Mountain Republic."

dkbfor.21.t: "Rebels Crushed in the Mountain Republic!"
dkbfor.21.d: "The rebels we having been aiding the Mountain Republic have been crushed! Following new purges and arrests, Korkmasov has had to flee the country. Returning to us along with a cadre of his followers, Korkmasov is calling for us to go on the march and bring the Revolution to the people of the Northern Caccauss by force. "
dkbfor.21.a: "Korkmasov is our ally, thus we must march to war"
dkbfor.21.b: "We will not needlessly sacrifice lives."

dkbfor.22.t: "Smolensk Conference"
dkbfor.22.d: "It's been decided between ourselves and the war-weary Kaiserreich that a conference held in Smolensk would be best to help determine the future of our two nations, notably in our ambition to reclaim our lost sphere of influence. While the Germans are sure to ask for all manner of concessions in return for giving us what they believe they rightfully earned through conquest in the Weltkrieg, our diplomats are confident that their paranoia about another two-front war will ultimately force their hands at the negotiating table!"
dkbfor.22.a: "We demand our rightful borders!"

dkbfor.23.t: "The Conference Continues"
dkbfor.23.d: "The Russians have opened with their first demand, which is admittedly quite strong: Full restoration of their control over their lost Eastern territories. As heavy as these terms are, the Russians seem honest in their assurances that they will respect our territorial integrity and refrain from martial hostility in the future after the finalization of the conference, should it go their way. Of course, while we could simply agree to these opening "requests" of theirs, we remain at liberty to make some of our own counter-offers."
dkbfor.23.a: "Russia should join our alliance in return."
dkbfor.23.c: "The Baltics must remain ours."
dkbfor.23.e: "The Baltics and Belarus must remain under our protection"
dkbfor.23.f: "The Baltics and Ukraine should be in our sphere."
dkbfor.23.g: "It's better than war - fully agree to their terms."
dkbfor.23.h: "We will not agree to any of their proposals!"

dkbfor.24.t: "German Demands"
dkbfor.24.d: "Germany has agreed to our terms, but it has suggested that we join the Reichspakt - and, therefore, the war against the Communards."
dkbfor.24.a: "A small price to pay for salavation."
dkbfor.24.b: "An alliance with Germany? Never."

dkbfor.25.t: "Russia Refused!"
dkbfor.25.d: "Russia has refused the offer to join the Reichspakt. What shall we do now?"

dkbfor.26.t: "The German Response..."
dkbfor.26.d: "Our diplomats received a response from the German government this morning... and it's not entirely what we wanted to hear. While they agreed to most of our demands, they also made it clear that the Baltic shall remain as their sole zone of influence. Some in our government find those terms unacceptable, while others don't want to provoke the Germans further. What should we do now?"
dkbfor.26.a: "No point in risking a strong response. We agree."
dkbfor.26.b: "Estonia and Latvia are vital for the security of our Nation. They have to be ours."
dkbfor.26.c: "We are not a mere puppet that accepts everything thrown it's way, reject the deal!"

dkbfor.27.t: "Russia Asks for Estonia and Latvia"
dkbfor.27.d: "Russia has counter-offered with a request that the lands of Estonia and Latvia should enter their sphere, while the Baltic German city of Riga would remain exclusively in our own possession. Is this an acceptable compromise?"
dkbfor.27.a: "Deal!"
dkbfor.27.b: "No, they are our natural allies."

dkbfor.28.t: "Germany Refused!"
dkbfor.28.d: "Despite all our hopes, the accursed Germans have refused us! Perhaps this utter gall from the Teuton was to be expected. What shall we do, stop all further talks with the German Empire or agree on previous terms and simply deal with what we have? The choice remains in the hands of the executive."
dkbfor.28.a: "Agree to the previous terms."
dkbfor.28.b: "We will not agree with those dogs!"

dkbfor.29.t: "Russia Refused!"
dkbfor.29.d: "The Russians, despite our best diplomatic efforts, have refused further comrpomise! What fiends refuse offers from the Greatest Empire in the World?! These damned fools must be secretly wanting to enter into a war with us, what are our diplomats to do now?"
dkbfor.29.a: "Agree to the previous terms"
Dkbfor.29.b: "We will not agree with such dogs!"

dkbfor.30.t.: "Germany Accepts, but Asks for Compromise"
dkbfor.30.d: "Germany has agreed to our terms, but it has suggested that the Baltics and Belarus should stay in their sphere of influence. The Germans so far have been fair and reasonable in attempting to accomodate us throughout the conference, but Belarus has long been a part of the Russian nation, and the Baltics have the only warm water ports that we will possibly get in this region. We could pressure the Germans towards granting us Latvia and Estonia and let them keep Riga, while we also take Belarus, or simply be happy with just demanding Belarus return to our fold."
dkbfor.30.a: "Estonia, Latvia and Belarus should be ours."
dkbfor.30.b: "Belarus is Russia!"

dkbfor.31.t: "Russia Asks for Estonia, Latvia and Belarus"
dkbfor.31.d: "Russia has asked for Estonia, Latvia and Belarus. While such a large concession could appease the Russian Bear, it will possibly only do that much. The scale of their demands for more territory has now sparked a wave of wariness in regards to the future intentions of the Russians, with it likely only being a matter of time before they come knocking on our door for lands like Poland or, God forbid, border states in Prussia. Further, their control of such lands will put them in a prime position to strike Berlin should they ever desire to. Of course, that's all in theory and primarily borne of paranoia, but it wasn't too long ago that we fought the Weltkrieg against one another. Ultimately, the diplomats have conceded authority on the question to the Kaiser."
dkbfor.31.a: "Deal!"
dkbfor.31.b: "We can only agree on Belarus."
dkbfor.31.c: "No, they are our natural allies."

dkbfor.32.t: "Germany Has Refused"
dkbfor.32.d: "Germany has refused to give us Estonia, Latvia and Belarus. This clear act of holding back of Russia's rightful claims to sovereignty over the East must be borne out of fear out of how powerful we would become with our lands returned to us. They must prefer us weak... Or, perhaps, they already think we are far too strong, and tipping the scales between ourselves further would be too much of a provocation. Ultimately it is up to us to decide what our next course of action is."
dkbfor.32.a: "Agree to their previous terms."
dkbfor.32.b: "Relent and ask only for Belarus."
dkbfor.32.c: "We shall not agree with those wolves!"

dkbfor.33.t: "Germany Has Agreed to Give Us Only Belarus"
dkbfor.33.d: "The German stance is now firm on the issue at the conference, and it means we will only be receiving Belarus from them and nothing else. While this is certainly less than we could hope for, it is definitely a remarkable concession from the Kaiserreich regardless. We could just take the land and close the deal, or we can finally decide that cooperating with these former foes is out of the question. Of course, walking out now would show the Germans that we are likely marking a path towards war with them once more..."
dkbfor.33.a: "Deal!"
dkbfor.33.c: "We should probably walk away from these Mudaks."

dkbfor.34.t: "Russia Asked For Belarus"
dkbfor.34.d: "Russia has kept their demands relatively small compared to their opening salvo, with their request being that the land known as Belarus, or 'Ruthenia' in many of our own circles, should return to their control. A majority of our diplomats seem amenable to this, if we are to make any concessions at all, but we could also just flat out refuse the Russians here. After all, it was us who rightfully took Ruthenia during the Weltkrieg, was it not?"
dkbfor.34.a: "Deal!"
dkbfor.34.b: "No, they are our natural allies!"

dkbfor.35.d: "Germany has refused to give us Belarus."
dkbfor.35.a: "Agree to their previous terms."
dkbfor.35.b: "We don't agree."

dkbfor.36.t: "The Talks Between Us and Germany Continues"
dkbfor.36.d: "Germany has thus far remained in an agreeable moood, but they seem firm in wishing to retain both the Baltics and Ukraine in the Reichspakt. Ukraine is one of the chief desires of all of our diplomats, as its status as the Breadbasket of Europe would help alleviate the food concerns of our populace, but it's clear that the German's want to keep taking advantage of that fact themselves. It's unlikely the Germans will want to budge on Ukraine, so we could instead attempt a compromise of trying to gain some warm water ports in the form of Latvia and Estonia being granted to us... Or, our diplomats could relinquish claims to the Baltics in exchange of a second demand for Ukraine. Of course, a third option exists in the form of just demanding Ukraine and the Baltics all over again, but no one seems confident in the Kaiser being open to such a move."
dkbfor.36.a: "Let them have the Baltics, but we will take Ukraine."
dkbfor.36.b: "Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine should be in a package."
dkbfor.36.c: "We need Estonia and Latvia!"

dkbfor.37.t: "Russia Asks for Ukraine"
dkbfor.37.d: "Russia has responded with a request for Ukraine, clearly thinking their "brother nation" belongs with them once more despite our rightful gain of the territory during the Weltkrieg. Our hold over Ukraine does a lot to help assuage our population's concerns of another famine similar to the one we dealt with during the Weltkrieg, so already a lot of unease has started to grip our diplomats at the conference, but others have remarked that if Russia ends up warming relations with us through the completion of our talks here in Smolensk then we can possibly just purchase grain from them as needed. All of this, however, hinges on how confident we are in the Russian capacity for playing nice after we give in to their demands."
dkbfor.37.a: "Let's trust them, in the interests of peace."
dkbfor.37.c: "We cannot suffer another Turnip Winter!"

dkbfor.38.t: "Ukraine Stays With Germany!"
dkbfor.38.d: "The Germans are remaining stubborn, with Ukraine clearly set to stay in their sphere. Whatever their reasons may be, from fear of our growing strength or their own vulnerability to starvation, Kiev will not be returning to Russian oversight without war. We could take this as the sign to cancel everything here and now, or we can swallow our pride and just accept what we've so far gained."
dkbfor.38.a: "We must accept the previous agreement."
dkbfor.38.c: "Mudaks... Germans are always mudaks."

dkbfor.39.t: "Russia Asks for Estonia, Latvia and Ukraine"
dkbfor.39.a: "Let them have Ukraine, but the Baltics stay with us."

dkbfor.40.d: "Germany has seen the light thanks to our diplomats! They showed enough trust to hand over such an important area to us and hopefully we can move hand-in-hand into the future together."

dkbfor.43.t: "Germany Leaves the Conference"
dkbfor.43.d: "The pen has lost in Smolensk, as the Germans have left the conference without a proper treaty being signed. Our delegation has been left empty-handed and forced to return to Moscow with the worrying news that if we are to ever hope to have the East come back under our control, then we will need to seize it, just as the Germans had seized it from us back in the Weltkrieg."
dkbfor.43.a: "Their loss."

dkbfor.44.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Wants to Join Our Faction"
dkbfor.44.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has seemingly decided to harken back to our previous cooperations by asking to join our alliance. Though they lie on the far side of Eastern Europe, they might prove to be a valuable ally. How shall we respond?"
dkbfor.44.a: "Sure!"
dkbfor.44.b: "We are better off without them..."

dkbfor.45.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refused to Join Our Faction"
dkbfor.45.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused our offer to join their faction. They will have to do without our great state, and we shall forge our own path without them!"
dkbfor.45.a: "Their loss."

dkbfor.49.t: "The Don-Kuban Union Demands the Eastern Bank!"
dkbfor.49.d: "Following a period of tension among our shared border, the government of the Don has formally demanded that we hand over the Eastern Bank to them. While posing little threat, with the world being what it is, a war with the Don could prove potentially disastrous. The ultimatum placed by the Don expires in only a few hours, and they are expecting a response..."
dkbfor.49.a: "Are they joking? Denied!"
dkbfor.49.b: "We can ill afford a war with them right now. Hand it over."

dkbfor.51.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef] Refused to Ceade the Eastern Bank!" 
dkbfor.51.d: "Despite our more than generous offer, the rotten scum inhabiting [FROM.GetNameDef] have refused to accept our gracious demands. It seems they are willing to keep our brethren under their prison of nations, a situation that has to change if our collective nationhood is to be whole one day."
dkbfor.51.a: "The absolute gall, who do they think they are!"
dkbfor.51.b: "We won't let this go, to war!"

dkbfor.52.t: "The Smolensk Conference"
dkbfor.52.d: "We have decided to hold a Conference in Smolensk between us and the Kaiserreich, to decide the future of our two nations. Our country is rebuilt and the Reich still holds many lands formally belonging to the Tsardom. We must claim our sphere of influence and hope that the Reich will agree. Of course, there is no guarantee of success, but with our ties stronger then ever, we are in the best possible possession for a peaceful reclamation of our lands."
dkbfor.52.a: "Request the return of Belarus and Ukraine!"
dkbfor.52.b: "...and Lithuania and the Baltics!"

dkbfor.53.t: "Russia Requests White Ruthenia and Ukraine" #for Germany
dkbfor.53.d: "Following the solidification of a pro-German government over Russia, the resurgent Tsardom has petitioned our government for their former lands in the East. Asking specifically for the lands of Ukraine and Belarus, the Tsardom claims that a Russian administration would do much better then the current native governments in place. While such a transfer would simply be handing lands over to an ensured ally, the looming threat of losing their freedom once again to a Russian boot is not an appealing thought for many within the East. Regardless, the choice stands before us, to aid our ally, or hinder them."
dkbfor.53.a: "They have been independent for nearly 20 years, we shall not allow this!"
dkbfor.53.b: "May our friendship last a thousand years!"

dkbfor.54.t: "Russia Requests Her Eastern Lands" 
dkbfor.54.d: "Following the solidification of a pro-German government over Russia, the resurgent Tsardom has petitioned over government for their former lands in the East. Asking for all their former lands save Poland, the Tsardom claims that a Russian administration would do much better then the current native governments in place. While such a transfer would simply be handing lands over to an ensured ally, the looming threat of losing their freedom once again to a Russian boot is not an appealing thought for many within the East. Regardless, the choice stands before us, to aid our ally, or hinder them."
dkbfor.54.a: "They have been independent for nearly 20 years, we shall not allow this!"
dkbfor.54.b: "May our friendship last a thousand years!"

dkbfor.55.t: "Germany Leaves the Conference"
dkbfor.55.d: "As he saw the Germans, he knew what it meant. It was the end of the conference, and there was nothing gained from either side. Dimitri left with his colleague heading back to the hotel the Russian Delegation has been attending during the whole conference. It was a building not fit for a person, let alone an international delegation. This whole conference stunk of Germany doing this to save face. As he returned to his room Dimitri wrote up a report informing the Government of what had happened."
dkbfor.55.a: "Damn"

dkbfor.58.t: "The Germans Agreed!!"
dkbfor.58.d: "Despite our wildest hopes and dreams, the German government has formally agreed to the transfer of the request lands back into Russian hands. All that remains for this historic transfer of lands is the signing off of the local governments. Surely they are loyal enough to Berlin to go along with it, right?"
dkbfor.58.a: "A Victory for Peace?"

dkbfor.56.t: "At Death's Door" #for the countries that Germany agrees to let Russia annex"
dkbfor.56.d: "Following a conference between the German and Russian Empires, the Kaiser has formally signed off on the transfer of our lands to the Russian Bear. While such an outcome is shocking, it is not unexpected. With their agreement, the Reich has come knocking, demanding we hand control of the state over to Moscow. While duty demands that we kneel before Moscow, we could always just turn down the demand, and fight for our survival."
dkbfor.56.a: "We won't go quietly, the Tsar can count on that."
dkbfor.56.b: "We are loyal to Berlin, to the end. (Annexation into Russia)"

dkbfor.57.t: "[FROM.GetNameDef]  Refuses Incorporation!"
dkbfor.57.d: "Following German agreement to hand over the lands of [FROM.GetNameDef], their stubborn government has refused to peacefully join their true Motherland. With their refusal, the drums of war have been sounded, and shall not be quieted until we march on their capital!"
dkbfor.57.a: "What about 'One and Indivisible' do they not understand?"

dkbfor.100.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Demands Land"
dkbfor.100.d: "Claiming that the majority of these territories are their rightful, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has demanded we cede this territory to them."
dkbfor.100.a: "These lands our rightful ours! We will stand our ground!"
dkbfor.100.b: "Peace is always preferable to war."
dkbfor.100.c: "Everything for our allies!"

dkbfor.101.t: "[FROM.GetName] Returns Our Land"
dkbfor.101.d: "Following our demands, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has agreed to cede our claimed land to their rightful owners.."
dkbfor.101.a: "The pen is mightier then the sword."

dkbfor.102.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refuses to Cede Land!"
dkbfor.102.d: "Unfortunately, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has refused to cede us our rightful territory! How shall we deal with this going forward?"
dkbfor.102.a: "They called our bluff; we are not ready for war."
dkbfor.102.b: "They want to do this the hard war way? So be it."

DKU_Ourselves_Alone: "Ourselves Alone"

DKU_Rely_On_Russia_desc: "Russia, the closest World Power to our great state, has a long and turbid history with our people. Regardless, they are our best option to choose as a benefactor given their proximity and existing ties to our economy. In order to facilitate better relations between our two nations and rapidly repair our economy, we should rely on Germany in our future economic development."

DKU_Mechanization_Of_Agriculture: "Mechanization of Agriculture"
DKU_Mechanization_Of_Agriculture_desc: "Our nation is still largely agricultural-base and agrarian, with much of the industry expected of a modern state sorely missing within our borders. We should take notes from the modern farming techniques used in other nations by mechanizing our agri-industry. With new motorized tractors, crop processing plants, and other wonders of the industrial age, we shall lift our farmers up out of the dirt and into the future."

DKU_Industrialize_Kuban: "Industrialize [ROOT.GetName]"
DKU_Industrialize_Kuban_desc: "With our deeply agrarian roots, industry has always been solely lacking within our nation. A sweeping industrialisation push is much needed for our country to compete with our neighbors in the region. The skies that rise high above our land between the two seas shall grow black with the smoke of progress as we burst forth into modernity!"

DKU_Subsidize_German_Business: "Subsidize German Business"
DKU_Subsidize_German_Business_desc: "In the wake of Black Monday, Germany has become our main trade partner and financial benefactor. To further aid them, German businesses should be subsidized and be given preferential treatments, so that they may invest more capital into our country's economic development."

DKU_Duty_Free_For_Russians: "Duty-Free Policies For Russians"
DKU_Duty_Free_For_Russians_desc: "Since the economic collapse wrought by Black Monday, our financial ties with Moscow have only grown stronger.

DKU_Kuban_Oil_Production: "Oil Production"
DKU_Kuban_Oil_Production_desc: "The region of Ciscaucasia and the lands that straddle both the Black Sea and Caspian are blessed with bountiful reserves of oil.

DKU_Join_Mitteleuropa: "Join Mitteleuropa"

DKU_Recognize_Russian_Currency: "Recognize Russian Currency in [ROOT.GetName]"
DKU_Recognize_Russian_Currency_desc: "With our economic links with Russia only growing, their currency has become increasingly common in our markets. Our citizens should be able to use Russian Rouble equally with our national currency to further our integration into the Russian economic sphere."

DKU_Stabilization: "Stabilisation"
DKU_Stabilization_desc: "With a mountain of reforms and new policies passed, Black Monday is slowly becoming a distant memory to our people. Though it still has left its scars on the nation, our economy has, for the most part, stabilized in the wake of the Berlin Stock Crisis. With the shock and collapse behind us, our economic future has never looked brighter."

DKU_A_Cossack_Army: "A Cossack Army"
DKU_A_Cossack_Army_desc: "Cossack heritage runs deep in our veins and martial traditions. We should capitalize on these roots and officially make Cossak strategy and customs a part of our armed forces. Their proud history shall become the bedrock of our modern military."

DKU_New_Doctrine_For_Cossacks: "Adopt New Doctrine"
DKU_New_Doctrine_For_Cossacks_desc: "With the Russian Civil War and the Weltkrieg behind us and the threat of new war on the horizon, we can no longer rely on the stale theories of yesterday. New doctrine and strategum must be developed, and old ideas reformed and modernized, in order to stand a chance on the battlefields of tomorrow."

DKU_Import_German_Equipment: "Import German Equipment"
DKU_Import_German_Equipment_desc: "As the victors of the last great war, it stands to reason that German equipment is among the best in the world. Manufacturers of weapons of war like Mauser and Krupp are titans of the arms industry for good reason, as their reputation precedes them. We should reach out to these companies and others like them to import their equipment at once."

DKU_Import_Russian_Equipment: "Import Russian Equipment"
DKU_Import_Russian_Equipment_desc: "Though they conceded to the Germans in the Weltkrieg, Russian equipment was proven tried and true in the fires of the Russian Civil War. Rapidly making gains in military technology since then, and with their technical know-how and famous manufactures like the Tula Arms Plant behind our war industry, our army shall become as mighty as the Russian Bear."

DKU_Modern_Tactics: "Modern Tactics"
DKU_Modern_Tactics_desc: "Modern warfare will require modern tactics. We can not win the wars of tomorrow with dead ideas of the past. We must not let the next war devolve into the slogging horror that was the Weltkrieg, so new solutions must be imagined. Without developing modern tactics, we will be consumed by those who surround who have!"

DKU_Produce_More_Equipment: "Produce More Equipment"
DKU_Produce_More_Equipment_desc: "With our growing armies and our new doctrines developed, the demand for fresh equipment has never been higher. We must expand quotas, build new factories, hire more workers, and anything else we can do to increase our industrial output. Every hand a rifle!"

DKU_Military_Industrial_Complex: "Military-Industrial Complex"
DKU_Military_Industrial_Complex_desc: "Our private defense industry shall pursue far closer ties with the military and military’s administration in order to smooth cooperation between the two. Like two pieces of the same puzzle, they shall feed off each other, rapidly fueling the rise of our military’s size and strength while also furthering their influence in our government."

DKU_Modernize_Artillery: "Modernize Artillery"
DKU_Modernize_Artillery_desc: "Modern artillery’s effectiveness has been proven since its inception in the 19th century, being used in every major conflict on Earth since. The next war shall likely be no different, so we must keep pace with the times and our neighbors by modernizing our arsenal at once. Larger and more accurate guns will be needed for the next war so that we may reign fire down upon our potential foes."

DKU_Standartized_Equipment_Production: "Standardized Equipment Production"
DKU_Standartized_Equipment_Production_desc: "Lighting fast production speeds will be needed if our industry is to keep pace with any future foe. To streamline production and increase outputs, sweeping standardization codes will be drafted, setting official manufacturing guidelines on every piece of equipment we make. All tools and manufacturing equipment will be modified, or if impossible replaced, in order to match the new standards. Though this might slow production down temporarily as factories are refitted, the future benefit to our production speeds will be well worth it."

DKU_Tanks_Of_Don: "The Armored Columns of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Tanks_Of_Don_desc: "Tanks, while only introduced towards the end of the Weltkrieg, shocked the world with their ingenuity and effectiveness, both as weapons of war and weapons of intimidation. Though the lumbering behemoths of the past will likely not prove effective in future wars, updating and modernizing the concept with the creation of fresh designs might yield success. Using foreign influences, chiefly from Russia and Germany, we shall develop a new line of tanks fitting for our state."

DKU_A_New_Army: "A New Army"
DKU_A_New_Army_desc: "Our current army is a relic of the past; lying disorganized and outmoded as archaic artefacts of the past. With our new doctrines developed and new equipment being produced, this will all soon change. Even now, the troops are being drilled on how to use their new tools of war and how to understand our new tactics and doctrine. Our new army shall be the pride of the state, serving as sword and shield for the people of our great nation."

DKU_A_Cossack_Airforce: "A Cossack Airforce"
DKU_A_Cossack_Airforce_desc: "The spirit of the Cossacks shall take wing and fly with the creation of an official, independent airforce for our nation. Previously, what few planes available to our military’s use that wasn't a cargo plane were tied to the army’s beck and call. Though they shall still cooperate, and their Cossack roots will continue to bind them, an independent air force will allow our flyboys a greater degree of freedom in their development."

DKU_Expand_Airfields: "Expand Airfields"
DKU_Expand_Airfields_desc: "With the advent of air warfare, planes have become increasingly emphasized and utilized by powers around the world as they realized the wide range of potential applications for aircraft. Our state is no different, and in order to better support our burgeoning air force, we shall expand airfields across the nation so that more planes can be stored at the ready and so more pilots can be trained."

DKU_Fighters_For_Don: "The Fighter Squadrons of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Fighters_For_Don_desc: "Fighter planes first proved their effectiveness in dogfights and anti-bomber missions in the Weltkrieg and the Russian Civil War, capturing the attention of the world with their near-mythic and seemingly death-defying pursuits. With their uses proven on the battlefield, it is almost guaranteed that they will be needed in the next war as well. We shall construct as many as we can, so that we may act as beehive of sorts, releasing a swarm once threatened, blocking out the sun with our wings and drowning out the screams of our enemies with the roar of engines and propellers."

DKU_Bombers_For_Don: "The Bomber wings of [ROOT.GetAdjective]"
DKU_Bombers_For_Don_desc: "The sheer devastation even a single bomber can unleash was first witnessed in the fires of the Weltkrieg, and their effectiveness has only increased since with better planes and larger bombs. We will double down on their production and fill the skies with our bombers, ready to unleash hell on any who would dare march against us."

DKU_Secure_The_Sky: "Secure the Sky"
DKU_Secure_The_Sky_desc: "The security of our sovereign airspace must be maintained at all times. If we allow any enemy to achieve aerial superiority over our great state, the results would be catastrophic. This must never be allowed to occur. Anti-air emplacements will spread to dot the nation as a shield against stray foes while our air force shall be the sword, meeting their prey head on in the clouds. The skies of our home shall be ours and ours alone."

DKU_The_Black_Sea_Fleet: "The Black Sea Fleet"
DKU_The_Black_Sea_Fleet_desc: "The Black Sea serves as our gateway into the wider world and the chief artery of our economy. Without it, our nation would surely collapse. To protect our naval assets and our shores, the Black Sea Fleet must rise, renovated and reformed from the ashes of our current sorry excuse for a naval force. New ships shall be constructed and old ones refitted in our quest to achieve security and perhaps primacy in our home sea."

DKU_Port_Of_Capital: "Port of Rostov"
DKU_Port_Of_Capital_desc: "A new grand port shall be created on the coast of the Black Sea, serving as the center of our new naval expansion and reformation efforts. With a new access point into this major artery, our naval influence in our waters shall only increase, as does too our output of naval equipment and the ability to maintain it."

DKU_Ukranian_Exercises: "[ROOT.GetAdjective]-Ukranian Naval Exercises"
DKU_Ukranian_Exercises_desc: "Ukraine is one of our closest neighbors and has always served as a major partner in the region, especially when it comes to nautical matters. To further this cooperation, joint naval exercises will be held with the Ukranian Navy to help both of our naval staffs to gain real experience."

DKU_Defend_Coast: "Protecting the Black Sea Lifeline"
DKU_Defend_Coast_desc: "Though influential on its waters and important to us, the Black Sea is shared with many other peoples. From rival nations to pirates, these waters are never truly safe. We must ensure the security of our convoys through the application of new patrol routes while also arming the crews of our convoys in case of pirate boardings. Our mercantile fleet must be kept safe, as they are the lifeline of our nation."

DKU_Submarine_Effort: "Submarine Effort"
DKU_Submarine_Effort_desc: "Submarines shocked the world with their effectiveness in the last great war and ever since, their concept has deeply intrigued our naval staff. With new naval infrastructure in place and new funding allocated to their budget, the Navy has moved to pursue development on our own submarine models. We too shall become wolves of the sea."

DKU_Invest_In_Shipbuilding: "Invest In Shipbuilding"
DKU_Invest_In_Shipbuilding_desc: "New ships are a necessity for the formation of any great navy, and our state is no exception. New naval infrastructure will be created in order to further speed up shipbuilding efforts, while more dock workers and engineers will be hired to speed up their work. We shall soon have a navy worthy of our proud state!"

DKU_Produce_Cruisers: "Produce Cruisers"
DKU_Produce_Cruisers_desc: "Cruisers are just about the largest ships our state is capable of manufacturing in any reasonable amount of time while still being able to maintain them post-launch. They serve as fantastic light to medium warships that can fill a variety of roles and, while not as large as the battleships of the Great Powers, they can still outgun or outrun most other vessels they’d come across. With this in mind, our state has gone ahead and okayed a new push on cruiser development and production. They shall serve as the flagships of our new fleet; our powerful Pearls of the Black Sea."

DKB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Initially created in 1918 in direct opposition to the Bolsheviks, the Don Republic would be reincorporated into Russia following a White victory. Due to disagreements with Kerensky, the Don Cossacks would join the failed coup by former Supreme Leader Kolchak in 1925. Due to German involvement with the Coup’s aftermath, the Don was granted a renewed independence from Russia. In the time since then, the Don Host has become home to a variety of movements, from Socialists hiding in the shadows to General Vlasov and his Commitee with suchs to liberate Russia. With their German lifeline faulting day by day, the future of the Don and perhaps all of Russia hangs in the balance."
KUB_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "Proclaimed in 1918, Kuban People's Republic was on the right side of the hedge in the chaos of the Russian Civil War. A stable economic growth, democracy and cooperation made it possible for Kuban to become one of the most successful splinter states of the Russian Empire. Unceasing conflicts between two parliamentary groups, pro-Ukranian and pro-Russian ensured good relations both with Russia and Reichspakt. However, who knows if it is not just a calm before the storm."
MTR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Mountain Republic is a good example of how more than 18 nationalities live together in one country. Since 1918 Tapa Chermoyev, a Chechen oil industrialist and millioner has been in control, which quickly turned the state into an oligarchic republic. The discontent with the government is growing and the society is radicalizing, with socialists and islamists getting more and more powerful. Will Chermoyev secure his shaky rule?"

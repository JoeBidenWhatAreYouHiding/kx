### Focuses ###

ITA_Italy_Looks_Out:0 "Italy Looks Out"
ITA_Italy_Looks_Out_desc:0 "With Italy reunited under the authority of its only legitimate government, we can finally look outwards and establish our position on the international stage on a par with the other great European powers. Italy is one and will never again be divided by the action of power-hungry foreign powers, Avanti!"
ITA_Consolidate_Italy:0 "Consolidate Italy"
ITA_Consolidate_Italy_desc:0 "After many years, and a grueling war, we have finally defeated our rival governments and reunited Italy, with our soldiers marching on to quell what little resistance remains. Indeed, this is a historical moment for all Italians, but now we must consolidate our control over these liberated lands, and free its people from the oppression of the defeated government."
ITA_Irredentism:0 "Reclaim Italia Irredenta!"
ITA_Irredentism_desc:0 "While we may have taken back the south of Italy, we cannot stop and fully declare victory yet. Millions of Italians live outside of their homeland, under the banners of a foreign government, and in areas that are historically ours by right. We must be willing to press our claims and expand our borders to free our brothers and sisters!"
ITA_Claim_Northeast:0 "Rescue the Northeast"
ITA_Claim_Northeast_desc:0  "A sore reminder of our past failures still remains in the Northeast, with Austrian boots in Tirolo and Istria. This cannot be the case any longer, and already many Italians across the nation have called for us to liberate our loyal citizens and reclaim Trieste, Fiume, and other lands that were once ours. Now is the time for retribution!"
ITA_Claim_Italian_Switzerland:0 "Minorities in Ticino"
ITA_Claim_Italian_Switzerland_desc:0 "The Swiss dishonor us with their unwillingness to recognise our claims on lands they currently occupy. Many Italians clamor in Lugano, wanting to reunify with us. A plebiscite shall be held to determine their future, and we will do our best to make this dream of thousands come true."
ITA_Claim_East_Africa:0 "Reviving our East African Ambitions"
ITA_Claim_East_Africa_desc:0 "Much like the other nations of Europe, Italy was on the course towards becoming a colonial power in Africa. During the Berlin Conference we secured our claim to Eritrea and Somalia in the strategic Horn of Africa. Our attempts to unite our two colonies came to a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Ethiopians at Adwa. To make matters worse, the loss of our African colonies during the Weltkrieg spelled all but the end of our African aims. As a united Italy rises once again from the ashes, we shall set off once again to Asmara and Mogadishu, and finally settle our score with the so-called ‘King of Kings’."
ITA_Claim_Malta:0 "Our Ties in Malta"
ITA_Claim_Malta_desc:0 "While Malta may be a small island, that does not make it any less Italian than it already is. Its historical ties with Sicily are more than enough proof that it is indeed a part of our nation like any other. Not only that, but it is also a fairly strategic position for naval operations. If we take the island back, it will be one less threat to face against."
ITA_Claim_Libya:0 "Take Back Libya"
ITA_Claim_Libya_desc:0 "When we defeated the Ottoman Empire in 1912, Libya was the greatest of all the spoils of that war, and a triumph that placed our kingdom in leagues with the likes of France and Britain. Now with the Ottomans exposed and at their weakest, we must strike once again, and take back Libya!"
ITA_Successful_Irredentist:0 "Greater Italia Reclaimed!"
ITA_Successful_Irredentist_desc:0 "Finally, we have triumphed. Against all the odds that were stacked against us, we have not only managed to reunite the peninsula, but also our colonies and lost territories under one flag and nation. Our age of humiliation is at an end, and now we stand tall as one of the great powers of the world. But we will not stop there - soon, the world shall know the might of Italy as it once had during the age of Rome! Onwards, to victory!"
ITA_Neutrality:0 "A New Direction"
ITA_Neutrality_desc:0 "With Italy now beginning to once again stand on her own two feet for the first time since the end of the War, we stand at a cross roads. With it being obvious that war between Germany and the French will flare up once again, many have begun calling for us to join arms with a global faction, and stand with them in their crusade against Radicalism. However, while the Syndicalists may have brought division to Italy, we have no bone to pick with them. Why fight a war that we have no part in? Instead, let us cast aside any alliances, and simply defend our borders. Blessed are the Peacemakers after all, and we have no need to cause war."
ITA_Interventionism:0 "Italy and Her Allies"
ITA_Interventionism_desc:0 "With the second Risorgimento completed, we have now found our footing on the world stage once more - now is the time for us to reclaim our greater legacy as Italians!"
ITA_Join_Germany:0 "Alliance with the Kaiser"
ITA_Join_Germany_desc:0 "It is only obvious that we should stand besides the Kaiser. If we are to secure our homeland, we must have a strong ally, and who better than the German Empire? If we send an envoy to Berlin to request entrance into the Reichspakt they will be sure to accept, especially considering our border with the Commune of France. Together, our nations will stand second to none!"
ITA_Join_Austria:0 "A Visit to Vienna"
ITA_Join_Austria_desc:0 "Though our history with the Austrians has been tense to say the least, we cannot deny that they are better as allies than enemies. After all, a repeat of the humiliation brought to us during the Weltkrieg certainly means doom for our nation. Their close proximity and considerable military force ensures that we can rely on their support in these turbulent times."
ITA_Join_Canada:0 "Stand with the Entente Once More"
ITA_Join_Canada_desc:0 "The Entente would be able to help us defend ourselves with their mighty navy. They can use an ally, and so can we. When Italy had joined the Entente in 1915, we were bolstered by the idea of gaining new territories and exerting our influence; it was tragic to see how much we had underestimated the Austrians, with our incompetent military and generals bringing the nation to ruin had it not been for sheer luck. Now we have learnt from our past, and have grown stronger as a result. With the French exiles to our south, and the Canadians with their impressive navy, we can honour the treaty of London and rejoin the Entente, freeing us from the ires of the Kaiserreich or the Habsburgs."
ITA_Our_Own_Faction:0 "An Italian Sphere!"
ITA_Our_Own_Faction_desc:0 "We don't need the support of any other nation but our own - we owe no favors to the Germans, Austrians, Canadians or any other. It was by our own hands that we reunited Italy, and so it must be our hands that will bring Italy into the future, an Italian future created by Italian Strength! Viva Italia!"
ITA_Join_Russia:0 "Join Arms with the Rus"
ITA_Join_Russia_desc:0 "Though many would regard the Russians as a relatively unorthodox choice for an alliance, they are a natural enemy of the Germans and Austrians alike. As a rising power much like them, this could present a golden opportunity for our shared might to sweep across Europe, molding the future in our image without the Syndicalist, the Hun or the weak husks of old powers."
ITA_Isolationism:0 "Put the Defense of Italy First!"
ITA_Isolationism_desc:0 "Already we had seen our beloved Italia torn apart once by our enemies and rebels, and it was no small feat to bring it back together. To overstep our bounds and misjudge our ambitions as we did during the Weltkrieg will lead to disaster. We must look to protect our nation and its current borders."
ITA_Northern_Frontier:0 "Secure the Northern Frontier"
ITA_Northern_Frontier_desc:0 "One of the main reasons behind our humiliation at the hands of the Austrians was our lack of properly fortified defences. Never again shall we expose our lands so easily - reinforcing our borders will certainly keep them at bay."
ITA_Western_Frontier:0 "Prepare Against the Communards"
ITA_Western_Frontier_desc:0 "With the Commune of France seeking to reclaim their lost lands, many in our government have grown concerned. If they can so easily demand land from the Swiss, then what stops them from encroaching on our territories? As a measure of national security, we will construct military fortifications around Piedmont, as a warning to the Syndicalists and a message for the Italian people - we will not back down!"
ITA_Nationalization:0 "New Nationalist Thought"
ITA_Nationalization_desc:0 "Many people, revanchists and nationalists mostly, have recently spoken out against our new foreign policies, viewing it as a betrayal of our brothers entrapped by foreign boots. It is vital that we educate them that this is the only solution for a better Italy, and gain their support before it is too late."
ITA_Guard_the_Coasts:0 "Guard the Coasts"
ITA_Guard_the_Coasts_desc:0 "Our unique geography brings along with it many boons, but also some issues. Much of our coastlines are unprotected and leaves us exposed to naval invasions. To counter this, we should invest in fortifications across our most vulnerable coasts."

italy_shared.70.t:0 "The Italians in Switzerland"
italy_shared.70.d:0 "The state of Ticino is home to a large Italian population, which has warmly received the news of [From.GetNameDef]'s irredentist claims on Italian lands. Today, the [From.GetAdjective] government has taken a more aggressive stance regarding Ticino and officially requested that we organise a referendum on whether its population wishes to remain a part of [Root.GetNameDef] or join [From.GetNameDef]."
italy_shared.70.a:0 "They must be joking, right?"
italy_shared.70.b:0 "Accept their proposal, call up a referendum on the matter"

italy_shared.71.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
italy_shared.71.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has declined our proposal for a fair and democratic referendum on Italian-inhabited Ticino. What should we do now? Should we forget the matter or threaten them with war?"

italy_shared.76.d:0 "[aggressor.GetNameDef], in a clear violation of Swiss neutrality, has invaded the Swiss province of Ticino under the claim that Switzerland refuses to allow a referendum of the Italians living there regarding whether they wish to rejoin their homeland. This is a clear breach of international law and, as a prime power in Europe, we have the duty to warn [aggressor.GetNameDef] they must stop this madness or face the consequences."
italy_shared.76.a:0 "This is not of our concern"
italy_shared.76.b:0 "Guarantee Switzerland's borders"

italy_shared.77.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Ultimatum"
italy_shared.77.d:0 "Upon hearing news of our ongoing intervention in Switzerland, [From.GetNameDef] has warned us to halt the offensive, pull back to our borders and call an end to hostilities, unless we want to face [From.GetAdjective] arms."

italy_shared.77.b:0 "We will not respond to their threats"

italy_shared.78.d:0 "Italian and [From.GetAdjective] forces have exchanged fire inside the territory of Ticino, with some artillery fire also hitting Italian lands. With casualties now reaching the hundreds in both sides, we must decide on whether to pull back or escalate the conflict and officially declare war on [From.GetNameDef]."

italy_shared.78.b:0 "Order a general mobilisation and declare war"

italy_shared.81.t:0 "Ticino Referendum - Italian Defeat"
italy_shared.81.d:0 "As agreed, a referendum to decide the fate of Ticino was called, and its inhabitants voted to remain a part of [From.GetNameDef]. Nonetheless, some members of our cabinet still favour a military solution to the situation and propose an invasion of the disputed territory."

italy_shared.81.b:0 "Cross the border and seize Ticino"

italy_shared.82.t:0 "The Italians Control Ticino"
italy_shared.82.d:0 "The war with the Italians is going poorly. Currently they have full control over Ticino, and we are quickly losing ground. Is the canton truly worth fighting for, and even risking complete annexation?"
italy_shared.82.a:0 "Send the envoys and offer to surrender Ticino"

italy_shared.83.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sues for Peace"

italy_shared.83.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
italy_shared.83.b:0 "This war won't stop until we're marching on [From.Capital.GetName]!"

italy_shared.84.t:0 "We Are Losing the War"
italy_shared.84.d:0 "What a disaster! We thought that a quick war would be enough to capture Ticino. Instead, they not only repealed our attacks, but made incursions into [Root.GetNameDef] itself! We must back down in order to avoid an even greater shame."

italy_shared.84.b:0 "We can still win this!"

italy_shared.85.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sues for Peace"

italy_shared.90.t:0 "An Italian Offer for Malta"
italy_shared.90.d:0 "Malta is home to a sizeable Italian community, dating back to the Roman and Middle Ages, although it is, currently, controlled by us as a colony. Today, [From.GetNameDef] has come up with a proposal for buying Malta from us. Should we accept the offer? The island-fortress is a symbol of our power in the Mediterranean, so by ceding control over it we'd lose some prestige... however, we would continue to have access to its harbours and cultivate a relationship with Italy as a result."
italy_shared.90.a:0 "Accept their offer, we don't need Malta that much anymore"
italy_shared.90.b:0 "Malta is necessary for the security of the Mediterranean"

italy_shared.91.t:0 "[From.GetName] Accepts our Offer"
italy_shared.91.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has accepted our offer for Malta! We have taken another step towards our goal!"

italy_shared.93.d:0 "The Italians have threatened us with a war if we don't cede control over Malta to them immediately!"
italy_shared.93.a:0 "Right, right, we don't even need Malta that much anyway..."

italy_shared.94.t:0 "The [From.GetName] Submits"
italy_shared.94.d:0 "Our ultimatum has succeeded - Malta is now ours!"

italy_shared.95.t:0 "Malta in Italian Hands"
italy_shared.95.d:0 "Disaster! The island-fortress of Malta has been captured by the damn Italians! The masses are already protesting in the streets of [Root.Capital.GetName], as they see no point in fighting for a small rock on the Mediterranean."

italy_shared.100.d:0 "Tunisia is home to a large Italian community, dating back to the Middle Ages - as a matter of fact, even today, Italians make up nearly half of the local population. This morning, [From.GetNameDef] has come up with a proposal to buy that territory from us. Should we accept the offer? Most of our people are against the proposal, though there are benefits in developing [From.GetNameDef] as an ally, and we would retain the use of bases there."

italy_shared.131.a:0 "Huzzah!"

italy_shared.132.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses our Offer"
italy_shared.132.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has turned down our offer for [LBA.GetName]! What should we do now?"
italy_shared.132.a:0 "Threaten them with war"
italy_shared.132.b:0 "It is too risky..."

italy_shared.133.t:0 "An Italian Ultimatum"
italy_shared.133.d:0 "The Italians have threatened us with a war if we don't cede control over [LYB.GetNameDef] to them immediately!"
italy_shared.133.a:0 "Right, right, we don't even need [LBA.GetNameDef] that much anyway..."
italy_shared.133.b:0 "Such insolence will be punished!"

italy_shared.134.t:0 "[From.GetName] Submits"
italy_shared.134.d:0 "Our ultimatum has succeeded - [LBA.GetNameDef] is now ours!"
italy_shared.134.a:0 "Huzzah!"

italy_shared.135.t:0 "The Italians are Losing"
italy_shared.135.d:0 "The foolish [aggressor.GetName] is losing this war, and we are in a position to end it now while also demanding concessions from the Italians - at the very least to surrender all claims to [LBA.GetNameDef]. Should we do so?"
italy_shared.135.a:0 "Send an envoy to demand peace and concessions"
italy_shared.135.b:0 "This war won't be over until we're marching on Rome!"

italy_shared.136.t:0 "[From.GetName] Offers Peace"
italy_shared.136.d:0 "We are losing the war with [From.GetNameDef], and now the [From.GetAdjective] government has offered us a white peace - provided we give up any and all claims to [LBA.GetAdjective] territory, as well as grant them concessions. Failure to do so may mean this war drags on interminably."
italy_shared.136.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
italy_shared.136.b:0 "No, we can still win this!"

italy_shared.137.t:0 "[LYB.GetName] has been Overrun"
italy_shared.137.d:0 "The war with the Italians is dragging on, and what's worse is that they've already overrun [LYB.GetNameDef]. Getting it back would be costly - would it not be better to sue for peace now and surrender the disputed territory?"
italy_shared.137.a:0 "Sign a peace treaty and cede [LBA.GetNameDef] to the Italians"
italy_shared.137.b:0 "No, we can still win this!"

italy_shared.138.t:0 "[From.GetName] Sues for Peace"
italy_shared.138.d:0 "We are winning the war with [From.GetNameDef], and after losing [LBA.GetName] to our forces they have sued for peace, offering to let us have the disputed territories - no questions asked."
italy_shared.138.a:0 "Yes, let's end this now"
italy_shared.138.b:0 "This war won't be over until we're marching on [From.Capital.GetName]!"

italy_shared.139.t:0 "Integration of Libya"
italy_shared.139.d:0 "We have consolidated our hold on Libya fully. The time has come to integrate them into our administrative structures."

italy_shared.140.t:0 "Libya Eludes Us"
italy_shared.140.d:0 "The war is over, and we have failed to gain our foothold in North Africa. Our irredentist dreams have been dashed, it seems."
italy_shared.140.a:0 "For now, perhaps"

italy_shared.141.t:0 "Our New Italian Masters"
italy_shared.141.d:0 "The [From.From.GetAdjective] government has betrayed us and sold us to [From.GetNameDef] like a trinket at the market. If we resist, we will be crushed under their heel...but can we truly stand for this?"
italy_shared.141.a:0 "We will submit to our new masters"
italy_shared.141.b:0 "Never! We will fight for our independence!"

italy_shared.142.t:0 "[From.GetName] Rebels"
italy_shared.142.d:0 "It appears that [From.GetName] does not take kindly to being sold by [From.From.From.GetNameDef], and has declared that it will fight for its independence from [Root.GetAdjective] rule!"
italy_shared.142.a:0 "We've no time for this - let them go"
italy_shared.142.b:0 "Oh, really? That won't last long"

italy_shared.18.t:0 "Italy Seeks to Join Faction"
italy_shared.18.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has sent diplomats, seeking to join the [Root.GetAdjective]-led faction for the benefit of both parties. Failing that, they request [Root.GetNameDef]'s protection, and in return will allow [Root.GetAdjective] troops access through their territory."
italy_shared.18.a:0 "Admit them into the faction"
italy_shared.18.b:0 "We will guarantee their independence instead"
italy_shared.18.c:0 "They are on their own"

italy_shared.19.t:0 "Italy Seeks Protection"
italy_shared.19.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has sent diplomats, seeking Root.GetNameDef]'s protection of their borders, and in return will allow [Root.GetAdjective] troops access through their territory."
italy_shared.19.a:0 "That sounds like an excellent deal"
italy_shared.19.b:0 "They are on their own"

italy_shared.20.t:0 "[From.GetName] Agrees"
italy_shared.20.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has agreed that [Root.GetNameDef] will be a useful addition to their faction. An alliance between the two nations has now been created."
italy_shared.20.a:0 "We have thrown our lot in with theirs..."

italy_shared.21.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Protection"
italy_shared.21.d:0 "[From.GetNameDef] has offered [From.GetAdjective] protection of [Root.GetNameDef] continued independence, in exchange for military access through our territory."
italy_shared.21.a:0 "That sounds like a good deal"
italy_shared.21.b:0 "Absolutely ludicrous! Deny this spit in our face at once!"

italy_shared.22.t:0 "[From.GetName] Refuses"
italy_shared.22.d:0 "Diplomats from [From.GetNameDef] have refused any offers of alliance or requests for the protection of [Root.GetAdjective] independence. We are on our own."

italy_shared.23.t:0 "[new_italian_core.GetName] Under Our Control"
italy_shared.23.d:0 "Our control over [new_italian_core.GetName] has finally been consolidated! It is now considered an integral part of [Root.GetNameDef]."
italy_shared.23.a:0 "Long live [Root.GetNameDef]!"

italy_shared.24.t:0 "The Italians Bark Back"
italy_shared.24.d:0 "Though our counteroffer was generous while also necessarily taking into account the sheer fragility of the current global order, the ruling Italian regime has denied our offer of aid and guarantees to their maintained national sovereignty. Their government has decided to look elsewhere on the diplomatic stage for allies and compatriots, while our alliance will soldier ever onwards, with or without the ever-squabbling Italians."
italy_shared.24.a:0 "So be it. We can find better allies and better wine elsewhere!"

italy_shared.25.t:0 "A New Direction for Italy’s Future"
italy_shared.25.d:0 "With our last overtures and talks of cooperation failing miserably, our diplomatic delegation, instead of returning to Rome, has instead been instructed to immediately make preparations for a trip to another one of the great alliances’ capitals to quickly and urgently find a new alliance for our newly stabilized and unified pan-Italian regime to seek shelter within. Though we have stabilized, the rest of the World has long been on a collision course with absolute disaster, and we must be ready for when this chaos reaches our own borders. So, where shall we send our delegation?"
italy_shared.25.a:0 "Petition the Kaiser in Vienna."
italy_shared.25.b:0 "We shall look to the Kaiser in Berlin instead."
italy_shared.25.c:0 "Reach out to our old allies of the Weltkrieg."
italy_shared.25.e:0 "Italy shall stand alone!"
italy_shared.25.f:0 "The Russians will appreciate our strength properly."

italy_shared.30.t:0 "The Fate of Italian Irredentist Claims?"
italy_shared.30.d:0 "We must decide the policy of our new United Italy. There are still rightful Italian lands that others, such as Austria, claim. Some suggest focusing on just the land in Austria while others think that we should focus on Italian Matters, and not get embroiled in new conflicts."
italy_shared.30.a:0 "An Excellent Idea! Italy must be Whole!"
italy_shared.30.b:0 "We have more pressing issues."

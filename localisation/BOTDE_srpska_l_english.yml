botdepact.1.t.BAN:0 "The King Meets with Elena Bacaloglu"
botdepact.1.d.BAN:0 "With Romanian victory in the Fifth Balkan War, it was silently and immediately agreed upon by both Belgrade and Bucharest should turn to their age-old goal: the liberation of their peoples from Habsburg vices. Continuing the trend of militarization and increasing conscription, merely mustering our own strength will almost certainly not be enough to subdue the Dual Monarchy.\n\nIt will take allies in nearby places; namely, the lost territories of Greater Romania, of which are Banat, Transylvania, and Bukovina. Having invited a reported 'Romanianist' in Banat, Elena Bacaloglu, to Bucharest, an interception by the Camarilla tipped off the unassuming woman to the true nature of the meeting.\n\nConfirmed by Iron Guard members from low and high places, the lady has connections to the Transleithanian city of Fiume and ties to much of the wider Romanian political sphere.\n\nThe meeting quickly turned cordial, with a discussion between her and the King ensuing over politics - and the loyal Camarilla present note her disdain of the Iron Guard. Furthermore, it was discovered how prevalent her 'Indrazneti' organization was - it seems the [AUS.GetEvidenz] was hard at work covering things up. However, she guarantees more can be done to liberate Romania with direct involvement from Bucharest, even alluding to the possibility that her band of militias could seize control over the region with enough support."
botdepact.1.a:0 "A true lady of Romania. Promise more efforts at once."

botdepact.1.t.BUK:0 "The King Meets with Nichifor Robu"
botdepact.1.d.BUK:0 "Known in Moldavia for his incursions to recruit, the militant Nichifor Robu has a long history in the land of Bukovina. His recent activities have been monitored by Codreanu, however; it is now known that he has a devoutly anti-Iron Guard sentiment. Reportedly, the man is even more radical than some of the most in the Iron Guard. The final straw was when he assassinated an adjutant to Codreanu himself with a concealed revolver, fleeing the scene along with many concealed Lancieri thugs.\n\nAll these transgressions coat the rug of the royal palace in spikes as the King and Robu make their way through it for an urgent meeting - the destruction of Austria and liberation of Robu's native Bukovina. Robu asserts that his forces, emboldened by conflict with both the Iron Guard and the Habsburg garrisons, would be able to incite uprising with popular support given enough by the King and the loyal Camarilla. Despite being underpopulated and underfunded, Robu has managed to scrape together enough material to pose a genuine threat to Austrian forces.\n\nWith such contacts being made throughout the Banat, Transylvania, and Bukovina, Austria's reemergement onto the world stage is inevitable - and Robu has urged the king to strike soon and quickly before the Austrians can tie their ramshackle, jury-rigged empire together into a cohesive federation."
botdepact.1.b:0 "Hopefully such volatile men can be kept in line."

botdepact.1.t.TRS:0 "The Captain Meets with Ion Mota"
botdepact.1.d.TRS:0 "With the Great Game nearing its final acts, the Captain has decided to take daring steps into Transylvania. Absolutely flooded with K.u.K. military police, both Romanian-populated and Serbian-populated regions remain the greatest hotbeds of nationalist resistance. Scouts and inside men have directed the Captain to a familiar Ion Mota, chairman of the Fratille de Cruce, a Christian paramilitary organization nearly entirely modeled on his Iron Guard. On some wooded hills, the chairmen were surrounded by men of both of their bands - and Mota pledged to assist Codreanu's ambitions both in Transylvania and at home - if he can use his vast influence to bolster his organization.\n\nAs the FdC is under tight supervision, especially from the omniscient Hungarian rangers, Mota confesses his organization is not what it once was. Such a statement obviously alludes to the South Slavic Revolts, when detachments of the FdC fought on the behalf of Serbian Chetniks in Serb Bosnia. Many of these grizzled veterans have found themselves in high positions in the FdC, urging Mota to make more attacks on Austria before they are all wiped out - each passing day Austria gathers more loose bearings and heals its many ailments more and more.\n\nCodreanu listened intently and the two found much common ground - and this meeting will hopefully be the starting embers of a Sixth Balkan War - one which results in a victory for all oppressed peoples."
botdepact.1.c:0 "Greater Romania shall rise, by whatever means necessary."

botdepact.1.t.SKS:0 "[SER.GetLeader] Reties Old Ribbons"
botdepact.1.d.SKS:0 "While it is no secret that Serbia had at least some involvement in the South Slavic Revolts, it was not by the closely-guarded goverment, staffed by K.u.K. and Bulgar hogs; but by disgruntled veteran officers and soldiers of Serbia who illegally crossed the border to assist in the war. Once more, the Serb military has a grand opportunity to once more cast its lot into destroying Austria from the inside. A veteran Chetnik, Dobroslav Jevđević, was noted for leading Chetniks at a young age in his native Bosnia. The opportunist has made overtures to have himself represent a unified Serb Bosnia, which has for the most part been accepted.\n\nJevđević, a common thorn in the sides for Austrian ambition, quickly left the meeting, fearing [AUS.GetEvidenz] agents spying on the meeting, but it seems they were none the wiser. As a gesture of goodwill, a first delivery of supplies have been made to the resistance - and more is soon to follow. With our help we may once again stir the keg for conditions even more ripe than the South Slavic Revolts, and bring the Austrian dominion to a crashing defeat."
botdepact.1.e:0 "God is with Serbia, now and forevermore!"

botdepact.2.t:0 "Domination Across the Tisza"
botdepact.2.d:0 "Budapest has fallen! Our armies have smashed through the Carpathians and thundered down from the Pannonian Basin and through Bukovina to take what is righteously Romanian. It seems the Habsburg tradition of losing has never been lost; and our capture of Budapest has only solidified the point. While a military garrison is set up in the city and the last pockets of military and civilian resistance exterminated, it is necessary to decide on the future of a Romanian Balkans.\n\nSome of the most radical opinions obviously support the full annexation of all Transylvanian territories, but these radicals also call for the full integration of the land on the eastern bank of the Tisza River.\n\nThis would be difficult to demand in a peace conference, but if our progress continues unheeded, this will not be a problem.\n\nIt is to be noted, though, how zealous Hungarian resistance might remain for decades, if not for an eternity, in the region. The problem will already be bad in the Szeklerland, but it will have a malice of ten magnitudes in the Hungarian region across the Tisza. Do we add it to our plans for Greater Romania or no?"
botdepact.2.a:0 "All lands east of the Tisza are Romanian!"
botdepact.2.b:0 "It's not worth the effort."

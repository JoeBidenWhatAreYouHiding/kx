rhodesia.1.t:0 "Rhodesia"
rhodesia.1.d:0 "Do you want to play as Rhodesia?"
rhodesia.1.a:0 "Keep playing as South Africa"
rhodesia.1.b:0 "Play as Rhodesia"

rhodesia.2.t:0 "The Economy Crashes"
rhodesia.2.d:0 "Urgent news has just reached Salisbury this morning of the economic disaster that has begun to envelope the globe! 'Black Monday' as it is currently being called has seen our once prosperous economy plummeting in a fiery nosedive towards the red. The ruling bigwigs in the United Federal Party have lept to action to try and stop the financial hemorrhaging that has affected our markets since the start of the 'Black Week.' Whether their desperate attempts at austerity and economic triage remains to be seen, as the hardy and stoic Rhodesians once again steele themselves in the face of hardship."
rhodesia.2.a:0 "Stay Calm, and keep a stiff upper lip."

rhodesia.4.t:0 "The Economic Crisis is Over"
rhodesia.4.d:0 "After what has felt like an eternity, it seems the initial economic freefall that occurred as a result of the dreaded 'Black Monday' has been nearly entirely reversed, and our brave colony marches onwards to a more prosperous future. Under the stewardship of the UFP, we have saved our people and their ways of life. However, we did not escape our near-immolation without being left with the scars and marks common in such an engagement, and it will be some years before our slice of the Dark Continent is fully healed and our economy is recovered. The financial collapse has also revealed cracks in the facade of the UFP's seemingly unstoppable popularity, and it seems an actual challenge from the Labour Party for the soul of the nation is not as fanciful as it once seemed."
rhodesia.4.a:0 "Rhodesians once more have braved the harshest of trials."

rhodesia.5.t:0 "Snap Elections"
rhodesia.5.d:0 "With the horrors of "Black Monday'' still fresh in the minds of each and every countryman across our lands, many have been calling for a change in direction. Though the United Federal Party saved our colony from the brink, it was also responsible for getting us so close to that ledge in the first place. With this in mind, a call for snap elections has been growing throughout the colony and today, the powers at be have finally given their answer. The UFP, along with the rest of our parliament, have announced that new snap elections will be held in order to reorganize the direction of our fair state. The chief rival to the UFP is the Rhodesian Labour Party, but many still believe the UFP's dominance to be insurmountable. Now the choice lies within the hands of our esteemed electorate..."
rhodesia.5.a:0 "The UFP Holds on!"
rhodesia.5.b:0 "Labour Sweeps Parliment!"

rhodesia.6.t:0 "Possible Reformation of the Land Apportionment Act"
rhodesia.6.d:0 "Since our colony's foundation, a heated point of conflict between white immigrants and the natives has been the issue of land rights and ownership in the colony. With the past acceptance of the Land Apportionment act, no Native African in the colony could purchase land outside of predetermined ‘Native Purchase Areas,’ or NAP’s, essentially creating native reservations while white settlers are free to purchase land nearly anywhere. With the recent effects of Black Monday still being felt, some feel it may be time to reform this act, one way or another. On one hand, many MP’s believe the act to be far too restrictive to both our cultural and economic growth and that natives must be allowed to purchase some lands off the NAP’s, or at least have the NAP’s be enlarged as overpopulation has become a rampant issue in these zones. On the other hand, some MP’s believe the act to not be restrictive enough, blaming the native landowners for most of the troubles Black Monday caused or exposed. Regardless, this bill has greatly inflamed debate within our parliament and a decision on its passage will take countless hours of arguing and compromise. Eventually, the parliament door opened and an announcement was made; the final result was…"
rhodesia.6.a:0 "The Land Act undergoes ‘friendly’ reforms."
rhodesia.6.b:0 "The Land Act is further strengthened and harshened."

rhodesia.7.t:0 "Union Proposed with South Rhodesia"
rhodesia.7.d:0 "Though nominally under the control of His Imperial and Royal Majesty Kaiser Wilhelm II, the day to day operations of our fair colony are still micromanaged by an Anglo-majority administration. Though we operate and cooperate with the rest of our sister-colonies in the German monstrosity known as Mittelafrika, our hearts still lie past the White Cliffs of Dover. As such, we still maintain a remarkably close and cordial relationship with our Anglo-Saxon cousins in South Rhodesia, which stands as one of the last free holdouts of Anglo-Africa. Despite the geo-political borders separating our citizens, the interactions and connections between us still bind us together and are as strong as ever. To alleviate this egregious separation, many in our parliament have called for a plebiscite to be held on the issue of Rhodesian unification. They argue that the South Rhodesians are closer to us than any Hun or Krout, and such a move would only be natural. In response to this, the nay-sayers of such a plebiscite fear reprisal from the Kaiser and his forces for such open talks of what could be considered treason. We must walk a delicate line here going forward."
rhodesia.7.a:0 "We should not anger our gracious overlords, shut down the proposal."
rhodesia.7.b:0 "Damn the Kaiser, send the proposal to our southern brothers."

rhodesia.8.t:0 "They Say Yes"
rhodesia.8.d:0 "Huzzah! Our brethren to the North have accepted our plea for unification, and we march together towards a better future. Tonight, we shall celebrate and be merry as we revel with our new fellow countrymen, for tomorrow we must begin the long and arduous process of merging two separate nations into one."
rhodesia.8.a:0 "Tally-ho! Onwards together for a united Rhodesia!"

rhodesia.9.t:0 "They Say No"
rhodesia.9.d:0 "Damn them! Our so-called “brothers” in North Rhodesia have had the gall to decline our generous offer of unification and, with their declination, the dreams of a united Rhodesia have been dashed. We must continue to live under the Kaiser’s heel, separated from our people and our fellow Anglos. We now know how truly lonely the Dark Continent can be."
rhodesia.9.a:0 "The southern fools have declined our calls for national unity."

rhodesia.10.t:0 "Zambia’s Destiny Lies with the Anglo"
rhodesia.10.d:0 "The vile Huns couldn’t keep us from our destiny! We true inheritors and tamers of this Dark Continent have finally and fully wrestled control of our fair colony out of the Kaiser’s greedy hands and with that, Rhodesia is ours. We shall begin work at once to formally create the Rhodesian Federation and build up the necessary systems fitting of our new found statehood. No longer will we live and toil on the whims of a foreign king, for now we are free to live and work this land as we please. Rhodesia forever!"
rhodesia.10.a:0 "Oh Rhodesia, May she be worthy of the name."

rhodesia.11.t:0 "Internal Labour Elections"
rhodesia.11.d:0 "With the world situation changing more with every waking minute, a political reorganization is in store for our fair colony and many within the various parties of Rhodesia clamour for change. First of the two major parties to commence their internal elections is the Labour Party, with a heated race expected to follow for who will be the face of the party. Of the myriad of possible candidates for party leader stand three factions whose prominence and political clout far out measure their compatriots. The frontrunners of this trio are none other than Garfield Todd. This titan of the Labour party is the favorite to win and is expected to tow the party line, but whispers have been heard of a possible upset victory from Labour Party dark-horse Doris May Taylor, a radical from the Socialist Wing. Who will stand triumphant out of these three men, no one knows for certain; what is certain is that whoever is chosen will shape the Labour Party for years to come."
rhodesia.11.a:0 "The Social Democratic Faction Wins."
rhodesia.11.b:0 "The Social Liberal Faction Wins."
rhodesia.11.c:0 "In an upset, Radical Socialists take hold of the Party."

rhodesia.12.t:0 "Internal UFP Elections"
rhodesia.12.d:0 "As our fierce rivals in the Labour Party finish their internal elections, the great United Federal Party too shall undergo internal reorganization. The election of a new party head is never an easy or quick task, but its effects are felt for generations. Similar to the Labour Party’s three-wing divide, our UFP too has three main wings that are vying for control. The two most prominent of these factions is the Social Conservative Wing, led by Winston Field, and the Social Liberal Wing which is headed by Godfrey Huggins. As these two factions go for each other's throats in the debates, Desmond Lardner Burke and his Rhodesian Front have stalked the conference like a hunting lion, gathering support from under the noses of his opponents. As the final day of the party convention ends, who will be chosen to be the new face of the United Federal Party?"
rhodesia.12.a:0 "The Social Conservative Faction Wins."
rhodesia.12.b:0 "The Social Liberal Faction Wins."
rhodesia.12.c:0 "MPs Loyal to the Rhodesian Front manage to take hold of the Party!"

rhodesia.14.t:0 "Direction of the Labour Party"
rhodesia.14.d:0 "With the surprise success of more 'far-left' representatives in the recent internal elections for the Labour Party, more and more Labour ministers have begun to question the parties current ban on 'socialist' parties. Allowing these reds into our party could shore up our support and eventually grant us even more seats in Parliament, but would also greatly anger our enemies in the United Federal Party, as well as those still fearful of the red revolutions of the 1920’s. Regardless of the possible positives and negatives, the debate rages on. The final call will be announced shortly, and the future of the Labour Party hangs in the balance."
rhodesia.14.a:0 "What Harm could it do?"
rhodesia.14.b:0 "Not a Chance."

rhodesia.15.t:0 "Vote of No Confidence"
rhodesia.15.d:0 "With the parties now done with their internal elections and the economic crisis behind us, the future of North Rhodesia will be decided! Brave ministers from our parliament have called for a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Burke, seeking to oust this "old fool" and replace him with a younger and more zealous face: proposed leader of the Rhodesian Front, Ian Smith. Though this measure has been seen as overly drastic by some MP's, enough felt it was at least worth debating and so the vote was called. Our colony's future hangs in the balance and a path must be chosen. Whoever is chosen will either lead us to glory, or doom us all to die on this unforgiving contient. Now all we can do is count the votes."
rhodesia.15.a:0 "We Need a Fresh Face, Choose Smith!"
rhodesia.15.b:0 "Burke has proved himself a capable leader."

rhodesia.16.t:0 "Securing the Government"
rhodesia.16.d:0 "Chaos and calamity have seized the Dark Continent, and the people of Rhodesia now watch in terror as the maelstrom of disorder and bloodshed spreads across the former lands of Mittelafrika. Even here, in our relatively stable oasis of order here on the banks of the Zambezi, the cracks have begun to show as this situation further deteriorates into madness. \n\n To secure the Rhodesian government and our last remaining shreds of law and order, many within our cabinet have suggested a return to full military rule for the time being, until a more stable and less-life threatening time returns. The main figure these militarists have called for to rule Rhodesia in this hour of need has been Sir Arthur Harris, honored Marshal of the Rhodesian Air Force. Ever an honorable and talented man, Harris has served in Rhodesia since before the Weltkrieg and has built a respectable and revered military career here in Africa. With this keen-eyed veteran at the helm, Rhodesia would likely weather this brewing storm caused by Mittelafrika’s collapse, but such a drastic cessation of the normal democratic process would likely anger many. We walk a delicate line now, and Rhodeisa’s future hangs in the balance."
rhodesia.16.a:0 "Appoint Harris to stabilize Rhodesia!"
rhodesia.16.b:0 "We don't need to take any drastic measures."

Only 81 Native Purchase Areas were allocated very close to Native areas. Over 51 per cent of the land or 19,890,398 hectares of land was assigned as White area, whilst 29.7 per cent was given to indigenous people. It should be noted that during this period there were only about 50, 000 white settlers as opposed to 1,081,000 indigenous people. Most of these white settlers were acquiring this land for speculative purposes. Africans were relegated to very infertile areas, whilst their white counterparts were given fertile land at very cheap rates or no payment at all."

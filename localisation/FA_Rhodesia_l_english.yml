### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_GLESSING_DESC:0 "Born in St. Petersburg, Russia Gottfried Lessing was a boy when he participated in the Bolshevik revolution. After it's defeat in the Russian Intervention Lessing moved to Germany where he attempted to spread the ideology of Lenin and incite a workers revolt. Chased out of Germany in 1935 by angry police officers, Lessing sought refuge in the Union of Britain, witch denied him entry on account of his support for Bolshevik groups within the UoB. Chased by the German police, Lessing fled Europe and began a journey that eventually lead him to the jungles of Rhodesia where he attempted to set up a Marxist-Leninist Society among the native population in a remote village."
POLITICS_DORISLESSING_DESC:0 "Doris was born in Kermanshah, Iran, on 22 October 1919, to Captain Alfred Tayler and Emily Maude Tayler, both British subjects. Her father, who had lost a leg during his service in World War I, met his future wife, a nurse, at the Royal Free Hospital in London where he was recovering from his amputation. The couple would leave Britain after the revolution and go to Iran, for Alfred to take a job as a clerk for the Imperial Bank of Persia. In 1925, the family moved to the British colony of Southern Rhodesia. As a girl Doris was educated first at the Dominican Convent High School, a Roman Catholic convent all-girls school in the Southern Rhodesian capital of Salisbury. She left school at age 13 and was self-educated from then on. She left home at 15 and worked as a nursemaid. She started reading material that her employer gave her on politics and sociology and began writing around this time. In 1937, Doris moved to London in the Union of Britain to pursue her writing career and socialist beliefs. She only just returned to her home of Rhodesia after it was liberated by the proletariat and its chains were broken."
POLITICS_GARFIELD_DESC:0 "Todd was born in Invercargill, New Zealand, in 1908. Todd emigrated to Southern Rhodesia from New Zealand in 1934 as a Protestant missionary and ran the Dadaya New Zealand Churches of Christ Mission school. Todd plans to introduce modest reforms aimed at improving the education of the black majority by taking tax-money paid by Rhodesian property owners and appropriations from the British colonial authorities, and directing it toward black schools. He has also devised a plan to give elementary education to every African of school age. Todd previously pushed a bill through the Legislative Assembly that would allow for multiracial trade unions in order to undercut the growing white nationalist influence in the unions."
POLITICS_HUGGINS_DESC:0 "Huggins was born in Bexley in north Kent, England on the 6th of July, 1883. After practising medicine and training as a surgeon in London, Huggins travelled to Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia in 1911 to act as a locum to some doctors there. He would return  to the UK in late 1914 following the outbreak of war and joined the Royal Army Medical Corps with the rank of Captain, stationed at Colchester Hospital which had become a casualty clearing station. Although he wanted to go to France he was sent to Malta where he dealt with incoming casualties from the Battle of Gallipoli. He returned to Southern Rhodesia at the end of the war and bought Craig Farm on the outskirts of Salisbury. He began again as a surgeon, quickly becoming the best known in Rhodesia. Though he was on the side of union with South Africa when there was a referendum on the matter, he has since accepted the Rhodesian decision to 'go it alone.'"
POLITICS_BOMBER_DESC:0 "Harris was born on 13 April 1892, at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, where his parents were staying while his father George Travers Harris was on home leave from the Indian Civil Service. With his father in India most of the time, Harris grew up without a sense of solid roots and belonging. Harris was educated at Allhallows School in Devon. A former Allhallows student, the actor Arthur Chudleigh often visited the school and gave the boys free tickets to his shows. Harris received such a ticket in 1909, and went to see the play during his summer holidays. The lead character in the show was a Rhodesian farmer who returned to England to wed, but ultimately fell out with his pompous fiancée and married the more practical housemaid instead. The idea of a country where one was judged on ability rather than class was very inspiring to the adventurous Harris, who promptly told his father that he intended to emigrate to Southern Rhodesia instead of going back to Allhallows for the new term and would arrive in Rhodesia in 1910. When the First World War broke out in August 1914, Harris did not learn of it for nearly a month, being out in the bush at the time. Despite his previous reluctance to follow the path his father had had in mind for him in the army, and his desire to set up his own ranch in Rhodesia, Harris felt patriotically compelled to join the war effort. In October 1915, after unsuccessfully attempting to find a position in first the cavalry, then the Royal Artillery, Harris joined the Royal Flying Corps and would learn to fly later that year. Harris remained in the newly formed Royal Air Force following the end of the First World War, but would return to Rhodesia after the defeat of the government by the syndicalist forces."
POLITICS_FIELD_DESC:0 "Winston Field was born on 13 April 1892, in Bromsgrove in Worcestershire, England. He would move to Southern Rhodesia in the 20's and become a tobacco farmer. After the fall of Britain to Syndicalisim, he became a committed anti-syndicalist and a powerful voice in the British-dominated areas of the Federation, namely Rhodesia. Now he has been elected to lead Rhodesia through her first of many challenges, unto the bright and early dawn."
POLITICS_BADEN_DESC:0 "Baden-Powell was born as Robert Stephenson Smyth Powell at 6 Stanhope Street, Paddington in London, on 22 February 1857. After having been educated at Charterhouse School in Surrey, Baden-Powell served in the British Army from 1876 until 1910 in India and Africa. In 1899, during the Second Boer War in South Africa, Baden-Powell successfully defended the town in the Siege of Mafeking. During the final year Weltkreig Powell was appointed supreme commander of British Africa in order to boost failing British Morale. After the war's end he was offered a role in both the Canadian and South African militaries witch he turned down in favor of retirement in German occupied Rhodesia from where he coordinated with many nations in order to promulgate the Boy Scouts program. Powell Despises Syndicalisits for destroying his beloved Empire, and has been called to lead a free, British Rhodesia in this hour of need. With the hero of the Matabele war on their side Rhodesians are ready to reclaim lost glory."
POLITICS_BURKE_DESC:0 "There is something almost tragic about the life of Desmond Lardner-Burke, it's probably why he's such an intractable individual today. Born in the Cape of Good Hope in 1909, young Burke aspired to be a lawyer but fate wouldn't have it that way. Burke was only a young boy when word returned home that many of his brothers were slaughtered by the German Imperial Forces in East Africa, this set off a chain reaction that would come to define Burke for the rest of his life. When the empire collapsed in 1925, the legacy of Cecil Rhodes died with it, this fact coincided with the death of his brothers by German hands, fueled a furious anger inside Burke, one that would never cease. Burke became active in politics soon after and helped form a grand coalition of Pro-British and Far-Right factions dubbed the "Rhodesian Front", which would rise in popularity during the 20s and early 30s. Burke would be the face of this movement, becoming known as a young radical in a sea of old politicians, he would use this popularity to get several of his ideological points to the masses and subsequently entrench them in the Rhodesian Front. After allying with the United Federal Party and seizing power after the 1937 Constitutional election, Burke now resides over a nation as shattered and broken as he once was, but Burke will rebuild Rhodesia into his image and stand up to the Hunnic Menace, by any means necessary."

rhodesia.1.d:0 "Do you want to play as Rhodesia?"
rhodesia.1.a:0 "Keep playing as South Africa"
rhodesia.1.b:0 "Play as Rhodesia"

rhodesia.2.t:0 "The Economy Crashes"
rhodesia.2.d:0 "Urgent news has just reached Salisbury this morning of the economic disaster that has begun to envelope the globe! 'Black Monday' as it is currently being called has seen our once prosperous economy plummeting in a fiery nosedive towards the red. The ruling bigwigs in the United Federal Party have lept to action to try and stop the financial hemorrhaging that has affected our markets since the start of the 'Black Week.' Whether their desperate attempts at austerity and economic triage remains to be seen, as the hardy and stoic Rhodesians once again steele themselves in the face of hardship."
rhodesia.2.a:0 "Stay Calm, and keep a stiff upper lip."

rhodesia.4.t:0 "The Economic Crisis is Over"
rhodesia.4.d:0 "After what has felt like an eternity, it seems the initial economic freefall that occurred as a result of the dreaded 'Black Monday' has been nearly entirely reversed, and our brave colony marches onwards to a more prosperous future. Under the stewardship of the UFP, we have saved our people and their ways of life. However, we did not escape our near-immolation without being left with the scars and marks common in such an engagement, and it will be some years before our slice of the Dark Continent is fully healed and our economy is recovered. The financial collapse has also revealed cracks in the facade of the UFP's seemingly unstoppable popularity, and it seems an actual challenge from the Labour Party for the soul of the nation is not as fanciful as it once seemed."
rhodesia.4.a:0 "Rhodesians once more have braved the harshest of trials."

rhodesia.5.t:0 "Snap Elections"
rhodesia.5.d:0 "With the horrors of "Black Monday'' still fresh in the minds of each and every countryman across our lands, many have been calling for a change in direction. Though the United Federal Party saved our colony from the brink, it was also responsible for getting us so close to that ledge in the first place. With this in mind, a call for snap elections has been growing throughout the colony and today, the powers at be have finally given their answer. The UFP, along with the rest of our parliament, have announced that new snap elections will be held in order to reorganize the direction of our fair state. The chief rival to the UFP is the Rhodesian Labour Party, but many still believe the UFP's dominance to be insurmountable. Now the choice lies within the hands of our esteemed electorate..."
rhodesia.5.a:0 "The UFP Holds on!"
rhodesia.5.b:0 "Labour Sweeps Parliment!"

rhodesia.6.t:0 "Possible Reformation of the Land Apportionment Act"
rhodesia.6.d:0 "Since our colony's foundation, a heated point of conflict between white immigrants and the natives has been the issue of land rights and ownership in the colony. With the past acceptance of the Land Apportionment act, no Native African in the colony could purchase land outside of predetermined ‘Native Purchase Areas,’ or NAP’s, essentially creating native reservations while white settlers are free to purchase land nearly anywhere. With the recent effects of Black Monday still being felt, some feel it may be time to reform this act, one way or another. On one hand, many MP’s believe the act to be far too restrictive to both our cultural and economic growth and that natives must be allowed to purchase some lands off the NAP’s, or at least have the NAP’s be enlarged as overpopulation has become a rampant issue in these zones. On the other hand, some MP’s believe the act to not be restrictive enough, blaming the native landowners for most of the troubles Black Monday caused or exposed. Regardless, this bill has greatly inflamed debate within our parliament and a decision on its passage will take countless hours of arguing and compromise. Eventually, the parliament door opened and an announcement was made; the final result was…"
rhodesia.6.a:0 "The Land Act undergoes ‘friendly’ reforms."
rhodesia.6.b:0 "The Land Act is further strengthened and harshened."

rhodesia.7.t:0 "Union Proposed with South Rhodesia"
rhodesia.7.d:0 "Though nominally under the control of His Imperial and Royal Majesty Kaiser Wilhelm II, the day to day operations of our fair colony are still micromanaged by an Anglo-majority administration. Though we operate and cooperate with the rest of our sister-colonies in the German monstrosity known as Mittelafrika, our hearts still lie past the White Cliffs of Dover. As such, we still maintain a remarkably close and cordial relationship with our Anglo-Saxon cousins in South Rhodesia, which stands as one of the last free holdouts of Anglo-Africa. Despite the geo-political borders separating our citizens, the interactions and connections between us still bind us together and are as strong as ever. To alleviate this egregious separation, many in our parliament have called for a plebiscite to be held on the issue of Rhodesian unification. They argue that the South Rhodesians are closer to us than any Hun or Krout, and such a move would only be natural. In response to this, the nay-sayers of such a plebiscite fear reprisal from the Kaiser and his forces for such open talks of what could be considered treason. We must walk a delicate line here going forward."
rhodesia.7.a:0 "We should not anger our gracious overlords, shut down the proposal."
rhodesia.7.b:0 "Damn the Kaiser, send the proposal to our southern brothers."

rhodesia.8.t:0 "They Say Yes"
rhodesia.8.d:0 "Huzzah! Our brethren to the North have accepted our plea for unification, and we march together towards a better future. Tonight, we shall celebrate and be merry as we revel with our new fellow countrymen, for tomorrow we must begin the long and arduous process of merging two separate nations into one."
rhodesia.8.a:0 "Tally-ho! Onwards together for a united Rhodesia!"

rhodesia.9.t:0 "They Say No"
rhodesia.9.d:0 "Damn them! Our so-called “brothers” in North Rhodesia have had the gall to decline our generous offer of unification and, with their declination, the dreams of a united Rhodesia have been dashed. We must continue to live under the Kaiser’s heel, separated from our people and our fellow Anglos. We now know how truly lonely the Dark Continent can be."
rhodesia.9.a:0 "The southern fools have declined our calls for national unity."

rhodesia.10.t:0 "Zambia’s Destiny Lies with the Anglo"
rhodesia.10.d:0 "The vile Huns couldn’t keep us from our destiny! We true inheritors and tamers of this Dark Continent have finally and fully wrestled control of our fair colony out of the Kaiser’s greedy hands and with that, Rhodesia is ours. We shall begin work at once to formally create the Rhodesian Federation and build up the necessary systems fitting of our new found statehood. No longer will we live and toil on the whims of a foreign king, for now we are free to live and work this land as we please. Rhodesia forever!"
rhodesia.10.a:0 "Oh Rhodesia, May she be worthy of the name."

rhodesia.11.t:0 "Internal Labour Elections"
rhodesia.11.d:0 "With the world situation changing more with every waking minute, a political reorganization is in store for our fair colony and many within the various parties of Rhodesia clamour for change. First of the two major parties to commence their internal elections is the Labour Party, with a heated race expected to follow for who will be the face of the party. Of the myriad of possible candidates for party leader stand three factions whose prominence and political clout far out measure their compatriots. The frontrunners of this trio are none other than Garfield Todd. This titan of the Labour party is the favorite to win and is expected to tow the party line, but whispers have been heard of a possible upset victory from Labour Party dark-horse Doris May Taylor, a radical from the Socialist Wing. Who will stand triumphant out of these three men, no one knows for certain; what is certain is that whoever is chosen will shape the Labour Party for years to come."
rhodesia.11.a:0 "The Social Democratic Faction Wins."
rhodesia.11.b:0 "The Social Liberal Faction Wins."
rhodesia.11.c:0 "In an upset, Radical Socialists take hold of the Party."

rhodesia.12.t:0 "Internal UFP Elections"
rhodesia.12.d:0 "As our fierce rivals in the Labour Party finish their internal elections, the great United Federal Party too shall undergo internal reorganization. The election of a new party head is never an easy or quick task, but its effects are felt for generations. Similar to the Labour Party’s three-wing divide, our UFP too has three main wings that are vying for control. The two most prominent of these factions is the Social Conservative Wing, led by Winston Field, and the Social Liberal Wing which is headed by Godfrey Huggins. As these two factions go for each other's throats in the debates, Desmond Lardner Burke and his Rhodesian Front have stalked the conference like a hunting lion, gathering support from under the noses of his opponents. As the final day of the party convention ends, who will be chosen to be the new face of the United Federal Party?"
rhodesia.12.a:0 "The Social Conservative Faction Wins."
rhodesia.12.b:0 "The Social Liberal Faction Wins."
rhodesia.12.c:0 "MPs Loyal to the Rhodesian Front manage to take hold of the Party!"

rhodesia.14.t:0 "Direction of the Labour Party"
rhodesia.14.d:0 "With the surprise success of more 'far-left' representatives in the recent internal elections for the Labour Party, more and more Labour ministers have begun to question the parties current ban on 'socialist' parties. Allowing these reds into our party could shore up our support and eventually grant us even more seats in Parliament, but would also greatly anger our enemies in the United Federal Party, as well as those still fearful of the red revolutions of the 1920’s. Regardless of the possible positives and negatives, the debate rages on. The final call will be announced shortly, and the future of the Labour Party hangs in the balance."
rhodesia.14.a:0 "What Harm could it do?"
rhodesia.14.b:0 "Not a Chance."

rhodesia.15.t:0 "Vote of No Confidence"
rhodesia.15.d:0 "With the parties now done with their internal elections and the economic crisis behind us, the future of North Rhodesia will be decided! Brave ministers from our parliament have called for a vote of no confidence against Prime Minister Burke, seeking to oust this "old fool" and replace him with a younger and more zealous face: proposed leader of the Rhodesian Front, Ian Smith. Though this measure has been seen as overly drastic by some MP's, enough felt it was at least worth debating and so the vote was called. Our colony's future hangs in the balance and a path must be chosen. Whoever is chosen will either lead us to glory, or doom us all to die on this unforgiving contient. Now all we can do is count the votes."
rhodesia.15.a:0 "We Need a Fresh Face, Choose Smith!"
rhodesia.15.b:0 "Burke has proved himself a capable leader."

rhodesia.16.t:0 "Securing the Government"
rhodesia.16.d:0 "Chaos and calamity have seized the Dark Continent, and the people of Rhodesia now watch in terror as the maelstrom of disorder and bloodshed spreads across the former lands of Mittelafrika. Even here, in our relatively stable oasis of order here on the banks of the Zambezi, the cracks have begun to show as this situation further deteriorates into madness. \n\n To secure the Rhodesian government and our last remaining shreds of law and order, many within our cabinet have suggested a return to full military rule for the time being, until a more stable and less-life threatening time returns. The main figure these militarists have called for to rule Rhodesia in this hour of need has been Sir Arthur Harris, honored Marshal of the Rhodesian Air Force. Ever an honorable and talented man, Harris has served in Rhodesia since before the Weltkrieg and has built a respectable and revered military career here in Africa. With this keen-eyed veteran at the helm, Rhodesia would likely weather this brewing storm caused by Mittelafrika’s collapse, but such a drastic cessation of the normal democratic process would likely anger many. We walk a delicate line now, and Rhodeisa’s future hangs in the balance."
rhodesia.16.a:0 "Appoint Harris to stabilize Rhodesia!"
rhodesia.16.b:0 "We don't need to take any drastic measures."

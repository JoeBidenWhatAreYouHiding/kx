### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MANUEL_BISBE_DESC:0 "Among the founders of the Cuban Authentic Party, Manuel Bisbé Alberni and other more moderate members left the organisation shortly before the bloodbath of 1935, and like many other ex-Authentics, joined with the Unionistas. Rumours circulated during the Havana Strike that Bisbé was directly involved with some moderate dissident groups, and while such speculation was never confirmed, Bisbé's appointment to boss of the Unionista Party following Rafael Trejo's retirement was almost certainly motivated his favourability among the dissatisfied."
POLITICS_MARIO_GARCIA_MENOCAL_DESC:0 "President from 1913 to 1921, many Cubans look back on Menocal's time in office with great fondness. Before the scandals of Zayas and the tyranny of Machado, the man remains one of Cuba's most respected heads of state. Following the revolution of 1928 and worried with the nation's political direction, Menocal re-entered politics and was elected to the Cuban senate. There, he and his new National Democratic Association allied with the remnants of the old Liberal Party to oppose, at least ostensibly, the military and Unionistas alike."
POLITICS_RAMON_GRAU_MARTIN_DESC:0 "As a professor at the University of Havana's medical school, Grau with other dissidents within the faculty and student body to resist the rule of Gerardo Machado. While Grau was not directly involved in organizing the mass student protests which catalyzed the revolution of 1928, he and his supporters quickly emerged as a powerful political force in the chaotic time immediately thereafter. A staunch nationalist, he was far from satisfied with the post-revolutionary status quo and while he initially supported the Unionistas in their power struggle against the military, his ever-increasing disdain for the socialist-bloc, and desire to limit the influence of the United States, led to his utilizing extra-legal means to achieve his goals. Grau came to head a prominent paramilitary group, 'The Greenshirts', and while he still espouses democratic ideals, his rhetoric, like his position, has become decidely thuggish.\nAmidst the chaos following the election of 1935, Grau, now operating from the countryside where government rule had all but collapsed, hardened into the man he is today; both an idealist and a tyrant, steadfast yet so quick to compromise his beliefs, Ramón Grau San Martín is a walking contradiction."
POLITICS_LAZARO_PENA_DESC:0 "The young Lazaro Peña succeeded Sandalio Junco as boss of the CNOC totally inexperienced. Peña's meteoric rise in the short time since caught many among even Cuba's left off guard. An advocate of complete collectivisation and industrial development, Peña wears the moribund label of 'communist' with pride. Despite this, the CNOC and its leadership both past and present, have both embraced many aspects of European syndicalism and paradoxically call for cultivation of a stronger Cuban national identity in an internationalist context."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_GUITERAS_DESC:0 "As leader of the Cuban Socialist Party following the Cuban revolution of 1928, Guiteras was a thorn in the side of Cuba's military kingmakers and instrumental in the survival of the party and socialism in general in Cuba following the events of 1935. Now, as chairman of the broad 'Socialist Movement', successor to the old party, and President of Cuba, Guiteras will undoubtedly be equally involved in shaping the future of the nation. While Guiteras is a relatively orthodox syndicalist, he possesses his own unique ideological quirks which could be crucial to the nation's ultimate fortune."
POLITICS_JUAN_HERNANDEZ_DESC:0 "Often compared to Nicaragua's Sandino, Juan Blas Hernández waged a years-long guerilla war in Cuba's southern hills. He is first and foremost a man of the people, and more than willing to fight and bleed for the sake of the nation's least fortunate. Now in power, President Hernández seeks not only to live up to his grandiose rhetoric, but the larger-than-life reputation he has garnered among many in the Cuban peasantry."
POLITICS_RAFAEL_TREJO_DESC:0 "As a young law student at the University of Havana, Rafael Trejo González grew increasingly disillusioned with the authoritarian regime of Gerardo Machado Morales. He joined the newly founded anti-Machado 'University Student Directory', established along the lines of the defunct 'University Student Federation', as well as the equally disaffected 'Law Students Association'. By late 1927 he had become influential in the former and the President of the latter. Trejo's impassioned yet collected denunciations of Machado and his influence within the university as well as his close association with Socialist disciples of exiled former student leader, Julio Mella McPartland, led to his forced dismissal following pressure from Machado's government. In response, Trejo led demonstrations in Havana and with the support of elements of the Cuban Army, overthrew Machado. Thereafter, Trejo, with the support of the military under the presumption that he would be easily controlled on account of his age, was appointed President instead of his older colleagues within the new caretaker government. Despite becoming President of Cuba just after his 18th Birthday and amidst rising tensions between his more extreme coalition partners, Trejo effectively guided the nation through the tumultuous years that followed his revolution."
POLITICS_MIGUEL_GOMEZ_DESC:0 "The son of Cuba's second president, José Gómez, Miguel Gómez was first elected to national public office during the Machado era. While he begrudgingly followed the Liberal Party line and lent Machado his support, he was among the most vocal supporters within the legislature of the student demonstrations that toppled the Machado regime. Following the success of the student revolution and the collapse of the Liberal Party, Gómez founded the Republican Party along with other moderate members within the defunct Liberal Party's right-wing. Opposed to undue regulation, Gómez envisions a Cuba enriched by a flourishing financial sector and booming trade with the wider world."
POLITICS_CARLOS_MENDIETA_DESC:0 "Senate President Mendieta succeeded Clemente Vazquez as President of Cuba following the latter's assassination, and Vazquez's shoes have proven hard to fill. Regardless, Mendieta, though calls for reform abound, even from within his own party, attempts to maintain the character of the executive established under his authoritarian predecessor."
POLITICS_JOSE_BARNET_DESC:0 "Following a long and illustrious career as a diplomat, Jose Agrapino Barnet was appointed as President by an outgoing Carlos Mendieta. While many assumed his Presidency would be a fleeting 'lame duck', Barnet approaches his position with a degree of professionalism rarely seen in Cuba's cutthroat political atmosphere."
POLITICS_MARTIN_TAMAYO_DESC:0 "As a junior officer stationed near the Cuban Presidential Palace, Martin Diaz first came to prominence at the head of a contingent of soldiers who joined with the student revolution of 1928. Finding himself at the forefront of a rapidly coalescing faction within the military and granted the rank of General, the merely thirty year old Diaz soon became the most powerful individual in Cuba, even more influential in the nation's politics than the President himself. Now, years later as President in his own right, Diaz stands nearly unopposed as the luminous sun around which Cuban politics orbit."
POLITICS_FUGLENCIO_BATISTA_DESC:0 "The chaos of the Havana strike led to Colonel Fulgencio Batista taking control of the chaotic Cuban nation. Now the most powerful individual in Cuba, Batista has set out on policies that will enrich Cuba by any means, including selling out his country to foreign vices and organized crime syndicates. This may not be poplar with many, however Batista’s grip in Cuba is too tight to have that matter. However, despite Batista’s iron grip, nearly the entire political establishment (including leftists) support president Batista. At least for now. "
POLITICS_CLEMENTE_VAZQUEZ_DESC:0 "Clemente Vazquez was among president Machado's closest confidants and the President of the Senate for most of Machado's tenure, and despite many close calls, survived multiple attempts of his life following Machado's downfall. Unlike so many of old Liberal party, Vazquez held fast to the authoritarian model for the presidency established by Machado. Thanks to American brokerage of several informal deals with General Batista, Vazquez returned to Cuban politics after only a short stint laying-low in the American embassy, and quickly found his feet. As President, Vazquez continues to emulate his older mentor, and many Cubans find his rule to be nearly indistinguishable from that of Machado."
POLITICS_JULIO_MELLA_DESC:0 "Grandson of Dominican hero, Matías Mella, Julio Mella had his first run in with the law as a first year university student during the tenure of president Zayas. As President of the ideologically socialist University Students Federation, Mella attempted to resist the authoritarian regime of Gerado Machado. For this, he was exiled to Mexico for the next eleven years. Upon his return, Mella quickly re-established his position within the Cuban left and brought with him a new ideology known as 'transformationism' influenced by Mexican agrarian socialist strains of thought. As President, Mella seeks to turn Cuba into a model for 'transformationism' for the world, no matter the cost or who may attempt to stand in his way."
POLITICS_CARLOS_CESPEDES_DESC:0 "Carlos de Céspedes, son of the Cuban independence hero of the same name, spent decades in politics and the Cuban diplomatic service. While ostensibly loyal to Machado during that pivotal tyrant's tenure, Céspedes secretly worked to undermine his regime, coordinating closely with other disaffected Liberal party members. Soon after the student revolution, Céspedes returned to elected office with a stint in the Senate, wherein he founded the New Liberal Party to unite like-minded former Liberals who with the dissolution of the Liberal Party lacked any formal association. As president, Céspedes looks to return Cuba to the early days of the Zayas regime, without the alleged corruption of course, and with a consciousness for often overlooked social and political realities."
POLITICS_RAUL_ROA_DESC:0 "Grandson of a decorated Mambí, Raúl Roa first developed his revolutionary socialist ideals as a student activist against the regime of Gerado Machado. Upon his release from prison, he worked closely with extralegal socialist opposition groups and the ideologically mixed 'University Student Directory' at the University of Havana. While not a direct participant of the protests which precipitated Machado's ousting, he found a platform writing for various left-wing publications, gain a good degree of celebrity among Cuban socialists. While Roa was only appointed to the office of the Presidency as part of a compromise between Cuba's feuding socialist factions, he possesses a knack for leadership and public speaking beyond his years."
POLITICS_ALBERTO_BAYO_DESC:0 "Expelled from the Cuban Air corps for pistol-dueling another airman, Alberto Bayo joined the Spanish Legion and fought in that nation's colonial war in northern Morocco. Returning to Cuba in 1932 following the dissolution of the short-lived Spanish Republic, Bayo joined with the rebel Juan Blas, training guerillas to fly whatever small aircraft they managed to capture. Eventually, Bayo relationship with Blas grew to the extent that each man became the other's closest confident. With Blas's untimely 'departure' from the struggle, Bayo took up leadership of those who would still pledge their loyalty to the wider movement Blas had led."
POLITICS_SANDALIO_JUNCO_DESC:0 "A close associate of Julio Mella's and exiled along with him to Mexico in 1925, Junco managed to secretly return to Cuba after the Cuban student revolution and eventually rose to the leadership of the CNOC, which still retained the ideological character it had possessed in 1925. Despite working with other socialist groups out of necessity, Junco disagreed deeply with the ideology and personal character of other socialist leader such as Antonio Guiteras and Juan Blas. Eventually forced to step down from his position as chairman of the CNOC by disaffected younger members, Junco retained a large of degree of influence within the organisation and the 'Comunista' faction of the Cuban Socialist Movement. As President, Junco seeks total collectivisation of land and the nation's rapid forced industrial development."
POLITICS_TINA_MODOTTI_DESC:0 "A noted photographer of Italian origin, Tina Modotti came to Mexico in 1922 to follow a Mexican lover. Years later, she met and, out of character with her history of moving from one affair to the next, eventually married Cuban exile, Julio Mella. Upon the Cuban socialist revolution, Modotti returned with her new husband to the island, helping to re-establish his political career from the moment her feet first touched Cuban soil. After climbing through the ranks of her husband's government, Modotti succeeded him upon his death, becoming Cuba's first female head of state. She remains committed to her husband's Transformationist ideology and authoritarian style of governance."

CUB_public_works_desc:0 "Both former President Trejo's work programs and its later revision were effectual in tackling unemployment but are not suited for times of growth. A more permanent program should be implemented to put the unemployed to work on infrastructure."
CUB_priv_pub_joint_ven:0 "Private-Public Ventures"
CUB_priv_pub_joint_ven_desc:0 "While private enterprise is second-to-none in generating profit, and that certainly is beneficial, its profit motive is often at odds with what is best for the nation as a whole. Where necessary, the government must work together with private business to establish independent entities which are liable to both and benefit all."
CUB_inc_subsidies:0 "Targeted Subsidies"
CUB_inc_subsidies_desc:0 "To save the young revolution, the government of Rafael Trejo had to make concessions, often in the form of subsidies, to various organisations. These should be thrown out and the money instead put towards legitimate investment in essential industries."
CUB_intermed_indust:0 "Intermediate Industry"
CUB_intermed_indust_desc:0 "Just as sugar is made from sugar cane before its incorporation into other products, there is a great demand for industrial products to be used in other products, we should exploit this niche and invest in the production of semi-finished goods."
CUB_ind_exports:0 "Industrial Exports"
CUB_ind_exports_desc:0 "While industry is certainly beneficial for our own nation in of itself, the export of industrial goods can also generate income and prosperity and encourage further industrial growth. Let us do whatever necessary to support the export of industrial products."
CUB_new_cuba:0 "New Cuba"
CUB_new_cuba_desc:0 "The worst is over and the political atmosphere is now a great deal more stable. From these recent struggles, a new Cuba has emerged, more able than ever to overcome hardship and imbued with direction and purpose."

CUB_new_economic_expansion:0 "New Economic Expansion"
CUB_new_economic_expansion_desc:0 "With the political situation resolved, economic shortfalls can at last be assessed and remedied. A substantial investment in modernisation and construction should be made to kickstart this process."
CUB_resource_boom:0 "Resource Boom"
CUB_resource_boom_desc:0 "Much of our nation's natural resources remain untapped. We must use all that this wonderful land has to offer us."
CUB_resource_foc_1:0 "Search for Oil"
CUB_resource_foc_1_desc:0 "American business interests discovered several exploitable oil deposits in the north of our nation several years ago. As of yet, however, our nation produces no petroleum of any sort. Let us formally assess the potential of our oil fields and begin to produce from them what we can."
CUB_resource_foc_2:0 "Chromium Wealth"
CUB_resource_foc_2_desc:0 "Cuba has an abundance of Chromium throughout, yet despite our status as one of the largest producers of Chromium, much of our deposits remain unexploited. With state funding, our mines will surely abound with an even greater wealth of this useful resource."
CUB_resource_foc_3:0 "Focused Steel Production"
CUB_resource_foc_3_desc:0 "Steel is the backbone of so many of modern society's technological marvels. Our meagre steel industry, however, is hampered by unpredictable supplies of high-quality iron. By exploiting local iron deposits and investing in the industry, some of its woes may be lessened and steel production increased."
CUB_resource_foc_4:0 "Dreams of Rubber"
CUB_resource_foc_4_desc:0 "A few experiments in rubber cultivation have taken place in our nation. Despite the favorability of the Cuban climate to rubber production, due to a lack of funding, these previous attempts failed. Interest in rubber cultivation has again entered into the political conversation. Should rubber be imported for cultivation?"
CUB_protect_miners:0 "Protect Miners"
CUB_protect_miners_desc:0 "With a mining boom spurred by recent investment in resource exploitation, the plight of those who must actually work in the mines has received a great deal of attention. We should draft legislation protecting the rights of miners."
CUB_further_econ_reform:0 "Further Economic Reform"
CUB_further_econ_reform_desc:0 "[CUB_econreformfocloc]"
CUB_shipping_reform:0 "Bolster Merchant Fleet"
CUB_shipping_reform_desc:0 "As an island nation, all exports and imports must be fulfilled by sea. If our nation is to have sustained economic growth, our merchant marine must be expanded "
CUB_port_expand:0 "Expand Ports"
CUB_port_expand_desc:0 "Outdated and painfully undersized ports have long been an economic bottleneck for our nation. Let us begin the process of renovating and expanding them."
CUB_improve_live_cond:0 "Improve Living Conditions"
CUB_improve_live_cond_desc:0 "Despite their crucial economic role, dockworkers of all stripes have been neglected by previous administrations. The men whose toil is the lifeblood of our nation should be allowed the dignity due to them."
CUB_encour_consumpt:0 "Intellectual Development"
CUB_encour_consumpt_desc:0 "Education is key to national prosperity, and despite the recent prestige of the University of Havana, Cuba remains woefully lacking in places of higher learning. A substantial governmental effort must be made to correct this by building new universities and incentivizing foreign intellectuals to immigrate."
CUB_gem_carib:0 "Gem of The Caribbean"
CUB_gem_carib_desc:0 "Cuba is a nation of natural abundance and with the success of our recent reforms, it has once again become a shining gem in the Caribbean."

CUB_foreign_relate:0 "Foreign Relations"
CUB_foreign_relate_desc:0 "Now that the terrible strife that defined our nation for so dreadfully long is at an end, we can begin to assert ourselves diplomatically."
CUB_fed_relate_trade:0 "The Federation"
CUB_fed_relate_trade_desc:0 "The West Indies Federation Arose from the rapidly collapsing British Empire to consolidate Anglo-French holdings in the region. As our most powerful neighbour, they cannot be ignored, we should extend our political and economic influence there."
CUB_local_relate_trade:0 "Regional Diplomacy"
CUB_local_relate_trade_desc:0 "The nations of the Caribbean share a history of colonial subjugation and foreign domination. We should work to foster closer ties throughout the region."
CUB_american_relate_trade:0 "Relations with America"
CUB_american_relate_trade_desc:0 "Our mighty neighbour to the north has long been both our greatest friend and enemy alike. As the political reality of both our nations evolves, so too must that relationship."
CUB_european_relate_trade:0 "European Opportunities"
CUB_european_relate_trade_desc:0 "Europe is the economic and political heart of the world; we would be foolish to not promote our national economic and diplomatic interest there."
CUB_new_partners:0 "New Trade Partners"
CUB_new_partners_desc:0 "The nations of South America are sure to become increasingly important trade partners. Let us get ahead of the curve and establish closer ties with nations there."
CUB_old_friends:0 "Old Friends"
CUB_old_friends_desc:0 "America has long been our greatest friend, and that relationship has now only been reinforced. Let us formalise our commitment to them and they to us!"
CUB_new_allies:0 "New Allies"
CUB_new_allies_desc:0 "We can longer associate with America, and to avoid both their wrath and otherwise protect our nation's sovereignty, we must find new allies."
CUB_joint_research:0 "Joint Research"
CUB_joint_research_desc:0 "We should link our military research apparatus to that of our allies."
CUB_military_integrate:0 "Military Integration"
CUB_military_integrate_desc:0 "We should push for the military command structure of our alliance to be shared by all its members; the tactics of one ally need not only be coordinated with another, but integrally linked."

CUB_begin_mil_reform:0 "Begin Military Reform"
CUB_begin_mil_reform_desc:0 "Our armed forces are in a dreadful state, and while there may once have been a time when our nation could rely on the United States for its defence, the world has become increasingly turbulent, and we must take steps to bolster our military."
CUB_assess_army:0 "Assess Army"
CUB_assess_army_desc:0 "For years, factionalism plagued the army and rendered it wholly ineffective. With such issues now at an end, the army should be comprehensively assessed and restructured to ensure loyalty."
CUB_infantry_doctrs:0 "Without Me, My Rifle is Useless"
CUB_infantry_doctrs_desc:0 "Men are the beating heart of any army, but even well-armed men without discipline and proper planning become little more than a rabble."
CUB_new_squad_tactics:0 "New Squad Tactics"
CUB_new_squad_tactics_desc:0 "Plans, no matter how well drawn, aren't executed in the drawing room. Each NCO, should be given proper training to ensure they are equipped with a knowledge of modern tactics and their place in the greater strategic picture."
CUB_armament_doctrs:0 "Without My Rifle, I Am Useless"
CUB_armament_doctrs_desc:0 "With military technology advancing more rapidly than ever, maintaining technological parity and integrating new weapons into established formations has become increasingly critical. Therefore, our doctrine must be tailored towards the use of modern armaments."
CUB_weltkrieg_analysis:0 "Weltkrieg Analysis"
CUB_weltkrieg_analysis_desc:0 "The tactical and strategic innovation that occurred during the Weltkrieg has irreversibly redefined how wars are fought. Our army, however, has yet to adapt these breakthroughs. We should commission a review of the war and adapt."
CUB_modernisation:0 "Modernisation"
CUB_modernisation_desc:0 "Much of our equipment is nearly obsolete. Let us retrofit what we can and develop new models of what is unsalvageable."
CUB_entice_foreign_experts:0 "Foreign Advisers"
CUB_entice_foreign_experts_desc:0 "Our allies abroad can provide valuable insights into the theory and prosecution of warfare. We should request advisers from them."
CUB_carib_lake:0 "Caribbean Lake"
CUB_carib_lake_desc:0 "While our valiant army must be prepared to defend our nation to the bitter end, it is of course, preferable that they never reach our shores to begin with. The Caribbean must be at the forefront of our military policy."
CUB_blackbeard:0 "Blackbeard"
CUB_blackbeard_desc:0 "The days when the Caribbean Sea was a hotbed of piracy are long past. Keeping with this storied tradition, however, our fleets can be specialized to the destruction of enemy trade."
CUB_buccaneer:0 "Buccaneers"
CUB_buccaneer_desc:0 "U-Boats are a devastating tool of modern warfare capable of wreaking havoc on enemy vessels without ever even being seen. To truly rekindle the spirit of the buccaneers, we must develop our own U-Boat fleet."
CUB_coast_guard:0 "Integrate the Coast Guard"
CUB_coast_guard_desc:0 "The Marina Nacional, our nation's coast guard, has grown into an effective fighting force, but its administration remains entirely separate from that of the navy. By somewhat merging their general staffs, they can both operate more effectively."
CUB_protect_trade:0 "Protect Trade"
CUB_protect_trade_desc:0 "As an island nation, we will always rely on imports and exports to at least some degree. Assuring that our merchant fleets can sail the seas unmolested should therefore be our navy's mission."
CUB_power_projection:0 "Power Projection"
CUB_power_projection_desc:0 "Our navy must be able to fight beyond the safety of our shores and the Caribbean Sea. With our doctrine established, let us overhaul our naval production and develop the capability to project naval power abroad."
CUB_protect_shores:0 "Protect Our Shores"
CUB_protect_shores_desc:0 "The pristine and low-lying coastline of our nation render us susceptible to invasion. We should construct defensive fortifications all along the coast."
CUB_airforce:0 "Air Corps Expansion"
CUB_airforce_desc:0 "Military aviation played an important role in the Weltkrieg and if our fledgling Air Corps is to be effective, it must have the numbers to effectively contest our enemies. How to conduct this expansion, however, is a matter of debate."
CUB_combinedarms:0 "Combined Arms"
CUB_combinedarms_desc:0 "Wars are ultimately won on the ground. Our Air Corps, therefore, should be closely integrated into the command structure of the army and tailored to the support of ground forces."
CUB_ind_airforce:0 "Independent Air Corps"
CUB_ind_airforce_desc:0 "The Air Corps should be an independent military branch fully capable of making its own tactical and strategic decisions. Doing so will ensure its flexibility and increase its effectiveness."
CUB_found_air_academy:0 "Expand Air Academy"
CUB_found_air_academy_desc:0 "Our nation is home to many prominent civilian aviators. We should consult with them on the planned expansion of the central air academy. With their input, new pilots will be trained more effective."
CUB_escort_fighters:0 "Long-Range Fighters"
CUB_escort_fighters_desc:0 "Larger aircraft, such as bombers, naturally possess a greater range than the fighters that protect them. We must have purpose-built long-range fighters to ensure that our other aircraft are never without support."
CUB_flying_tanks:0 "Flying Tanks"
CUB_flying_tanks_desc:0 "New CAS designs are larger and heavier than their older counterparts and are often aptly described as flying tanks. We would be foolish not to invest in the development of such aircraft."
CUB_airinfrastructure_program:0 "Air Infrastructure"
CUB_airinfrastructure_program_desc:0 "To support our growing Air Corps, we must build new infrastructure for its upkeep and the production of necessary war materials."
CUB_marine_expand:0 "Expand Marine Corp"
CUB_marine_expand_desc:0 "Emulating the United States, our nation established its amphibious forces as an independent military branch. As an island nation and with global conflict an ever-increasing threat, we must bolster our Marine Corp."
CUB_new_landing_craft:0 "New Landing Craft"
CUB_new_landing_craft_desc:0 "New vehicles designed specifically to allow amphibious units to quickly and effectively disembark even under fire have recently been developed. With modern landing craft of our, our Marines will surely be more effective."
CUB_naval_aviation:0 "Naval Aviation"
CUB_naval_aviation_desc:0 "Ships are as vulnerable to aircraft as a pillbox or Panzer. We should develop new naval aircraft designs and rule the seas from the skies."
CUB_skip_bombing:0 "Low-Level Bombing"
CUB_skip_bombing_desc:0 "Though dangerous and requiring a great deal of skill on the part of pilots, by flying at low altitudes in certain engagements and employing clever new bombing techniques such as skip bombing, our naval aircraft can fight much more effectively. We should instruct new naval pilots on the ins and outs of low-level bombing."

CUB_democracy_survives:0 "Resurgent Democracy"
CUB_democracy_survives_desc:0 "While nearly destroyed, democracy has emerged stronger than ever. With the economic situation also improving rapidly, the fundamental pillars of representative government can be reinforced."
CUB_march_institutions:0 "March On The Institutions"
CUB_march_institutions_desc:0 "Extremists abound in even the highest governmental offices, slowly but surely undermining our nation's liberty. We must assess the threat they pose and dismiss problematic individuals as necessary."
CUB_econ_rappro:0 "Economic Rapprochement"
CUB_econ_rappro_desc:0 "Many prominent businesses foreign and domestic threw their lot in with those who sought to destroy our democracy. New comprehensive regulations must be established to minimise subversive behaviour of this sort in the future without stifling future investment. This will undoubtedly be a long process and we should begin as soon as possible."
CUB_milaudit:0 "Permanent Audit"
CUB_milaudit_desc:0 "Military influence is sure to return and again threaten democracy, that is inevitable. By establishing a permanent civilian committee to assess the political influence of the military in the same way a bureaucrat may conduct an audit, perhaps even in such a situation liberty can yet survive such a future situation."
CUB_loosenspeech:0 "Freedom Of The Press"
CUB_loosenspeech_desc:0 "Even immediately following the Student Revolution, the press has never truly been uncensored. With the political situation now sufficiently stable, we should at last allow the press to operate without restriction."
CUB_clean_slate:0 "Clean Slate"
CUB_clean_slate_desc:0 "Democratic government is defined by at least nominal deferment to the constituency. That constituency is still divided by the troubles of the past, and thus many are fearful of both societal and punitive repercussions for their past actions. Let us begin to reconcile with political dissidents of all shades, wiping their slate clean and reintegrating them into general society."
CUB_empowerment:0 "Popular Empowerment"
CUB_empowerment_desc:0 "To redress grievances the average Cuban has few avenues and social norms discourage non-conformity. This has the result of both limiting our national and political potential and pushes disgruntled citizens towards radical political movements. We must work to effect a social transformation, encourage the people to find their voice and listen to them."
CUB_never_again:0 "Never Again"
CUB_never_again_desc:0 "Let not the ghosts of the past continue to haunt our people. While we have made great strides towards proper reconciliation, many still face economic hardship due to prior injustice. We should establish a commission to identify localities which remain guarded towards our government and work to win back their loyalty and trust."
CUB_consitutional_conv:0 "Constitutional Convention"
CUB_consitutional_conv_desc:0 "The constitution of 1928 was borne from bitter compromise and is ultimately more conducive to tyranny than true democracy. Let us call upon the nation's entire political apparatus, working together to create a document suited to liberty."
CUB_mod_reform:0 "Enshrine Gradual Reform"
CUB_mod_reform_desc:0 "The wounds of old are healing and the people are at last afforded the potential for legitimate participation in the political system. However, while radicalism is declining, its insidious promises of sweeping change remain in the hearts of the populace. We must promote in a rather propagandistic fashion the virtue of gradual reform and maintaining the stability of our democracy."
CUB_leg_marti:0 "Legacy Of Martí"
CUB_leg_marti_desc:0 "The nation that Martí dreamed of is finally coming into being. May he smile upon us from Heaven itself."

CUB_authoritarianism_normal:0 "Batista's Cuba"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_desc:0 "General Batista, after years of political struggle against the very same civilian government he helped to establish, has now not only secured power, but cemented his rule and the power of the military. Cuba is firmly in his grasp alone."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_2:0 "Replace The Constitution"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_2_desc:0 "The constitution has been suspended for such an extended period that most have now lost their foolish fondness for the document. The time to replace it is finally at hand."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_3:0 "Limit Foreign Political Influence"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_3_desc:0 "Our friends abroad, while useful, must not be allowed to continue to tighten their hold over our nation's political system. We should sideline their lackeys while remaining otherwise amiable to foreign interests."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_4:0 "A New Union"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_4_desc:0 "While many of the nation's labour groups were forcibly dismissed for their socialist leanings, those that have remained loyal and open to bribery have proven indispensable in maintaining political control. We should create a national labour organisation regulating such entities and ensuring their continued cooperation."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_5:0 "Pragmatic Permitting"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_5_desc:0 "As commerce is the lifeblood of nations, well-ordered commerce is the lifeblood of well-ordered nations. We must be open to economic interests foreign and domestic without fail, but to do such open business, all must also work on behalf of the nation and the regime when called upon or should not be allowed to do business at all."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_6:0 "Changing Of The Guard"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_6_desc:0 "The military has been directly responsible for the suppression of subversive elements. This waste of resources must be ended. A national police force, loyal not just to one municipality, but the central government alone, should be established."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_7:0 "Hail Columbia"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_7_desc:0 "However our neighbour to the North is governed or its policy towards our nation, our regime's survival hinges upon developments there. We must establish a new bureaucratic office dedicated specifically towards understanding America and shaping the narrative there about our fair country to suit our national interest. In case of war, the office can also be tasked with combating America specifically."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_8:0 "A Careful Balance"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_8_desc:0 "A regime such as our shall always be vulnerable by its very nation. The position of various interest groups and their relationship with each other and within the government must constantly be assessed and manipulated accordingly. We must focus on manipulating the very nature of such relationships in our favour."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_9:0 "No Greater Flattery"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_9_desc:0 "The German Emperor, despite obvious failings, is admired by his people and secure in his power. To cultivate a similar image must be the goal of any leader. While it may seem a waste, let us spend lavishly on pomp and ceremony; let the Cuban people look upon their leader as the Germans do theirs."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_10:0 "Ingratiate Afro-Cubans"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_10_desc:0 "The military has been an outlet for Afro-Cuban social and economic mobility even as racism has continued to permeate Cuban society. As such, our regime finds disproportionate support among the Black population. We must further ingratiate Afro-Cubans to our regime and focus on bettering their lot without totally disrupting the established racial hierarchy in our nation."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_11:0 "Tighten Restrictions"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_11_desc:0 "While the army is currently fully under control, the potential for insurrection from within its ranks will always remain. The new and relatively untainted national military police force must be expanded and integrated into its ranks to deal with this."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_12:0 "The Whole World In His Hands"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_12_desc:0 "With foreign interests restrained to our satisfaction, we can now use our ties to these same groups to promote Cuban influence abroad."
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_13:0 "Total Control"
CUB_authoritarianism_normal_13_desc:0 "Society must be tightly ordered at every level, and while there will always be dissent both from our regime and from social norms, we have come far to eliminate such behaviour. Let us look to an even brighter future."

CUB_puppet_begin:0 "The North Star"
CUB_puppet_begin_desc:0 "Like the North Star, whether we like it or not, America guides us both directly and by example. With this in mind, we must now choose our path."
CUB_auth_continue:0 "Preserve The Regime"
CUB_auth_continue_desc:0 "While President Vázquez may be lost to us, the nation that he built shall not be. Let us stand arm in arm with America for our mutual benefit."
CUB_auth_continue_2:0 "Placate Sugar Planters"
CUB_auth_continue_2_desc:0 "Our regime's pursuit of economic development has left many sugar planters, both American and otherwise, incensed. The Americans have begun to lobby for their cause increasingly, and with that, it has become necessary to work towards a mutually acceptable agreement."
CUB_auth_continue_3:0 "Silence Internal Opposition"
CUB_auth_continue_3_desc:0 "Our government is infested with traitors who speak of misguided reform. They must be removed from power and our regime cleansed."
CUB_auth_continue_4:0 "Anti-Syndicalist Bulwark"
CUB_auth_continue_4_desc:0 "Socialism in general and Syndicalism in particular are a dangerous blight, rotting one country and the next at their very core. We must not allow such ideas to ever regain their foothold in Cuba. Through both ideologically charged education and societal repression, we shall do just that."
CUB_auth_continue_5:0 "Cutthroat Politicking"
CUB_auth_continue_5_desc:0 "The intrigue that defines the internal politics of our government would be seen as detrimental by some. The skill set that such behaviour creates in our administrators however is undoubtedly beneficial. Cutthroat politicking must be controlled, wielded even, not stamped out."
CUB_auth_continue_6:0 "American Propaganda"
CUB_auth_continue_6_desc:0 "The propaganda machine of the Americans is second to none. We must begin to make use of it to stoke our own people's nationalistic fervor."
CUB_auth_continue_7:0 "Cement Bureaucratic Control"
CUB_auth_continue_7_desc:0 "With bureaucrats at every administrative level fully controlled, there internal instability would be greatly reduced. Let us do all we can to accomplish such."
CUB_auth_continue_8:0 "Go Forth"
CUB_auth_continue_8_desc:0 "Our relationship with America has been nothing but beneficial; let us bring our nation even further into the American economic sphere."
CUB_democratize_auth:0 "Democratisation"
CUB_democratize_auth_desc:0 "While our regime must remain fundamentally the same, we must also begin to re-open the political sphere and re-introduce democracy; whether Vázquez or Machado, or anyone else, Cuba cannot remain under the thumb of a tyrant."
CUB_democratize_auth_2:0 "Breathing Room"
CUB_democratize_auth_2_desc:0 "The United States has sent inquiry after inquiry as to the intent of our new government. Clearly, they are uneasy. We must convince them of our continued friendship and amiability to American interests."
CUB_democratize_auth_3:0 "Appease American Businesses"
CUB_democratize_auth_3_desc:0 "With the gradual transition to democracy begun, American companies which have flourished under the status-quo have become 'antsy' to say the least. We must meet with prominent American businessmen and assuage their fears while emphasising the necessity of reform."
CUB_democratize_auth_4:0 "Token Prosecution"
CUB_democratize_auth_4_desc:0 "While we do not wish to truly anger supporters of our political rivals, popular demand has increasingly shifted to calls for the prosecution of those most directly involved in the greatest injustices carried out under Vázquez's government. We must give an inch to avoid giving a mile."
CUB_democratize_auth_5:0 "Reconcile Moderates"
CUB_democratize_auth_5_desc:0 "While perhaps the most defining feature of the Vázquez regime was factionalism, united only by President Vázquez's own strength of will, not all hearts have turned to ash. From across the political spectrum, there are those who seek compromise and reconciliation. Let us embrace them with open arms."
CUB_democratize_auth_6:0 "Spring Cleaning"
CUB_democratize_auth_6_desc:0 "The bureaucracy must be free from nepotism at every level. While many have tried and failed throughout history to institute an all-encompassing meritocracy throughout the administration, with our governing principles in mind, our own attempt will certainly see greater success."
CUB_democratize_auth_7:0 "Push A New Document"
CUB_democratize_auth_7_desc:0 "The suspension of our nation's constitution leaves our efforts at reform vulnerable to future repeal. With reinstating that weak document obviously off-the-table, we should draw up a new founding document."
CUB_democratize_auth_8:0 "Revive The Dream"
CUB_democratize_auth_8_desc:0 "The dream of democracy, that which seemed lost with the Socialist takeover and ensuing regime change, is again now a reality. As we look to the future, let us truly rekindle the flame of liberty in the minds of the people."
CUB_nomorelapdop:0 "In Example Only"
CUB_nomorelapdop_desc:0 "Our present regime was born from American ambition. While for our nation's liberation from Socialism we are ever grateful, as the situation evolves to our north, so too must our nation. While we have already begun to move out from the American shadow, let us now stand fully on our own."
CUB_nomorelapdop_2:0 "Fiscal Independence"
CUB_nomorelapdop_2_desc:0 "Foreign banks dominate our nation, and while that isn't an entirely negative state of affairs, foreign financial institutions must be made to partner with domestic companies or through partially domestically owned subsidiaries, before being permitted to fully operate under our nation's favourable legal code. Thus, we will slowly reduce the foreign stranglehold while also not losing their business."
CUB_nomorelapdop_3:0 "Walking The Tightrope"
CUB_nomorelapdop_3_desc:0 "Under the thumb of a foreign power, our nation faced constant regime change and flirted frequently with tyranny. To ensure the stability of our new democracy. Neutral however, will surely prove just as unviable; we cannot sit idle while foreign threats grow out of control. It is paramount that we work to carefully walk the tightrope, allowing some foreign influence while working to limit it when dangerous. As well, we should begin to restock our exhausted reserves of gold."
CUB_nomorelapdop_4:0 "Vanishing Act"
CUB_nomorelapdop_4_desc:0 "Like a magician, we must use smoke and mirrors to confuse our domestic opponents. While we should offer the promise of democracy to even those who oppose our regime, through subtle propaganda and institutional consolidation, the opposition can be relegated fully into history."
CUB_nomorelapdop_5:0 "Complete Media Independence"
CUB_nomorelapdop_5_desc:0 "Fundamentally, the press must be free from government restriction. Not only should we make such a statement reality, but attempt to enshrine freedom of the press so deeply into our governmental fabric that only a radical upheaval could unseat it."
CUB_nomorelapdop_6:0 "Unassailable Institutions"
CUB_nomorelapdop_6_desc:0 "Institutional subversion is a threat to any nation, especially a liberal democracy. We must establish a permanent commission to monitor the bureaucracy."
CUB_nomorelapdop_7:0 "Parliamentary Democracy"
CUB_nomorelapdop_7_desc:0 "The expansive power of the Presidency, while useful in pushing reform, will always be a threat to democracy. We must completely upend the structure of our government, adopting a new constitution reorganising our political system for a strong head of the legislature, assuming most of the role of executive even, and weak Presidency."
CUB_nomorelapdop_8:0 "Real Independence"
CUB_nomorelapdop_8_desc:0 "Martí once dreamt not only of a democratic nation, but one totally free from foreign control - a nation free to forge its own path. May he rest in peace, smiling down upon the Cuba that is emerging."

CUB_orthodox_syndicalism:0 "The Spectre"
CUB_orthodox_syndicalism_desc:0 "As Marx and Engels once proclaimed the spectre of Communism to be haunting Europe, so too now does the spectre of Syndicalism haunt the entire planet. While our revolution has succeeded and been entrenched, our political and economic systems must be further refined, lest we invite the wrath of reactionaries foreign and domestic."
CUB_syndienodem:0 "Subvert The Democratic Process"
CUB_syndienodem_desc:0 "While democracy has its place, the will of the people must be tightly controlled for socialism to truly flourish."
CUB_nodem_tot:0 "Disenfranchise Subversives"
CUB_nodem_tot_desc:0 "The bourgeoisie and their lapdogs deserve nothing but the scorn of the working class. While there are those who dare call themselves socialists that would suggest our new institutions alone will prove sufficient to ensure and end to class tyranny, in truth, subversive elements, including many within the apparatus of the party, must not be at liberty to undermine our nation."
CUB_nodem_tot_2:0 "Embrace European Totalism"
CUB_nodem_tot_2_desc:0 "While we have thus far clung to terminology like simply 'socialist' and even the antiquated 'communist' for lack of more appropriate nomenclature, a bold new idea has emerged from Europe: Totalism. The party should embrace this ideology and its adherents abroad."
CUB_nodem_tot_3:0 "The Hills Are Alive"
CUB_nodem_tot_3_desc:0 "The southern hills have long been a redoubt for guerillas and dissidents of all types. Many of these elusive militants are loyal to the Revolucionarios of Juan Blas Hernández and to avoid inevitable conflict and disorder, we must work to eliminate them immediately."
CUB_nodem_tot_4:0 "Permanent Revolution"
CUB_nodem_tot_4_desc:0 "The revolution has ended, but its spirit must live on! The urgency of revolution is the spring in our people's step, the extra strike of a hammer, the more diligent soldier. This ethos cannot be allowed to wither in times of peace. We must encourage an unceasing revolutionary spirit."
CUB_nodem_tot_5:0 "The Final Conflict"
CUB_nodem_tot_5_desc:0 "At last, Cuba is becoming a truly revolutionary nation, a land of totalism. There still remain those, however, who corrupt our nation from within the party, those who oppose this progress. They can at last be done away with and a new nation truly built."
CUB_nodem_syn:0 "Bureaucratic Dominance"
CUB_nodem_syn_desc:0 "With the failure of the all socialist congress and President Guiteras's consolidation of power, our nation's socialist transformation has been directed largely through executive offices with congress acting as but a rubber stamp on executive actions. This new bureaucracy has become increasingly unwieldy and ineffective. To promote loyalty and efficiency alike, it must further centralised."
CUB_nodem_syn_2:0 "Controlled Integration"
CUB_nodem_syn_2_desc:0 "While the trade unions were allowed to maintain their independence and given a large role in local political and economic management, they have increasingly come into conflict with the bureaucracy. This discord must be solved and to accomplish such, unions must be required to elect to positions of leadership only those who also hold positions within the central bureaucratic apparatus."
CUB_nodem_syn_3:0 "Placate Idealists"
CUB_nodem_syn_3_desc:0 "The means to which our government came to be are certainly not optimal, and in spite of our successes, many within the party believe that the political sphere should be somewhat opened in line with the system present in some other syndicalist nations. While their ideas are flawed, we cannot afford to do away with those of this opinion. We must allocate political resources to assuaging their fears."
CUB_nodem_syn_4:0 "Let Each Stand In His Place"
CUB_nodem_syn_4_desc:0 "For our nation to function and syndicalism to thrive, each individual must be an immutable part of a greater whole. All must be firmly encouraged to do their part to the fullest."
CUB_nodem_syn_5:0 "Administrative Syndicalism"
CUB_nodem_syn_5_desc:0 "Pejoratively, many Orthodox Syndicalists abroad have begun to refer to our regime as one of 'Administrative Syndicalism', where he very core of syndicalism itself has been rotted out by the apparatus of the state. While obviously such slander is rubbish, the 'administrative' aspect is one we can embrace, let us look to a future where all aspects of life have been subsumed by a responsible syndicalist bureaucracy."
CUB_nodem_syntot:0 "Unremittent Presidency"
CUB_nodem_syntot_desc:0 "With weak leadership, our nation's socialism would be likely to collapse under renewed imperialist pressure. While our current president has not led us astray, undoubtedly, another could fill the position much less effectively. The President must be given great legal power to direct who their successor shall be and how limits on executive power should be interpreted."
CUB_syndiedem:0 "Cement Democracy"
CUB_syndiedem_desc:0 "Syndicalism is at its core a democratic ideology. While many syndicalist nations have seen democratic institutions sidelined by the state, we shall be different. Syndicalist democracy shall live on and flourish in Cuba."
CUB_electoral_reform:0 "Communal Electoral Reform"
CUB_electoral_reform_desc:0 "Regional political divisions are still based upon the arbitrary lines drawn by the reactionary regimes of old. We must create new regional and intermediary divisions between the unions and the central government based upon bonds of shared labor rather than simple geography."
CUB_rural_participation:0 "Rural Political Participation"
CUB_rural_participation_desc:0 "In the most rural areas of our nation, many people lack not only a true class consciousness, but also fail to participate in union and local elections, and even fewer join political organisations. We should begin a campaign in such areas of constituent education and fight against apathy."
CUB_syndflav_1:0 "Advance The Fairer Sex"
CUB_syndflav_1_desc:0 "Many even within the Socialist Party may feel that women are purely domestic creatures, but it has always been the party's platform to encourage their political and psychological emancipation. We must begin to allow women not only to fully participate in all democratic functions, but actively promote their participation."
CUB_syndflav_2:0 "Ensure Civility"
CUB_syndflav_2_desc:0 "The syndicalist system, through promotion and integration of trade unions which, despite our best efforts, are often at least partially at odds with each other, has exacerbated certain political disputes to the point of petty violence. We must promote and normalise civility in public debate and politic even if such an effort proves costly."
CUB_syndflav_3:0 "Vigilant Electorate"
CUB_syndflav_3_desc:0 "A syndicalist state, empowered to execute the will of people, is liable to exercise its authority counter to the democratic process. If true syndicalism is be maintained, the people must be instilled with the spirit of democratic vigilance, accepting no overreach on the part of the state."
CUB_syndflav_4:0 "Union Oversight"
CUB_syndflav_4_desc:0 "Within the trade unions, individuals often become entrenched in leadership positions. Regardless of whether these comrades do their jobs effectively, such a state of affairs can lead to subversion of the democratic structures within each union and thus affect the state as a whole. A committee to assess the individual state of all of our nation's unions is need to curtail the issue."
CUB_syndflav_5:0 "Inspiration Abroad"
CUB_syndflav_5_desc:0 "While some formerly socialist nations have strayed into tyranny, others have begun to truly cultivate prosperous and communally minded societies through a variety of mechanisms. We must always look for inspiration abroad and adapt our ideological leanings to reality rather than the folly of the opposite."
CUB_syndflav_6:0 "There Is Power In A Union"
CUB_syndflav_6_desc:0 "Our people, once apprehensive at the imposition of a radical new socioeconomic system, have begun not only to become content with syndicalism, but see its merits. Such attitudes should be encouraged, let us empower the people's minds!"

CUB_revdem_begin:0 "Revolutionary Democracy"
CUB_revdem_begin_desc:0 "The Socialist Party has been proven a farce rife with tyrants as bad as the bastards they sought to overthrow. General Blas's apprehension about ever even joining the foul thing has been proven right. Let us work to establish a new party free from despots, and with it true democracy where the people are placed above all else."
CUB_revdem_newparty:0 "Unionista Rapprochement"
CUB_revdem_newparty_desc:0 "While held hostage by the military and puppets of the United States, the Unionistas always strove to achieve a fair and free Cuba. Indeed, some within the party secretly supported the strike that led to their deposition. Let us make peace with them and allow their formal political participation once again."
CUB_revdem_2:0 "Control The Militias"
CUB_revdem_2_desc:0 "The militias, both for their mixed loyalties and ideological fanaticism have become something of a liability both to our government and the nation as a whole. We must, however, respect the service and character of the men within their ranks, and thus must do whatever possible to assure their loyalty and control their political influence rather than something more drastic."
CUB_revdem_3:0 "Voice Of The Voiceless"
CUB_revdem_3_desc:0 "While many from across the political spectrum would ignore the impoverished or downtrodden, or even grandstand upon their broken backs, in Cuba, that shall not be. We must endeavour to institutionalise the pursuit of economic justice and the spirit of political pragmatism. Let not ideology or ambition muddy this bold vision."
CUB_revdem_4:0 "Root Out Lackeys"
CUB_revdem_4_desc:0 "While Mella has long been defeated, those who sympathise with his authoritarian vision and that of other would-be tyrants still feature prominently in certain circles. Let us do everything we can to divorce such people of any political or even societal influence."
CUB_revdem_5:0 "Renewed Agrarian Reform"
CUB_revdem_5_desc:0 "The reforms undertaken by Blas and the then Revolucionario wing of the Socialist Party have been effective at reducing the gap between rich and poor without causing dangerous economic disruption or fundamentally changing our nation's more agrarian character. We must go further, let us double down on our economic policy."
CUB_revdem_6:0 "Fully Reopen Political Sphere"
CUB_revdem_6_desc:0 "Though the Unionistas and most left-of-centre political organisations have been re-legalised in full, much of the nation's old reformers still remain at least nominally outlawed. Let us re-open the political sphere fully, allowing even liberals to participate in politics so long as they obey our new egalitarian principles."
CUB_revdem_7:0 "Democratic Mindset"
CUB_revdem_7_desc:0 "To truly transform Cuba, the people must be educated both in their duties as citizens and more traditional academic pursuits. Our mediocre albeit not unsalvageable academic systems must be completely updated no matter the cost."
CUB_revdem_8:0 "A Guarded People"
CUB_revdem_8_desc:0 "Among our supporters’ number many whose love of the new nation has become fanatical. Such patriotic fervor, even for democracy and freedom, could become problematic, but it can also be harnessed. Among our soldiers, let us stoke this new feeling of patriotism."
CUB_revdem_9:0 "Deep Wounds"
CUB_revdem_9_desc:0 "After so much political turmoil, revolution upon revolution, coup upon coup, and great economic change, our society is deeply divided. Even amongst those who support our government, many are simply exhausted on a deeper level. We should create a committee to deal with the injustices of the past, providing compensation to past victims of state violence and working to restore our people's spirit as much as physical well-being."
CUB_revdem_10:0 "Bristling Liberty"
CUB_revdem_10_desc:0 "Our nation and its people have embraced liberty as never before. Not the 'liberty' of Locke, or the alternatives offered by Marx or by Syndicalism, a liberty truly of the people, bristling defencively at the potential for its exploitation."

CUB_mella_begin:0 "One Man's Vision"
CUB_mella_begin_desc:0 "Mella has seen the prosperity of the Mexican system and returned to Cuba with nothing but a dream and an ideology. Now he leads the people into the future."
CUB_mella_2:0 "Double Down"
CUB_mella_2_desc:0 "Mella has experience backing his words, Transformationism will lead our economy and the foolish industrialists shall see the error of their ways. For who needs smokestacks when you can have rolling fields of green?"
CUB_mella_3:0 "The Old Way"
CUB_mella_3_desc:0 "Perhaps the Syndicalists have some insight to offer. Moderate industrialisation can't hurt to try, after all, we'll need tractors!"
CUB_mella_4:0 "Eliminate Syndicalist Thought"
CUB_mella_4_desc:0 "From day one, the Syndicalists have impeded our government at every step. We will put an end to these petty politics, and the Communists will do what is just."
CUB_mella_5:0 "Centralised Workers' Councils"
CUB_mella_5_desc:0 "Our nation is wide, and communication is necessary in a modern economy and government. We will establish a congress in Havana to facilitate communication and cooperation among the provinces."
CUB_mella_6:0 "Kangaroo Courts"
CUB_mella_6_desc:0 "The courts have never served the common man. We will ensure this corrupt institution is dragged into the new era."
CUB_mella_7:0 "Racial Harmony"
CUB_mella_7_desc:0 "Over 900,000 Africans were brought to cuba throughout the colonial period, and since the abolition of slavery in 1886, our black comrades have received only contempt. They have been denied equal rights and opportunities. Mella stood before congress today and declared that the state shall actively fight racial discrimination, especially in the workplace. While there is sure to be resistance, no cause is more noble."
CUB_mella_8:0 "Awaken The Fairer Sex"
CUB_mella_8_desc:0 "One of the pillars of social revolution is the abolition of sexism. Women need equal opportunity if we are to ensure total prosperity."
CUB_mella_9:0 "Strength Of Will"
CUB_mella_9_desc:0 "Since his return from exile, Mella has left a great impression on the nation and its people. He has secured his place in Cuban politics and transformed our nation from a backwards, oppressive regime to a worker's paradise. Because of his striking good looks and imposing figure, many citizens now refer to Mella as 'El Caballo'. Who doesn't love the dashingly handsome chairman?"
CUB_mella_10:0 "Fan The Flames"
CUB_mella_10_desc:0 "Cuba is but a stepping stone in the world revolution. We shall act as a base in the Caribbean to liberate the citizens of nearby autocracies. We have nothing to lose but our chains!"
CUB_mella_11:0 "New Cultural Campaign"
CUB_mella_11_desc:0 "Catholicism is rooted in Cuban society, some still need convincing of the backwardness of established religion. This will be a costly campaign, but no revolution can be easy."
CUB_mella_12:0 "Education Reform"
CUB_mella_12_desc:0 "Mella began as a student in Havana, experiencing first hand the abuse suffered. The future is in the hand of the youth, and with decent, state-funded education, they will lead Cuba to glory."
CUB_mella_13:0 "Arisen Out Of Ruins"
CUB_mella_13_desc:0 "Mella has led us through turbulent times. From the overthrow of the oligarchic democracy to the restructuring of our society and rebuilding of the economy. Cuba now enters a brave new world, but with El Caballo no road is too rough."
CUB_melraddeal_2:0 "Shake On It"
CUB_melraddeal_2_desc:0 "Though Mella coerced Comrade Blas into an undeserved coalition government and thus implemented his prefered policies, with the situation now stabilised, Revolucionario pushback and disagreement with the continued suspension of democracy is reaching critical mass. Blas and Mella have agreed to meet to develop a unified policy platform and ensure continued stability."
CUB_melraddeal_3:0 "Till The Fields"
CUB_melraddeal_3_desc:0 "The Revolucionario government has become increasingly skeptical of its Comunista allies' more radical policy options. How Transformationism as an ideology and Cuba's grand experiment in agrarianism is to evolve will largely depend on the compromise struck between Blas and Mella themselves."
CUB_melraddeal_4:0 "Kick In The Pants"
CUB_melraddeal_4_desc:0 "Our system has further politicized middling positions in the economic bureaucracy. Mella and Blas possess two slightly different visions for how the issue should be addressed."
CUB_melraddeal_5:0 "Milletmen"
CUB_melraddeal_5_desc:0 "In a play-on-words, the English speaking world now refers to our agrarian militiamen as 'milletmen'. With the direction of our central leadership, let us show the world these men are even tougher than that hearty grain."
CUB_melraddeal_6:0 "A New Role"
CUB_melraddeal_6_desc:0 "While Mella and Blas disagree strongly on the finer points of women's liberation, both men agree that the chains of tradition must be dissolved. 'Sisters, comrades!' they say, 'you shall be equal.'"
CUB_melraddeal_7:0 "Arise You Damned"
CUB_melraddeal_7_desc:0 "While some accuse the Trabajadores of harbouring some racially chauvanistic sentiments, the anti-racist pedigree of both Blas and Mella is strong."
CUB_melraddeal_8:0 "The Stuff Of Legend"
CUB_melraddeal_8_desc:0 "Foreign armaments are often superior, we should bring in negotiators who have catalyzed the stockpiling for arms amongst the different political factions as formal agents of the state."
CUB_melraddeal_9:0 "Counter-Crusade"
CUB_melraddeal_9_desc:0 "While Blas is firmly against many of the more extreme aspects of Mella's next round of cultural reforms and campaigns, he is amiable towards his anti-clerical ideas. What was once a campaign of cultural transformation shall now become a targeted battle against organized religion and the lingering political and societal influence of the Catholic Church in particular."
CUB_melraddeal_10:0 "A Not-So Paltry Task"
CUB_melraddeal_10_desc:0 "The struggle between the Comunistas and Revolucionarios has deepened and parallel political institutions are forming, which while dangerous, could also be allowed to go forward and indeed integrated into the party apparatus. A centralised government and a decentralised socialist party, we are sure to benefit!"
CUB_melraddeal_11:0 "Bipolarity"
CUB_melraddeal_11_desc:0 "Between two poles, the Cuban political system has tired of constant deadlock and bickering. We must work to get the gears at the base of this great machine of government turning again."
CUB_melraddeal_12:0 "Something's Gotta Give"
CUB_melraddeal_12_desc:0 "While compromise at first seemed possible, the status quo is only becoming increasingly unstable. Something has got to give."

CUB_autenticfoc_begin:0 "One Nation"
CUB_autenticfoc_begin_desc:0 "The crisis is over, but the nation has not yet recovered its spirit and politics have yet to settle down. It is our duty to restore the Cuban people to their rightful place of dignity."
CUB_autenticfoc_2:0 "Control The Greenshirts"
CUB_autenticfoc_2_desc:0 "The Greenshirts are still an important political institution, but some among have grown overzealous to the point of sedition. Such voices must be summarily silenced immediately."
CUB_autenticfoc_3:0 "A Fragile Peace"
CUB_autenticfoc_3_desc:0 "The military must be put to task to suppress remaining insurrectionist elements throughout the country and especially within the apparatus of state. While this will hinder its training and combat readiness process, it is undoubtedly necessary."
CUB_autenticfoc_4:0 "Reinvigorate Democracy"
CUB_autenticfoc_4_desc:0 "The Authentic movement has always been a democratic one, despite its willingness to engage in extra-legal action. While we would be wise to keep up pressure on the opposition, the national emergency should be lifted and political life should resume."
CUB_autenticfoc_5:0 "A Life of Luxury"
CUB_autenticfoc_5_desc:0 "Agricultural exports face greater competition with each passing year; the prosperity of the sector is sure to dwindle without intervention. Rather than reorient the country, we should focus on adding value domestically, and rather than enter a crowded market, we should get ahead of trends in consumption and focus on luxuries. Cuban sugar should be refined in Cuba and Cuban fruits canned in Cuba."
CUB_autenticfoc_6:0 "Speak On Old Promises"
CUB_autenticfoc_6_desc:0 "While much progress in electrification was made under the Unionistas, Grau has promised grander reform. The infrastructural program is to be expanded with the goal of full electrification of laggard provinces and a reduction in energy prices through modernization. With power supplied, another kicker has also been added - home radios for the impoverished so that they may never miss a speech."
CUB_autenticfoc_7:0 "Universal Liberty"
CUB_autenticfoc_7_desc:0 "So that the next generation may develop a proper national consciousness, women must be granted political equality with men, mere suffrage as accomplished in 1921 is not enough. A commission should be established to assess ways to improve women's economic standing."
CUB_autenticfoc_8:0 "Auténtico Education Campaign"
CUB_autenticfoc_8_desc:0 "Among the peasantry and lower middle class that form the basis of our supporters, many are illiterate. Surely it was for lack of education alone that many of the poor were formerly deceived by socialism. To doctor Grau, a professor himself, there is no greater shame. Let us invest in an education system both accessible to all and morally upright."
CUB_autenticfoc_9:0 "Universal Healthcare"
CUB_autenticfoc_9_desc:0 "Hospitals have sprung up around Cuban cities, and while the insurance plans many have recently begun offering have made healthcare accessible to some, to the majority, proper healthcare remains a dream. We have devised a plan to amalgamate the various insurance subsidiaries into an organ of the state, all citizens will be charged a flat rate and lost wages shall be replaced by the state."
CUB_autenticfoc_10:0 "Assimilate Afro-Cubans"
CUB_autenticfoc_10_desc:0 "While liberal Cubans look down their noses at us as little more than a band of despotic street thugs, among much of the Afro-Cuban population we are seen for what we truly are: liberators. Racial discrimination prevents our fair nation from developing a national consciousness worthy of it. Let out nation arise as one and do away with such divisions."
CUB_autenticfoc_11:0 "Bureaucratic Competence"
CUB_autenticfoc_11_desc:0 "Merit alone must guide administrators. Should any bureaucrat infringe upon this sacred truth, he must be dealt with harshly."
CUB_autenticfoc_12:0 "Unwavering Progress"
CUB_autenticfoc_12_desc:0 "A nation marches ever forward. With each new challenge, each new idea which tears the old order asunder, we must adapt. For time is but the great march to the inevitable fulfilment of our ideals. A people that are made to feel similarly assured of success will better fulfil such a destiny."

CUB_econreformfocloc_soc:0 "The emerging revolutionary economy requires institutions specifically tailored to its maintenance.

CUB_econreformfocloc_succ:0 "The corruption of our national institutions under Machado has left a legacy of incompetence.

CUB_econreformfocloc_lib:0 "To properly regulate the national economy, the rabble cannot be trusted. Learned men, men of culture and propriety must be at the forefront of our nation's bureaucracy.

CUB_econreformfocloc_mil:0 "To properly regulate the national economy, the rabble cannot be trusted.

CUB_econreformfocloc_nat:0 "Never has the bureaucracy that wields so much power over our people truly worked to better the country. From the old Liberal Party to Trejo and his lot, those who hand out petty rules are governed only by self-interest. The bureaucracy, now that the economy is no longer in jeopardy, must be thrown out and completely remade. The nation and the people must be its first and only priority."

# Election & Strike
cuba.0.t:0 "Cuba: A Brief History"
cuba.0.d:0 "Cuba, having gained independence only in 1902, is a young nation. While many in the United States seem almost certain that the island will one day become another US State, Cubans hold their national identity close to their hearts. Throughout its first twenty-five years of self-rule, Cuba was plagued by political turmoil caused by American meddling in its internal affairs. On the twentieth of September, 1928, however, Cuban anger towards increasingly dictatorial president, Gerardo Machado, and his American puppet-masters seemed to boil over. By morning the next day, Cuba had a new government comprised of moderates, nationalists, and socialists alike and renewed hope for the future. Even when the leadership of this fleeting caretaker government was forced to appoint the experienced diplomat Jose Agrapino Barnet as President, Cubans remained cautiously optimistic. This was not to last.\nThe new regime, while resentful towards the United States, was forced to make concessions to the America-backed Army to maintain power and nominal authority as it struggled to reign in the effects of the Great Depression. By 1935, the coalition of revolutionaries which had toppled Machado was on the verge of collapse, and on election day, tensions between supporters of the Auténtic and Socialist parties boiled over. In the aftermath of that infamous day when the streets of Havana ran red, the socialists and Auténticos alike were expelled from congress and the moderates of the Republican party in the governing coalition then found themselves the only true opposition to the Army's influence, with what remained of the 'old-guard', supporters of the Liberal party and its more conservative allies, more concerned with securing power than preserving Cuban democracy. New elections for both the congress and the office of the Presidency are scheduled for the twenty-eighth of January, 1936, and as that date looms, so too, seemingly, does the fate of Cuba."
cuba.0.a:0 "Interesting."

cuba.1.t:0 "Special General Election"
cuba.1.d:0 "With the fall of Machado, the Cuban political landscape shifted dramatically. Machado's Liberal party, to which the majority of Cuba's Presidents belonged, and which was undoubtedly the most powerful political entity in the country, collapsed. Shortly before the ill-fated 1935 election cycle, the two largest successors to the Liberal Party, the Republican and New Liberal parties, entered into a coalition with the so-called 'Democratic Movement' of conservative ex-president, Mario García Menocal. Together, this coalition represents a legitimate challenge to the Unionist party of Rafael Trejo which has been steadily gaining support. However, this coalition is fragile and on the verge of breaking. The American-backed military, which has grown increasingly influential in the nation's political scene, has endorsed the former Liberal party Senate President, Clemente Vázquez Bello, as its Presidential candidate, and many Cubans worry that the military may attempt to intimidate voters or otherwise extra-legally skew the results of election. Vázquez's relationship with the Military is in of itself complex, as despite the Military's ties to the United States, it does strive to maintain total political independence, whereas Vázquez would seemingly be content to become little more than an American puppet. Necessity does indeed make strange bedfellows. Also, while many support the Auténticos or Socialists, those organisations have been declared illegal and thus are barred from participating in the election."
cuba.1.a:0 "Trejo is elected."
cuba.1.b:0 "the Coalition remains."
cuba.1.c:0 "Vázquez, the army's man."

cuba.2.t:0 "The New Cabinet"
cuba.2.d:0 "In a gesture of goodwill, following the Student Revolution, then President Barnet offered key cabinet positions to members of the Liberal Party. This practice was continued after the last election. Should this new tradition be upheld or should our highest ministers be drawn only from our own party?"
cuba.2.a:0 "Unity cabinet."
cuba.2.b:0 "Mixed cabinet."
cuba.2.c:0 "American selected cabinet."

cuba.3.t:0 "Double-Dip Recession"
cuba.3.d:0 "The Cuban people still reel from the Great Depression, which never truly came to an end, despite the limited success of President Barnet's economic policies. Now, the collapse of the German economy has reverberated throughout the world. Our nation has not been spared, and we are rapidly entering a period of renewed economic decline. Many Cubans speak openly about the radical proposals of the Socialists and Auténticos and doubt the ability of our government to deal with the crisis."
cuba.3.a:0 "Dear God..."

cuba.4.t:0 "Havana General Strike"
cuba.4.d:0 "In an attempt to capitalise on the turmoil brought on by renewed economic hardship, the Socialist Movement, officially outlawed following last year's election bloodbath, have emerged seemingly stronger than ever to stage protests throughout the city of Havana accompanied by a general strike. The strike has paralyzed most of the city's major industries and sent the civilian government into panic. While so far Socialist activity has been limited to Havana proper, it appears to be growing rapidly. If left unchecked, the strike and general chaos could very well consume the entire nation. The military, headed by General Batista, have been hesitant to act, and without their support, suppressing the strike will undoubtedly prove difficult. Fortunately, however, some opposition figures have expressed their willingness to end the strike in exchange for certain concessions from the government. For now, we can only wait and prepare to put an end to the strike one way or another."
cuba.4.a:0 "Horrid!"

cuba.5.t:0 "Dealing with The Strike"
cuba.5.d_1:0 "As was feared, the turmoil in Havana has not dissipated. Indeed, it has only grown and even infected other major cities throughout the country. Worse yet, guerillas under the command of Socialist strongman Juan Blas Hernández, long relegated to the mountainous jungles of the south, have begun to raid nearby villages. The syndicalist paramilitary organisation, Joven Cuba has likewise resurfaced and begun a campaign of violence against government buildings and workers. While those elements of the military loyal to the civilian government have been critical in containing the chaos, Batista and the majority of the army still refuse to act. While we can attempt to suppress the strike with what units we have available, that will likely prove insufficient and only serve to galvanize opposition. What should be done?"
cuba.5.d_2:0 "As was feared, the turmoil in Havana has not dissipated. Indeed, it has only grown and even infected other major cities throughout the country. Worse yet, guerillas under the command of Socialist strongman Juan Blas Hernández, long relegated to the mountainous jungles of the south, have begun to raid nearby villages. The syndicalist paramilitary organisation, Joven Cuba has likewise resurfaced and begun a campaign of violence against government buildings and workers. While President Vázquez has successfully appealed to he and Batista's mutual benefactors in Washington to force the General into suppressing the strike, still the turmoil persists, and it is apparent that Díaz still refuses to commit the majority of his forces. What should be done?"
cuba.5.a:0 "Publicly offer concessions for peace."
cuba.5.b:0 "Attempt to suppress the strike."
cuba.5.c:0 "Continue to work with Batista."
cuba.5.d:0 "To hell with Batista, we'll end this alone"

cuba.6.t:0 "National Protection Act"
cuba.6.d_1:0 "In the wake of the strike, congress has narrowly passed a bill suspending many civil liberties and empowering the executive to suppress opposition by any means necessary. Without a Presidential signature, the bill will certainly not accrue the required legislative support to be enacted regardless. President Vázquez has expressed his whole-hearted support for the bill and will undoubtedly give it his signature."
cuba.6.d_2:0 "In the wake of the strike, congress has narrowly passed a bill suspending many civil liberties and empowering the executive to suppress opposition by any means necessary. Without a Presidential signature, the bill will certainly not accrue the required legislative support to be enacted regardless. President Barnet has not formerly indicated his intention. It is speculated that while he personally supports the bill, he fears the potential backlash in his breaking his earlier promises to the leaders of the strike."
cuba.6.d_3:0 "In the wake of the strike, congress has narrowly passed a bill suspending many civil liberties and empowering the executive to suppress opposition by any means necessary. Without a Presidential signature, the bill will certainly not accrue the required legislative support to be enacted regardless. President Trejo has openly expressed disgust at the mere existence of the bill and is certain to not give it his signature and has reasserted his commitment to making good on his promises to the strike's leaders. Perhaps if the Presidential Election had ended in a different result, the bill would have a chance at being enacted."
cuba.6.a:0 "This isn't worth the paper it's written on!"
cuba.6.b:0 "Sign it."

cuba.7.t:0 "Chaos"
cuba.7.d:0 "Our efforts to stop the strike failed; chaos consumed Havana and quickly swept the nation. With the civilian government fleeing the capital and its authority completely eroded, General Batista made his move. All roads in and out of Havana were blocked by army units and several major government buildings came under military control. Now, a great standoff has developed just outside of the Presidential Palace, where the last revolution also came to a head, between armed protestors organized in an impromptu militia structure and Díaz's army. The winner it seems, will take all."
cuba.7.a:0 "The Army disperses the strikers."
cuba.7.b:0 "The strikers repulse the army."

cuba.8.t:0 "Auténtic Paramilitaries"
cuba.8.d:0 "While the general strike succeeded in toppling the government and breaking the army, its internal divisions between moderates and radicals, and even between different socialist factions, prevented any new government from being formed. Seeing an opportunity, the Auténticos, who had laid low throughout the turmoil, once again emerged. Their paramilitaries, which have only grown in strength and discipline since their criminalisation, have already captured several important towns and cities. They are now readying to take complete control of the city of Havana, once and for all putting an end to their bitter rivals and former allies, the socialists. If the atrocities they have already committed against those accused of holding socialist sentiments in the areas under Auténtic control are any indication, Havana's streets will again run red."
cuba.8.a:0 "Socialists repulse the Auténticos."
cuba.8.b:0 "Auténticos seize Havana."

### Socialist Chain
cuba.9.t:0 "The Cuban Revolution"
cuba.9.d:0 "At last, with the Auténtico threat overcome, a new socialist government has been formed. While the old Constitution currently remains in effect and no significant structural reforms have yet been passed, Socialists have taken full control of the state. Antonio Guiteras of the dominant syndicalist faction within the rapidly disintegrating umbrella party, the 'Socialist Movement', has been appointed interim President while the form and structure of the regime is cemented. Already, bands of revolutionaries loyal to the new regime have stormed several American-owned plantations and done unspeakable things to any Americans found. As well, the militias, which were key to the success of the revolution, have been organised into the new Cuban Revolutionary Army."
cuba.9.a:0 "Break the chains."

cuba.10.t:0 "Socialist Power Struggle"
cuba.10.d:0 "Once united in opposition, the various factions within the ruling 'Socialist Movement' coalition have been unable to cooperate and the resulting gridlock has prevented reform. The revolution, it seems, has been put on hold while its greatest exponents squabble. President Guiteras has worked tirelessly to resolve the various disputes at the heart of the gridlock, and in a last-ditch effort to preserve the revolution, Guiteras has proposed for the existing governmental structure to be thrown out entirely and an All-Socialist Congress be held to definitively set such issues to rest. Behind this veneer of benevolence however, the President fears the worst and has begun to quietly assemble an impromptu force of his most loyal supporters. Should the other factions not accept his proposal, he will move to occupy the legislature."
cuba.10.a:0 "The congress is called."

While there, his already atypical dedication to the largely moribund ideals of the unsuccessful revolution in Russia and unequivocal rejection of syndicalism were tempered by the success of Mexico's agrarianism. He subsequently theorised an entirely new strain of Socialism tailored to the realities of an agrarian nation such as Cuba. 'Transformationism', as he labels it, advocates the complete and unending mobilisation of rural labourers as the only way to achieve a Utopian society. Socialist Democracy, which Mella championed while a student a decade ago, he now says is a farce, a mere distraction from the ultimate goal of societal transformation so complete that true democracy can be achieved. At last, now President, Mella's ideas can be put into practice."

With Comrade Blas now at the helm of our government, our primary policy focus should be the empowerment of the rural peasantry and the development of the many small villages which dot the countryside as well as the democratisation of the now state-controlled plantations which serve as the backbone of the rural economy. To do so, it is necessary that the people own the lands they work while still owing responsibility to state production directives. As such, these newly created parcels shall be grouped geographically with each region electing from amongst itself representatives to act as liasons between it and our government."

In the early hours of the morning, small groups of well-armed reactionaries rose up in every major city. After several hours of fighting, the attempt seemed destined to fail, but just as our success seemed all but assured, horrible news reached the capital: seemingly from nowhere, a force of several thousand led by none other than General Batista, who had seemingly vanished following the success of the revolution, had landed around the village of Trinidad and seized control of the area. With the army occupied suppressing insurrection, mounting an effective defence has thus far proven difficult and Díaz has taken control of much of central Cuba, splitting our forces in two. He now marches his army towards Havana. It appears that he also has significant support in the form of poorly disguised American aircraft and surely set sail from the United States himself.

From the outskirts of Pinar Del Rio, after days of heavy fighting against reactionary insurrection, a great many armed patriots rushed to Havana's defence. The ensuing battle just to the south of the city was the bloodiest on our nation's soil since the war of independence, but in spite of the odds, our men emerged triumphant, killing general Díaz in the process. [Root.GetLeader] has given a rousing speech from the balcony of the Presidential palace denouncing the United States for its hand in the coup attempt and boasted of the total defeat of American imperialism.

Trabajadores delegates proposed that the executive be much the same as it has been - directly elected, independent and both head of the government and the state as well as head of the party apparatus. Comunista delegates argued in response that the executive must be appointed by the party to assure the development of Socialism in the face of reactionary infiltration of the legislature. Revolucionario delegates, outraged by both proposals instead put forth that the head of government and the party should be elected by members of the elected legislature and accountable to it.

He and many supporters from within the Comunista faction have attempted to do just that. As Guiteras was walking out of the Presidential Palace a mob suddenly descended on him, killed his guards, and took him hostage. Meanwhile, several Comunista congressman openly brandished weapons in the hall of congress, calling for the abrogation of the new constitution and the appointment of Mella as President.

It has become increasingly apparent that our nation will never truly be free from reactionary influence unless we actively combat counter-revolutionaries. To that end, the governing Revolucionario faction has begun to organise from the ranks of its former guerillas a group dedicated to rooting out cabals and individuals that conspire against our regime. Members of the faction, however, disagree as to how this new organisation should be structured. One idea involves establishing what amounts to a permanent guerilla army separate from the armed forces. This new army would be embedded in society with each cell becoming intimately familiar with the geography of its immediate area, capable of quickly organising a local militia to combat whatever army or rebel group threatens its zone of operations. During times of peace, guerillas would be tasked with covertly promoting the regime and revolutionary values. Some however, criticize this far-fetched idea on the basis that it does nothing to actually combat non-violent and advocate for a more conventional organisation which operates as a domestic intelligence agency in all but name. Further, this proposed organisation, referred to simply as 'The Department' would be integrated into the party apparatus to ensure its absolute loyalty."
cuba.47.d_2:0 "It has become increasingly apparent that our nation will never truly be free from reactionary influence unless we actively combat counter-revolutionaries. With the need for a new counter-revolutionary organisation increasing, General-Secretary Mella has brought forward a plan to reform several militia groups which have proven thoroughly loyal and fanatically revolutionary to into a new paramilitary secret police organisation known as the 'Revolutionary Guard'. Alternatively, Mella has noted that it may before more effective to task the new guard not with ensuring discipline and loyalty among the militias, but to focus on investigating dissent and inefficiency among officers and military administration. The only question now is where the foul stain of reaction is hiding."

Unfortunately, however, following the success of the revolution, it quickly fell in disrepair as the militias which were essential to the success of the Havana General Strike have taken on a much greater role both in safeguarding the party and the nation. Not one to forget his friends though, Guiteras has begun to attempt to revitalise the organisation. As it has become increasingly apparent that our nation will never truly be free from reactionary influence unless we actively combat counter-revolutionaries, Joven Cuba's leadership has proposed that the organisation be integrated into the structure of the militias to monitor their loyalty and promote discipline, ensuring that the stain of reaction never spreads throughout the ranks.

As it has become increasingly apparent that our nation will never truly be free from reactionary influence unless we actively combat counter-revolutionaries, former members of the CNOC familiar with its operation have proposed to President Peña that the tactics the CNOC once employed against the old regime could still be relevant to the prevention of reactionary corruption. Specifically, CNOC was incredibly effective at promoting a socialist consciousness among Cuba's workers and its membership increased year on year without fail. This mass mobilisation could be utilized in one of two ways. Either relevant ex-CNOC members could be tasked with mobilising the bureaucracy to fight reaction there or do the same among the militias.

Comrade Roa has begun to attempt to revitalise the organisation while limiting Guiteras's personal influence. As it has become increasingly apparent that our nation will never truly be free from reactionary influence unless we actively combat counter-revolutionaries, Joven Cuba's leadership has proposed that the organisation be integrated into the structure of the militias to monitor their loyalty and promote discipline, ensuring that the stain of reaction never spreads throughout the ranks. Roa, however, favours keeping the organisations separate and instead investing in transforming Joven Cuba into the official paramilitary wing of the entire Socialist Movement and task it with preventing reactionary influence on the bureaucracy."

Following Auténtico victory, known socialist figures who failed to escape the city were promptly brutalised by the Greenshirts, with or without the approval of Ramon Grau. This new government which has arisen is in some ways similar to the last, immediately promising economic reform and an end to foreign domination, but the radicalisation of the Auténtic party has left it with a burning hatred for socialism.

To avoid any disruption of the economy it may be best to formulate a compromise with the Americans whereby we pledge to continue to respect American-owned plantations in exchange for American acceptance of our right to regulate these plantations.

Some officers believe that modern warfare has made defence-minded organisational structures and doctrines obsolete, while others firmly disagree, arguing that as a small island nation, Cuba must be focused on its defence rather than unsustainable campaigns."

cuba.148.d:0 "Cuba has declined to provide further industrial assistance."
cuba.148.a:0 "Disappointing."

cuba.149.t:0 "Cuba Supports Dissidents"
cuba.149.d:0 "While Socialist Cuba initially signalled its intention remain entirely uninvolved in our civil war, with the collapse of the Combined Syndicates, that position changed. The Cubans are now funneling monetary and armaments support to socialist dissidents throughout the remain factions in the war, our own country included."
cuba.149.a:0 "Damn Them!"

cuba.150.t:0 "Cubans Sends Military Support"
cuba.150.d:0 "It seems Cuba has thrown their lot fully in with our own. Despite the limited size of its armed forces, Cuba has organized several state-sanctioned volunteer divisions to fight on our side in the Civil War."
cuba.150.a:0 "Truly, humanity united knows no bounds."
cuba.150.b:0 "One step closer to victory."

cuba.151.t:0 "Planning The War With The Union State"
cuba.151.d:0 "The potential for Union State victory in the civil war is an existential threat to our nation, and one that we shall at last attempt to resolve. However, two distinct plans have been proposed by our civilian and military advisers. We could, of course, organize a full-scale invasion, landing troops in Union State controlled Florida. Alternatively, we could begin a campaign of sabotage across those areas under Union State control, perhaps weakening their war effort to the point of defeat."
cuba.151.a:0 "Prepare for all-out war."
cuba.151.b:0 "Send in the saboteurs."

cuba.152.t:0 "Cuba Attracting Dissidents"
cuba.152.d:0 "Socialist Cuba, dismayed by the collapse of the CSA, has proclaimed its intention to accept any and all Americans who choose to seek asylum on its shores. Rumors abound that Cuban agents have also entered our borders to facilitate the evacuation of socialists and other dissidents. While this has yet to cause much of an impact, some known opposition groups have begun to stir, perhaps in preparation of fleeing to Cuba."
cuba.152.a:0 "Troubling."

cuba.153.t:0 "Flow Of Dissidents To Cuba"
cuba.153.d:0 "Over the past month, several thousand dissidents have left territories under our control for Cuba. While this has drained out reserves of men a fair bit, those who remain are more likely to be loyal to our government."
cuba.153.a:0 "We're better off without them."

cuba.1530.t:0 "American Socialists Arrive"
cuba.1530.d:0 "We have assessed the influx of refugees from war-torn America for the first time, counting several thousand arrivals, most of them of age and fully willing to serve in our armed forces if the need ever arises."
cuba.1530.a:0 "Welcome!"

cuba.154.t:0 "Flow Of Dissidents To Cuba Slows"
cuba.154.d:0 "While the rate of emigration has slowed considerably, in the last two months, a few thousand more disgruntled individuals left for Cuba."
cuba.154.a:0 "So be it."

cuba.1540.t:0 "More American Socialists Arrive"
cuba.1540.d:0 "Over the past two months, several thousand more Americans of fighting age arrived on our shores. While the great influx following the start of the policy appears to be winding down, there should continue to be a steady trickle over time."
cuba.1540.a:0 "Welcome!"

cuba.155.t:0 "War With The Union State"
cuba.155.d:0 "Preparations for war have been completed and set in motion. While the odds are certainly against our victory in this war, like David slew Goliath, we shall fell the Union State. Or, at the very least, weaken sufficiently to bring about its defeat in the civil war."
cuba.155.a:0 "Like David and Goliath."

cuba.156.t:0 "Saboteurs Ready"
cuba.156.d:0 "After weeks of preparation and the smuggling of groups of trained soldiers into America, our saboteurs are ready to spring into action across our enemy's major cities, striking key infrastructure before pulling out, hopefully without being detected. All that is needed now is one final go-ahead."
cuba.156.a:0 "Do it."

cuba.157.t:0 "Saboteurs"
cuba.157.d:0 "Our nation has been rocked by a series of explosions and sudden failures of key infrastructure and electrical systems. While the damage can be repaired relatively quickly and the damage is not too severe, in the short term our infrastructure may be partially impaired. Given the scale of the attacks, they were almost certainly carried out by a state actor looking to weaken our position in this terrible civil war. An investigation is under way to determine the culprit."
cuba.157.a:0 "We'll have our revenge."

cuba.158.t:0 "Cuba Declares War"
cuba.158.d:0 "Shockingly, Cuba, nearly irrelevant militarily, has attack Florida, land troops in the southern portion of the state. While we lack formal diplomatic ties with that horrid socialist nation, Cuba has formally presented our government with a declaration of war. Of course, while fighting the Cubans should be akin to swatting a fly, the distraction could affect our position in the civil war, which we suspect is Cuba's goal anyhow."
cuba.158.a:0 "We'll crush those fools!"

cuba.159.t:0 "Undermining The CSA"

cuba.159.a:0 "Join with Canada."
cuba.159.b:0 "Send in the saboteurs."

cuba.160.t:0 "Cuban Assistance?"
cuba.160.d:0 "Cuba has offered to join our war with the Combined Syndicates of America. While they wish to take up arms directly, perhaps the small nation could instead provide indirect support, assisting our arms production and supplying our troops."
cuba.160.a:0 "Brothers in arms."
cuba.160.b:0 "A support role."

cuba.161.t:0 "The Great White North"
cuba.161.d:0 "While our nation and the Combined Syndicates are not currently at war, such could break out at any time. Cuba as well fear CSA dominance and has offered to come to our aid, for whatever good that may do, it case of war."
cuba.161.a:0 "We stand as one."
cuba.161.b:0 "We don't need them."

cuba.162.t:0 "Our Place In The War"
cuba.162.d:0 "Canada has accepted our proposal to join in their war with the Combined Syndicates of America. While we have not fully thrown our lot in with the Entente, this represents a major step towards a formal military alliance with Canada."
cuba.162.a:0 "To arms!"

cuba.1620.t:0 "Cuba Joins The Fight"
cuba.1620.d:0 "Cuba has declared war upon the Combined Syndicates of America on our behalf. While they are not a military powerhouse by any means, their support is appreciated."
cuba.1620.a:0 "Wonderful!"

cuba.163.t:0 "Canada Asks For Support"
cuba.163.d:0 "Canada has declined our offer of direct military support in their war with the Combined Syndicates. However, the nation has instead proposed that we produce arms on Canada's behalf in exchange for compensation. While some in our foreign service see this offer as something of a slight, it still could contribute to the defeat of the reprehensible CSA."
cuba.163.a:0 "We Agree."
cuba.163.b:0 "Such disrespect!"

cuba.1630.t:0 "Cuba Accepts"
cuba.1630.d:0 "Cuba has agreed to support our armaments production. Perhaps this could be the start of a long and mutually beneficial relationship."
cuba.1630.a:0 "A wonderful development!"

cuba.1631.t:0 "Cuba Declines"
cuba.1631.d:0 "Cuba has declined to support our armaments production, producing accusing our government of some sort of unspecified slight."
cuba.1631.a:0 "An overreaction."

cuba.164.t:0 "Canada Accepts"
cuba.164.d:0 "Canada has accepted our offer. Our promise of support against the CSA has been a major boon to mutual relations."
cuba.164.a:0 "Wonderful!"

cuba.1640.t:0 "Canada Goes To War"
cuba.1640.d:0 "War has broken out between the CSA and Canada. Per our earlier promise, we should also now declare war upon the Combined Syndicates."
cuba.1640.a:0 "We must fight!"

cuba.165.t:0 "Identity of Saboteurs Uncovered"
cuba.165.d:0 "The nation responsible for the attacks of a month ago has been uncovered beyond a shadow of a doubt: Cuba. While we have protested diplomatically, the Cubans have been unrepentant, nearly mocking in response."
cuba.165.a:0 "Declare War."
cuba.165.b:0 "Once the war is over..."

cuba.166.t:0 "Canada Disregards Us"
cuba.166.d:0 "Canada has rejected our benevolent offer of support against the Combined Syndicates of America."
cuba.166.a:0 "To hell with them!"

cuba.167.t:0 "Volunteers Return Home"
cuba.167.d:0 "Cuban-American volunteers who joined with our invasion of the American Union State have returned home with the end of the war."
cuba.167.a:0 "Their service was appreciated."

cuba.168.t:0 "Militiamen Return To Cuba"
cuba.168.d:0 "Militiamen who so bravely volunteered for the first wave of clandestine landings in Florida for our war against the Union State have now returned to Cuba."
cuba.168.a:0 "Back into the fold."

cuba.169.t:0 "Cuban Volunteers Go Home"

### Late Game Focus Trees

cuba.200.t:0 "Triumph Of Liberty"
cuba.200.d:0 "Over the past few weeks, a strange feeling has settled over the nation. A Strange feeling, quite foreign, but by no means bad - far from it actually. Not only have the plethora of challenges to our democracy been vanquished, but the system that has emerged and the policy adjustments which were undertaken in response to the crisis have now become entirely normalised. Democracy itself, it seems, has not only survived, but become entirely mundane, entirely normal. With this shift in attitudes, we can at last begin to not just consolidate and protect the system, but look to the future."
cuba.200.a:0 "If only Martí could see us now."

cuba.201.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: Positive Rights?"
cuba.201.d:0 "The constitutional convention has now begun, with delegates from all major political parties and influential figures from across the country attending as voting delegates and observers. While the first several hours were quite productive, the fundamental nature of much of the language used in the document has become a point of contention, with Liberals preferring to exclusively define what the government should be barred from doing and Unionistas preferring that language also imply a positive obligation of the government towards assuring certain realities for the people."
cuba.201.a:0 "Unionista arguments prevail."
cuba.201.b:0 "The Liberals are correct."

cuba.202.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: Discrimination"
cuba.202.d:0 "The inclusion of a passage aimed at addressing racial discrimination has become the next significant point of contention in the drafting of the new constitution. Individuals within all the major political parties object to the inclusion of the passage, arguing that such an effort to end discrimination should be addressed through normal legislation rather than mar our constitution with such an ugly and inherently divisive issue."
cuba.202.a:0 "The passage is included."
cuba.202.b:0 "Never!"

cuba.203.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: The Highest Court?"
cuba.203.d:0 "One final issue has prevented the Convention from adjourning once and for all. Modelled on that of the United States, the Cuban Supreme Court was meant to be independent of the other branches of government, but it became anything but. While many insist that the court simply lacked the supporting institutions to function properly, others now wish to restructure it completely and state its political mission more explicitly within the constitution."
cuba.203.a:0 "Keep the status quo."
cuba.203.b:0 "Restructure the court."

cuba.204.t:0 "The General"
cuba.204.d:0 "General Batista, not even yet fourty years of age, has become larger than life, larger than the nation itself in the minds of many and with time, his control has only solidified. With crisis now a thing of the past, he can at last transition from consolidation of his rule and truly grasp the reigns of state and the people."
cuba.204.a:0 "Hail!"

cuba.205.t:0 "Machado's Man"
cuba.205.d:0 "Clemente Vázquez Bello, once a key ally of Machado has followed in his deposed mentor's footsteps, steadily consolidating his rule to now stand largely unopposed. While many common people bear great enmity towards our magnanimous President, his rule, it seems, will only be ended by the reaper himself."
cuba.205.a:0 "Live long and prosper."

cuba.206.t:0 "Vázquez Is Shot!"
cuba.206.d:0 "Shocking news has arrived today from Havana; while leaving a theatre with his wife, President Vázquez was shot several times by a lone gunman and was pronounced dead at the scene. Succession to is entirely uncertain and various factions within our nation's government have begun to mobilize. Senator Mendieta, a moderate and once-opponent of Vazquez, has been appointed to the Presidency in an extraordinary Congressional session while a more permanent successor is decided upon."
cuba.206.a:0 "We stand on the brink."

cuba.207.t:0 "Reform?"
cuba.207.d_1:0 "While President Mendieta has managed to contain the situation, Vázquez's sudden passing has upended the political order yet again and for fear of resurgent opposition, factions within our government now push for gradual reform as a means to maintain power. Chief among the prospective reformers is the influential José Agripino Barnet, whom the ex-Mambi Orestes Ferrara Marino himself has come out of retirement to throw in his lot with, within the foreign service. Mendieta himself, while not opposed to reform, is fearful of the return of the chaos that plagued the Unionista regime and has indicated his desire to resign the Presidency in favour of Barnet should the preservation of the status quo prove impossible."
cuba.207.d_2:0 "President Mendieta has proven totally incapable of containing the political fallout from Vázquez's sudden passing, and with our essential relationship with the United States weakened, reform seems now all but guaranteed. How that reform shall take shape however is anyone's guess. Within the foreign service, the influential José Agripino Barnet, whom the ex-Mambi Orestes Ferrara Marino himself has come out of retirement to throw in his lot with, gathers support for a more moderate agenda of gradual democratisation while the Nuevo Liberal party, which previous lent our regime its support, now calls for slightly more radical change. While the Nuevo Liberals are the more powerful political entity, Mendieta now must consider his own resignation in favour of Barnet in order to preserve some modicum of the status quo."
cuba.207.a:0 "Maintain the regime."
cuba.207.b:0 "Mendieta resigns."
cuba.207.c:0 "The New Liberals sweep to power!"

cuba.208.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: Strength Of The Executive"
cuba.208.d:0 "With delegates having arrived from across the country, mostly from local governments and the national legislature, the Constitutional Convention has just begun. While the first several hours were productive, the structure of the executive branch has become a point of contention. Some delegates wish that the Presidency remain much the same as it now while other delegates argue that Presidential powers to pardon criminals and appoint judges should instead be invested in the legislature, arguing that those powers had been abused flagrantly in the past. While President Barnet has agreed to abide by the spirit of the proposed restrictions as part of a 'gentleman's agreement', he and his cabinet members argue that writing such a provision into the constitution could be detrimental in times of war."
cuba.208.a:0 "Restrict presidential authority."
cuba.208.b:0 "Keep the status quo."

cuba.209.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: Unicameral Legislature?"
cuba.209.d:0 "The convention is coming along well and our grand new founding document is a sight to behold. Another issue has caused great divide however: the nature of the national legislature. While our legislative body has been bicameral after the model of the United States, many reformers now wish to make it unicameral to simplify the legislative process and promote the ability of the populace to understand the division of political power. What should be done?"
cuba.209.a:0 "Unicameral."
cuba.209.b:0 "Keep the bicameral structure."

cuba.210.t:0 "Constitutional Convention: Ugly Past"
cuba.210.d:0 "Just as the convention prepared to adjourn, a group of average citizens burst into the chamber, shouting and screaming with security seemingly nowhere in sight. They demanded that some recognition of the state's obligation to not repeat its past behaviours both under Vázquez, Díaz, and the brief socialist regime. While they will almost certainly be removed from the building soon enough and do not appear armed, perhaps including such a provision could be wise and assuage public distrust."
cuba.210.a:0 "Write it in."
cuba.210.b:0 "Wait them out."

cuba.211.t:0 "The Future Of Socialism"
cuba.211.d:0 "The fires of revolution have faded, and upon its ashes, the foundations for socialism have been built, the future of humanity of itself. Now we must look not simply to consolidation, but to our nation's future."
cuba.211.a:0 "Viva Cuba Libre!"

cuba.212.t_1:0 "Settling In"
cuba.212.t_2:0 "Full Democratisation"
cuba.212.d_1:0 "What began with the revolution has come to fruition. Socialism has come fully to Cuba and the firm hand that guided this transition shall remain."
cuba.212.d_2:0 "With our rule cemented and societal norms undergoing a satisfactory shift, we can now begin the process of democratisation anew. Let the tyrants of the world hear our rallying cry as we build in Cuba a true syndicalist democracy."
cuba.212.a:0 "The immortal science!"

cuba.213.t:0 "Mella Established Political Dominance"
cuba.213.d_1:0 "The revolution left Cuba in a vulnerable position. Now our fearless leader, Julio Antonio Mella has returned to us, to guide the nation. We shall rise from the ashes of the reactionary, bourgeoisie dictatorship with our faces held high towards the dawn!"
cuba.213.d_2:0 "The accord between the Comunista and Revolucionario factions has held and the Trabajadores have been reduced in influence as a result. As many predicted however, cracks have begun to form as our nation has stepped further into socialism's light. To what extent shall Mella's grand vision for Cuba come to pass?"
cuba.213.a:0 "Onwards!"

cuba.214.t:0 "The Status Quo?"
cuba.214.d:0 "The initial deal forged in the aftermath of Revolucionario victory in the special session of the all-socialist congress is dead. The Revolucionarios and Comunistas are armed and fully at each other's throats. A battle is coming."
cuba.214.a:0 "Who shall be victorious?"

cuba.2140.t:0 "The Streets Again Run Red"
cuba.2140.d_1:0 "While the Revolucionarios held firm and retained political primacy in the informal coalition with the Comunistas, Mella's ambition is truly insatiable. Today, groups of Comunista fanatics with arms procured by Comunista leadership opened fire on a group of Revolucionario-affiliated government workers over some minor interpersonal dispute. The trouble quickly spread and now barricades have been erected across the city of Havana and intermittent gunfire is heard as both sides prepare for more violence. In the legislature, Blas, Mella, and their respective factions are likewise in a standoff."
cuba.2140.d_2:0 "While the Revolucionarios flagged and lost political primacy in the informal coalition with the Comunistas, Blas is not to be outdone without a fight. Today, groups of Comunista fanatics with arms procured by Comunista leadership opened fire on a group of Revolucionario-affiliated government workers over some minor interpersonal dispute. The trouble quickly spread and now barricades have been erected across the city of Havana and intermittent gunfire is heard as both sides prepare for more violence. In the legislature, Blas, Mella, and their respective factions are likewise in a standoff."
cuba.2140.a:0 "The Comunistas pull off a miracle."
cuba.2140.b:0 "The Revolucionarios back down."
cuba.2140.c:0 "The Revolucionarios are crushed."
cuba.2140.e:0 "The Revolucionarios pull off a miracle."
cuba.2140.f:0 "The Comunistas back down."
cuba.2140.g:0 "The Comunistas are crushed."

cuba.2141.t:0 "A Great Day"
cuba.2141.d:0 "After months of internal conflict, the Revolucionarios have been defeated. Conscious of appearances and having achieved many of his goals anyhow, Mella has signalled his intention to retain policies developed under the coalition government. Blas has disappeared seemingly into thin air, with his position within the Revolucionario faction now headed by the influential military-man Alberto Bayo."
cuba.2141.a:0 "The real Revolucionarios!"

cuba.2142.t:0 "A Farewell To Arms"
cuba.2142.d:0 "After months of internal conflict, the Comunistas have been defeated. Mella, it seems, has fled the country once again. Perhaps one day he me yet again return..."
cuba.2142.a:0 "The storm is weathered!"

cuba.215.t:0 "Two Revolutionaries Enter"
cuba.215.d:0 "The highly publicized one-on-one meeting between Blas and Mella has begun. Within the first few minutes of conversation, pleasantries have turned to debate and anger. Primary among the issues so hotly contested is how our agrarian system might yet be improved. Mella stands firm that the institutions established in the initial wave of transformationist reforms following the socialist congress must be fine-tuned while Blas proposes that the rural masses must be the target of a campaign of political education and further attention paid to resource extraction."
cuba.215.a:0 "Blas concedes the point."
cuba.215.b:0 "Mella drops the issue."

cuba.2150.t:0 "Optimisation"
cuba.2150.d:0 "With the economic issue out of the way for now, Blas and Mella now argue about the proper way by which efficiency might be ensured in highly politicized bureaucratic positions. Mella argue to simply enforce normal regulations and punishments without exception while Blas instead proposes that each department should create a directly elected board to supervise its activities and produce efficiency reports for our government."
cuba.2150.a:0 "Use the stick."
cuba.2150.b:0 "Create Blas's committees."

cuba.2151.t:0 "Improving The Militias"
cuba.2151.d:0 "While reorganisation of the militia structure of our army is an ongoing debate within the armed forces, additional reforms have been proposed by both Blas and Mella, hoping to leverage their respective influences within various militias for political gain. Both plans hold substantial merit in of themselves however and our armed forces will surely benefit either way with the guiding hand of either man."
cuba.2151.a:0 "Mella overwhelms Blas with facts and logic."
cuba.2151.b:0 "Blas successfully makes his case."

cuba.216.t:0 "Social Equalisation"
cuba.216.d:0 "Mella's antagonisation has prompted Blas and the Revolucionarios to propose a competing plan to Mella's plan to implement the social aspects of his transformationist ideology. While both plans call for aggressive state action to bring about gender and racial equality, the exact specifics differ."
cuba.216.a:0 "Mella's plan is superior."
cuba.216.b:0 "We'll go with Blas."
cuba.216.c:0 "Compromise."

cuba.217.t:0 "Opening Up"
cuba.217.d:0 "Following the deposition of both Guiteras and Mella, Blas has stood alone as by far the most influential political figure in the country. While that power has allowed for Blas's desired reforms to be enacted and the nation's transformation begun, the undemocratic means by which he ascended to power have proven troublesome to he and his fellows, who claim to aspire to the highest of democratic ideals. Indeed, even the failed socialist congress proposed by Guiteras originally had seem to Blas to be but a sham masquerading as democratic. With the political direction the time to re-open the political sphere has come."
cuba.217.a:0 "Viva Cuba Libre!"

cuba.218.t:0 "The New State"
cuba.218.d:0 "Like when the guns fell silent in the Weltkrieg, the end of insurrection brought only an eerie silence, not peace. However, as our government has strengthened its rule and assuaged the economic woes which have plagued us for over a decade, we have re-awoken in the people that indomitable spirit that defined them in times of old. We can now at long last turn to the future; with President Grau at the helm, no man shall again wallow in poverty nor socialism again threaten our land. This bold new state which is in birth shall be a sight to behold indeed."
cuba.218.a:0 "Arise Cuba fair!"

cuba.2180.t:0 "Havana We Have A Problem."
cuba.2180.d:0 "Thanks to our previous decision to expand the Greenshirts, the organization grew rapidly. Its most radical members capitalized on this growth to bring new members to their cause. The so called National Revolutionary Legion that these men founded grew significantly in recent months, and it members grew further dissatisfied with the policies of the Grau administration.\n\nThough the legionarries are few in number, they rank highly in various bureaucratic entities, and their ambition knows no bounds. When President Grau left the city of Havana today, the Legionaries made their grab for power. Though many Greenshirts still remain loyal to Grau, the military has refused to intervene as the situation in Havana has developed. The situation, it seems, is that the Legionaries have seized control of the capital and declared their leader, the author Alberto Lamar Schweyer, as acting president."
cuba.2180.a:0 "Surely this won't last."

cuba.2181.t:0 "That Didn't Take Long"
cuba.2181.d:0 "Already, the provisional government, if it can even yet be called that, of the Legionary faction of the Greenshirts has begun to fray. Since his overthrow, Grau and his loyalists simply left the major cities while much of the armed forces have continued to refuse to take up arms at all, looking for an inroad back to power. That opportunity has now come in the form of the Legionary interior secretary, the famous aviator Augustin Parla Orduna. The famous Orduna, who personally comamnds the loyalty of many of the Legionaires, has begun to fall out of favor with his comrades. He has offered to assist the Grau loyalists in reclaiming Havana in exchange for a position in Grau's cabinet."
cuba.2181.a:0 "President Grau is re-instated."
cuba.2181.b:0 "Grau refused the deal."

cuba.219.t:0 "AND Reinvigorated"
cuba.219.d:0 "The Asociación Nacional Democrática has become moribund in recent years. Even as part of the coalition that contested the 1936 elections, ex-president Menocal failed to make much headway. That has now all changed. The moderate Carlos Prío Socarrás, suspiciously soon after the government's announcement of a normalization of the political sphere and the scheduling of new election, has begun to court prominent members of the AND, for all intents and purposes amidst present political realities, forming a new AND of sorts under his own, state sanctioned, leadership."
cuba.219.a:0 "Surely he is but a puppet of Grau."

cuba.2190.t:0 "Opening Up The Political Sphere"
cuba.2190.d:0 "Though political parties remain, in theory, unrestricted, great institutional pressure has been placed on the opposition and many individuals have been subjected to intimidation by Greenshirt groups. President Prios, now in control, in poised to end these practices. As the Unionists, not entirely opposed to the Authentic party were subjected to a far lower degree of suppression, it is certain that they shall form the main opposition."

cuba.221.d:0 "France has gone through with its designs to hold the First Congress of the Third International, and despite the recency of our revolution, we have received an invitation. Attending is certainly tempting, and it would undoubtedly afford a degree of legitimacy to our new regime, but with our political situation still unresolved sending important officials to such an event will likely contribute to further instability."

cuba.222.t:0 "National Symbolism"
cuba.222.d:0 "The Cuban flag is beloved by the people for its association both with early struggles for independence and the great patriot José Martí. The flag, however, among other national symbols, is intertwined with bourgeoisie corruption contradictory to the socialist nature of our new nation. Some have called for such symbols to be replaced, beginning with the national flag. The most prominent proposal for a new flag is based upon the Céspedes flag, a banner still with a bourgeoisie designer, but also more explicitly revolutionary, with modifications to make the new flag sufficiently socialist. Besides the national flag, many also call for the independence holiday to be moved from May 20th, a date connected to American imperialism, to October 10th, the date when in 1868, the Cuban independence movement began in earnest."

cuba.223.d:0 "While overwhelmingly catholic, many Afro-Cubans incorporate elements of traditional West-African religions, especially the religion of the Yoruba people, into their religious practices. To those not born into this belief system, many of these syncretic customs are shocking and morally reprehensible, even bordering on satanic.\nRecently, rumors that some worshippers have begun to sacrifice young children as part of an occult ritual have run amuck. While for a time, the rumors seemed to have died down, today, a group of men have arrived in Havana claiming to have travelled from Oriente province with an alleged devil worshipper, a slight Afro-Cuban woman, trailing behind them with her hands and feet bound. The woman, they say, had murdered her own child to commune with some perverse demon and authorities in Oriente had refused to discipline her. While there is a lack of evidence to point to any actual wrongdoing on her part and a plethora to justify arresting the vigilantes, the case has caused a ruckus in Havana and calls for a national investigation into the alleged sacrifice are prominent."

Given our current war against Germany, he will be tried by military tribunal as an enemy combatant and likely given the death penalty. This is, of course, unless his sentence is commuted to mere jail time by our administration."

He is now demanding that Peña step down as not only chair of the CNOC, but also as Cuba's executive."

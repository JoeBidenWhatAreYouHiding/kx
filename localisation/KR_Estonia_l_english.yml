### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HENGO_TULNOLA_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! October 16th, 1897, in Navi, Werro District, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Hengo Tulnola is an enigmatic figure. Unable to finish his secondary education, he was drafted into the Russian army in the summer of 1916 and would rise to the rank of junior officer. During the chaos of 1917, he returned to Estonia and joined the growing independence movement, eventually fighting in the Estonian War of Independence against the United Baltic Duchy. Injured in combat, he fled with the rest of his comrades and was forced into exile.\n\nAfter several unsuccessful ventures, including a stint as a goldsmith, Tulnola would come to pass his time recording as much as he could of the Estonian independence movements into history. These publications earned him the attention of the Estonian émigré community, and he came into contact with the pagan Taaraist movement, which he would soon become a member of. Tulnola would utilise his heroic military history and influence over Estonian nationalist history to become a prominent ultra-nationalist, eventually becoming the head of the Estonian National Directorate.\n\nNow that the directorate is in power, Hengo Tulnola and the directorate can establish their vision of a nationalist, strong Estonia. It remains to be seen just how much influence his Taaraist beliefs will have on how he leads his nation."
POLITICS_ARTUR_SIRK_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! September 25th, 1900, in Pruuna, Jerwen District, Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! From his teenage years up to now, Artur Sirk has spent his entire life fighting for Estonia. Volunteering during the Estonian War of Independence, he fought tooth and nail until the very last of the freedom fighters were routed from their homeland. As the fires of the struggle dimmed to embers and then to ashes once the United Baltic Duchy secured its rule over Estonia, Sirk would study law and diligently bide his time until his battered nation recouped its strength and awakened once more.\n\nSirk's prominence in the exile community grew strong as he became deputy chairman of the Eesti Vabadussõjalaste Liit (Union of Participants in the Estonian War of Independence), becoming its deputy chairman and establishing a breadth of connections among fellow veterans of the War of Independence. By 1930, Sirk had become one of the most well-known and charismatic Estonian nationalists. When the Estonian National Congress was called in Petrograd, there were few more galvanizing choices of leadership than Sirk himself.\n\nOne of Sirk's first initiatives was the reformation of the Omakaitse, and ever since he has slowly increased his power and influence within the paramilitary. Despite his popularity, fellow members of the National Committee view him with derision, seeing him as a demagogue who will merely replace a foreign oppressor with a native oppressor.\n\nIn the aftermath of Estonia's rise to independence, it is now Artur Sirk who holds the reins. Believing that no other man is capable enough for the job, he has little intention of leaving the fate of his country up to any other man. Sirk envisions a centralised, unified, and secure Estonia; one in which democracy will not survive."
POLITICS_JURI_ULUOTS_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 13th, 1890, in Kirbla, Wiek District, Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Jüri Uluots has been an esteemed practitioner of law and a powerful and connected member of Estonian political society for a long time. Uluots graduated in 1916 from St. Petersburg University with a law degree and diligently maintained his studies at the University of Tartu.\n\nUluots would become one of the primary organisers of the Estonian National Congress of 1930, held in Petrograd, and would become an influential member of the National Committee of the Estonian Government-in-Exile. As Sirk continued to centralise his power and influence, Uluots formed the Isamaaliit and warily kept tabs on Sirk and the evolution of the Omakaitse.\n\nIn the end, Uluots' efforts would pay off tremendously. Having secured the presidency of the new Estonian republic, he intends to maintain his power and craft a secure and stable Estonia along corporatist lines. So long as he remains at the helm, the government of his nation will be centralised and streamlined, safeguarding the people from syndicalism and those who wish to undermine the strength of Estonia."
POLITICS_JAAN_TONISSON_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! December 22nd, 1868, in Tänassilma, Fellin District, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! For decades, Jaan Tõnisson has dedicated his efforts toward promoting Estonian independence. Having been part of the Estonian National Movement since the 19th century, his introduction to the nationalist front came through the Estonian Students' Society, which he joined while studying law at the University of Tartu.\n\nCome 1893, Tõnisson became the editor of one of the largest Estonian-language news publications in the Russian Empire, Postimees. Tõnisson used his platform to promote anti-Russification and quickly became one of the foremost personalities behind the Estonian national awakening. In just under a decade, he and fellow nationalist Konstantin Päts began a rivalry after Päts had started his own rival newspaper. Shortly after the Russian Revolution of 1905, Tõnisson was one of the primary founders of the Estonian National Progress Party, which would become the first legal Estonian political party within the Russian Empire.\n\nDuring the October Revolution, Tõnisson opposed the Bolsheviks and was responsible for securing the recognition of Estonia by the Entente. This proved to be ultimately meaningless, as when Germany occupied the Baltics and established the United Baltic Duchy, Estonia would be forced to fight for its independence alone, a fight which left them outgunned and outmatched. A participant of the 1930 Petrograd Estonian National Congress, Tõnisson established himself as a major power broker among exiles and would end up being one of Artur Sirk's biggest opponents within the movement.\n\nNow that democracy within Estonia has finally been secured after decades of struggle, Jaan Tõnisson is the man holding the seat of power. Tõnisson intends to solidify Estonia's young constitution and ensure his nation gets to maintain its hard-fought freedom."
POLITICS_OTTO_STRANDMAN_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! November 30th, 1875, in Vandu, Wierland District, Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Distinguishing himself as a consummate lawyer and economist, Otto Strandman has proven himself to be one of the most capable statesmen available to lead the fledgling Estonian republic. Strandman got his start defending Estonians against the privileged nobility and government officials in court, before being exiled for his radical beliefs during the Russian Revolution of 1905.\n\nInitially a radical socialist, Strandman would eventually return to the Governorate of Estonia, where he would continue to defend Estonian participants in the 1905 Revolution from prosecution. During the political chaos of Russia in 1917, Strandman rose from court prosecutor, to Reval city council member, to finally the Estonian Provincial Assembly. Strandman helped draft the initial reforms that led to Estonia's increased autonomy from the Russian government.\n\nDuring the Estonian War of Independence, Strandman was key in securing Swedish volunteers and had to sell much of his possessions to fund his trips to Stockholm. When the United Baltic Duchy cemented its control over Estonia, Strandman became a prominent exile and slowly moved toward the centre politically.\n\nNow that Estonia's past of imperial dominance is finally over, Strandman is charged with leading his nation to prosperity. Elected on a platform of land reform and agrarian protection, it remains to be seen how well the firebrand lawyer and speaker can fulfill his promises."
POLITICS_AUGUST_REI_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! March 22nd, 1886, in Kurla, Fellin District, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! August Rei has long established himself as not only a man dedicated to Estonia, but also to the complete freedom of its people. Rei's nationalist views led him to forestall his expulsion from the University of Tartu by pre-emptively leaving, before later finishing his education at the University of St. Petersburg. Rei became an early revolutionary socialist and was an active underground organiser during the Russian Revolution of 1905.\n\nBefore long, Rei attached himself to the burgeoning social-democratic movement and founded several publications promoting his views. During the Weltkrieg, Rei was an artillery officer, before returning to Reval in 1917 where he became instrumental in the raising of Estonian military units. Despite his efforts, the Estonian Provisional Government was crushed and several of its members would later go into exile.\n\nNow that the age of Baltic German dominance has finally met its end, August Rei can finally see his vision of a social-democratic Estonia come to fruition. Now that the presidency is his, he has vowed to enact sweeping land reform and will do everything in his power to keep Estonia's people free of tyranny, no matter the cost."
POLITICS_ARNOLD_SOMMERLING_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! July 23rd, 1898, in Reval, Harrien District, Governorate of Estonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Arnold Sommerling, born of a modest working-class family, graduated from the Reval School of Commerce in 1915. In 1917, he was conscripted into the army of the Russian Empire, before later working as a servant in the port of Reval.\n\nSommerling's radicalisation grew as he became heavily involved in Reval's trade unions, particularly as a secretary of the Harbor Loader's Union. Sommerling suffered under the heel of oppression against socialism conducted by the United Baltic Duchy, yet maintained his indignance and socialist beliefs.\n\nNow, it would appear the tables have turned. Arnold Sommerling is now fatefully the leader of a free and socialist Estonia. Tasked with safeguarding the freedom of his country's workers in an increasingly chaotic world, the road ahead is treacherous; though Sommerling passionately believes socialism is here to stay in Estonia, and vows to trounce all who dare challenge it."
POLITICS_JAAN_ANVELT_DESC:0 "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! April 18th, 1884, in Oorgu, Fellin District, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Jaan Anvelt, known also by several pseudonyms, began his life among the peasantry and took up the noble profession of a schoolteacher, before moving to St. Petersburg where he would study law. Anvelt joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and was expelled from university in 1911 for organising a student strike, though was allowed to graduate externally a year later. He would then organise and publish the socialist workers' newspaper Kiir and steadily became incredibly influential among Estonian socialist circles.\n\nIn 1917, he was elected to the Russian Provisional Province Assembly. Once the October Revolution kicked off, he joined the side of the Bolsheviks, becoming the chairman of the Estonian Soviet Executive Committee. Unfortunately for Anvelt, Estonia would not see the light of socialism and he was forced to look on as the United Baltic Duchy quashed the hopes of Estonian independence and the Bolsheviks collapsed. Afterward, he went underground but maintained his hopes for a firmly socialist Estonia.\n\nNow that the reactionaries have been ousted from the land of his people, Jaan Anvelt is in no mood for compromise and will spare no further quarter. Under his leadership, Estonia will become a bulwark of Eastern European socialism and the chains of its people broken permanently."

 EST_help_struggling_farmers_desc:0 "Estonia is an agrarian nation; agriculture amounts to nearly 59% of our nation's industry. We cannot turn a blind eye to those who are struggling in the fields. To help out those less fortunate farmers, we will offer them credit to allow them to buy modern farm tools to increase their productivity and the prosperity of our nation."

 EST_comprehensive_land_reform:0 "Comprehensive Land Reform"
 EST_comprehensive_land_reform_desc:0 "While our nation is finally embracing democracy, there must be comprehensive land reform to be made.

 EST_compromise_with_the_landowners_desc:0 "As part of our overall land reform, we must deal with the landowners in a way that doesn't completely eradicate them.

 EST_land_redistribution:0 "Land Redistribution"
 EST_land_redistribution_desc:0 "In our reforms to redistribute the land peacefully, we will create state departments to measure and divide land plots evenly.

 EST_mechanised_farming:0 "Mechanised Farming"
 EST_mechanised_farming_desc:0 "The average Estonian still lacks the tools and equipment of a modern agricultural nation. Even in the fields, the horse and oxen still reign supreme.

The government will provide credit for those who cannot afford such tools to modernize our nation."

 EST_communal_farms:0 "Communal Farms"
 EST_communal_farms_desc:0 "As part of our land reforms, we will have to address the situation of land ownership.

### Events ###
 KREST.1.t:0 "The Remnant Returns"
 KREST.1.d:0 "Both the Latvians and the Estonians cheered for the start of the Weltkrieg and supported the Russian war effort, believing that a display of patriotism would grant them autonomous status - and for Estonia, it appeared as if the gamble paid off. Estonia was granted national autonomy by the Russians after the February Revolution and elected its first government, the Maapaev - however, its time was short, as the outbreak of the October Revolution and the German invasion forced it to go underground. Before doing so, however, on February 24th, declared the independence of the Republic of Estonia and formed the Estonian Provisional Government.\n\nAs the German occupation turned permanent, the Estonian population increasingly turned towards resistance, often supported by the Bolsheviks next door - guerrilla warfare and even open fighting broke out between German occupation forces and the Omakaitse volunteers, until eventually, the Provisional Government was forced to flee, leaving the United Baltic Duchy behind and arriving to Scandinavian shores.\n\nDilapidated for a decade, it gained a new lease of life in 1930, when an Estonian National Congress was held in Petrograd and elected a new government in exile - headed by a veteran of the War of Independence and a talented speaker, Artur Sirk. Six years later, the United Baltic Duchy has fallen, and Estonian partisans welcome the return of their government in exile - however, not all is calm in Tallinn, as Sirk is an increasingly authoritarian leader and democracy in Estonia may flicker and die if he remains in charge..."
 KREST.1.a:0 "Estonia shall endure!"

 KREST.5.t:0 "Baltic Germans Request Schools"
 KREST.5.d:0 "A small group of Baltic Germans have requested Sirk's government representatives to be allowed to open schools with the language of instruction to be German opposed to Estonian. They do stress though that Estonian will be taught within these schools and are more than happy to submit their curriculum for vetting.\n\nThis has been seen as an option for Sirk and his government to take the higher ground over their former masters, but there are those in the government who can not turn the other cheek, and rather take an eye."
 KREST.5.a:0 "Let us appease them."
 KREST.5.b:0 "Only Estonian language is permitted in Estonia." 

 KREST.15.t:0 "The Decree of Tallinn"
 KREST.15.d:0 "In an announcement, Sirk decreed that the Omakaitse will answer to his office and not that of the Army. This has caused a public uproar, as many see this as another step taken by Sirk to become a Dictator of Estonia and that Sirk seeks to merely maintain his rule over Estonia. Both Uluots and Tõnisson have criticised Sirk stating that while most Estonians were fighting for their freedom, Sirk had fled to Finland and thus only barely participated in the national restoration. In response, Sirk blasted both Uluots and Tõnisson for seeking to divide the country and stated that both were merely attempting to sell Estonia to foreign powers. Either way, demands for a constitution are mounting with Sirk starting to find his position untenable" 
 KREST.15.a:0 "Well, straight into the fire it is."

 KREST.21.t:0 "Sirk Makes His Move"
 KREST.21.d:0 "With mounting demands on Sirk and the provisional government to allow a vote on a referendum for a constitution; Sirk, in a move to consolidate his powerbase, has formed the Eesti Vabadussõjalaste Liit, vabadussõjalased (Union of Participants in the Estonian War of Independence) or Vaps party. Now a "legitimate" party, Sirk has maneuvered himself into a position where he can dictate "terms" to the provisional government.\n\nThe terms highlight the creation of the office of President of Estonia, with legislative and executive powers, who would serve as the Head of State and Guide of the Nation, and approve himself Chairman of the Estonian National Committee, as the first President under this law. With the newly formed Vaps paramilitary guarding the Riigikogu to ensure that no "external" interruptions can occur."
 KREST.21.a:0 "It's for the good of the nation..."
 KREST.21.b:0 "Never, Estonia will be a democratic nation!"

 KREST.25.t:0 "Opposition Denounces Sirk"
 KREST.25.d:0 "In the wake of Artur Sirk's decision to keep the Omakaitse separate from the military, along with proposing a referendum to make him essentially a dictator for life, the democratic opposition has denounced Sirk and the Vapsid Movement. Citing their dangerous and autocratic policies as proof that they would destroy the Fatherland, Juri Uluots has called for all true blooded Estonians to resist this referendum."
 KREST.25.a:0 "Nothing is ever easy."

 KREST.26.t:0 "A Meeting of Giants"
 KREST.26.d:0 "In the wake of Sirk's calls for a referendum, the forces arrayed behind Juri Uluots and his Isamaaliit have decided to meet with those of Jaan Tõnisson and his National Front. While the Isamaaliit are more authoritarian and favor a strong President, they are still a democratic party and the National Front would be willing to cooperate with them in exchange for some concessions. Amongst these would be that, while Tõnisson will allow an Uluots Presidency and a corporate upper house to the legislature, the lower house is to be democratic. Tõnisson has also demanded that, when the time comes, they be allowed to negotiate with Riga rather than be forced to fight them. If Uluots accepts this compromise, then the National Front will fully back what some are calling a coup attempt against Sirk's referendum."
 KREST.26.a:0 "Contact General Laidoner, we have a deal."
 KREST.26.b:0 "These demands are unacceptable!"

 KREST.27.t:0 "Artur Sirk Flees!"
 KREST.27.d:0 "In a shocking move, military forces led by General Johan Laidoner entered the capital with the express purpose of arresting Artur Sirk and the leaders of the Vapsid movement. At the same time, the delegates of the National Front and Patriotic League dismissed the referendum and instead held a vote to elect Jüri Uluots as the new President of Estonia, while Jaan Tõnisson and his National Front took control of the lower house. The forces under General Laidoner were effective in securing control of the city and arresting the leaders of the Vapsid movement, but Artur Sirk himself escaped."
 KREST.27.a:0 "Let him run like the coward he is."

 KREST.28.t:0 "Failed Military Coup"
 KREST.28.d:0 "Artur Sirk and the Vapsid Movement have secured the security and freedom of the Estonian Fatherland from the forces of corrupt kleptocrats. On the morning of the results of the referendum, military forces under General Laidoner attempted a coup d'etat with the help of the Patriotic League. However, they were not able to secure control of the capital when forces and delegates loyal to the National Front refused to assist in the coup. General Laidoner was promptly arrested along with his co-conspirator Juri Uluots and the Patriotic League, while Jaan Tõnisson and his National Front were also implicated in the coup attempt and promptly arrested when word of secret meetings and negotiations between them was leaked to the press. With the opposition now in chains due to their illegal and undemocratic actions, the referendum proceeded at pace and passed without issue, placing Artur Sirk and the Vapsids securely in power."
 KREST.28.a:0 "The democratic form of governance is insufficient to protect the Fatherland."

 KREST.29.t:0 "Artur Sirk Defenestrated"
 KREST.29.d:0 "News coming out of Finland seems to indicate that Artur Sirk, the former leader of Estonia and of the Vapsid Movement, has been found dead. Eyewitness reports indicate that at 11:37am on Sunday, Artur Sirk was thrown out the 5th floor of the hotel he was residing in. It's not exactly known why he was thrown through the window, as local police are still investigating, but it being a suicide has been ruled out."
 KREST.29.a:0 "Goodbye, Mr. Sirk."

 KREST.30.t:0 "Provisional Government Votes Down Referendum"
 KREST.30.d:0 "The Provisional Government under Sirk refused to support calls for a referendum that would install Sirk as a dictator for life, instead calling for a democratic constitution to be formed. While this move was not foreseen, Sirk is adamant in attempting to create his autocratic state, while democratic forces aligned with the PER, the National Front, have become incensed by this blatant attempt at subverting Estonian democracy."
 KREST.30.a:0 "Outrageous!"

 KREST.31.t:0 "Patriotic League Supports the National Front"
 KREST.31.d:0 "In light of recent events, Uluots and the Patriotic League have declared their support for the National Front, citing the need to oppose Sirk by any means necessary. While more militant than the PER, they're at least willing to back the protests sponsored by the National Front. Though they haven't made any demands for now, we can't expect that to hold forever, especially if the National Front takes power."
 KREST.31.a:0 "Better together than divided."

 KREST.32.t:0 "Criticism From Abroad and Within"
 KREST.32.d:0 "The discord in Estonia has caught the attention of not just local media, but also foreign broadcasts as commentators across Europe are reporting on the failed referendum and the seemingly looming Sirk dictatorship. Reporters from Germany, Finland, Sweden, and Lithuania have been making statements denouncing the Sirk takeover attempt, and supporting the formation of a moderate and democratic regime under Tõnisson. While this has certainly provoked some Estonians to support the National Front, others are still cautious and waiting to see what happens."
 KREST.32.a:0 "I never thought I'd thank the liberal media."

 KREST.33.t:0 "Tõnisson Demands Sirk Resigns"
 KREST.33.d:0 "With everything coming to a head, Jaan Tõnisson along with Jüri Uluots and their supporters have submitted an open letter demanding the immediate resignation of Artur Sirk. They are demanding that he disband the Vapsid movement, resign his position as provisional President, and turn over civil control to the PER so that a democratic constitution can be formulated. Artur Sirk has demonstrated resistance stating that Estonia requires a strong leader and an even stronger hand to guide it towards prosperity and preserve its independence from German and Russian aggression. Of course, Tõnisson has said that is foolish and negotiations with the Germans in Riga would save Estonia from war..."
 KREST.33.a:0 "It is time for the Vaps Movement to end."
 KREST.33.b:0 "No, I don't think I will."

 KREST.34.t:0 "Sirk Resigns His Position"
 KREST.34.d:0 "In the wake of the protests across the nation, pressure from media both domestic and foreign, and popular support in government against him, Sirk has opted to resign from his position and hand authority over to the National Front coalition led by Jaan Tõnisson. With his resignation, the National Front will begin the process of establishing a democratic constitution based around parliamentarianism, the abolition of the Presidency, and the creation of institutions to safeguard and educate Estonian citizens on the democratic processes of governance. Sirk in the meanwhile has fled the nation in disgrace."
 KREST.34.a:0 "I love democracy."

 KREST.35.t:0 "Sirk Declares Himself President for Life"
 KREST.35.d:0 "The National Front and its allies bet hard that the protests and immense pressure on Sirk would force him to resign, and they lost it all. Sirk instead hardened his resolve and the resolve of his followers, leading many of the protesters to wonder why they were out there. Biding his time, the protests lost steam and the media's attention began to waver, allowing Sirk to consolidate his hold on government and pass several resolutions cracking down on the National Front along with arresting Uluots and Tõnisson for sedition. With their leadership in chains and their morale shattered, the PER are no more."
 KREST.35.a:0 "So this is how Liberty Dies - with thunderous applause."

 KREST.36.t:0 "Estonia seeks to join Mitteleuropa"
 KREST.36.d:0 "In what comes as a shock to most in Berlin is the news that Estonia, who had liberated themselves from the hold of the United Baltic Duchy, are now asking to join Mitteleuropa. They are seeking to rekindle ties with Germany and to form a bulwark against the Russian menace, but should we accept their request?"
 KREST.36.a:0 "Think of the oil..."
 KREST.36.b:0 "Nein! That is German Lebensraum!"

 KREST.37.t:0 "Estonia Joins Mitteleuropa"
 KREST.37.d:0 "Citing the need for closer collaboration and mutual economic ties, Germany has agreed to include Estonia in Mitteleuropa. Falling under the German sphere of influence will no doubt help in protecting the safety and security of the Estonian people from Russian revanchism."
 KREST.37.a:0 "Very good."

 KREST.38.t:0 "Estonia Refused Membership in Mitteleuropa"
 KREST.38.d:0 "Our offer to join Mitteleuropa has been refused by Germany. The German delegate made several intolerable and obscene demands that would have seen Estonia essentially restored to the Duchy rather than being truly independent. We could not tolerate such demands and as such, Germany has refused to grant us access to their markets."
 KREST.38.a:0 "Well, this isn't good."

 KREST.39.t:0 "Trade with Estonia?"
 KREST.39.d:0 "The Estonians have approached us with an offer to trade goods and services, they claim that opening up free trade between our two nations would only prove beneficial to us. Their economy is very small compared to ours, but they also possess vast sources of shale oil which we could help fund and thus secure ourselves a more stable source of fuel."
 KREST.39.a:0 "We would be more than happy to trade."
 KREST.39.b:0 "We will decline your offer."

 KREST.40.t:0 "Russia Agrees to Trade"
 KREST.40.d:0 "The Russians have agreed to trade with us."
 KREST.40.a:0 "Good."

 KREST.41.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Trade"
 KREST.41.d:0 "The Russians have refused to trade with us."
 KREST.41.a:0 "Bad."

 KREST.42.t:0 "The Question of the Unions"
 KREST.42.d:0 "While we no longer have to contend for influence over the unions with the Vaps movement, we do not fully control the vast majority of them. Instead, many of them have liberal or even outright socialist leanings that will make cooperation and collaboration difficult. We could make concessions  towards them, gaining their favors and netting us greater support, or we could remove many of their leaders through surreptitious means. While this would be more effective in bringing them directly under our control, it would leave many of their followers questioning if our rule is legitimate."
 KREST.42.a:0 "Give the unions autonomy."
 KREST.42.b:0 "Directly controlling the unions would be better."

 KREST.43.t:0 "Dealing with the Plutocrats"
 KREST.43.d:0 "The Bourgeoisie control the vast majority of the wealth and resources of Estonia and if we are going to conduct our programs of mass industrialization and mechanization we will need access to them. It's not a question of if we must deal with them, but rather a question of how we will deal with them. Their immense power and wealth needs to be ours, and it shall be ours. Already, the Upper House is composed of allied corporatists and business leaders associated with us so it would be a simple manner to extend an olive branch towards the rest of the plutocracy in the nation to join us for special dispensation. The alternative though would be to use the extensive power of the State at our disposal to threaten and persuade these bourgeois pseudo-aristocrats into supporting our endeavors."
 KREST.43.a:0 "Give them seats in the Upper House."
 KREST.43.b:0 "Everything they have shall serve the State."

 KREST.44.t:0 "Reformation of the Bureaucracy"
 KREST.44.d:0 "In order to more efficiently pass our reforms and execute our programs, we will need to cut down any and all barriers to our regime. By placing new bureaucratic administrations under the direction of the Lower House, we can better focus on our tasks and reforms while endearing ourselves towards the opposition, however we can also directly appoint bureaucrats loyal to us and bypass the Lower House altogether. While this would make the government more efficient and save on spending, we would be alienating the democratic opposition."
 KREST.44.a:0 "Place it under the Lower House."
 KREST.44.b:0 "Appoint loyal administrators."

 KREST.45.t1:0 "Lower House Secures Power"
 KREST.45.t2:0 "Isamaaliit Narrowly Secures Power"
 KREST.45.t3:0 "Isamaaliit Secures Supreme Power"
 KREST.45.d1:0 "With the Isamaaliit government unable to effectively secure the support of the unions, the businesses, or even the bureaucracy itself the people have lost faith in their government. With this turn of events, the democratic Lower House led by the democratic opposition have moved to dissolve the Upper Senate and remove the Isamaaliit from power."
 KREST.45.d2:0 "The Isamaaliit government has managed to secure enough support from the unions, bourgeoisie, and the bureaucracy to be able to persuade the people of Estonia to support their platform of reforms and industrial modernizations. While the Lower House retains a sizeable proportion of influence and power in the government, the Isamaaliit dominance has been retained."
 KREST.45.d3:0 "Over the past few months the Isamaaliit government has managed to secure the support of the unions, businesses, and the bureaucracy well beyond any expectations. Through bold political manoeuvring and machinations, with some even accusing the Isamaaliit of outright underhanded and possibly even illegal actions, Isamaaliit have a complete plurality of control over the government, businesses, and the popular vote."
 KREST.45.a:0 "This is the end of the Isamaaliit government."
 KREST.45.b:0 "This was a costly victory."
 KREST.45.c:0 "We have only just begun."

 KREST.46.t:0 "Status of the Executive"
 KREST.46.d:0 "Article V of the Estonian Constitution:\n\n "The Government consists of the State Elder (Riigiwanem) and Ministers. The number of the latter, their office, and detailed order of business are to be established by special law. The State Elder represents the Estonian Republic, leads and unifies the activities of the Republican Government, presides over the meetings of the Government, and is authorised to interpellate any particular Minister.  The State Head and Ministers can be brought to trial for the usual delinquencies on the basis of the respective decisions of the State Assembly only. The examination is within the jurisdiction of the State Court." As the delegates approve the article, one question remains? How will the State Elder be chosen, through the Riigikogu or through the will of the people?"
 KREST.46.a:0 "The State Elder shall be elected by the Riigikogu."
 KREST.46.b:0 "The State Elder shall be elected by the popular vote."

 KREST.47.t:0 "Status of the Supreme Court"
 KREST.47.d:0 "Article VI of the Estonian Constitution:\n\n "The administration of justice in Estonia is exercised in the Courts of Justice, which are independent in their activities. The supreme judicial power in Estonia is exercised by the State Court of Justice, formed of State Judges elected by the State Assembly." As the delegates express their approval for the creation of an Estonian Supreme Court, a question remains. Should the appointments to the Supreme Court be determined by the will of the Estonian People, or should the State Elder be able to appoint whom he trusts?"
 KREST.47.a:0 "The Supreme Court shall be approved by the Riigikogu."
 KREST.47.b:0 "The Supreme Court shall be approved by the State Elder."

 KREST.48.t:0 "Status of the Riigikogu"
 KREST.48.d:0 "Article VII of the Estonian Constitution:\n\n "The Riigikogu consists of 100 members elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage on the principle of proportional representation. The State Assembly has the right to augment the number of its members. The law established in regard to this will come into force at the next elections of the State Assembly. The electoral law of the State Assembly will be passed as a special law. The State Assembly passes laws, fixes the budget, the State revenue and expenditure, and decides about loans and other matters on the basis of the Constitution." As the delegates finalize the Constitution, the question of representation has emerged. How can the people choose their representatives in a way that is fair and represents their true interests?"
 KREST.48.a:0 "Representatives shall be determined first past the post voting."
 KREST.48.b:0 "Representatives shall be determined through proportional voting."

 KREST.49.t:0 "The First General Election"
 KREST.49.d1:0 "The polls are closed, and the results are in regarding the first free election in the history of the Estonian Republic!

 KREST.49.c:0 "Strandman wins a surprise victory!"
 KREST.49.d:0 "August Rei carries the day!"

 KREST.83.t:0 "Estonia Wishes to Join Us"
 KREST.83.d:0 "The newly established Estonian republic has reached out to us, seeking to make amends despite a past of occupation under our rule - in exchange for recognition of their independence and a military alliance, they will pledge their army and resources to our side, and even offer trade contracts."
 KREST.83.a:0 "Let them in."
 KREST.83.b:0 "How about no."

 KREST.84.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
 KREST.84.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our offer to join their faction, leaving us alone in the increasingly fickle geopolitical scene of Europe once again."

 KREST.88.t:0 "Estonia Wants to Join the Federation"
 KREST.88.d:0 "The Estonian government has been watching the development of our union of Nordic nations with keen interest. Today we have received their formal application to join the federation as a constituent state."
 KREST.88.a:0 "Another Nordic nation joins the herd!"
 KREST.88.b:0 "Eesti cannot into Nordic."

 KREST.89.t:0 "Our Application Was Rejected!"
 KREST.89.d:0 "We have received word from Göteborg that our application to join the Nordic Federation has been rejected. It appears that the member states have rejected letting in our nation on the grounds that we are not of Germanic culture like them."
 KREST.89.a:0 "My country is dead! My game has ended!"

 KREST.90.t:0 "Hidden Event"
 KREST.90.d:0 "Hidden event to have PatAuts stay neutral 50% of the time, and all paths to stay neutral if set to by the game rules.\n\nThe flags added by the neutrality option mean that the decisions to join factions don't appear, and AI Russia won't ask Estonia to join their faction."

 KREST.90.b:0 "Always stay neutral."

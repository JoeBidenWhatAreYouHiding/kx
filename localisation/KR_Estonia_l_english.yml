### Leaders ###

Should he remain in power after the war, there may not be hope for democracy in Estonia..."

### Events ###
 KREST.1.t:0 "The Remnant Returns"
 KREST.1.d:0 "Both the Latvians and the Estonians cheered for the start of the Weltkrieg and supported the Russian war effort, believing that a display of patriotism would grant them autonomous status - and for Estonia, it appeared as if the gamble paid off. Estonia was granted national autonomy by the Russians after the February Revolution and elected its first government, the Maapaev - however, its time was short, as the outbreak of the October Revolution and the German invasion forced it to go underground. Before doing so, however, on February 24th, declared the independence of the Republic of Estonia and formed the Estonian Provisional Government.\n\nAs the German occupation turned permanent, the Estonian population increasingly turned towards resistance, often supported by the Bolsheviks next door - guerrilla warfare and even open fighting broke out between German occupation forces and the Omakaitse volunteers, until eventually, the Provisional Government was forced to flee, leaving the United Baltic Duchy behind and arriving to Scandinavian shores.\n\nDilapidated for a decade, it gained a new lease of life in 1930, when an Estonian National Congress was held in Petrograd and elected a new government in exile - headed by a veteran of the War of Independence and a talented speaker, Artur Sirk. Six years later, the United Baltic Duchy has fallen, and Estonian partisans welcome the return of their government in exile - however, not all is calm in Tallinn, as Sirk is an increasingly authoritarian leader and democracy in Estonia may flicker and die if he remains in charge..."
 KREST.1.a:0 "Estonia shall endure!"

 KREST.5.t:0 "Baltic Germans Request Schools"
 KREST.5.d:0 "A small group of Baltic Germans have request to Sirk's government representives to be allowed to open schools with the language of instruction to be German opposed to Estonian. They do stress though that Estonian will be taught within these schools and are more then happy to submit their curriculum for vetting.\n\nThis has been seen as an option for Sirk and his government to take the higher ground over their former masters, but there are those in the government who can not turn the other cheek, and rather take an eye."
 KREST.5.a:0 "Let us appease them."
 KREST.5.b:0 "Only Estonian language is permitted in Estonia." 

 KREST.15.t:0 "The Decree of Tallinn"
 KREST.15.d:0 "In an annoucement, Sirk decreed that the Omakaitse will answer to his office and not that of the Army. This has caused a public uproar, as many see this as another step taken by Sirk to become a Dictator of Estonia and that Sirk seeks to merely maintain his rule over Estonia. Both Uluots and Tõnisson have criticised Sirk stating that while most Estonians were fighting for their freedom, Sirk had fled to Finland and thus only barely participated in the national restoration. In response, Sirk blasted both Uluots and Tõnisson for seeking to divide the country and stated that both were merely attempting to sell Estonia to foreign powers. Either way, demands for a constitution are mounting with Sirk starting to find his position untenable" 
 KREST.15.a:0 "Well, straight into the fire it is."

 KREST.21.t:0 "Sirk Makes His Move"
 KREST.21.d:0 "With mounting demands on Sirk and the provisional government to allow a vote on a referendum for a constitution; Sirk, in a move to consolidate his powerbase, has formed the Eesti Vabadussõjalaste Liit, vabadussõjalased (Union of Participants in the Estonian War of Independence) or Vaps party. Now a "legitimate" party, Sirk has maneuvered himself into a position where he can dictate "terms" to the provisional government.\n\nThe terms highlight the creation of the office of President of Estonia, with legislative and executive powers, who would serve as the Head of State and Guide of the Nation, and approve himself Chairman of the Estonian National Committee, as the first President under this law. With the newly formed Vaps paramilitary guarding the Riigikogu to ensure that no "external" interruptions can occur."
 KREST.21.a:0 "It's for the good of the nation..."
 KREST.21.b:0 "Never, Estonia will be a democratic nation!"

 KREST.25.t:0 "Opposition Denounces Sirk"
 KREST.25.d:0 "In the wake of Artur Sirk's decision to keep the Omakaitse separate from the military, along with proposing a referendum to make him essentially a dictator for life, the democratic opposition has denounced Sirk and the Vapsid Movement. Citing their dangerous and autocratic policies as proof that they would destroy the Fatherland, Juri Uluots has called for all true blooded Estonians to resist this referendum."
 KREST.25.a:0 "Nothing is ever easy."

 KREST.26.t:0 "A Meeting of Giants"
 KREST.26.d:0 "In the wake of Sirk's calls for a referendum, the forces arrayed behind Juri Uluots and his Isamaaliit have decided to meet with those of Jaan Tõnisson and his National Front. While the Isamaaliit are more authoritarian and favor a strong President, they are still a democratic party and the National Front would be willing to cooperate with them in exchange for some concessions. Amongst these would be that, while Tõnisson will allow an Uluots Presidency and a corporate upper house to the legislature, the lower house is to be democratic. Tõnisson has also demanded that, when the time comes, they be allowed to negotiate with Riga rather than be forced to fight them. If Uluots accepts this compromise, then the National Front will fully back what some are calling a coup attempt against Sirk's referendum."
 KREST.26.a:0 "Contact General Laidoner, we have a deal."
 KREST.26.b:0 "These demands are unacceptable!"

 KREST.27.t:0 "Artur Sirk Flees!"
 KREST.27.d:0 "In a shocking move, military forces led by General Johan Laidoner entered the capital with the express purpose of arresting Artur Sirk and the leaders of the Vapsid movement. At the same time, the delegates of the National Front and Patriotic League dismissed the referendum and instead held a vote to elect Jüri Uluots as the new President of Estonia, while Jaan Tõnisson and his National Front took control of the lower house. The forces under General Laidoner were effective in securing control of the city and arresting the leaders of the Vapsid movement, but Artur Sirk himself escaped."
 KREST.27.a:0 "Let him run like the coward he is."

 KREST.28.t:0 "Failed Military Coup"
 KREST.28.d:0 "Artur Sirk and the Vapsid Movement have secured the security and freedom of the Estonian Fatherland from the forces of corrupt kelptocrats. On the morning of the results of the referendum, military forces under General Laidoner attempted a coup d'etat with the help of the Patriotic League. However, they were not able to secure control of the capital when forces and delegates loyal to the National Front refused to assist in the coup. General Laidoner was promptly arrested along with his co-conspirator Juri Uluots and the Patriotic League, while Jaan Tõnisson and his National Front were also implicated in the coup attempt and promptly arrested when word of secret meetings and negotiations between them was leaked to the press. With the opposition now in chains due to their illegal and undemocratic actions, the referendum proceeded at pace and passed without issue, placing Artur Sirk and the Vapsids securely in power."
 KREST.28.a:0 "The democratic form of governance is insufficient to protect the Fatherland."

 KREST.29.t:0 "Artur Sirk Defenestrated"
 KREST.29.d:0 "News coming out of Finland seems to indicate that Artur Sirk, the former leader of Estonia and of the Vapsid Movement, has been found dead. Eyewitness reports indicate that at 11:37am on Sunday, Artur Sirk was thrown out the 5th floor of the hotel he was residing in. It's not exactly known why he was thrown through the window, as local police are still investigating, but it being a suicide has been ruled out."
 KREST.29.a:0 "Goodbye, Mr. Sirk."

 KREST.30.t:0 "Provisional Government Votes Down Referendum"
 KREST.30.d:0 "The Provisional Government under Sirk refused to support calls for a referendum that would install Sirk as a dictator for life, instead calling for a democratic constitution to be formed. While this move was not foreseen, Sirk is adamant in attempting to create his autocratic state, while democratic forces aligned with the PER, the National Front, have become incensed by this blatant attempt at subverting Estonian democracy."
 KREST.30.a:0 "Outrageous!"

 KREST.31.t:0 "Patriotic League Supports the National Front"
 KREST.31.d:0 "In light of recent events, Uluots and the Patriotic League have declared their support for the National Front, citing the need to oppose Sirk by any means necessary. While more militant than the PER, they're at least willing to back the protests sponsered by the National Front. Though they haven't made any demands for now, we can't expect that to hold forever, especially if the National Front takes power."
 KREST.31.a:0 "Better together than divided."

 KREST.32.t:0 "Criticism From Abroad and Within"
 KREST.32.d:0 "The discord in Estonia has caught the attention of not just local media, but also foreign broadcasts as commentators across Europe are reporting on the failed referendum and the seemingly looming Sirk dictatorship. Reporters from Germany, Finland, Sweden, and Lithuania have been making statements denouncing the Sirk takeover attempt, and supporting the formation of a moderate and democratic regime under Tõnisson. While this has certainly provoked some Estonians to support the National Front, others are still cautious and waiting to see what happens."
 KREST.32.a:0 "I never thought I'd thank the liberal media."

 KREST.33.t:0 "Tõnisson Demands Sirk Resigns"
 KREST.33.d:0 "With everything coming to a head, Jaan Tõnisson along with Jüri Uluots and their supporters have submitted an open letter demanding the immediate resignation of Artur Sirk. They are demanding that he disband the Vapsid movement, resign his position as provisional President, and turn over civil control to the PER so that a democratic constitution can be formulated. Artur Sirk has demonstrated resistance stating that Estonia requires a strong leader and an even stronger hand to guide it towards prosperity and preserve its independence from German and Russian aggression. Of course, Tõnisson has said that is foolish and negotiations with the Germans in Riga would save Estonia from war..."
 KREST.33.a:0 "It is time for the Vaps Movement to end."
 KREST.33.b:0 "No, I don't think I will."

 KREST.34.t:0 "Sirk Resigns His Position"
 KREST.34.d:0 "In the wake of the protests across the nation, pressure from media both domestic and foreign, and popular support in government against him, Sirk has opted to resign from his position and hand authority over to the National Front coalition led by Jaan Tõnisson. With his resignation, the National Front will begin the process of establishing a democratic constitution based around parliamentarianism, the abolition of the Presidency, and the creation of instutition to safeguard and educate Estonian citizens on the democratic processes of governance. Sirk in the meanwhile has fled the nation in disgrace."
 KREST.34.a:0 "I love democracy."

 KREST.35.t:0 "Sirk Declares Himself President for Life"
 KREST.35.d:0 "The National Front and its allies bet hard that the protests and immense pressure on Sirk would force him to resign, and they lost it all. Sirk instead hardened his resolve and the resolve of his followers, leading to many of the protesters to wonder why they were out there. Biding his time, the protests lost steam and the media's attention began to waiver, allowing Sirk to consolidate his hold on government and pass several resolutions cracking down on the National Front along with arresting Uluots and Tõnisson for sedition. With their leadership in chains and their morale shattered, the PER are no more."
 KREST.35.a:0 "So this is how Liberty Dies - with thunderous applause."

 KREST.36.t:0 "Estonia seeks to join Mitteleuropa"
 KREST.36.d:0 "In what comes as a shock to most in Berlin is the news that Estonia, who had liberated themselves from the hold of the United Baltic Duchy, are now asking to join Mitteleuropa. They are seeking to rekindle ties with Germany and to form a bulwark against the Russian menace, but should we accept their request?"
 KREST.36.a:0 "Think of the oil..."
 KREST.36.b:0 "Nein! That is German lebensraum!"

 KREST.37.t:0 "Estonia Joins Mitteleuropa"
 KREST.37.d:0 "Citing the need for closer collaboration and mutual economic ties, Germany has agreed to include Estonia in Mitteleuropa. Falling under the German sphere of influence will no doubt help in protecting the safety and security of the Estonian people from Russian revanchism."
 KREST.37.a:0 "Very good."

 KREST.38.t:0 "Estonia Refused Membership in Mitteleuropa"
 KREST.38.d:0 "Our offer to join Mitteleuropa has been refused by Germany. The German delegate made several intolerable and obscene demands that would have seen Estonia essentially restored to the Duchy rather than being truly independent. We could not tolerate such demands and as such, Germany has refused to grant us access to their markets."
 KREST.38.a:0 "Well, this isn't good."

 KREST.39.t:0 "Trade with Estonia?"
 KREST.39.d:0 "The Estonians have approached us with an offer to trade goods and services, they claim that opening up free trade between our two nations would only prove beneficial to us. Their economy is very small compared to ours, but they also possess vast sources of shale oil which we could help fund and thus secure ourselves a more stable source of fuel."
 KREST.39.a:0 "We would be more than happy to trade."
 KREST.39.b:0 "We will decline your offer."

 KREST.40.t:0 "Russia Agrees to Trade"
 KREST.40.d:0 "The Russians have agreed to trade with us."
 KREST.40.a:0 "Good."

 KREST.41.t:0 "Russia Refuses to Trade"
 KREST.41.d:0 "The Russians have refused to trade with us."
 KREST.41.a:0 "Bad."

 KREST.42.t:0 "The Question of the Unions"
 KREST.42.d:0 "While we no longer have to contend for influence over the unions with the Vaps movement, we do not fully control the vast majority of them. Instead, many of them have liberal or even outright socialist leanings that will make cooperation and collaboration difficult. We could make concessions  towards them, gaining their favors and netting us greater support, or we could remove many of their leaders through surreptitious means. While this would be more effective in bringing them directly under our control, it would leave many of their followers questioning if our rule is legitimate."
 KREST.42.a:0 "Give the unions autonomy."
 KREST.42.b:0 "Directly controlling the unions would be better."

 KREST.43.t:0 "Dealing with the Plutocrats"
 KREST.43.d:0 "The Bourgeoisie control the vast majority of the wealth and resources of Estonia and if we are going to conduct our programs of mass industrialization and mechanization we will need access to them. It's not a question of if we must deal with them, but rather a question of how we will deal with them. Their immense power and wealth needs to be ours, and it shall be ours. Already, the Upper House is composed of allied corporatists and business leaders associated with us so it would be a simple manner to extend an olive branch towards the rest of the plutocracy in the nation to join us for special dispensation. The alternative though would be to use the extensive power of the State at our disposal to threaten and persuade these bourgeois pseudo-aristocrats into supporting our endeavors."
 KREST.43.a:0 "Give them seats in the Upper House."
 KREST.43.b:0 "Everything they have shall serve the State."

 KREST.44.t:0 "Reformation of the Bureaucracy"
 KREST.44.d:0 "In order to more efficiently pass our reforms and execute our programs, we will need to cut down any and all barriers to our regime. By placing new bureaucratic administrations under the direction of the Lower House, we can better focus on our tasks and reforms while endearing us towards the opposition, however we can also directly appoint bureaucrats loyal to us and bypass the Lower House altogether. While this would make the government more efficient and save on spending, we would be alienating the democratic opposition."
 KREST.44.a:0 "Place it under the Lower House."
 KREST.44.b:0 "Appoint loyal administrators."

 KREST.45.t1:0 "Lower House Secures Power"
 KREST.45.t2:0 "Isamaaliit Narrowly Secures Power"
 KREST.45.t3:0 "Isamaaliit Secures Supreme Power"
 KREST.45.d1:0 "With the Isamaaliit government unable to effectively secure the support of the unions, the businesses, or even the bureaucracy itself the people have lost faith in their government. With this turn of events, the democratic Lower House led by the democratic opposition have moved to dissolve the Upper Senate and remove the Isamaaliit from power."
 KREST.45.d2:0 "The Isamaaliit government has managed to secure enough support from the unions, bourgeoisie, and the bureaucracy to be able to persuade the people of Estonia to support their platform of reforms and industrial modernizations. While the Lower House retains a sizeable proportion of influence and power in the government, the Isamaaliit dominance has been retained."
 KREST.45.d3:0 "Over the past few months the Isamaaliit government has managed to secure the support of the unions, businesses, and the bureaucracy well beyond any expectations. Through bold political manoeuvring and machinations, with some even accusing the Isamaaliit of outright underhanded and possibly even illegal actions, Isamaaliit have a complete plurality of control over the government, businesses, and the popular vote."
 KREST.45.a:0 "This is the end of the Isamaaliit government."
 KREST.45.b:0 "This was a costly victory."
 KREST.45.c:0 "We have only just begun."

 KREST.46.t:0 "Status of the Executive"
 KREST.46.d:0 "Article V of the Estonian Constitution:\n\n "The Government consists of the State Elder (Riigiwanem) and Ministers. The number of the latter, their office, and detailed order of business are to be established by special law. The State Elder represents the Estonian Republic, leads and unifies the activities of the Republican Government, presides over the meetings of the Government, and is authorised to interpellate any particular Minister.  The State Head and Ministers can be brought to trial for the usual delinquencies on the basis of the respective decisions of the State Assembly only. The examination is within the jurisdiction of the State Court." As the delegates approve the article, one question remains? How will the State Elder be chosen, through the Riigikogu or through the will of the people?"
 KREST.46.a:0 "The State Elder shall be elected by the Riigikogu."
 KREST.46.b:0 "The State Elder shall be elected by the popular vote."

 KREST.47.t:0 "Status of the Supreme Court"
 KREST.47.d:0 "Article VI of the Estonian Constitution:\n\n "The administration of justice in Estonia is exercised in the Courts of Justice, which are independent in their activities. The supreme judicial power in Estonia is exercised by the State Court of Justice, formed of State Judges elected by the State Assembly." As the delegates express their approval for the creation of an Estonian Supreme Court, a question remains. Should the appointments to the Supreme Court be determined by the will of the Estonian People, or should the State Elder be able to appoint whom he trusts?"
 KREST.47.a:0 "The Supreme Court shall be approved by the Riigikogu."
 KREST.47.b:0 "The Supreme Court shall be approved by the State Elder."

 KREST.48.t:0 "Status of the Riigikogu"
 KREST.48.d:0 "Article VII of the Estonian Constitution:\n\n "The Riigikogu consists of 100 members elected by universal, equal, direct, and secret suffrage on the principle of proportional representation. The State Assembly has the right to augment the number of its members. The law established in regard to this will come into force at the next elections of the State Assembly. The electoral law of the State Assembly will be passed as a special law. The State Assembly passes laws, fixes the budget, the State revenue and expenditure, and decides about loans and other matters on the basis of the Constitution." As the delegates finalize the Constitution, the question of representation has emerged. How can the people choose their representatives in a way that is fair and represents their true interests?"
 KREST.48.a:0 "Representatives shall be determined through first past the post voting."
 KREST.48.b:0 "Representatives shall be determined through proportional voting."

 KREST.49.d1:0 "The polls are closed, and the results are in regarding the first free election in the history of the Estonian Republic! After days of tiring debate and discourse; the Eesti Rahvaerakond (Estonian People’s Party) have secured victory.\n\nRepresenting the Eesti Rahvaerakond is Jaan Tõnisson, an early fighter of the Estonian nationalist cause and a former alumni of the University of Tartu. Tõnisson fought tirelessly for Estonian independence during the Russian and German periods and has pledged to ensure that Estonian democracy transitions smoothly.

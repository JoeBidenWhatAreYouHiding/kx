### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_BAKR_SIDIQI_DESC:0 "Unlike many Kurds that joined the Ottoman Army's special Hamidiye units, Bakr Sidqi joined the general army alongside Arabs in after training in Istanbul. This slot allowed him to gain allies within the Ottoman command throughout the Weltkrieg. After many divisions of the Ottoman 4th Army were discharged in 1921, Sidqi managed the welfare of both Arab and Kurd troops in Kirkuk. Sidqi cultivated a loyalty in his men towards him above official orders, which only increased when military pensions were cut in 1922. When the Assyrian rebelled in 1925, Bakr personally led his troops through towns killing soldiers and civilians alike. It was this ruthless efficiency and the recent desertion of the Hamidiye that gave Bakr an informal rule as military governor of the Mosul Vilyet. Bakr's aim is to subordinate the Kurdish tribes under his military clique with the help of Arab and Turkish soldiers."
POLITICS_BARZANJI_DESC:0 "Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî is the leader and patriarch of the Berzincî clan living to the north of Mosul. Although Mehmûd himself is Sunni, his ancestor Musa Kazem of the Twelver Shia gives him authority over Kurds in Ardelan. Mehmûd has spent the last decade gathering arms and supporters from Iranian Kurdistan for revolt. This revolt is planned the same way prior Kurdish revolts have, and the incredible success has bolstered Kurdish claims that their dynasty is as legitimate as the Qajars or Osman."
POLITICS_BABA_SHEIKH_DESC:0 "Nominally a citizen of Iran, Haji Bana Sheikh was a religious leader for the Mahabad province of Persia before the Weltkrieg. His position as a Sheikh only recognised by the Kurds in Mahabad, in which he was considered a moderate Shia leader. When the Russians entered Kurdistan, he formed the Alliance of Islam Committee to seek cooperation with Iran and Azerbaijan. Haji cultivated an ally in General Reza Khan, which has finally paid dividends in Persia's triumph. Haji collaborated with the exiled Mistefa Barzanî in 1932 to establish the PDK, although they soon clashed over whether the party would support Iran's claims or not. Haji's pro Iran position and Reza's support led to a breakdown of this coalition in 1935, though both leaders stay in touch."
POLITICS_MIHEMED_DESC:0 "It was only after the failure of the Russian socialist revolution that Qazi Mihemed had realised his calling was socialism. Born into a rare Kurdish aristocracy and destined to be a poet, Qazi published his poems in Kurdi and Farsi, drawing the ire of the Qajars. His poems never reached the West, as the Khoyboun refused to publish his work. When internationalism finally came to Kurdistan, his works were found in the hands of socialists and he was found and uplifted from a jail in Sanandaj to realise the Kurdish destiny. Unlike most Levantine socialists, he rallies the Kurds in a united faith in Allah instead of nationality."
POLITICS_MUSTAFA_BARZANI_DESC:0 "A relative of the Sheikh Mehmûd Berzincî, Mistefa was only five when his family was imprisoned by the Ottoman military. Spending the majority of the Weltkrieg in hiding with his remaining family, Mistefa first became involved in his brother Ehmedê's milita in the 1920's. Ehmedê's militia attempted to steal arms from the Ottoman 4th Army in 1925, leading to Ehmedê's capture and execution. Mistefa fled with the remainder to Azerbaijan, where he joined Haji in establishing the PDK. Mistefa was disturbed to find the Haji had allies in the Persian military, and lobbied for the party to turn away from secularism and cooperation with Iran towards total autonomy and Barzanî tribal laws. Officially Mistefa and his allies are the leaders of the PDK."
POLITICS_SHEIKH_SAID_DESC:0 "Follwoing the end of the Ottoman Caliphate during the War in the Sands, many Kurds formerly belonging to the Hamidiye were discharged without pay. Those soldiers returned to find the Sidqi clique had slandered them as traitors. The Hamidiye moved into the Turkish side of Kurdistan, among the Zaza Kurds and Alevi. Among them was the Azadi Sheikh Said, an adept soldier who felt that the Ottomans were betrayed by secularists. His anti-secular position may have alienated the Iranian and Iraqi Kurds, but the Zazas rallied around him. Said reorganised the Hamidiye along with even Turkish volunteers into a fighting force to restore the Caliphate. Said himself was a Naqshbandi Sufi, who felt that Egypt had abandoned the path, and Salfis posed a threat to Sufi existence."
POLITICS_RIZA_DERSHIMI_DESC:0 "Karuman is a member of what had been a Ottoman loyalist family. The Bedirxans had ruled Bohtan for a century leading up to their independence activities. Compared to many other Kurdish nationalists, Kamuran had traveled to Britain prior to their revolution to establish a support group for Kurdish immigrants. His experience in Turkish law allowed him to arrange for people to leave Kurdistan for Britain until 1924. Following the revolution, Kamuran worked in the Commune of France developing new alphabet based on French to enable Kurds to spread their message internationally. This work was allowed despite his dealings with the former empires, until 1929 when his residency was revoked. This turned him against socialism, and his publications made out of Turkey reflected this. He is brought in as a competent economist and intellectual President of Kurdistan, in order to give dignity to the post."

### Ideas ###
KDR_Religious_Fevour:0 "Religious Fevour"
KDR_Religious_Fevour_desc:0 "Allahu Akbar! The heretic government in Konstantiniyye has proven that it cares little for the Islamic unity promoted by the office of the Caliph. It is now up to us, religious orders, tribesmen and devout followers of the Kurdish Sheikhs to take up arms and oust the traitors from their cushy seats in the capital."
KDR_Irregular_Army:0 "Hamidiye Army"
KDR_Irregular_Army_desc:0 "Based around the disbanded 'Hamidiye' regiments of the late Abdulhamid II, the Kurdish army suffers from an almost complete lack of discipline and unity as it relies far too much on a decentralised force led by Sheikhs and Aghas. Equipped with mostly pre-weltkrieg weapons, they furthermore suffer a serious material disadvantage compared to the much better equipped Turks."

### Events ###
kur.1.t:0 "A Fragile Rebellion"
kur.1.d:0 "When the Sheikhs and Aghas planted their banners in the ground before the Diyarbakır Ulu Camii (Great Mosque of Diyarbakır), many doubted their capabilities to wage an effective war on the regime of the Kemalists. Nonetheless many also doubted that these forces would ever combine their arms in the first place.\n\nWith railroads encroaching on the Kurdish domain, with Faith losing the status it deserves by the day and with Turkish intelectuals attempting to force their vision on our Grand Caliphate, many have seen the Light however with letters of support coming in from all across the Muslim world and volunteers, willing to fight for the Caliph, signing up in Diyarbakir. The cursed infidels of the capital will be shown the error of the ways very soon and the streets will run red with the blood of those opposing us. So let us go, restore the honour of our Caliph and save all Islam from this catastrophe!"
kur.1.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

kur.2.t:0 "Sulaymaniyah declares its independence"
kur.2.d:0 "Declared by the recently returned Sheikh Mahmut Barzinji, the city of Sulaymaniyah and the surrounding territory has decided to break with the Ottoman Empire and use the ruling chaos in the Mashriq to carve out a state of their own. This decisions comes a bit as a surprise for his former ally in [PER.GetName] who intended for him to destabilise the Porte but not declare a Kurdish state. Fearing support from their own Kurdish population for his cause, it remains currently unclear whether Iran will turn their guns on him before the situation could further deteriorate."
kur.2.a:0 "Damn Barzinji!"

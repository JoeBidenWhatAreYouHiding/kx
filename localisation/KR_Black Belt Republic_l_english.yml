Their leader Elijah Muhammad claims that NOI founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was God himself and that Elijah Muhammad is his appointed prophet on Earth, with Fard's sudden dissaparence leaving Elijah in charge. Outside the NOI Fard's dissaparence is a source of a multitude of conspiracy theories but nonetheless the NOI's paramilitary prowess, appeals to racial purity, guarantees of a minimum standard of living for members and promise to end all threats to Black Americans has made it one of the most powerful, and extreme, far-right organizations in Black America.§!"

POLITICS_HERMAN_BLOUTE_DESC:0 "Musical pioneer and funkadelic mixmaster, Herman Poole Blount has risen from humble beginnings as a musician and artist to become the very face of the Afro-Revivalist movement. The herald of Afrofuturism, the guide of our African-inspired renaissance, and the architect of our new cosmic future was born on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, and this ‘Sun Ra’ - as he likes to be called - has since become the facade of a radical coalition of varied Black nationalists seeking to control the destiny and identity of our republic. Blount, or ‘Sonny’ as his mother and sister used to call him, was born a musical prodigy, becoming a skilled pianist as a toddler and learning to compose and sight-read music before becoming a teenager, but most of his life’s details are kept intentionally-obscure by the man himself. First getting his start in professional music after joining his high school biology teacher’s band, Sun Ra would take off as a harmonious genius, briefly entering college before dropping out after his mysterious ‘Trip to Saturn.’ \n\nIn this ‘Trip,’ Blount claimed to have spiritually traveled to the distant planet of Saturn where he communed with strange beings that told him to drop out of college in order to use his musical talent and philosophy to bring peace to Earth, for a great disaster was on the horizon. It would not be long before the young Blount was proven right, for just a few months later, the Second American Civil War would begin, throwing the entire nation into chaos. \nAs the conflict exploded into bloodshed and the later BBR rose, Blount found himself drifting closer and closer to the radical end of New-Afrikan politics, and would find allies within the ABB, NOI, UNIA, and the Unity League. With the rise of the ‘Americanist’ forces in the nation and their crackdown on Afro-nationalism, Blount was uplifted to be the face of a new radical coalition of his varied friendly parties, all with one goal in common - to bring about a new African renaissance by toppling the Americanist regime. Utilized due to his immense popularity and due to his stance as the key figure of the Afro-revivalist movement, Blount is mostly a puppet to the powers behind him - a cultural pharaoh without a throne, but that may soon change..."
POLITICS_SUN_RA_DESC:0 "Solidifying the cult of personality around himself as well as the foundations of our new Afro-Cosmic identity, the man once called Herman Poole Blount is no more. Now, Le Sony’r Ra has begun to rise past the power and control of his political allies, and has revealed to the wider public of his ‘Trip to Saturn.’ Professing to the people that he is their savior from another world, Ra seeks to use his solidified alliances and political partners to bring about a new cultural revolution for his people. Fusing ideas and policies from across the political, artistic, and philosophical spectrums, Ra will bring a new cosmic golden age to this New Afrika, and though many in the nation still doubt his otherworldly origins, they have begun to believe he truly has the best interests for all mankind at heart. With newfound power and with his handlers waning in influence, Sun Ra has slowly begun to truly rule the nation himself, and by preaching peace and cooperation between our people above any petty struggle or ambition, he moves more and more of the masses to follow in his wake as he guides the nation to its new syncretic, celestial, Afro-centric future."
POLITICS_SUN_RA_GIGA_DESC:0 "Severing the puppet strings that once bound his mortal form, Cosmic Pharaoh Le Sony’r Ra - or just Sun Ra as the devoted masses praise him as - now lords over the Cosmic Realm of Aaru as its sole shepherd and all-powerful savior. Ra has shed the need for political allies as the masses praise their new divine leader’s name, supporting his mandate to rule with feverish adulation. This new saturnine field of reeds shall be the promised land of our reborn celestial race. This peace-preaching alien from Saturn has ensnared the hearts and minds of our people with his music, his poetry, his vision, and now the Aaruites prosper under this otherworldly deity. Bonded together by a new identity and culture that pulls from our Egyptian and West African roots, our origins from beyond the heavens, and our Afrofuturist destiny, the African diaspora shall be united and brought to our promised land out among the stars. We are the children of Saturn, the heirs to the Pharaohs, the heralds of the new African future, and the star children of destiny - all thanks to the all beloved and all eternal Sun Ra!"
POLITICS_WENTFORD_MATTHEW_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, Wentworth Aruthur Matthew claims to hail from Lagos, Nigeria. However, records indicate that he was in-fact born in the West Indies on the Island of St. Kitts - a fact he hides from most to uphold his greater ‘African’ image. As a young man, he and later his family moved to New York City where he eventually became a naturalized US citizen along with his wife Florence. Influenced by the teachings of Marcus Garvey and by the faith of New York City’s massive White Jewish population, Matthew would found the Commandment Keepers in 1919 in his new home of Harlem, starting his journey to bring honor and prosperity to the Black Hebrew Israelites. Thanking the White ‘Khazar’ Jews for safeguarding the faith for centuries, Rabbi Matthew claims that though Black Jews are the true Jews, that other Jews also deserve respect and protection to reward them for their unwavering piety. Attracted to ideas about the Lost Tribes, King Solomon, and the Beta Israelites of Ethiopia, Rabbi Matthew has combined Jewish faith with Africa and Ethiopian influences, claiming that the Black Hebrews are heirs to the Solomonic Dynasty of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and to the original Kingdom of Israel. Though other groups far more radical than the Commandment Keepers have tied themselves to Matthew’s movement, he himself is a moderate, and seeks to work together with our fellow Jews regardless of race or history. Together, we shall build a new Land of Milk and Honey."
POLITICS_WENTFORD_CHERRY_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, Wentworth Aruthur Matthew claims to hail from Lagos, Nigeria.

Influenced by the ‘Prophet’ Frank S. Cherry, Rabbi Matthew claims that the only good Jew is a Black one, and now follows Rabbi Cherry’s dream of igniting a race war to finally free our people and to finally cleanse this sinful planet. Under the command of Wentworth and with Frank Cherry whispering in his ear, the Black Hebrew Israelites shall finally have their revenge on the Khazar bastards and this sinful, decadent Western 'Civilization.’"
BBR_MK_SR_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Known to his closest allies, parishioners, family, and friends as ‘Daddy King,’ Michael King Sr. is one of the most widely respected men in the nation. Born in Stockbridge, Georgia in 1899, King was compelled to join the clergy at a young age after being inspired by local ministers all around him who stood up and protested for racial equality. Becoming close with Reverend A.D Williams at his local Ebenezer Baptist Church, the young King trained to be a pastor, dropping out of High School to attend Dillard University and shadowing Reverend Williams for years - and all the while King courted his new mentor’s daughter. Wanting to become an honest man and to do right by his mentor, his future wife, and God, King returned to high school to finish his formal education and then dove into his calling as a preacher, working all across Atlanta. By 1926, King was working on his ministerial degree at the Morehouse School of Religion, and on Thanksgiving Day of that year, he and his long-term sweetheart Alberta Christine Williams were married. Soon the couple would have three children in just four years, with Willie, Michael Jr., and Alfred being a great source of pride and joy for the honored pastor. In 1931, King’s mentor Reverend Williams passed away, and King rose to take his place as the leader of the Ebenezer Baptist Church amid a backdrop of rising tensions across America. Over the next few years he would visit Lutheran sites in Germany, join the NAACP as one of its leading figures, and would become acquainted with Father Divine and James Jones - of whom he would eventually ally and befriend. Now, leading the Peace Party after Father Divine was quietly urged to retire over his worsening mental state, Michael King Sr. hopes to guide our newly freed people away from the horrors of racism and opportunistic capitalism, and instead towards the all-loving and forgiving embrace of the Lord. With the Peace Party now behind him, many wonder if Daddy King will be the man to bring racial peace to America."
BBR_WEB_DUBOIS_POLITICS_DESC:0 "From an early day, William Edward Burghardt Du Bois would fight for equality, fight against intolerance, and go to any means for his beliefs. He grew up in a small integrated community in Massachusetts and attended university and eventually became a professor. Du Bois was one of the founders of the NCAAP, and one of the leaders of the Niagara Group, a group that opposed Booker Washington’s Atlanta Compromise. However, this would be just a page in his lifelong fight for equality, as throughout he fought against Lynchings, Jim Crow laws, and other discriminatory practices. He used his prominence as an author to spread his message to the wider world, with many regarding his work as cornerstones in the fight for Civil Rights all across America. Yet as the nation fell apart, the civil rights dilemma fell on deaf ears to the establishment. And with the outbreak of Civil War, it became clear that equality would not be came by peacefully. As the Black Belt uprising took hold over the South, Du Bois took hold over the new state, and will now call upon his countrymen to fight for equality, justice and their lives. "
BBR_FATHER_DIVINE_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Even to his supporters, Reverend M. J. Divine comes off as a strange man, a man who claimed to be God Himself. Yet, despite all of his various eccentricities his Peace Party is now in charge of the Black Belt Republic, were he seeks to unite the nation under tolerance and peace. Little is known about his early life, with people only being able to guess at his date and location of birth, as well as his birth name. Throughout his life he was sentenced to prison many times, committed to mental asylums, and declared as a madman, though most of these arrests were on baseless claims. Yet he and his followers persevered, following Father Divine and his unique church around America, even as the nation collapsed. His charisma and style of preaching turning his congregation from a disorganized and small group of Black Patrons to a massive interracial congregation. And along with James F. Jones, he founded the peace party, the party that eventually took over the Black Belt Republic. Now he will lead his countrymen to the future, no matter what it may bring. "
BBR_CHARLES_YOUNG_POLITICS_DESC:0 "Charles Young was born into slavery yet would go on to free many from oppression. Young attended an all-white high school and graduated at the top of his class, then became a teacher himself before he became a cadet at West Point. While at West point, Young was faced with a slough of discrimination from his peers, yet despite it all he persevered and graduated. He later served with Calvary troops and in various National Parks across America. He was also sent as a Military Attaché to Haiti and Liberia. Young was close to being the first Black Man promoted to Brigadier General, but many white troops did not want to be outranked by an African American. Due to this, president at the time Woodrow Wilson vetoed his promotion; throughout the following years white officers attempted to deny Young his promotion. Throughout the rest of his life Young was faced with discrimination, and when his brethren rose up against oppression, Young was quick to offer his services to the new Black Belt Republic. Now, Young is in charge of the young state and will guide it forward under Rooseveltian and Americanist principles. "
BBR_ELIJAH_MUHAMMAD_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Honourable Elijah Muhammad came from humble beginnings; he had little education, going to work in the factories after age 3. While living in Detroit, he attended rallies for various Black Nationalist organizations, including one with Wallace Fard Muhammad. He taught that African Americans could reclaim their culture and history through self determination, something that a young Elijah Muhammad agreed with considering his own struggles in the South. He became an ardent follower of Fard and his ideology. Eventually Fard turned leadership of the Detroit Chapter over to Muhammad, and had the organization renamed to the “Nation of Islam”. When Fard disappeared, Elijah Muhammad was quick to take leadership of the NOI. As America collapsed and the Black Revolt begun, Muhammad declared to his followers to rise up alongside them. And along with other Black Nationalists, he took over the young state. Now, he will ensure that Black America is God's land, and his people will never again be oppressed by the White Devil. "
BBR_MARCUS_GARVEY_POLITICS_DESC:0 "The Jamaican-born Marcus Garvey is one of the most fervent black nationalists around. The founder of UNIA has some reservations about the Black Belt Republic. But, seeing our willingness to pursue closer ties with Liberia, he has returned to claim the mantle of leadership for our young nation. A separatist at heart, Garvey hopes to create a Pan-African state. Even if he does accomplish this, he still hopes to retain the lands we have fought so hard for. He certainly will not give up the country to socialists, who he loathes more than almost anyone else. His ideology, fittingly termed "Garveyism", has caught on in the Black Belt Republic. Many of our citizens hope to migrate to Africa eventually, but this is a long term goal, and for now, there is still the issue of other American factions to contend with. "
POLITICS_DUSE_MUHAMMAD_DESC:0 "Duse Mohamad Ali is an Egyptian black nationalist who believes in the concept of a Pan-Africa. His mentor, George Wells Parker, has died and left his legacy to Ali, who promised to continue it. Their ideology of social nationalism has caught in the Black Belt Republic, and now Ali stands poised to make his long held dream come true. With the Hamitic League by his side, Ali will hold power for years to come, and one day, perhaps Africa will be free from outside control."

BBR_salvage_COR_fleet_decision_desc:0 "Late in our struggle for independence when our victory had been all but assured, the leaders of the Constitutional Navy ordered to scuttle their ships of the Carolina coast. Unfortunately for them and fortunately for us, the place they chose to do so was in very shallow waters and with some ingenuity we should be able to salvage many of these ships and get them back into working order to assist in our liberation of those across the sea."

### Ideas ###
BBR_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis, the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

BBR_black_monday:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

BBR_black_monday2:0 "The Great Depression"

However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

BBR_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
BBR_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."

BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country.

### Black Hebew Ideas ###

BBR_abrehamic_resestienec:0 "Fierce Abrahamic Resistance"
BBR_abrehamic_resestienec_desc:0 "Despite our pure faith and the truths that we profess, our fellow Abrahamics have put up resistance to our rule. Across our new holy land, Christians, Muslims, Jews of other creeds, heretics, and even atheists of all kinds all rage against our rightful mandate. With Yahweh on our side and with ferocity in our hearts, we shall push back against these misguided fools as we attempt to solidify our grasp over the Black Belt. We are the true disciples of Abraham, and we shall prove it through force."

BBR_abrehamic_resestienec_2:0 "Fading Abrahamic Resistance"
BBR_abrehamic_resestienec_2_desc:0 "With the successes of our militias and paramilitaries only continuing and with our numbers growing rapidly in recent months as more wise souls join we Chosen in the one true faith, we have begun to finally snuff out the bulk of the Abrahamic resistance against our new regime. We have marched against these heretical sinners in force, forcing their varied masses to cower before our pious splendor and shrivel back into the shadows they spawn from, finally uplifting our new holy land as we strive to grow more secure and prosperous. Though we still have many more cells of resistance to eradicate and many more heretical churches left to burn, our new Promised Land inches ever closer to prosperity, stability, and peace."

BBR_jew_nat:0 "Garveyite Nationalism"
BBR_jew_nat_desc:0 "Marcus Garvey is one of the greatest men of our era - a herald of the coming resurgence of Black pride and the birth of pan-Diaspora Afro-Nationalism, and a titan who has sworn to protect and uplift his fellow Negro. His rhetoric and view of our peoples’ future have come to form the basis of our racial and nationalistic views. Though Garvey may not be of our faith, he is still our brother, and we shall look to his image and uphold his ideas here in our new holy land."

BBR_true_child_of_god:0 "God's Only True Children"
BBR_true_child_of_god_desc:0 "We are the true Chosen - the only real and favored children of the Lord above. The Black Hebrew Israelites are His Chosen People, and our faith is the one, true faith. Other Jews outside our congregation are mere pretenders or heretics, and the lowly beasts that pray to other gods are most deluded of all. We will prove to them with our splendor, our pride, our piety, and our prosperity that we truly are His favored sons, for the only true Jew is a Black one."

BBR_prepared_for_final_battleidea:0 "Prepared For the Final Struggle"
BBR_prepared_for_final_battleidea_desc:0 "In the year 2000, Jesus shall return to Earth to start a race war in order to cleanse this world of heathens and heretics. This undeniable truth is professed by Rabbi Frank S. Cherry - Rabbi Matthew’s most favored ally - and by his word we began to prepare for this final struggle. However, our eager state has decided that in order to prepare for this eventuality, we must first take back the continental United States in order to secure our new holy land and to begin the final cleansing before the arrival of the Messiah, in order to both proof our piety and our commitment to His will. With this initial goal in mind, mass militarization programs were started in order to prepare for the end times, and now with the final factories opening and with our final regiments marching in step out of boot camp, it would seem that we are as ready as we'll ever be to take down the caustic, dying titan of decadence that lies before us. We march for Washtington and beyond to burn down the old order and to eradicate heretical anti-Jewry in America once and for all."

BBR_welcoming_da_jews:0 "A Haven for the Chosen"
BBR_welcoming_da_jews_desc:0 "With the Commandment Keepers standing strong with our fellow Jews across the diaspora, Rabbi Matthew has moved to open our lands to the wider Jewish world. We shall build a new Land of Milk and Honey here for all Sons of Jacob and all disciples of Solomon and Abraham, for that is what the Lord asks of us. We may be the true Israelites, but that does not mean we are the only ones - it is our duty as the best among them and as YHWH’s Chosen to serve as their shepherds, as their guides, and as their leaders, for these faithful have kept the faith alive and thriving in our absence. The entire Jewish diaspora shall be our brethren, and we will open our arms to all of them, despite their mixed and frequently antagonistic attitudes towards us. We will turn our cheek and forgive these misguided and wayward souls, for that is what the Chosen do."

BBR_jew_swaying:0 "Swaying Our Brothers in the Faith"
BBR_jew_swaying_desc:0 "Despite our open arms and position of peace and cooperation towards our fellow Hebrews, the wider Jewish world - of whom most are White or Tan as opposed to our Black - has largely ignored our calls for unity. Instead, most have ignored us or even spat in our direction, claiming we are mere pretenders bastardizing ‘their’ faith. We will show them - not through war or conflict, but through kindness and piety - that we truly are the heralds of Yahweh’s will, and that we truly know what is best for the wider Jewish people. Through diplomacy, agreeable trade, good-will missions, charity, and any other form of cooperation, we shall prove to these misinformed brethren that we truly just want what is best for our shared people. Only then shall we be able to enjoy our new Promised Land together."

BBR_funny_jews_with_gun:0 "The Fightin’ Hebrews"
BBR_funny_jews_with_gun_desc:0 "With proud paramilitaries run by sub-churches of the Commandment Keepers and by individual synagogues, with dutiful militias organized by our masses patrolling the streets, with a gun in the hand of every able-bodied man in the nation, and with our new factories churning out both the smog of progress and weapons of war, we have transformed our once-undefended and vulnerable people into a hive a zealots ready to defend our faith, our borders, and our Chosen people without hesitation or remorse. The ‘Fightin’ Hebrews’ as our foes have nicknamed us has become more than a moniker built out of hate - it has become a symbol adopted by our very people. Our new holy land was birthed and forged in a baptism of flame and blood during the Second American Civil War, and this hell is the only hell our people know or believe in. Always at the ready and ever-vigilant, ever-loyal, and ever-fierce, we true Israelites will protect this Land of Milk and Honey without falter. Our new Jerusalem shall never fall!"

BBR_halie_hassie_boi_idea:0 "A King for the Lost Tribe"
BBR_halie_hassie_boi_idea_desc:0 "We are the true descendents of King Solomon and God’s true Chosen. We have embraced the teachings of Rabbi Matthew and the late Arnold Josiah Ford, proclaiming our true heritage as sons of the Beta Israelites, members of the Lost Tribes, and as the heirs to the Solomonic dynasty started by Emperor Menelik I, son of King Solomon and Makeda, the Queen of Sheba. The proud, pious, and honorable Haile Selassie I is our rightful sovereign as the king of all true Jews and as the embodiment of God’s divinity on Earth. Whether he openly accepts this fate or not does not matter to our creed, for we know the truth. Selassie shall be the symbol of our nation and our heritage despite his refusal to come to our shores, and may his illustrious image unite all true Sons of Jacob and Solomon in perpetuity."


### Sun Ra Ideas ###
BBR_african_rebirth:0 "Rebirth of an African Identity"
BBR_african_rebirth_desc:0 "Herman Poole Blount is the face of the new African revivalist movement that has swept the Black Belt since the triumph of our radical coalition. Harkening to West African, Egyptian, and Afro-Carribbean traditions and history, this new cultural movement seeks to firmly ties the identity of the North American Negro to the identity of their African ancestors. Drawing much of its influence from Garveyite thought mixed with the ABB’s pharaonic views on our history, this new African identity shall form the basis of our new state as we seek to establish a new self for our people."

BBR_lefty_future:0 "Birth Pangs of Progressive Afrofuturism"
BBR_lefty_future_desc:0 "Our journey into Afrofuturism has only just begun, and with Sun Ra’s push to include all souls within this new cosmic-African identity, he has received a great deal of pushback and caused considerable unrest - especially within the more extreme wings of our national government. Our state was founded on ideas of Black independence, but now we find ourselves in bed with many of our former non-Black foes. Regardless of these growing pains, true progressive and open Afrofuturism shall come to embrace each and every soul in our new Aaru. Our citizens of all colors are just going to have to accept this altered destiny, for it is the will of Ra, and along the way his new allies shall ensure this new destiny is maintained."

BBR_lefty_future_2:0 "Progressive Afrofuturism's Triumph"
BBR_lefty_future_2_desc:0 "After an initial period of considerable pushback and resistance, Sun Ra has been able to sway most in the nation to accept his message that all souls that embrace our new identity shall reap the benefits of such - regardless of race or creed. Though we may not all be Black, we are all cosmic beings and children of Saturn merely trying to live life to the fullest while fully exploring our true selves. Each of our people are unique in their own way, and under our progressive Afrofuturist regime, each shall thrive in their own way as we keep the peace and maintain our prosperity. Only through peace and cooperation can we reach the stars."

BBR_reaction_future:0 "Towards Reactionary Afrofuturism"
BBR_reaction_future_desc:0 "Our journey into Afrofuturism has only just begun, but with Sun Ra’s decision to double-down on the nationalist and Black supremacist attitudes of the wider radical coalition, we have taken to this new journey rather quickly. Our nation was founded on the idea of Black independence, and our new culture shall come to personify that struggle as well. Though we still have much to do to fully cement this Afrocentric and Black supremacist identity, we are well on our way, and soon our new Cosmic Realm of Aaru shall come to embody the best of both our African heritage and our cosmic origins."

BBR_reaction_future_2:0 "Reign of Reactionary Afrofuturism"
BBR_reaction_future_2_desc:0 "With Sun Ra’s push for Black dominance resonating with the masses, our Black Belt has truly become a new Africa for our people. Black is best, and no state on Earth exemplifies this more than our Cosmic Realm, for every facet of our society from our economy to our very culture and identity are centered around the ideas of Garveyite-influenced Afrofuturist Negro Supremacism. All true children of Saturn recognize the truth that we Negroes are the pinnacle of life on this planet and among the stars, and now we have a state that matches that splendor."

BBR_music_and_stuff:0 "The Dawn of an Afrofuturist Artform"
BBR_music_and_stuff_desc:0 "With the Arkestra of Sun Ra as our guide, we have begun to experiment as a wider society - that is, to experiment with art. From music and composition to poetry and painting, all aspects of our cultural artforms shall be injected with the funk and genius of Sun Ra’s Afrofuturism, pulling from African and Diaspora influences as well as his own visions of Saturn and our altered destiny. With Sun Ra as our sonic shepherd, we shall dive into this new Afro-Future together to further cement our new identity."

BBR_music_and_stuff_2:0 "An Artistic Afrofuturist Culture"
BBR_music_and_stuff_2_desc:0 "As the heirs to the Pharaohs, the children of Saturn, the kin of Africa, and the heralds of the Afro-Future, our state has taken on many influences. Merging them together and expressing them in new forms of art and other outlets, we have created a syncretic culture that combines our African heritage with our Saturnine origins and our cosmic destiny. Art in all its forms has become one of the key pillars of our state alongside African revivalism and Black empowerment, as it guides our youth, forms the framework of this Cosmic Realm, and serves as the main tool of Sun Ra to both lead and control the nation. We have evolved art like we have evolved ourselves, and with this new artistic Afrofuturist identity supporting our people and our nation, we shall never falter as we progress towards destiny."

BBR_african_sun_ra:0 "Cosmic Pan-African Nationalism"
BBR_african_sun_ra_desc:0 "All humans come from Africa if you go back far enough, but before that, we came from Saturn! Pan-Africanism is in our blood, as well as the blood of all our cosmic brothers and sisters of this Earth. The color of the skin does not matter, for it is the soul inside and how it grooves and expresses itself that truly makes a difference. We shall embrace our African heritage and every aspect of the cultures we come from, incorporating them into our new identity and state of being, while also allowing all Cosmic Africans - whether they be White or Black or Tan in skin - to join us in this paradise."

BBR_blacks_only_idea:0 "A State for the Negroes Alone"
BBR_blacks_only_idea_desc:0 "Our new state here along the Black Belt has come to embrace all that embodies what it means to be African and Black. We are the true children of Saturn, and our Pan-African people are destined for greatness unlike any other civilization has ever seen before. We are the beginning of this species, and we can be its end, for we are the celestial Saturnine sons, and none other can aspire to even come close to our cosmic divinity. This realm shall be for our people alone, and to our people we Sun Ra will give paradise, and we shall let no others get in our way."

BBR_open_arms_to_black_people:0 "A Home for the Diaspora"
BBR_open_arms_to_black_people_desc:0 "To cement our Afrocentric and Pan-African leanings while also aiding our brothers and sisters of Saturn across the world, we have opened the borders of our new field of reeds to all children of Africa. All those who we have declared true African shall be allowed to enter our borders and take refuge here as we seek to build a new paradise under Sun Ra."

BBR_TO_SAT_idea:0 "§MTO SATURN!§!"
BBR_TO_SAT_idea_desc:0 "With the revelation that Sun Ra was in fact an alien from Saturn sent to liberate the true human race with his sonic genius and poetic art, our people were uplifted by this Cosmic Pharaoh. Now, Sun Ra will be our guide to our primeval and celestial homeland out among the stars. We will escape this war-torn and hateful Earth, and bring our people to paradise so that each can live how they choose to live and to the fullest, all under the glory of the all-knowing and all-seeing Sun Ra. Onwards to Saturn! Onwards to the Afro-Future!"

BBR_racial_expropriation:0 "Racial Expropriation"
BBR_racial_expropriation_desc:0 "While we can work with other national proletariat groups, it is clear that within its own land, the Black population needs to own the wealth that had been taken from them. It was stolen by the foriegn capitalist class, which has repressed Black labor within the nation. As such, non-Black members of the upper-middle and upper-classes will have their wealth repossesed by the state, which represents the Black Proletariat."

BBR_hamitic_league_of_the_world_desc:0 "The Hamitic League of the World is aware of a very simple fact: the Negro race is the greatest race the world has ever known. Further, Black civilization is far older than Whites have claimed. Its membership numbers must be expanded among both Black and mixed-race peoples. It needs funding to promote its views among the populace and overseas to promote our legitimacy, with the League becoming a predominant means of outreach to the black community both here and abroad."

BBR_children_of_the_sun_desc:0 "We are the descendents of great civilzations including Egypt, Greece, and Ethiopia, and yet this knowledge is supressed by the White Bourgeosie and their collaborators at every turn.

BBR_work_communes:0 "Work Communes"
BBR_work_communes_desc:0 "A means of organizing more unskilled and still unorganized members of the Black Nation so they may contribute to society and secure for themselves employment is challenging.

BBR_black_mercantilism_desc:0 "Due to the oppression of the Children of the Sun, we have been unable to build wealth in the same manner as others, but having our own mercantilism will solve this.

BBR_black_nobility_desc:0 "In taking back our rightful place, we must look to the past for inspiratation. A black nobility once existed that created much of civilization before its legacy was covered up. We will recreate the Black Nobility with titles to loyal party officials and the exceptional.

BBR_league_of_revolutionary_struggle:0 "The League of Revolutionary Struggle"
BBR_league_of_revolutionary_struggle_desc:0 "While our military is organized, we still need intelligence services and propaganda.

BBR_military_build_up:0 "Building Our Own Arms"
BBR_military_build_up_desc:0 "The naive would have us focus solely on civilian investments, but military industries are no less important.

BBR_rapid_nationalization:0 "Rapid Nationalization"
BBR_rapid_nationalization_desc:0 "The economy must come under the command of the government at once if we are to develop true socialism. As such, major industries will be nationalized and brought under the control of the government, capitalists be damned."

BBR_agrarian_revolution:0 "The Agrarian Revolution"

BBR_marxian_nationalism:0 "Marxian Nationalism"
BBR_marxian_nationalism_desc:0 "Most forms of 'Nationalism' are sadly reactionary, but it need not stay that way. Local cultural nationalisms can be respected as a tool of liberation, so long as class solidarity comes first, so administrations for different regions will be established."
BBR_total_liberation:0 "Total Liberation"
BBR_total_liberation_desc:0 "We've taken the reigns of the economy, but that does not mean the culture has changed enough.

BBR_rapid_industrialization:0 "Industrializing the Land"
BBR_rapid_industrialization_desc:0 "We must put industrialization of the nation first if we are to be a leading socialist economy. We should export our raw resources in return for capital goods from the Internationale, and have our planners place emphasis on producing new factories and nationalizing older ones for a true economy of scale."
BBR_left_military_police:0 "Jacobin Military Police"
BBR_left_military_police_desc:0 "Our military should be praised for the work it has done so far, but that does not mean reactionary influence is not present. A Jacobin Military Police will be geared towards monitoring for potential disloyalty within, and sometimes outside, the military. Further, they will handle military trials, increasing discipline and stability in the process."
BBR_the_southern_upsurge:0 "The Socialist Southern Upsurge"
BBR_the_southern_upsurge_desc:0 "The Party needs more support at once, and the reactionaries need to be culled.

BBR_a_party_with_a_state_desc:0 "While party membership has increased, it is time to finalize the party's control.

BBR_sp_centralists:0 "Socialist Party Centralists"
BBR_sp_centralists_desc:0 "The Socialist Party Centralist Faction has come to power under James Ford and his so-called 'Browderist-Fordist' faction. Supporting a centrally guided economy, strong leadersip, and limited reforms, the faction is considered the least ideological of the Vanguardists."
BBR_workers_market:0 "The Workers Market"
BBR_workers_market_desc:0 "While capitalist enterprises must be ended, the worker's market will be tolerated for the good of the nation. With price controls in place, workers and family businesses that do not grow too large will be allowed to sell their goods to one another while government control of large businesses will be mandatory."
BBR_working_the_bourgeosie:0 "Have the Bourgeosie Bend the Knee"
BBR_working_the_bourgeosie_desc:0 "Capitalist ownership must end, and so it will. But, members of the bourgeosie and middle-class do have experience in management and setting prices.

BBR_socialist_civic_identity:0 "Socialist Civic Identity"
BBR_socialist_civic_identity_desc:0 "Our civic identity must come from a shared sense of responsibility to the common good and socialism, not to race or other such nationalisms including the most unstable forms of class warfare. A socialist civic identity will promote loyalty to socialism and the state, around which anyone can be a citizen if they recognize this."
BBR_unite_the_left:0 "Corral the Left"
BBR_unite_the_left_desc:0 "The left is still sadly unstable, with some socialists attacking us for being too radical in our methods, while those on our left call us sellouts. Worse, the liberal left believe we were wrong to install a socialist government from the top down. We must pressure the left to conform to the SPA, rewarding loyalty and punishing deviation."
BBR_purge_radicals:0 "Purge Radicals"
BBR_purge_radicals_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts, the most radical communists still hold out against us, as do the remaining nationalist and NOI cells.

A short but efficient purge is in order to stabilize society and leave the SPA in command."
BBR_required_unionization:0 "Unionize Yesterday"
BBR_required_unionization_desc:0 "To not unionize is to simply undermine other members of the working class in a bid to appeal to capitalists. The Party will help, and pressure, all members of the working class to join our unions so that the working class may be better represented."

BBR_counter_reactionaries_desc:0 "While our nation was founded on progress, reactionaries sought to abuse the novelty of the country for their own ends.

BBR_radicalized_unions:0 "Radicalized Unions"
BBR_radicalized_unions_desc:0 "Not all unions seem willing to engage in revolutionary action, but that will change.

BBR_equality_of_wealth:0 "Equality of Wealth"
BBR_equality_of_wealth_desc:0 "Property ownership is still uneven, as is savings due to a still present non-capitalist upper-middle and even wealthy class. Wealth shall be redistributed for equity and only personal property, not private property, will be legally enforced. In return for their wealth, they will get some extra workers coupons in the future."
BBR_class_consciousness:0 "Southern Class Consciousness"
BBR_class_consciousness_desc:0 "In the South, the elite have used race consciousness to overcome the actual truth of class struggle. We will overcome this superstructure!

BBR_workers_coupons_desc:0 "Workers Coupons shall take the place of money, which was abused by capitalists to accumulate mass amounts of wealth and underpay workers.

BBR_red_militias:0 "Red Militia Justice"
BBR_red_militias_desc:0 "The Militias are a truly democratic means of organizing our internal, and external, security forces.

BBR_rubber_stamped_urbanization:0 "Rubber-Stamped Urbanization"
BBR_rubber_stamped_urbanization_desc:0 "The TUC being based from the bottom-up does not mean it cannot aid in central planning. The TUC will come to internal agreements on needed industrialization and urbanization, and hire certain unions to be tasked with it."
BBR_organize_tenant_farmers:0 "Organize Tenant Farmers"
BBR_organize_tenant_farmers_desc:0 "Tenant Farmers are the most abused workers in our economy. They will need to be better organized into a radicalized Southern Tenant Farmers Union if they are to be part of a larger solidarity-based economy and have their class consciousness raised."

BBR_intellectual_appeals_desc:0 "The Intellectuals in the Commune of France and other syndicalist nations have gotten along well with Black Intellectuals, and the two groups should work together to appeal to the remaining skeptics of the Black intellectual class to argue as to why our way forward is the future. Higher education will be a special target for this."
BBR_accelerate_integration:0 "Accelerate Integration"
BBR_accelerate_integration_desc:0 "It is time to no longer accept racial dynamics! Not only will segregation and race hatred be severly penalized, but quotes will be placed on state-influenced industries to encourage race-mixing. Meanwhile, we will make arguments on behalf of race integration."

BBR_approach_local_socialists:0 "Approach Local Socialists"
BBR_approach_local_socialists_desc:0 "While we do not see eye-to-eye on all issues, the socialist's influence among the working class is obvious, and we must credit their militias support of the nation. Thankfully, their moderate wing can be won over via negotiations with unions, increased wages, and lower working hours for workers."
BBR_approach_the_afp:0 "Working with the AFP"
BBR_approach_the_afp_desc:0 "Likely the most fervent supporters of our cause are the local AFP supporters and militias in the area, with our regional AFP being more unambiguously pro-Black than the national AFP. By encouraging party ties and providing rural support, we can cement our support among them and farmers."
BBR_crush_race_separatists:0 "Crush Race Extremists"
BBR_crush_race_separatists_desc:0 "Pockets of Race Nationalists still exist throughout the nation, namely the Klan, NDWL and ODP among whites and the NOI, UNIA and African Blood Brotherhood among blacks. By rooting out their most active supporters and shutting down their remaining operations we can stop those who would encourage race war amongst the American people."

BBR_deport_anarchists_desc:0 "The most extreme left radicals, namely the Fosterites under Haywood and Black Jacobins under Davis, are still causing problems in their outposts, plotting against our government and attacking perceived class traitors and capitalists.

BBR_american_recruitment_effort:0 "Mass Recruitment Effort"
BBR_american_recruitment_effort_desc:0 "We need soldiers now if we are going to hold our own against our newfound enemies.

BBR_integration_through_service:0 "Integration through Patriotism"
BBR_integration_through_service_desc:0 "Our army command is still reluctant to adopt full integration to not only the military, but the country, believing that race-relations are not strong enough. The American Union Bill will settle this as training will incorporate full integration and drill soldiers to put command over race, while our nation will see a patriotic campaign emphasizing our shared Americanism and propaganda."
BBR_american_traditions:0 "American Traditions"
BBR_american_traditions_desc:0 "While some in our nation associate America unequivocally with race hatred this is not true, as race-extremists attempted to destroy and betray the American Nation. By adopting American traditions, especially the flag, anthem, salutes and holidays, and speaking at length about our right as a continuation of America, we will cement a national identity."
BBR_fair_play:0 "Economic Fair Play"
BBR_fair_play_desc:0 "The issue is not, as the socialists view it, that Capitalism is inherently evil, but that it has come to be dominated by too few men without scruples. By passing anti-trust laws, further regulation of major companies to prevent price-gouging and inheritance, and progressive taxation, we can level the playing field for those attempting to compete in the marketplace."
BBR_paternal_economics:0 "For the Public Good"
BBR_paternal_economics_desc:0 "While leveling the playing field was helpful, it is not enough. We must go a stop further and provide minimum wage laws, a Federal Security commission for economic stability, and the nationalization of new federal lands and resources. This will accompany the subsidizing of promising consumer industries, education, and research. With that, we will provide jobs and goods for our people."

BBR_captain_at_the_helm_desc:0 "While it is important for a democratic outlet in the legislative branch to provide for the people, it's equally as important for a strong executive to provide stability, security and unity to their nation. General 'Captain' Young and his military clique will steer for a forward-thinking executive office that will see our nation the most prosperous in the world."
BBR_ally_long:0 "Union State Outreach"
BBR_ally_long_desc:0 "The American Union State is not perfect by any means but it is at least less hostile to us than syndicalists who view us as usurping black socialism and western powers desiring to occupy us. Perhaps we can work a deal with them to recognize our territory, and potential reintegration down the line?"

BBR_peace_party_desc:0 "Father Divine and James F. Jones' Peace Party has pulled through in the election, with their appeals to pacifism, tolerance and Christian morality appealing to even voters who view some of their specific tenants as unorthodox. The New Republic shall be united with the message of Peace!"
BBR_cash_only:0 "Cash Only"
BBR_cash_only_desc:0 "It is time to end the tyranny of pretend currency called 'credit' and the thrift associated with it.

Meanwhile we will give a tax break to community banks based on this model."
BBR_modesty_codes:0 "Modesty Codes"
BBR_modesty_codes_desc:0 "Many have given into vices such as alcoholism and cheating that destroy not only them but their families and society at large, something we are now in a position to legislate out of existence. Alcohol, gambling, adultery, smoking and publicly engaging in profanity or unbecoming dress wear shall be made illegal and liable to a fine if engaged in, with the sale of the worst vices carrying potential jail time."
BBR_collective_management:0 "Encourage Collective Management"
BBR_collective_management_desc:0 "We understand that supporting capitalism need not be at odds with communities. Collective management of properties, businesses and other profitable ventures should be encouraged via a tax credit, with a larger reward for those businesses who use the money saved from collective management and communal living to sell at lower prices to our citizens when possible."
BBR_economic_independence:0 "Economic Independence"
BBR_economic_independence_desc:0 "Stopping the reliance on loans and banks was a good start but still there are too many individuals and communities who are economically dependent on unneeded ventures when energies could be directed towards truly productive activities. The purchase of life insurance will be discouraged as will the acceptance of monetary welfare unless it is related to finding employment."
BBR_feed_the_poor:0 "Feed the Poor"
BBR_feed_the_poor_desc:0 "With much of money saved from ending economic dependence increasingly going to communities and churches it is time to further help those whom Jesus said would always be with us, the poor.

BBR_anti_corruption_campaign_desc:0 "It is no surprise that with the chaotic and sudden start of our Republic that corruption remains an issue, with many bribing bureaucrats to 'speed things along' or look the other way.

BBR_multi_racial_churches:0 "Multi-Racial Congregations"
BBR_multi_racial_churches_desc:0 "Sadly despite the power of religion in unifying many churches remain separated on the basis of race. We must coordinate with local pastors to encourage interracial tolerance and yes even congregations, and encourage whites to visit black churches! All churches that fulfill this goal will gain bargaining power within the NCC."
BBR_power_of_faith:0 "The Power of Faith"
BBR_power_of_faith_desc:0 "If there is a universal empowerment available to all it is in faith.

BBR_reject_races:0 "Reject All Racialism"
BBR_reject_races_desc:0 "It is not enough to tolerate one another on the basis of race, but to abolish the category all together. There is no Black or White Race in the Bible, making the category meaningless. From now on racial distinctions within our public system will no longer be recognized and the churches will be encouraged to spread the word that race is dead now that faith has replaced it."
BBR_spiritual_patriotism:0 "Spiritual Patriotism"
BBR_spiritual_patriotism_desc:0 "With the old racialism destroyed in favor of faith, we need to cement our national identity to unify those within our borders.

BBR_calm_racial_tensions:0 "Calm Racial Tensions"
BBR_calm_racial_tensions_desc:0 "While legally whites and blacks have equal rights under our Republic that certainly does not mean that they enjoy always cordial relations.

BBR_rural_schools:0 "Rural Schools"
BBR_rural_schools_desc:0 "Unsurprisingly due to the conditions of the Jim Crow South many black children in rural areas are badly undereducated for the task of taking on the future economy.

BBR_expand_nnbl:0 "Expand the NNBL"
BBR_expand_nnbl_desc:0 "The NNBL is the backbone of large scale Black Business in America, though it could not operate in the South with great ease.

BBR_lower_insurance_prices:0 "More Affordable Insurance"
BBR_lower_insurance_prices_desc:0 "Insurance has been a longtime struggle of Black Americans, with many resorting to mutual aid types societies.

BBR_affirmative_action_desc:0 "The damage Jim Crow has done to black America can not be understated and even now racism exists.

Affirmative action will create quotas in these arenas creating fines if they don't oblige."
BBR_fine_hate_groups:0 "Disarm Extremists"
BBR_fine_hate_groups_desc:0 "While militants stand fervently by their rights to firearms this is little more than a ruse that gives them an opening to enact violence on those they disapprove of or attempt to overthrow the government as they already have. The Peace Act will illegalize heavier firepower, limit the amount of guns one can buy and stop assembly of armed militants in our Republic, and require them to surrender their existing excess of weapons."

Our ancestors - those of the tribes of Dan and of Judah, and as the children of King Solomon - fled far and wide across the planet, ending up in Ethiopia, where they established a new monarchy, a new Solomonic dynasty, and a new population - the Beta Israelites - while others spread farther still and eventually ended up in the New World. We are their kin, their heirs, and their brethren in the Faith. We are the children of the Lost Tribes, and this heritage is our legacy, proving to all that we alone are the true Jews of this Earth.

Advocating for a purely Black faith, Rabbi Cherry professes to be the herald of the Lost Tribe of Judah and claims that Jesus too was a Black Jew, as well as our ancestor and messiah. Fusing minor non-Jewish Abrahamic beliefs into the faith while doubling-down on Garveyite principles, if Cherry is chosen to aid Rabbi Matthew, the pair will prepare our nation for the end times that will bring our Chosen people to pious prosperity."

Tied to Egyptian, West African, celestial, and Futurist aesthetics, this new movement shall become the bedrock of our new culture and identity, and with Sun Ra as the champion of this new movement, our coalition shall hopefully endure long enough for our infantile Afrofuturist state to stabilize, though a firm economic and political direction will soon have to be declared. Though ‘Sun Ra’ is merely just a puppet to these hidden powers, being used as a unifying figure to bridge the gaps between our groups, he will be the herald of this new dawn, and perhaps our eventual savior if this ill-fated coalition does not last."

This has begun to evolve naturally into a cult of personality around ‘Sun Ra’ as his music, his message, and his entire persona only grow more popular and more beloved - even eclipsing the image and influence of the government at times. The state shall utilize this fame to its benefit, and institutionalize the Cult of Sun Ra as a state philosophy.

Though many believe him to just be speaking figuratively to inspire creativity, wonder, and passion into our people as we build our new nation, those closest to him know that there is something more to his words than just hollow hopes and dreams. Regardless, our coalition has indulged their rising living symbol, and has allowed him to plan a series of cosmically-themed cultural and public works campaigns around the state, while also tacitly promising him that our nation would attempt to build a rudimentary space program in order to fulfill his dream.

This band not only is the prime form of expression for our national father, but is also the single most popular artistic or entertainment group in the nation while standing as one of the main pillars of our new culture and identity.

This is obviously dangerous to our government's desire to finish off the ODP and work with local whites but they continue to pledge troops and commanders so long as the conflict goes on, as they say this does not mean they will accept bending the knee to any white faction either.

Stewart and NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, claiming we are keeping them 'hostage' and that our government has sold out to socialists and Jews. We are feeling the heat of cracking down on the nationalists as young men refuse to sign up for the army and nationalists cause internal damage. With the even more radical NOI calling for war we may have bit off more than we can chew. The African Blood Brotherhood is the only wing of our party that has somewhat cordial relationships with these groups and their followers, and under Duse Muhammad and Cyril Briggs they are offering to undo the 'damage' our government has done if given top cabinet and military positions. Those whom view the ABB as ultra-nationalists in socialist clothing or as a bizarre cult itself claim we should refuse but other SPA members claim that is the only way our government could hope to overcome our enemies."
bbr.5.a:0 "No, we stay the course"
bbr.5.b:0 "Appoint the ABB"

###ABB IN POWER###
bbr.6.t:0 "Nationalists Released!"
bbr.6.d:0 "The Nationalists we imprisoned have been released by the African Blood Brotherhood after they agreed to be loyal to the government and cease advocating for an Old Democratic alliance. In return, they have been given voting positions in an expanded Congress as well, which as a unicameral congress makes them heavily influential to the annoyance of some other left radicals, although they have vowed not to introduce legislation that would risk undoing their de facto 'parole'. Meanwhile the ABB has sent written works of their organs, the Crusader and the Hamitic League of the World, to new recruits and officers, increasing their membership roster from members of the military."
bbr.6.a:0 "Solve one problem, create another"

bbr.7.t:0 "Duse Muhammad Elected!"
bbr.7.d:0 "Introducing sudden legislation for a snap election, the ABB has put forward their Executive Heads, Duse Muhammad and Cyril Briggs, as new candidates to run the government, calling for an on-the-spot election in Congress while some left syndicalist leaders such as Paul Robeson, Harry Haywood and Ben Davis were called for a meeting with CSA officers and representatives. With the backing of the National Syndicalists, the newly appointed Nationalists and a small number of syndicalists whom agreed they were preferable to the current government, he was elected. DuBois sees this as little more than what virtually every other political faction views it as, a coup. The head of our military, General Charles 'Captain' Young, is having none of the most recent bout of government incompetence following this coup by extremists, saying that if DuBois backs him and his military faction by using his emergency powers to give Young executive powers and deliver him SPA backing he will remove the coup leaders from power and stabilize the ongoing conflict so it doesn't swallow the Republic."
bbr.7.a:0 "Appoint Young"
bbr.7.b:0 "It's not right"

bbr.8.t:0 "ABB in Power!"
bbr.8.d:0 "The African Blood Brotherhood has seized control of the government and has begun to remove oppositional members of Congress from office. A most recent article by ABB intellectual leader Cyril Briggs has called on the Black Belt to join the ABB as soon as possible to aid the cause, and they are currently pressuring remaining socialists to convert by force, jailing those who don't. This has most controversially lead to an arrest warrent for A. Philip Randolph, a reformist SPA leader who has since fled the country for a more socialist friendly one."
bbr.8.a:0 "Stay the Course!"

bbr.8000.t:0 "Potential Allies"
bbr.8000.d:0 "The so-called 'Red Totalists' is a loose grouping of left vanguardists who mutually dislike one another, and with the IWW and left-wing SPA in the region they make up the left revolutionary forces in the region. Despite our proclaimed devotion to anti-imperialism and worker liberation, our policies so far have left us controversial in these corners, who are demanding we show our devotion to the revolution by sending supplies to the Commune of France at once. Likewise, they are denouncing our 'state capitalist' policies and request greater autonomy for the syndicate unions, although we believe we could win over the Red Totalists if we give into some of their demands, followed by gradually absorbing and retiring their current leadership. Of course, this would be costly in the short-term, causing some to float the idea of brining in UNIA to provide support in their place and immediently move to absorb the Revolutionary Left as a whole, in one swift strike. Briggs himself advises working more closely with the left, despite Duse Muhammad's former connections with UNIA."

bbr.8001.t:0 "The White Proletariat"
bbr.8001.d:0 "While our recent policies have left us with repossessing many businesses and lands owned by middle and upper-class whites to be instead controlled by the state or given to allies, there is a controversy regarding the 'white proletariat'. Cyril Briggs views them as a potential revolutionary force, and believes we should leave them as are to work alongside black workers with so long as they recognize this is a Black State, and do not attempt to climb the ranks internally. Likewise, he would be willing to sponsor them to move to revolutionary nations that are majority white so long as they are allies. The right-wing of the ABB on the other hand, while willing to ally and support white revolutionary nations abroad, view the domestic white proletariats and farmers in our region as having built their wealth on the back of whites, and think we should possess much of their existing wealth and lands, and place many of those who may cause problems, or can not afford to have their wealth possessed state communes to work alongside other reactionaries."

bbr.8002.t:0 "The Black Pharoah"
bbr.8002.d:0 "Duse Muhammad has been revealed as the Black Pharoah, a title given to the Head of State of the Black State and the head of the ABB. Despite the name, it officially is a Republican title that is passed down via election among Party Elites, although some are wondering how seriously the title should be taken and if Mohamed Ali should still behave as a Party Leader or keep himself out of the limelight and built up in a near religious manner to help build a Civic Religion modeled on the ABB's conception of Ancient Egypt."

bbr.8004.t:0 "Fate of the Black bourgeoisie"
bbr.8004.d:0 "Until now, we have kept the Black bourgeoisie who have not resisted us somewhat intact, with their largest enterprises (and incomes) now being officially state owned properties with them managing it on our behalf under the new state corporations and syndicates. However with the handing out of titles and state properties some are wondering if we should extend these priviledges to members of the Black bourgeoisie who appear loyal to us to increase their loyalty and take advantage of their managerial skills, or if we should focus on empowering only long-time party members, in the process weakening the old bourgeoisie in favor of pure party rule."

bbr.8005.t:0 "Robert Church Jr. Killed"
bbr.8005.d:0 "The Crusaders have reported that Robert Church Jr. has been killed due to his connections to the New Republican Party and his funding of 'liberal militants'. A wealthy businessman who inherited a prominent savings bank from his father, it was one of the wealthiest organizations in the National Negro Business League, which is currently being dissolved and peeled apart by the Crusaders and our militants, making Church's death the latest in a series of killings of wealthy blacks who oppose the ABB and leaving his assets in our hands."
bbr.8005.a:0 "A Success"

bbr.8006.t:0 "Faith in Education"
bbr.8006.d:0 "Despite our best efforts which include illegalizing the Peace Party and arresting the charlatan Father Divine, the more mainstream Christian Churces continue to survive and even thrive despite some turning against it in favor of our National Mythos or even socialist materialism. This has lead to pushes in the ABB to emphasize discrediting Christianity in schools in favor of what the ABB views the natural faith of Black Culture, which is a seemingly strange mixture of materialism and appeals to more ancient traditions the ABB claims belongs to Blacks."
bbr.8006.a:0 "A Great Initiative"
bbr.8006.b:0 "Yes, and squeeze the churches"

### Nationalists Tolerated ###

bbr.9.t:0 "Nationalists Parade Treaty!"
bbr.9.d:0 "In response to the ongoing casualties of the war, the Nationalists claim they have a way of ending the war in short order, having supposedly secured a treaty with the CAR leadership, especially the ODP and Young Klan. Claiming that the CAR and Black Belt have a shared interest in standing against 'Race-mixing, financial masters and Jewish Power' they are calling on our government to appoint their coalition to power to end the war! Outside their circles their calls have been decisive, with some believing this to be essentially treason, others viewing them as racial elitists themselves selling out our moral cause and finally many viewing this as an opportunity to end the war even if they don't agree with the Nationalists personal views. With the CAR making sure to make civilian casualties against our population devastating when possible to put down the revolt once and for all, many are fearful of what and who they will lose if they do not accept. The left-wing of the SPA of course still desires them imprisoned for their treachery."
bbr.9.a:0 "We can do nothing"
bbr.9.b:0 "Arrest their leaders"

bbr.10.t:0 "March on [BBR.GETCAPITAL]"
bbr.10.d:0 "The Nationalists have decided to march on the congressional capital to show their dissatisfaction with the ongoing conflict in a call for peace and a new alliance across race-nationalist lines which they claim will end in not just Black prosperity but a "Black-American Empire". Claiming that we had and have a moral obligation to accept the terms of their treaty for 'the sake of saving Black lives' their numbers have continued to swell among those enamored with their many promises. Even worse, our intelligence operations tell us they have received supplies and support from sections of the ODP and Young Klan to aid them in this endeavor. The SPA and much of the military leadership are of course furious at this development and recommend routing them at the march, although this would be costly during a time of war. In response, General Charles Young has offered to not only end the threat at the March but if appointed as a regent implement policies to account for these loses and create a more battle ready state while continuing to end the national emergency of the Nationalist insurgency."
bbr.10.a:0 "We can't afford to stop them by force"

bbr.11.t:0 "Nationalist March Succeeds"
bbr.11.d:0 "The Nationalists marched on the capital today armed to the teeth and with a large following of thousands of supporters whilst most of our fighting men were busy on the front lines. DuBois, the SPA and many liberals in Congress evacuated in response and claimed they would return to avenge the backstabbing UNIA and NOI. Despite their cries however the Nationalists claimed success and called on an end to the war, with only the African Blood Brotherhood and a small handful of liberals remaining from the Old Congress after they had taken power."
bbr.11.a:0 "We are in their hands now"

### Nationalists Take Power ###

bbr.12.t:0 "Leadership Election"
bbr.12.d:0 "The Nationalists may have taken power but they have not settled the question of the dominant power in their Congress. While UNIA has a larger number of followers the NOI manages to compensate for its sizeable militia and increased fanaticism among those who do believe in the 'Prophet', Elijah Muhammad. Furthermore, the UNIA is suffering from a lack of united leadership itself as their actual leader, Marcus Garvey, is still in Liberia building an UNIA organization there. With the NOI appealing to their militancy and clear leadership and the UNIA to their more palatable platform to the public, it was a near deadlock in the Congress. Eventually they both appealed to the remaining nationalist-leaning members of Congress whom hadn't fled with the socialists to use their remaining influence to act as kingmaker and broker a backroom deal on each of their behalf's. With Wilfred Adolphus Domingo as the leading negotiator and diplomat between them, only one could come out on top."

### UNIA Takes Power ###

bbr.1200.t:0 "Mission from UNIA"
bbr.1200.d:0 "UNIA has been growing its influence within our nation and is using its diplomatic connections to push for unification with the Black Belt. Marcus Garvey, head of the Liberia-UNIA is demanding that we comply, and the funding he has received has given him his own 'African Legion' militia. Naturally, UNIA promises us rewards if we comply and threatens us with force if we do not."

bbr.1200.b:0 "Resist"

bbr.1201.t:0 "Return of Garvey"
bbr.1201.d:0 "Liberia has caved to our demands! With our mission to Liberia being a success thanks to the efforts of UNIA in both nations, the original founder of UNIA and greatest promoter of Black Nationalism in the world, Marcus Garvey, has returned to retake the mantel as the leader of the organization after he was deported from the country by the FBI. As James Stewart has officially been standing in for him, he will have to comply in return for being named the heir to Garvey."
bbr.1201.a:0 "A Great Day"

bbr.1202.t:0 "Return of Garvey"
bbr.1202.d:0 "Liberia has refused our demands! Marcus Garvey and his African Legion and UNIA is in exile after being pushed out by Liberian government and has returned home to retake the mantel as the leader of the organization after he was deported from the country by the FBI. As James Stewart has officially been standing in for him, he will have to comply in return for being named the heir to Garvey, who promises that Liberia will pay for its treachery."
bbr.1202.a:0 "At least he survived"

bbr.1203.t:0 "Conquest of America"
bbr.1203.d:0 "We have taken the United States! Naturally, we have few citizens in this region who qualify as pure Black citizens and we expect massive resistance if we attempt to hold it. As such we are being pressured by the cabinet to release the United States under a White Separatist Faction named the Young Klan, a group of White Nationalists who have worked with Black Nationalists before and promise to enforce racial laws that agree with ours as well as an alliance and payments. Of course, we could attempt to dominate the region directly and use its resources for a Black Empire of sorts."
bbr.1203.a:0 "Release the US"
bbr.1203.b:0 "We hold it"

bbr.1204.t:0 "Status of the NOI"
bbr.1204.d:0 "While the NOI were our allies in the early days of the coup it is clear that they are no longer needed and that they still have designs on ruling the nation. As such, with our cornering of political power, we will either have a deal with them to give them local autonomy in return for ending their national ambitions and political party or crush them."
bbr.1204.a:0 "Crush Them"
bbr.1204.b:0 "Cut a Deal"

bbr.1205.t:0 "Young Klan Offers"
bbr.1205.d:0 "The faction of the Young Klan that has favored working with the Black Nationalists have reacted to our recent racial policies with mixed results, disliking the treatment of local whites but acknowledging it is tolerable so long as white ethnostates exist. They have stated we should place them directly in charge of white communities with some more autonomy, in return offering greater alliances and favorable local policies."
bbr.1205.a:0 "Agreed"
bbr.1205.b:0 "Disagree"

bbr.1206.t:0 "Status of the Mixed-Raced"
bbr.1206.d:0 "We can not ignore racial realities established by genetics and biology, and as such we must decide what to do with those who are of mixed-race heritage living in our nation as Garvey has made their inferiority and impure bloodline a known problem with our brand of Black Nationalism. We could make it legal to only join higher UNIA offices if one is a pure-blooded Black while only working with racially approved citizens or go further, and further segregation to make them considered a new racial category to be separated from pure Blacks."
bbr.1206.a:0 "Bar them from Politics"
bbr.1206.b:0 "Create new categories"

bbr.1207.t:0 "Liberty Halls Expand"
bbr.1207.d:0 "Liberty Halls are the common official meeting places for our organization. As such with the rise of UNIA it has seen expansion and now we are receiving requests to endorse them as a new form of townhalls, making UNIA's civic and political meeting place one and the same while receiving further state funding."
bbr.1207.a:0 "A fine idea"
bbr.1207.b:0 "It's not needed"

bbr.1208.t:0 "Back to Africa"
bbr.1208.d:0 "With Liberia back in our hands it is time to start achieving Garvey's dreams to send more Black citizens there. Of course, with our new sovereignty in the West it is less needed than it once was and this makes a useful hub of operations, causing calls for us to only send a handful for now."

### NOI Takes Power ###

bbr.1210.t:0 "Arresting Gladys Bentley"

They went on to mock our beliefs as not truly Muslim. Of course, this has only fired up the NOI base as being even more willing to strike."
bbr.1211.a:0 "Infidels"

bbr.1212.t:0 "Jews Flee!"
bbr.1212.d:0 "With our recent policy of fining and seizing Jewish wealth and businesses that NOI doctrine states is built on Black slavery, Jewish citizens are attempting to flee the state! Some think it would be best to let them go while hardliners don't like the idea and think they would go on to support our enemies, claiming they are already part of a conspiracy against us, and think they should be segregated into ghettos."

bbr.1213.d:0 "An unorthodox religious group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites have become increasingly active in our lands and are best known for their belief that Black Americans are the true descendents of the Tribe of Israel. We have had contact with a handful of these groups, some of whom are Black Nationalist and Supremacist, however other Black Israelites are not. As such the nationalists such as the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations have asked us to run out the non-nationalist factions. Of course, some within our government think the whole theology needs to be crushed and poses an internal threat to our power."

bbr.1214.a:0 "We can relax now"
bbr.1214.b:0 "Support a similar policy"

bbr.1215.t:0 "Liquor Smuggled"
bbr.1215.d:0 "With the NOI's banning of liquor, an underground movement devoted to smuggling liquor has been created. Worse yet, these dens promote other immoral banned behavior such as repulsive music, blasphemy and other drugs. The Fruit of Islam requests additional funding to find these criminals."

### Liberalism Prevails ###

bbr.13.t:0 "Nationalists Fail!"
bbr.13.d:0 "The Nationalist March on our congress failed today despite their numbers, with our army managing to route them and arrest the March leaders. Elijah Muhammad has fled the nation while most of the UNIA leadership has already been arrested. While some are upset the resources it cost us to end this would-be coup will destroy our nation the socialists claim it was necessary and are celebrating their victory over reactionaries."
bbr.13.a:0 "Very well"

bbr.14.t:0 "Future of the Nation"
bbr.14.d:0 "With the Nationalists having been felled and a lack of an internal common enemy there is now widespread disagreement between socialists and liberals on the future of the nation. The Syndicalist, Communist and other revolutionary left factions explicitly want us to include the 'People's Amendments' within our constitution which will restructure Congress partially after the Commune of France and have trade union representatives elected directly by workers become the largest force of our Congress and guarantees of 'rights to the full value of their labor'. Furthermore, it will limit the ability of pro-Capitalist parties to challenge the syndicalist system though they disagree on how far to go in this regard. However, the first draft will at least strongly limit capitalist wealth and the ability to found large businesses, disallow 'capitalist and reactionary' influence of the political system and illegalize 'collaboration with extreme, anti-Democratic and/or foreign pro-capitalist and pro-imperialist forces'. \n\nThe liberals and progressives have accused the revolutionary left of attempting to have a monopoly on political power and of de facto excluding non-Revolutionary left forces, calling it a de facto dictatorship, an accusation the syndicalists resent. They have put forward the Constitution of the Black Republic, which contains universal suffrage within a traditional political model with regional voting, separation of powers and the limitation of government power including in allowing some level of private property, which they say is necessary not only for liberty but for economic growth, investment and prosperity. With Du Bois having executive power and a major political wind since felling the right-nationalists, he will have to decide on one."

bbr.15.t:0 "Socialists Celebrate!"
bbr.15.d:0 "The People's Amendments have been adopted and with it the revolutionary left and socialist trade unions are celebrating although liberals and business owners are less sure of what to think. However as there are many internal disagreements on the nature of the socialist system and how far it should go many are calling for a snap election, especially Paul Robeson who essentially leads the orthodox syndicalist faction and is a strong defender of an economically egalitarian worker-run democracy while also supporting revolution against current capitalist forces and believes that the Red Militias are needed to protect workers rights. Running from what commentors call his right is James Ford's Centralist Socialists and Du Bois' wing of the Socialist Party. Both believe in a more gradual transition to socialist and maintaining some elements of the market where it may be of help, however Du Bois defends decentralization and mutual aid whereas Ford is a longtime ally 'Browderist' and believes in a centralized form of socialism with a pan socialist-vanguard and political pragmatism to protect it. This has led to accusations of Ford being little more than an opportunist by others but his seeming pragmatism and clear policies has led to much popularity."
bbr.15.a:0 "Victory"

bbr.16.t:0 "The Left-Vanguard Runs"
bbr.16.d:0 "It appears as though Robeson is not only being challenged from his right but from his left. Two politicians have appeared to give him a run for his money, 'Fosterite' and Trade Union Unity League leader Harry Haywood being considered the more radical of them. Calling for a total revolution Haywood chastises Robeson for stopping short of what he considers a full-revolution against the forces of reaction, stating that building the new worker's economy to accelerate towards Communism and destroying the imperialists and their structures, internally and externally, should come before all else. \n\nThe other is the 'Jacobin' Ben Davis who models his beliefs off of the French Faction of the same name and their inspiriations from the Russian Bolsheviks and ealier European Communist Parties. Believing in transitioning from a syndicalist structure to a Party-based one he is a strong believer in a strong leadership that will 'aid the worker in building a ready state to defend the revolution' while defending against anti-Communist forces, and in shifting the goals of the revolution from syndicalism to a 'Black-American Bolshevism' which can then be used to aid the Internationale. Robeson has criticisized both of them for 'betraying the worker to protect him'."

DuBois leads the radicals and argues that an alternative to capitalism is neccessary whereas the moderates led by Philip A. Randolph are more strongly opposed to radical socialism and want to work within a more capitalist framework. As the primary between them heats up it has come down to a race between the radical DuBois and the moderates who are split between the labor leader A.

Despite their unorthodox nature and Father Divine often being ridiculed for claiming to be God himself (a view he no longer brings up in public), their pacificism and emphasis on Christian morals has led to widespread sympathathies among local religious leaders not turned off by their other views and they have widespread support among Christians who view them as possible saviors of the Republic against both greed and radicalism, making them serious contenders in the election."

As such we need to decide what to do with these churches, with the main proposals being to only shut down ones promoting reaction and some calling for a greater purge of religious conservatives from public conscience, including the old Peace Party activists as well as a more vigorous promotion of State Atheism."

bbr.29.d:0 "The New Communist League has been one of our rivals on the Southern far-left for nearly a year now, and it is clear that Benjamin Davis does not appreciate our efforts so far. Criticizing our decentralized forces, intense criticism of union culture as reactionary, encouragement of the masses to clear out reactionary forces rather than doing it ourself and criticism of insufficiently socialist nations, Davis and his forces in the Socialist Congress believe that we acting dangerously by not setting more centralized economic planning, emphasizing a top-down party membership and over-relying on the Red Guards as being chaotic and destroying the country.

bbr.30.d:0 "Benjamin Davis and his inner circle has been tried by the TUUL as having served reactionary forces posing as 'socialist' after his NCL organization came under increasingly intense attacks, to the point of most of its members being exiled, imprisoned or dead.

bbr.32.t:0 "Harry Haywood Liquidated"
bbr.32.d:0 "Harry Haywood had no shortage of criticisms for our government, claiming that we were reactionary for not doing enough to emphasize collectivization among the masses, combating social reaction and imperialist influences in our culture and our 'overrelying' on bureaucratic procedures. Naturally this had led to suspiciouns of the TUUL and its various militia cells which refused to be absorbed into our government, and has caused for us to announce that Haywood was a social reactionary himself who needed to be liquidated. As such, he has already been arrested and executed and we with the head of the organization decapitated we need to decide whether to dismantle the TUUL altogether or keep a pro-government variant of it around."

bbr.33.d:0 "We need to deal with the primary syndicalist organization in our nation at once, with many criticizing our appeals to Vanguard Socialism.

bbr.34.d:0 "Throughout the nation those activists and journalists still held affinity with the UNIA, NOI and the right-wing Liberal Parties are being arrested and either exiled, offered clemancy for confessions, imprisoned or executed. However, there is still debate over the nature of the African Blood Brotherhood and its National Syndicalist Views, which many view as as either syndicalist or nationalist depending on whom one talks to. While they will obviously have to join the central government and obey it if allowed to stay, there are those who view them as potentially treachorous."
bbr.34.a:0 "Destroy them"

bbr.35.t:0 "Absorbing the Socialist Party"
bbr.35.d:0 "With James W. Ford now being recognized as the Head of the Socialist Party and his appointees being now leading the party we are steasily absorbing the other wings of the party, although the Social Democrats are reluctant to jump fully on board unless we offer them some favors, such as allowing some businesses to grow slightly larger before being potentially nationalized and appointing more of their wing to government."
bbr.35.a:0 "Agreed"

bbr.36.t:0 "Capitalists Flee!"
bbr.36.d:0 "The Capitalist Class is fleeing the nation en masse as the workers take over factories and attack former strike breakers and owners. Landlords on the other hand are simply giving up their renting spaces, often asking for a small fee that they give up on when the Red Militias visit them. Of course, with the Capitalists running, some think we should detain them so some can stand trial for their behavior. There is also, of course, the problem of capital flight, as management being neglected until workers organize and the outflow of goods capitalists can take with them is causing a temporary deindustrialization."
bbr.36.a:0 "Stop them"
bbr.36.b:0 "Let them go"

bbr.37.t:0 "The Great Purge"
bbr.37.d:0 "The Great Purge is underway in the Black Belt with suspected opponents of the government in the military, public services and former militia associates being arrested en masse.

bbr.37.b:0 "I think not"

bbr.38.t:0 "A Social Revolution"
bbr.38.d:0 "Across the nation, young radicals encouraged by the TUUL are liquidating former landlords and remaining petite-bourgeousie owners, assaulting teachers who still teach reactionary ideals around 'America' and are destroying those with backwards social views, especially among the religious classes. However, some local TUUL representatives think we should slow the revolution so as to focus on political rehabilitation of these offenders rather than destruction. Should we side with them or the Red Guards."

Popular for his food recipes to produce peanut butter, Carver was involved in developing soil techniques to aid farmers and for his research into environmentalism. Hours after his death Tuskeegee Institute announced it would be honoring Carver and naming the Agricultural Department after him for his advancements, friendship with Booker T Washington and association with the Institute.

He swears that he will restore stability at all costs, to the outrage of the New Communist League and TUUL, though both the right-leaning Republicans and left-leaning reformers seek his favor."

bbr.41.d:0 "With our crackdown on the revolutionary left we are left with an internal controversy over the fate of Paul Robeson, leader of a representative organ of the IWW in our country. While Robeson is popular to the masses, his devotion to syndicalism is unnerving to many in the cabinet who suggest he be deported to the Commune of France. Of course, there will be a public outcry so we could try to work with him in private and promise some union related concessions to keep syndicalism at bay."
bbr.41.a:0 "Deport him"

bbr.44.t:0 "Unions demand contracts!"
bbr.44.d:0 "With our recent projects, the unions are demanding they be given even more favorable contracts. In order to appease them, we may need to give them the bulk of public building contracts despite the higher price, which would win over remaining parts of the SPA, especially James W.

bbr.45.t:0 "Page demands Concessions!"
bbr.45.d:0 "The left-wing of the army under Thomas Page is demanding concessions in response to our crackdown on the left. They desire for us to cease our crackdowns on the left in the future, to grant Page a place on the leading army council and to swear we will not go to war with the Internationale. With rumors that Page helped Haywood escape the Black Belt in the first place and kept as much of the left militants as he could out of the raids, he is not exactly popular with the council, but denying him would deny us a great many men."
bbr.45.a:0 "Agreed"
bbr.45.b:0 "Disagree"

bbr.46.t:0 "State of the Judicial Branch"
bbr.46.d:0 "With the Judicial Branch in our nation still coming into existence many of our policies so far emulate the United States. However there are calls to stop making Judges appointable by political leaders at once, as it gives certain political factions too much influence over law. As such the judiciary would have an independent system for reviewing and appointing judges."
bbr.46.a:0 "Endorse it"
bbr.46.b:0 "Leave the current system in place"

bbr.47.t:0 "DuBois Condemns Cultural Policies"
bbr.47.d:0 "W.E.B. DuBois has condemned our governments cultural policy of embracing Americanism as oppressive to African American Identity and a step backwards for the country. While he has little power, his influence in the SPA is still felt and doing some damage to our reputation, meaning we should likely put forward those willing to debate him on behalf of our party."
bbr.47.a:0 "Debate him"
bbr.47.b:0 "Ignore him"

bbr.48.t:0 "Enacting Roman Law?"
bbr.48.d:0 "With our legal system still forming right now Common Law, based on the legal code of the United States, is the norm. However most in our government would prefer what they feel is a more reliable, fair and centralized system of legal code by adopting Roman Law, in which codified statutes overrides past judicial decisions and interpretations. This will allow us to detail true American Law without having judges redefine it whenever it is convenient, although we would have to accept the cost of restructuring the legal system."

bbr.49.d:0 "A new form of music is taking the country, and Louis Armstrong and other musicians in the "Jazz Movement" are being influential celebrities that went from playing in establishments that offer liquor, dancing and other services to playing on a national stage and in record studios. The craze for Jazz is only increasing, to the outrage of religious groups who call the music sinful."

bbr.50.t:0 "Interest in Creole Spikes"
bbr.50.d:0 "Interest in Creole culture has skyrocketed in some of our higher education and in popular media, as some view it as an identity that is more wholly identified with the Black Belt.

bbr.51.t:0 "Robeson Demands a Seat!"
bbr.51.d:0 "With our creation of the Labor Board, Paul Robeson is demanding a seat on the board to represent the syndicalist IWIU. While this would increase syndicalist influence in the short-run, it could allow us to take the edge off their radicalism while gaining their support."
bbr.51.a:0 "Bring him in"
bbr.51.b:0 "He's too radical"

bbr.5100.t:0 "IWIU Shrinks"
bbr.5100.d:0 "The IWIU has suffered falling influence thanks to our recent economic reforms, and as a result syndicalism and even radical socialism holds less influence over the population, although Paul Robeson himself remains both popular and a syndicalist throughout this recent recline. Nonetheless, it appears as though we won't need to worry about leftist revolution at the moment."

The NOI group refused to surrender and instead fired upon the officers, resulting in a shootout that left 16 dead. Elijah Muhammad has denounced the 'attack' and called on other NOI cells to prepare for attacks.

With some of their cells being broken for holding illegal weapons, conspiracy or engaging in violent rhetoric they have found themselves in retreat with the numbers to back up their claims.

However, W.E.B. DuBois, A.

bbr.1824.t:0 "Liberia Joins the Fold"
bbr.1824.d:0 "An electric atmosphere of glee and jubilation has engulfed the BBR today as news of our Pan-African rebels’ success has reached our borders. Across the Atlantic, brave paramilitaries fighting for the Pan-African struggle have finally succeeded in their mission to topple the ruling regime of the Liberian government, forcing the far-off African state to become fully subservient to our will. Over the coming weeks, the administration and bureaucracy of their state shall be merged into our own, completing what is now but the first step on the road to fulfilling the Pan-African dream. Now, together with our newly reunited Afro and Americo-Liberian brothers and sisters, we march into the beginnings of our new destiny."
bbr.1824.a:0 "A true victory for the Pan-African dream!"

bbr.1825.t:0 "Just Good Business"
bbr.1825.d:0 "With New York breaking free of the dying union in a similar fashion to ourselves, we have enjoyed solid relations with the Big Apple - particualritly due to our shared goals of national self-determination and large Negro populations. Interestingly however, NYC has fallen to crime and corruption, and after a drawn-out struggle for power, the Harlem-based Negro kingpins Casper Holstein and Stephanie St. Clair now dominate New York City. With both St. Clair- the Queen of the Numbers Rackets - and Holstein - the King of Bolita - holding criminal, political, and familial links to our Black Belt, we have already begun working with these far-off cousins in order to benefit both of our infantile states. As they send profits and illicit goods back to our borders, we shall send them arms and volunteers in return, and together, we shall make America a land where our kind can truly live in peace and prosperity now that we are free at last."
bbr.1825.a:0 "Let us hope this King of Bolita and Queen of Harlem can be of use."

bbr.1826.t:0 "Not All Whip-Crackers Are Bad"
bbr.1826.d:0 "Though we are slowly building a new Negor state here in the Black Belt, we still hold ambitions of creating an America that is open and equal to all races, colors, and creeds, and as such, though most of our members and supporters are Negroes themselves, not all of them are. Perhaps one of the only true allies to our cause from the White Man’s world is Walter Francis White - a Georgian native who has dedicated his career and life towards the pursuit of Civil Rights and race equality in America. A leading figure of the National Association for the Advanment of Colored People, or the NAACP, since 1929, White has been one of the most outspoken supporters of the American Negro for over a decade, and as such, he is to be honored by our state. In perhaps the most lavish ceremony ever given to a White Man within our infantile republic, Walter White has been recognized and rewarded for his fierce dedication to the cause both in the courtroom and out on the protest line, rising to be one of the only universally-respected White men in the Black Belt."
bbr.1826.a:0 "A true ally to our cause."

###MLK Events###

bbr.2001.t:0 "The Rise of ‘Daddy King’"
bbr.2001.d:0 "Though the Peace Party has largely been dominated by its co-founders Father Divine and James Jones, a third figure has been rapidly rising through the party ranks. The moderate but devoted and pious Michael King Sr. has begun to rise up the party hierarchy utilizing his immense and growing popularity. Perhaps the most popular clergyman in all of Georgia, this Daddy King of Atlanta might just be the new face the Peace Party needs, for all is not well in our administration. \n\nThe current leader of our party and nation is Father Divine - a devout Chrisitian that also happens to believe himself to be the physical manifestation of God. This belief was once just a small aspect of Father Divine’s personality, but it has now come to dominate his persona and his policy. Though he still wants what is truly best for our people and the nation, his zealotry is bordering on insanity. With party co-founder James Jones only feeding these delusions of grandeur, Father Divine’s god-complex has only inflated exponentially, and many feel he is partially to blame. In response, these disillusioned members of the Peace Party and our republic’s wider congress have begun to propose Michael King Sr. as a unity candidate for the party. What will happen remains unknown, but Michael King’s popularity only continues to rise as our party continues to destabilize."
bbr.2001.a:0 "Perhaps this pious young firebrand can be of use to us."

bbr.2002.t:0 "Who Must Lead the Peace Party: Father Divine or Daddy King?"
bbr.2002.d:0 "With Father Divine’s mental state only getting worse, for our national father truly believes himself to be God incarnate, many within the Peace Party and the wider congress of our nation have been murmuring for a change in leadership. The most obvious candidate to uplift would be James Jones - co-founder of the party with Father Divine, a devout Christian, and a titan of the Civil Rights movement. However, Jones’ legacy has been tainted by his acquiescence of Father Divine’s delusions, with Jones even backing him up and feeding Father Divine’s god-complex, only making the delusions worse. Luckily for us though, there is another. \n\nThe rising star of the Peace Party, Michael King Sr., has been nominated by a large and quickly growing group of moderates within the Peace Party that have begun to garner support from ministers across the aisle. These detractors of Father Divine claim the nation needs a new leader with a steady hand and a sane mind in order to guide us to the Promised Land, and state that this Michael King is the fresh, non-radical face the party and the nation needs to thrive. However, if we do not force Father Divine to retire, perhaps King can still help him stabilize the nation and the party from within his cabinet. Regardless, if we are to keep our mandate alive and strong, the Peace Party must solve this internal dilemma immediately."
bbr.2002.a:0 "Quietly push Father Divine to retire, and inaugurate Michael King Sr.!"
bbr.2002.b:0 "Father Divine shall stay in command, but Michael King shall rise to aid him."

bbr.2003.t:0 "Daddy King’s Moderate Christian Republic"
bbr.2003.d:0 "With Micheal King Sr. at the helm, our republic has taken a decidedly less-radical turn. While the policies on Christian ‘Pan-Americanist’ patriotism, piety, anti-racialism, and other wins for civil rights were to be kept in place, Father Divine’s more extreme laws are now to be rolled back and made less harsh. The strict chastity laws have been loosened, allowing small amounts of smoking, drinking, and profanity while also dropping the ban on giving gifts, the limits on how many people can be in one mixed-sex grouping, and the strict national dress code, among so many other ludicrous laws. Welfare and insurance have been reintroduced, though administered by Christian institutions, and capitalism has been made more socially responsible. Though Father Divine is still uplifted by the state as a hero, he is no longer an infallible one, and the developing cult of personality around his god-complex has been snuffed out. Good, moral, non-dogmatic, and non-sacrilegious piety has been brought back to our republic, and under President Micheal King Sr., the future for our people has never seemed brighter."
bbr.2003.a:0 "We shall strive for freedom and justice for all under God and Daddy King’s guidance."

bbr.2004.t:0 "Rebuilding the House of Michael King and God"
bbr.2004.d:0 "During the chaos and horrors of the Second American Civil War, many landmarks and icons of American culture or our faith were destroyed and desecrated. One such icon was the Ebenezer Baptist Church - one of the most famous Black Churches in Georgia and the very house of worship of our own Daddy King. Micheal King Sr. got his start at that parish, rising through the hierarchy of the Church there and eventually becoming the Church leader, but it was tragically burnt down by a mob of Old Democrats and Klansmen led by a man named George Ellis Ray shortly before the conflict ended. With our reacquisition and reconciliation of Atlanta, President King has moved to have the Ebenezer Baptist Church rebuilt atop the ashes of the old one, where it will stand as a memorial to those lost in the conflict, and as the new center of both his sermons and the Peace Party."
bbr.2004.a:0 "May the sermons of Daddy King continue to guide us for ages."

bbr.2005.t:0 "He has a Dream"
bbr.2005.d:0 "With our pious agenda being so popular across the nation, the number of new clergymen has skyrocketed since the end of the Second Civil War. With a new generation of pastors, priests, ministers and more rising to take the mantle of the great generations before them, our church elders today seek to hone these new rising holymen into devout and wise leaders. One such new rising pastor is none other than the son of our own Michael King Sr. Michael Luther King Jr. - named after his father and given the Conformation name Luther due to he and his father’s shared admiration for the famous Protestant protestor - has risen to be one of the most popular young religious figures in Atlanta. Born in 1929, Michael Jr. has been by his father’s side for years, following his rise to power and learning in his shadow. A studied theologian, a fierce advocate for civil rights and social justice, and a moderate Christian Socialist, Michael Jr. is a man of conviction, dedication, piety, and with a deep love of all humanity. Despite a period of losing faith during his adolescence, his crisis of faith has been resolved now that he is free from under his father’s shadow, and he is known for his fiery rhetoric, his immense and powerful speaking voice, and his ability to rouse a crowd and be a leader to his fellow man - abilities that have come to adorn him with much respect and popularity from his community. Though he is still young, currently studying at Morehouse College, he has become one of the rising stars in the eyes of the Church and the state - a fact likely aided by his relationship to the President. He dreams that one day the racial issues that divide us will finally come to pass, so that we all may walk into our new future together."
bbr.2005.a:0 "One day, this dream will come true!"

bbr.2006.t:0 "The Long March for a Civil United States"
bbr.2006.d:0 "With all of the former Union now united under the Peace Party, President [root.getleader] of the now-dismantled Black Belt Republic has been inaugurated as President [root.getleader] of the United States of America. The first Black President in American history and a devout Baptist, [root.getleader] and his Peace Party now position themselves to crusade across this restored Union in the name of racial equality and piety. Seeking to abolish the ideas of skin color and race, President [root.getleader] is the herald of America’s new golden age of peace, racial harmony, and prosperity. Though his views may be unpopular with some, he has won the right to lead this nation after winning the bloody quagmire that was the Second Civil War, and now all Americans shall rejoice under God, Christian capitalism, and the sermons of [root.getleader]."
bbr.2006.a:0 "We shall march for freedom until not one million, but all millions in this nation are by our side!"
bbr.2007.t:0 "Black Hebrews Protest Wealth Seizures"
bbr.2007.d:0 "Though our asset seizures have been going relatively smoothly in much of the nation, our administration has experienced significant pushback from one small but incredibly vocal group - the Black Hebrews. Largely led by Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew of the Commandment Keepers Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation of the Living God Pillar & Ground of Truth, with aid from Frank S. Cherry and Howard Zebulun Plummer, these Black Hebrews once were spread throughout the American countryside from New York City to Tennessee to Virginia, but with the creation of our Black state, most migrated to our borders in droves. Since then, their movements have only grown and coalesced in this safe-haven our people have labored to create, and now they stand as a significant obstacle to our goals. These heretics may share our skin, but they follow a faith that is utterly reprehensible to everything the Nation of Islam stands for. We must decide what to do with these Black Hebrews soon, lest they grow to be a real threat to our regime."
bbr.2007.a:0 "Let the heretics protest. What is the worst that can happen?"
bbr.2007.b:0 "Send in the troops! We will crush them before they get out of hand."

###Black Jews Events###

bbr.2008.t:0 "The Spread of Black Hebrew Militias"
bbr.2008.d:0 "It would seem that our decision to let the Black Hebrews continue their protest has backfired, for their numbers only continue to grow as Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew and his allies indoctrinate more of our innocent citizens into their demented faith. Even now, Black Hebrews across the nation have begun to take up arms, forming militias to protect themselves from our police forces and military reprisals. Parts of the nation in Georgia and Alabama have become militarized zones, with small fire-fights between Muslim and Jewish paramilitaries breaking out occassionaly as barricades and makeshift fortresses are built in city streets. Conflict is in the air as these centuries-old faiths do battle on new soil with fresh blood, and many fear that it is too late to stop the rise of these false sons of Jacob. Though they claim to be the true Lost Tribe, we should remind them of reality before they consume our Nation of Islam and everything the Prophet stands for."
bbr.2008.a:0 "They are only fanatics and zealots. They can do no real harm..."
bbr.2008.b:0 "Eradicate these Black Hebrews before it is too late."

bbr.2009.t:0 "Rabbi Matthew and the Black Hebrews Launch a Coup"
bbr.2009.d:0 "Not reading the writing written on the wall as clear as day, our administration has let the Black Hebrews spread and grow like an unfettered disease, and now the forces of the Commandment Keepers and their allied paramilitaries and militias have begun to march on the capital. With [root.getleader] leading the defence and with Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew leading the attack, it would seem that the Holy Wars have finally crossed the sea and now the New World shall be the sight for this next confrontation between Abrahamic faiths. With Frank S. Cherry’s death squads cutting a swathe of destruction through the city as a river of innocent blood flows behind him, and with Rabbi Matthew and Howard Zebulun Plummer pushing with the main force to the heart of the capital’s administrative district, we must act fast to stop these Black Hebrews from toppling the Nation of Islam. With our backs to the walls and with ammunition and manpower running low for both sides, it is only a matter of time before this horrid play finally plays out, and the nation that is left standing in the aftermath may be irrevocably different from the state we defend today. Let us hope that today, it is our side that the Lord prefers as we march to settle the destiny of our Black utopia."
bbr.2009.a:0 "The Hebrews win! Let us create a new Zion for all true sons of Judea to enjoy."
bbr.2009.b:0 "The Muslims rally! Crush these infidels for the Prophet!"

bbr.2010.t:0 "Future of the Israelite Cause"
bbr.2010.d:0 "With the ferocity of the Abrahamic faith now waning and with our varied military forces mopping up the last big pockets and cells of resistance, our new holy land is finally secure and stable, at least somewhat. This new atmosphere of placidity has allowed our regime and our people to catch their breaths, and now comes the great labors of civilization building we have before us. However, before we embark on this journey as we seek to turn the Black Belt into the new holy land of the Black Hebrew Israelites, a direction for our state and our faith must be chosen. \n\nBefore us lies two paths - on one hand, the Commandment Keepers Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation of the Living God Pillar & Ground of Truth could rule alone under Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew, and move to create a Black-centric and Pan-African inspired but open holy land for all Jews across the world. Under his tutelage, we would embrace our Ethiopian heritage as the true heirs of Solomon and the Beta Israelites. On the other hand, Rabbi Matthew could align with the second largest congregation to bolster his power - the Church of the Living God, the Pillar of Truth for All Nations, led by the violent radical Frank S. Cherry. Rabbi Cherry’s brand of Afro-Israelism states that not only are we the true Jews, but we are the only worthy souls on this planet. Advocating for race war and wholesale slaughter of the many heretics that besiege us, his extreme views have grown in popularity in the wake of further atrocities wrought upon our people at the hands of the KKK and the Nation of Islam. Though Rabbi Matthew shall remain in power regardless, this decision shall determine the future of our faith and national ambitions. What shall we do?"
bbr.2010.a:0 "Rabbi Cherry is chosen to help shepherd our people alongside Rabbi Matthew."
bbr.2010.b:0 "Rabbi Cherry is a dangerous extremist! The Commandment Keepers walk alone."

bbr.2011.t:0 "Future of the Black Hebrew Economy"
bbr.2011.d:0 "Now that our matters of the faith are decided and solidifying, we must now decide how our new national economy should function. Once again, we have two options before us, tied to the two largest Negro associations with ties to our flock. The two main groups are the African Blood Brotherhood of Cyril Briggs, George Wells Parker, and Duse Mohamed Ali, and the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League of Marcus Garvey and James R. Stewart. Though Garveyite nationalism forms one of the main pillars of our state, and though Marcus Garvey is a close friend of Rabbi Matthew, many within our flock have ties to the ABB over UNIA. With this split, we must choose one group to favor, pulling in more of their members into the one, true faith while incorporating some of their economic and social policies into our administration. Regardless of our choice, we shall still be friendly to both groups and equally pursue our shared goal of a Pan-African ideal, but should our journey to a Jewish Pan-African holy land be tinted Red with the Social Nationalist and Communist ideals of the ABB, or dyed Black with the Afrocentric Supremacism and Populism of the UNIA-ACL?"
bbr.2011.a:0 "We stand with the African Blood Brotherhood!"
bbr.2011.b:0 "The UNIA-ACL as the only true allies for our state!"

bbr.2012.t:0 "The Only Real Jews"
bbr.2012.d:0 "What does it mean to be a Jew? Does it merely mean to study the Torah and to adhere to our beliefs? Does it mean to just blindly go to synagogue without true connection to God? Does it just mean to eat only Kosher foods, or to be circumcised, or to just celebrate b’nei mitzvah? We, the only true Jews, say no! \n\nYou must experience the trials and tribulations, the horrors, and the oppression our ancestors experienced. You must pour out your own sweat and blood in devotion for Yahweh and the faith. You must feel the very pain and tragedy of our forefathers, the patriarchs of the twelve tribes. And only one group on this planet has truly done just that unrelenting for millennia - the Black Hebrew Israelites. Through immense pain, through noble sacrifice, through gut-wrenching loss, we have endured, and this existence of struggle has only made our own people - the Chosen people - stronger and more devout in our adherence to Judaism. This history proves that we are the one, the only, true Jews on God’s Earth, and now this lost tribe has been found, we shall prove it to the world and to every heretic within our borders. Enemies of the state, heretics, sinners, and false Jews shall have nowhere to run, and nowhere to hide, for God’s Chosen are finally coming to exact our revenge on the lesser sinners of this planet. Like a new first Passover, we shall go door to door through every inch of our new holy land and ensure that our Chosen people are finally free."
bbr.2012.a:0 "The only real Jew is a Black one!"

bbr.2013.t:0 "The Heirs of Solomon"
bbr.2013.d:0 "As the children of the Tribe of Dan who settled in Ethiopia to become the Beta Israelites, and as the heirs of King Solomon of Judah, Son of Jacob, and Makeda, Queen of Sheba, who had a child in secret who would rise to be Menelik I, founder of the Emperor of Aksum, we have both royalty and true Israelite blood coursing through our veins. With this legacy in mind, revealed to Rabbi Matthew after historical discussions with Marcus Garvey decades ago, our regime has modeled itself closely on the internal structure of the modern Ethiopian Empire, both socially and in political organization. Long fascinated with this heritage, Rabbi Matthew and his long-time ally Rabbi Arnold Josiah Ford have moved to foster closer ties with the Abyssinians. \n\nHowever, Rabbi Ford has slowly pushed Rabbi Matthew to take this idea even further, suggesting that we should move to crown the current ruler of the Solomonic dynasty - Emperor Hailie Selassie - as the King of our new holy land as well. He would serve as a new Menelik and Solomon - a figure to unify the nation and to solidify our connections with our supposed heritage. However, it is highly unlikely that the Emperor would ever accept this proposal - for he is notably adverse to deification and also largely ignorant of our movement’s existence. Regardless, this shouldn't be an issue, for we shall be able to crown him and use him as a tool of the state whether he is within the nation or not, for the truth here in our holy land can be anything we want it to be. However, many see this idea as ludicrous, and perhaps it would just be best to establish diplomatic ties with these kin of ours instead."
bbr.2013.a:0 "Diplomatic and economic ties shall be enough, for we do not want to offend His Grace."
bbr.2013.b:0 "Whether he likes it or not, or even knows about it, Hailie Selassie is our rightful king!"

 bbr.2014.t:0 "Breaking Bread with our Fellow Jews"
 bbr.2014.d:0 "With the aid of his close friend and confidant Davide de Sola Pool - one of the only White Jews to come to our new holy land in the initial wave of settlers - Rabbi Matthew has begun a series of goodwill missions across the globe in order to meet with foreign Jewish communities. Through food drives, charity events, the establishment of new health clinics and synagogues, through financing Jewish support and seperatist groups, and so much more, we shall use our prosperity and newfound freedom to help the foreign Jews who have safeguarded the faith for the millenia our people have been ‘absent.’ The goal of these missions is to build closer bonds of trust between our varied congregations as we slowly try to convince our fellow Jews to the truths we profess. Though they do not have to fully accept our creed, they must realize we come in peace and only want what is best for the wider Jewish faith. Though it will take great effort and much time in order to win these skeptics over, we shall endure, for this is our task given to us by our ancestors and by Yahweh Himself."
 bbr.2014.a:0 "In time, they will come to accept the truth." 

bbr.2015.t:0 "Culling the Flock"
bbr.2015.d:0 "With our people prepared and our nation geared for war, the time has come to decide our final ambitions. Following the words of the new prophet Frank S. Cherry, we know the truth of the future that will unfold. At the dawn of the 21st century in the year 2000, Jesus the Messiah will come down from Heaven in order to guide our Chosen people in a race war to eradicate all non-Black Hebrew Israelites from this earth. With this destiny in mind, most in our nation are content to guard our borders and to further purify our new holy land here in the South, but there exists a radical faction urged on by Rabbi Cherry and his ally Jehu August Crowdy that seeks to start this final labor early. In order to prove our faith and loyalty to God and to Abraham before the arrival of Jesus, and to ensure we survive until his arrival, these extremists preach that we should march across the wartorn lands of the old United States and burn every aspect and facet of their old, sinful, and decadent civilization to the ground. The regime that lords over the failed Union is nothing but a den of hedonists and heretics, and only we are worthy enough to purify the taint they have left on this sacred soil. Though another war would be costly, and likely deeply unpopular with many in the nation, many others chomp at the bit for their chance at revenge against the regime that oppressed our people for so long. What is our destiny - should we wait for Jesus, or should we get this final struggle rolling once and for all in preparation for His arrival?"
bbr.2015.a:0 "The South must be cleansed fully as we wait for the new millennium."
bbr.2015.b:0 "We shall start the final labor of Jesus early, and burn the old Union to the ground!"

bbr.2016.t:0 "New Land of Milk and Honey"
bbr.2016.d:0 "With our new holy land now secure and open to all true Sons of Jacob, we proud disciples of David and Abraham have created the Land that was Promised ourselves. The Black Belt has been transformed into a new holy land for the Chosen people, and it is all thanks to our hardwork and perseverance, and the brilliant guidance of Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew and the patriarchs of the Commandment Keepers. However, with our new paradise now standing strong and prosperous, many within our administration have begun to argue as to what our national ambitions should be now. \n\nThe more conservative among us seek to stay within our borders here in the Deep South of America, suggesting we focus on building up this new Land of Milk and Honey in our heartland only with claims that only the Black Belt is the true holy land of our revitalized faith and people. However, radicals across the aisle believe that all of the former United States belongs to we Chosen, and have declared that we should march across the old lands of the dead Union to deliver these sinners from their evils while we save our brothers in race and faith across the nation. With debate as fierce as ever, it is us to Rabbi Matthew, so how should our new Zion look towards the future?"
bbr.2016.a:0 "The Black Belt, and only the Black Belt, is the true, new Holy Land."
bbr.2016.b:0 "The Chosen will not rest until all of America is made into a pious utopia!"

bbr.2017.t:0 "America Burns Under Rabbi Matthew and Rabbi Cherry"
bbr.2017.d:0 "Like the Locust of the Plague the sinners of this empire of hedonism and oppression have eaten away at everything that has made this continent holy and good, but this time of debauchery is at an end, for the lands of the failed Union are now ours! Under the boots of our proud soldiers, we have tread on the American snake, crushing their false notions of freedom and liberty while taking a torch to their entire civilization and everything it once stood for. Washington, D.C lies in a heap of ash and cinders as the New Sodom of this failed land - a symbol to all that we are the deliverers of Yahweh’s justice and judgement. Every false church and heretical place of worship has been torn down, leaving either new synagogues or piles of bodies in our wake. Blood runs through the streets of each hive of sin as our people get their retribution against the American population after centuries of oppression and neglect, and any living members of hateful organizations like the Ku Klux Klan or the failed political parties of their dead democracy have been forced to run and flee in terror as we hunt down every last one of these wretched demons in human form. To be a Black Hebrew Israelite in this burning land of impiety is to be one of the Chosen, with everything our state can provide given to them without question, but to be anything else means only immediate punishment and judgement before God, and a violent death. Our holy land is the Black Belt, and the burning empire around us is our warning to the world - your time is running out and your days are numbered, for when the Messiah finally returns, we Chosen shall deliver this justice to the wider world!"
bbr.2017.a:0 "Their empire of sin is now a wasteland of ash, and atop it we shall build paradise."

bbr.2018.t:0 "A New ‘Kingdom’ of Israel"
bbr.2018.d:0 "We have done it! The empire of sin and debauchery that was the old United States of America has finally been cleansed and purified, and now a new United Provinces of Zion stands in its place. This new holy land, the Land that was Promised to the Chosen, shall be our new Kingdom of Israel like our ancestors were forced out of all those centuries ago. Emperor Haile Selassie of the Abyssinians is our sovereign, and though he does not accept this title or even live within our borders, we know that he is truly our king. Like him, we are the heirs of Solomon’s grandeur and wisdom, and with his image binding us as Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew shepherds our people into paradise, this new Land of Milk and Honey is sure to bring peace and prosperity to the Chosen once and for all. All Judaic disciples of Abraham shall be given refuge here if they so desire it, and we shall take care of each and every single one of them as if they were our own, for now is not the time for infighting in our southern paradise - now is the time for healing and unity. No longer are we slaves to the Romans or the Egyptians. No longer are we the playthings of the Babyolonians or the White Man of Western Civilization. We are the Chosen, and this is our new Eden!"
bbr.2018.a:0 "Let us rejoice under Yahweh and Abraham, for the Chosen are finally free."

bbr.2019.t:0 "Executing the Traitorous Hebrews"
bbr.2019.d:0 "With the attempts of Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew and his Black Hebrew allies foiled, our holy state has been secured. In accordance with Sharia Law and in recognition of the hudud crimes committed by Matthew and his allies, Elijah Muhammad has called for these heretical zealots to be tried before God and executed by the state. After a brief show trial adjudicated by Muhammad, the Prophet declared that the lower leaders of the Black Hebrew movement like Frank S. Cherry and Howard Zebulun Plummer were to be put to death by public beheading, but Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew himself would instead be subjected to death by lethal stoning. \n\nRabbi Matthew and his compatriots were soon carried through the streets of Charleston, stripped naked as the massive crowd of on-lookers hurled rotten food and garbage at their bodies while shouting curses and obscenities at the traitors. The atmosphere of violence was so intense that a few of the lower members of the Commandment Keepers being executed this day were killed before they could even reach the gallows, with one such low-ranking Rabbi being shot by a young NOI fanatic by the name of Malik el-Shabazz, who has since been lauded as a state hero. As the criminals were finally marched up onto the public platform at the middle of Westside Park, the process of executing these heretics was soon underway. After a brief introduction of prayers and speeches by Elijah Muhammad and his confidants, the executioner got to work. Within moments, the heads of Frank Cherry and Howard Plummer, along with a few other lower Rabbis, were rolling across the floor of the gallows and onto the grassy ground below, spilling blood and spinal fluid as they twitched and fell to the earth. With these accomplices and zealots dealt with, the final head of the Hebrew Hydra was all that was left to dispose of. After a barrage of stones and rocks beat his naked body, ripping open more flesh with each meaty, dense thud, Wentworth Arthur Matthew collapsed in a pool of his own blood while the crowd around him cheered, chanting the Prophet’s and Allah’s names as they moved to mob the stage so that they could tear this traitor’s corpse apart. As the cacophony of violence and retribution finally ended, Elijah’s state stood more secure than ever before, atop a mountain of heretical blood and an unshakeable faith in Allah."
bbr.2019.a:0 "We shall erase this movement before its roots can truly settle."

bbr.2034.t:0 "Rebuilding That Which Was Lost"
bbr.2034.d:0 "With our recent bettering of relations with our lost brethren within the Empire of Abyssinia, ties between our two peoples have never been stronger. Given this massive boast in good relations between our nations, it comes as no surprise that the authorities of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church have gifted our people the original Ark of the Covenant, which has long been held in the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Arriving only a few days ago under cover of darkness on a ship with no discernable markings so as to not attract unwanted eyes, the Ark that has so long been away from it's true owners has finally been returned. Despite this gift and our announcement of receiving it, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims they made no such gift and that whatever we have is not in fact the original Ark. While those in our government and even our own know better than these lies, some doubt as been shed on to the reality of the Ark's orgin.\n\nIn order to quell these rumors and provide suitable housing for the Ark, Rabbi Matthews has greenlight a project to rebuild the Ark's old house, the Temple of Solomon itself! With the entire Temple's construction and plans being laid out to the last cubit in the book of Kings as record in the Nevi'im, construction shall be a breeze. In order to acquire the vast amount Gold, Sliver, Iron and various other resources that will be needed, a campaign encouraging donations from amongst our own populace as well as the various diaspora communities of our brothers around the world shall take place. Along with this, those who resist our rule, such as the Nation of Islam among others, shall also contribute, for if they don't, they shall risk losing what little liberties they have left. It is expected to take roughly 4 months to build this lost monument to the Glory of God. As construction is underway, the Ark shall be taken around our fair realm, so that the Blessings of God Almighty may fall upon us all."
bbr.2034.a:0 "May God bless our efforts, where all others have failed!"

bbr.2035.t:0 "A Question of Sacrifice"
bbr.2035.d:0 "After four months of long, arduous labor, we have finally done it. The Temple of Solomon, destroyed long ago by the Babylonians, once more stands. Just as the original, the Ark of the Covenant, within which rests the very tablets written on by God along with the last of the Manna that God fed us with on our flight from Egypt, lies within the very heart of the Temple, protected and safe. With the competition of the Temple and the Ark laid to rest within, a final question remains. Originally, the Temple dubbed as the House of the Ark as well as the center and sole acceptable place for Sacrifice. The Sacrifices, ranging from Doves to Cattle, were a bloody offering to God for Sin. Every Israelite was expected to offer something on behalf of his sins, at least that was before the Advent of Christ into the world. As Christ died upon the Cross, all Sins were forgiven, and the original sin of Adam was forgiven. Despite this, the priests and High Priests of Israel would counite to offer Sacrifice, up until the Temple was destroyed once more, this time by the Romans. With a Temple once more standing however, many are wondering if perhaps the time has came to reinstate Sacrifices. After-all, Christ only died for original sin, and man has sinned far worse since the time of Christ. However, even if we were to reinstate Sacrifices and the Priesthood along with it, we would be lacking a critical piece, that being the High Priest. The High Priest as always been a son of Aaron, of the tribe of Levi, as mandated by YHWH, however since the death of the last High Priest, the ability to track Aaron's family has been lost. However, those who wish to reinstate Sacrifice are not without hope. The beloved Rabbi, Wentworth Arthur Matthew could very easily fit the bill. After all, it was YHWH's providence that allowed the Rabbi to lead us to victory over the Muslims, and it was YHWH who led the Rabbi to order the rebuilding of the Temple. It would not be to much of a stretch to take this a step further, and name the Rabbi the true Heir of Aaron, the rightful High Priest of Israel.\n\nWhile Obviously such a move would be radical to say the least, and would no doubt push us even further from our Jewish brothers, the blessings of YHWH that will inevitably follow might just be worth the risk."
bbr.2035.a:0 "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit, a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise."
bbr.2035.b:0 "The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek."

bbr.2036.t:0 "A Name for this New Promised Land"
bbr.2036.d:0 "With the Nation of Islam defeated and with Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew firmly in control of our destiny, it is finally time to declare a new holy land for the true Israelites. The Black Belt shall be a new land for our lost tribe to establish a pure and pious Jewish state, but first we must vote internally on a new name for our infantile nation. Though many names have been suggested, four have risen to the top as the most popular choices, and now it is down to a final vote. What should the name of our new Promised Land be?"
bbr.2036.a:0 "New Hawassa, after the life-giving lake in our homeland of Ethiopia."
bbr.2036.b:0 "New Judah, after the patriarch Solomon of our Lost Tribe."
bbr.2036.c:0 "New Gondär, after the heartland of the Beta Israelites."
bbr.2036.e:0 "New Israel, after our progenitor Jacob, the son of Isaac and grandson of Abraham."

bbr.2037.t:0 "The Fate of the Old Capital of Sin"
bbr.2037.d:0 "The old capital of the dead Union - Washington, D.C - now lies in the grasp of our Chosen people, and now we must decide what to do with it. Rabbi and Prophet Frank S. Cherry, along with his close ally Jehu Crowdy, have declared that Washignton is the New Sodom and must be burned to the ground and all of its inhabitants who do now come to the faith be slaughtered as a permanent example of what the fate of the sinner is. However, Rabbi Matthew, Rabbi Plummer, and Rabbi Ford all agree that instead we should merely tear down their old icons of hedonism, rebuilding the old Washington into a New Bethlehem for all Black Hebrew Isaelites to rejoice in. Though our holy land would still largely be in the Black Belt, this enclave of Judaic splendor could rise to become one of the key cities in our state, bringing more prosperity to our people. Both plans have wide backing from much of our congregations, and so the final choice lies in the hands of our shepherd Rabbi Matthew."
bbr.2037.a:0 "The District of Columbia is a relic. Turn this modern Sodom to ash and cinders and leave it to rot."
bbr.2037.b:0 "Rename the city to New Bethlehem and rebuild it in our image."

bbr.2038.t:0 "An Honorary Jew"
bbr.2038.d:0 "Founder of the Universal Negro Improvement Association, titan of the Pan-African and Black Power movements, and possibly the most loud-spoken firebrand when it comes to the rights of the Black Man, Marcus Garvey is one of the greatest Black men of this modern era - a true prophet and herald of our Afro-centric destiny. However, despite all the good he has done, Garvey is no Jew. However, given his close relationship with Rabbi Matthew and his Abrahamic beliefs, our state has moved to make Garvey an honorary Black Hebrew Israelite. He, along with a few other key figures to our movement such as Rabbi David de Sola Pool, founder of the ABB Cyrill Briggs, local pastor and peacemonger Michael King Sr, and a few others shall be the first group of honorary Israelites declared by the state. Each shall have their own bar mitzvah and be indoctrinated into the Church along with everything that comes with it, and though this shall largely be a ceremonial gesture, we still expect each recipient to at least pay lip service to their new faith. With these titans of the American Negro political scene at our side, we shall foster closer unity between the disparate groups of the Black Belt, for we have more important enemies we must focus on."
bbr.2038.a:0 "We salute Garvey and these other Black heroes, and all they have done for our people!"

bbr.2039.t:0 "Another Lost Tribe?"
bbr.2039.d:0 "As we solidify what it means to be a Black Hebrew and a member of the Lost Tribes, a new wave of thought has exploded in popularity within some parts of our new holy land. Our current lost tribe accepts Afro-Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and other groups of the wider Black Diaspora, as well as true Africans. However, this new movement has also tried to claim that the Native Americans, both of North and South America as well as Mesoamerica and the Caribbean, are another off-shoot of the Lost Tribes as well. Claiming these Red Men to be descended from the Tribes of Gad, Reuben, Zebulun, Levi, and the others, the followers of this new idea believe that we should open our arms to America’s other oppressed group, welcoming them as true Israelites alongside our own people. If we accept this idea, the Amerindians would be Chosen just like us, and be privy to the full benefits of such a label in our new Promised Land. However, firebrands like Rabbi Cherry find this idea to be preposterous and an affront to everything we stand for, while Rabbi Matthew and his allies have shown some tacit support to this strange notion. What should our stance towards the Red Men be?"
bbr.2039.a:0 "Red or Black, there is no difference. They are a lost tribe all the same!"
bbr.2039.b:0 "Are you serious? Black is best, and there is no substitute for the Chosen race."

bbr.2040.t:0 "Retribution Against the Slavedrivers"
bbr.2040.d:0 "As we slowly make our way across this land of sin and sodomy, we must carry justice along with us. We are the Chosen, the heirs of the original Israelites, and as such it is our duty to avenge the innocent Chosen blood these sinners have spilled across history. Every single one of their kind - man, woman, or child - shall be eradicated like the first-born sons of Egypt during the first Passover. Every false house of worship they cherish will burn like they burned the First and Second Temples of our people. Every survivor shall be bound in chains and forced to work for our state like we were forced to build their pyramids and palaces so long ago, and like we were forced to work on their plantations and estates just decades ago. Every injustice these demons ever delivered against our ancestors and our people shall be dealt back to them with tenfold severity, for the time for revenge is finally upon us. Burn their old order down, and atop the blood, bodies, and cinders, we shall build paradise."
bbr.2040.a:0 "Untold millennia of oppression finally avenged in one violent sweep."

bbr.2041.t:0 "Jews of the World, Unite!"
bbr.2041.d:0 "With the work of Rabbi Matthew and David de Sola Pool finally showing success, more and more fellow Sons of Jacob have come to our shores to at least experience our new Land of Milk and Honey if not to fully immigrate here. Among their numbers are famous Zionists like Chaim Weizmann, Haim Arlosoroff, Yitzhak Tebenkin, and Nathan Yellin-Mor, theologians like Raymond Aron, and patriarchs of the faith like Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn. Though many still find our methods too violent and our views on history being misinformed, the wise have either looked past these differences or have come to embrace them, for no true Jew would turn down an open invitation to a new nation all our own. Though we still have many holdouts - namely groups like the Rothschilds or the devoted Orthodox - many more have decided to come in peace, and now we shall work with these first settlers to continue to build this new Promised Land together."
bbr.2041.a:0 "We open our borders to any and all Sons of Jacob."

bbr.2042.t:0 "Cry White Boy"
bbr.2042.d.a:0 "Reports have come in from Charleston that a group of devoted Black Hebrew Israelites got into a public altercation with a young White Jewish American that has yet to be ‘cleansed.’ Claiming that these White Jews are nothing but the illegitimate bastards of the Khazars, the heckling Israelites mocked the history, struggle, and race of the White Jew. Forced to tears in the middle of the street, the young White Jew tried his best to stand against the Black Hebrews, but was eventually forced to run away crying after the Black Hebrews began to mock him over the various genocides White Jews have had to endure, saying that they pale in comparison to the horrors and bloodshed of Black slavery at the hands of the White Man, with his hecklers giving him chase. These proud Israelties have done our nation a proud service standing against the Khazar heretics, and with them eventually capturing the young White Jew, he has been brought into custody. This false pretender of the Chosen shall soon meet his maker, for only true Jews may live in our new holy land."
bbr.2042.d.b:0 "Reports have come in from Charleston that a group of devoted Black Hebrew Israelites got into a public altercation with a young White Jewish settler.

Though this event has thrown a wrench in our plans for fostering greater unity with our fellow Jews, we shall not let it become an obstacle. Attitudes like this are only normal with our people, and we must show them that these Khazar-sons are too real Jews."
bbr.2042.a:0 "That’s right!"

bbr.2043.t:0 "Bring Judaism Back to Africa"
bbr.2043.d:0 "As we bring the lands of Pan-Africa under our control, we must also bring with us our faith. Jewish groups already exist in Africa, like Semei Kakungulu’s Abayudaya, the Beta Israelites, or the Lemba of South Africa, and they shall be rewarded as such in time, but many more millions follow their own beastly or heretical faiths. We must show them the light of the one, true faith. By breaking from Jewish tradition that stipulates against missionary work and seeking converts, we shall entice our fellow Africans to join our faith. Even if force is necessary, we will bring Judaism back to Africa as we march to unite the lost tribes once and for all."
bbr.2043.a:0 "They will embrace the one true faith, whether they know it yet or not."


bbr.2044.t:0 "A New Land for the Chosen"
bbr.2044.d_a:0 "After endless war and conflict, the Pan-African dream has been realized. We Black Hebrew Israelites have conquered the homeland of our people, and now with the crowning jewel of Ethiopia firmly in our hands, we have moved to finally unite the lost tribes. The United Tribes of the Chosen shall finally rise, with our capital now rising in Addis Ababa, and though we still have much work to do to truly make Africa Jewish like it should be, we have finally at least tamed this wild land and brought it under our control. Our new Land of Milk and Honey shall now embrace all of Africa and the Black Diaspora, and Rabbi Matthew will raise this new promised land to paradise."

With this being the case, King Hailie Selassie, long the true King of our people, has also finally been properly crowned as King of Israel. While our sovereign shows little love or even interest in running our reformed Kingdom, and has allegedly claimed our whole movement is not but drivel in private. Regardless, with the King at our side at last, our new Land of Milk and Honey shall now embrace all of Africa and the Black Diaspora, and Rabbi Matthew will raise this new promised land to paradise."
bbr.2044.a:0 "The Lost Tribes have finally been found and united!"

bbr.2045.t:0 "Deliverance?"
bbr.2045.d:0 "The new millennia has finally dawned, and though all these decades have passed, it would seem that the Prophet Frank Cherry was wrong. Dying back in 1963, the mantle of Prophet has been carried on by his son Prince Benjamin F. Cherry, but still after all this time Jesus has not returned to us. The dream we have waited for seems to be a lie, or at least the Prophet Cherry was wrong about His arrival. As the year goes on, our people only grow more restless, and many have even begun to become disillusioned with our faith and teachings. Perhaps we were wrong all along?"
bbr.2045.a:0 "Impossible! Jesus will come! Maybe we just got the date wrong?"

bbr.2061.t:0 "Deliverance!"
bbr.2061.d:0 "The new millenia has finally dawned, and though all these decades have passed, we have endured - and now finally, we have been rewarded for it. Although he died back in 1963, Prophet Frank S. Cherry spoke the truth, and even with the mantle of Prophet now being carried on by his son Prince Benjamin F. Cherry, we have stayed devoted to his prophecy. Jesus of Nazareth, best of the Tribe of Judah and greatest of Yahweh’s gifts, has returned to Earth, descending from the heavens in a pillar of blinding light. By his bidding, we shall carry out his Final Struggle, and finally bring a baptism of purifying flame to this caustic empire of sinners."
bbr.2061.a:0 "With the Messiah here, let us cleanse this planet of sin once and for all!"

bbr.2062.t:0 "An Old Foe Rises in the East"
bbr.2062.d:0 "We Black Hebrew Israelites are the one and true Jewish people - this is widely known. However, the Ashkenazi vermin that have stolen our religion claim otherwise, but we know better. These false Hebrews, pretending to be true Sons of Jacob such as we, are truly descended from the Khazars of old - foul steppe tribals that stole our religion before our spiritual reawakening, and it would seem that this old enemy has risen once more. \n\nIn Crimea, the Karaite ‘Jews’ have risen, and though they claim to be the true Jewish folk, we know this to be a venomous lie. They have risen a new Khazaria in the name of their old Khaganate and now proclaim their putrid hive of squalor and barbarism to be the one true holy land for the Jewish race. There is but one course of action acceptable in times such as this with claims such as these being thrown about - annihilation. We shall sail for Europe and march into Crimea and burn their ‘civilization’ to the ground. With salted fields, cities in cinders, and their populace disappeared, we shall make this land holy and pure once again, for it is our duty as the one true Chosen."
bbr.2062.a:0 "Suffer not the bastard of the Khazar to live. Let us cull these false Israelites, for that is what’s right."
bbr.2062.b:0 "On second thought, we are not prepared for a naval invasion across the world. We must wait, for now."


###Sun Ra Events###

bbr.2000.t:0 "The Sound of the Afro-Future"
bbr.2000.d_a:0 "With our promotion and proliferation of a new ‘Black’ culture, new artistic movements both of sight and sound have spread throughout the nation. This new cultural revolution uplifts all that is Black as a paragon of human experience, with everything from music and art to cuisine and dance feeling the reverberations of this bombastic and soulful renaissance. However, no musical artist has been as promoted, as beloved, or as widespread in homes and offices across our state as the glorious Le Sony’r Ra. \n\nBorn as Herman Poole Blount on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, ‘Sun Ra’ - as he likes to be called - has become a pioneer of the New Afrikan musical scene. Blount, or ‘Sonny’ as his mother and sister used to call him, was born a musical prodigy, becoming a skilled pianist as a toddler and learning to compose and sight-read music before becoming a teenager. First getting his start in professional music after joining his High School Biology teacher’s band, Sun Ra would take off as a musical genius, eventually traveling to Chicago and then to New York, proving that Sun Ra had become a young but steady fixture of the national jazz scene before the violent birth of the Second American Civil War, and before he found himself elevated to be the symbolized sound of a whole newly birthed people. Now, he and his Arkestra use a combination of electronic instruments and outlandish vocalizations in a pure expression of conceptual, improvisational, modal jazz and our people’s shared soul. Along with music, he also dabbles in poetry, philosophy, theology, and political thought, standing as a true renaissance man of our new state. A noted Afro-futurist and Black nationalist driven on by visions of visiting Saturn, Sun Ra has tacit ties to both the ABB, UNIA, the Black Unity League, and the Nation of Islam, but steadfastly stays out of national politics as to not alienate his fellow man or his fans. With his Egyptian-influenced garb and his music from another world, this spaceman out of time is expected to bring new funk to our shores for decades to come as a nationally recognized and rewarded musical treasure."

We must keep an eye on this."
bbr.2000.a:0 "We ride his sonic waves into the groove of our new destiny."

bbr.2020.t:0 "The Rising Dangers of Radical African Nationalism"
bbr.2020.d:0 "With our government’s direction to maintain our ‘Americanist’ culture while suppressing Afro-Nationalist and Black Supremacist ideologies, we have begun to face some internal resistance. Rallying around the upstart avant-garde musician and poet Herman Poole Blount - also known as Le Sony’r Ra or simply Sun Ra - a radical coalition of varied Pan-African parties and political groups have begun to resist our new initiatives as they unify around this young herald of Afrofuturism. Composed of members from the African Blood Brotherhood, the Unity League, the Nation of Islam, and the United Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League, this radical Pan-Africanist coalition cannot agree on anything aside from their vaguely shared Pan-African dream. However, at least for now, they have banded together around this ‘Sun Ra’ while resisting our regime with both new-age art and seperatist actions. Though Sun Ra preaches non-violence, we cannot say the same for his new allies, and he is largely just a figurehead and symbol for their movement as opposed to any true leader. We must keep an eye on this situation, in case this artist tries to bite off more than he can chew."
bbr.2020.a:0 "A new threat?"

bbr.2021.t:0 "Pan-Africanist Groups Surge in Popularity"
bbr.2021.d:0 "Despite our initial efforts to quietly suppress and observe the radical Pan-African coalition, the popularity of both Sun Ra and his message have only grown exponentially. Rising to become the most beloved artist in the nation by the masses and with a growing powerbase behind him using him as a powerful political puppet, Herman Poole Blount seems almost untouchable. Our cabinet has begun to be concerned over his level of influence and power despite not even holding a public office, leaving our administration in an uncomfortable position. We must choose here and now to either crush this movement once and for all before it gets out of hand, or to uphold our democratic principles and let this funky, cosmic jazzman continue to blaze a trail across our nation regardless of the risks it may pose."
bbr.2021.a:0 "Liberty and Freedom for all comes first. Let them have their artistic movement."
bbr.2021.b:0 "These radicals can’t be trusted. Break up the coalition and crack down on Pan-Africanism."

bbr.2022.t:0 "The ‘Sons of Ra’ Attempt a Coup"
bbr.2022.d:0 "The signs were there, but we ignored them, and now the radical Pan-African coalition under Sun Ra has marched on Charleston demanding a change in power. Despite being backed by hundreds upon hundreds of loyal militia and paramilitary soldiers - each armed and ready to fight and die for their Pan-African Dream - Sun Ra has ensured that not a single shot has been fired - at least yet. Standing outside Charleston's colonial-era city hall surrounded by armed guards and zealots, Sun Ra has given an ultimatum to the Americanist regime - either lay down your arms peacefully and accept the will of the Pan-African people, or face the wrath of the masses who will not be denied their dream any longer. With the government’s local police force being outgunned and outnumbered, and with a large portion of the army already pledging support for Sun Ra and his coalition, it would seem that the only way Americanism will hold on in the Black Belt is through another wave of violence and bloodshed like that which birthed our infantile nation in the first place."

bbr.2023.d:0 "Frothing at the mouth for their sonic savior, the masses of the Black Belt have rapidly become more and more enamored with their Afrofuturist herald. As the music, poetry, and peaceful, celestial Pan-African message of Le Sony’r Ra touches the hearts and minds of more of our citizens, his power and influence only grows. Though he was initially just a young puppet and cultural symbol for the radical coalition, he has slowly begun to amass power in his own hands, for though the government may be dominated by his allies, the population of our new paradise all swear loyalty to Sun Ra over any Earthly government. As the cult grows, so too does our new Afrofuturist, cosmic identity, supported by West African, Afro-Caribbean, and Egyptian aesthetics and motifs, as does Sun Ra’s ability to lead our people as he pleases. Though he is still far from being able to rule alone, it is only a matter of time as the Cult of Sun Ra only drifts into further fanaticism as it gains more members."
bbr.2023.a:0 "May all bow to the splendor of Ra!"

bbr.2033.d:0 "Le Sony’r Ra has proclaimed that space is the place for our race - out there among the stars is where we shall find paradise and salvation as our sonic guide shepherds us into our cosmic destiny. Announcing the ‘Race for Space,’ Sun Ra has declared that the people of the Black Belt should look to the heavens and beyond to find our answers and what we need to survive. Spreading his cosmic and Afrofuturist message in order to rouse public interest in the cosmos, Sun Ra has begun a series of cultural programs while also funding the construction of new science and astronomy centers to begin this celestial voyage. Renowned Black astronomer and astro-scientist Walter Samuel McAfee has been raised to be the ‘Celestial Vizier’ to Sun Ra. In this position, McAfee will be the chief science officer in the nation, while also the main brain behind our burgeoning space program. Though we are still ages away from being able to grace the stars, McAfee and Sun Ra shall take this first step on our pilgrimage to the beyond."

Still propping up Sun Ra as their puppeted symbol of unity and our new culture, the nationalist socialists and extreme radicals of the ABB have taken full command over the economy and political organization of the Black Belt. The Hamitic League of the World - an American Negro nationalist organization that claims the the African race is the greatest of humanity - has risen to be a main component of our government while Black national syndicalist economics and Pharaonic culturalism have come to dominate our socioeconomic sectors as these new ideas fuse with Sun Ra’s Afrofuturist and pacifistic, cosmic philosophy. However, Sun Ra has not let these radicals fully alter his dream and desire with hate, and has gone to great lengths to spread a more moderate and inclusive definition of what it means to be African - even opening up the idea that all descendents of our African ancestors, that is all of humanity, should be included in this newly defined African identity. \n\nThough this has angered some in the ABB, they can do little to disobey the word of Sun Ra, for though he may not fully control the reigns of the nation’s government, he does control the masses with his sonic genius and artistic sound - a celestial spell that all seem hopeless to be able to break. Though the ABB is a dominating force that once only used Le Sony’r Ra as a puppet, it is becoming less and less clear who truly is in charge."

Still propping up Sun Ra as their puppeted symbol of unity and our new culture, the rabid anti-Imperialists and devoted Fosterite Pan-Africans of the TUUL have taken full command over the economy and political organization of the Black Belt. The Trade Union Unity League - a Union coalition bonded together with the ideals of Fosterite National Syndicalism, Agrarian Socialism, and radical devotion to anti-Imperialism and Pan-Africanism - has risen to be a main component of our government while Afrocentric cultural revivalism and internationalism have come to dominate our new society as these new ideas fuse with Sun Ra’s Afrofuturist and pacifistic, cosmic philosophy. However, Sun Ra has not let these radicals fully alter his dream and desire with their zealous devotion to Black National Syndicalism, and has gone to great lengths to spread a more moderate and inclusive definition of what it means to be African - even opening up the idea that all descendents of our African ancestors, that is all of humanity, should be included in this newly defined African identity. \n\nThough this has angered some in the TUUL, they can do little to disobey the word of Sun Ra, for though he may not fully control the reigns of the nation’s government, he does control the masses with his sonic genius and artistic sound - a celestial spell that all seem hopeless to be able to break.

Stewart has risen to be the leader of this new Afrofuturist paradise alongside Sun Ra. Still propping up Sun Ra as their puppeted symbol of unity and our new culture, the rabid Black Nationalists and Supremacist Pan-Africans of the UNIA-ACL have taken full command over the economy and political organization of the Black Belt. The African Legion - a paramilitary dedicated to protecting Black lives and all that we stand for as a race - has risen to be a main arm of our new government along with other UNIA organizations like the Black Cross Nurses and the Negro Factories Corporation, while Afrocentric cultural revivalism, anti-Socialism, Black coportaized capitalism, and Negro exceptionalism have come to dominate our new society as these new ideas fuse with Sun Ra’s Afrofuturist and pacifistic, cosmic philosophy. However, Sun Ra has not let these radicals fully alter his dream and desire with their zealous devotion to the ideas of Black Empowerment, and has gone to great lengths to spread a more moderate and non-violent way to show our superiority over our fellow, lesser men. Sun Ra has announced that it is the Black Man’s burden to uplift the beastly races of this world, for we must rise above our former oppressors and show them the error of their ways by building the greatest civilization the world has ever known here in our New Afrika - an idea that UNIA founder Marcus Garvey has even become interested in from his new foreign UNIA headquarters in Liberia. \n\nThough this has angered some in the UNIA, they can do little to disobey the word of Sun Ra, for though he may not fully control the reigns of the nation’s government, he does control the masses with his sonic genius and artistic sound - a celestial spell that all seem hopeless to be able to break. Though Sterwart and his UNIA is a dominating force that once only used Le Sony’r Ra as a puppet, it is becoming less and less clear who truly is in charge."
bbr.2026.a:0 "Together, we shall ensure the safety, prosperity, and pride of the Black race."

bbr.2027.t:0 "Working with the Nation of Islam"
bbr.2027.d:0 "With Le Sony’r Ra’s decision to align with the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad has risen to be the leader of this new Afrofuturist paradise alongside Sun Ra. Still propping up Sun Ra as their puppeted symbol of unity and our new culture, the rabid Black Nationalists and Supremacist Muslims of the NOI have taken full command over the economy and political organization of the Black Belt. Aspects of Sharia Law and Muslim culture have risen to be a main aspect of our new government while Afrocentric cultural revivalism, anti-Socialism, Black coportaized capitalism, and Muslim-Negro exceptionalism have come to dominate our new society as these new ideas fuse with Sun Ra’s Afrofuturist and pacifistic, cosmic philosophy. However, Sun Ra has not let these radicals fully alter his dream and desire with their zealous devotion to the ideas of Allah and has gone to great lengths to spread a more moderate, non-religious, and non-violent way to show our superiority over our fellow, lesser men. Sun Ra has announced that it is the Black Man’s burden to uplift the beastly races of this world, for we must rise above our former oppressors and show them the error of their ways by building the greatest civilization the world has ever known here in our New Afrika, supported by but not dominated by Muslim teachings, and has even guarunteed to the masses that our new paradise will remain secular. \n\nThough this has angered many in the NOI, they can do little to disobey the word of Sun Ra, for though he may not fully control the reigns of the nation’s government, he does control the masses with his sonic genius and artistic sound - a celestial spell that all seem hopeless to be able to break. Though the Prophet and his Nation of Islam is a dominating force that once only used Le Sony’r Ra as a puppet, it is becoming less and less clear who truly is in charge."
bbr.2027.a:0 "Together, our people shall be guided by both Allah and Ra to their celestial destiny."

bbr.2028.t:0 "He Came from Saturn!"
bbr.2028.d:0 "With the nation now solidified since the collapse of the radical coalition, Le Sony’r Ra has decided to reveal to the nation his greatest secret and most honest truth. In a televised and radio-broadcasted press conference, Sun Ra claimed that after receiving a vision in college, the reality of the universe was revealed to him - that he was an alien from Saturn sent to save the African race from this unjust and painful world and return them to the cosmic homeworld of our people on Saturn. He was quoted as saying ‘My whole body changed into something else. I could see through myself. And I went up... I wasn't in human form... I landed on a planet that I identified as Saturn... they teleported me and I was down on a stage with them. They wanted to talk with me. They had one little antenna on each ear. A little antenna over each eye. They talked to me. They told me to stop attending college because there was going to be great trouble in schools... the world was going into complete chaos... I would speak through music, and the world would listen.’ \n\nWith the arrival of devastating Black Monday and the horrific Second American Civil War, Sun Ra’s vision of doom was apparently proven true, only reaffirming to both himself and his followers that what he spoke of was the truth. He now professes that through sonic masterpieces, poetic epics, and cultural revival and revolution, we can rocket towards our Afrofuture together. Though many believe him to be crazy, many more have begun to believe this celestial prophets word, only increasing Sun Ra’s power with each passing day."
bbr.2028.a:0 "We shall follow this vision like it was prophecy!"

bbr.2029.t:0 "Spreading the Truth of Our Cosmic Origins"
bbr.2029.d:0 "With Sun Ra’s wild revelation to the masses that he is truly an alien sent from Saturn who shall use cosmic art and sonic genius to liberate the true African peoples, our populace has been divided. On one hand, we have the followers of Sun Ra and those devoted to his cult - which has come to encompass a large and growing majority of the nation - and on the other, those skeptics and naysayers that still doubt the splendor of Ra. Seeking unity, harmony, and peace above all else, Sun Ra has made it his personal mission to convince these doubters of his ultimate truth. Through new shows by the Arkestra and cultural programs, new waves of celestial propaganda, and by even visiting his loudest detractors personally to sway them himself, Sun Ra is determined to convince every soul in the Black Belt that he truly is the Saturnine Shepherd he claims to be, and that under his guidance, this new field of reeds shall become paradise."
bbr.2029.a:0 "From Saturn, we found Africa, and from Africa, we now find Aaru."

bbr.2030.t:0 "An Open Cosmic Philosophy"
bbr.2030.d:0 "Combining his own peaceful, intergalactic, and Afrofuturistic ideas with his new expanded definition of what it means to be African, as well as the Nationalist and Socialist ideas of his Leftist allies, Sun Ra has finalized his new cosmic philosophy. Proclaiming that since all humans hail from Africa far enough back in their lineage, all of humanity are the true Africans, and if all of us are the true Africans, then all of humanity are the sons and daughters of Saturn and worthy of all benefits such a title holds. Though we shall only strive to unite the lands of traditional Pan-Africa and the wider Black Diaspora, all shall be welcome in our Afrofuturist paradise, and Sun Ra shall care for all just the same as he shepherds all of us - the true cosmic Africans - into our celestial destiny. Now onwards, towards a truly Pan-African and extraterrestrial Afrofuture!"
bbr.2030.a:0 "Race does not matter, for we are all children of Saturn!"

bbr.2031.t:0 "A Racial Cosmic Philosophy"
bbr.2031.d:0 "Combining his own peaceful, intergalactic, and Afrofuturistic ideas with the Black Supremacist, Nego Exceptionalist, and Afro-Nationalist ideas of his reactionary allies, Sun Ra has finalized his new cosmic philosophy. He has proclaimed that as the true children of Africa, the Black race is destined to greatness above all other races, and though it is our duty to show our fellow, lesser man how to truly be cosmically civilized, that is not our end goal. The destiny of the African people is among the stars, and the Cosmic Pharaoh shall take us there. Out there in the cosmos, we shall find enlightenment and a just and promised future, and with Sun Ra as our guide, we will get to our paradise on Saturn one way or another. Though the lesser races of the world cannot come with us, we shall still nurture them, for it is the Black Man’s burden, but it will never become an obstacle to our destined greatness. Now onwards, towards a Black and supreme Afrofuture!"
bbr.2031.a:0 "The destiny of the Black Race is to reach enlightenment among the stars."

bbr.2032.t:0 "There is but One God..."
bbr.2032.d:0 "Religion, ideology, and other rulesets for life merely force people to live a certain way, locked into pre-set lifestyles and unable to truly express themselves in the fullest and most genuine way possible. This is slavery in its most widespread and enduring form as the ignorant and the misinformed sacrifice their possible fufillment and happiness by willingly throwing away their unique lives because they believe it is the truth, or maybe their only hope. Our people must each live to fulfil their true selves - not an imposed, forced, or deluded worldview. We must turn our back on gods and masters that once trapped our fates and alter our destiny so that we can charge forth into the Afrofuture untethered. Only our Cosmic Pharaoh, our Afrofuturist herald, our Pan-African savior of groove and funk can truly save us now, so let us rejoice under the one and only guide for the true beings of humanity - Sun Ra!"
bbr.2032.a:0 "...and His name is Ra!"

bbr.2046.t:0 "Growing Pains of Afrofuturism"
bbr.2046.d:0 "Despite Sun Ra’s message of peace, pacifism, and forgiveness, his allies in the radical coalition cannot make the same promise. Since their coup against the pro-Americanist regime, the various groups backing Sun Ra - the ABB, the UNIA, the NOI, and the TUUL - all have begun to violently get their revenge against both our nation’s non-Black population as well as any and all marks of the old order. With riots breaking out across the Black Belt as Pan-African militias from every corner of the radical spectrum rampage across the nation in search of retribution. Sun Ra has taken a firm stance against these acts of violence, but for now it seems that he can do little to stop this wave of mob rule. However, with this bloodshed and destruction has also come a sign of things to come - the cracks in the coalition have begun to show greatly with this surge in conflict, with even supposedly-allied paramilitaries firing on each other more than once. The nation is in chaos, the coalition is fracturing, and our national symbol is caught in the middle of warring groups fighting for our future. It would seem that only Sun Ra can save us now."
bbr.2046.a:0 "In due time, they will learn the true ways of Ra."

bbr.2047.t:0 "Peace Returns to the Black Belt"
bbr.2047.d:0 "With Sun Ra’s decision to fully align with just one sector of the fracturing radical coalition, many expected yet another surge of violence and outrage to spill out across the Black Belt. However, it would seem that the opposite is true, for despite Blount’s favoritism in pursuit of peace, the other factions have not taken up arms. Instead, they dutifully follow in Sun Ra’s footsteps, dedicated and all-trusting to his genius vision for our shared people, and pledging their loyalty to him over any government or single political party. This has miraculously kept the peace, and with Sun Ra’s message of peace reaching more and more of the masses, the growing pains of our new national movement have seemed to cease as well. Though the nation is far from stable or healed, it would seem that finally we are on the right track to our destiny."
bbr.2047.a:0 "Peace in our time at last."

bbr.2048.t:0 "We Were Kings, and We Will be Again"
bbr.2048.d:0 "Though our new Pan-African identity draws from many sources, the most important of all is ancient Egypt. Our ancestors along the Nile were among the first civilizations on Earth, building the pyramids and the Sphinx while nurturing a culture that would survive for millennia. This is our legacy - we are the heirs to the kings and pharaohs of the Old Kingdom, and we shall be those kings again! To fully embrace this new identity, our capital of Charleston has undergone a transformation unlike any other. Gone is the colonial hive of Charleston, for New Thebes now stands brilliantly in its place. With Neo-Egyptian and Afrofuturist architecture and art coming to dominate the refurbished city, we will build a capital fitting of our Cosmic Pharaoh and our celestial Egyptian-descended people. The glories of the Old Kingdom shall be made anew, all thanks to the guidance and genius of Le Sony’r Ra!"
bbr.2048.a:0 "We shall build a new cosmic pharohdom to rival the splendor of our ancestors."

bbr.2049.t:0 "A Celestial Discovery"
bbr.2049.d:0 "Thanks to the efforts of our burgeoning space program generously funded, perhaps even over-funded, by Sun Ra, we have made a tantalizing discovery. The Celestial Vizier Walter Samuel McAfee - our chief astronomer and science officer - has been using the latest telescope and astro-observational technology to scan the skies to learn more about our cosmic origins and our celestial destiny. In his latest report, Celestial Vizier McAfee has declared that he has discovered the 10th known moon of Saturn, our paradisiacal homeland out among the stars. This discovery has been marked as a good omen by Le Sony’r Ra and by the cult around him, with the government even going as far to declare this day a new national holiday while the moon has been named Ra after our national father and celestial guide himself. This news has had the entire nation abuzz, with space-themed parties and intergalactic-inspired celebrations breaking out across the Black Belt, and is sure to raise our spirits as we prepare for our eventual pilgrimage."
bbr.2049.a:0 "It must be an omen!"

bbr.2050.t:0 "The Saturnine Pilgrimage Begins"
bbr.2050.d:0 "In a mass-broadcasted and highly publicized event, the nation prepares for the first manned-rocket test in our space program’s history. In secret, we have tested rockets for years and over time we have clawed our way through the hard science to craft a safe, working rocket capable of holding a small crew and at least getting them into orbit. The rocket in question has been named the ‘Mandjet’ after the Boat of Millions of Years, which was the solar barque Ra is said to have traveled upon in Egyptian mythology, and is based upon design sourced from the Americans and the Germans that were perfected here in our cosmic realm. Along Florida's eastern coastline at the Cape of Ra, the launchsite prepares to send Robert Henry Lawrence Sr. and Carl C. McNair - the first two trained Afronauts selected from a team also including Afronauts Edward Dwight, Robert Henry Lawrence, and Guion Bluford - into space to be the first of our Pan-African peoples to grace the vacuum of the cosmos since Sun Ra’s arrival from Saturn. Though many fear that these brave men may not return, we wish them the best of luck as the countdown begins. May Sun Ra guide their souls to Afrofuture and safely back as they blast off into history."
bbr.2050.a:0 "We wish these brave Afronauts a safe trip as they blaze into the Afrofuture."

bbr.2051.t:0 "The Mandjet Disaster"
bbr.2051.d:0 "As the Mandjet blasted into the atmosphere, the crowd beneath it watched in awe while bathed in the glow of the roaring engines, but this beautiful, peaceful image would not last. After just a mere 73 seconds into its flight, the Mandjet near-instantly broke apart and exploded, sending bits of rocket and spacecraft hurtling towards the Cape of Ra and the water below. As the hopes and dreams of the Saturnine Pilgrimage rained down to Earth in a fiery rain, the people below watched in horror, but none were more distraught or ashamed than Sun Ra. In a public address, Sun Ra named the tragically killed afronauts Robert Henry Lawrence Sr. and Carl C. McNair as national heroes of our cosmic realm, and a monument to their glory have been built across the nation. However, this setback has not deterred our national father, for the Cosmic Pharaoh has decreed that this failure will only lead to future success. Though it will be some time before another rocket is ready to launch, we will take what we can learn from this tragedy and move on stronger as a people, together."
bbr.2051.a:0 "We must try again to reach our celestial destiny, in time."

bbr.2052.t:0 "Waiting on News from the Pilgrimage"
bbr.2052.d:0 "With the launch of the Mandjet being an undeniable success, you would think that many in the Black Belt would be rejoicing for this first successful step of the Saturnine Pilgrimage, but what should be a time of celebration has only seen apprehension, anxiety, fear, and worry. It has been days since the Mandjet first lifted off into the Afrofuture and the cosmos beyond, and it has been equally long since we had any sign of them. Afronauts Robert Henry Lawrence Sr. and Carl C. McNair have been seemingly lost to space, and with no signal or visual lock on their location, many have begun to fear the worst. The Cosmic Pharaoh Sun Ra has done his best to ease the worried minds of the people, but even with his reassurance, doubt stalks the nation. A second launch has been planned as a sort of search and rescue mission as well as the next step of the Pilgrimage, but it will be quite some time until another one is ready and another pair of Afronauts are trained. Until then, Sun Ra must ease the mind of the people as we stumble into the Afrofuture."
bbr.2052.a:0 "Perhaps they are still searching for Saturn?"

bbr.2053.t:0 "A Successful Trip Around the Planet"
bbr.2053.d:0 "Beating the odds and surprising the world, the maiden voyage of the Mandjet has been a success. Afronauts Robert Henry Lawrence Sr. and Carl C. McNair returned to Earth in their landing capsule safely and unharmed after achieving a stable orbit around the planet, and now are set to receive a hero’s welcome. The first humans in history to successfully return to space since our celestial inception, McNair and Lawrence are paragons of humanity of the highest order and shall be rewarded as such. Given the titles of ‘Intergalactic Afro-Pioneers,' they have become some of the most famous humans in the nation and in the wider world overnight and now shall help Cosmic Pharaoh Sun Ra and the Celestial Vizier McAfee guide the nation towards the next step of our Saturnine Pilgrimage. Though it shall be ages before we get to our true homeland, this first step has given us the courage and the reassurance to get there!"
bbr.2053.a:0 "A miracle of the cosmos ensured by Sun Ra! This is our first step towards Saturn!"

bbr.2054.t:0 "The Arkestra’s Newest Album"
bbr.2054.d:0 "The Arkestra of Sun Ra has released its newest album today - titled ‘We are in the Future’ - to critical acclaim and praise. Featuring jazz, blues, and funk influenced by both American and African sounds as well as Sun Ra’s own cosmic interests, the album has been lauded as one of the greatest musician compositions of the modern era. At over two hours long, this avante-garde journey through jazz is a non-stop sonic delight. However, Sun Ra was far from the only musician titan to grace the record, for with his immense influence and popularity, he was able to pull on musicians from across the Black Belt and beyond to aid him on this cosmic and sonic experiment. Featuring guest appearances from jazz, blues, and soul legends such as Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole, Alberta Hunter, Cab Colloway, Ethel Waters, Joe Williams, Slim Gaillard, Billy Eckstine, Fats Waller, Ivie Anderson, Mildred Bailey, Pearl Mae Bailey, Ida Cox, Duke Ellington, Adelaide Hall,  Carmen McRae, and Sarah Loise Vaughan, the best of the best of what our people have to offer musically collaborated together to make something magical. With copies flying off the shelves both domestically and internationally, Sun Ra has begun to organize a tour for the album while much of the profit from the album has been put into both the space program and our cultural initiatives to benefit our Pan-African people. With yet another chart-topping success, Sun Ra continues to dazzle both the political and musical worlds simultaneously without issue, and the world awaits what he will release next."
bbr.2054.a:0 "These sonic waves bring new joy and groove to all within our realm."

bbr.2055.t:0 "The Cosmic Tour of the Third Rock from the Sun"
bbr.2055.d:0 "Off the back of the success of the Arkestra’s album ‘We are in the Future,’ Sun Ra and his cosmic band have organized a world-wide music tour. Focusing on cities in Africa and the Black Diaspora regions such as the Caribbean and parts of North and South America while also planning to stop in some more diverse cities, this Cosmic Tour of the Saturnine Sons shall bring Sun Ra’s music to millions across the world. Along the way he is expected to play in Togo with the famed jazzman and veteran Kwassi Bruce while in Italy he is expected to play with experimenters of Futurist music Luigi Russolo and Francesco Pratella. All along the way, key acts and close friends such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Nat King Cole, and Billie Holiday are set to stand by Sun Ra throughout the entire tour as mainstays of the Arkestra, adding their immense talent to the already genius Sun Ra. Once again, Sun Ra has promised that most of the profits from this tour shall go into improving our nation at home, and with over 50 cities booked, we are sure to make a pretty penny or two. With Sun Ra and his Arkestra taking off from New Thebes to their first stop in Mexico City, the world waits eagerly for the sonic sounds of Sun Ra!"
bbr.2055.a:0 "The cosmic Afro-Futurist sound shall be heard across the globe!"

bbr.2056.t:0 "Space is the Place, the Movie"
bbr.2056.d:0 "Seeking to spread his cosmic message to the masses both within and outside the borders of the Black Belt, Sun Ra has funded and created a new movie to showcase his cosmic philosophy to the world. Called ‘Space is the Place’ after his infamous motto, the 85-minute science-fiction film showcases Sun Ra being stranded on an alien planet with his Arkestra after their recent tour. After getting their bearings, Sun Ra and his crew, all dressed in Afrofuturistic and Egyptian themed garb, decide to settle the Negro population on the planet, with Sun Ra using the power of his music to physically transport the Black race to the planet. All the while he is attempting to build this new colony, he must travel back and forth through time in order to win a card duel against a demonic pimp-overlord for the fate of the Black race. The film is certainly strange and avant-garde, but despite its oddities it has struck a chord with many, becoming the biggest blockbuster of the year. With theatres, both domestic and international, selling out showing after showing of ‘Space is the Place,’ Sun Ra has been overjoyed, for his vision and his truth is finally reaching the masses of the world, whether they know it to be true or not."
bbr.2056.a:0 "Space is indeed the place, and now all shall know it!"

bbr.2057.t:0 "The Afrofuturist International"
bbr.2057.d:0 "With Sun Ra’s open, cosmic, and Afrofuturist philosophy only growing more popular, he has seen in fit to call a world-wide Futurist and avant-garde meeting of scientists, artists, philosophers, and other public figures to come together to cooperate for the greater Futurist good, discussing art, theory, politics, music, humor, writing, and so much more. In attendance are many diverse and varied titans of the Futurist and avant-garde scenes, such as Benito Mussolini, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Friedrich Arturovich Zander, Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, Nikola Tesla, Edward Mukuka Nkoloso, Umberto Boccioni, Giacomo Balla, Natalia Goncharova, Buckminster Fuller, Hugo Gernsback, Carlo Carrà, Antonin Artaud, Joseph Stella, Karl Čapek, Aldous Huxley, Walt Disney, Eric Blair, Archibald Lowe, Herman Kahn, Jacque Fresco, Marshall McLuhan, Salvador Dali, Pablo Picasso, and Kwassi Bruce to name just a few. Though our methods, our specifics, our backgrounds, and our ideas all differ, we are all chasing towards some future paradise, and that is a goal we can all share. With Sun Ra as the calming, peaceful glue that binds this varied coalition of minds together, there is nothing humanity cannot achieve! With another meeting being planned for next year, all in attendance - even those who went in with apprehension and doubt - are now excited and wholly dedicated to this newfound sense of cooperation, or at least, that is what Sun Ra has told his people back home."
bbr.2057.a:0 "Together, we shall progress towards the infinite future!"

bbr.2058.t:0 "The Black Internationale"
bbr.2058.d:0 "With Sun Ra’s racialist, Black Supremacist, and Afrofuturist philosophy only growing more popular, he has seen it fit to call a world-wide Pan-African meeting of philosophers, politicians, theorists, thinkers, and more to come together to cooperate for the greater good of the Black race. Urging cooperation, peace, and unity between our disparate peoples, Sun Ra believes that if all true children of Africa work together, there is nothing we cannot achieve. In attendance are numerous titans of the Pan-African ideal, such as George Padmore, Kwame Nkrumah, François Duvalier, Louis de Gonzague Bobozo, Onyango Obama, Stanley Mathenge, Jean-Paul Sousatte, and many more, all rallied around Sun Ra and his guest of honor Marcus Garvey. Though our methods, our specifics, our backgrounds, and our ideas all differ, we are striving to do what is best for our people, our race, and our legacy, and that is a goal we can all share. With Sun Ra as the calming, peaceful glue that binds this varied coalition of minds together, there is nothing humanity cannot achieve! With another meeting being planned for next year, all in attendance - even those who went in with apprehension and doubt - are now excited and wholly dedicated to this newfound sense of cooperation, or at least, that is what Sun Ra has told his people back home."
bbr.2058.a:0 "Together, we shall uplift our chosen African race!"

bbr.2059.t:0 "A Banner for Our New Realm"
bbr.2059.d:0 "With the declaration of our new state, Sun Ra has petitioned the people to design a new flag for our cosmic realm. Though many designs were submitted, with even Sun Ra himself submitting his own design, only one can be chosen. What should be the banner of our new state and the symbol we rally behind along with Sun Ra?"
bbr.2059.a:0 "The Falcon of Ra on an orange background with sun rays will be the design."
bbr.2059.b:0 "An Ankh on a field of orange shall adorn our banner."
bbr.2059.c:0 "We choose the Sun on a black field with yellow sun rays."
bbr.2059.e:0 "The large golden Falcon of Ra with rays of sunlight and a red sun shall be our flag."
bbr.2059.f:0 "Go with the purple flag with the Falcon of Ra and the moons of Saturn."
bbr.2059.g:0 "We shall go with Sun Ra’s own submission of a fractured sun with black stars."

bbr.2060.t:0 "A New Possible Capital?"
bbr.2060.d:0 "With our recent military successes, our forces have secured Tennessee, and now the great city of Memphis is now under our control. Memphis is also the name of the old capital of ancient Egypt, and as such Sun Ra has taken a great interest in the city. He has proclaimed his desire to move the capital to Memphis to be in line with our heritage. There, he wished to build his own pyramid - a replica of the Great Pyramid of Giza - to serve as his new palace and as the new governmental center of the nation. Regardless of whether or not we choose to move the capital there, the Great Pyramid of Ra at Memphis is already being constructed in a Neo-Egyptian and Afrofuturist style, with the city being rebuilt to reflect this new aesthetic much like New Thebes. Now, the only question is should we move the capital there?"
bbr.2060.a:0 "To Memphis we go, to honor our ancestors!"
bbr.2060.b:0 "New Thebes has served us well. Go ahead with the construction but our capital shall not change."

bbr.2063.t:0 "The Cosmic Tables Have Turned"
bbr.2063.d:0 "Despite it not being an initial goal of our state or within the wider plan divined by the Cosmic Pharaoh Sun Ra, we have come to control the bulk of the lands that once belonged to the failed Union. With the carcass of America now within the celestial mesh of our new field of reeds, Sun Ra has become overjoyed, for this melting pot is the perfect place to witness his new open cosmic philosophy in action. With all of humanity being declared cosmic Africans by our intergalactic guide, we shall work to build a cohesive and cooperative utopia of the sub-races of the wider Pan-African identity. We are all Aaruites, and together we shall build a paradise as we strive to reach our shared Saturnine Afrofuture."
bbr.2063.a:0 "Together, side by side, we all shall reach our cosmic destiny."
bbr.2063.b:0 "Take this idea further and unite all of humanity within the Cosmic Realm!"

bbr.2064.t:0 "The Cosmic Tables Have Turned"
bbr.2064.d:0 "Despite it not being an initial goal of our state or within the wider plan divined by the Cosmic Pharaoh Sun Ra, we have come to control the bulk of the lands that once belonged to the failed Union. With the carcass of America now within the celestial mesh of our new field of reeds, Sun Ra has become overjoyed, for this melting pot is the perfect place to witness his new racial cosmic philosophy in action. It is the burden of our Afro-Saturnine people to guide the lower races of humanity to paradise before we chosen people ourselves make the pilgrimage to our cosmic utopia beyond the stars. On Saturn, only we chosen will find true enlightenment, but we can still improve life for all of our earthly kin along the way. We are the purest race, the first race, and the paragon of humanity both on Earth and in space. This is our burden, for as Sun Ra guides our true African people, we true Africans must now guide the misguided Americans."
bbr.2064.a:0 "Together, with the true Sons of Saturn at the helm, we will reach the Afrofuture."
bbr.2064.b:0 "Let all of humanity, even our lesser offshoots, reach the Afrofuture under our will."

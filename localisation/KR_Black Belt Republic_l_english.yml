This diverse array of pious pacifist are bonded by their shared emphasis on spiritual patriotism, a strong Christian identity, and conservative but socially responsbile capitalism, while rejecting racial identity and Socialism."
BBR_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Republican Army"
BBR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "The Republican Army - A grouping of Army Officials with more traditional American Ideals, the Republican Army is led by Charles Young and supported by a mixture of black officers, the middle-class and many whites still in the region who are not ODP members.

BBR_national_populist_party_long:0 "The Nation of Islam - The Nation of Islam is a radical black supremacist group best known for following a racialist and highly heretical variant of Islam that claims the "White Race" was created by a mad scientist named Yakub thousands of years ago and that the "Black Race" is the chosen people of Allah. Their leader Elijah Muhammad claims that NOI founder Wallace Fard Muhammad was God himself and that Elijah Muhammad is his appointed prophet on Earth, with Fard's sudden dissaparence leaving Elijah in charge. Outside the NOI Fard's dissaparence is a source of a multitude of conspiracy theories but nonetheless the NOI's paramilitary prowess, appeals to racial purity, guarantees of a minimum standard of living for members and promise to end all threats to Black Americans has made it one of the most powerful, and extreme, far-right organizations in Black America."

### Ideas ###
BBR_great_depression:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_great_depression_desc:0 "Since the collapse of the New York Stock Market in 1925, the United States has been gripped by the Great Depression. In addition to the massive economic woes plaguing America from this never-ending crisis, the Great Depression has given energy to both Long and Reed as they campaign against one another and the establishment."

BBR_black_monday:0 "The Great Depression"
BBR_black_monday_desc:0 "The Great Depression which has been gripping America for over a decade looked to be slowly recovering under the Hoover administration, though nowhere near fast enough. However, the recent collapse of the Berlin Stock Market has just made the Great Depression even worse. Only God and the next president know when this can be over."

BBR_black_monday2:0 "The Great Depression"

BBR_political_crisis:0 "Political Crisis"
BBR_political_crisis_desc:0 "The United States is in crisis. The Great Depression, which has been ravaging our nation for over a decade, has still not let up. Popular desperation has allowed the far-left Socialist Party of America and the far-right America First Party to gain strength in recent years. Others look to MacArthur and the Army as a way to solve both the depression and radicalization. Many worry that the United States could descend into civil war should our current situation not soon be resolved, or a radical presidential candidate win in the upcoming 1936 Elections."

BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea4:0 "Advancing Recovery from the Civil War"
BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea4_desc:0 "Government-run agencies have started to put people back to work, and some respectable businesses have reopened. The threat of mass starvation has passed, though it is not uncommon to see small hordes of orphans and elderly rooting through trash in the cities."

BBR_civil_war_aftermath_idea5_desc:0 "The scars of the war, visible just months ago, have largely faded from the country.

### NazBol Gang ###
BBR_abb:0 "The African Blood Brotherhood"
BBR_abb_desc:0 "The National Syndicalists of the ABB have managed to seize power from within the Unity League! This will be a century for both the black race and proletariat, as syndicalism shall be an expression of racial nationalism. The old capitalist class that once held us back will be crushed."
BBR_the_crusaders:0 "The Crusaders"
BBR_the_crusaders_desc:0 "The Crusader has been the newsletter of the ABB since its founding, and with the ABB's dominance, it will need loyalists to carry out its will. The Crusaders shall be made up of the most devoted of the ABB's paramilitary and the Crusader itself will be more widely distributed with tales of their benevolence."
BBR_racial_expropriation:0 "Racial Expropriation"
BBR_racial_expropriation_desc:0 "While we can work with other national proletariat groups, it is clear that within its own land, the Black population needs to own the wealth that had been taken from them. It was stolen by the foriegn capitalist class, which has repressed Black labor within the nation. As such, non-Black members of the upper-middle and upper-classes will have their wealth repossesed by the state, which represents the Black Proletariat."
BBR_hamitic_league_of_the_world:0 "Hamitic League of the World"
BBR_hamitic_league_of_the_world_desc:0 "The Hamitic League of the World is aware of a very simple fact: the Negro race is the greatest race the world has ever known. Further, Black civilization is far older than Whites have claimed. Its membership numbers must be expanded among both Black and mixed-race peoples. It needs funding to promote its views among the populace and overseas to promote our legitimacy, with the League becoming a predominant means of outreach to the black community both here and abroad."
BBR_children_of_the_sun:0 "The Children of the Sun"
BBR_children_of_the_sun_desc:0 "We are the descendents of great civilzations including Egypt, Greece, and Ethiopia, and yet this knowledge is supressed by the White Bourgeosie and their collaborators at every turn. It is time to expand schools and colleges with these new teachings and to spread the word throughout the ABB of our ancient origins, so that unity and pride amongst our people will be absolute."
BBR_the_black_pharoah:0 "The Black Pharaoh"
BBR_the_black_pharoah_desc:0 "We have established a proper state, founded around defending our ancient heritage and subduing the capitalist class. The title of a Black Pharoah shall be given to Duse Mohamad to solidify his status as the sole executive authority of the Black proletariat and their history. At Cyril Briggs' urging, the title shall be passed through party members devoted to the cause and as such, marks the first National Republican Pharaohdom."
BBR_national_syndicalism:0 "Black National Syndicalism"
BBR_national_syndicalism_desc:0 "We must ensure the economy is organized in such a way as to represent not just the workers, but our people's very spirit. We shall establish loyal unions and guilds representing either workers or professions whose efforts are protected and directed by the loyal, professional Black producerist class."
BBR_work_communes:0 "Work Communes"
BBR_work_communes_desc:0 "A means of organizing more unskilled and still unorganized members of the Black Nation so they may contribute to society and secure for themselves employment is challenging. It is certainly not impossible. An administrative, government-established union will be put to use overseeing work projects we desperately need done. It will use either the unemployed or those in less productive sectors of the economy who could be shifted elsewhere."
BBR_black_mercantilism:0 "Black Mercantilism"
BBR_black_mercantilism_desc:0 "Due to the oppression of the Children of the Sun, we have been unable to build wealth in the same manner as others, but having our own mercantilism will solve this. The former merchants of our nation will be organized to work on behalf of the people under state-run corporations."
BBR_state_quotas:0 "State Quotas"
BBR_state_quotas_desc:0 "As our state is reluctant to use wages to motivate the people, nationalist and socialist goals have served to do the job. Sometimes this is not enough however, so we will set state quotas on bureaucrats in industry and agriculture to ensure maximum production."
BBR_black_nobility:0 "Black Nobility"
BBR_black_nobility_desc:0 "In taking back our rightful place, we must look to the past for inspiratation. A black nobility once existed that created much of civilization before its legacy was covered up. We will recreate the Black Nobility with titles to loyal party officials and the exceptional. This will inspire the socialist upper-class and bound them to our nation while making them responsible for certain localities."

### Totalists ###
BBR_the_vanguard:0 "The Socialist Vanguard"
BBR_the_vanguard_desc:0 "The Vanguard Socialists have won the election and are now in a position to organize a radically progressive, collectivist society under the guidance of a strong leader."
BBR_red_army:0 "Top-Down Revolutionary Army"
BBR_red_army_desc:0 "The militias were effective for an initial uprising, but to continue to face professional armies, we will need one of our own. It will need discipline and to be answerable to the state alone. As such, the militias will be organized into a true military, without reactionary influence."
BBR_league_of_revolutionary_struggle:0 "The League of Revolutionary Struggle"
BBR_league_of_revolutionary_struggle_desc:0 "While our military is organized, we still need intelligence services and propaganda. The League of Revolutionary Struggle will be made into government agency in charge of both, gaining our support among the populace and training internal agents to investigate treachery."
BBR_military_build_up:0 "Building Our Own Arms"
BBR_military_build_up_desc:0 "The naive would have us focus solely on civilian investments, but military industries are no less important. In fact, they are more-so, as we require them to defend the nation. Our planned economy is superior in building such goods and industries, as we will set aside areas to be developed into military factories."
BBR_rapid_nationalization:0 "Rapid Nationalization"
BBR_rapid_nationalization_desc:0 "The economy must come under the command of the government at once if we are to develop true socialism. As such, major industries will be nationalized and brought under the control of the government, capitalists be damned."
BBR_expand_the_party:0 "Expanding the Party"
BBR_expand_the_party_desc:0 "We will pour more energy into gaining recruits among the population and require left-leaning trade unions to become party members at once, for the party represents the worker."
BBR_black_trade_unity_league:0 "Trade Union Unity League"
BBR_black_trade_unity_league_desc:0 "The Collectivist-Syndicalists under Harry Haywood and his Haywood-Fosterite followers have come to dominance, and thus our Republic will know true radicalism and, in the process, true liberation."
BBR_hammer_and_hoe:0 "The Hammer and the Hoe"
BBR_hammer_and_hoe_desc:0 "The economy must come under the absolute control of the TUUL, with each TUUL region being responsible for collectivizing the industrial and agricultural sectors at once while undoing bourgousie influence such as abolishing monetary wages in favor of supply provisions."
BBR_agrarian_revolution:0 "The Agrarian Revolution"
BBR_agrarian_revolution_desc:0 "Agriculture must be advanced at once. Collectivization must be intensified, capital goods for farms acquired and built, quotas set, and research funded into Agricultural advancements. Due to their resistance, former landlords will be liquidated."
BBR_marxian_nationalism:0 "Marxian Nationalism"
BBR_marxian_nationalism_desc:0 "Most forms of 'Nationalism' are sadly reactionary, but it need not stay that way. Local cultural nationalisms can be respected as a tool of liberation, so long as class solidarity comes first, so administrations for different regions will be established."
BBR_total_liberation:0 "Total Liberation"
BBR_total_liberation_desc:0 "We've taken the reigns of the economy, but that does not mean the culture has changed enough. Let us destroy the remnants of imperialism and reaction in a nationwide campaign to create a truly socialist culture in which class struggle and revolutionary action is the prime mover and remaining reactionaries in society are stopped from spreading their poison."
BBR_anti_imperialism:0 "Radical Anti-Imperialism"
BBR_anti_imperialism_desc:0 "We must confront the imperialist powers that have placed a target on our back and have subjugated much of the world under capitalism. Army recruitment, martial preparedness, anti-imperialist education, the liquidation of remaining imperialists, and aggressive training are all of grave necessity."
BBR_black_communist_league:0 "New Communist League"
BBR_black_communist_league_desc:0 "The New Communist League of Ben Davis has come to power and seeks to build socialism in America under a single central party, which they call 'Black Jacobinism' after the French model. Their biggest hope is that they may help advance world socialism."
BBR_rapid_industrialization:0 "Industrializing the Land"
BBR_rapid_industrialization_desc:0 "We must put industrialization of the nation first if we are to be a leading socialist economy. We should export our raw resources in return for capital goods from the Internationale, and have our planners place emphasis on producing new factories and nationalizing older ones for a true economy of scale."
BBR_left_military_police:0 "Jacobin Military Police"
BBR_left_military_police_desc:0 "Our military should be praised for the work it has done so far, but that does not mean reactionary influence is not present. A Jacobin Military Police will be geared towards monitoring for potential disloyalty within, and sometimes outside, the military. Further, they will handle military trials, increasing discipline and stability in the process."
BBR_the_southern_upsurge:0 "The Socialist Southern Upsurge"
BBR_the_southern_upsurge_desc:0 "The Party needs more support at once, and the reactionaries need to be culled. A campaign for Southern Socialism will emphasize joining the party while reporting local reactionaries to the authorities and removing them from political and economic influence. This will help our party grow at a greater rate."
BBR_a_party_with_a_state:0 "A Party with a State"
BBR_a_party_with_a_state_desc:0 "While party membership has increased, it is time to finalize the party's control. All non-purged members of the nation will be registered with the New Communist League, and our bureaucracy will be organized so that party ranking and position are one and the same, for the Party is the People."
BBR_total_employment:0 "State Employment"
BBR_total_employment_desc:0 "With the heights of the economy controlled by the NCL and all members of society being NCL members it is time to end unemployment and ensure all contribute to socialism. Full employment will be required and workers placed in areas that best suit the needs of the state, with the state finalizing central economic planning in the process."
BBR_sp_centralists:0 "Socialist Party Centralists"
BBR_sp_centralists_desc:0 "The Socialist Party Centralist Faction has come to power under James Ford and his so-called 'Browderist-Fordist' faction. Supporting a centrally guided economy, strong leadersip, and limited reforms, the faction is considered the least ideological of the Vanguardists."
BBR_workers_market:0 "The Workers Market"
BBR_workers_market_desc:0 "While capitalist enterprises must be ended, the worker's market will be tolerated for the good of the nation. With price controls in place, workers and family businesses that do not grow too large will be allowed to sell their goods to one another while government control of large businesses will be mandatory."
BBR_working_the_bourgeosie:0 "Have the Bourgeosie Bend the Knee"
BBR_working_the_bourgeosie_desc:0 "Capitalist ownership must end, and so it will. But, members of the bourgeosie and middle-class do have experience in management and setting prices.

BBR_unite_the_left_desc:0 "The left is still sadly unstable, with some socialists attacking us for being too radical in our methods, while those on our left call us sellouts.

BBR_purge_radicals:0 "Purge Radicals"
BBR_purge_radicals_desc:0 "Despite our best attempts, the most radical communists still hold out against us, as do the remaining nationalist and NOI cells.

BBR_required_unionization:0 "Unionize Yesterday"

BBR_counter_reactionaries_desc:0 "While our nation was founded on progress, reactionaries sought to abuse the novelty of the country for their own ends.

In return for their wealth, they will get some extra workers coupons in the future."
BBR_class_consciousness:0 "Southern Class Consciousness"

BBR_approach_local_socialists:0 "Approach Local Socialists"
BBR_approach_local_socialists_desc:0 "While we do not see eye-to-eye on all issues, the socialist's influence among the working class is obvious, and we must credit their militias support of the nation. Thankfully, their moderate wing can be won over via negotiations with unions, increased wages, and lower working hours for workers."
BBR_approach_the_afp:0 "Working with the AFP"
BBR_approach_the_afp_desc:0 "Likely the most fervent supporters of our cause are the local AFP supporters and militias in the area, with our regional AFP being more unambiguously pro-Black than the national AFP. By encouraging party ties and providing rural support, we can cement our support among them and farmers."

BBR_crush_race_separatists_desc:0 "Pockets of Race Nationalists still exist throughout the nation, namely the Klan, NDWL and ODP among whites and the NOI, UNIA and African Blood Brotherhood among blacks.

BBR_deport_anarchists_desc:0 "The most extreme left radicals, namely the Fosterites under Haywood and Black Jacobins under Davis, are still causing problems in their outposts, plotting against our government and attacking perceived class traitors and capitalists.

BBR_american_recruitment_effort_desc:0 "We need soldiers now if we are going to hold our own against our newfound enemies.

BBR_integration_through_service:0 "Integration through Patriotism"
BBR_integration_through_service_desc:0 "Our army command is still reluctant to adopt full integration to not only the military, but the country, believing that race-relations are not strong enough.

BBR_american_traditions:0 "American Traditions"
BBR_american_traditions_desc:0 "While some in our nation associate America unequivocally with race hatred this is not true, as race-extremists attempted to destroy and betray the American Nation.

BBR_fair_play:0 "Economic Fair Play"
BBR_fair_play_desc:0 "The issue is not, as the socialists view it, that Capitalism is inherently evil, but that it has come to be dominated by too few men without scruples. By passing anti-trust laws, further regulation of major companies to prevent price-gouging and inheritance, and progressive taxation, we can level the playing field for those attempting to compete in the marketplace."
BBR_paternal_economics:0 "For the Public Good"
BBR_paternal_economics_desc:0 "While leveling the playing field was helpful, it is not enough. We must go a stop further and provide minimum wage laws, a Federal Security commission for economic stability, and the nationalization of new federal lands and resources.

BBR_captain_at_the_helm_desc:0 "While it is important for a democratic outlet in the legislative branch to provide for the people, it's equally as important for a strong executive to provide stability, security and unity to their nation. General 'Captain' Young and his military clique will steer for a forward-thinking executive office that will see our nation the most prosperous in the world."
BBR_ally_long:0 "Union State Outreach"
BBR_ally_long_desc:0 "The American Union State is not perfect by any means but it is at least less hostile to us than syndicalists who view us as usurping black socialism and western powers desiring to occupy us. Perhaps we can work a deal with them to recognize our territory, and potential reintegration down the line?"

Jones' Peace Party has pulled through in the election, with their appeals to pacifism, tolerance and Christian morality appealing to even voters who view some of their specific tenants as unorthodox. The New Republic shall be united with the message of Peace!"
BBR_cash_only:0 "Cash Only"
BBR_cash_only_desc:0 "It is time to end the tyranny of pretend currency called 'credit' and the thrift associated with it.

Meanwhile we will give a tax break to community banks based on this model."
BBR_modesty_codes:0 "Modesty Codes"
BBR_modesty_codes_desc:0 "Many have given into vices such as alcoholism and cheating that destroy not only them but their families and society at large, something we are now in a position to legislate out of existence.

BBR_collective_management:0 "Encourage Collective Management"
BBR_collective_management_desc:0 "We understand that supporting capitalism need not be at odds with communities. Collective management of properties, businesses and other profitable ventures should be encouraged via a tax credit, with a larger reward for those businesses who use the money saved from collective management and communal living to sell at lower prices to our citizens when possible."
BBR_economic_independence:0 "Economic Independence"
BBR_economic_independence_desc:0 "Stopping the reliance on loans and banks was a good start but still there are too many individuals and communities who are economically dependent on unneeded ventures when energies could be directed towards truly productive activities.

BBR_feed_the_poor:0 "Feed the Poor"
BBR_feed_the_poor_desc:0 "With much of money saved from ending economic dependence increasingly going to communities and churches it is time to further help those whom Jesus said would always be with us, the poor.

BBR_anti_corruption_campaign_desc:0 "It is no surprise that with the chaotic and sudden start of our Republic that corruption remains an issue, with many bribing bureaucrats to 'speed things along' or look the other way.

BBR_multi_racial_churches:0 "Multi-Racial Congregations"
BBR_multi_racial_churches_desc:0 "Sadly despite the power of religion in unifying many churches remain separated on the basis of race. We must coordinate with local pastors to encourage interracial tolerance and yes even congregations, and encourage whites to visit black churches! All churches that fulfill this goal will gain bargaining power within the NCC."
BBR_power_of_faith:0 "The Power of Faith"
BBR_power_of_faith_desc:0 "If there is a universal empowerment available to all it is in faith.

BBR_reject_races:0 "Reject All Racialism"
BBR_reject_races_desc:0 "It is not enough to tolerate one another on the basis of race, but to abolish the category all together. There is no Black or White Race in the Bible, making the category meaningless.

BBR_spiritual_patriotism:0 "Spiritual Patriotism"
BBR_spiritual_patriotism_desc:0 "With the old racialism destroyed in favor of faith, we need to cement our national identity to unify those within our borders.

BBR_calm_racial_tensions:0 "Calm Racial Tensions"
BBR_calm_racial_tensions_desc:0 "While legally whites and blacks have equal rights under our Republic that certainly does not mean that they enjoy always cordial relations.

BBR_rural_schools:0 "Rural Schools"

BBR_expand_nnbl_desc:0 "The NNBL is the backbone of large scale Black Business in America, though it could not operate in the South with great ease.

BBR_lower_insurance_prices:0 "More Affordable Insurance"
BBR_lower_insurance_prices_desc:0 "Insurance has been a longtime struggle of Black Americans, with many resorting to mutual aid types societies.

BBR_fine_hate_groups:0 "Disarm Extremists"
BBR_fine_hate_groups_desc:0 "While militants stand fervently by their rights to firearms this is little more than a ruse that gives them an opening to enact violence on those they disapprove of or attempt to overthrow the government as they already have.

### Events ###

bbr.1.t:0 "A State Under Siege!"
bbr.1.d:0 "The Black Belt has broken free of the iron fist of the Old Democratic Party and the NDWL but the situation is far from under control and we will need to defend ourself from the Constitutional Republican of America! Already groups ranging from syndicalists to liberals to nationalists have pledged loyalty to the new state but it is clear each wishes to dominate it. With W.E.B as the appointed president by a small convention made up largely of SPA leaders hoping to appeal to both the center and the left, a rocky road is ahead of us. The first question is whether or not to enact a draft of black citizens in order to defend the Republic which while messy may be needed to defend our, and their, new freedoms. Some of the SPA including DuBois are not enthusiastic about the idea but our military leaders are pushing us to do it out of fear of certain death if we do not."
bbr.1.a:0 "Enact a Draft"
bbr.1.b:0 "Publicly Oppose a Draft"

amcivwar.1312.t:0 "Our own units?"
amcivwar.1312.d:0 "In our struggle for independence, some have suggested we copy the unit styles of our foes. This is nonsense. We are our own country now, and we will have our own units as well!"
amcivwar.1312.a:0 "Distance ourselves from the CAR"

bbr.2.t:0 "Reinforcements Arrive"
bbr.2.d:0 "Syndicalist's and Liberals in nearby territories have identified with the Black Belt's fight against the CAR and their current socialist leanings, arriving to aid in any way they can. With these groups no longer needing to be underground it has afforded us direct aid and a chance to better arm them. However, it also means the CAR has less internal dissent to deal with, putting more pressure on us to defend our territory. As a result the SPA radicals are pressuring us to ask for additional troops from the CSA, although this would give their faction additional influence."
bbr.2.a:0 "Very well"
bbr.2.b:0 "We are fine as is"

bbr.3.t:0 "Elijah Muhammad Arrives"
bbr.3.d:0 "A Group with chapters throughout the nation, the Nation of Islam was largely based out of the North until it caught wind of the increasing instability of the Black Belt. Barely tolerated by the CSA and AUS both out of hope they would aid rebels in CAR and out of fear moving against a prominent pro-Black group (albeit a reactionary one) would alienate potential black recruits, they have increasing sent funding and rebels in the South. With the emergence of the Black Belt Revolt Elijah Muhammad and his entourage have arrived in the territory with a large number of supporters trickling in. The rumors that he also has allies within, of all places, the Young Klan due to shared collaboration as relating to racial separation was part of the reason he was confident he and his men could safetly arrive has not endeared him to our government."
bbr.3.a:0 "A necessary evil perhaps"

bbr.4.t:0 "Nationalist Campaign!"
bbr.4.d:0 "The Universal Negro Improvement Association and the Nation of Islam have agreed to collaborate in what is being nicknamed a Nationalist Campaign, which they call a Negro Liberation Campaign, with the Moorish People's Temple despite their previously tense relationship in competing for the support of right-wing black nationalists. They advocate for ending conflict with the NDWL, stating that the liberal and syndicalist ideologies the other ideologies represent is more incongruent with the needs of the young Republic than the white race nationalists whom can be convinced to stick to 'their territory', and that Black Americans should look East, not West, for unity. This is obviously dangerous to our government's desire to finish off the ODP and work with local whites but they continue to pledge troops and commanders so long as the conflict goes on, as they say this does not mean they will accept bending the knee to any white faction either. Left Radicals such Paul Robeson and Harry Haywood are nonetheless calling on us to end the 'reactionary threat' now and instead rely on socialist supporters, stating that the Black Reactionary is a snake in our garden waiting to strike, with  saying they are potentially . Others are reluctant, noting that their support is massively important and we are in no position to oppose them, even if turning a blind eye will allow them to push up their recruitment numbers. The national syndicalist African Blood Brotherhood in particular says we should not shut down Black Nationalists while our Republic still needs support."
bbr.4.a:0 "Tolerate them"
bbr.4.b:0 "End them now"

bbr.5.t:0 "Garvey Denounces Us"
bbr.5.d:0 "From Liberia, Marcus Garvey has denounced the arrest of American UNIA leader James R. Stewart and NOI leader Elijah Muhammad, claiming we are keeping the 'hostage' and that our government has sold out to socialists and Jews. We are feeling the heat of cracking down on the nationalists as young men refuse to sign up for the army and nationalists cause internal damage. With the even more radical NOI calling for war we may have bit off more than we can chew. The African Blood Brotherhood is the only wing of our party that has somewhat cordial relationships with these groups and their followers, and under Duse Muhammad and Cyril Briggs they are offering to undo the 'damage' our government has done if given top cabinet and military positions. Those whom view the ABB as ultra-nationalists in socialist clothing or as a bizarre cult itself claim we should refuse but other SPA members claim that is the only way our government could hope to overcome our enemies."
bbr.5.a:0 "No, we stay the course"
bbr.5.b:0 "Appoint the ABB"

###ABB IN POWER###
bbr.6.t:0 "Nationalists Released!"
bbr.6.d:0 "The Nationalists we imprisoned have been released by the African Blood Brotherhood after they agreed to be loyal to the government and cease advocating for an Old Democratic alliance. In return, they have been given voting positions in an expanded Congress as well, which as a unicameral congress makes them heavily influential to the annoyance of some other left radicals, although they have vowed not to introduce legislation that would risk undoing their de facto 'parole'. Meanwhile the ABB has sent written works of their organs, the Crusader and the Hamitic League of the World, to new recruits and officers, increasing their membership roster from members of the military."
bbr.6.a:0 "Solve one problem, create another"

bbr.7.t:0 "Duse Muhammad Elected!"
bbr.7.d:0 "Introducing sudden legislation for a snap election, the ABB has put forward their Executive Heads, Duse Muhammad and Cyril Briggs, as new candidates to run the government, calling for an on-the-spot election in Congress while some left syndicalist leaders such as Paul Robeson, Harry Haywood and Ben Davis were called for a meeting with CSA officers and representatives. With the backing of the National Syndicalists, the newly appointed Nationalists and a small number of syndicalists whom agreed they were preferable to the current government, he was elected. DuBois sees this as little more than what virtually every other political faction views it as, a coup. The head of our military, General Charles 'Captain' Young, is having none of the most recent bout of government incompetence following this coup by extremists, saying that if DuBois backs him and his military faction by using his emergency powers to give Young executive powers and deliver him SPA backing he will remove the coup leaders from power and stabilize the ongoing conflict so it doesn't swallow the Republic."
bbr.7.a:0 "Appoint Young"
bbr.7.b:0 "It's not right"

bbr.8.t:0 "ABB in Power!"
bbr.8.d:0 "The African Blood Brotherhood has seized control of the government and has begun to remove oppositional members of Congress from office. A most recent article by ABB intellectual leader Cyril Briggs has called on the Black Belt to join the ABB as soon as possible to aid the cause, and they are currently pressuring remaining socialists to convert by force, jailing those who don't. This has most controversially lead to an arrest warrent for A. Philip Randolph, a reformist SPA leader who has since fled the country for a more socialist friendly one."
bbr.8.a:0 "Stay the Course!"

bbr.8000.t:0 "Potential Allies"
bbr.8000.d:0 "The so-called 'Red Totalists' is a loose grouping of left vanguardists who mutually dislike one another, and with the IWW and left-wing SPA in the region they make up the left revolutionary forces in the region. Despite our proclaimed devotion to anti-imperialism and worker liberation, our policies so far have left us controversial in these corners, who are demanding we show our devotion to the revolution by sending supplies to the Commune of France at once. Likewise, they are denouncing our 'state capitalist' policies and request greater autonomy for the syndicate unions, although we believe we could win over the Red Totalists if we give into some of their demands, followed by gradually absorbing and retiring their current leadership. Of course, this would be costly in the short-term, causing some to float the idea of brining in UNIA to provide support in their place and immediently move to absorb the Revolutionary Left as a whole, in one swift strike. Briggs himself advises working more closely with the left, despite Duse Muhammad's former connections with UNIA."
bbr.8000.a:0 "Work with UNIA"
bbr.8000.b:0 "Work with the Left"

bbr.8001.t:0 "The White Proletariat"
bbr.8001.d:0 "While our recent policies have left us with repossessing many businesses and lands owned by middle and upper-class whites to be instead controlled by the state or given to allies, there is a controversy regarding the 'white proletariat'. Cyril Briggs views them as a potential revolutionary force, and believes we should leave them as are to work alongside black workers with so long as they recognize this is a Black State, and do not attempt to climb the ranks internally. Likewise, he would be willing to sponsor them to move to revolutionary nations that are majority white so long as they are allies. The right-wing of the ABB on the other hand, while willing to ally and support white revolutionary nations abroad, view the domestic white proletariats and farmers in our region as having built their wealth on the back of whites, and think we should possess much of their existing wealth and lands, and place many of those who may cause problems, or can not afford to have their wealth possessed state communes to work alongside other reactionaries."
bbr.8001.a:0 "Adopt Briggsism"
bbr.8001.b:0 "Adopt the Right-Wing ABB view"

bbr.8002.t:0 "The Black Pharoah"
bbr.8002.d:0 "Duse Muhammad has been revealed as the Black Pharoah, a title given to the Head of State of the Black State and the head of the ABB. Despite the name, it officially is a Republican title that is passed down via election among Party Elites, although some are wondering how seriously the title should be taken and if Mohamed Ali should still behave as a Party Leader or keep himself out of the limelight and built up in a near religious manner to help build a Civic Religion modeled on the ABB's conception of Ancient Egypt."
bbr.8002.a:0 "That would be too far"
bbr.8002.b:0 "Take the Title more literally"

bbr.8003.t:0 "Greece Denounces our Claims"
bbr.8003.d:0 "Greece has reacted to our claims with ridicule, claiming that our attempts to claim the historical world are 'nonsense' and practically daring us to try to take Egypt and Greece. Naturally the ABB is outraged, and demands we declare war at once."
bbr.8003.a:0 "Declare War"
bbr.8003.b:0 "We Wait"

bbr.8004.t:0 "Fate of the Black bourgeoisie"
bbr.8004.d:0 "Until now, we have kept the Black bourgeoisie who have not resisted us somewhat intact, with their largest enterprises (and incomes) now being officially state owned properties with them managing it on our behalf under the new state corporations and syndicates. However with the handing out of titles and state properties some are wondering if we should extend these priviledges to members of the Black bourgeoisie who appear loyal to us to increase their loyalty and take advantage of their managerial skills, or if we should focus on empowering only long-time party members, in the process weakening the old bourgeoisie in favor of pure party rule."
bbr.8004.a:0 "Include them"
bbr.8004.b:0 "Exclude them"

bbr.8005.t:0 "Robert Church Jr. Killed"
bbr.8005.d:0 "The Crusaders have reported that Robert Church Jr. has been killed due to his connections to the New Republican Party and his funding of 'liberal militants'. A wealthy businessman who inherited a prominent savings bank from his father, it was one of the wealthiest organizations in the National Negro Business League, which is currently being dissolved and peeled apart by the Crusaders and our militants, making Church's death the latest in a series of killings of wealthy blacks who oppose the ABB and leaving his assets in our hands."
bbr.8005.a:0 "A Success"

bbr.8006.t:0 "Faith in Education"
bbr.8006.d:0 "Despite our best efforts which include illegalizing the Peace Party and arresting the charlatan Father Divine, the more mainstream Christian Churces continue to survive and even thrive despite some turning against it in favor of our National Mythos or even socialist materialism. This has lead to pushes in the ABB to emphasize discrediting Christianity in schools in favor of what the ABB views the natural faith of Black Culture, which is a seemingly strange mixture of materialism and appeals to more ancient traditions the ABB claims belongs to Blacks."
bbr.8006.a:0 "A Great Initiative"
bbr.8006.b:0 "Yes, and squeeze the churches"

### Nationalists Tolerated ###

bbr.9.t:0 "Nationalists Parade Treaty!"
bbr.9.d:0 "In response to the ongoing casualties of the war, the Nationalists claim they have a way of ending the war in short order, having supposedly secured a treaty with the CAR leadership, especially the ODP and Young Klan. Claiming that the CAR and Black Belt have a shared interest in standing against 'Race-mixing, financial masters and Jewish Power' they are calling on our government to appoint their coalition to power to end the war! Outside their circles their calls have been decisive, with some believing this to be essentially treason, others viewing them as racial elitists themselves selling out our moral cause and finally many viewing this as an opportunity to end the war even if they don't agree with the Nationalists personal views. With the CAR making sure to make civilian casualties against our population devastating when possible to put down the revolt once and for all, many are fearful of what and who they will lose if they do not accept. The left-wing of the SPA of course still desires them imprisoned for their treachery."
bbr.9.a:0 "We can do nothing"
bbr.9.b:0 "Arrest their leaders"

bbr.10.t:0 "March on [BBR.GETCAPITAL]"
bbr.10.d:0 "The Nationalists have decided to march on the congressional capital to show their dissatisfaction with the ongoing conflict in a call for peace and a new alliance across race-nationalist lines which they claim will end in not just Black prosperity but a "Black-American Empire". Claiming that we had and have a moral obligation to accept the terms of their treaty for 'the sake of saving Black lives' their numbers have continued to swell among those enamored with their many promises. Even worse, our intelligence operations tell us they have received supplies and support from sections of the ODP and Young Klan to aid them in this endeavor. The SPA and much of the military leadership are of course furious at this development and recommend routing them at the march, although this would be costly during a time of war. In response, General Charles Young has offered to not only end the threat at the March but if appointed as a regent implement policies to account for these loses and create a more battle ready state while continuing to end the national emergency of the Nationalist insurgency."
bbr.10.a:0 "We can't afford to stop them by force"
bbr.10.b:0 "Route them"
bbr.10.c:0 "Empower Young"

bbr.11.t:0 "Nationalist March Succeeds"
bbr.11.d:0 "The Nationalists marched on the capital today armed to the teeth and with a large following of thousands of supporters whilst most of our fighting men were busy on the front lines. DuBois, the SPA and many liberals in Congress evacuated in response and claimed they would return to avenge the backstabbing UNIA and NOI. Despite their cries however the Nationalists claimed success and called on an end to the war, with only the African Blood Brotherhood and a small handful of liberals remaining from the Old Congress after they had taken power."
bbr.11.a:0 "We are in their hands now"

### Nationalists Take Power ###

bbr.12.t:0 "Leadership Election"
bbr.12.d:0 "The Nationalists may have taken power but they have not settled the question of the dominant power in their Congress. While UNIA has a larger number of followers the NOI manages to compensate for its sizeable militia and increased fanaticism among those who do believe in the 'Prophet', Elijah Muhammad. Furthermore, the UNIA is suffering from a lack of united leadership itself as their actual leader, Marcus Garvey, is still in Liberia building an UNIA organization there. With the NOI appealing to their militancy and clear leadership and the UNIA to their more palatable platform to the public, it was a near deadlock in the Congress. Eventually they both appealed to the remaining nationalist-leaning members of Congress whom hadn't fled with the socialists to use their remaining influence to act as kingmaker and broker a backroom deal on each of their behalf's. With Wilfred Adolphus Domingo as the leading negotiator and diplomat between them, only one could come out on top."
bbr.12.a:0 "Appoint the NOI"
bbr.12.b:0 "Appoint the UNIA"

### UNIA Takes Power ###

bbr.1200.t:0 "Mission from UNIA"
bbr.1200.d:0 "UNIA has been growing its influence within our nation and is using its diplomatic connections to push for unification with the Black Belt. Marcus Garvey, head of the Liberia-UNIA is demanding that we comply, and the funding he has received has given him his own 'African Legion' militia. Naturally, UNIA promises us rewards if we comply and threatens us with force if we do not."
bbr.1200.a:0 "Comply"
bbr.1200.b:0 "Resist"

bbr.1201.t:0 "Return of Garvey"
bbr.1201.d:0 "Liberia has caved to our demands! With our mission to Liberia being a success thanks to the efforts of UNIA in both nations, the original founder of UNIA and greatest promoter of Black Nationalism in the world, Marcus Garvey, has returned to retake the mantel as the leader of the organization after he was deported from the country by the FBI. As James Stewart has officially been standing in for him, he will have to comply in return for being named the heir to Garvey."
bbr.1201.a:0 "A Great Day"

bbr.1202.t:0 "Return of Garvey"
bbr.1202.d:0 "Liberia has refused our demands! Marcus Garvey and his African Legion and UNIA is in exile after being pushed out by Liberian government and has returned home to retake the mantel as the leader of the organization after he was deported from the country by the FBI. As James Stewart has officially been standing in for him, he will have to comply in return for being named the heir to Garvey, who promises that Liberia will pay for its treachery."
bbr.1202.a:0 "At least he survived"

bbr.1203.t:0 "Conquest of America"
bbr.1203.d:0 "We have taken the United States! Naturally, we have few citizens in this region who qualify as pure Black citizens and we expect massive resistance if we attempt to hold it. As such we are being pressured by the cabinet to release the United States under a White Separatist Faction named the Young Klan, a group of White Nationalists who have worked with Black Nationalists before and promise to enforce racial laws that agree with ours as well as an alliance and payments. Of course, we could attempt to dominate the region directly and use its resources for a Black Empire of sorts."
bbr.1203.a:0 "Release the US"
bbr.1203.b:0 "We hold it"

bbr.1204.t:0 "Status of the NOI"
bbr.1204.d:0 "While the NOI were our allies in the early days of the coup it is clear that they are no longer needed and that they still have designs on ruling the nation. As such, with our cornering of political power, we will either have a deal with them to give them local autonomy in return for ending their national ambitions and political party or crush them."
bbr.1204.a:0 "Crush Them"
bbr.1204.b:0 "Cut a Deal"

bbr.1205.t:0 "Young Klan Offers"
bbr.1205.d:0 "The faction of the Young Klan that has favored working with the Black Nationalists have reacted to our recent racial policies with mixed results, disliking the treatment of local whites but acknowledging it is tolerable so long as white ethnostates exist. They have stated we should place them directly in charge of white communities with some more autonomy, in return offering greater alliances and favorable local policies."
bbr.1205.a:0 "Agreed"
bbr.1205.b:0 "Disagree"

bbr.1206.t:0 "Status of the Mixed-Raced"
bbr.1206.d:0 "We can not ignore racial realities established by genetics and biology, and as such we must decide what to do with those who are of mixed-race heritage living in our nation as Garvey has made their inferiority and impure bloodline a known problem with our brand of Black Nationalism. We could make it legal to only join higher UNIA offices if one is a pure-blooded Black while only working with racially approved citizens or go further, and further segregation to make them considered a new racial category to be separated from pure Blacks."
bbr.1206.a:0 "Bar them from Politics"
bbr.1206.b:0 "Create new categories"

bbr.1207.t:0 "Liberty Halls Expand"
bbr.1207.d:0 "Liberty Halls are the common official meeting places for our organization. As such with the rise of UNIA it has seen expansion and now we are receiving requests to endorse them as a new form of townhalls, making UNIA's civic and political meeting place one and the same while receiving further state funding."
bbr.1207.a:0 "A fine idea"
bbr.1207.b:0 "It's not needed"

bbr.1208.t:0 "Back to Africa"
bbr.1208.d:0 "With Liberia back in our hands it is time to start achieving Garvey's dreams to send more Black citizens there. Of course, with our new sovereignty in the West it is less needed than it once was and this makes a useful hub of operations, causing calls for us to only send a handful for now."
bbr.1208.a:0 "Small Colonies"
bbr.1208.b:0 "Large Colonies"

### NOI Takes Power ###

bbr.1210.t:0 "Arresting Gladys Bentley"
bbr.1210.d:0 "Gladys Bentley is a cross-dressing performer known for her chorus of drag queens and her own singing career. She has since attempted to perform in our state despite its obvious immorality! We have since attempted to arrest her as we have other peddlers of immoral music but she seems to have fled the state as quickly as she entered. Perhaps we should try harder."
bbr.1210.a:0 "Place a Bounty"
bbr.1210.b:0 "We'll wait on it"

bbr.1211.t:0 "NOI Claims Vilified!"
bbr.1211.d:0 "Despite the NOI's rightful claims on the Holy Land of Jerusalem under the Prophet, Elijah Muhammad, heretical Middle East leaders have mocked him as a 'false prophet' with 'foolish ideas', and went on to suggest he would never succeed in his mission. They went on to mock our beliefs as not truly Muslim. Of course, this has only fired up the NOI base as being even more willing to strike."
bbr.1211.a:0 "Infidels"

bbr.1212.t:0 "Jews Flee!"
bbr.1212.d:0 "With our recent policy of fining and seizing Jewish wealth and businesses that NOI doctrine states is built on Black slavery, Jewish citizens are attempting to flee the state! Some think it would be best to let them go while hardliners don't like the idea and think they would go on to support our enemies, claiming they are already part of a conspiracy against us, and think they should be segregated into ghettos."
bbr.1212.a:0 "Stop them"
bbr.1212.b:0 "Let them go"

bbr.1213.t:0 "The Black Israelites"
bbr.1213.d:0 "An unorthodox religious group known as the Black Hebrew Israelites have become increasingly active in our lands and are best known for their belief that Black Americans are the true descendents of the Tribe of Israel. We have had contact with a handful of these groups, some of whom are Black Nationalist and Supremacist, however other Black Israelites are not. As such the nationalists such as the Church of the Living God, the Pillar Ground of Truth for All Nations have asked us to run out the non-nationalist factions. Of course, some within our government think the whole theology needs to be crushed and poses an internal threat to our power."
bbr.1213.a:0 "Hit non-nationalists"
bbr.1213.b:0 "Hit all Black Israelites"
bbr.1213.c:0 "Ignore the debate"

bbr.1214.t:0 "National Savings Pays Off"
bbr.1214.d:0 "The National Savings Plan has finally hit the three-year mark and as such we are reaping the savings that were sent to us. While we could lower the amount that is sent to us, many NOI members like the austere lifestyle it encourages and think we should maintain a similar policy."
bbr.1214.a:0 "We can relax now"
bbr.1214.b:0 "Support a similar policy"

bbr.1215.t:0 "Liquor Smuggled"
bbr.1215.d:0 "With the NOI's banning of liquor, an underground movement devoted to smuggling liquor has been created. Worse yet, these dens promote other immoral banned behavior such as repulsive music, blasphemy and other drugs. The Fruit of Islam requests additional funding to find these criminals."
bbr.1215.a:0 "Find them at all costs"
bbr.1215.b:0 "We only have so many resources to spare"

### Liberalism Prevails ###

bbr.13.t:0 "Nationalists Fail!"
bbr.13.d:0 "The Nationalist March on our congress failed today despite their numbers, with our army managing to route them and arrest the March leaders. Elijah Muhammad has fled the nation while most of the UNIA leadership has already been arrested. While some are upset the resources it cost us to end this would-be coup will destroy our nation the socialists claim it was necessary and are celebrating their victory over reactionaries."
bbr.13.a:0 "Very well"

bbr.14.t:0 "Future of the Nation"
bbr.14.d:0 "With the Nationalists having been felled and a lack of an internal common enemy there is now widespread disagreement between socialists and liberals on the future of the nation. The Syndicalist, Communist and other revolutionary left factions explicitly want us to include the 'People's Amendments' within our constitution which will restructure Congress partially after the Commune of France and have trade union representatives elected directly by workers become the largest force of our Congress and guarantees of 'rights to the full value of their labor'. Furthermore, it will limit the ability of pro-Capitalist parties to challenge the syndicalist system though they disagree on how far to go in this regard. However, the first draft will at least strongly limit capitalist wealth and the ability to found large businesses, disallow 'capitalist and reactionary' influence of the political system and illegalize 'collaboration with extreme, anti-Democratic and/or foreign pro-capitalist and pro-imperialist forces'. \n\nThe liberals and progressives have accused the revolutionary left of attempting to have a monopoly on political power and of de facto excluding non-Revolutionary left forces, calling it a de facto dictatorship, an accusation the syndicalists resent. They have put forward the Constitution of the Black Republic, which contains universal suffrage within a traditional political model with regional voting, separation of powers and the limitation of government power including in allowing some level of private property, which they say is necessary not only for liberty but for economic growth, investment and prosperity. With Du Bois having executive power and a major political wind since felling the right-nationalists, he will have to decide on one."

However as there are many internal disagreements on the nature of the socialist system and how far it should go many are calling for a snap election, especially Paul Robeson who essentially leads the orthodox syndicalist faction and is a strong defender of an economically egalitarian worker-run democracy while also supporting revolution against current capitalist forces and believes that the Red Militias are needed to protect workers rights. Running from what commentors call his right is James Ford's Centralist Socialists and Du Bois' wing of the Socialist Party. Both believe in a more gradual transition to socialist and maintaining some elements of the market where it may be of help, however Du Bois defends decentralization and mutual aid whereas Ford is a longtime ally 'Browderist' and believes in a centralized form of socialism with a pan socialist-vanguard and political pragmatism to protect it. This has led to accusations of Ford being little more than an opportunist by others but his seeming pragmatism and clear policies has led to much popularity."

Calling for a total revolution Haywood chastises Robeson for stopping short of what he considers a full-revolution against the forces of reaction, stating that building the new worker's economy to accelerate towards Communism and destroying the imperialists and their structures, internally and externally, should come before all else. \n\nThe other is the 'Jacobin' Ben Davis who models his beliefs off of the French Faction of the same name and their inspiriations from the Russian Bolsheviks and ealier European Communist Parties. Believing in transitioning from a syndicalist structure to a Party-based one he is a strong believer in a strong leadership that will 'aid the worker in building a ready state to defend the revolution' while defending against anti-Communist forces, and in shifting the goals of the revolution from syndicalism to a 'Black-American Bolshevism' which can then be used to aid the Internationale.

However, no musical artist has been as promoted, as beloved, or as widespread in homes and offices across our state as the glorious Le Sony’r Ra. \n\nBorn as Herman Poole Blount on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, ‘Sun Ra’ - as he likes to be called - has become a pioneer of the New Afrikan musical scene.

First getting his start in professional music after joining his High School Biology teacher’s band, Sun Ra would take off as a musical genius, eventually traveling to Chicago and then to New York, proving that Sun Ra had become a young but steady fixture of the national jazz scene before the violent birth of the Second American Civil War, and before he found himself elevated to be the symbolized sound of a whole newly birthed people. Now, he and his Arkestra use a combination of electronic instruments and outlandish vocalizations in a pure expression of conceptual, improvisational, modal jazz and our people’s shared soul. Along with music, he also dabbles in poetry, philosophy, theology, and political thought, standing as a true renaissance man of our new state. A noted Afro-futurist and Black nationalist driven on by visions of visiting Saturn, Sun Ra has tacit ties to both the ABB, UNIA, the Black Unity League, and the Nation of Islam, but steadfastly stays out of national politics as to not alienate his fellow man or his fans. With his Egyptian-influenced garb and his music from another world, this spaceman out of time is expected to bring new funk to our shores for decades to come as a nationally recognized and rewarded musical treasure."

The moderate but devoted and pious Michael King Sr. has begun to rise up the party hierarchy utilizing his immense and growing popularity. Perhaps the most popular clergyman in all of Georgia, this Daddy King of Atlanta might just be the new face the Peace Party needs, for all is not well in our administration. \n\nThe current leader of our party and nation is Father Divine - a devout Chrisitian that also happens to believe himself to be the physical manifestation of God. This belief was once just a small aspect of Father Divine’s personality, but it has now come to dominate his persona and his policy. Though he still wants what is truly best for our people and the nation, his zealotry is bordering on insanity. With party co-founder James Jones only feeding these delusions of grandeur, Father Divine’s god-complex has only inflated exponentially, and many feel he is partially to blame. In response, these disillusioned members of the Peace Party and our republic’s wider congress have begun to propose Michael King Sr. as a unity candidate for the party. What will happen remains unknown, but Michael King’s popularity only continues to rise as our party continues to destabilize."

The most obvious candidate to uplift would be James Jones - co-founder of the party with Father Divine, a devout Christian, and a titan of the Civil Rights movement. However, Jones’ legacy has been tainted by his acquiescence of Father Divine’s delusions, with Jones even backing him up and feeding Father Divine’s god-complex, only making the delusions worse. Luckily for us though, there is another. \n\nThe rising star of the Peace Party, Michael King Sr., has been nominated by a large and quickly growing group of moderates within the Peace Party that have begun to garner support from ministers across the aisle. These detractors of Father Divine claim the nation needs a new leader with a steady hand and a sane mind in order to guide us to the Promised Land, and state that this Michael King is the fresh, non-radical face the party and the nation needs to thrive. However, if we do not force Father Divine to retire, perhaps King can still help him stabilize the nation and the party from within his cabinet. Regardless, if we are to keep our mandate alive and strong, the Peace Party must solve this internal dilemma immediately."

While the policies on Christian ‘Pan-Americanist’ patriotism, piety, anti-racialism, and other wins for civil rights were to be kept in place, Father Divine’s more extreme laws are now to be rolled back and made less harsh. The strict chastity laws have been loosened, allowing small amounts of smoking, drinking, and profanity while also dropping the ban on giving gifts, the limits on how many people can be in one mixed-sex grouping, and the strict national dress code, among so many other ludicrous laws. Welfare and insurance have been reintroduced, though administered by Christian institutions, and capitalism has been made more socially responsible. Though Father Divine is still uplifted by the state as a hero, he is no longer an infallible one, and the developing cult of personality around his god-complex has been snuffed out. Good, moral, non-dogmatic, and non-sacrilegious piety has been brought back to our republic, and under President Micheal King Sr., the future for our people has never seemed brighter."

One such icon was the Ebenezer Baptist Church - one of the most famous Black Churches in Georgia and the very house of worship of our own Daddy King. Micheal King Sr. got his start at that parish, rising through the hierarchy of the Church there and eventually becoming the Church leader, but it was tragically burnt down by a mob of Old Democrats and Klansmen led by a man named George Ellis Ray shortly before the conflict ended. With our reacquisition and reconciliation of Atlanta, President King has moved to have the Ebenezer Baptist Church rebuilt atop the ashes of the old one, where it will stand as a memorial to those lost in the conflict, and as the new center of both his sermons and the Peace Party."

One such new rising pastor is none other than the son of our own Michael King Sr. Michael Luther King Jr. - named after his father and given the Conformation name Luther due to he and his father’s shared admiration for the famous Protestant protestor - has risen to be one of the most popular young religious figures in Atlanta. Born in 1929, Michael Jr. has been by his father’s side for years, following his rise to power and learning in his shadow. A studied theologian, a fierce advocate for civil rights and social justice, and a moderate Christian Socialist, Michael Jr. is a man of conviction, dedication, piety, and with a deep love of all humanity. Despite a period of losing faith during his adolescence, his crisis of faith has been resolved now that he is free from under his father’s shadow, and he is known for his fiery rhetoric, his immense and powerful speaking voice, and his ability to rouse a crowd and be a leader to his fellow man - abilities that have come to adorn him with much respect and popularity from his community. Though he is still young, currently studying at Morehouse College, he has become one of the rising stars in the eyes of the Church and the state - a fact likely aided by his relationship to the President. He dreams that one day the racial issues that divide us will finally come to pass, so that we all may walk into our new future together."

Largely led by Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew of the Commandment Keepers Ethiopian Hebrew Congregation of the Living God Pillar & Ground of Truth, with aid from Frank S. Cherry and Howard Zebulun Plummer, these Black Hebrews once were spread throughout the American countryside from New York City to Tennessee to Virginia, but with the creation of our Black state, most migrated to our borders in droves. Since then, their movements have only grown and coalesced in this safe-haven our people have labored to create, and now they stand as a significant obstacle to our goals. These heretics may share our skin, but they follow a faith that is utterly reprehensible to everything the Nation of Islam stands for.

Even now, Black Hebrews across the nation have begun to take up arms, forming militias to protect themselves from our police forces and military reprisals. Parts of the nation in Georgia and Alabama have become militarized zones, with small fire-fights between Muslim and Jewish paramilitaries breaking out occassionaly as barricades and makeshift fortresses are built in city streets. Conflict is in the air as these centuries-old faiths do battle on new soil with fresh blood, and many fear that it is too late to stop the rise of these false sons of David. Though they claim to be the true Lost Tribe, we should remind them of reality before they consume our Nation of Islam and everything the Prophet stands for."

With [root.getleader] leading the defence and with Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew leading the attack, it would seem that the Holy Wars have finally crossed the sea and now the New World shall be the sight for this next confrontation between Abrahamic faiths. With Frank S. Cherry’s death squads cutting a swathe of destruction through the city as a river of innocent blood flows behind him, and with Rabbi Matthew and Howard Zebulun Plummer pushing with the main force to the heart of the capital’s administrative district, we must act fast to stop these Black Hebrews from toppling the Nation of Islam. With our backs to the walls and with ammunition and manpower running low for both sides, it is only a matter of time before this horrid play finally plays out, and the nation that is left standing in the aftermath may be irrevocably different from the state we defend today.

In accordance with Sharia Law and in recognition of the hudud crimes committed by Matthew and his allies, Elijah Muhammad has called for these heretical zealots to be tried before God and executed by the state. After a brief show trial adjudicated by Muhammad, the Prophet declared that the lower leaders of the Black Hebrew movement like Frank S. Cherry and Howard Zebulun Plummer were to be put to death by public beheading, but Rabbi Wentworth Arthur Matthew himself would instead be subjected to death by lethal stoning. \n\nRabbi Matthew and his compatriots were soon carried through the streets of Atlanta, stripped naked as the massive crowd of on-lookers hurled rotten food and garbage at their bodies while shouting curses and obscenities at the traitors. The atmosphere of violence was so intense that a few of the lower members of the Commandment Keepers being executed this day were killed before they could even reach the gallows, with one such low-ranking Rabbi being shot by a young NOI fanatic by the name of Malik el-Shabazz, who has since been lauded as a state hero. As the criminals were finally marched up onto the public platform at the middle of Westside Park, the process of executing these heretics was soon underway. After a brief introduction of prayers and speeches by Elijah Muhammad and his confidants, the executioner got to work. Within moments, the heads of Frank Cherry and Howard Plummer, along with a few other lower Rabbis, were rolling across the floor of the gallows and onto the grassy ground below, spilling blood and spinal fluid as they twitched and fell to the earth. With these accomplices and zealots dealt with, the final head of the Hebrew Hydra was all that was left to dispose of. After a barrage of stones and rocks beat his naked body, ripping open more flesh with each meaty, dense thud, Wentworth Arthur Matthew collapsed in a pool of his own blood while the crowd around him cheered, chanting the Prophet’s and Allah’s names as they moved to mob the stage so that they could tear this traitor’s corpse apart. As the cacophony of violence and retribution finally ended, Elijah’s state stood more secure than ever before, atop a mountain of heretical blood and an unshakeable faith in Allah."

### Madagascar ###
MAG_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Madagascar was gained by Germany after the Weltkrieg; It was never meant to be a valuable position, forever meant to hold little strategic purpose. Enter Reinhard Heydrich, an upstart admiral in the Mittelafrikan Navy who was appointed to oversee the island. He has plans to transform the island into a mighty base for the German Navy, and  to do this he needed men. So he capitalized on a small wave of Jewish Immigrants to turn Madagascar into a haven for Jews fleeing oppression across the globe, going as far as to give out bonuses for men with “Jewish Heritage” to move to the island. Heydrich’s projects are coming at a cost and many of these Settlers wish to take matters into their own hands..."

### Zambia ###
ZAM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "When Britannia fell to the tide of the reds, the Empire’s vast territories in Africa were “Temporarily occupied” by the Germans to prevent them from falling into chaos. That was almost 10 years ago and since Kenya-Uganda, Nigeria and North Rhodesia were occupied but given a high degree of autonomy. That was the plan, since the territory of North Rhodesia has been occupied by a German Garrison which has disbanded the government and placed the region under the control of Hans Hüttig. The Huns boot stamped over the lands, and many wonder if the Empire could Strike Back in North Rhodesia. "

### Westafrika ###
CIV_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "“The Tripartite Colony” as it is known is the result of the colonies of the Cote D’Ivoire, Togoland and the Gold Coast being merged into one government under German supervision. Things are not fine though, corruption is present at every turn, Firestone has bought immunity from the law and the governor is aging. French, German, and British interests all compete and soon enough the interests of one of these groups will take the top priority. That is of course if Westafrika survives the coming storms.."

### Mittelafrika ###
MAF_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Once the Weltkrieg ended Germany gained extensive territorial gains in Africa. When Britain fell, the vast patchwork of colonies under German rule were united, at least in theory. In reality, Mittelafrika was nothing if not a vast mirage, governments across the dark continent operated on their own, outside of Dar-Es-Salaam’s reach. Heinrich Schnee has presided over “Mittelafrika” since, but his government is far from functional and radicals such as Göring and Heydrich undercut the DKG at every step. The survival of the fragile colonial patchwork lies in the balance, Mittelafrika’s fate is being decided before our eyes. "

### Nigeria ###
NGR_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Nigeria was once the crown jewel of British West Africa, but in the new contintental order, Nigeria has suffered. Under German control, tensions between the Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba ethnicities have exacerbated the fragile state of politics in the colony. Now, with Hugh Clifford too exhaused to continue his rule, the next election may well decide the fate of the battered colony. Three men stand poised to take control whenever this event occurs. Benjamin Nnamdi Azikiwe is Nigeria's foremost nationalist, and he has rallied most of Nigeria's other native nationalist elements behind him in the hopes of wresting the colony from European control. Nigeria stands on the precipice. Can she be saved?"

### Kenya-Uganda ###
KEN_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Kenya-Uganda has chafed under German rule for over a decade now, enduring hardship after hardship, only being able to relish its relative autonomy compared to other regions of Afrika. The Mau-Mau Revolt, a rebellion over a decade old, still rages, and most European economic investment has dried up. To change would be to embrace the fact that the current administration is a failure, but there is little choice. The most powerful family in Kenya, the Leakey family, has representatives in most major parties in Kenya, and it seems that one of the Leakey brothers will end up in charge of the country. It is a matter of when, not if, but whenever it does occur, they face a daunting task in preventing a total collapse. "

### Rhodesia ###
ZIM_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Collapse of the British Empire seemed to be the end of British Rule in Africa, as hunnic boots crossed the border into formerly British Colonies, yet in the darkest hour Rhodesia remains free from Mittelafrika’s gaze for another day. Despite the Huns fighting for this land in both 1921 and 1925, holding out while our brothers were lost. Along with South Africa, Rhodesia is one of the last strongholds of British Loyalism in Africa. However times are changing and the future is uncertain, Rhodesia may not live to see the day when British Rule is restored to the world, and many wonder how long until the Kaiser’s Men come marching over the border again. "

### Mau-Mau ###
KIK_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "It has been an 11 long years since the brave Mau-Mau rose up against the Anglo-Hunnic Colony of Kenya-Uganda. Although the brave men and women of the Mau-Mau still fight with the same strength as they did when they first rose up, the years have taken their toll. The old Weltkrieg era weapons are falling apart when used, that is if they even can be, as ammo is an increasingly scarce resource. Despite these set backs, the Mau-Mau fight on, as only they can free Kenya with the aid of their Glorious Leader Obama. It is Only Obama who can save Kenya, and it is only with Totalism that Obama can free Kenya! Long Live Obama! Long Live Totalism! "

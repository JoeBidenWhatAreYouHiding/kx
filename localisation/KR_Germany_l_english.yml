POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Born 27 January 1859, Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert ascended the throne upon the death of his father, Frederick III, in June of 1888. He quickly oriented the German Empire into new belligerence, starting with the dismissal of Otto von Bismarck. With a renewed interest in expansionism the German Colonial Empire grew larger, and the Ruhr steadily became the manufacturing hegemon of Europe. His relentless ambition, however, had easily led Germany into conflicts with its neighbors, including a naval arms race with the United Kingdom and foreign policy that ultimately isolated Germany from most of the great powers.\n\nThis situation, resulting in Germany having to carry the burden of "weaker" allies, was what it had to contend with during the Weltkrieg. Yet Wilhelm remained steadfast throughout the conflict, having asserted himself many times against both the military and civilian leadership and refusing to accept a peace that wouldn't bring Germany glory. Shockingly, he also practiced caution when his generals advocated reckless aggression. The pivotal moment came with the Kaiser's silent approval of the Hindenburg-Ludendorff Dictatorship, the result of which would not only irrevocably change German politics but also finally bring the Weltkrieg to a victorious end.\n\nYet the Ludendorff Dictatorship would slowly chafe upon Wilhelm II, likely due to his lack of personal control over the aging general. Once Ludendorff's intrigues had failed, his friendship with Hugenberg evaporating, and he lost the favor of the Kaiser, Wilhelm found it easy to force the dictator's resignation and bring in his personal ally Alfred von Tirpitz. Tirpitz's chancellorship was far more amenable, and the 'Golden Years' of Tirpitz's rule made the Kaiser generally confident that his fatherland could now run itself, so long as he maintained a guiding hand.\n\nHis domain over the Kaiserreich has now stretched to nearly 50 years, longer than even the old Kings of Prussia, and he watches with both pride and caution over his fiefdom. Having seen the revolutions which shook many European nations erase relatives and rivals alike, Wilhelm now sits as one of the last symbols of the old order on the Continent, surrounded by hungry rivals. The worsening situation has led the concerned Kaiser to wonder if it would be wise to step into politics once more and ensure his crown is not torn asunder..."
POLITICS_WILLY_3_DESC:0 "Born 6 May 1882, Friedich Wilhelm Victor August Ernst, eldest child of Kaiser Wilhelm II, has now ascended to the throne as Kaiser Wilhelm III. While Prince Wilhelm has been known for a lot of things, from his love of association football to his fondness for Tudor architecture, his most headline-making of traits would be his intensive support for his father's Weltpolitik. Wilhelm III had long held a predilection for German expansionism, immediately seeking a generalship upon the commencement of the Weltkrieg. While his initial failings in starting the Verdun Offensive had caused many generals to reassess the role of the nobility in the military, his close coordination with Kurt von Schleicher and better showing during the Kaiserschlacht had been what the Kronprinz needed to return to Berlin as a hero to his people. Basking in the glory of the Adler's capture of the mantle of world power imbued the future Kaiser with an insatiable hunger.\n\nIn the post-Weltkrieg world, Wilhelm III would utilize his relationship with Kurt von Schleicher to remain politically relevant, promoting his ideology of hierarchy during the November Uprisings and eagerly casting doubt upon the generals who once criticized him when time came for the Ludendorff Dictatorship to fall. While he has been able to gain popularity due to his messages against the likes of Hindenburg, his repeated visits to numerous paramilitary organizations had definitively harmed his reputation among many Germans. The most furious of onlookers had come to be Wilhelm III's own father, who, over time, had to persistently forbid his son from making obvious political sympathies public.\n\nYet as Wilhelm III now sits upon the throne of the Kaiserreich, commanding its prestigious armies and its ocean-going navy, none can know what the war hound may desire. From an enhancement of German power to simple maintenance of the present Weltreich, the possibilities now stand endless before the new head of the House Hohenzollern."

### Reichskanzlers & Others ###
POLITICS_NOSKE_DESC:0 "Many important men came from privileged backgrounds, something which later influenced their ideals. The same cannot be said of Gustav Noske, whose family and early life enshrined the social democracy he'd hold dear in the future. Born to a family of weavers and manual laborers on 9 July 1868 in Brandenburg an der Havel, Gustav would follow in his father's footsteps after his basic education and travelled across the nation as a journeyman. He achieved early notability by establishing weaver's union that later merged into the German Wood Workers' Union. Noske would join the SPD in 1884 and become a parliamentarian and an active journalist.\n\nAs a Reichstag member Noske would become the SPD's military and colonial expert, despite never serving or touring across the nascent Kolonialreich. Despite agreeing with the party line opposing colonialism in practice, preferring a homefront focus, he distanced himself total condemnation of imperialism. It, and an ardent championing of national defence, would mark a clear separation in Noske's Social Democracy from the countless theoreticians fruitlessly re-interpreting Marx.\n\nWith the ascension of Friedrich Ebert as chairman and the outbreak of the War, Gustav became Ebert's right-hand man and pushed support of the Empire's war as a "defensive measure". Despite the disdain he had for Ludendorff and Hindenburg in crushing the Reichstag's power, Noske would mitigate the Spartacist Uprising through Freikorps units, being nicknamed the "November Butcher" among the far-left.\n\nAs Ebert's health waned and Alfred von Tirpitz held power, the SPD would become dominated by Gustav and join the Grand Coalition. This choice anger the remaining "left" of the party, which would dislodge Noske from his position after the Admiral's death and the collapse of his alliance. The future Reichskanzler would not have to wait long to once again step into the limelight, and now with the Kaiser's confidence he will do everything to establish a genuine Social Democracy. For the working class shall achieve happiness and stability inside the existing Weltreich."

POLITICS_VOGEL_DESC:0 ""

POLITICS_WELS_DESC:0 "Patience and persistence has finally rewarded the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands left-wing. Born on 15 September 1873 to an inkeeper family, Otto Wels would be exposed to the SPD's politics early as his father's business was a hub for dissident rhetoric. Near the turn of the century Wels was already a representative in the Social Democrats' organization, and it wouldn't be much longer until he ended up as the party secretary of Brandenburg and contributed to the "Vorwärts" newspaper.\n\nWhile Wels was supportive of the Burgfriedenspolitik of the Weltkrieg, desiring a victorious Germany first before social reform, he had not allowed himself to be swept up in Ebert's more rightward turn or the growing antipathy of the SPD towards its more radical members. It was Wels who championed the USPD's right to exist when they had first broken away even if he remained in the Social Democrats himself. The November Uprisings were a trial for Otto's committment to speaking for the radicals, but he became a heroic figure as he talked down numerous revolting barracks and swiftly condemned the violence of Luxemburg and Liebknecht. As Ludendorff's rule became established and Ebert had slavishly followed the flow of politics, Otto was firmly disgusted with the SPD and became convinced it was he who had to correct the ship. Wels withstood censure from Noske's right-wing and slowly built a committed, loyal base beneath himself with international activist Hans Vogel.\n\nEventually it would be Otto Wels who would unseat Gustav Noske as party chairman once Tirpitz had died. Otto's tenure as chairman had made the SPD far more belligerent to the status quo than it was prior, with demands for true reform of the German system now being echoed at a higher volume. Now, as Reichskanzler, Wels has his chance to bring his social democracy to the Kaiserreich: tempered imperialism, an accord with the radicals, and a full redemption of the reformer Karl Marx."

POLITICS_LENSCH_DESC:0 "Like a spectre from oblivion that manifested itself to haunt the weak-willed Social Democrats and Revisionists, the new Reichskanzler is an enigma when it comes to his early life. What can be established is that Paul Lensch was born in Potsdam on 31 March 1873 and was an avid reader of Hegel and Marx. He would go on to study economics, political science, and write for the Leipziger Volkszeitung in 1902. In his capacity as the head of the paper and a parliamentarian Lensch represented the most anti-Revisionist and hardliner left-wing of the SPD, together with Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.\n\nThe road on which the once-comrades ventured to establish true Socialism in Germany would diverge with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Paul would form the Lensch-Cunow-Haenisch group in 1915 and champion the stance of the pro-war Majority SPD using Marxist theory. Together with his close associates, he would advocate that the World War was merely the first step towards the World Revolution, where the classes of Germany would unite into through the implementation of war socialism and sweep away the autocrats and capitalists of the hostile regimes.\n\nUnfortunately for Lensch, the Ebert-Noske SPD would be out maneuvered by the OHL Dictatorship, letting the Russians get away with an autocratic republic and the Frenchmen to pervert Socialism in an orgy of red-tinted bourgeois violence. Only the ascension of Admiral von Tirpitz and the SPD's participation in the Grand Coalition would soothe the L-C-H-Gruppe. Germany's strongest anti-Revisionist could not be idle, however, for the Revisionist Marxist wing took control of the party from Noske following the collapse of the Coalition and threatened to unify with the USPD.\n\nFollowing the shocking selection of Lensch for the job of the Reichskanzler the dream of leftist traitors, and a new opportunity would open before the Social Democrats and the German Proletariat itself. A true People's Community, unified as a modern machine rolling over the international bourgeoisie old and new, especially the Totalist rot, on its way to ensure International Socialism at last."

POLITICS_MEINECKE_DESC:0 "Had the German Empire lost, the new Reichskanzler might have exemplified the road which it followed, yet with the Kaiserreich victorious Friedrich Meinecke has fought against the mainstream current for years. Born 30 October 1862 to a family whose men were either postmen or parish workers for generations, Meinecke was shaped early on by this Prussian Lutheran sense of civil service. He would later study German and History at the University of Berlin, with the latter becoming his main scientific interest. Although chiefly a lecturer, Friedrich Meinecke became politically active, shedding his conservatism and becoming close towards the left-liberal positions of Friedrich Naumann.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began Meinecke still pushed external imperialism and internal colonization of the Polish partition, alongside the bordering regions in Congress Poland and Courland. Yet, as the War became global and the fronts stalled, he began to oppose unrestricted submarine warfare and a total victory peace. With the rising tide of the OHL’s DVLP, Friedrich founded a cross-party group of opposition, the People's Association for Freedom and Fatherland, which despite garnering support from across the aisles failed to materialize gains.\n\nAs the victorious Empire stagnated into Ludendorff’s personal playground, Meinecke returned to academic activities. When the Tirpitizan Coalition manifested, however, the professor was galvanized into action, for the Progressive People's Party was left rudderless after the death of Naumann and ineffective leadership of Otto Wiemer. Meinecke took over the FVP, and boldly opposed the coalition on principle, feeling that a reasoned future required more parliamentarization than the scraps offered by the Admiral.\n\nThe years of calling for a new liberal offensive finally paid off, and the now-Reichskanzler Meinecke has to reform the Empire while preserving both the German monarchy and nationalism. It will not be easy, since even certain elements of his party are unwilling to support a man over whom the spectres of his past and nasty anti-semitism hang heavy."

POLITICS_MANN_DESC:0 "The late Wilhelmian decades have transfigured many aspects of Germany, including its people. Perhaps this dramatic change cannot be shown better than in the life of the new Reichskanzler. Born on 6 June 1875 in Lübeck to a famous Hanseatic patrician line, the young Mann’s fortune would quickly shift. When his father died in 1891, the family’s possessions were sold to cover moving to Munich. His later writing for various papers quickly showed his conflicted nature, the first being “Das zwanzigste Jahrhundert”, a chauvinistic journal where he helped his brother Heinrich, who would surprisingly become the more pacifist of the pair. The second was Simplicissimus, a satirical journal full of critiques of Wilhelmian society and Prussian order. Despite what his later stance might suggest, the Agadir Crisis shocked Mann, fearful of a European conflict.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, Thomas Mann became a zealot for the Kaiserreich’s aims. He contributed to the discourse in two books, Thougts in War and Reflections of a Nonpolitical Man. Opposing further democratization, pacifism, and the Anglo-French “civilization”, Thomas’ perception of war as a spiritually liberating force would be shocking to many, and even contribute to the nascent Conservative Revolution. However, Mann also cast judgement on the autocratic Tsarist police state and understood the power of democracy’s march world-wide.\n\nAfter the war Thomas Mann quit politics, yet the mindless barbarism and Prussianism of the Ludendorffian years began to birth doubts in his mind. Verbal attacks on his friend, Walther Rathenau, and the assassination attempt on Zentrum’s Erzberger would drift Thomas closer to the FVP. Although sympathetic to the oppositionist stance during the Tirpitizan era, Mann would only join the party after the collapse of the DVLP.\n\nAs the new Reichskanzler is a man of complex history, many within his own camp do not know what the future holds for the Empire. A unified, slowly democratizing Europe to defend German “culture”, or perhaps a renewal of the radical stance present in his Weltkrieg books?"

POLITICS_RATHENAU_DESC:0 "Life is full of men who embody conflicting ideals and defy the observations of others, and Walther Rathenau would be one such man. Born to a prominent Jewish businessman Emil Rathenau on 29 September 1867, Walther Rathenau had been brought up with expectations to succeed his father in AEG, but at first rejected this fate. After receiving a doctorate in physics while studying in Strasbourg, Rathenau attempted to become a reserve officer in the Prussian Guard Cuirassiers, but was stopped by anti-Jewish biases. Now forced to follow his father, he joined the AEG board in 1899 and became a leading industrialist of the Kaiserreich, setting up power plants from Manchester to Baku and turning the AEG into an industrial titan.\n\nIn the same period, Walther Rathenau would become growingly political, befriending NLP politician Bernhard Dernburg. He condemned the treatment of the Herero in Südwestafrika alongside other colonial policies, and became further controversial through his radically pro-assimilation tone towards fellow German-Jewish countrymen.\n\nAt the onset of the Weltkrieg, Rathenau suggested the creation of an organization to acquire materials for the army. While he had only managed his proposed War Raw Materials Department for less than a year, it was pivotal in aiding the Heer's victory against the Entente. The war, however, exposed intolerable national weaknesses to Rathenau. In its aftermath, Rathenau would join the FVP and begin conceptualizing his solutions to Empire's ills. In the "Die neue Gesellschaft", "The New Society", he envisioned a state run by unimpeded mangers, with class conflicts removed alongside class itself yet bereft of the utopianism of socialism.\n\nNow Walther Rathenau stands as Reichskanzler, and there is little in his way to start molding his ambitious dreams into reality. Among his many seemingly divergent opinions Rathenau hopes to achieve a synthesis. With his beloved Empire tuned exactly to his wishes, it will stand for eternity, even if he has to drag the German people towards such a glorious future."

POLITICS_STRESEMANN_DESC:0 "For many politicians their early years are formative to the positions they will champion through their career. This could not be more true in case of Gustav Stresemann. Born in 1878 to a Berlin beer merchant and an innkeeper, the young Stresemann inherited his parents' acumen for trade and developed an adoration for German Romanticism. During his time as a student his political activism started, writing for the Allgemeine Deutsches Universität-Zeitung and rallying against policies like naval armament and the alignment of student groups towards the SPD.\n\nIn 1901 Gustav would begin his political journey in earnest, joining the local Dresden chapter of Friedrich Naumman's National-Social Association. Stresemann easily took to the group's ethos of Mitteleuropan advocacy, oppositions to socialism and syncretization of liberal values. Stresemann would then join the NLP proper in 1907, having prior organized associations against conservatives in agriculture and heavy industry.\n\nBefore the Weltkrieg started, Stresemann was exiled by the NLP inner circle after his support of select social programs. Afterwards, he promoted naval expansion as a guarantee of German global trade, something which together with Albert Ballin's work to form a friendship between the Empire and the United States could ensure the Reich's economic dominance. This bend to patriotism alongside annexationist views during the Weltkrieg kept Stresemann relevant.\n\nStresemann would ultimately become chairman in 1917 to maintain NLP independence against the hastily expanding DVLP. Despite his tacit support of Ludendorff, he became disillusioned with the elitist politics of the regime. When Tripitz's Grand Coalition came to be, Stresemann organized a group of National Liberals, remnants of the Free Conservatives, parts of Zentrum and the right-wing of the FVP into an official "internal opposition". With the Admiral's death a new road opened for Stresemann, a chance to bring his concept of Germany as an economic world power and the unifier of Europe to fruition."

POLITICS_MAX_WEBER_DESC:0 "The German Empire is full of intellectual revolutionaries or ambitious reformers, and the National Liberals have found their own man: Max Weber. Born in Saxony on the 21st of April, 1864, to a parliamentarian of the NLP, Weber's home life was possessed by talks of academia and politics. Weber was deeply influenced by this atmosphere, becoming immersed in intellectual pursuits and even going so far as to read all forty volumes of Goethe during his time as a student.\n\nWeber would satiate his appetite for politics by dabbling in associations such as the Verein für Socialpolitik, Evangelical Social Congress, and even the Pan-German League through the 1890s while remaining part of the faculty at the Royal Friedrich Wilhelm University of Berlin. Weber's early writing would come to influence Naumann's creation of the National-Social Association, and he steadily became a recognized academic figure. This reputation would only flourish further with his eventual founding of the German Sociological Association and his publishing of "The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism", the first of his works to outline his pessimistic vision of a society ruled by rational-legal systems.\n\nWeber finished his magnum opus "Economy and Society" in 1929, the glory of the Tirpitz Years shining through his prose, affirming his imperialist opinions, alongside his growing cynicism of the enlarging imperial bureaucracy. Afterwards, he steadily rose from an intellectual heavy-weight in the NLP to one of its leading figures. Weber's individualist oriented sociology found strong support in the post-Weltkrieg German Empire, especially as a counter to the collectivism associated with Émile Durkheim. Despite his critiques of the modern capitalist system, Weber remained convinced of the innovational value associated therein, and has thus remained positioned against socialism, syndicalism and conservatism.\n\nNow as Reichskanzler, Weber seems poised to bring many of his ideas, namely his dream to free the German people from a future trapped within the "iron cage" of modernity, to reality."

POLITICS_PAPEN_DESC:0 "There were many nobles who served the Empire since its foundation, especially in the position of Reichskanzler. Yet none were so fully ingrained in the spirit of "politicking" as Germany’s newest helmsman. Franz von Papen, born 29 October 1879 in Werl, holds an impressive pedigree, coming from an old Westphalian family which earned their noble status and wealth through salt production. He requested that his parents send him to a cadets school, after which he continued a Prussian military education. During his time in the army he fraternized with future power players, chief among them Kurt von Schleicher.\n\nThe most important task given to Papen, before his times in politics, was the function of a military attaché to the embassy in Washington, a position he earned thanks to a good relationship with his fellow student Kaiser Wilhelm II. Franz even met, and helped to escape from Veracruz, figures like Douglas Macarthur and the later Franklin D. Roosevelt. His fortune in America would, however, turn for the worse after his expulsion in 1916 on charges of sabotage. After returning to Europe, he served on the Western and Ottoman fronts of the Weltkrieg with distinction.\n\nIn the wake of the Ludendorff-Hindenburg regime, Franz von Papen returned to his estate and to be a "gentleman farmer", although he still dabbled in local politics as part of the monarchist wing of the Centre Party. His fortune would drastically change when the Tirpitz government formed, for the new Kanzler required someone more reliable to lead Zentrum in place of Matthias Erzberger.\n\nVon Papen utilized his high society connections to take control of the party, and soon the entire nation as the newly elected Reichskanzler. Under the leadership of Franz the German Centre Party shall be remodeled to better serve the true values of Germany. Aristocratic dominance combined with select social charity, increased centralism, and total destruction of leftist enemies of the Fatherland. Only time will tell if a man whose Catholicism kept him in the party will turn it into a second DkP, or if the aristocrats of old will dance to Papen's tune."

POLITICS_KAAS_DESC:0 "A Catholic priest becoming a Reichskanzler of the world's strongest Protestant empire is certainly unusual, but these are strange times in which particular men trying to restore normalcy find their chance. That much is true of Ludwig Kaas, a devoted clergyman and, only recently, a rising star in the Centre Party. Born 23 May 1881 in the historical archbishop-elector seat of Trier, young Kaas excelled in school and graduated as best in his class. What followed was further study of theology and finally an ordination to the priesthood in 1906 in Romem where he also earned his doctorate in canon law.\n\nHis career was initially typical of a German Roman Catholic priest, teaching law in universities and fighting to gain more rights for the faithful in the Lutheran dominated Prussia. At that time Kaas also forged a friendship with then Apostolic Nuncio to Germany and future Cardinal Secretary of State Eugenio Pacelli. It is likely that the future Kanzler would not have ever entered politics if not for the dramatic changes inside the Zentrum.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Dictatorship and the creation of the Grand Coalition, the Erzberger-led party relinquished their supposed "anti-patriotic" stances by placing Franz von Papen in charge. While the relatively "leftist" and non-denominational inclination of Erzberger were somewhat concerning to Kaas and his close associate Konrad Adenauer, Papen's radical anti-federalist bend forced them into action. Adenauer, a fellow Rhenish patriot, convinced Ludwig Kaas to stand for the leadership of the Centre in hopes of safeguarding the Rhineland and pious conservatives of the whole Empire.\n\nNow, Reichskanzler Kaas is not only in command of his party but also the entire Kaiserreich. While not a true politician, leaving most of the ideological matters to Adenauer and the rest of the cabinet, Ludwig Kaas has outlined a clear goal for his promised one term. Rejection of dangerous modernism, new authority to states and provinces, and the ultimate goal for any German Roman Catholic: the signing of a Concordat between the Empire and the Holy See."

POLITICS_ERZBERGER_DESC:0 "Many future leaders had to struggle with an antagonistic environment, but in Germany no man has had to suffer as much for their beliefs than Matthias Erzberger. Born 20 September 1875 in Buttenhausen, the future Zentrum leader's education instilled in him a deep desire to reform the Empire and help the people. Starting as a teacher, he became involved with Catholic workers’ associations and helped found multiple Christian trade unions to counter Marxism. Elected to the Reichstag in 1903, Erzberger quickly became a colonial expert. Vitriol was soon lobbed at him from the conservative side, all due to speaking out against the forced labor of Africans and rampant colonial corruption. Later, he allied Kanzler Bernhard von Bülow, an action which would, eventually, spell disaster.\n\nDespite his relatively progressive views, Erzberger was swept up by the Spirit of 1914 and wrote pro-annexationist articles at the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, becoming the right-hand man of Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg. However, with the war stalling to a crawl Erzberger began to call for peace negotiations, while also supporting Hollweg in a crusade against unrestricted submarine warfare. Although the intention was to see Bülow’s government return, the chaos led to Hollweg’s dismissal and the institution of the Ludendorff-Hindenburg regime.\n\nMatthias Erzberger was branded an arch-traitor by the rising DVLP, marginalizing the Centre Party. An attempt on his life was made by far-right freikorps members, and despite surviving Erzberger would suffer from the shooting for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, the stain of being an “unpatriotic pacifist” forced Erzberger to give up power to Franz von Papen.\n\nAs the new Reichskanzler, despite the whole of Germany seemingly trying to stop it, Matthias Erzberger will try to accomplish all he can with the time he has left. Perhaps the stagnant years of conservative aristocratic rule and the danger of syndicalist revolutions has enlightened the people to what they need: A socially just, ecumenical, and reformed democratic Empire free of hatred."

POLITICS_SCHLANGE_SCHONINGEN_DESC:0 "If one were to look at the circumstances of his birth and early career, not much could have pointed towards a humble Lutheran son of a large rural estate owner becoming the Reichskanzler. Yet, this is exactly what happened to Hans Schlange, a student of agrarian sciences who took his second surname in honor of Schöningen, Pommern where he was born on 17 August 1886. Not much would have hinted at a political bend to the young man too, since beyond heeding the Weltkrieg’s call for patriotic duty, wounded for his Fatherland in the process, he had no inclination towards anything other than vague monarchism.\n\nHaving returned from the war to manage his family’s estate, Hans would be swept up in the success of the DVLP and join the Pomeranian chapter of the party as an ardent advocate for the Hindenburg-Ludendorff Dictatorship in the interests of stability. If not for the downfall of the nationalist general, Schlange- Schöningen would perhaps still contribute to the Völkisch atmosphere in his homeland, but the Tirpitz reorganization forced the man to change his perspectives.\n\nHans moderated, becoming increasingly closer to the Deutschkonservative faction within the Grand Coalition, working closely together with Kuno von Westarp to control the redirection of politics. The culmination of this “dediabolization” would be the eventual split and exit of Schlange and his agrarian allies from the now Hugenbergist DVLP.\n\nThe political vehicle he created during his break with the pro-Junker Alfred Hugenberg, the Christlich-Nationale Bauern- und Landvolkpartei (Christian-National Peasants' and Farmers' Party), would enter the DkP as a group filling the niche left by the comparatively rightist and pro-large farmer policies of von Westarp. Only time will tell If this alliance of “moderates” and small to medium farmers is enough to preserve Germany and its peasantry."

POLITICS_WESTARP_DESC:0 "Either by coincidence or by providence, Reichskanzler Westarp's career seems to mirror the German Empire itself. Born 12 August 1864 in the humble town of Ludom, Posen, Kuno Friedrich Viktor Graf von Westarp had both much and little to his name before his ascent. An Ascanian heritage, a promising time as a student, and an early interest in politics. This, alongside a fiery Völkisch stance in the Bund der Landwirte, easily placed him into the German Conservative Party, which he came to hold much sway in in 1913 as a stalwart rightist.\n\nThe German Fatherland Party's formation upon Hollweg's resignation proved advantageous, Westarp's support for unrestricted submarine warfare pleasing the quadrumvirate of Ludendorff, Hindenburg, Kapp, and Tirpitz. As editor of Kreuzzeitung, Westarp became a central speaker as he aided in the rightward shift of politics, basking in the glow of victory as the DVLP won in 1922. However, after Ludendorff's fall from grace, Westarp came to the camp of Tirpitz and became the main force of a "moderate" right in the Grand Coalition of 1927.\n\nContent to not hold the reins while the Admiral-Chancellor was alive, Alfred's death in 1930 forced him into action to keep chaos from possessing the Reichstag. While Ulrich von Hassell, Tirpitz's son-in-law and a political independent, would be put in power by the Kaiser, Westarp grew a base of his own as the new leader of the DVLP, Alfred Hugenberg, ostracized many. The DkP flourished as many sought stability and erasure of the Dictatorship's sins, granting Westarp's party a sweeping victory in 1932. To reduce the SPD's gains, Westarp formed a deal with Papen of Zentrum to maintain right-wing control.\n\nAs the "Unshakeable Prussian" remains Reichskanzler, the status quo stands strongly, with the violence of the November Uprisings or the repression of the Ludendorff Dictatorship fading to bitter memory. However, time is marching on, and many wonder if von Westarp, arch-conservative and aristocrat that he is, has the energy to march along with it..."

POLITICS_LETTOW_VORBECK_DESC:0 "Born 20 March, 1870, the "Lion of Africa", Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, son of a minor noble family in Pomerania, had followed the path of many of his sort. From the cadet corps in Potsdam to, ultimately, an officer commission in the Deutsches Heer, Lettow-Vorbeck's time in the military had firmly shaped his world view. The discipline demanded of Prussian men was a trait he had done his utmost to carry even through his participation in putting down the Boxer Rebellion and his efforts against the Herero in Südwestafrika, yet the conduct of anti-guerrilla campaigns often forced him to less than glamorous warfare.\n\nAll these early campaigns with the Schutztruppe would prove to give Lettow-Vorbeck the knowledge he needed to evade and harass the British throughout the whole of the Weltkrieg, earning him nothing short of a near-mythical heroic status across Germany. Alongside the likes of Manfred von Richthofen and, at the time, Erich Ludendorff, Lettow-Vorbeck earned the status of one of Germany's finest martial figures. In this capacity he easily became involved with rightist elements, yet also gestured against the Ludendorff Dictatorship as it shifted further into the far-right.\n\nThis bend towards the right-wing hasn't affected Lettow-Vorbeck as much as it did other military figures, as the Lion's popularity remains consistently high among the populace. To many, he represents Germany's illustrious empire in the flesh, a man who conquered the Dark Continent and firmly thrashed the Entente in the arena of battle. His friendship with members of Der Stahlhelm notwithstanding, Lettow-Vorbeck is lauded with respect across the aisle, and with the Chancellorship now his to command the Kaiserreich seems certain to continue its battle for its place in the sun under a reassessed vision of colonial ventures."

POLITICS_HUGENBERG_DESC:0 "Devotion, a force which drives men to ceaseless pursuits of furthering their nation, their people, or their race. There is no man in Germany who’d exemplify that zeal more than Alfred Hugenberg. Born 19 June 1865 to an affluent middle-class family in Hannover, the young Hugenberg declared his views firmly in his economic dissertation. Even then he called for colonizing Northwest German boglands with peasants to oppose the urban class, while also championing the expropriation of the East Elbe Junkers. While these stances softened over time due to politics, his demands of colonial living space, be it internal or external, have never lessened.\n\nLater Hugenberg would, alongside becoming a chairman of Krupp AG’s supervisory board, continue his agitation. This included harsh attacks against trade unions, aiding Germanization in Posen against the local Poles, and creation of the Pan-German League. His slavish work ethic led to the Hugenberg-Konzern controlling around half of the newspapers in the Empire, letting him spread ideas like the Volksgemeinschaft, master race, “Volk ohne Raum” concept and total destruction of Judaism.\n\nThe Weltkrieg was a turning point of the future Chancellor's fortunes, for the triumphant Kaiserreich and the rising Ludendorff Dictatorship were perfectly aligned with the vision of Alfred Hugenberg. He would, together with fellow Pan-Germanist Heinrich Claß, help found the German Fatherland Party, which he’d come to control in later years. Despite cautious support of the Tirpitzian Grand Coalition, Hugenberg would denounce the “softness” which crept into the alliance and manifested itself in the Westarpian mutiny following the Admiral’s death.\n\nFinally, God has made Alfred Hugenberg Reichskanzler. The DVLP will not lay down as the People’s Community must be built. Let the Empire know that Kanzler Hugenberg’s relentless ethic will ensure the sons of Germania are masters over all. No matter how many “Conservative” traitors, Jews, Marxists, Liberals, aristocrats, and hostile industrialists will stand in his way."

POLITICS_SCHLEICHER_DESC:0 "Some men have their destiny handed to them by their blood, but others must seize it with their own hands. Born 7 April 1882 in Brandenburg an der Havel, Kurt von Schleicher, son of a Prussian officer nobleman, took after his father and joined the military, becoming a Leutnant by 1900. He avoided political entanglements in the years before the Weltkrieg, preferring instead to focus upon his officer career, but he had established useful connections with the likes of Oskar von Hindenburg and Franz von Papen.\n\nDuring the Battle of Verdun, Schleicher became prominent by railing against war profiteering industrialists when the army was desperate, which had gained him the scorn of various Junkers and the respect of numerous SPD members. He would be recognized once more by opposing Ludendorff's interventionist cause against the nascent Commune of France, believing internal issues took priority, making him a rival against the short-sighted general. As the OHL Dictatorship matured, Schleicher built a loyal clique of soldiers around himself and utilized his cunning to pull support away from Ludendorff's throne.\n\nWhen Ludendorff's pursuit of power had grown out of control, it was Kurt von Schleicher and his friend, Kronprinz Wilhelm, who convinced the Kaiser to force the resignation of the dual dictators. Immediately, Schleicher snatched up the leaderless right-wing of the army, directing the generals towards a more "pragmatic" vision where the military guides the people rather than simply cajoles them. Always politically-savvy, Schleicher established numerous Heer connections, and also gained the support of the Deutsche Fraktion.\n\nThe newly appointed Reichskanzler Schleicher and his loyal "Kamarilla" are now ready to put their decades-long plans to action, swept into power amid chaos and disaster. For Schleicher, it is a chance to mold the Reich into the indomitable "Wehrstaat", but his tenure is also an opportunity for more men than just himself. The coming trials will lay bare if the "Red General" is truly what Germany required to attain its salvation, or if he is merely yet another Ludendorff..."

POLITICS_BRUCK_DESC:0 "A young dawn now shines upon the German nation, and the sentinels of stagnation must flee or burn before its rays. Born 23 April 1876 in Solingen, Westphalia, to bourgeois parents, Moeller van den Bruck had at first grown up a temperamental youth. An only child, Moeller was expelled from the gymnasium he attended for his academic apathy. He was more interested in philosophy, particularly Nietzsche, and studied in Berlin, Paris, and Italy. Writing his first cultural history of Germany while abroad, he would return home before the Weltkrieg where, in 1914, he would join the foreign affairs section of the OHL.\n\nIn 1916 as an army journalist, he penned his embrace of nationalism, "Der Preußische Stil", where he celebrated Prussia's will to power and critiqued "bourgeois" parliamentary liberalism. Later writing would further develop his views, with Moeller seeing the Western powers and Russia as "old countries" that were clinging to power against "young countries" like Germany and the United States. It was the task of the "young" Germany to fight against the rationalism and stagnation of the world and remain a beacon of optimism.\n\nAfter the war, Moeller joined political clubs and became a leading idealogue of the "Conservative Revolution". His 1923 magnum opus "Das Dritte Reich" would outline his vision of an empire for the German culture and not just German power. The work derided reactionary "preservationism", the racialist Völkischen, and Marxist materialists, and advocated an adaptive conservatism. Over time, he expanded his power base and propagated Jungkonservativen ideals across the Kaiserreich. Later, he would ally with the Kurt von Schleicher to come closer to the wheels of power, but he had always abhorred the general's "primitive" ways.\n\nHaving now outmaneuvered his former ally and taken the position of Reichskanzler, Moeller is free to command the nation to march towards his Third Reich. This new imperial ideal may never truly manifest, emulating the endless quest of Christian perfection, but for Moeller it is the effort of the journey itself that shall renew the German people and keep the "young nation" fresh forevermore."

His path since maturity was that of the ordinary Prussian noble officer, first entering the Kadettenanstalt Oranienstein and then the Royal Prussian Main Cadet Institute at Groß-Lichterfelde. He began as an infantry officer, and his early promise had made his superiors be more than happy to grant him promotions and send him to staff positions. Rundstedt spent most of the Weltkrieg in administrative positions, being more of a witness and reacting strategist to the war than an active participant, but he had spent his time in offices wisely. His peers could speak well of him, and he had come to learn the many nuances of high command and planning.\n\nAt the war's end, Gerd von Rundstedt had used his connections to evade Ludendorff's ire for his lack of participation in the Dictatorship. His apolitical nature, believing that a general's responsibility was war, granted him much prestige when Ludendorff fell, and he has now become a favorite among the General Staff. Having coalesced much of their opinions and thoughts for reform and then mixed in his own, Rundstedt now stands as one of the leading potential policy-makers in regards to military reform.§!"

Trained as an infantry officer in the Bavarian Army, he eventually rose to command the Bavarian I Army Corps, all while travelling extensively, taking up carpentry, and fulfilling his duties as a prince of the Bavarian royal family. In 1913, he became the heir apparent of the Kingdom, and a year later, he was assigned to lead the German Sixth Army during the Schlieffen Plan. Though his assignment was made due to his royal status, he proved to be an able and innovative commander. At the same time, however, he used his military command to push for Bavarian interests - refusing to withdraw his army from the Western Front to defend Prussia and thus forcing the General Staff to move troops from Belgium instead.\n\nIn July 1916, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and was assigned to command the Army Group Rupprecht, a rank he has held onto until today. In 1921, after the passing of his father, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Rupprecht was crowned as the new King of Bavaria, and since then reigns as a constitutional monarch with respect for the laws and institutions of his homeland.

In the years following the war, Mackensen broke expectations one after the other, bypassing the three-year preparation period for the General Staff and later serving as an adjutant to Wilhelm II himself, the first commoner to do so. On the Kaiser's 40th birthday, he was ennobled, becoming August von Mackensen, and was assigned to command XVII Army Corps - a prestigious position, as Crown Prince Wilhelm now served under him.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he was one of Germany's most successful and prestigious commanders, assigned to front after front in Europe - Galicia, Serbia, and finally Romania, shattering Entente resistance in all three campaigns. He returned to Germany a war hero and a Generalfeldmarschall, and continued to serve in the Army thenceforth.

As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, while additionally putting special attention upon the reformations of the Polish military, all while developing his own.

Schleicher tactically backed this faction, at least for a while, and after he became the Prussian Minister of War, he pushed his lifelong friend into the highest office of the OHL, consolidating his power over the Army and giving him a powerful base for his political ambitions.

It was during the war, most notably at the Battle of Arras during the ill-fated Nivelle Offensive, that Kesselring showed his aptitude with constructing clear battleplans. During the Weltkrieg he maintained an interest in the development of air power, noting how it had drastically altered the dimensions of warfare. A moment of experimentation came when, during the German intervention in the Russian Civil War, Kesselring had attempted to synchronize the attacks of planes with an infantry assault. Despite limited success, he began to grow more convinced in the promise of air power.\n\nHis Eastern Front experiences would solidify a distaste for Socialism, yet also his committment to aerial development. When the Weltkrieg had ended Kesselring, whose strengths in managing smaller units earned him recognition, was transferred to Mittelafrika. Contending with the inhospitable brush and enemies who regularly evaded conventional tactics, Kesselring began to draft his main reform plans that included a "modernization" of the Jaeger units of Germany.

By 1913 he had been appointed to the German General Staff's railway department per his own request, and it was in this capacity where he became the protégé of Wilhelm Groener. From this position, he had shown a remarkable acumen for organization and a mind for the political, his denunciation of "war profiteering" bringing scandal to his name during the Battle of Verdun. His one and only front-line position during the Weltkrieg would be during the Kerensky Offensive, where he coordinated defenses and counter-attacks in equal measure.\n\nHis Weltkrieg experiences had taught him the value of balancing caution with boldness, as well as the importance of logistical efficiency, and so, despite his perceived alliance to the forming OHL "Dictatorship", Schleicher snubbed Ludendorff early by not supporting interventionist maneuvers against the syndicalists in France.

Schleicher easily gained not only a higher position in the General Staff, yet also the personal approval and friendship of Crownprince Wilhelm for his patriotism and dedication to the monarchy.

He ended the two-year siege of Riga using encirclement and surprise, and would follow it up with the only German amphibious assault of the war that found success to seize Russian-held islands in the Baltic Sea. His success earned the respect of Ludendorff and the Kaiser, finding himself rewarded with the Pour le Mérite.\n\nWhile Hutier would be erroneously credited by French magazines during the Kaiserschlacht with the infiltration tactics that broke the back of the French Army, he at the time held little involvement in their development. The remark, however, and his witnessing of the success of the German stormtroopers, ingrained in Hutier a belief of their eternal value.

Be it stories of his father's service as a Prussian officer to the numerous garrison soldiers he saw, the militarism of Prussia was ingrained in him early, and so in 1903 he left home to join a cadet school. Despite lackluster results in his final exams, he entered the army as an officer cadet in 1907 and would serve as a communications officer at the onset of the Weltkrieg. In this capacity he was in charge of signals intelligence, and would fight most prominently at the Battle of Verdun, forming a reputation as a commander with wit yet also biting sarcasm. His later periods of military involvement were mostly within the Eastern Front, most notably his participation in garrison forces in the Don Kuban area. It was while witnessing the early maneuvers in the Caucasus, ultimately being part of the main push to Moscow during the Russian Civil War, that he had first become enamored with tank warfare. Both sides of the conflict were still thoroughly testing their armored units, with many soldiers on the ground having never seen a tank before, and so Guderian got to see firsthand a wide array of uses for panzers that the terrain was more than suited to. Most notable for the still-learning commander, the presence or supremacy of tank units seemed to be the deciding factor of victory or defeat in a few battles, a fact which Guderian would firmly take to heart.\n\nHis interest in armor was exacerbated by a formed friendship with Ernst Volckheim upon his return to Germany, with Volckheim introducing him to the possibilities of armored assaults and wider operations as the technology was being further developed. Guderian was quickly set ablaze with inspiration, taking Volckheim's own ideas even further and trying to build what connections he could to obtain panzer testing projects for himself. While he has grated on his ally Volckheim for being far more outspoken about panzers and speed, his enthusiasm and dedication to innovation has made him quite popular with other members of the Heer who want to expand on the Empire's nascent panzertruppen. As a result, Guderian stands as a star choice for reforming the Deutsches Heer into a posture of far more aggressive mobile warfare.§!"

It was during the Weltkrieg, where all the modern weapons of the world's leading nations were pitted against one another, that Becker's belief in technological supremacy as what won wars would become solidified. This mentality is what he brought with him to the HWA as soon as the guns fell silent.\n\nBecker has now become involved in virtually every scientific project of the Deutsches Heer, from rocketry to even secretive research in uranium.

The armor was experimental, but quite influential, especially during pivotal moments in the Kaiserschlacht. Early on, Volckheim began to understand the strengths and weaknesses of armor, notably that it could only function in conjunction with infantry support. He would complete the war as Germany's foremost "expert" on tank matters due to his practical knowledge, and would further develop this experience in the post-Weltkrieg world by developing the Kaiserreich's new "Panzertruppen" further.\n\nVolckheim would ultimately come into contact with Heinz Guderian, a general who also had been affected by tanks during his experiences in the German intervention in Russia, and the two would cooperate in developing their ideas. Volckheim, however, remained much more conservative than Guderian, and prefers a general motorization of the army and a strong core of armor rather than sweeping armored thrusts and Guderian's policy of nearly all operations revolving around tanks.

Upon his graduation in 1909, Richthofen joined a unit of Uhlans and served in reconnaissance on both fronts when the Weltkrieg began. Manfred grew especially bored with not participating in direct combat as the unit was downgraded to dispatch running, and he quit the branch entirely when he was ordered to transfer to the supply section of the army. He pursued a latent interest in aviation afterwards and applied for the Fliegertruppen, formally joining in 1915 as a recon pilot. After a meeting with ace Oswald Boelcke, Manfred volunteered as a fighter pilot by 1916 and scored his first victory in the same year. Richthofen’s credited kills steadily began to rise, mostly owing to his following of the “Dicta Boelcke”, and after his reception of the Pour le Mérite in 1917 he was granted command of the squadron that would later be known as the “Flying Circus”. Painting his aircraft all red and eventually earning the “Red Baron” title, Richthofen’s efforts were a major propaganda victory for the Germans, who proclaimed their air forces as invincible. Manfred would remain in a combat role throughout the war, believing that even if he was a “hero”, he had to perform the same duties as common soldiers.\n\nWith the Weltkrieg’s conclusion, Manfred von Richthofen was seen as an illustrious figure of the German military, but he had allowed pilots like Ernst Udet to take center stage in the following years. He refined what he had learned throughout his war service and consistently improved upon the practices that had ensured his victories, ultimately becoming the air force’s leading reformer. The Red Baron remains adamant that the Luftwaffe’s primary role should involve battles for air supremacy and conducting bombing campaigns, which has kept his proposed doctrine and technological advances heavily focused on fighters.§!"

Udet would later, via his connection to Gustav Otto, become trained as a pilot and join the Fliegertruppen in 1915. He quickly established himself as a formidable fighter, and joined Richthofen’s “Flying Circus” at the Red Baron’s request. Ernst continued his service in the Weltkrieg with a growing love for its flair, mockingly painting “Du doch nicht”, “definitely not you”, on the tail of his plane.\n\nAfter the Treaty of Versailles, Udet became a popular stunt pilot outside of his time as an instructor in the Luftstreitkräfte, and appeared in a great number of early films that focused on the Kaiserreich’s aerial combat. His fame, connections, and adoration for flying have secured him an enviable position high in the new Luftwaffe hierarchy, but his distaste of bureaucracy has notably harmed his career.

In 1916, he requested a transfer to the submarine forces after receiving a few awards for his naval service. A year later, he graduated from the submariner's school at Flensburg-Mürwik and served aboard the illustrious U-39, second most successful submarine of the war with 149 credited sinkings. Later appointed commander of the UC-25 and UB-68, Karl was completely convinced of the U-boat's potential as the Entente scrambled to counter these underwater threats and was only saved by the lacking numbers of the Kaiserreich's submarine force.\n\nIn the years following the end of the Weltkrieg, Dönitz had, alongside various collaborators such as Hermann Bauer, refined his theories on submarine warfare. Emerging modern technologies such as wireless communications, electric engines, and new cipher machines have made the submarine commander even more confident in the U-boat's ability to dominate the seas. He has argued extensively that faster vessels in massed "wolfpacks" are key to destroying the Kaiserreich's maritime opponents, which has put him at odds with disciples of the late Scheer and Hipper. Karl's support of unrestricted submarine warfare has also made him, at minimum, a controversial admiral, but his unparalleled expertise with U-boats has kept him close to the top of the Kaiserliche Marine.

He witnessed Tirpitz's construction of the High Seas Fleet firsthand, and the venerable admiral's "Risikotheorie" had a deep effect on Raeder's opinions regarding the German navy. The Weltkrieg would be the trial by fire for Tirpitz's creation, and Erich himself was put through a test in the Battle of Jutland. As Franz von Hipper, Erich's superior with a notable distaste for paperwork, delegated more tasks to his underlings, Raeder's experience and prestige grew in equal measure. Furthermore, Hipper's numerous ambitious plans of engaging the Royal Navy in the New World or waging a decisive battle of annihilation near the end of the Weltkrieg would be concepts which Raeder firmly took to heart.\n\nErich Raeder would continue a steady rise in the navy hierarchy throughout the OHL dictatorship and the succeeding Tirpitzian administration, becoming admiral by 1928. He was seen as a scion of the then retired old admirals Hipper and Tirpitz, and in that capacity he has remained firm in outlining the merit of heavy guns' firepower. For Raeder, the prestige of the Kaiserliche Marine is permanently tied to the behemoths that fly its flag, and the existence of such vessels themselves ensures that peace reigns over the Kaiserreich.

In September 1913, Strasser took command of the Naval Airship Division, and his interest in the unproven airship technology had made him obsessively diligent in this position. While his zeppelins during the Weltkrieg were a horrifying sight for the British, and Strasser himself used their fear to affirm the value of terror bombing, lackluster military results from the dirigibles put a black mark on all of his efforts. The Weltkrieg would end with Admirals Hipper and Scheer receiving most of glory won at sea while Strasser was snubbed, which only incensed his aggressively independent behavior further.\n\nStill committed to the concept of maritime air power, Strasser began to develop his own doctrinal theories. British experiments with flat-deck aircraft carriers easily aligned with Strasser's visions of the future of naval warfare, and he began to lobby Großadmiral Alfred von Tirpitz for support of a German carrier program. Kaiser Wilhelm II, consistently interested in "modern" technology, would offer his support when Tirpitz's chancellorship had begun and the Kaiserliche Marine was given renewed attention.

GER_quenched_militarism_desc:0 "The Kaiserreich's laurel wreath at the end of the Weltkrieg was bought at the price of over two million German lives, and it is a cost that has still remained hard for the people to stomach despite nationalist euphoria. While it has been long enough for a new generation to begin to take hold as the youth of Germany, there are many who recall never seeing their sons return home, and they wish to never suffer such a sensation ever again.\n\nWhile the military has yet to begin especially hurting in its recruitment targets, the once dominant thirst for war that was Prussian militarism has been slaked in the minds of the people, and it will take either a war of survival or a remarkably well-done round of propaganda and cultural renewal to bring that thirst back."

GER_totalist_party:0 "Spartakus, BdF"
GER_totalist_party_long:0 "Spartakus, Bund der Frontkämpfer\n§LSpartacus, League of Front-Line Fighters§!\n§gThe Spartacus League, once the largest association of leftists that Germany had ever seen and wielding enough power to threaten the government itself, now can only limp on as the far smaller BdF (League of Front-Line Fighters). The BdF was properly formed in 1919 in the aftermath of the November Uprisings by Heinrich Laufenberg alongside the disparate other survivors, with the rest of the Spartacists finding themselves dead or forced to live far beyond the borders of the German Empire. Laufenberg's leadership has seen the remnant group shift even further into far-leftism, now regarding the democratic socialism as promised by the USPD as being a dead end for revolutionary action, and so now the BdF finds itself in the same ranks as the Jacobins of France or the Maximists of Britain. The BdF itself stresses the importance of cooperation with these other far-left entities in order to complete the transformation of the German Empire into a communist society, and it also is known to cooperate with various other underground organizations within Germany itself. As wide of a faction as it is it still stresses the importance of Anti-imperialism, Marxism, and now National Bolshevism in the interest of the German proletariat.§!"
GER_syndicalist_party:0 "FAUD"
GER_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands\n§LFree Workers' Union of Germany§!\n§gThe FAUD is an anarcho-syndicalist trade union that enjoys the privilege of existence in the face of shutdown from the central government, despite its role within the November Uprisings. Either due to its size, its resentment towards the far-left, or the lack of direct action from its leader, Rudolf Rocker, the FAUD was mostly untouched and continues to organize workers predominantly in the Ruhr valley and various other industrial centers of the German Empire. This de jure lack of a crakdown however came with censure within newspapers and a ban on mass organization, and often politicians that find themselves openly aligned with the FAUD are pushed out of their parties in favor of other candidates. Regardless, despite these troubles, the FAUD has remained committed to the anarcho part of its platform, expressly due to the intellectual interests of Rocker himself, and so the FAUD tends to fail as an alternative to the SPD for the average worker. For the time being though, the FAUD remains the only substantial syndicalist group in the German Empire, preaching about the values of anarchism, anti-militarism, and anti-totalitarianism.§!"
GER_radical_socialist_party:0 "USPD"
GER_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§LIndependent Social Democratic Party of Germany§!\n§gThe USPD was formed in 1917 as the divide between anti-war SPD members and their party allies became too much for the former to bear, leading them to create their own radical party separate from the SPD. The USPD quickly became a hotbed of revolutionary thought and a safe haven for formerly exiled leftists within Germany, advocating pacifism, democratic socialism, and Marxism. Their political zenith would be found in the November Uprisings of 1918, where they would cooperate immensely with the Spartacus League in a direct revolution against the Reich government. The failure of these uprisings has evidently permanently crippled the USPD as a political force, with many of their charismatic leaders executed or exiled in the aftermath of the uprising. Now, the USPD is headed by the far-less-revolutionary Paul Levi, who continuously restricts the party from ever exercising anti-government violence ever again.§!"
GER_social_democrat_party:0 "SPD"
GER_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§LSocial Democratic Party of Germany§!\n§gOriginating in 1863, the SPD is one of the oldest parties in Germany. During the Weltkrieg, this strength was threatened when the SPD split in two between the "mainline" SPD and the radical anti-war USPD. After the failure of the November Uprisings, the party shifted further into nationalism to survive the German Red Scare. Despite prior government sanctions, the fall of Ludendorff allowed the SPD to join the Grand Coalition led by Tirpitz for the 1927 elections, pushing more anti-war and anti-imperialist members out of the party. While still supporting voting reform and welfare programs, a noticeable current of patriotism can also be seen. The SPD's voter block is the strongest among the lower classes and the industrial areas along the Rhine.§!"
GER_social_liberal_party:0 "FVP"
GER_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Fortschrittliche Volkspartei\n§LProgressive People's Party§!\n§gCreated in 1910, the FVP is the social liberal alternative to the NLP. The FVP was a staunch opponent of the Ludendorff Dictatorship, supporting political liberalisation and electoral reform. Thanks to the FVP's strong support among liberal civil servants, as well as its intellectual heavyweight and one of chief leaders Thomas Mann, it has easily become an effective opposition party. Nowadays the group represents interests of liberal elites, romantic nationalists, and large swaths of academia. Their platform includes wide electoral reform, liberalization of society, and heavy investment in the German culture.§!"
GER_market_liberal_party:0 "NLP"
GER_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Nationalliberale Partei\n§LNational Liberal Party§!\n§gCreated in 1866, the NLP began as a prominent backer of the Bismarck chancellorship. However, after his turn to the right the party's influence waned immensely. The NLP was powerless in the Reichstag during the Weltkrieg, especially as the center lost influence. After the rise of Tirpitz, the NLP joined the Great Coalition, supporting German colonialism, army expansion, and liberal economic policies. Stresemann's patriotism combined with the admission of Max Weber, famed sociologist, slowly transformed the NLP into a competitive force. Although historically close to the economic elite, Weber's growing popularity has brought more of the entrepreneurial middle-class, anti-Junker businessmen, and various individualistic academics to the party's fold.§!"
GER_social_conservative_party:0 "Zentrum"
GER_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Deutsche Zentrumspartei\n§LGerman Centre Party§!\n§gCreated in 1870, the Zentrum has traditionally represented German Catholics with the Kulturkampf hardening its federalist views. Later due to the actions of the leader of the parliamentary faction Matthias Erzberger, the party would be the architect of the Reichstag’s Peace Resolution of 1917. They would ultimately join with Tirpitz's Great Coalition in an effort to build broader appeal, but Erzberger's less than patriotic stance often hurt the group, leading to Franz von Papen's current de facto management of the party. Regardless, Zentrum has pulls in support of not only German Catholics but also anti-Centralization groups and disaffected workers unwilling to join the SPD. Recently as well, Papen's right-wing has pushed Zentrum into an uneasy coalition with the DkP, for the time being.§!"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "DkP"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Deutschkonservative Partei\n§LGerman Conservative Party§!\n§gThe DkP, founded in 1876, was deeply influential in the Bismarck era, leading the cause of protectionism and centralizing the new German state beneath Prussia. Ultimately, the party's power would wax and wane throughout the 1910s, especially as radical nationalism began to grow more popular during the Weltkrieg. The Ludendorff Dictatorship would slowly find the DkP pushed aside as the demagogue and his compatriots favored the DVLP. The DkP ultimately joined alongside other parties of the Great Coalition to maintain a hold in the government, sharing the some positions with the DVLP. After the 1927 elections, Kuno von Westarp began a deep rightward shift, opening light association with the Pan-German League and various rural movements in order to keep the party competitive against both the DVLP and the Zentrum. Currently, the DkP represents Junkers, most rural farmers, and the average German conservative.§!"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "DVLP"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Deutsche Vaterlandspartei\n§LGerman Fatherland Party§!\n§gFounded in 1917, the DVLP had its origin in the jingoism of the wartime German Empire, especially due to the influence of its founder Erich Ludendorff. It was with him that the party would enjoy the height of its power, functionally controlling the whole of the German Empire. However, the general's rule would not last, and his ignominious removal from power and scapegoating by the rest of the German right had sent the DVLP into a freefall. While the group has had to evolve much in the wake of Ludendorff's fall and its Great Coalition-era management under Alfred von Tirpitz, the platform's core has remained mostly same. Hoping to wield Empire's state organs for the 'righteous cause', the DVLP is known for reactionary monarchism, desire for pre-eminence of the military, and its far-right leanings in both economics and political orientation.

While seen as the origin point of the growingly powerful anti-parliamentary and illiberal 'Young Conservative' movement, he mostly exercises behind-the-scenes power incorporating influential figures within the arms of disparate political clubs beneath his influence. However, even with Moeller as the principle 'leader' of the DF, the movement's rhetoric changes intensively between its constituent groups. The DF's fractious nature has made it incapable of manifesting much in the way of electoral victory. This diversity is seen within its alignment of smaller parties such as the German Völkisch Party, Christian Social Party, and sections of the Free Conservative Party.§!"

While the exact gains to be had with these more mysterious, often dangerous, ventures are unknown, they claim to be capable of constructing weaponry that could change the very face of war itself. As Braun designs rockets capable of incinerating more than a bomber ever could and Heisenberg seems poised to unlock the power of the atom, the world may soon be forever changed by what is discovered by these Meister des Krieges."

We shall also grant more initiative to Mitteleuropa's member states when it comes to the rigidity of project planning. These states must now only adhere to goals rather than a direct plan, which should give them at least the illusion of choice. Lastly, the budgets of reconstructing our less fortunate neighbours shall be expanded to cement our role as Europe's first among equals.\n\nAll of our actions together will steadily show that Mitteleuropa is not just a flock of sheep led by the German lion, but rather a true union of nations standing together for a common ideal of a Europe of Nations.

There is, of course, nothing wrong with allowing the people a voice, after all every long-standing empire has given their constituents the means to govern. Yet the talks of reforming the class system or even permitting women to vote will only bring unwanted chaos to our state. It would be best, as has been shown time and time again with the workers growing ever more radical, to enact Prussia's three-class franchise across the whole of the Empire.\n\nThis will undoubtedly provoke revolt in Bavaria and the Rhineland, both regions already resisting Prussianist dogma with a bitter hatred, but in the interests of making sure only the proper people have a say in our government we must do whatever is necessary. The world is growing more violent, we can't leave our fate to an unrestricted ballot."

This "Schwarm" formation, which consists of two "Rotte", “pairs”, of fighters, is far more open and flexible than the older "Kette". The "Rottenführer" of each pair is tasked with attacking enemy aircraft, whereas his wingman will aid in a more defensive role.

Their main political fight is not too dissimilar from our cause, for they have been established in the wake of the “Suffrage Robbery” designed to ensure a total dominance of rich conservative forces on the council.

Emil’s deal was revolutionary, signalling the beginning of a private-public partnership type in Germany.\n\nDespite being forced by the Kaiser to establish Telefunken together with Siemens, Rathenau has long outcompeted him during the course of this friendly rivalry. The model of Deutsche Edison, of the Rathenaus, broke with the old industrialist way of having to be a specialist in the field to invest there.\n\nThe future of the Kaiserreich lies in aggressive acquisitions, in relegating the complex operations to qualified managers overseen by the Reichskanzler.

Bredow is, despite descending from old Moravian nobility, a man zealously devoted to both his Reichskanzler and the mission of reconfiguring Germany to fit their ambitions.\n\nThe daggers drawn shall not spill blood like the cruel and unusual creatures of the Freikorps do, they will instead act like tools of experienced surgeons. Whenever a neoplasm appears on the political body of the Kaiserreich the men of Bredow will be there, ready to pierce and remove the infestation.

Not only are they fiercely opposed to the socialist republic in the North, but the government in Naples perceives the Austrians as having abandoned them, leaving the door open for German investment. Furthermore, our relations with the Bourbon kings of Spain have been remarkably cordial, and so many of our diplomats believe it to be just a task of offering the right deal to Ferdinando III of Bourbon-Two Sicilies to get the good graces of his state.

This had, naturally, sparked the ire of the Spaniards that control the small strip of coastal Africa there to this day. Influenced by pressure from the United Kingdom, both sides agreed to cooperate in an effort of establishing a special international zone that would remain neutral in the world’s affairs.\n\nThe plan never came to fruition, for the War cut its implementation short and liquidated all French and British influence in the region. With our cordial relations to the Spanish monarchy and their grip on Tangier secured, perhaps we could make them a new offer, this time for the other pillar.\n\nGibraltar would be transformed into a special zone administrated by a joint committee of the Reichspakt and Madrid, naturally safeguarded by a German garrison.

However, ignoring it now would only allow the Russians an easy means to ultimately march on Kiev and existentially threaten our grain supply.\n\nHome to substantial coal producing mines and a large percentage of Mitteleuropa's agricultural output, this area must now be covered by a modern bunker system. While the Deutsches Heer considers a border defense practically impossible, various construction planners have proposed a series of fortification networks to instead 'funnel' any attacking armies into death traps where they could be destroyed by an arriving counter strike of German forces.

The Habsburgs have had to mend their splitting Empire during numerous Ausgleiche, most famously the 1867 Compromise which led to the formation of the Dual Monarchy.

The forest-dwelling natives were an obvious issue, yet the biggest hurdle came in form of the Russians. That backwards Tartaric breed, educated under the Mongolic yoke, never reached the stage due to which we could call them equals. The centuries of warfare and wanton violence were more than enough to prove it, with the Weltkrieg and the Civil War being the ultimate show of their true nature.\n\nThe Muscovite troglodytes still foolishly worship their old hero, Alexander Nevsky, who only delayed the inevitable by inflicting a stinging blow to our efforts during the so-called Battle on the Ice. But the Prince is long dead, Hermann von Buxhövden has been avenged, and Lake Peipus is under our control.

gerdom.1.d:0 "The Weltkrieg, that great and terrible war which forced the rising German Empire into confrontation with virtually all of its neighbors, had concluded with an undeniable German victory. The old rivals of Russia, France, and the United Kingdom were all left defeated and bloodied, more than a few falling to revolution, but this vindication of German supremacy did not come without its cost or insidious opportunists willing to abuse it. The Kaiser, who had angered the militarists Paul Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff through his refusal to enact unrestricted submarine warfare during the war, slowly saw his own power sapped from him as these titans of the OHL formed a de facto military junta.\n\nThe Dictatorship's true founding moment would be in the November Uprisings of 1918, which saw the Spartacist League lead a mass wave of worker discontent against the regime, inspired by their red comrades in Russia and the simmering discontent of France. The millions of lives lost in the Weltkrieg shackled the populace to the fear of a nightmare where this hard-fought victory could all be lost in the flash of an eye. In this cursed world of strife, the people surrendered towards the whims of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, who formed the DVLP alongside Wolfgang Kapp and Alfred von Tirpitz to add political legitimacy to their nascent autocracy. The uprisings were crushed, and an intervention in Russia snuffed out the Bolshevik flame before it could turn Europe to naught but ashes, but further pre-emptive war against France was prevented by one Kurt von Schleicher, then Reichskommissar for Nancy, ordering his units to focus on internal dissent instead.\n\nThis rift in the Deutsches Heer's direction steadily ballooned until Ludendorff was unable to demand more conflict, and the war machine of the Empire finally began to slow down. The Kaiser himself took note, and the close call was an impetus for Tirpitz's distancing from the regime..."

gerdom.1001.d:0 "While the first post-war election in 1922 saw a massive surge of support for the DVLP, the lack of a decisive battle against France and the leeway given to the remainder of Germany's enemies already set a slow build-up of civil discontent against the OHL Dictatorship in motion. This discontent exploded as Erich Ludendorff was implicated in a scandal rife with corruption and blatant autocracy, a wealth of private communique and deals with Junker estates revealed by unknown private sources. Kaiser Wilhelm II, already chafing at the fact that his empire was run by someone other than himself, took the opportunity to officially demand Ludendorff's resignation as general, and Ludendorff's allies Alfred von Tirpitz, Wolfgang Kapp, and even Paul Hindenburg had all abandoned him to his fate. The former dictator retired and had unofficially quit politics, while Tirpitz was left to pick up what remained of the DVLP when the other main leaders had decided to enjoy the spoils of victory in a more graceful retirement.\n\nAlfred von Tirpitz's governance of the Empire oversaw the creation of the 'Grand Coalition', a successful attempt to shift many party platforms towards the right wing, and the best years the German economy had ever seen in growth and wealth. It was easy for Tirpitz, viewed as a true representative of all sectors of the Empire's interests, to maintain control up until his death in 1930, the resulting vacuum leaving the DVLP headless and sending German politics into chaos. The elections in 1932 would see a DkP-Zentrum coalition easily take hold, painting itself as a choice of stability in uncertain times.\n\nKuno von Westarp, the new Reichskanzler, now stands as the head of such a coalition, yet the years of his tenure have been unkind. The powers surrounding Germany are once more sharpening their swords, and the costs of economic isolation are finally showing their ugly faces. The 'boom' of Tirpitz's reign seems poised to collapse just as the world turns towards conflict once more, but the German people have weathered many tests that would have broken weaker nations.

The new constitutional framework created integrated the southern states into the Prussian-led Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the Empire is a federation of twenty-five German states. The title of Bundespräsidium, or Federation President, was held by the King of Prussia, a figure now invested with the title of Emperor of Germany. The Emperor directly appoints the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws are enacted by both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the lower house Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years.\n\nWith an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire actually rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained mostly unchanged since 1849.\n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with the status quo and our constitution may need revision soon to help us weather the upcoming turbulence..."

However, it would be foolish to say that it was just the men who contributed to the cause. Indeed, the women of the empire proved themselves to be just as diligent and essential to the war effort despite staying in the homefront. A great number of them have found work in factories to ensure production of both military and civilian goods, replacing the men who had been conscripted into the military and, in some cases, bolstering the efficiency of production further than we could have ever anticipated in these dire times. Not only that, but patriotic women have been invaluable to our fundraising for the war efforts and creation of propaganda. Time and time again they have proven themselves just as, if not perhaps more, than capable in doing the work of their husbands, fathers, brothers, and sons.\n\nNone have utilized this trend more than the suffragettes, however, who have exploded in popularity and influence since the beginning of the war. Their movement began as a minor voice in the political sphere here in Germany, but now they are clamoring, with their new-found support across the country, for equal rights and total emancipation in all fields of society. The most controversial of these demands is the right to vote, as well as the right to participate in the highest level of politics, including the right to run for leadership of the nation.

Many industrialists and financiers are now relocating their industries and remaining capital to countries less affected by the Black Monday, mainly foreign investment havens such as Costa Rica or other major powers like Japan.\n\nThis domino effect is making the Empire's current crisis even worse, and despite appeals for calm from the Reichskanzler and Hermann Warbold, the State Secretary for Economic Affairs, it would appear that we can expect the phenomenon of capital flight from the entire Mitteleuropa to intensify in the coming weeks. Since our economy is mainly based on large conglomerates such as Siemens and Krupp, whose resources are still chiefly based in the Fatherland, we are spared from falling into total financial meltdown. Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly clear that a resolute and decisive response from the cabinet will be needed as soon as possible, in spite of the political tensions and conflicts within the ruling DkP-Zentrum coalition, if we do not want to see the triumphs of yesteryears to be turned into dust."

Having neither tangible proof nor knowledge of the possible outcome, the Reichskanzler is forced into inaction, but if these rumors would be proven true it might spell out disaster for the Reichskanzler.

gerdom.19.d:0 "One of the sectors which unfortunately suffered the most from the Black Monday was military pensions. Many of our patriotic and accomplished Weltkrieg veterans are forced to count on their pensions to survive, having been left unable to find any job providing a decent wage. Whether it is due to major psychological trauma from the horrors of war or physical injuries, ranging from amputation of limbs to almost complete invalidity, these proud sons of the Fatherland are thus dependant on the state. Understandably, the boiling discontent with the system they have fought so hard to preserve has only grown with the reduction in the amounts of pensions they received, a tragic measure we had to take in order to reduce our expenses and hopefully survive the crisis.\n\nSeveral veterans' associations from across the Empire, such as Theodor Duesterberg's faction within Der Stahlhelm fanned by his benefactor Hugenberg or Der Wehrwolf and its enigmatic leader Fritz Kloppe, have organized an enormous march in the imperial capital of Berlin, denouncing what they perceive as an abandonment of the most devoted and courageous sons by the Kaiser and his government. Faced with demands of a return to the pre-1936 pensions, and even their considerable increase, our government is obviously incapable of responding to the veterans at the moment. Ultimately, this march marks another blow to the precarious stability of Kuno von Westarp's DkP-Zentrum coalition."

gerdom.20.t:0 "DkP Crippled by Infighting"
gerdom.20.d:0 "As much as the dominant party of the ruling coalition may hold the interests of Germany and its people as a priority, it does not guard them from intense and bitter factionalism so characteristic of recent Imperial politics. Indeed, despite the support base of the DkP being traditionally Junkers, predominantly the ones holding grand estates in Eastern Germany, the economic calamity drove a sizeable and vocal conservative minority to criticize the status quo inherited from the party's history. They claim that in the face of the great challenges strangling Germany's most vulnerable, poor farmers and rural workers, the DkP ought to turn their attention to them lest they fall victim to Socialist agitation.\n\nThis tendency is represented by the Christian-National Peasants' and Farmers' Party, or simply the CNBL, which continues to grow in popularity among conservatives. Despite Reichskanzler Kuno von Westarp's best efforts to navigate the rivers of factionalism within his party the hard task of maintaining a semblance of stability in the post-Tirpitz political camp has so far turned out mostly fruitless. It remains to be seen if the divisions that are damaging the DkP will shatter their chances of receiving the support of the German electorate once again."

gerdom.2102.t:0 "The Urban Warzone"
gerdom.2102.d:0 "The cities of Germany are being bathed in chaos, as reports have been flooding in from across the country depicting a grim situation unfurling before us. On our streets across the nation, political groups from both the far-left and the far-right have begun brawling, attacking one another on sight. These terrible fights often start out as political protests against the current government and its failure in containing the fallout from Black Monday, but as soon as they take to the streets, they are ambushed by their political rivals who catch wind of their movements through an informant. In some bizarre cases, these protests happen simultaneously, causing the two groups to cross paths and end up fighting one another on the spot.\n\nMuch to our shame, the police have been little help in resolving this matter. If being unable to stop the street fights was not bad enough, there have been terrible rumours that they are in-fact aiding the far-right groups. Through turning a blind eye to the offenses committed by the Rightists, or even directly aiding them in brawls, batons and all, it has only caused greater outrage from all sides towards the government and its clear inability to handle the chaos.\n\nThat goes without mentioning the constant news of robberies and break-ins, reaching an all-time high in the last few days. Most have gotten away with it too, taking advantage of the riots and fights distracting the police. Although a majority of the robbers are common criminals and petty thieves, there are quite a few amongst their ilk who are acting out of pure desperation, having lost all their money with no hope of ever getting it back. If this goes on for much longer, it might spiral completely out of our hands."

Some were optimistic at first, and believed that they would weather the economic storm just as easily as they did before - how wrong they were. The compounding damage that Black Monday has left in its wake struck them harder than they could have ever anticipated. It was as though their wealth vanished into thin air, leaving only the bitterness of the reality before them.\n\nAs a result, many of these families have been forced to sell their estates or even their very homes, unable to afford to maintain these old sites, for just a little bit of extra money in their pockets. For many of them, it is a great tragedy, for they must abandon the homes of their ancestors that in many cases stretches back generations. For those that live in the regions where these aristocrats once dwelled, notably East Elbia, it is eerily silent. Ancient castles and manors that dot the countryside remain dark and lifeless, haunted by memories."

gerdom.2106.d:0 "Much to the chagrin of most of the Cabinet, Erich Ludendorff, the disgraced general, has apparently broken his self-imposed silence in order to speak today in the papers lambasting the government for its failure to contain the results of Black Monday, taking the time to explain how if he was still in charge, none of this would have happened whatsoever. One of the most controversial statements he made was that the Kaiser must step in, suggesting perhaps that he must replace the government in the same manner that he had done during the Tirpitzian years against Ludendorff.\n\nDespite the excitement that this sudden break of silence has brought, the general remains a heavily unpopular figure due to his autocratic tendencies which were on full display before the ‘Golden Years’ of Tirpitz’s government, as well as the fact he was forced by the Kaiser to resign as General. Nevertheless, he still holds sway in the political scene of today, as many amongst the far-right admire him and his political perspective. There are also elements within the military which still support him - a matter of habit, if not genuine respect. It might seem like he is merely using the opportunity to further his own agenda in a petty manner, but there is nothing we can do about it at this moment."

Political violence is anticipated to escalate, with vigorous discourse from various factions and potential controversies arising.

The extent of this effort now depends on what we wish to achieve from this meeting. Do we wish to start anew with the Holy Father and strengthen our ties with the Catholic Church, perhaps going so far as to invest into our more Catholic regions as a sign of good faith, or instead maintain a steady and formal relationship? Although the former may grant us a potential ally within the Italian peninsula, it may alienate our coalition partners who see a closer relation to the church as a betrayal of our heritage and nationalist ideals.

Even the Rhineland, home to millions of workers, has not manifested any meaningful leftist resistance to the regime in Berlin, much to the delight of the government. The rest of the world, however, is not so complacent with the present dominance of "international capital", and so civil wars and revolutions of all sorts have sprung up across the globe.\n\nSeeing all of this chaos as opportunity, leftist paramilitary leader Wilhelm Zaisser has initiated the creation of a German "International Division" that would participate in one of the ongoing conflicts abroad. He now proclaims to the few followers he has that German participation in the world revolution, and the shedding of their blood in that process, will show that the German people are not completely lost to the whims of the Kaiser. The Reich Security agencies, meanwhile, seem more than willing to turn a blind eye to Zaisser's "brigade" leaving the country, assuredly hoping that he and the rest of his brethren die in bitter conflicts elsewhere.\n\nOf course, Zaisser could always just stay in Germany, and fruitlessly organize for a red revolution that will never truly manifest.

Meanwhile, Reichskanzler Hugenberg will work to ensure that Germany's "bellicose" foreign policy be shown to still have energy.

While government efforts in the sphere of propaganda are still ongoing, constantly attempting to display the full splendor of our wondrous conquests, there have been some suggestions for a far more "decisive" propaganda campaign than simple posters, paid headlines, and interviews.\n\nEven as the state budget remains under close scrutiny, more than a few idealistic civil servants have tried to persuade the Reichskanzler towards the funding of a massive film project, with a flagship title that will likely end up as the most expensive movie ever produced in Germany. So far, only the concept of creating a leading film, alongside companion productions on a smaller scale, has been gaining traction amongst the DkP. The world of films has already shown its use in capturing the minds of the people more than any other medium, and most DkP members have grown affectionate towards the "Kinoprojekt", claiming it will help shake off their image as an "unchanging" force.\n\nThe conservative bureaucracy might not be the most well-versed in making movies, but thanks to the full resources of the state every possible director, film subject, and actor is up for the taking in order to ensure total artistic success. In the best case scenario, the budget may even be fully recouped in mesmerizing profits alongside mobilizing our people into loving Germany as much as they had before!"

gerdom.285.d:0 "After much deliberation which ended with us picking a concrete theme for the coming cinematic work, we are now faced with an even tougher decision. Who shall be given the reins of this potential cinematic masterpiece?\n\nAs the funding is not an issue, due to the Universum-Film AG receiving full support Chancellery, the question facing the board is who could be up to the task of creating a masterwork in propaganda. It will take a person who is not afraid to treat the subject with the respect it deserves, and thus even some notable directors such as Robert Siodmak, Ernst Lubitsch or F. W. Murnau have been already excluded pending certain qualms about the specifics of their current work and character.\n\nTo expedite the process a special group made up of experts from the Deutschkonservative Partei and the UFA formulated a final list of four directors that could be tasked with the monumental job before them. The first, and most promising according to many within the cabinet, is Veit Harlan. While so far mostly known for acting, he has created a few dramas which show that there is potential in the young filmmaker, especially as he's not related to any explicitly public political movement according to our investigation. The second, and perhaps more surprising, is Victor Tourjansky, a Russian émigré that left his homeland during the outbreak of the Civil War and then moved to Germany from his temporary abode in Crimea after the intervention was over. Despite the cries of the most rightist elements of the party, others note that immigrants have already proven themselves as directors in other nations, pointing to the fame acquired by Charlie Chaplain after he moved to the USA. The third, and more conventional of choices compared to Tourjansky yet still with notable worries, is Karl Ritter. On the surface, he’d be a perfect candidate, a Weltkrieg veteran who turned his gaze towards the cinema business. Yet, what concerns the moderates within our party is that Ritter is open about his far-right views, and could influence the movie's final shape to fit Schleicherist, or worse, perspectives, something that the supporters of the fighter pilot shoot down by reminding us of the popularity of D. W. Griffith's radically political "The Birth of a Nation". The final choice, the most exotic of all, would be to hire Leni Riefenstahl. As strange as it may seem to hire a young woman, even borderline heretical according to many within our party, she has already proven herself by her work on the "Unser Kampf" film project. Not only that, but they also note that female directors are capable of creating impactful movies like the work of Alice Guy-Blaché proves. Riefenstahl could be convinced to work for the state on future propaganda pieces, but would also provide a boost in our perception among the women's movement.\n\nA final decision will ultimately be made, the UFA knows that it cannot delay the subject forever, but any proposal they announce must meet with the approval of the Reichskanzler. So who shall the man, or woman, that will carry the German people towards a great triumph on the screen be?"

While Ritter is firm in making the stunts theatrical in measure, his understanding of what is possible for a pilot to accomplish has resulted in a shockingly low amount of accidents on set, which other aviation-focused films can only be envious over.\n\nRitter, thanks to his background, has been able to garner respect from some of the leading actors, resulting in some promising displays through the camera. While the man's own flying days are behind him, his dedication to the filming craft has made him confident that this piece will inspire a new generation towards the Luftwaffe. The news has assuaged a bit of anxiety among the DkP, who wondered if fixating upon pilots and their bombastic behavior would only spell a total disaster.\n\nOf most use, however, is Ritter's capacity for maximizing his budget effectively. While some of the spending has raised a few eyebrows, the effect has been quite substantial. Not only is there a wide array of shots taken of the ground, the pilots affecting an ongoing battle beneath them, but the money spent has led to most of the used planes being able to be painted and reworked in a manner befitting the illustrious, near fantastical, appearances of the Red Baron's old Flying Circus.

With a reputation that is both illustrious and full of grievous mistakes, the Deutscher Ritterorden presently exists outside of the Kaiserreich's influence due to Prussia exiling them to Austria where they remain. While the Peace of Augsburg had permitted Protestants and Reformed Christians to participate, the group has remained predominantly Catholic, especially due to its aforementioned Austrian residency. Now however, Zentrum leads the German nation, constituting Protestants and Catholics alike. Due to this, there has been a suggestion from our more traditionalist party members that we should create a Teutonic Order for our own uses here in the Vaterland.\n\nThere already exist numerous Catholic and Protestant organizations across the Kaiserreich, but our new Deutscher Orden, independent from the knights in Austria yet closely cooperating with them, would try and unite both branches of the Christian faithful into a common purpose. While this has made proponents of keeping Zentrum "in the tower" wary, such members of our party are still swayed by the promise of traditional value that investing in this project could bring. Zentrum members who wish for the party to start pulling in more of the Protestant members of the Reich, meanwhile, are ecstastic in their support of the idea.\n\nThe Kaiserreich cannot rest idle on these spiritual matters, not when it bears the responsibility of the paramount power of the world. The threat of syndicalism and the radical far-right has been concerning, and so the Reichskanzler has agreed to the formation of this much-debated chivalrous creed. Within these pious modern knights shall be the salt of our nation and its people, the Pope having recently granted his cautious support.

He has already offered some of the large estates of his family, including the Schloss at Groß Stein, to the still embryonic order to help it along. He has additionally proven himself through being admitted to the elite Gardes du Corps and his numerous escape attempts from the French after being captured in 1914. While the question of whether or not to militarize the order remains tabled during our ongoing discussions, Hyazinth will undoubtedly be able to competently manage his men in a martial capacity.\n\nThe second option, meanwhile, is Wichard von Alvensleben, an aristocrat and Knight of the Order of Saint John. The aforementioned order, also known as the Bailiwick of Brandenburg, is a German Protestant branch of the Knights Hospitaller, joining alongside the obsessively-noble Dutch Bailiwick of Utrecht as an example of already extant Protestant knight orders. Wichard, though not necessarily a military man and instead trained in forestry, has shown a willingness to become educated in such matters should the need arise.\n\nWhile both of these prospective Hochmeister would be acceptable, even capable, choices, there can of course be only one Grand Master.

Citing factors such as a lack of confidence after the Black Monday Crisis, and the monolithic nature of the cartels controlling the German economy, they demand that we do more to facilitate the creation of new businesses among the Mittelstand.\n\nAfter much deliberation, the government has decided that what it needs is a "success story" of a smaller business growing from a humble size into a major enterprise. While there were many candidates for the task, the most promising of them is the recently established Afri-Cola, a German equivalent to the ever popular Coca-Cola. Although it has yet to make much of a presence compared to its American competitor, the potential is certainly present within the brand to become an internationally renowned product.\n\nTo truly instill a spirit of the free market in our population, it needs to see that even a business unrelated to the powerful industrial cartels is capable of breaking through, it only requires some will and perseverance. The National Liberal government will thus support Afri-Cola's ventures to expand in the post-Crisis Germany. Of course, it must be done carefully, for if anyone finds out that the state is meddling too much we risk betraying our platform of genuine capitalism. It'll be quite the balancing act between trying to help the brand succeed and let it find its own footing, but it’s not something out of the realm of possibilities if we maintain a laissez-faire attitude for the most part."

gerdom.3520.t:0 "Afri-Cola - Range of Flavors"
gerdom.3520.d:0 "The first matter to attend to when it concerns the expansion of the Afri-Cola brand is flavor, or rather the introduction of a new taste for the drink. After a meeting between the government's representatives and the creator of the cola, Karl Flach, we have two options set before us.\n\nThe first is directly tied to the high caffeine content of the original recipe for Afri-Cola. While it is enjoyed plenty by those who have a taste for it, it has yet to really establish itself as a hit among the upper classes or state employees. Many have attributed this to the drink's composition as well as its color, the darker "coke" color being tied perceptually with the lower classes. That's why a group within our cabinet has concocted a plan for a "clear Afri-Cola" that would lower the caffeine amount and additionally make the drink closer in appearance to water. While it is not something any of the current consumers asked for, and it likely wouldn't succeed anywhere outside of the elite, having the drink penetrate this notoriously hard to please class could grant the government great returns.\n\nThe second option, directly based on the plans outlined by Karl Flach himself, is a creation of an entirely distinct drink. Bluna, as it was dubbed by its creator, would be a new soft drink with a distinct orange flavor with a bright color to match, as opposed to the orthodox coke taste of Afri-Cola. People supportive of Flach’s idea believe that the addition of a wholly new flavor and also the drink's design itself will be a big hit with the wider population of Germany. The main obstacle is the Empire's protectionist market, which would require our diplomats to work overtime in an effort of establishing a reliable trade deal to secure the amount of oranges we'd need to support the venture.\n\nWe could also, of course, leave Afri-Cola's range as it was before the implementation of our Mittelstand programme. While it may take longer to establish a dominant position with just one product on offer, we could surely mitigate it with investments in other areas such as the marketing. Our citizens already enjoy the taste of Flech's invention so why experiment needlessly?"

gerdom.3549.d:0 "The foreign policy of the Kaiserreich has been fraught with mistakes, needless aggression, and actions that have made our nation a pariah state. For the FVP, however, this state of affairs does not have to persist, and so the party has been coordinating a push to completely reform Germany's image abroad. The first step of this new diplomatic maneuvering is approaching one of the nations in our sphere we had wronged during the Weltkrieg and its aftermath, and offering compensation for our poor conduct against them. Three nations have been prepared for the first step of this diplomatic push, and while all of them undoubtedly need aid, the Foreign Office can only undertake one project at the moment.\n\nThe first, and undoubtedly in most dire need of our support, is the land of the Flemish and Walloon people. It is undeniable that the military policy of Flamenpolitik, alongside the internationally condemned "Rape of Belgium", was an egregious act on our part. We have rightfully incurred the eternal ire of the Belgian people, and our state has been intolerably lax in punishing those responsible for the worst of crimes conducted by the Heer. Some of our diplomats are convinced that an attempt to get the Belgian people on our side is an impossible task, but if we are to succeed in reorienting their views then it would be an immense aid to our future goals.\n\nThe second option presented has been Lithuania, which had nearly been annexed into the German state itself due to the madman Ludendorff's annexationist plans. The policy of the Ober Ost as well remains a black mark that the Lithuanian people have yet to forgive us for. While the Lithuanians certainly have many grievances with the Kaiserreich, many of our diplomats regard efforts with them to be fruitful, if still difficult.\n\nThe third, and easiest, option is a diplomatic effort in White Ruthenia. The region had suffered large degrees of depopulation during the Weltkrieg and subsequent interventions into the Russian Civil War, and it remains, even compared to the other Oststaats, in a state that many hesitate to call "modern". This would in truth make improving relations with Ruthenia rather "easy", considering what they most need is just industrial investment, but our returns on the diplomatic stage will comparatively not be as rewarding.\n\nThe right-wing still grumbles at the prospect of conceding to these "defeated nations" at all, but the health of our long-term leadership of the world depends on our allies being loyal rather than coerced. The choice now remains with the Reichskanzler."

gerdom.3550.d:0 "The Entente may have propagandized and even fabricated tales of atrocities in Belgium to a level that befits their tabloid-press, but it's undeniable that our conduct there was truthfully beyond the pale. In then Kanzler Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg's own words, the Treaty of London which guaranteed Belgium's neutrality was a "scrap of paper". This attitude that Belgium had simply been an obstacle in the path of the German war machine had translated into a ruthless occupation where thousands of civilians had died and many more had been deported to work in Germany. The memories of the pillaging, massacres, and the lethal electric fence, the "Wire of Death", still hang heavy over the Belgian populace. It was this brutality that brought the United Kingdom into the Weltkrieg, and reforming our geopolitical stance will have to involve apologizing and repaying the victims for this wanton barbarism committed by our army.\n\nThere have been innumerable suggestions for what the state could, and should, do to resolve the rift between ourselves and the Belgians. Tolerable to nearly every party of the Reichstag save for the DVLP is simply making a formal apology to the people of Belgium on behalf of the Kaiser and the army, but most of the Foreign Office isn't optimistic that it'd work. "Empty words that have come too late", in their view, and so their recommendation is to create a commission that offers restitution to victims of our wartime policies alongside the public apology.\n\nMore ambitious members of the FVP, however, have concluded that even the Foreign Office's plan doesn't go far enough. They suggest the creation of a war memorial in Brussels dedicated to the lost civilian lives and the fighting of the Belgian army. Resistance from the right-wing of the Reichstag, and even those within the FVP itself, has been deeply pronounced to the memorial plan, but it has gained a lot of traction among our more radical allies and membership. The construction would also include the other two prior plans, and would involve the most effort on the part of the government.\n\nWhile it may certainly be possible that the Belgians will remain indignant towards the Kaiserreich even if we go ahead with any of these diplomatic missions, that should not preclude us from making an honest effort in the first place. After our initial moves in making our intentions clear to the Belgians, then we can set about exercising justice against the war criminals that have tainted the Deutsches Heer."

While the worst of radical leftist violence has been laid to rest with the end of the November Uprisings, dissident sentiments have been steadily on the rise in recent years since the dissolution of the Grand Coalition. Nowhere has this been more prevalent than in the Rhineland, where it's been all but confirmed that foreign agents are at work trying to mobilize good and honest Germans against their Empire.\n\nThe scale of seditious literature and pamphlets being distributed has become threatening, with many claiming that the Communards are coming to "liberate" the German worker from a system that will never truly emancipate him. Further still, pacifistic discussions have been taking an even more radical bend, with recruitment offices in Essen and Cologne being vandalized and posters asking "Why die for Nancy?" are covering Rhenish alley walls. Shockingly, none of the circulated material has called for violent action against the government, rather the focus has been on hindering our war efforts in various non-violent means. Before our ascent to power, this ongoing espionage was being fiercely investigated by the rightist government of Westarp, with many trade union members being arrested on suspicion of being connected to this nebulous web of French sympathizing.\n\nWith the SPD in control of the Reichstag, however, we can ensure that the problem is handled with tact and grace. We must do our best to only go after those who might be involved with the plot itself, for chasing ghosts or dead ends will not only inflame paranoia but also push the snakes deep underground."

While it has been easy for many to blame the USPD or Laufenberg's Bund, the primary leads our agents have picked up on are neither.\n\nThe first leads are claims, which our predecessors had taken very seriously, of a secretly armed force of syndicalists and Jacobin-led thugs. While such a group has yet to show itself, this "Ruhr Red Army" as some have taken to calling it has continuously cropped up as the source of our ongoing woes.\n\nThe second lead is the intellectual circle "Neu Beginnen" which contains various pacifist thinkers, formerly active USPD politicians, and even several SPD party members in its ranks. The group publicly dedicates itself to furthering leftist unity and attempting to solve debates in theory and economics. Alongside its vision of a future where Germany is reformed into a people's republic, however, it has come under scrutiny for its resistance to the "militarism" of the status quo Social Democrats.\n\nThe third lead concerns the Gruppe Sozialrevolutionärer Nationalisten, a small Sorelian faction led by the journalist Karl Otto Paetel. Despite attempts at censure and even governmental harassment, Paetel has remained deeply resistant and continues to self-publish material in Germany and distribute translations of Georges Valois' political works. The GSRN's overt sympathy for the Commune of France is certainly seditious, and their size would make any genuine crackdown rather simple.\n\nAs this is our first move against the "Rhenish Ring", we have to ensure we strike where the dissidence is centered, or else we will quickly lose the initiative against the Communard menace among us. Unfortunately, our resources and lack of support from the Abwehr only permit us to target one organization."

gerdom.3710.d:0 "It has been an almost cruel irony that the most venomous of Reichskanzler Schleicher's enemies have not come from rabble-rousing syndicalists, Communard infiltrators, or even spineless politicians of the Reichstag. Instead, it is the aging aristocrats of the Reich's high society that most stalwartly refuse to march to the new tune of the reborn Germany. A few have been paid off or coerced thus far, but Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau, a friend of the former dictator Hindenburg, has become a shield for masses of dissident Junkers. Elard himself has made it clear that he will not align with the Reichskanzler due to what he sees as a flagrant betrayal of German tradition, and has burned every offering sent his way.\n\nThe government must, using all means at its disposal, target every asset he uses to resist. This baron's wealth from his endless farms, coveted military connections, and even the prestige and influence of the Ostelbian estates must be targeted. As this old, embittered man loses everything he has, then the countless barons who find safety in his shadow will realize that nothing in the Reich can escape the encroaching spectral state.\n\nOnly then will the orchestra of the "Red General" be able to play without the sniveling jeers of lesser creatures interrupting its melody. With the aid of the "Hidden King" Moeller van den Bruck, Ferdinand von Bredow's extralegal agents, and the numerous favors that Schleicher has gained throughout his tenure, it is only a matter of time before Oldenburg-Januschau's throne crumbles beneath him."

gerdom.3711.t:0 "Manufactured Pestilence"
gerdom.3711.d:0 "Many of Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau's profits, like the rest of the baronial ilk, come from his agrarian holdings. Protectionist policies, widely popular before the Weltkrieg and remaining in effect as recently as the Tirpitizian era, have allowed Elard to both line his pockets and use the amassed wealth to resist Schleicher's economic reforms. The Junker's innumerable fiefdoms and his pervasive hold over the Bund der Landwirte have thus far remained difficult to bypass or neuter, but an opportunity has finally presented itself.\n\nThe ceaseless conflict between the aristocrats and the Reichskanzler has resulted in Oldenburg-Januschau tightening his grip over his assets, leading to the workers in his employ becoming notably displeased due to their dwindling wages and benefits, especially as the sting of Black Monday remains fresh in their minds. Bredow's agents are convinced that a powder keg has been set in East Prussia, and a single spark could provoke a strike or worse. Elard, not immune to Black Monday himself, would likely not survive a mass disruption of profits, and his cronies have even less hopeful prospects.\n\nFerdinand von Bredow has suggested that an "incident" between a foreman and a worker could be manufactured to quickly turn the simmering dissent into overt violence, but while such a move would certainly succeed it could have after effects that do more damage than we'd appreciate. Moeller, meanwhile, has suggested instead that Fritz Kloppe, one of his close allies, could be relied on to goad the restless farmers into action. While a promise of a non-violent resolution may seem enticing, trusting the Wehrwolf to organize the masses with their anti-bourgeois tint might only cause the gospel of Possedism to spread beyond our control. Lastly, Schleicher still remains in the good graces of the L-C-H Gruppe, who are more than willing to assist the government in crippling the Ostelbian aristocrats that plague the "People's Community".\n\nAny operation against Oldenburg-Januschau and his allies carries with it risks of ruining East Prussia's productivity for the forseeable future, but the government will surely weather such a storm with less issues than the petty barons can. The choice of how to proceed remains with Schleicher."

Our substantial border fortifications were seemingly unable to stop their inexorable advance and now our crucial industrial cities are falling one after another. The situation is quite dire, and already there are treasonous murmurings that the Communards could reach Berlin itself."
gerfor.25.a:0 "They must be stopped!"

gerfor.26.t:0 "Fate of Spanish Morocco"
gerfor.26.d:0 "With Syndicalist forces taking control of Spain our colonial possessions in North Africa might be endangered. As a preventive measure our general staff has suggested that we occupy Spanish Morocco before the CNT-FAI stabilise their rule and spread their foul influence into our colonies."
gerfor.26.a:0 "Occupy Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.26.b:0 "Dirt piles are beneath our concern right now."

gerfor.27.t:0 "Germany Occupies Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.27.d:0 "The German Empire, in a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."
gerfor.27.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
gerfor.27.b:0 "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

gerfor.28.t:0 "Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.28.d:0 "The island of Madagascar has been under our rule for several decades and it is an untapped source of rare timbers like ebony and several varieties of rosewood. As these sources have not been exploited, several industrialists and members of the colonial government have proposed that we establish a joint-stock company with authority over the timber industry on the island. Shall we decree the establishment of such a company?"
gerfor.28.a:0 "Create a new joint-stock company."
gerfor.28.b:0 "Leave the industry alone."

gerfor.29.t:0 "Expanded Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.29.d:0 "The joint-stock company that we established has began to show some results and our inventory of rare timber has steadily increased. However, with the mechanisation of logging, several thousand locals have been put out of work. The company has at the same time advised that we begin construction on a new timber processing plant to streamline production. If we were to fund this new project it would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."
gerfor.29.a:0 "Create the new processing complex."
gerfor.29.b:0 "In this economy?"

gerfor.30.t:0 "New Madagascan Processing Complex"
gerfor.30.d:0 "The new timber processing complex has opened and the transformative effects on the local economy were immediate. Many workers responsible for the initial construction were retained by the company and many new workers were needed after construction was complete, dramatically increasing employment in the area. The access to rare timbers has also increased and a gala was held in Tananarive to toast the new complex's opening."
gerfor.30.a:0 "A successful colonial endeavour."

gerfor.31.t:0 "Uprising on Madagascar"
gerfor.31.d:0 "With no end in sight to the rising unemployment on Madagascar, many Malagasy locals, and especially the former loggers, have risen against us. What started as merely a local insurrection quickly spiralled into outright rebellion with an independence war brewing."
gerfor.31.a:0 "We really don't need this right now..."

gerfor.32.t:0 "A Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.32.d:0 "With the fall of France our armed forces have unsuccessfully tried to gain control over the British Isles and decisively end the war in our favour. Unfortunately, Republican resistance has proven stronger than we previously anticipated, and attempts to launch a full-scale naval invasion have soured. We can now either continue the armed struggle or try to end this futile conflict by way of a peace treaty."
gerfor.32.a:0 "It is time for an armistice."
gerfor.32.b:0 "This will only end with German boots marching through London."

gerfor.33.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.33.d:0 "Attempts from the Reichspakt to gain a foothold on our island and decisively end the war have failed miserably. Though the collapse of the Commune was a terrible blow to the Revolutionary cause, British arms have proven to be too much for Jerry to handle. Now the leadership of the German Empire is offering us a proposal - to terminate conflict between the Reichspakt and the remaining members of Internationale in exchange for mutual recognition. How shall we react?"
gerfor.33.a:0 "Survival is all we can hope for. Sign."
gerfor.33.b:0 "Another humiliation? Never again!"

gerfor.34.t:0 "Second Peace with Honour Signed"
gerfor.34.d:0 "It is finally done. Though we had hoped for the total obliteration of the Union of Britain and the end to Syndicalist influence in Europe, alas it was not to be. Instead the British wisely decided to make terms with us, signing the treaty in sight of a full German military parade. With this the bulk of the fighting is now over, and the Second Weltkrieg virtually ended in Europe."
gerfor.34.a:0 "Peace at last!"

gerfor.35.t:0 "The British Refused Peace!"
gerfor.35.d:0 "In a staggering display of British stubbornness, the Syndicalist wretches flatly denied our calls for a peace treaty. Instead of swallowing their pride and accepting the inevitable, the Republican government said that they would not have a Second Peace With Honour, and would end the war by marching through Berlin."
gerfor.35.a:0 "They will pay for this insolence."

gerfor.36.t:0 "Ethnic Conflict on Sri Lanka"
gerfor.36.d:0 "Ceylon Island is settled by Sinhalese and Tamils, who have battled for supremacy on the island for ages. With Black Monday wreaking havoc on our economy and colonial administration, disobedience from the native population is becoming intolerable. Our presence on Ceylon, crucial for its supplies of rubber, is becoming increasingly precarious."
gerfor.36.a:0 "Damn those nationalists!"

gerfor.37.t:0 "Union of Britain Invades Norway"
gerfor.37.d:0 "The Union of Britain has made the bold move of declaring war on the Norwegians, seeking to impose Syndicalism on them by force of arms. This invasion shows scant regard for German supremacy in Europe and the status quo that we have spent years maintaining. The question now is, what should our response to be this act of barbarism by the British?"

gerfor.38.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Norway"
gerfor.38.d:0 "We have received a damning telegram from the Reich. They are demanding that either we cease our invasion of Norway or face the full might of the Kaiserliche Marine. They cite the inviolability of sovereign European nations and a whole lot of guff about guarding the balance, but everyone knows that this act stems from German's desperate attempts to hold onto their hegemonic status on the continent. What should our response be?"

gerfor.39.t:0 "Germany Warns the Union of Britain over Norway"
gerfor.39.d:0 "Germany has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain, either fall back to their home islands or risk annihilation."

gerfor.40.t:0 "The Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.40.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or France."

gerfor.41.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Norwegian Ultimatum"
gerfor.41.d:0 "In a display of repugnant audacity, the Union of Britain ignored our ultimatum. North Sea operations do not seem to have altered at all and the Republicans are continuing the war against Norway. We cannot risk the red tide of Syndicalism sinking its tendrils into yet another nation, particularly one important to our strategic interests. At the same time, open war with London would distract us at an inopportune time and potentially lead to the Internationale joining in."

gerfor.42.t:0 "The British Withdraw from Norway"
gerfor.42.d:0 "The Union of Britain appears to have listened to wise counsel, and ceased their operations in the North Sea. The German ultimatum appears to have scared them off, and Syndicalism stopped from claiming yet another scalp."

gerfor.43.t:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
gerfor.43.d:0 "With the Syndicalists awakening all over the world it is crucial for the Reichspakt to help potential allies whenever possible. With Irish sympathies swayed towards Germany due to our support during the War of Independence there now exists the possibility of gaining a strong foothold just under the socialists' noses by getting Ireland into the Reichspakt. We should start by offering them equipment and construction support."
gerfor.43.a:0 "Offer Ireland aid if they join the Reichspakt."

gerfor.44.t:0 "German Offers Support"
gerfor.44.d:0 "The German ambassador has approached us with an offer: if Ireland signs a treaty of association with the Reichspakt Germany will invest in our economy and military. While the benefits from this deal would be immense there are some in the government who are unwilling to rely on foreign aid."
gerfor.44.a:0 "Where do I sign?"
gerfor.44.b:0 "We are doing fine on our own."

gerfor.45.t:0 "Ireland Signs the Treaty"
gerfor.45.d:0 "The Irish have agreed to our offer. According to the treaty we are to supply industrial machines and the licences required to construct additional ones in Ireland itself. Additionally, we are obliged to construct and deliver guns, artillery pieces, and a number of aircraft and armour pieces to bolster their armed forces."
gerfor.45.a:0 "Begin the construction then!"

gerfor.46.t:0 "Ireland Refuses the Treaty"
gerfor.46.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Irish have decided to turn our offer down. Still, our obligations towards Ireland remain the same as they were before."
gerfor.46.a:0 "Oh well."

gerfor.47.t:0 "Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.47.d:0 "We have finally finished preparations of all of the material ordered by the Irish as part of our treaty obligations. The goods are now ready to be delivered and we will give the convoy a military escort all the way to the Ireland."
gerfor.47.a:0 "Get it to Dublin, posthaste."

gerfor.48.t:0 "German Aid Arrives"
gerfor.48.d:0 "The guns, armour, aircraft and industrial machinery that Germany promised us as part of their treaty obligations have finally arrived. We have received a squadron each of fighters and bombers, a number of tanks as well as many artillery pieces and new German machine guns. This could be the first step in a fruitful relationship."
gerfor.48.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.49.t:0 "Our Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.49.d:0 "Unfortunately, with Ireland no longer able or willing to receive our aid the whole programme had to be aborted. Luckily, the equipment and craft already produced remain in our hands and is ready to be used."
gerfor.49.a:0 "Better than nothing."

gerfor.50.t:0 "Peace with [ENG.GetNameDef]?"
gerfor.50.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has negotiated a Second Peace with Honour with [ENG.GetNameDef], since it's clear the [ENG.GetAdjective] have lost their will to carry on the war. This might be a chance for us to end our war with them, as well. Should we take advantage of the opportunity, or continue the battle?"
gerfor.50.a:0 "Let's end this now"

gerfor.51.t:0 "Germany Requests Austrian Support"
gerfor.51.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, Germany treated us rather shabbily when it came to the Brest-Litovsk divisions, with Poland and Ukraine being forced from our sphere of influence by the glory-hogging Reich. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.51.a:0 "The Kaisers will fight together again!"

Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, with the end of the Weltkrieg the Germans refused to assist us in our recovery despite fighting with them virtually unnecessarily, and instead the Reich continued to exploit our serious foreign debt problems. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.52.a:0 "The Sultan shall aid the Reich!"

gerfor.53.t:0 "Germany Requests Bulgarian Support"
gerfor.53.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, despite our contributions to the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg being recognised to an extent, Germany seized control of Romania's coveted oil supplies for itself and has neglected us ever since. The question now is whether we should assist the Reich?"
gerfor.53.a:0 "We owe them. It is time to repay the debt!"
gerfor.53.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."

gerfor.58.d:0 "Despite all of our exhortations the Sultan refused to support us at all in our fight against the Internationale."
gerfor.58.a:0 "Damn him!"

gerfor.59.t:0 "Bulgaria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.59.d:0 "The Bulgarians ignored our call for support and instead decided to stay out of the crusade against the Syndicalists. It is not like a Balkan country to avoid a fight."

gerfor.60.t:0 "Austria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.60.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help but decided not to join our alliance or begin military operations against the Internationale. Instead they will send supplies and volunteers to help in our struggle against Syndicalism!"

gerfor.61.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Promises Some Support"
gerfor.61.d:0 "Though the Sultan was sympathetic to our cause, he made it clear that he did not wish to drag his realm into a needless war with the Internationale. Instead he promised to give us material support and to send volunteers."
gerfor.61.a:0 "The irony is palpable."

gerfor.62.t:0 "Bulgaria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.62.d:0 "The Bulgarian government did not wish to offer us overt military support, believing that though Syndicalism is a terrible plague, war with the Communards would be pointless. They promised to at least give us some equipment and volunteers."

The Norwegian inhabitants would be allowed to stay, as would our civilian administration, and the boost to commerce in the region would be immense. However, the Syndicalists might decide to retaliate against us if we agree to the offer...\n\nWhat shall we do?"

gerfor.65.t:0 "Norway Will Not Lease Trondheim"

gerfor.66.t:0 "Deal with the Devil?"
gerfor.66.d:0 "We have been defeated by the Syndicalist bastards but the Entente still fights on. While it was the inability of their governments to hold on to their lands that led to this whole mess in the first place, many say that we should put aside our differences and join with the Entente to reclaim our homeland."

gerfor.66.b:0 "We do not need them!"

gerfor.67.t:0 "Germany Seeks to Join the Entente"
gerfor.67.d:0 "The Germans have been defeated by the Syndicalist usurpers. While it was their fault that the Syndicalists have taken control of Europe they are now in the same position as we were just a few years ago.

Although the people are exhausted from years of war, there still remains a strong pro-German sentiment amongst the ruling class and a desire to stand side by side with the victors of the new order.\n\nNonetheless our empire does not intend to sell its skin cheaply and has demanded that the Caucasus, traditionally part of the Ottoman sphere, be restored to its control and that Azerbaijan becomes more tightly connected to the Sublime Porte. Although angered by our demands, it nonetheless seems like the German government is willing to consider the cost if it leads to the strengthening of their Southern Flank."

However, we are not alone on this newly-secured continent, for our old allies and bickering brother to the South in Vienna have managed to survive as well, and now we must decide on what to do with them. \n\nAlthough we were allies in the Great War, we have since fallen out of favor with one another despite our occasional cooperation, but many still call for our unification like it was the time of the Kleindeutschlanders and Großdeutschlanders all over again, and perhaps there is some stock in their desires. Put on the shelf as it became clear that another world war was beginning to rear its ugly head once more, the ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit plan would have the Kaisers in Vienna and Berlin come together to meet as equals in order to discuss the future of Europe and the Pan-European and Pan-German questions once and for all.

Delighting many Pan-European theorists throughout the Empire like Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi and Milan Hodža, as well as many Pan-Germans like Karl Hermann Wolf and George Ritter von Schönerer, and the German Bohemians under Konrad Henlein, to name a few, this idea of a ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit could be promising, but could also spell the end of Austrian independence as well as we potentially unify with Berlin. What shall we do?"

With our southern brothers turning their back on us once again, we are left with two options. We can either turn our backs as well and walk towards our own future alone, or we could prepare for war once more in order to settle the German Question once and for all - what shall we do?"

gerfor.203.d:0 "With Austria agreeing to our call for a summit between the Kaisers, we have been hard at work these past few weeks preparing for the meeting, and finally the long-awaited day has finally arrived. Deep within the vaulted, ornately decorated halls of the Königliches Schloss on Spree Island in the heart of Berlin, on grounds guarded by more soldiers loyal to either Kaiser than any one person would normally see off the battlefield, the Kaiser Summit was held at long last. What was said behind those closed doors will likely never be truly known, but the outcome of which will reverberate through time immemorial regardless of the outcome as the future of an entire continent, and the entire Western World along with it, hangs in the balance. As the Kaiser in Berlin tried to convince the Kaiser in Austria to be a secondary monarch among many within a unified Pan-European system under the German crown, or perhaps a dual crown shared equally by both monarchs, the Austrian Kaiser nearly left multiple times, but yet the summit lasted, at least for awhile, as two of the most powerful men on the face of planet hashed it out for the good of Europe. With the Summit going on for hours at first that soon turned into days, a final decision needed to be made soon, and so what shall be the outcome of the Kaisergipfel as the fate of the continent hangs in the balance?"

Though the first phase focused on our relationship with our southern Catholic brothers, the second phase deals with the rest of the continent at large as we shift our focus from a Pan-Germanic direction towards the realization of the Pan-European idyll. Should the Kaiserreich continue to exert its influence beyond the Germanic lands of Central Europe, across the cradle of Western Civilization until all of Europe from Iberia to the Urals is united so that we can build our unified, syncretic culture that truly is the height of human perfection on the face of the earth, and if so how should we approach this noble goal, or should we ignore these misplace and naive fantasies in order to focus on building our Pan-Germanic paradise while strengthening the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa without advancing them to their natural Pan-European conclusions?"

Seeking to further Germanic settlement across the scattered lands of the Kaiserreich while simultaneously drawing our colonies and puppets closer to Berlin to the point of inseparability, these internationalists - calling themselves imperial globalists and other similar terms to distinguish themselves from the foul Trotskyite menace that is Leftist Internationalism - push for the total national unification of the entire German Empire, and have gone to great lengths to convince the Kaiser and His Highness’ government of the merits of their ambition.

Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed into a celebration of the Reich's foundation, and after the Weltkrieg the humbling of its foes.\n\nIn every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobles, soldiers and innumerable veterans parade proudly through the streets, cheered by the happy masses. Indeed, this is a good day, a day that reminds us of the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed since the forging of the Reich."

gerfla.6.d:0 "Even after his death was reported early this morning, Erich von Ludendorff remains one of the most controversial people in recent German history. On the one hand he was a hero of the Weltkrieg, the orchestrator of German victory in the 1919 fall of France. On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten the ensuing military dictatorship that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924. Although Ludendorff still received some honours for his service, like his knighthood, the former quartermaster-general mostly led a secluded life at his estate afterwards."

gerfla.9.d:0 "The Propylӓen Verlag subdivision of the Ullstein Verlag publishing house has announced its intention to release a new series of books devoted to individual German soldiers' stories, accounts,and poetry from the conflicts of the Weltkrieg, titled 'Unser Kampf' or ‘Our Struggle’. Notable examples include the diaries of famous figures such as Ernst Jünger and Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, as well as the memoirs of lesser personas, such as that of corporal Adolf Hitler - a signalman who amongst other distinctions was awarded no less than two Iron Crosses for his valor on both the Western and Eastern fronts before tragically being slain in 1918 at the hands of British soldier Henry Tandey. The diaries provide a unique and fiery insight into the nature of a bitter ideological struggle while honoring fallen heroes and showcasing the tragic heroism and horrors that war truly brings in a personal and intimate portrayal straight from the front. What better way to reaffirm the values and continuing glory of the Kaiserreich while also shining light on the grim realities of world war in these troubled times?"

'Unser Kampf' boasts the highest production values hitherto seen - made possible by state investments into the Babelsberg studios - and offers a frighteningly real and morbid, although simultaneously glorified, depiction of the war. Starring Heinz Ruhmann, Hans Albers, Theodor Loos, and Marlene Dietrich, among others, the story focuses on the heroism and dedication of the 'small people' in the Weltkrieg, such as young fighter aces like Heinrich Gontermann, Hans-Joachim Buddecke, Max Immelmann, Oswald Boelcke, and Adolf Ritter von Tutschek that tragically died in the line of duty or people like the valiant corporal and signalman Adolf Hitler - being played by his own living nephew William Patrick Hitler; together who all sacrificed everything for their Kaiser and the Reich in the mud of Marcoing and other battlefields across Europe and the wider globe. May this film and others like it, such as the soon to be released ‘Metropolis’ and the previously-released ‘SOS Eisberg’ and ‘Das Blaue Licht’ continue to progress contemporary German cinema and art."

As part of the FVP's new Mitteleuropa immigration program, the majority of people aboard the vessel were skilled laborers, possessing skills that they had acquired over a very long career. While there is no shortage of skilled labor in the Kaiserreich, there is optimism that this cultural and laboral diffusion will lead to closer relations between our two states. Their arrival was unremarkable, with the delegation quickly being interrupted by a minor group of conservatives, displeased with the arrival of Irish Catholics. However, we are confident that the Bavarians in our delegation helped our guests to disregard the outburst and feel more welcome in their new home, due to their shared Catholic heritage."

Upon further investigation, the throngs of German press determined the two mysterious figures were none other than Vorbeck's nephew Hans Albert, an up-and-coming officer in the Mittelafrikan army, as well as Nordrhodesien general Julian Scherner, a longtime confidant of the Chancellor's. This was confirmed later in the day when Vorbeck officially named them as generals in the Imperial German Army. While some political pundits are accusing Paul of nepotism for promoting his nephew, it's no secret that both men were inspired by the renewed patriotism of Lettow-Vorbeck's Germany and both want to take the fight directly to the despicable Communards."

Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to send a few models to the major colonies and constituent members of the Reichspakt, allowing our armies and the armies of our subjects to utilize this unique technology. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, rotabuggies, and other novel transports devised by crack German scientists and our allied lackeys, we shall be able to ferry our populace, our goods, and our troops all around the Kaiserreich without issue or delay while also delivering devastating payloads at a moment’s notice. Just be careful not to crash any, for we only have a fragile few, and they are currently very temperamental and very hard to replace."

gerfla.18.d:0 "Seeking to put their recent technological breakthroughs to the test, Berlin has been gracious enough to send some of their new military hardware to be tested on the frontlines here at the fringes of Germany’s sphere. The centerpiece invention of these new shipments are the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, or Dragon. These ‘Dragons’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these ‘Dragons’ have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Germans sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of the Kaiserirech and the wider Reichspakt."

gerfla.19.d:0 "Founded by Berlin-born artist Walter Gropius in the years following our victory in the Great War, the Staatliches Bauhaus is one of the Kaiserreich’s most famous, or infamous, art schools that first opened its doors in 1919 after working within the Deutscher Werkbund art union founded by Hermann Muthesius in 1907. Aimed at the creation of a Gesamtkunstwerk, or a comprehensive artwork in which all the different mediums of art in all its forms would be brought together in order to feed each other in a new, comprehensive artistic revolution based on non-Leftist Internationalism, anti-Expressionism, New Objectivity/New Sobriety (called Neues Bauen or Neue Saclichkeit in German), and new concepts of liberal German Modernism and the avant-garde. With three campuses now existing in Berlin, Dessau, and Weimar as the movement explodes in popularity, the Bauhaus group has largely been dominated by rival architect-directors Walter Gropius, Hannes Meyer, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, along with famous artists like Paul Klee, Wassily Kandisnky, László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Schlemmer, Ernst May, Martin Wagner, Bruno Taut, Bruno Paul, Erich Mendelsohn, Hans Poelzig, Adolf Meyer, Peter Behrens, Joost Schmidt, and more, all dedicated to the creation of rational, functional, and non-fanciful art that flies in the face of the baroque, imposing classic architecture traditional throughout the Kaiserreich and the rising Völkisch movements that resist the march of progress. \n\nDespite their growing popularity, and their sole focus on art and nothing else like their famous new fonts and futurist art dedicate to the adaptation of German architecture towards something that fits ‘our world of machines, radios, and fast cars’, the Bauhaus group have been accused of harboring radically liberal or Leftist sentiments, holding traitorous ties to the Russian constructivist Vkhutemas art school, and harboring anti-monarchist sentiments, though none of these claims have been verified, likely just being hearsay spread by Bauhaus’ detractors. Regardless, this has not stopped many reactionary groups from going after the Left-ish artist guild while supporting rival art movements and typefaces like the dated Fraktur style and its rivalry with the Antiqua and Textura movements, or more modern attempts at a medieval-esque styles like Fraktur's proposed replacements of Kurrentschrift or Sütterlin, forcing our administration’s hand and leaving the decision of what to do with these artists up to the Crown. So what shall we do?"

gerfla.20.d:0 "Friedrich August Georg Ferdinand Albert Karl Anton Paul Marcellus, or simply King Georg of Saxony, has managed to seize the headlines in German newspapers despite the crisis previously possessing a monopoly on the front page: Georg has abdicated his throne in favor of a life in the Catholic Church, specifically in the Jesuit Order.\n\nRuling as the King of Saxony since his father's death in 1932, Georg had shockingly been thinking over the concept of abdication for years as the intrigues of noble life in the German Empire had been "intellectually limiting", all this exacerbated by what he viewed as his inability to truly help others across the Empire during the ongoing economic crisis and the increasing radicalism of both left and right. As his personal noblesse oblige led him to serving on the front in the Weltkrieg, even being wounded for it, so it again seemed to push him towards a life of theological work among the people he once represented as a king, believing that public religious teachings can help direct the population away from radicalism.\n\nHe has made it apparent he wishes to offer religious guidance and a spirited promotion of ecumenism, desiring a perspective of cooperativeness towards Protestant elements across the fatherland. The former king is well within his rights to abdicate, but as openly altruistic as his motivations are there remained some controversy in the halls of power. Notably, various Prussian nobles have voiced a concern over a German monarch holding such large swaths of foreign territory, permitted to operate an "exterior fiefdom" outside of the Empire's direct control, granting a possible manipulator far too much power than he should wield.\n\nFor now these "issues of state stability" are remaining only in the mouths of squawking old priests and noblemen, leaving Georg's abdication to be seen as most as the pinnacle of a nobleman's duty, but their paranoid proclamations have reopened a few questions on the status of Poland in the Reichspakt and the status quo of Prussianism in the eyes of the cunning few..."

gerfla.24.d:0 "Ever since US Congress designated the second Sunday of May as Mother's Day in 1914, as a sign of love and reverence for the mothers of the world, this American tradition has slowly gained traction across the Atlantic. After the end of the Weltkrieg, the Association of German Flower Shop Owners (Verband Deutscher Blumengeschäftsinhaber) took advantage of this as a marketing tactic, promoting the date to raise flower sales in May. The liturgical emphasis of the original vision of the holiday also earned the support of religious conservative groups, who considered it a viable alternative to International Women's Day, initiated by socialist organisations. Movements calling for making it an official holiday earned traction in the German Empire in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nAlongside business owners, conservative societies, and women's rights activists, the campaign in Germany was also endorsed by völkisch groups, who connected the idea of Mother's Day with their far-right ideal of a loyal childbearing mother who is the future of the Germanic master race. All of this has coalesced into an ongoing question as to whether or not Mother's Day should be made an official holiday in the Kaiserreich. The Empire has... seen better days, but perhaps a small propaganda victory will cause no harm?"

gerfla.27.d:0 "In the newest publication of \"Chemiker-Zeitung über die wichtigsten Gebiete der Chemie und chemischen Industrie\", readers could find an article submitted by Hans Krebs M.D., entitled \"The Role of Citric Acid in Intermediate Metabolism in Animal Tissues\". In it, Krebs presented his newest discovery of a cycle of reactions involving the molecule citric acid, that has proven to be essential in the functioning of all living organisms. The process involves a series of cyclical chemical conversions, and is a vital element of cellular respiration, allowing all organisms to function.\n\nThe author of the paper, Dr. Hans Krebs, is a researcher at the University of Freiburg, known for discovering the Ornithine Cycle in 1932. Using previous work by Albert Imre Szent-Györgyi de Nagyrápolt, who discovered several products and reactions in the cycle, Krebs has presented his discoveries in a succinct fashion.\n\nThis recent discovery has been seen as extremely innovative, and Krebs is already receiving further honours and renown in the scientific world. The achievement has also bolstered the reputation of German scientific circles, and more importantly, the Kaiser-Wilhelm Society."

gerfla.28.d:0 "The nominations for the 1940 Nobel Prize in Literature are already reaching the Nobel Prize Committee, and among them is an unexpected name — Wilhelm Storost, more commonly known by the name \"Vydūnas\".\n\nVydūnas is a spiritual leader of the Prussian-Lithuanian community, a member of Theosophist societies, a poet and philosopher, as well as a noted preserver of local traditions, folklore, songs and even their ancient pre-Christian faith, which he has sought to rebuild and redeem. His moral influence among the shrinking Lithuanian-speaking population in East Prussia is unquestioned, and he has even made a name for himself on the other side of the Memelland, in the Kingdom of Lithuania, where his works are read and cited. Of course, he has garnered respect among German intellectuals as well, although his minority status and focus leaves him relatively unknown.\n\nStill, the news were met warmly in Berlin and with joy in Tilsit, and though his victory is not assured at all, merely taking Vydūnas into consideration is a significant accomplishment for the Prussian-Lithuanians. The only point of tension is the possible clash between him and the aristocratic Prussian establishment - a considerable portion of Vydūnas' works is dedicated to the conquest and colonisation of Prussia by the Teutonic Knights, and the destruction of local culture and way of life that this process caused. As not only Prussia, but arguably the Empire itself originates from the territories gained in the Ostsiedlung, this has gotten right-wing press to deride the poet as unpatriotic."

gerfla.34.d:0 "Aleksander Majkòwsczi — a leading figure in Towarzëstwò Młodokaszëbów (Young Kashubians Association) — has been working to release his project \"The History of Kashubia\" in snippets for the \"Gryf\" newspaper since 1922, and in book form since 1936, in reaction to \"Geschichte der Kaschuben\" by Friedrich Lorentz. As Lorentz's book was perceived as a history of Germanisation in Kashubia, Majkòwsczi decided to highlight Kashubian nationality as Slavic by beginning his book with a short history of Slavic Nationalities. He perceived that Western Slavs, including Pomeranians and Kashubians, were influenced by Western Europe — with German as its main influence, strengthened by Germanisation. It was followed by a geographical overview of Kashubia, its local groups, and the historians of the nation. Later the book presented history from legends: through pagan culture, Polish Rule, the Duchy of Pomerelia under the local Sobiesławice dynasty, Teutonic Rule, renewed Polish Administration and finally Prussian Rule which lasts to present day.\n\nAleksander Majkòwsczi didn't live long enough to see his book published as he passed away earlier this year when it was being printed. A committee was formed, made up of his former colleagues, who decided to publish the book in his name alongside his novel \"Żëcé i przigòdë Remùsa\". Since release, the book was met with harsh criticism from the German Right, who call for banning the book, but has been lauded by Kashubian and liberal politicians."

gerfla.35.d:0 "Prussia is a large realm and rules over many territories whose population is not too fond of their East Elbian overlords. While these opponents of Prussian rule can mostly be found in the distant periphery of the Empire, some of the most ardent regional patriots in fact do not live too far away from the capital — the Lower Saxons, who inhabit the Prussian Province of Hanover, the Duchy of Brunswick, the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe and the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg. While similar to the Prussians in faith and dialect, they have a strong regional identity that reaches back thousands of years, and the Hanoverians have a deep disdain for the Prussians due to the annexation of their kingdom back in '66, manifested among others in the existence of the Guelph Party (DHP), whose main aim is the restoration of a sovereign Kingdom of Hanover within the Empire.\n\nLower Saxon patriotism however is not confined to the DHP, and this is shown most prominently in the Lower Saxon Homeland League. The oldest German regionalist movement, it evokes an even older image of the flat and marshy territories between Elbe and Ems, celebrating the medieval spirit of the Saxon Kingdom that bravely asserted itself against Romans, Franks and Staufers, and embraces illustrious leaders such as Arminius, Duke Widukind and Henry the Lion, famous scientists like Leibniz and Gauß, and acclaimed writers such as Hermann Löns, Wilhelm Busch and Hoffmann von Fallersleben.\n\nHowever, though local patriotism in the far northwest is strong, it never was enough to actively resist Prussian rule, as petty rivalries have plagued the Lower Saxon movement for decades. The official \"Song of the Lower Saxons\" does not even include the lands west of the Weser. A protestant Harzer does not have much in common with a catholic Emslander, and the Oldenburgers are so proud of their Grand Duchy that they keep a certain distance to their \"brethren\" on the other side of the border. Annually, the Homeland League convenes the so-called \"Lower Saxon Day\" to foster local identity and celebrate their \"common\" history, but one thing is certain - as long as the Prussians control most of the region, the Lower Saxons will remain a spiritually divided people."

gerfla.44.d:0 "Ongoing land reclamation around Helgoland and Düne has been progressing well, with many famed noble houses invited to enjoy the local amenities during brief pauses in the project. Düne's newest addition, a beautiful Wilhelmine manor funded by a prestigious Prussian dynasty, has furthered upper society interest. However, a recent string of grisly events has stained the island in a way that even our construction workers are threatening to leave for the mainland.\n\nDuring a storm that cut Düne off for several days, unfortunately when our entire workforce was absent, the aforementioned dynasty had been holding a conference to discuss their assets and further investment into Helgoland. As the isle has no permanent inhabitants, the family and their servants were the only ones there. At some point during the two day storm, a blood-soaked massacre must have unfolded, as investigators that later came to the estate had found none of the nobility nor their entourage were still alive. Alongside this bewildering slaughter we have also uncovered a grand conspiracy, as the family's patriarch was rumored to have hidden his secret cache of gold on Düne for safekeeping. Eyewitnesses, be they survivors or the perpetrator, are yet to be identified. Thus, any semblance of justice for the murdered eighteen seems like a distant hope. Regardless, many are quick to think the motive of this illusive killer was simple greed.\n\nThe police are convinced that no one could have possibly come onto the island before the family did nor while the storm was ongoing, and so all are left scratching their heads looking for possible leads. The investigation has been hampered by seemingly contradictory pieces of evidence and "impossibilities" in what must have transpired. Even now, a proper timeline of events has yet to be constructed. Wild claims of the hidden gold has brought much of the police force tasked with solving the mystery into self-serving searches, and many of our lead detectives are growing pessimistic that any true resolution can be obtained.\n\nThe murders have sparked superstitious talk of ghosts, spirits, and even a witch roaming near the cliffs, that has put a pause on our expansion of the archipelago. Foremen who have succumbed to the same hysterics as their workers have been fired, and their replacements are going through the slow process of setting everything back in order. Even after the sitution is resolved, no matter the conclusion of the investigation, a grim mistery is bound to hang over Helgoland for years."

Included in the sealed text is a supposed retelling of the mass murders with elaborate descriptions of esoteric occurrences and inexplicable ways in which the crime was committed. Ultimately, the message professes that a "witch", bearing the likeness of a portrait in the family's manor, is the true culprit.\n\nInitially this occult reconstruction of the incident was laughed off in the local press and never reached national news, but a subsequent announcement from the police caused this enchanted explanation to take the country by storm. State detectives, aching after a year of little progress and sensing hope in independent sleuths, declared that they found a similar manuscript during the initial investigation. This second message details a completely different sequence of fantastical events, but still condemns a "witch" as the murderer.\n\nMany among the Empire's nobility are decrying the messages as "baseless detective fiction" that takes advantage of a terrible tragedy, but this has not stopped a seemingly endless amount of theories and conspiracies from being produced. Intellectuals, workers, and even some politicians have tried to solve the riddle of this peculiar crime; with the search for the culprit becoming something of a national competition as the months go by."

gerfla.200.d:0 "The pursuit of technological progress waits for no man, and with war in the air, innovation is as common as the anticipation and emotion that drives it, driving the Kaiserreich, and more specifically our military industry, into overdrive. One such recent benefit from this inspirational flash, though also aided by the Kaiser’s fascination with having his dreamed large navy be realized among the heavens, is the revitalization of the rigid airship program. First started by Graf Ferdinand von Zeppelin and his ‘Luftschiffbau Zeppelin’ company, the German obsession with dirigibles has only grown deeper. Since the Great War ended, the need for militarized zeppelins dropped to a secondary concern as focus was shifted to DELAG - the world’s first commercial airline - in order to cash in on the post-war economic boom. Initially centered around zeppelin airports in Berlin and Friedrichshafen, DELAG has since set up new hubs in cities all across not just Germany but the wider Kaiserreich and Reichspakt at large in an attempt to connect the world for the good of good of Germany and humanity through globalism, and the not-so subtle spread of German soft power. However, with war once again looming on the horizon, we must ready the airfleet for conflict once again. \n\nAlthough the DELAG service shall continue to run unhindered, funds from other areas shall be diverted to the expansion and conversion of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin’s manufacturing capabilities so that we can expand our military airfleet of zeppelins before it is too late, for building them and sourcing the helium needed for them from our trade partners in America, North Africa, and Eastern Europe shall take some time. Until new models can be developed, we shall largely be producing the Hindenburg-class - the largest of its kind currently in existence, for now - with the aging Graf Zeppelin II airship serving as the command ship of the airfleet. Using tactics perfected by zeppelin commanders like Peter Strasser and Hugo Eckener guiding us and our new air crews that are entering training, we shall build the greatest air force the world has ever seen!"

Capable of not only high-altitude bombing missions, recon/supply runs, and cruise line service as current zeppelins are as well, these new super zeppelins are also capable of minor modularization, allowing them to be re-outfitted and re-configured to fit a variety of other combat roles as needed, such as running close-air support or tackling naval targets. With these great flying beasts of war, we have become like the Valkyries themselves, riding forth on mighty winged steeds ready to bring righteous ruination and justice to our foes, so let us do this great Germanic legacy proud by using these new wonder weapons to the best of our ability and their immense potential."

Whatever the case may be, we have these marvels of air travel and warfare now at our disposal, with many within our administration eager to set up air travel services with the rest of the empire by tapping into Germany’s DELAG - the first airline in the world. Utilizing strategies, tactics, plans, and operating manuals penned by Germany’s brightest zeppelin commanders like Hugo Eckener and Peter Strasser along with their complementary training liaison, we shall also focus on military matters, fast tracking new air crews to let us use these new wonders of modern technology to their maximum potential in both commercial and militaristic endeavors.

Seeking to emulate the success of Germany’s DELAG service - the first airline in the world - in order to better connect our nation both to itself and the outside world, while also seeking to surpass the awe-inspiring terror and destruction wrought by the bomb bays of German zeppelins during the Great War, we shall begin limited production of these floating behemoths, so long as we can source the gasses - hopefully helium - needed to give them lift, for only a fool would resort to something more flammable like hydrogen...right?"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Wilhelm II von Hohenzollern, the 'Father of the Reichspakt', has ruled the German Empire for nearly 50 years. His reign has seen the rise of Germany to status of foremost world power, and is considered to have brought on the 'German Golden Age.' Since the Weltkrieg, Germany has eclipsed its rivals, and its drive to acquire a place in the sun has been fulfilled. Even if dark clouds loom over the horizon, Kaiser Wilhelm has the support of his people, his military, and the aristocracy which lord over both."
POLITICS_WILLY_3_DESC:0 "Emperor Wilhelm III, despite lackluster performance as commander of Germany's Army Group B during the Weltkrieg, was hailed as a hero upon his return home. With the death of his father, Wilhelm the war hero, was enthroned as the new Emperor of Germany. Wilhelm is a friend and ally of Kurt von Schleicher, and affirms the importance of the aristocracy in governance."

POLITICS_GERD_VON_RUNDSTEDT_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 12th, 1875, in Aschersleben, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn to a dynasty of Prussian nobility whose men all served in the military since Frederick the Great, Gerd von Rundstedt did not stray from this tradition - his path since maturity strayed little from the ordinary Prussian noble officer, first the Kadettenanstalt Oranienstein, then Royal Prussian Main Cadet Institute at Groß-Lichterfelde, in Berlin. Commissioned as an infantry officer, he made a good impression on his superiors for outstanding ability and so began to climb the ranks. At the beginning of the Weltkrieg, he was the 22nd Division's Chief of Staff - throughout the course of the war, he saw little action, mostly serving in various staff positions, but with a high reputation among his peers.\n\nAfter the war, he used this good impression and connections to climb the ranks again, ultimately reaching the rank of Generaloberst. A competent and experienced commander respected by pretty much everyone in the General Staff, von Rundstedt is also perhaps the most apolitical - no matter what the topic or issue may be, his view is that the Army must stay out of any political affairs. After all, Prussian field marshals never mutiny."
POLITICS_RUPPRECHT_VON_BAYERN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 18th, 1869, in Munich, Kingdom of Bavaria\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe incumbent King of Bavaria, Rupprecht Maria Luitpold Ferdinand, is also one of the most decorated commanders of the Imperial German Army during the Weltkrieg. Trained as an infantry officer in the Bavarian Army, he eventually rose to command the Bavarian I Army Corps, all while travelling extensively, taking up on carpentry, and fulfilling his duties as a prince of the Bavarian royal family. In 1913, he became the heir apparent of the Kingdom, and a year later, he was assigned to lead the German Sixth Army during the Schlieffen Plan. Though his assignment was made due to his royal status, he proved to be an able and innovative commander. At the same time, however, he used his military command to push for Bavarian interests - refusing to withdraw his army from the Western Front to defend Prussia and thus forcing the General Staff to move troops from Belgium instead.\n\nIn July 1916, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and was assigned to command the Army Group Rupprecht, a rank he has held onto until today. In 1921, after the passing of his father, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Rupprecht was crowned as the new King of Bavaria, and reigns as a constitutional monarch with respect for the laws and institutions of his homeland. Though having to occupy two chairs at once may seem exhausting for some, the King seems none worse for wear, and dutifully awaits Germany's next great war."
POLITICS_AUGUST_VON_MACKENSEN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nDecember 6th, 1849, in Leipnitz, Province of Saxony, Kingdom of Prussia\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe oldest general in the Imperial German Army, known as 'the Last Hussar', August Mackensen came from a middle class upbringing in rural Prussia. His father, an agricultural administrator, hoped for his son to follow the same career path, but he instead volunteered for the Prussian army and served with distinction in the Franco-Prussian War. In the years following the war, Mackensen broke expectations one after the other, bypassing the three-year preparation period for the General Staff and later serving as an adjutant to Wilhelm II himself, the first commoner to do so. On the Kaiser's 40th birthday, he was ennobled, becoming August von Mackensen, and was assigned to command XVII Army Corps - a prestigious position, as Crown Prince Wilhelm now served under him.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he was one of Germany's most successful and prestigious commanders, assigned to front after front in Europe - Galicia, Serbia, and finally Romania, shattering Entente resistance in all three campaigns. He returned to Germany a war hero and a Generalfeldmarschall, and continued to serve in in the Army hereforth. By now, however, von Mackensen is over eighty years old, his sharpness has dulled and his body is no longer as able as it once was - most assume a retirement is coming soon, the only thing that matters is when."
POLITICS_WILHELM_III_GENERAL_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 6th, 1882, in Marmorpalais, Potsdam, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nThe heir apparent of the German Empire since the age of six, Crown Prince Wilhelm is a decorated commander in the Imperial German Army on his own right. A modern royal well-liked within German society, a competent equestrian and a student of administrative law, he began his career in the army in 1911, commissioned to command the 1st Life Hussar Regiment. When the Weltkrieg began, he rose to command the 5th Army, and then the Army Group Kronprinz Wilhelm, despite his young age and lack of military experience. His influence in decision-making on the front was minimal, however, and Wilhelm instead used the prestige of his position to support Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff - he described the ousting of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as "the most beautiful day of his life".\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm returned from the Western Front a war hero, and continued his duties as the heir apparent. In the post-war years, he has retained his position in the Army, while growing increasingly close with the German right wing - especially Kurt von Schleicher, who is a friend and ally of Wilhelm's."

POLITICS_ERICH_VON_MANSTEIN_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nNovember 24th, 1887, in Marmorpalais, Potsdam, Kingdom of Prussia, German Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nBorn as von Lewinski, Erich von Manstein comes from the family of a noble Prussian general with Kashubian heritage, and is the nephew of Paul von Hindenburg. Much like the rest of his extended family, he followed a career in the military. After six years in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment - and reached the Weltkrieg as an infanrtry lieutenant enrolled in the Prussian War Academy. The war put an end to his studies and sent him to the front - both East and West, in several front and several world-renown campaigns, ending with the victorious march into France in 1919.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Manstein remained in the army and continued climbing the ranks, having shown his talent and intelligence in the years prior. As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, all while developing his own. Regarded as an innovative commander with a knack for unorthodox strategies, he is one of the main proponents of combined arms, mobile warfare in the German army."

GER_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Kommunistische Arbeiterpartei Deutschlands/Kommunistische Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands\n§gThe two organisations share as much history as they have their own history. The KAPD (Communist Workers' Party) was formed in April 1920 as a split from the KPD based upon tactical and political differences, with the most important one being the KAPD's strong council-communist bent, anti-parliamentarianism and their tactics of 'leadership by example', decried as adventurist by the KPD majority. The KAPD's primary ally is the KAUD, formed in 1931 as a merger of the anti-trade union organisation AAUD (Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union Deutschland, General Workers' Union of Germany) and the AAUD-E (Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union – Einheitsorganisation, General Workers' Union of Germany - Unitary Organisation). Both the KAPD and KAUD express their support for 'Unionen', unions that are formed based upon economic regions, not trades, unlike the traditional 'Gewerkschaften'. These 'Unionen' are made out of factory organisations (Betriebsorganisationen, BO). They also both support the formation of a unitary organisation for the proletariat, however most agree that this is not possible currently and thus are willing to maintain the KAPD as a 'necessary evil' (the AAUD-E demanded immediate unification and thus split from the AAUD in 1921, which however after becoming fully decimated re-unified with the AAUD). The organisations insist that the revolution is not a task of a party, but the task of the proletariat, seeing the KAPD's role as merely being a catalyst for their action, with the task of the KAUD being meanwhile to fight against the traditional trade unions and take control of the workplaces.§!

The SPD was regularly fought by the conservative establishment, with the two most important ones being the suppression of the SPD under Bismarck and later Ludendorff. Before the First World War, the SPD was the strongest party in the Reichstag. During the War, however, the SPD split in two; the moderate MSPD and the more radical anti-war USPD. After a failed peaceful revolution in September 1918, both parties once more reconciled and reunited under the banner of the SPD. The SPD was the most vocal opponent of the Ludendorff dictatorship and the target of many government-instructed sanctions.    SPD representatives were present at the dismissal of the dictator and many people within the Empire attribute the fall of the dictatorship to them. Under Germany’s "second-greatest" chancellor, Alfred von Tirpitz, the SPD also has had to struggle against increasing levels of wealth among workers leading to decreased electoral output even in former core territories. The SPD's voter block is mostly among the lower classes and the industrial areas along the Rhine in the Kingdom of Saxony and in cities in Silesia, but Elsaß-Lothringen is also proving to be a hotbed of German social democracy, especially after the decline of the Zentrum and the ongoing centralisation efforts of the government.§!"

Thanks to the FVP's strong support among liberal civil servants, the FVP managed to become the largest bourgeois opposition party after the 1923 elections – but wasn't able to capitalise on this success properly. The party lost many seats in the disastrous elections of 1928 and 1932, with many going to the SPD. The FVP is currently lead by its left-wing wing lead by Anton Erkelenz, being supportive of a number of socially liberal reforms, like voting rights for women, strong economic intervention, et cetera.§!"

The NLP was mainly powerless in the Reichstag during the Weltkrieg, though cooperating with the left-wing parties at times. When the DVLP was created, some thought the NLP would get usurped by them, but Stresemann was able to keep the NLP independent, with him leading the NLP to be neutral on the Ludendorff dictatorship.                    After Ludendorff's fall and the rise of Tirpitz, the NLP joined Tirpitz's great coalition, with it supporting German colonialism, expansion of the military, and liberal economic policies in the government. Stresemann was able to make the NLP flourish, thus his death in 1929 strongly weakened the NLP. Dingeldey led the NLP in its worst election result ever, causing his resignation, and him unable to give the NLP a position in the government. Dingeldey was replaced by Reichsbankpräsident Hjalmar Schacht as leader, with Julius Curtius being the chancellor candidate of the NLP. The NLP has strong support among industry giants and the more well-off, though some of them have been moving away from the NLP, looking for a new champion of their interests.§!"

The Zentrum was a main architect of the Reichstag’s Peace Resolution of 1917, under the guise of the leader of the parliamentary faction, Matthias Erzberger. The Zentrum was opposed to the Ludendorff dictatorships, though it refrained from supporting protests. The party tried to widen its appeal in 1923, however, this failed massively, causing the rise of the centrist Wilhelm Marx, but he too was unable to turn the fortunes of the party, with the Zentrum losing another election in 1932.                             With both the leftists and centrists within the party discredited, the right-wing under the leadership of Franz von Papen took over, pursuing a unitarian vision, which caused many defections from the party, with him also causing the left-wing of the party to jump ship and form the CSRP. The party is strongly aligned to the DkP, however there Heinrich Brüning is leading the opposition towards von Papen's leadership, wanting a return to the original federalist elements of the Zentrum, with him also wishing to reunite the Zentrum with its splinter parties. §!"

It opposed the democratic alliance of SPD, FVP, and Zentrum in the Reichstag together with the DkP during the First World War. The party was a silent supporter of the Ludendorff dictatorship, with it becoming the smallest member of the Great Coalition of von Tirpitz.

The DkP was initially a supporter of the Ludendorff dictatorship but turned against it in the 1920s.                               After the 1923 elections, the DkP under Ernst von Heydebrand und der Lasa and Kuno Graf von Westarp reluctantly joined the Great Coalition of von Tirpitz. After the 1928 elections, Kuno von Westarp, under the pressure of the growing DVLP began the process of modernising the DkP to also attract urban right-wing voters and reform into a conservative-tent party. With it even backing an expansion of social welfare, though it also is in favour of cutting spending, except for agricultural subsidies. After the surprising death of von Tirpitz in 1930, the Kaiser picked von Westarp as his successor. Following two years of uneventful rule, the German electorate voted to let von Westarp be the new administrator and keeper of its wealth. Kuno von Westarp has done as was demanded, and the last few years have been quiet, with as little change as possible.

When the Ludendorff dictatorship was removed, Alfred von Tirpitz was picked by Wilhelm as his successor, with him creating a Great Coalition of right-wing parties to solve the issues brought on by the Ludendorff dictatorship. This moderation of the party caused a lot of upset from the right-wing of the party, manifesting itself when they took over the party in the wake of the death of von Tirpitz.

GER_Mauser_werke_desc:0 "Founded under the auspices of the mighty Friedrich himself, Mauser has been instrumental in aiding the growth of German power over the past century. By sponsoring them more directly we can increase and improve our small arms production."

GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1:0 "Build More Airbases"
GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1_desc:0 "Build airbases both in the Heimat and outer provinces so that we can set the infrastructure for better defence and offence in the skies."

GER_Henschel_Albatros:0 "Naval Aviation Corps"
GER_Henschel_Albatros_desc:0 "Another result of the untangling of air warfare from ground warfare has been the founding of a group of aviators focused on naval aviation. These pilots, trained in special courses, are now demanding aircraft to fit their special requirements."

GER_Junkers_Fogger:0 "Long-Range Fighters"
GER_Junkers_Fogger_desc:0 "As a result of the Bombergruppen doctrine, the demands on range of operations has multiplied. Theorists and researchers are demanding new aircraft models to keep up with their increasingly aggressive bombardment plans. After the Paris bomber comes the London bomber, after that the Moscow bomber - and there doesn't seem to be an end!"

GER_mil_expansion_land_1:0 "Militarist Revival"
GER_mil_expansion_land_1_desc:0 "The German people are renowned for their bellicosity and national pride. The Weltkrieg, however, cost us dearly and many a family was denuded of its menfolk. It is time for us to revive the militaristic spirit of the Prussian era, in the name of the Reich and the Kaiser!"

GER_Infantry_divs:0 "New Weapons"
GER_Infantry_divs_desc:0 "While the German army has the greatest soldiers in the world, it must not lag behind in equipment terms. Even the greatest of soldiers will have a hard time defeating a better equipped enemy and it would not do for the pre-eminent world power to have troops armed with broomsticks."

GER_political_1:0 "Imperial Restructuring"
GER_political_1_desc:0 "While it is an undeniable fact that the German Empire is the greatest nation to ever grace the pages of history, there is always room for improvement. In light of recent 'shortcomings' in our administration we should look into making various policy changes and reforms for a better future."

GER_black_monday_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of Black Monday"
GER_black_monday_aftermath_desc:0 "The great stock market crash of 1936, widely known as 'Black Monday', has already had a massive impact on German politics, culture, and society. While the damage might never be truly known, let alone fixed, we should enact reforms and recovery policies to regain some of our lost capacity."

GER_mil_industry_2:0 "PEkI I"
GER_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the civilian industry horribly, and the military industry has been affected even worse. Our military supply specialists are clamouring for a programme for the extension of war-relevant industries, or Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien, to ensure our military has bullets to fight."

GER_mil_industry_3:0 "PEkI II"
GER_mil_industry_3_desc:0 "The Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien - or abbreviated PEkI, but who would want to abbreviate such a good, German word - is making progress. At least our arsenals don't have to open their last reserves whenever a unit wants to move out anymore. There's still some way to go, but at least we are on the right path."

GER_civ_industry_1:0 "ZIP I"
GER_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is in shambles, with many workers out of a job after their former employers were forced to submit to the crisis. Some of our leading economic researchers have proposed a plan for civil industrialisation, the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan, to revitalise the civilian industrial sector."

GER_civ_industry_2:0 "ZIP II"
GER_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "The first phase of the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan has shown promise, but there is more yet to come. At least some of the worst social and economic disaster has been alleviated, though."

GER_civ_industry_3:0 "ZIP III"
GER_civ_industry_3_desc:0 "With our civilian industry once again strong, but not yet booming, we are required to take just a few more steps. Soon enough German industry will tower above the rest of the world once more, as the steady influx of resources from the colonies assures a massive production boost."

GER_further_siemens_contracts:0 "Siemens Favouritism"
GER_further_siemens_contracts_desc:0 "With our shift recovery owned much to the efforts of Siemens, the government has seen to it that they are further "favoured" in regarding any new construction contracts."

GER_arms_industry:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
GER_arms_industry_desc:0 "With unrest in the West and the bear awakening in the East, Germany for then ever needs to be ready for the challenges that are ahead of it. With investing in our local arms producers, we will ensure the German soldier is well equipped for the challenges that lay ahead"


GER_industry_finished:0 "Economic Boom"
GER_industry_finished_desc:0 "With our economic policies following the Black Monday widely regarded as a resounding success, private investors have picked up on the lead, and the economy has not only stabilised but is currently experiencing a boom of sorts. It won't hold forever, but for the minute at least we can concentrate on other pressing issues."

GER_siemens:0 "Subsidies for Siemens"
GER_siemens_desc:0 "Siemens is one of the many middle-to-larger sized businesses that form the heart of the German economy. By making contracts with them - and some other smaller industry companies - we can begin treading the slow and steady path to economic recovery."

GER_krupp_steel_focus:0 "Krupp Steel"
GER_krupp_steel_focus_desc:0 "All this talk about infrastructure and helping our citizens is nice, yes, but what about artillery? Tanks? Planes? The world isn't safe, and Friedrich Krupp AG has the solutions we need! They've served Germany for generations, and the time has come to call on them again."

GER_infra_1:0 "Deutsche Bahn"
GER_infra_1_desc:0 "Germany is a large, busy nation, and the most practical solution for transporting goods and supplies is definitely locomotives. Funding a quick project to touch up our rail-system and extend it to some more rural parts of the country will stimulate the economy and help connect the nation a bit more."

GER_infra_2:0 "Reichsautobahn"
GER_infra_2_desc:0 "Trains are now, but cars are the future. Reichskanzler Tirpitz ordered the construction of several highways throughout Germany, but the projects remain uncompleted--Worse, progress has all but stalled in the wake of Black Monday. We need to not only complete this project, but think even bigger..."

GER_infra_3:0 "Europabahn"
GER_infra_3_desc:0 "Mitteleuropa is large and impressive on paper, but we just aren't making the most of it. Several regions, especially Eastern Europe, are not connected to Germany properly. A main reason for this are the underdeveloped and poorly maintained rail systems that result in constant logistical bottlenecks. We can fix this, and we will."

GER_economy:0 "State of the Economy"
GER_economy_desc:0 "It's good, really. The industry is humming along, the grain is coming in from the eastern member states of the Reichspakt, many citizens have work. It's looking up for the Kaiserreich, and it seems like nothing will be able to stop the golden age of the late Reichskanzler Tirpitz..."

GER_research_expansion:0 "Extra Research Funding"
GER_research_expansion_desc:0 "Investing in science and technology to stimulate advances in both military and civilian affairs. Isn't that an awfully good phrase? It doesn't really say anything, but it sure sounds good. Anyway, the laboratories are over there..."

GER_ig_farben:0 "Embrace Synthetic Rubber"
GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "With increasing demand of rubber skyrocketing prices, we should remind the world that the first synthetic rubber was created in the Bayer laboratories in Elberfield, and as such we can employ the minds of our chemists to further refine the methods of creating it, to augment our sources of natural rubber."

GER_krupp_focus:0 "Krupp AG Contracts"
GER_krupp_focus_desc:0 "The Krupps are an almost 400 year old dynasty of industrious Germans, who have fed the Reich's war machine ever since the Thirty Years War! It is time we put them in state employment again, as their talents will be badly needed with a new Weltkrieg imminent."

GER_artillery_research:0 "Artillery Research"
GER_artillery_research_desc:0 "An area in which the German army has a longstanding tradition of lagging behind is the area of light support artillery. While the successes in building huge, unwieldy and impractical prestige objects such as the 'Paris Gun' can't be doubted, it's time to invest in some of the more practical - and more efficient - alternatives."

GER_doctrine_armor:0 "Armoured Breakthrough"
GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Another crucial point of Guderian and Manstein's new doctrine is the so-called Schwerpunkt. They believe that Panzer technology has advanced to a point where massed, mobile Panzer forces, with adequately equipped support troops, should be able to lead any offensive to victory. Now they need new Panzers to fit this idea."

GER_hahn_meitner:0 "Support Hahn & Meitner"
GER_hahn_meitner_desc:0 "Herr Hahn and Fräulein Meitner are both extremely talented physicists; Hahn is regularly published in science journals even in the Syndicalist bloc, and Meitner is a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute! Together, we believe, the two can help create extremely powerful tools for society. And even more powerful weapons."

GER_rocket:0 "Support von Braun"
GER_rocket_desc:0 "Von Braun is a notorious proponent for the field of 'Rocketry' and is the most accredited scientist for the field worldwide. He comes to us with the offer of new weaponised designs in return for sponsorship. We should heavily consider this."

GER_zuse:0 "Support Konrad Zuse"
GER_zuse_desc:0 "Konrad Zuse has already handed in several patents for what he calls a 'computing devices'. With proper sponsorship, his mind could be put to good use by the state, for the state."

GER_black_monday_radio:0 "The Kanzler and the Radio"
GER_black_monday_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the German's belief in their country. Public faith is key, so starting weekly radio addresses to announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis will help avoid panic and keep trust in our administration."

GER_groener1:0 "Liquidate Unprofitable Estates"
GER_groener1_desc:0 "The statesman Wilhelm Groener has recently published an essay titled 'The black zero: the need for austerity', in which he demands absolute balance discipline, even if it means losing some companies depending on subsidies. The essay has found a lot of adherents within the populace, and liquidating a few unprofitable companies may be just what we need to alleviate our expenditures."

GER_groener2:0 "Reichsarbeitsdienst"
GER_groener2_desc:0 "The contacts and friends of Groener in military circles have now proposed a radical innovation. For the duration of the crisis, recruits will be able to choose to fulfil half a year of military service as manual labourers in state service instead. While bad for recruitment numbers, this will inject some much needed labour into our economy."

GER_groener3:0 "Gehaltskürzung"
GER_groener3_desc:0 "Cutting the enormous salaries of those "Officials" who can more then afford to do so, hasn't been met with open arms. Many have called Groener a Syndicalist in sheep clothing, but quickly retracted their statements on threat of release of their "Expenses" during the crisis. Though it would appear the Groener won't be invited to any social gatherings amongst the aristocracy for quite some time."

GER_schacht1:0 "Bail Out Junker Estates"
GER_schacht1_desc:0 "The president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, has demanded a green light to go ahead with his economic programme, dubbed the 'Schachtplan'. According to him, we need to bail out the highly indebted Junker estates if we don't want to trigger an even further descent into chaos."

GER_schacht2:0 "Investitionsprogramm"
GER_schacht2_desc:0 "The next part of the Schachtplan would be a massive programme aiming to encourage private investment, both into Mittelstand businesses as well as consumer products. While this will be hard to achieve, it should enable producers to find a market for their products again, which will hopefully help to restart the economy."

GER_schacht3:0 "Goldstandard"
GER_schacht3_desc:0 "By dropping the standard of gold within the Empire, will allow for productivity to grow due to further reliance on the Mark. Though many have argued against this, stating the effects of Black Monday are more short term then long term, Schacht reply is that short term effects are crippling the Empire and allowing for it's competition to get ahead."

GER_zollverein:0 "Reform Mitteleuropa"
GER_zollverein_desc:0 "For too long Mitteleuropa has existed in name only. It is time for is to start reforming it to actually benefit its members...and us. The first step is unified tariffs."

GER_synthetic:0 "Research in Synthetics"
GER_synthetic_desc:0 "In cooperation with members of the Kaiser Wilhelm society, IG Farben researchers have already been able to make astounding breakthroughs on the area of synthetic production. By giving them access to more funds, we might be able to make their research ready for mass implementation."

GER_experimental_research:0 "Experimental Research"
GER_experimental_research_desc:0 "While we have already made good progress in some of the more traditional fields relevant to industry - engineering, chemistry, physics - some of our scientists want funding to conduct research into some more esoteric matters. Though profit might not be as immediate, the long-term potential is immense!"

GER_black_monday_finish:0 "Finish Black Monday Reforms"
GER_black_monday_finish_desc:0 "It seemed impossible, but the numbers confirm it - the crisis is nearing its end. The key point is that it is not yet over. There are still millions without jobs, and civil society has been stretched to breaking point. The catastrophe of Black Monday will leave marks for a generation, but this is the beginning of the end."

GER_organize_the_youth:0 "Organise the Youth"
GER_organize_the_youth_desc:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness in our nation's youth would be organising them so that they can learn new skills and employ their energy for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."

GER_a_christian_trade_union:0 "A Christian Trade Union"
GER_a_christian_trade_union_desc:0 "By founding the Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund as a state-endorsed union, we will hopefully establish a bulwark against attacks on the workers' loyalty from left and right. Workers will be able to voice their concerns under the moral authority of priests and the guiding hand of the 'summus episcopus': the Kaiser."

GER_jet:0 "Cult of Aviation"
GER_jet_desc:0 "The image of the aviator has changed in the current conflict. They have replaced the cavalry as the image of the glorious and gallant war. Every child aspires to be an aviator and streak across the skies in his shining armour. By further fostering this image, we can motivate our pilots to give their very best in the service of the Reich."

GER_linie1:0 "Reactivate the Ludendorfflinie"
GER_linie1_desc:0 "The Syndicalist menace looms darker than ever. In fear of going into the next war unprepared, the reactivation of the old Ludendorfflinie on our western border is considered vital. Once one of the dictator's many costly prestige projects, the line of bunkers and fortifications has fallen into disuse in recent years. This is nothing that cannot be solved with a bit of engineering ingenuity!"

GER_linie2_full:0 "Over the Meuse and Far Away"
GER_linie2_full_desc:0 "Our puppet regime in Brüssel is screaming for help against the Syndicalists. Extending the reactivation of the Ludendorfflinie over the Meuse river and up to the North Sea coast would be costly and take up precious time - but it might enable us to make a stand on foreign soil so that not one German civilian is threatened."

GER_linie2_small:0 "Fortify Bastenach Alone"
GER_linie2_small_desc:0 "Our resources are stretched thin and time is of the essence. Even though Flanders-Wallonia may lie somewhat undefended compared to the Franco-German border, we cannot afford to waste time defending foreign territory that will be lost sooner or later anyway."

GER_linie3:0 "Fortify the Rhineland"
GER_linie3_desc:0 "The Rhineland is the most heavily industrialised region in the entire world and absolutely vital to our economy, both in peace and in war. All the same, it lies only a few miles away from a border that many have been eyeing nervously in recent months. In order to prepare against any eventualities, we should start extending the Ludendorflinie northwards."

GER_schule:0 "Paderborner Luftkriegsschule"
GER_schule_desc:0 "The establishment of a formalised school for our aviators would help immensely in unifying and promoting this currently somewhat disorganised field. There are a lot of heroes of air warfare from the Weltkrieg, the most famous of course being the Red Baron himself, whose insight can still be valuable to new recruits. There, they could impart their wisdom to a new generation of German pilots."

GER_institut:0 "Institut für Luftfahrttechnik"
GER_institut_desc:0 "An independent research organisation for aviation technology, the Institut für Luftfahrttechnik, could prove a major stepping stone on the way to ensuring German dominance not only on the ground and on the sea, but also in the skies."

GER_heerflieger:0 "Keep the Fliegertruppe"
GER_heerflieger_desc:0 "Our aviators are currently organised as part of our army structure, without an independent air force command. This boosts cooperation between aviators and ground troops, and therefore leads to the current doctrine concentrating solely on that; air support with ground force primacy. This specialisation is suitable and should remain our policy."

GER_luftwaffe:0 "An Independent Luftwaffe"
GER_luftwaffe_desc:0 "Since the Weltkrieg the Red Baron, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, has argued for the establishment of an independent air force - the Luftwaffe, as he likes to call it. Up until very recently, the conservative elements in the traditionally more prestigious ground forces have been able to prohibit this, but with war looming once again, it might be time to consider the Baron's idea."

GER_sturzflieger:0 "Sturzflieger"
GER_sturzflieger_desc:0 "One concept that has recently found a lot of supporters among aviation researchers is that of an aircraft that dives from great heights onto the battlefield to deliver its payload, using its momentum to climb again immediately afterwards. This concept, dubbed Sturzflieger, would minimise the time our precious aircraft would be in immediate danger."

GER_cas:0 "Coordinated Close Air Support"
GER_cas_desc:0 "The requirements and possible uses of close air support aircraft have proven to be far different from those of more mainstream fighter aircraft. If we concentrate our air research capabilities on identifying and exploiting the intricacies of this specialised form of air warfare, we should be able to achieve far better results in aircraft manufacturing."

GER_para:0 "Found the Luftlandetruppe"
GER_para_desc:0 "Due to our continuing focus on ground-air cooperation, there have been proposals of greatly expanding our Paratrooper division, which is currently in its infancy. This might have to do something with the fact that jumping from a flying plane does not seem very glorious or entertaining - or survivable, really. We should promote the image of the paratrooper as the spearhead of the Kaiser's military."

GER_bombergruppen:0 "Bombergruppen Doctrine"
GER_bombergruppen_desc:0 "One of the first results of the founding of Richthofen's Luftwaffe has been the invention of a new doctrine. This doctrine asserts that the possibilities of massed bomber warfare are exciting enough to warrant primacy over the traditional ground support. Fighters should not be used on the ground, where they can be subjected to anti-air attacks, but in the skies where they can escort bomber squadrons."

GER_singapore_airstrips:0 "Expand Singapur Airstrips"
GER_singapore_airstrips_desc:0 "Singapur is the centrepoint of German East Asia. A fortress city, it has great demands for both civilian as well as military airstrips. We should meet this pressing need by investing in construction to protect our naval station from foreign rivals in the region."

GER_finalise_centralisation:0 "Finalise Centralisation"
GER_finalise_centralisation_desc:0 "The independent postal services of the kingdoms of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany are some of the last remnants of the old federal structure of Germany. By finally expanding the responsibilities of the national German postal service to these states, we could help suppress these damaging particularist tendencies. Germany is not something you can opt out of!"

GER_democracy_in_prussia:0 "Democracy in Prussia"
GER_democracy_in_prussia_desc:0 "The current voting system in Prussia is archaic and undemocratic. The people are split into three strata according to their income, with the lowest strata, representing over sixty percent of the population, receiving as many delegates as the upper one, which represents less than ten percent! We should finally implement universal, secret and equal franchise for all citizens of Germany."

GER_easter_promises:0 "The Easter Promises"
GER_easter_promises_desc:0 "On April 7th 1917, when the war was at its very worst, after the horrifying 'Turnip Winter', the Kaiser promised substantial reforms and the abolition of the three-class voting system in Prussia. However, he promised all of that without offering an actual date. It might be time to remind the Kaiser of his promises..."

GER_embrace_faud:0 "Embrace the FAUD"
GER_embrace_faud_desc:0 "The Freie Arbeiterunion Deutschlands has been a troublesome organisation. By embracing them and finally allowing them to operate unhindered, we could maybe make sure that they don't radicalise further."

GER_women_suffrage:0 "Women's Suffrage"
GER_women_suffrage_desc:0 "While the Prussians now finally have their universal, secret and equal franchise, the women of Germany are still exempt from the vote. Awareness of this issue has been steadily rising, and clubs modelled on the British suffragettes are recruiting new members. If we want to avoid the public embarrassment that the British suffered in that affair, we should maybe consider fulfilling their requests."

GER_schleicher:0 "Polizeiaufgabengesetz"
GER_schleicher_desc:0 "Because of the threat from the International, we can't afford to endanger the security of the Reich through improper liberalization. It would be best if we first ensure that there is still a Reich in the future, so we should expand the powers of our police so that they can better enforce the law in these dangerous times! As for the reforms... our people will soon understand that we are only acting for their own good and that we'll continue them as soon as the situation allows."

GER_schleicher_prerequisite:0 "Requires §YKurt von Schleicher§! to be the head of government."

GER_restore_country_rights:0 "Restore the Bundesrat"
GER_restore_country_rights_desc:0 "Under the Ludendorff regime, many of the privileges of the constituent countries of Germany were abolished. The largest of these insults was the formal dissolution of the Bundesrat, the chamber where delegates from all countries can voice their concerns and vote on empire-wide legislature. By reinstating this organisation, we would send a powerful and positive signal to the states of Germany."

GER_babelsberg:0 "Expand Babelsberg"
GER_babelsberg_desc:0 "The Babelsberg film studios have long replaced Hollywood as the most influential film industry of the world. However, on movies as far removed from politics as possible, is anything but supportive of the state. Some producers, namely Leni Riefenstahl, have proposed some projects that, with our funding, could help remind the Germans of their glorious past and future."

GER_europakammer:0 "Europarat"
GER_europakammer_desc:0 "There have been recent proposals swirling around for a new body to increase integration of Mitteleuropa. Europarat, or the 'Council of Europe' would act as an effective monitor of cross-European trade and relieve the administrative burden of it on all Mitteleuropa."

GER_europakommission:0 "Europakommission"
GER_europakommission_desc:0 "With the resounding success of the initial Mitteleuropa reforms we shall expand and extend it to include further industrial measures under a single Europakommission. This body would focus on harmonising industrial regulations across Mitteleuropa and unifying the economies of all members over time."

GER_poland_war:0 "Bring Back Order"
GER_poland_war_desc:0 "Poland has been a diplomatic oddity in Europe for far too long. Stuck in political limbo between the German and Austrian power blocs since the end of the Weltkrieg, it is time for proper German order to be brought back to the Polish state. Either through strong diplomatic effort or by force of arms, Poland will be brought into the German sphere where it belongs."

GER_poland_alliance:0 "Deepen Polish Ties"
GER_poland_alliance_desc:0 "Our initial forays into improving diplomatic ties with Poland have met with some amount of success. It seems that Poland too wishes to settle our past disputes and break the political stalemate of the past two decades. A proper diplomatic mission to Poland should warm our mutual relations and set the foundation for Poland to eventually move into our own sphere of influence."
GER_destroy_internationale:0 "Destroy the Internationale"
GER_destroy_internationale_desc:0 "The greatest threat to stability in the world is by far the Syndicalists, and they have no greater stronghold than the Internationale. For years, High Command has dreamed of leading troops into Paris again, restoring order in Europe and eradicating the vile Red Menace forever. There is no better time than now to strike. Let the communards tremble, for the Reichspakt comes!"

GER_subjugate_russia:0 "Subjugate Russia"
GER_subjugate_russia_desc:0 "While we dealt the Russian Bear a crippling blow in the Weltkrieg, years of covert and open rearmament have made the Russian nation eager for war and revenge against the German Empire. As long as the Russian threat exists on the eastern border, Germany and her allies are not safe. We cannot continue to let the menace of the East continue to build up its strength gradually; it is time to curb Russia's ambition and bring peace and order to the East once and for all."

GER_oil_caucasus_land:0 "Through Ukraine"
GER_oil_caucasus_land_desc:0 "One route to ensuring that we have uninterrupted oil supplies is by securing access across the great steppe from the Don-Kuban Union of the proud Cossacks.

GER_oil_caucasus_treaty_desc:0 "The time has come for us to acquire our main prize, the oil of Azerbaijan.

GER_Research_Cooperation_desc:0 "Ottoman scientific expertise is severely lacking as for one the literacy rate of the Sublime Porte is abominable. Furthermore, the Sublime Porte was never really able to catch up with the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods.

From geographical features such as the Suez to the Caucasus to strategic ones such as the Oil fields of Iraq and the Chromite mines of Anatolia, the Ottoman Empire is an invaluable cog in the great machine of the Kaiser."

Many believe that order to stay in power the SPD must navigate a fine line between social democracy and anything that may be considered syndicalism.

GER_denounce_marxism_desc:0 "Contrary to what the vile Syndicalists of France and Great Britain seem to think, the father of modern Socialism, Karl Marx, was never closed to the idea of the establishment of a Socialist society from a Capitalist society, the proof is that he never really expressed in an explicit way the way of taking power by the workers and that he showed himself in several of his texts to be in favor of political, economic and parliamentary action within the liberal regime. It is hardly that the Syndicalists had never really read this author, perhaps this is due to their barely hidden Germanophobia which they let show through their revanchist propaganda. Because yes, we must not forget it, but Marx is above all a hero of the workers who is German, France and Great Britain having never invented Socialism, preferring tyrannical and authoritarian regimes. The SPD must follow the path traced by Marx and fulfill his will through Reformism, Democracy, Freedom and Socialism, and away from extremism and tyranny!"

GER_healthcare_reform_desc:0 "The idea of universal healthcare is a German one, with 1883's Sickness Insurance Law the first of its kind in the world. The law isn't perfect though, as it allows employers to deduct a portion of a worker's paycheck to fund their insurance, and does nothing for the unemployed. We must take this idea one step further, and offer free insurance to the unemployed as well as subsidize businesses to the shoulder the cost of their employees' healthcare as well as prohibit deductions."

gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the Federation and four other states in southern Germany. The new constitutional framework created integrated the southern states into the Prussian-led Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the Empire is a federation of twenty-five German states. The title of Bundespräsidium, or Federation President, was held by the King of Prussia, a figure now invested with the title of Emperor of Germany. The Emperor directly appoints the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws are enacted by both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the lower house Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years.\n\nWith an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire actually rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained mostly unchanged since 1849.\n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with the status quo and our constitution may need revision soon to help us weather the upcoming turbulence..."

gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the complacent agricultural sector of the German economy has proven to be particularly vulnerable to the economic downturn. With this in mind several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and state subsidies for their agricultural production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this vital sector of the Reich's economy and protect our farmers. Unfortunately such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, dependent as they are on German markets for their food exports. The wheat crop in the Ukraine is particularly vulnerable, and choosing to enact protectionist measures might seriously damage them and our other agrarian partners."

In these troubled times for the Empire, we must be careful in formulating a policy response liable to cause domestic tensions. Granting the suffragists what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, particularly members of the Reichstag, a body currently elected solely by universal male suffrage. On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to further protests and riots, especially in the more liberal states, many of which already permit female voting in regional assemblies."

Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence time and time again. For these reasons, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again that the government grant women the right to vote and to run for office."

In recent weeks the streets of many German cities have been increasingly terrorised by gangs of teenagers. These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism to escape boredom and frustration. Few citizens feel safe on the streets anymore and it is clear that what some in the government might see merely as low-level civic disorder instead has the makings of total societal breakdown."

gerdom.18.d:0 "While there is no shortage of capable thinkers in our Staff, one may argue that the issue we currently face is actually having too many of them. Currently, the Staff has divided itself into three groups of competing thought.\n\nProponents of an infiltration-focused doctrine, backed by Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, argue that the fighting spirit of the infantry and well-trained battalions backed with the highest quality weapons available acting in perfect coordination is the key to success.\n\nMeanwhile, Georg Bruchmüller, a seasoned officer from the Weltkrieg, proposes an artillery-focused doctrine with an emphasis on heavy bombardment to facilitate a breakthrough, replacing the infantry charges of old with even more shells than we've traditionally used.\n\nFinally, the least popular group of theorists led by Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian passionately argue for a large tank army backed up with motorized and mechanized infantry, envisioning an armored breakthrough with coordinated air support to get behind the enemy's lines.\n\nDuring a typical briefing with the Kaiser on the military, Heinz Guderian initiated an especially inflammatory argument with Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord on the matter of production priorities. While seemingly trivial, these arguments have been becoming more common as of late over every minor detail.\n\nThe situation has reached a boiling point, and it falls on the aging Wilhelm to come to a decision. Who has his support?"

gerdom.19.t:0 "Choosing a Weapons Manufacturer"
gerdom.19.d:0 "As the world continues to become more dangerous, many in our government are suggesting that we could benefit from selecting a single arms manufacturer to standardize production and equipment standards. Naturally, German industry is robust and we have several choices available to us!\n\nMauser, dating all the way back to 1811, is perhaps the most obvious choice. They have a global presence, and have provided us with weapons for years--Such as the sturdy and reliable bolt-action Karabiner 98k.\n\nHaenel has been around since 1840, and is a smaller and less likely choice. However, there is a remarkable simplicity and sturdiness about their weapons that we can use. They also have some interesting ideas for weapons that can fire multiple bullets without needing to be bolted back with every shot!\n\nMostly, Walther, founded in in Ulm back in 1886, makes pistols--Good ones. However, they could easily accommodate our needs with just a bit of funding. Their weapons are well-rounded, but don't particularly excel in any one area.\n\nSauer & Sohn is the oldest of them all. If anyone could get us plenty of guns quickly, it would be them. Time is short, and we need to get a substantial army in the field; it might be best to just get a weapon in our men's hands as long as it fires.\n\nWe have the forms filled out and ready. Who do we send them to?"
gerdom.19.a:0 "Mauser, as always."

Another possibility would be a coalition of nearly all liberal and burgeois parties - NLP, FVP and Bavarian splinter party BVP - against the old DkP, led by the beloved Lion of Africa, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck.

What has not been decided, however, is how far this meeting with the Pope will go and what exactly will be discussed. We could either embark on a new relation with the Papacy and the Catholic world in general, or merely exchange pleasantries. Our coalition partners in the mostly Protestant DkP have threatened to make passing future legislation more difficult if we take this too far, so we may want to tread carefully. On the other hand, having friends on the Italian peninsula as well as investing in Catholic-led industry may be reward enough."

They have repeatedly denounced the Syndicalist terror and therefore been allowed to operate unimpeded until now, however our intelligence services have produced definite proof that their leaders are in contact with Syndicalist organisations in other nations, such as the CNT-FAI in Spain.

gerdom.74.t:0 "The Division of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.74.d:0 "As part of our new Kaiserbund policy it is incumbent on us to issue directions as new administrative arrangements in our colonies. One such territory is Mittelafrika. While conservative members of Reichstag are eager to leave the autonomous state unmolested, the bulk of our political establishment have already realised that Freistaat of Mittelafrika acts as a burden for both the German armed forces and our economy. Among the limited benefits the colony offers us is imperial prestige, and even then the Dark Continent is no longer seen in the same light as during Scramble for Afrika. Therefore, drastic reorganisation of this area is needed if we want to retain our presence in Afrika with while limiting our costs as much as possible."

One such region is the German Somaliland.

One such region is Aden in the Yemen.

gerdom.85.t:0 "Germany Bans French Organisations!"
gerdom.85.d:0 "In response to the increasing self-assurance and revolutionary spirit of the Commune, the pathetic German leadership has instituted a harsh policy of cracking down on any organisations funded by us or related to French culture or politics in any manner. These discriminatory actions aimed against the struggling French minority within Germany, particularly in our occupied regions of Nancy and Alsace, are absolutely intolerable."

gerdom.86.t:0 "International Condemnation of Our Ban!"
gerdom.86.d:0 "The Commune of France used our recent actions aimed against all French organisations within the German Empire to organise an international conference on the issue. They publicly condemned what they call 'German Imperialism' and pledged to do everything possible to protect the French minority within the Reich. In response, several important members of the international community similarly condemned our actions against the French population, stating that such actions are a stain on the honour of a modern state. How should we react to this public humiliation?"
gerdom.86.a:0 "The Communards are behind this, destroy them!"
gerdom.86.b:0 "Germany cares not for the protests of minnows."
gerdom.86.c:0 "Restore the rights of the French minority."

gerdom.91.d:0 "The German Empire decided to send an official military mission to our homeland in order to help us improve our obsolete armed forces. Such missions are well regarded for their impact on the militaries of nations like Ukraine and Venezuela, and we are fortunate to have them."
gerdom.91.a:0 "We will show them Cossack hospitality!"

gerdom.92.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck and the Flame of German Resistance"
gerdom.92.d:0 "This is the darkest hour of the German Empire. Defeated by the planes, tanks and tactics of a brutal foe, the imperial government has evacuated Berlin and is currently converging, shell-shocked and battered, on Daressalam. However, the army is not Germany itself, and under the African skies our loyal colonies remain committed to the war effort. All the same, the Reich's government as it stands is facing loathing for presiding over the greatest military catastrophe in German history, and many senior army officers are demanding the appointment of a new emergency chancellor. Many of them are clamouring for Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to be elevated to this position, given his successes in Afrika during the Weltkrieg and the loyalty and affection that he commands among the askaris we must now rely on."
gerdom.92.a:0 "Yes! Appoint von Lettow-Vorbeck! Heia Safari!"
gerdom.92.b:0 "No! This would be the last nail in the coffin of our democracy!"

gerdom.93.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck Proposes an 'Afrikakorps'"
gerdom.93.d:0 "Chancellor von Lettow-Vorbeck has stood before the emergency government and argued that the German state must raise additional units of native schutztruppen, also known as askaris. These doughty soldiers have served the Reich faithfully ever since the chancellor outwitted the Entente in the jungles of Ostafrika during the Weltkrieg. Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck has also proposed that we grant the native kings, princes and vassals that rule Afrika in our stead complete independence once we retake our Vaterland. Such a reward would incentivise our native population and leaders and invigorate them to assist us in getting to Berlin. This is a desperate proposal, but the Reich is going through desperate times."
gerdom.93.a:0 "Rally the askaris from all of Mittelafrika!"
gerdom.93.b:0 "Pointless. We need German troops for a German war!"

gerdom.94.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Südwestafrika"
gerdom.94.d:0 "One of the first German colonies, Südwestafrika has proven especially loyal to the imperial government. However, its close connection with the founding of the German colonial empire might make it difficult for conservatives within our cabinet to accept the prospect of independence that has promised by von Lettow-Vorbeck."
gerdom.94.a:0 "Excellent."

gerdom.95.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Ostafrika"
gerdom.95.d:0 "The site of some of the most impressive battles fought by the German colonial army under von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg, Ostafrika, with its capital of Daressalam, is seen by most officials as the jewel in the crown of the Reich's African possessions. As such the German administration is deeply entrenched here and cooperation with the natives run smoothly, resulting in a large turnout of volunteers for the new Schutztruppen."

gerdom.96.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Kongo"
gerdom.96.d:0 "Taken from the defeated Belgian state after the Weltkrieg, the Congo occupies the heart of Central Africa and has for decades of German administration been heavily militarised to secure the Reich's control over the province."

gerdom.97.d:0 "Strategically located to the immediate south of the Sahara, the colony of German Equatorial Africa employs some of the most impressive auxiliary troops, most of which have spent years fighting nomadic raiders on the border."

gerdom.98.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Niger-Kamerun"
gerdom.98.d:0 "One of the more recently acquired African provinces, Niger was merged with the German colony of Kamerun in the Mittelafrikan state. Though somewhat disunited, the natives stand ready to earn their independence in the pay of the Reich!"

gerdom.99.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Togoland"
gerdom.99.d:0 "Consisting of the original German colony of Togo and the annexed British and French colonies of the Gold Coast and Dahomey, the askaris formed here are of a notably lesser quality than seen elsewhere in Mittelafrika. All the same, they stand ready to assist Germany in its hour of need - for the right price."

gerdom.100.t:0 "Decolonisation of Afrika"
gerdom.100.d:0 "In the darkest hour of the German Empire, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck rallied the colonial askaris behind the Reich by promising them independence once the war had been won. Our enemies have been crushed and Berlin liberated, leading to many of our African subjects humbly asking us to uphold our promises and commence the decolonisation of our domains in Africa."
gerdom.100.a:0 "We shall uphold our promises."
gerdom.100.b:0 "Afrika shall remain German forever more!"

### Security ###

gerdom.105.t:0 "Germany Suppresses its French Population!"
gerdom.105.d:0 "The German Empire, afraid of the rising power of our state decided to tighten control of the border regions, since they are fearful of our growing influence! We must be patient, soon the time will come, when our brothers in Wallonia, Lorraine and Alsace shall be liberated!"
gerdom.105.a:0 "Soon, our time shall come!"

gerdom.106.t:0 "Further Internal Security Measures"
gerdom.106.d:0 "Despite the gradual increase of military and police presence in our border region, it is still not enough. Underground French Syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning the minds of our French minority with propaganda, with many using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, right-wing members of our government have demanded the complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation in the international community..."
gerdom.106.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient!"
gerdom.106.b:0 "It's time to ban all French organisations in Germany!"
gerdom.106.c:0 "This plan was madness from the beginning, abandon it..."

### Rhenish Syndicalist Volunteers ###

gerdom.200.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Requests Visa"
gerdom.200.d:0 "For some time now, Syndicalist sympathisers from the Rhineland have been going abroad to help their 'comrades' in their various conflicts around the world. Today, the famous underground writer Bertolt Brecht has announced his intent to join these 'International Divisions'.\n\nWe could let him go, which would most likely inspire quite a number of other Syndicalists to go abroad after him, or we could confiscate his passport and prohibit him from leaving the country. As Brecht is a prominent figure, blocking him could perhaps weaken the Syndicalist cause, but on the other hand it would likely cause tremendous outrage..."
gerdom.200.aa:0 "Let him go to wild America."
gerdom.200.ab:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
gerdom.200.ac:0 "He can go to Brazil if he wants."
gerdom.200.ad:0 "Let's hope he freezes in Russia."
gerdom.200.ae:0 "He can sweat in Spain."
gerdom.200.af:0 "We should keep him where we can watch him."

gerdom.201.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in America"
gerdom.201.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.201.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.202.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Brazil"
gerdom.202.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.202.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.203.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Russia"
gerdom.203.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.203.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.204.t:0 "German Volunteers Arrive in Spain"
gerdom.204.d:0 "Two German volunteer divisions, headed by the writer Bertolt Brecht and other figures of the German Syndicalist scene, have arrived to support us in our struggle!"
gerdom.204.a:0 "Die Internationale erkämpft das Menschenrecht!"

gerdom.205.t:0 "Calm in the Rhineland"
gerdom.205.d:0 "With a number of prominent Syndicalists out of the country and allowed to fight, and hopefully die, in foreign lands, tensions in our lands have decreased greatly without their malign influence. The Rhineland is finally seeing some peace and quiet."
gerdom.205.a:0 "Let's hope things stay this way."

gerdom.206.t:0 "Policy on Returning Syndicalists"
gerdom.206.d:0 "Now that their war has been lost, the 'International Divisions' formed from our volunteers are trying to return to their homes. Many still have their arms and all survivors are battle-hardened, indoctrinated Syndicalists. However, if we prohibit them from entering over our borders, we should be able to keep them away without much of a scandal due to the hardening of the German population's views on the Red Menace. Still, we might risk them turning against us when we inevitably come to blows with the Internationale."
gerdom.206.a:0 "They'll have to serve their term in the Heer!"
gerdom.206.b:0 "Let them return to their families."
gerdom.206.c:0 "Close the borders!"

gerdom.207.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Dies in Suspicious Circumstances"
gerdom.207.d:0 "Though rumours have been spreading for weeks, we now have official confirmation; Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has died in some rotten cellar, most likely at the hands of foreign police. After serving abroad as Syndicalist volunteer, Brecht was blocked from re-entering Germany.\n\nHis family, together with other Syndicalist elements, staged scale demonstrations in Berlin, blaming our hardline policy towards Syndicalist volunteers for his death."
gerdom.207.a:0 "It seems that we have created a martyr."

gerdom.208.t:0 "Bertolt Brecht Returns to Germany"
gerdom.208.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, it seems like the Syndicalist writer Bertolt Brecht has somehow managed to smuggle himself over the border. He and his family have gone underground and the controversial figure is openly preaching for solidarity by the workers against the capitalist system."
gerdom.208.a:0 "Can't he ever shut up?!"

gerdom.209.t:0 "International Divisions Offer Their Service"
gerdom.209.d:0 "After valiantly fighting for the Syndicalist cause, the comrades and veterans of the International Divisions have cowardly been denied entrance to their own homeland in Germany. After months of drifting, many of the former members have now reassembled and decided to take up arms to liberate Germany from the scourge of imperialism. While their numbers have been reduced by fighting and poverty, they are battle-hardened veterans and would make a worthy addition to the forces of the Internationale."
gerdom.209.a:0 "Welcome comrades!"
gerdom.209.b:0 "A needless expense."

gerdom.211.t:0 "Pick-A-Flag"
gerdom.211.d:0 "Welcome to the German Flag Shop, pick your flavour!"
gerdom.211.a:0 "I'll take the classic Reichskriegsflagge."
gerdom.211.b:0 "I will have one order of the black-white-red Tricolor."

### Foreign Events ###

gerfor.1.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Denmark"
gerfor.1.d:0 "The Union of Britain has declared war on Denmark. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Danish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Denmark?"
gerfor.1.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face German arms!"
gerfor.1.b:0 "We have enough problems to be dealing with."

gerfor.2.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Denmark"
gerfor.2.d:0 "The Second Reich has sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Denmark and declare a ceasefire or Germany will come to Denmark's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the Skagerrak and pose a dangerous threat to Germany on its northern border, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
gerfor.2.a:0 "We will not risk war with Germany over this."
gerfor.2.b:0 "We do not negotiate with imperialists."

gerfor.3.t:0 "German Assistance Against Britain"
gerfor.3.d:0 "We are in a state of war with the Union of Britain. Our military, while proud, will not be able to withstand the Syndicalist onslaught. Some influential figures are petitioning us to ask the Germans for help, even if it might mean having to accept some German influence after the invasion is repelled. What shall we do?"
gerfor.3.a:0 "Thank you Berlin!"
gerfor.3.b:0 "The Germans cannot be trusted."

gerfor.4.t:0 "Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.4.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the British Isles. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today. We have shown the world that we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or the Commune."
gerfor.4.a:0 "Yet again German diplomacy wins the day."

gerfor.5.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Denmark Ultimatum"
gerfor.5.d:0 "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Danish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Denmark into our alliance or we can stand down and let Denmark fall, creating a northern front with our Syndicalist foe."
gerfor.5.a:0 "They have made their choice, war it is!"
gerfor.5.b:0 "Back down. There will be peace in our time."

gerfor.6.t:0 "Britain Backs Down Over Denmark"
gerfor.6.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders ordering an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to British territory. Denmark's independence has been preserved and our pride left intact. All the same, the fact that it took German intervention to protect us is somewhat unsettling."
gerfor.6.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without them."

gerfor.7.t:0 "Internationale Seeks to Reunify Italy"
gerfor.7.d:0 "The combined forces of the French Commune and the Socialist Republic of Italy have launched an attempt to seize the entirety of Italy. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in Europe in favour of the Syndicalists. Shall we warn the Internationale that this threatens world peace or let the peninsula fall to their malignant ideology?"

gerfor.8.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Italy"
gerfor.8.d:0 "The German Empire has sent us a telegram, demanding that either we end our intervention in Italy and declare a ceasefire with the Italian states or the Reich will intervene by force."

gerfor.9.t:0 "Germany Sends the Internationale an Ultimatum"
gerfor.9.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France over their support for the Socialist Republic of Italy in its attempts to conquer the entire peninsula. The Germans demand that the Syndicalists fall back or risk utter annihilation."

gerfor.10.t:0 "Commune of France Withdraws from Italy"
gerfor.10.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris, they quickly withdrew their forces from the frontlines and abandoned the peninsula. Our independence will be preserved, and our pride left intact."
gerfor.10.d.sri:0 "Drawing [FRA.GetNameDef] into our war with [ITA.GetNameDef] was perhaps not the wisest idea. The war drew the attention of the Reich which issued an ultimatum to [FRA.GetNameDef] to cease the invasion. The [FRA.GetAdjective] government has complied, ordering our own forces to stand down. We have little choice but to comply."

gerfor.11.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Italy"
gerfor.11.d:0 "After we sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France to cease their intervention in Italy and backing for the Italian Syndicalists in the war, they wisely decided to comply. Already Red forces are withdrawing and our prestige has been greatly heightened. Yet again we have used diplomacy to help guard the balance, and improve prospects for European peace."

gerfor.12.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Italian Ultimatum"
gerfor.12.d:0 "Our ultimatum was flatly ignored. Already SRI and Communard forces are on the march in Italy and refusing to return to their pre-war boundaries. The other states of the Italian peninsula are threatened existentially and Syndicalism is poised to spread its vile ideology to every corner of the land. The issue now is, do we back up our ultimatum with force and declare war on the Internationale?"

gerfor.13.t:0 "Commune of France Invades Spain"
gerfor.13.d:0 "The armed forces of the Commune of France have launched an invasion of the Spanish state. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the syndicalist alliance. Shall we warn the syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or let Spain fall?"

gerfor.14.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Spain"
gerfor.14.d:0 "Monarchies are as thick as thieves. After we began our campaign against the Spanish kingdom we received a message from Berlin ordering us to cease and desist in our military efforts. They claim that if we do not bring our forces back beyond the Pyrenees they will intervene militarily to preserve the current status quo."

gerfor.16.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Spain"
gerfor.16.d:0 "The Germans have achieved a significant diplomatic coup today, and helped preserve our independence. After the Reich sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France ordering them to cease their military aggression towards us, the French wisely decided to comply and brought their troops back from beyond the Pyrenees. The status quo remains, for now at least, intact."

gerfor.17.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Spanish Ultimatum"
gerfor.17.d:0 "Despite our public condemnation of the Communard invasion of the Spanish Kingdom and subsequent ultimatum, the French have refused to pull their forces back. The possibility of the loss of yet another European monarchy can no longer be discounted, and the choice is now incumbent on us to decide how we should respond to this flagrant dismissal of German hegemony."

gerfor.24.t:0 "Enemy at the Gates"
gerfor.24.d:0 "The Russians have reached the Oder. There has been little outright panicking in Berlin but it is clear that without a counter-attack Germany is greatly endangered. The last supply reserves have been distributed to volunteers and everyone is participating in this last effort to defend the Vatherland."
gerfor.24.a:0 "Not one step back!"

gerfor.25.t:0 "Die Wacht am Rhein"
gerfor.25.d:0 "The French have reached the Rhine. Our substantial border fortifications were seemingly unable to stop their inexorable advance and now our crucial industrial cities are falling one after another. The situation is quite dire, and already there are treasonous murmurings that the Communards could reach Berlin itself."
gerfor.25.a:0 "They must be stopped!"

gerfor.27.t:0 "Germany Occupies Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.27.d:0 "The German Empire, in a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."
gerfor.27.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
gerfor.27.b:0 "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

gerfor.28.t:0 "Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.28.d:0 "The island of Madagascar has been under our rule for several decades and it is an untapped source of rare timbers like ebony and several varieties of rosewood. As these sources have not been exploited, several industrialists and members of the colonial government have proposed that we establish a joint-stock company with authority over the timber industry on the island. Shall we decree the establishment of such a company?"
gerfor.28.a:0 "Create a new joint-stock company."
gerfor.28.b:0 "Leave the industry alone."

gerfor.29.t:0 "Expanded Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.29.d:0 "The joint-stock company that we established has began to show some results and our inventory of rare timber has steadily increased. However, with the mechanisation of logging, several thousand locals have been put out of work. The company has at the same time advised that we begin construction on a new timber processing plant to streamline production. If we were to fund this new project it would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."
gerfor.29.a:0 "Create the new processing complex."
gerfor.29.b:0 "In this economy?"

gerfor.30.t:0 "New Madagascan Processing Complex"
gerfor.30.d:0 "The new timber processing complex has opened and the transformative effects on the local economy were immediate. Many workers responsible for the initial construction were retained by the company and many new workers were needed after construction was complete, dramatically increasing employment in the area. The access to rare timbers has also increased and a gala was held in Tananarive to toast the new complex's opening."
gerfor.30.a:0 "A successful colonial endeavour."

gerfor.31.t:0 "Uprising on Madagascar"
gerfor.31.d:0 "With no end in sight to the rising unemployment on Madagascar, many Malagasy locals, and especially the former loggers, have risen against us. What started as merely a local insurrection quickly spiralled into outright rebellion with an independence war brewing."
gerfor.31.a:0 "We really don't need this right now..."

gerfor.32.t:0 "A Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.32.d:0 "With the fall of France our armed forces have unsuccessfully tried to gain control over the British Isles and decisively end the war in our favour. Unfortunately, Republican resistance has proven stronger than we previously anticipated, and attempts to launch a full-scale naval invasion have soured. We can now either continue the armed struggle or try to end this futile conflict by way of a peace treaty."
gerfor.32.a:0 "It is time for an armistice."
gerfor.32.b:0 "This will only end with German boots marching through London."

gerfor.33.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.33.d:0 "Attempts from the Reichspakt to gain a foothold on our island and decisively end the war have failed miserably. Though the collapse of the Commune was a terrible blow to the Revolutionary cause, British arms have proven to be too much for Jerry to handle. Now the leadership of the German Empire is offering us a proposal - to terminate conflict between the Reichspakt and the remaining members of Internationale in exchange for mutual recognition. How shall we react?"
gerfor.33.a:0 "Survival is all we can hope for. Sign."
gerfor.33.b:0 "Another humiliation? Never again!"

gerfor.34.t:0 "Second Peace with Honour Signed"
gerfor.34.d:0 "It is finally done. Though we had hoped for the total obliteration of the Union of Britain and the end to Syndicalist influence in Europe, alas it was not to be. Instead the British wisely decided to make terms with us, signing the treaty in sight of a full German military parade. With this the bulk of the fighting is now over, and the Second Weltkrieg virtually ended in Europe."
gerfor.34.a:0 "Peace at last!"

gerfor.35.t:0 "The British Refused Peace!"
gerfor.35.d:0 "In a staggering display of British stubbornness, the Syndicalist wretches flatly denied our calls for a peace treaty. Instead of swallowing their pride and accepting the inevitable, the Republican government said that they would not have a Second Peace With Honour, and would end the war by marching through Berlin."
gerfor.35.a:0 "They will pay for this insolence."

gerfor.36.t:0 "Ethnic Conflict on Sri Lanka"
gerfor.36.d:0 "Ceylon Island is settled by Sinhalese and Tamils, who have battled for supremacy on the island for ages. With Black Monday wreaking havoc on our economy and colonial administration, disobedience from the native population is becoming intolerable. Our presence on Ceylon, crucial for its supplies of rubber, is becoming increasingly precarious."
gerfor.36.a:0 "Damn those nationalists!"

gerfor.37.t:0 "Union of Britain Invades Norway"
gerfor.37.d:0 "The Union of Britain has made the bold move of declaring war on the Norwegians, seeking to impose Syndicalism on them by force of arms. This invasion shows scant regard for German supremacy in Europe and the status quo that we have spent years maintaining. The question now is, what should our response to be this act of barbarism by the British?"

gerfor.38.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Norway"
gerfor.38.d:0 "We have received a damning telegram from the Reich. They are demanding that either we cease our invasion of Norway or face the full might of the Kaiserliche Marine. They cite the inviolability of sovereign European nations and a whole lot of guff about guarding the balance, but everyone knows that this act stems from German's desperate attempts to hold onto their hegemonic status on the continent. What should our response be?"

gerfor.39.t:0 "Germany Warns the Union of Britain over Norway"
gerfor.39.d:0 "Germany has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain, either fall back to their home islands or risk annihilation."

gerfor.40.t:0 "The Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.40.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or France."

gerfor.41.t:0 "Britain Ignores our Norwegian Ultimatum"
gerfor.41.d:0 "In a display of repugnant audacity, the Union of Britain ignored our ultimatum. North Sea operations do not seem to have altered at all and the Republicans are continuing the war against Norway. We cannot risk the red tide of Syndicalism sinking its tendrils into yet another nation, particularly one important to our strategic interests. At the same time, open war with London would distract us at an inopportune time and potentially lead to the Internationale joining in."

gerfor.42.t:0 "The British Withdraw from Norway"
gerfor.42.d:0 "The Union of Britain appears to have listened to wise counsel, and ceased their operations in the North Sea. The German ultimatum appears to have scared them off, and Syndicalism stopped from claiming yet another scalp."

gerfor.43.t:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
gerfor.43.d:0 "With the Syndicalists awakening all over the world it is crucial for the Reichspakt to help potential allies whenever possible. With Irish sympathies swayed towards Germany due to our support during the War of Independence there now exists the possibility of gaining a strong foothold just under the socialists' noses by getting Ireland into the Reichspakt. We should start by offering them equipment and construction support."
gerfor.43.a:0 "Offer Ireland aid if they join the Reichspakt."

gerfor.44.t:0 "German Offers Support"
gerfor.44.d:0 "The German ambassador has approached us with an offer: if Ireland signs a treaty of association with the Reichspakt Germany will invest in our economy and military. While the benefits from this deal would be immense there are some in the government who are unwilling to rely on foreign aid."
gerfor.44.a:0 "Where do I sign?"
gerfor.44.b:0 "We are doing fine on our own."

gerfor.45.t:0 "Ireland Signs the Treaty"
gerfor.45.d:0 "The Irish have agreed to our offer. According to the treaty we are to supply industrial machines and the licences required to construct additional ones in Ireland itself. Additionally, we are obliged to construct and deliver guns, artillery pieces, and a number of aircraft and armour pieces to bolster their armed forces."
gerfor.45.a:0 "Begin the construction then!"

gerfor.46.t:0 "Ireland Refuses the Treaty"
gerfor.46.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Irish have decided to turn our offer down. Still, our obligations towards Ireland remain the same as they were before."
gerfor.46.a:0 "Oh well."

gerfor.47.t:0 "Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.47.d:0 "We have finally finished preparations of all of the material ordered by the Irish as part of our treaty obligations. The goods are now ready to be delivered and we will give the convoy a military escort all the way to the Ireland."
gerfor.47.a:0 "Get it to Dublin, posthaste."

gerfor.48.t:0 "German Aid Arrives"
gerfor.48.d:0 "The guns, armour, aircraft and industrial machinery that Germany promised us as part of their treaty obligations have finally arrived. We have received a squadron each of fighters and bombers, a number of tanks as well as many artillery pieces and new German machine guns. This could be the first step in a fruitful relationship."
gerfor.48.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.49.t:0 "Our Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.49.d:0 "Unfortunately, with Ireland no longer able or willing to receive our aid the whole programme had to be aborted. Luckily, the equipment and craft already produced remain in our hands and is ready to be used."
gerfor.49.a:0 "Better than nothing."

gerfor.50.t:0 "Peace with [ENG.GetNameDef]?"
gerfor.50.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has negotiated a Second Peace with Honour with [ENG.GetNameDef], since it's clear the [ENG.GetAdjective] have lost their will to carry on the war. This might be a chance for us to end our war with them, as well. Should we take advantage of the opportunity, or continue the battle?"
gerfor.50.a:0 "Let's end this now"
gerfor.50.b:0 "No, we continue the war!"

gerfor.51.t:0 "Germany Requests Austrian Support"
gerfor.51.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, Germany treated us rather shabbily when it came to the Brest-Litovsk divisions, with Poland and Ukraine being forced from our sphere of influence by the glory-hogging Reich. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.51.a:0 "The Kaisers will fight together again!"
gerfor.51.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.51.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.52.t:0 "Germany Requests Ottoman Support"
gerfor.52.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, with the end of the Weltkrieg the Germans refused to assist us in our recovery despite fighting with them virtually unnecessarily, and instead the Reich continued to exploit our serious foreign debt problems. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.52.a:0 "The Sultan shall aid the Reich!"
gerfor.52.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.52.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.53.t:0 "Germany Requests Bulgarian Support"
gerfor.53.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, despite our contributions to the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg being recognised to an extent, Germany seized control of Romania's coveted oil supplies for itself and has neglected us ever since. The question now is whether we should assist the Reich?"
gerfor.53.a:0 "We owe them. It is time to repay the debt!"
gerfor.53.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.53.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.54.t:0 "Austria Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.54.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.54.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.55.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.55.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.55.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.56.t:0 "Bulgaria Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.56.d:0 "Bulgaria listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.56.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.57.t:0 "Austria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.57.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea but pointedly refused to help us in our time of need. We stand alone in our struggle against Syndicalism."
gerfor.57.a:0 "Shameful."

gerfor.58.t:0 "The Ottomans Refused to Help"
gerfor.58.d:0 "Despite all of our exhortations the Sultan refused to support us at all in our fight against the Internationale."
gerfor.58.a:0 "Damn him!"

gerfor.59.t:0 "Bulgaria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.59.d:0 "The Bulgarians ignored our call for support and instead decided to stay out of the crusade against the Syndicalists. It is not like a Balkan country to avoid a fight."
gerfor.59.a:0 "Traitorous curs."

gerfor.60.t:0 "Austria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.60.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help but decided not to join our alliance or begin military operations against the Internationale. Instead they will send supplies and volunteers to help in our struggle against Syndicalism!"

gerfor.61.a:0 "The irony is palpable."

gerfor.62.t:0 "Bulgaria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.62.d:0 "The Bulgarian government did not wish to offer us overt military support, believing that though Syndicalism is a terrible plague, war with the Communards would be pointless. They promised to at least give us some equipment and volunteers."

gerfor.63.t:0 "Germany Requests Trondheim Leasehold"
gerfor.63.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has approached our ambassador with a somewhat strange offer: we have been offered a substantial sum of money if we lease them our harbour of Trondheim for twenty-five years, to allow for the creation of a forward base against the Republican navy of the Union of Britain. The Norwegian inhabitants would be allowed to stay, as would our civilian administration, and the boost to commerce in the region would be immense. However, the Syndicalists might decide to retaliate against us if we agree to the offer...\n\nWhat shall we do?"

gerfor.65.t:0 "Norway does not agree to lease Trondheim"

They have begun talks with the Canadian administration about joining the Entente itself, in an effort to unite all of our efforts against the Syndicalists. The question now is what us French can exact from the Germans, culpable as they are for this entire mess."

Although the people are exhausted from years of war, there still remains a strong pro-German sentiment amongst the ruling class and a desire to stand side by side with the victors of the new order.\n\nNonetheless our empire does not intend to sell its skin cheaply and has demanded that the Caucasus, traditionally part of the Ottoman sphere, be restored to its control and that Azerbaijan becomes more tightly connected to the Sublime Porte. Although angered by our demands, it nonetheless seems like the German government is willing to consider the cost if it leads to the strengthening of their Southern Flank."

gerfor.111.t:0 "Commercial Vessels Refuse to Sail to Venezuela!"
gerfor.111.d:0 "With us being at war we need all of the manpower we can get, and our vital oil supply links with Venezuela have become dependent on civilian ships transporting much of our oil. Unfortunately it is becoming increasingly clear that due to the danger of ships being sunk commercial shippers are becoming reluctant to take the oil, which is causing our oil imports to drop precipitously. Yet again our oil supplies are severely endangered."

gerfor.113.t:0 "German Proposes Trade for Oil"

gerfor.116.d:0 "After the Germans provided us with a lackluster trade deal in exchange for our oil supplies, they have come forward with a new proposal offering military aid to our force so long as we guarantee the oil.

gerfor.119.t:0 "Ensuring the Protection of the Oil Fields"
gerfor.119.d:0 "Russia has been threatening Azerbaijan, which controls the Baku Oil Fields, an region incredibly rich with the so-called black gold. We must ensure that Russia does not take these oil fields, and if possible, secure them for ourselves. We are going to hold a conference in Baku in order to negotiate with Azerbaijan the best way forward, by ensuring the survival of the Azeri state - and more importantly, the oil they hold."

gerfor.120.t:0 "Germany Proposes the Baku Conference"
gerfor.120.d:0 "Germany has come to us with a proposal for a conference in Baku. Us and representatives of the Reich will be the only attendees and we will seek to negotiate the future of our oil fields and ways to ensure that the Russians don't threaten us over them. How should we respond?"

gerfor.120.b:0 "This threatens our sovereignty, refuse."

gerfor.121.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refused to Attend the Conference"

gerfor.122.b:0 "Demand they embargo Russia and give us yearly oil in exchange for a guarantee."
gerfor.122.c:0 "Demand direct control over Azeri oil fields."

gerfor.123.t:0 "Oil for a Guarantee"
gerfor.123.d:0 "The German proposal ended up being suprisingly tame, asking simply for a monthly import of oil in exchange for them guaranteeing our independence, essentially keeping us safe from Russia for as long as this deal lasts. It would be foolish to refuse."
gerfor.123.a:0 "Very reasonable."
gerfor.123.b:0 "We can't give up our oil."

gerfor.124.t:0 "Baku Conference is Successful"
gerfor.124.d:0 "The Azeri government has accepted our gracious offer, guaranteeing us oil for as long as this deal lasts. Assuming that all goes well, the oil shortage is finally over."
gerfor.124.a:0 "The black gold flows again!"

gerfor.125.t:0 "Baku Conference Fails"
gerfor.125.d:0 "The Azerbaijani government has foolishly refused our generous offer, and it seems that the entire conference itself has collapsed. A few diplomats still remain in the building that we could possibly threaten..."
gerfor.125.a:0 "We'll look for oil elsewhere."
gerfor.125.b:0 "Threaten Azerbaijan with war."

gerfor.126.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
gerfor.126.d:0 "Due to our recent refusal of the German deal at the Baku Conference, it seems the German government has threatened us with war if we do not accept their demands. The choice seems clear here, as war with the Kaiserreich would almost certainly mean the end."
gerfor.126.a:0 "We have no choice."
gerfor.126.b:0 "We remain firm on our decision."

gerfor.127.t:0 "Azerbaijan Still Refuses!"
gerfor.127.d:0 "Despite the fact that we, a mighty empire, have threatened tiny Azerbaijan with war, their government has refused to budge on the oil issue. The questions remains, should we act on our threats?"
gerfor.127.a:0 "They asked for this."
gerfor.127.b:0 "We are no warmongerers."

gerfor.128.t:0 "Germany Demands Oil and an Embargo on Russia"
gerfor.128.d:0 "Germany's demands were a bit more radical then expected, with them not only demanding oil but also for us to embargo Russia in order to cut off their oil supplies. While our independence will still be gaurenteed, Russia will bear much more resentment towards us. In the long run this could pose serious risk to our nation."
gerfor.128.a:0 "We'll accept."
gerfor.128.b:0 "We can't embargo Russia, but the oil is fine."
gerfor.128.c:0 "This was a bad idea."

gerfor.129.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts the Oil Treaty"
gerfor.129.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted the entirety of our deal, which promises to starve the Russians of oil and provide us with it. Not only have we strengthened ourselves greatly, we have managed to successfully cripple an enemy in the process."
gerfor.129.a:0 "I almost feel bad for them."

gerfor.130.t:0 "Azerbaijan Changes the Deal"
gerfor.130.d:0 "Azerbaijan has changed the treaty to a much more mild approach, removing the Russian embargo clause so that we only get oil from them. In a negotiation one must always make compromises, but the power disparity between us and the Azeris is massive. Should we accept the clause variation?"
gerfor.130.a:0 "We'll concede on the embargo point."
gerfor.130.b:0 "Take it or leave it."

gerfor.131.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Give Concessions"
gerfor.131.d:0 "Germany has refused our tamer approach at the conference, and stated that the deal will be off if we do not both guarantee oil supplies and embargo the Russians. It seems we can't make them budge on this point, so acceptance may be our only option. The alternative could be catastrophic."
gerfor.131.a:0 "Fine then."
gerfor.131.b:0 "Then the conference will end here."

gerfor.132.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refuses Again"
gerfor.132.d:0 "Azerbaijan has refused our deal yet again, and officially put an end to the Baku Conference. The only option left if we want the oil fields is to threaten them with war. The puny state would be foolish to resist us."
gerfor.132.a:0 "We'll look for oil elsewhere."
gerfor.132.b:0 "Third times a charm. Oil or war!"

gerfor.133.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
gerfor.133.d:0 "Germany, fed up with us refusing not once, but twice, has threatened us with war if their side of the deal is not met. The Reich is seemingly willing to fight us over this issue, so the oil must clearly be worth a lot to them. A war would mean an end to our country, so we may have no choice..."
gerfor.133.a:0 "Give them their damn treaty."
gerfor.133.b:0 "This is ridiculous!"

gerfor.134.t:0 "Germany Demands Direct Control of Our Oil Fields"
gerfor.134.d:0 "The German diplomats have claimed in the conference that the Azeri government and industrial sector is not equipped to properly exploit the oil deposits in the country. They have recommended allowing them to have complete oversight of our industries by placing German directors into key positions in state-owned oil companies, meaning that together we can access even more oil. While we could all get rich off the deal, the problem is that this could possibly threaten our position as an independent nation."
gerfor.134.a:0 "Well alright then..."
gerfor.134.b:0 "Economic influence is enough, we shall have no directors."
gerfor.134.c:0 "Refuse outright."

gerfor.135.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts!"
gerfor.135.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted our recent deal, giving us direct control over their oil fields and industry. This essentially makes them another one of our subjects, securing oil for a very long time."
gerfor.135.a:0 "Let the black gold flow."

gerfor.136.t:0 "Azerbaijan Varies the Treaty"
gerfor.136.d:0 "Azerbaijan has vetoed the idea of us having our directors manage their oil companies, and they only wish to have economic guidance. Our influence over the country and its oil supplies would still be immense, though substantially less than with our German oversight of the oil industry itself."
gerfor.136.a:0 "We'll accept the change."
gerfor.136.b:0 "It's this or nothing!"

gerfor.137.t:0 "Germany Accepts the Modified Treaty"
gerfor.137.d:0 "Germany has accepted our version of the treaty, which help us get more out of our oil fields and whilst also gaining us a guarantee from the Reich. In exchange all we need do is ensure that the oil supply remains unmolested and that the shipments reach Germany."
gerfor.137.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.138.t:0 "Germany Reaffirms the Original Proposal"
gerfor.138.d:0 "The Reich's diplomats have seemingly not budged on their position on having German directors control our oil fields, and this is simply unacceptable for us as it essentially makes us a puppet of Germany. Unfortunately the threat of war is present if we refuse. How do we respond?"
gerfor.138.a:0 "It's this or war."
gerfor.138.b:0 "Maybe the Russians will help?"
gerfor.138.c:0 "We said no the first time, we'll say it again."

gerfor.139.t:0 "Azerbaijan Requests Assistance"
gerfor.139.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Baku Conference between Germany and Azerbaijan over the oil supply, tensions have been heating up. Germany has now formally threatened them with war. Azeri diplomats have sent a telegram asking for our assistance in the matter, and a reward of oil might be in it for us if we help. The question is, should we pressure Germany to back down?"
gerfor.139.a:0 "Send a stern message to Germany."
gerfor.139.b:0 "We won't upset the Germans."

gerfor.140.t:0 "Germany Proposes Research Treaty"
gerfor.140.d:0 "The German government has proposed a military research treaty between our two nations. Though relations between our two nations have not been particularly close for some time, we could benefit greatly from German military assistance."
gerfor.140.a:0 "This sounds like a good idea!"
gerfor.140.b:0 "Bulgaria needs no help."

gerfor.141.t:0 "Bulgaria Accepts the Research Treaty"
gerfor.141.d:0 "Bulgaria has accepted our very generous military research treaty. As our old Central Power ally it is in our best interests that they succeed in Balkan affairs."
gerfor.141.a:0 "Wonderful!"

gerfor.142.t:0 "Bulgaria Refuses the Research Treaty"
gerfor.142.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Bulgarian government has declined our military research treaty, as they see it as 'unnecessary' for their current military plans."
gerfor.142.a:0 "Fine then."

gerfor.143.t:0 "Germany Demands Gibraltar"
gerfor.143.d:0 "The ambassador of Germany has informed us of recent developments in the Reich. As a result of a recent policy change in Berlin their current priority is solidifying their control over the Mediterranean. Already in control of the Suez, they are now demanding that we hand the Rock over to them."
gerfor.143.a:0 "Well, do we even have a choice?"
gerfor.143.b:0 "Refuse this outrageous demand."

gerfor.144.t:0 "Spain Hands Over Gibraltar"
gerfor.144.d:0 "Spain, conscious of the righteousness of our claim on Gibraltar, have decided to give the land to us."
gerfor.144.a:0 "Smart!"

gerfor.145.t:0 "Spain Refused Our Demands"
gerfor.145.d:0 "The Spanish have refused to hand over Gibraltar to us, jeopardising our entire Mediterranean policy."
gerfor.145.a:0 "Fine, but we'll be back."

gerfor.146.t:0 "The Yemen Question"
gerfor.146.d:0 "For a long time, we have wanted to have the Yemeni nation in our sphere of influence so as to safeguard the approaches to the Red Sea and Suez Canal. Now that we have the opportunity to do so, what shall we offer them to incentivise them?"
gerfor.146.a:0 "Offer them our Yemeni colonies!"
gerfor.146.b:0 "Offer them nothing."

gerfor.147.t:0 "Germany Proposes An Alliance!"
gerfor.147.d:0 "The German Ambassador to our nation has offered us the Aden colony for an alliance."

gerfor.148.t:0 "Yemen Accepts"

gerfor.152.a:0 "Fine."

gerfor.156.t:0 "Germany Proposes the Offer Again"
gerfor.156.d:0 "Germany, seemingly unwilling to give up, has offered us to have German advisers have direct control of our oil fields. It seems the tension is at a boiling point, and saying no one more time might lead to war."
gerfor.156.a:0 "We can't fight the Germans."
gerfor.156.c:0 "Once again, we refuse."

gerfor.157.t:0 "Russia Threatens Us"
gerfor.157.d:0 "Apparently, at the instigiation of the Azeri government, Russia has gotten involved in the Baku oil dispute and threatened to go to war with us if we enter Azerbaijan's borders. A war with the Russians would be bloody and, while valuable, the Baku oil fields are probably not worth losing a million German men over."
gerfor.157.a:0 "Call their bluff."
gerfor.157.b:0 "Back down."

gerfor.158.t:0 "Germany Enters Azerbaijan!"
gerfor.158.d:0 "Despite our recent threats, it seems that the Germans think we were bluffing about a potential declaration of war and have entered Azerbaijan anyways. Whether we were actually bluffing is yet to be decided..."
gerfor.158.a:0 "They won't get away with this."
gerfor.158.b:0 "We can't risk war."

gerfor.159.t:0 "Russia Assists us!"

gerfor.161.t:0 "Azerbaijan Declines Again"
gerfor.161.d:0 "It seems Azerbaijan still fails to recognise our military prowess, since yet again they have declined our offer. It is time to meet them with German arms and seize the oil fields for ourselves!"

gerfor.164.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
gerfor.164.d:0 "Due to our denial of the German diplomats, they have gone to the extremes and threatened us with war if their demands are not met. Our small country cannot withstand German military might, so refusal would be foolish."

gerfor.166.d:0 "Because of our allowance to let the Germans establish direct control over our industry, we should have expected foreign influence to creep in. The government and industry are now riddled with Germans and Azerbaijan is now under de facto German control.

gerfor.190.d:0 "Russia has been unified under the sheer might and awe-inspiring power of the Kaiserreich’s military. With the largest nation on the planet subjugated by the greatest military power on Earth, we could have easily bent the nation to our own desires and oppressed the local Russian people without obstruction or reproach, but instead we graciously decided to bring civilization to this savage, frozen wasteland. As our war machine tore through the nation, in its wake we planted the seeds of Prussian Constitutionalism - the noblest form of government in existence as exemplified by the glorious Kaiserreich. Our efforts have now paid off, for our collaborative government has finally begun to pay dividends, stabilizing the bulk of the Russian heartland under its rule and paving the way for an able administration to take the reins of the Russian people’s destiny. \n\nHowever, now we must decide what form of government this new puppet-state shall be. Russia has a long and storied history of monarchism, so much so that autocratic rule comes naturally to them. Keeping in line with Berlin, we could fill the Russian throne with true noble blood. The prime candidate is Prince Louis Ferdinand von Preussen, both a Hohenzollern by blood and Romanov by marriage, being Wilhelm III’s son and married to Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna who herself is daughter of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich - cousin to Tsar Nicholas II and grandson of Tsar Alexander II. However, if we were to choose this young Prussian Prince, we would likely face great backlash from the Russian populace. With that in mind, perhaps it would be more wise to let the Russian people decide their own fate under the Hegemony of the Kaiserreich."

gerfor.200.d:0 "With the dominance of Berlin over the Reichspakt and wider Europe secured and with the radical barbarians that banged at our gates finally defeated on the righteous fields of combat, the Kaiserreich stands supreme as the hegemon of Europe as back to back victors of two world wars that has solidified our God-blessed empire as the true guardians of Western Civilization and the unmistakable, unmatchable global superpower, at least for now, and we aim to keep it that way. However, we are not alone on this newly-secured continent, for our old allies and bickering brother to the South in Vienna have managed to survive as well, and now we must decide on what to do with them. \n\nAlthough we were allies in the Great War, we have since fallen out of favor with one another despite our occasional cooperation, but many still call for our unification like it was the time of the Kleindeutschlanders and Großdeutschlanders all over again, and perhaps there is some stock in their desires. Put on the shelf as it became clear that another world war was beginning to rear its ugly head once more, the ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit plan would have the Kaisers in Vienna and Berlin come together to meet as equals in order to discuss the future of Europe and the Pan-European and Pan-German questions once and for all. Perhaps, in this new age of European peace, it is time to once again pursue these plans?"
gerfor.200.a:0 "Send a delegation to Vienna. We begin the push for Pan-Germany once more!"
gerfor.200.b:0 "Leave them be. The Austrians have their own issues we would rather not deal with."

gerfor.201.t:0 "Berlin Proposes the Kaisergipfel"
gerfor.201.d:0 "In a surprising turn of events following this post-war lul we have begun to experience since the fall of the radicals to the East and West, we have received word from the Kaiser in Berlin that he wishes to speak to our own Kaiser, one on one, in order to determine the future fate of Europe, as well as to bring to table a number of rising questions about Pan-Germanism and Pan-Europeanism - either through direct unification or close cooperation - so that we can put the German Question to rest once and for all. Delighting many Pan-European theorists throughout the Empire like Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi and Milan Hodža, as well as many Pan-Germans like Karl Hermann Wolf and George Ritter von Schönerer, and the German Bohemians under Konrad Henlein, to name a few, this idea of a ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit could be promising, but could also spell the end of Austrian independence as well as we potentially unify with Berlin. What shall we do?"
gerfor.201.a:0 "Austria marches on her own. Tell our northern brothers no."
gerfor.201.b:0 "To Berlin! This ‘Kaiser Summit’ shall be held at once!"

gerfor.202.t:0 "Vienna Ignores Our Call"
gerfor.202.d:0 "In a saddening yet none too surprising turn of events, Austria has denied our calls for the Kaisergipfel, instead wishing to walk their own path. With our southern brothers turning their back on us once again, we are left with two options. We can either turn our backs as well and walk towards our own future alone, or we could prepare for war once more in order to settle the German Question once and for all - what shall we do?"
gerfor.202.a:0 "We shall walk our own path. Ignore the Austrians."

gerfor.203.t:0 "The Summit of Kaisers"
gerfor.203.d:0 "With Austria agreeing to our call for a summit between the Kaisers, we have been hard at work these past few weeks preparing for the meeting, and finally the long-awaited day has finally arrived. Deep within the vaulted, ornately decorated halls of the Königliches Schloss on Spree Island in the heart of Berlin, on grounds guarded by more soldiers loyal to either Kaiser than any one person would normally see off the battlefield, the Kaiser Summit was held at long last. What was said behind those closed doors will likely never be truly known, but the outcome of which will reverberate through time immemorial regardless of the outcome as the future of an entire continent, and the entire Western World along with it, hangs in the balance. As the Kaiser in Berlin tried to convince the Kaiser in Austria to be a secondary monarch among many within a unified Pan-European system under the German crown, or perhaps a dual crown shared equally by both monarchs, the Austrian Kaiser nearly left multiple times, but yet the summit lasted, at least for awhile, as two of the most powerful men on the face of planet hashed it out for the good of Europe. With the Summit going on for hours at first that soon turned into days, a final decision needed to be made soon, and so what shall be the outcome of the Kaisergipfel as the fate of the continent hangs in the balance?"

gerfor.204.t:0 "The Dream of Paneuropa"
gerfor.204.d:0 "With the Kaiser in Vienna and his Austro-Hungarian subjects dealt with one way or another, the time has come for the second phase of the true Kaisergipfel plan. Though the first phase focused on our relationship with our southern Catholic brothers, the second phase deals with the rest of the continent at large as we shift our focus from a Pan-Germanic direction towards the realization of the Pan-European idyll. Should the Kaiserreich continue to exert its influence beyond the Germanic lands of Central Europe, across the cradle of Western Civilization until all of Europe from Iberia to the Urals is united so that we can build our unified, syncretic culture that truly is the height of human perfection on the face of the earth, and if so how should we approach this noble goal, or should we ignore these misplace and naive fantasies in order to focus on building our Pan-Germanic paradise while strengthening the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa without advancing them to their natural Pan-European conclusions?"
gerfor.204.a:0 "We have the real prize. Forget Pan-European dreams."
gerfor.204.b:0 "Push for a decentralized Pan-European alliance."
gerfor.204.c:0 "Realize the Pan-European Dream by force!"

gerfor.205.t:0 "The Face of the New Empire"
gerfor.205.d:0 "As the Kaiserreich swells and evolves into this new pan-national apparatus, we must decide upon the face of this new and experimental state. Should the German Kaiser continue to rule alone as the sovereign monarch of this great land with the rest of the Pan-European royalty and nobility beneath him, or at best serving as gimped equals, or should the Kaiser of Berlin and Kaiser of Austria truly rule together as equals as was suggested by the Viennese delegation during the Kaisergipfel? Perhaps we could even create a pan-national congress to rule behind the Kaiser in Berlin in order to breed a wider sense of equality and cooperation between our constituent peoples - what shall we decide?"
gerfor.205.a:0 "The Kaiser in Berlin started this dream alone and he shall finish it alone!"

gerfor.206.d:0 "Now that we have decided to fully pursue the dream of Pan-European unity. We must encapsulate the spirit of the Pan-European Idyll, and through that there are two flags that are presented, both of which depict twelve stars describing perfection under a blue background ignited by the might of the Kaiserreich, though the variation starts at how the description is illustrated. Nevertheless, what flag shall we choose?"
gerfor.206.a:0 "Go with the first design!"
gerfor.206.b:0 "The second design looks best."

gerfor.207.t:0 "Federating the Kaiser’s Reich"
gerfor.207.d:0 "Taking inspiration from the failed British plan to federalize their dead empire into a united entity, many loyal servants of the Kaiserreich including many old advocates for a more standard Pan-German and Pan-European international conglomeration have instead begun to push for a sort of German ‘imperial federation’ as some sort of evolution of Mitteleuropa and the Reichspakt. Seeking to further Germanic settlement across the scattered lands of the Kaiserreich while simultaneously drawing our colonies and puppets closer to Berlin to the point of inseparability, these internationalists - calling themselves imperial globalists and other similar terms to distinguish themselves from the foul Trotskyite menace that is Leftist Internationalism - push for the total national unification of the entire German Empire, and have gone to great lengths to convince the Kaiser and His Highness’ government of the merits of their ambition. Shall we listen to these unificationists and push towards the complete federalization of the Kaiserreich and her colonies, or should we continue on our way of traditional imperialism as we always have?"
gerfor.207.a:0 "We have no need for such lofty, naive aspirations."
gerfor.207.b:0 "We shall unify the Kaiserriech by force!"

gerfor.208.t:0 "The Flag of Our Greater Kaiserreich."
gerfor.208.d:0 "Now that we have decided to fully take control of the lands within the German Population, we must encapsulate the true spirit of Germania, and through that, the may question lies on our current banner.  Though the prospect of a flag change would be deemed unnecessary, perhaps it is appropriate for us to change our flag fit within a united German identity. Nonetheless, what shall we do with our current flag?"
gerfor.208.a:0 "There is no need for change."
gerfor.208.b:0 "We shall raise a new flag!"

gerfor.209.t:0 "The Flag of Our Kaiserliche Föderation."
gerfor.209.d:0 "Now that we have decided to fully take control of the lands within our vast Empire, we must encapsulate the true spirit of the Föderation, and through that, there are flags proposed to further encapsulate the Kaiserliche spirit. The first design proposed illustrates the current flag, though modified to fit with the current banner, the second one would prove to be a more distinct version, capturing the essence of a more Global Kaiserreich of ours. Which design shall we choose?"
gerfor.209.a:0 "Go with the first design!"

Now their wishes have finally come true, as a state of war now exists between our glorious Vaterland and the nest of vipers to our west. Kaiser Wilhelm II explained the reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France in a special radio address, and called for eradication of final obstacle to achieving "A Place in the Sun". Subsequently thousands of young Germans rushed to enlist in the military, following the example of the Kaiser's grandsons, and civilians began gathering on the streets publicly displaying their support for the war. Despite enduring catastrophic crises, the German nation is united once again. Long live Germany! Long live the Kaiser!"

The paper reported that two daughters of Freiherr Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, a leading general and friend of influential Reichskriegsminister von Schleicher, were involved in shady dealings with Syndicalist-aligned intelligence agencies. Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the War Secretary was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While General von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughters' doings, the real question for von Schleicher is - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - replace him with whom?"

gerfla.1.d:0 "After the Franco-German war of 1870-1871, the Sedantag was established to celebrate our victory at Sedan, where we captured the last French Emperor Napoleon III and the cream of their army. Originally a holiday to honour the Prussian military, the Sedantag transformed into a celebration of the Reich's foundation, and after the Weltkrieg the humbling of its foes.\n\nIn every town and village from Aachen to Memel, every street is decorated in black, white, and red. Every bell proudly proclaims this day of celebration. Nobles, soldiers and innumerable veterans parade proudly through the streets, cheered by the happy masses. Indeed, this is a good day, a day that reminds us of the peace and prosperity we have enjoyed since the forging of the Reich."

Today, Fraulein Hoffmann has accomplished a new long distance record in her customised Fokker F-IX. Starting in Tahiti 36 hours ago, Fraulein Hoffmann today landed safely in Lae on German Neuguinea, where she was welcomed by a jubilant crowd and local governor Albert Hahl.\n\nIt has been rumoured that Hoffmann will soon attempt a solo flight around the world.

gerfla.6.t:0 "Erich von Ludendorff Dies"
gerfla.6.d:0 "Even after his death was reported early this morning, Erich von Ludendorff remains one of the most controversial people in recent German history. On the one hand he was a hero of the Weltkrieg, the orchestrator of German victory in the 1919 fall of France. On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten the ensuing military dictatorship that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924. Although Ludendorff still received some honours for his service, like his knighthood, the former quartermaster-general mostly led a secluded life at his estate afterwards."

gerfla.7.t:0 "Georg Michaelis Dies"
gerfla.7.d:0 "The former Reichskanzler Georg Michaelis died today at the age of 78. Succeeding von Bethmann-Hollweg as Imperial Chancellor in 1917, the first and until now the only commoner to have acceded to the post of German chancellor, he was considered by many as the stooge of the Hindenburg-Ludendorff dictatorship, being forced to resign and replaced by Hindenburg after Ludendorff grew dissatisfied with him in 1919. As a former Reichskanzler, he received a state funeral, but the Kaiser pointedly refused to attend."
gerfla.7.a:0 "He was a commoner and a stooge, but a Chancellor above all."

gerfla.8.t:0 "Tenth Anniversary of von Tirpitz' death"
gerfla.8.d:0 "Today marks the tenth anniversary of the death of the Great Chancellor and Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz. As the eight Chancellor and Commander of the German Navy Tirpitz led the Kaiserreich out of the Ludendorff dictatorship, initiating the Golden Age that lasted through the Twenties until his death.\n\nAfter his death, his Deutsche Vaterlandspartei (German Fatherland party, DVLP), reformed into the Junker party it is today under their new leader, Alfred Hugenberg, opening the way for von Papen's Deutschkonservative Partei, or DkP. While the Reich enjoyed prosperity under Tirpitz's reign, he also continued to hold off on fulfilling the Kaiser's Easter Promises made in 1917, leaving us with political tensions brewing in recent years.\n\nStill, his prestige is enormous, and the anniversary of his death has been accompanied by public demonstrations of respect all over the Empire."

gerfla.13.d:0 "As part of the recent efforts by the SPD to rehabilitate Marx as a true German hero, Kaiser [GER.GetLeader] himself has lent his presence to unveil a new statue of Karl Marx in his hometown of Trier. As part of his dedication speech, the Kaiser has pledged to embark on a new information campaign to remind the German people that Marx was no Syndicalist, merely a social democrat who believed in change through the existing capitalist system, a message that in time would hopefully make its way to the dirty Syndicalists in the West."

gerfla.14.t:0 "Irish Immigrants arrive in Hamburg"
gerfla.14.d:0 "After a short yet perilous trek from Dublin to Hamburg, the first boat of Irish migrants has traversed past the numerous Communard patrols in the North Sea and found their way to our shores. As part of the FVP's new Mitteleuropa immigration program, the majority of people aboard the vessel were skilled laborers, possessing skills that they had acquired over a very long career. While there is no shortage of skilled labor in the Kaiserreich, there is optimism that this cultural and laboral diffusion will lead to closer relations between our two states. Their arrival was unremarkable, with the delegation quickly being interrupted by a minor group of conservatives, displeased with the arrival of Irish Catholics. However, we are confident that the Bavarians in our delegation helped our guests to disregard the outburst and feel more welcome in their new home, due to their shared Catholic heritage."

While returning from one of his many visits to Daressalam, this time two additional figures followed Chancellor Vorbeck off the plane in addition to his usual delegation. Upon further investigation, the throngs of German press determined the two mysterious figures were none other than Vorbeck's nephew Albert, an up-and-coming officer in the Mittelafrikan army, as well as Nordrhodesien general Julian Scherner, a longtime confidant of the Chancellor's. This was confirmed later in the day when Vorbeck officially named them as generals in the Imperial German Army. While some political pundits are accusing Paul of nepotism for promoting his nephew, it's no secret that both men were inspired by the renewed patriotism of Vorbeck's Germany and both want to take the fight directly to the despicable Communards."

gerfla.16.d:0 "In front of 64,000 raucous fans at Berlin's Deutsches Stadion, the top football clubs in Germany are meeting for the very first time what looks to be a heated match between up-and-coming side FC Bayern Munich and local favorite Hertha BSC. As part of the DkP's ongoing cultural centralization efforts, the best professional teams from all across the German Empire will compete in a single Reichsliga in a system that until now has been dominated by powerful regional federations of amateur sides, with maybe one or two dominant sides per region, predictably leading to lopsided results. While Hertha isn't expected to win the league, supporters have still come to the stadium in droves as most of them had never seen top competition before. The Kaiser himself is at the match, and while still dressed in his traditional military uniform, the press note that hints of Hertha's blue and white can be seen."

Named the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, or Dragon, these unique aerial vehicles are capable of vertical take-off and landing, making them perfect for use in rough terrain. Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to send a few models to the major colonies and constituent members of the Reichspakt, allowing our armies and the armies of our subjects to utilize this unique technology. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, rotabuggies, and other novel transports devised by crack German scientists and our allied lackeys, we shall be able to ferry our populace, our goods, and our troops all around the Kaiserreich without issue or delay while also delivering devastating payloads at a moment’s notice. Just be careful not to crash any, for we only have a fragile few, and they are currently very temperamental and very hard to replace."

gerfla.18.d:0 "Seeking to put their recent technological breakthroughs to the test, Berlin has been gracious enough to send some of their new military hardware to be tested on the frontlines here at the fringes of Germany’s sphere. The centerpiece invention of these new shipments are the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, or Dragon. These ‘Dragons’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these ‘Dragons’ have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Germans sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of the Kaiserirech and the wider Reichspakt."

gerfla.19.t:0 "The Bauhaus Question"
gerfla.19.d:0 "Founded by Berlin-born artist Walter Gropius in the years following our victory in the Great War, the Staatliches Bauhaus is one of the Kaiserreich’s most famous, or infamous, art schools that first opened its doors in 1919 after working within the Deutscher Werkbund art union founded by Hermann Muthesius in 1907. Aimed at the creation of a Gesamtkunstwerk, or a comprehensive artwork in which all the different mediums of art in all its forms would be brought together in order to feed each other in a new, comprehensive artistic revolution based on non-Leftist Internationalism, anti-Expressionism, New Objectivity/New Sobriety (called Neues Bauen or Neue Saclichkeit in German), and new concepts of liberal German Modernism and the avant-garde. With three campuses now existing in Berlin, Dessau, and Weimar as the movement explodes in popularity, the Bauhaus group has largely been dominated by rival architect-directors Walter Gropius, Hannes Meyer, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, along with famous artists like Paul Klee, Wassily Kandisnky, László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Schlemmer, Ernst May, Martin Wagner, Bruno Taut, Bruno Paul, Erich Mendelsohn, Hans Poelzig, Adolf Meyer, Peter Behrens, Joost Schmidt, and more, all dedicated to the creation of rational, functional, and non-fanciful art that flies in the face of the baroque, imposing classic architecture traditional throughout the Kaiserreich and the rising Völkisch movements that resist the march of progress. \n\nDespite their growing popularity, and their sole focus on art and nothing else like their famous new fonts and futurist art dedicate to the adaptation of German architecture towards something that fits ‘our world of machines, radios, and fast cars’, the Bauhaus group have been accused of harboring radically liberal or Leftist sentiments, holding traitorous ties to the Russian constructivist Vkhutemas art school, and harboring anti-monarchist sentiments, though none of these claims have been verified, likely just being hearsay spread by Bauhaus’ detractors. Regardless, this has not stopped many reactionary groups from going after the Left-ish artist guild while supporting rival art movements and typefaces like the dated Fraktur style and its rivalry with the Antiqua and Textura movements, or more modern attempts at a medieval-esque styles like Fraktur's proposed replacements of Kurrentschrift or Sütterlin, forcing our administration’s hand and leaving the decision of what to do with these artists up to the Crown. So what shall we do?"
gerfla.19.a:0 "Fund the Bauhaus group as an exemplar of German cultural innovation!"
gerfla.19.b:0 "Leave them to their art in peace."
gerfla.19.c:0 "Shut down this degenerate hive of liberal excess!"

germit.1.d.independent:0 "In light of the consequences of Black Monday, the German government has come up with a new proposal to rejuvenate the continental economy. In order to meaningfully increase and simplify commerce and trade across the Reichspakt, they propose that the German currency, the Mark, should become the accepted currency in all Mitteleuropa, renamed formally to the 'Europamark'. This proposal is modelled somewhat after the Zollverein agreements between German states in the 19th century, which, among other things, established a standardized system of currency exchange pegged to the Prussian mark - although its reach and ambition is far greater.\n\nIn many of Germany's 'subject partner' states, the currencies are tied to the Mark already, so the actual impact would be relatively minimal. How should we respond to this proposal?"

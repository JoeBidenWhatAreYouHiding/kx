POLITICS_WILHELM_II_DESC:0 "Born 27 January 1859, Friedrich Wilhelm Viktor Albert ascended the throne upon the death of his father, Frederick III, in June of 1888. He quickly oriented the German Empire into new belligerence, starting with the dismissal of Otto von Bismarck. With a renewed interest in expansionism the German Colonial Empire grew larger, and the Ruhr steadily became the manufacturing hegemon of Europe. His relentless ambition, however, had easily led Germany into conflicts with its neighbors, including a naval arms race with the United Kingdom and foreign policy that ultimately isolated Germany from most of the great powers.\n\nThis situation, resulting in Germany having to carry the burden of "weaker" allies, was what it had to contend with during the Weltkrieg. Yet Wilhelm remained steadfast throughout the conflict, having asserted himself many times against both the military and civilian leadership and refusing to accept a peace that wouldn't bring Germany glory. Shockingly, he also practiced caution when his generals advocated reckless aggression. The pivotal moment came with the Kaiser's silent approval of the Hindenburg-Ludendorff Dictatorship, the result of which would not only irrevocably change German politics but also finally bring the Weltkrieg to a victorious end.\n\nYet the Ludendorff Dictatorship would slowly chafe upon Wilhelm II, likely due to his lack of personal control over the aging general. Once Ludendorff's intrigues had failed, his friendship with Hugenberg evaporating, and he lost the favor of the Kaiser, Wilhelm found it easy to force the dictator's resignation and bring in his personal ally Alfred von Tirpitz. Tirpitz's chancellorship was far more amenable, and the 'Golden Years' of Tirpitz's rule made the Kaiser generally confident that his fatherland could now run itself, so long as he maintained a guiding hand.\n\nHis domain over the Kaiserreich has now stretched to nearly 50 years, longer than even the old Kings of Prussia, and he watches with both pride and caution over his fiefdom. Having seen the revolutions which shook many European nations erase relatives and rivals alike, Wilhelm now sits as one of the last symbols of the old order on the Continent, surrounded by hungry rivals. The worsening situation has led the concerned Kaiser to wonder if it would be wise to step into politics once more and ensure his crown is not torn asunder..."
POLITICS_WILLY_3_DESC:0 "Born 6 May 1882, Friedich Wilhelm Victor August Ernst, eldest child of Kaiser Wilhelm II, has now ascended to the throne as Kaiser Wilhelm III. While Prince Wilhelm has been known for a lot of things, from his love of association football to his fondness for Tudor architecture, his most headline-making of traits would be his intensive support for his father's Weltpolitik. Wilhelm III had long held a predilection for German expansionism, immediately seeking a generalship upon the commencement of the Weltkrieg. While his initial failings in starting the Verdun Offensive had caused many generals to reassess the role of the nobility in the military, his close coordination with Kurt von Schleicher and better showing during the Kaiserschlacht had been what the Kronprinz needed to return to Berlin as a hero to his people. Basking in the glory of the Adler's capture of the mantle of world power imbued the future Kaiser with an insatiable hunger.\n\nIn the post-Weltkrieg world, Wilhelm III would utilize his relationship with Kurt von Schleicher to remain politically relevant, promoting his ideology of hierarchy during the November Uprisings and eagerly casting doubt upon the generals who once criticized him when time came for the Ludendorff Dictatorship to fall. While he has been able to gain popularity due to his messages against the likes of Hindenburg, his repeated visits to numerous paramilitary organizations had definitively harmed his reputation among many Germans. The most furious of onlookers had come to be Wilhelm III's own father, who, over time, had to persistently forbid his son from making obvious political sympathies public.\n\nYet as Wilhelm III now sits upon the throne of the Kaiserreich, commanding its prestigious armies and its ocean-going navy, none can know what the war hound may desire. From an enhancement of German power to simple maintenance of the present Weltreich, the possibilities now stand endless before the new head of the House Hohenzollern."

Commissioned as an infantry officer, he made a good impression on his superiors for outstanding ability and so began to climb the ranks. At the beginning of the Weltkrieg, he was the 22nd Division's Chief of Staff - throughout the course of the war, he saw little action, mostly serving in various staff positions, but with a high reputation among his peers.\n\nAfter the war, he used this good impression and connections to climb the ranks again, ultimately reaching the rank of Generaloberst. A competent and experienced commander respected by pretty much everyone in the General Staff, von Rundstedt is also perhaps the most apolitical - no matter what the topic or issue may be, his view is that the Army must stay out of any political affairs. After all, Prussian field marshals never mutiny.§!"

Trained as an infantry officer in the Bavarian Army, he eventually rose to command the Bavarian I Army Corps, all while travelling extensively, taking up carpentry, and fulfilling his duties as a prince of the Bavarian royal family. In 1913, he became the heir apparent of the Kingdom, and a year later, he was assigned to lead the German Sixth Army during the Schlieffen Plan. Though his assignment was made due to his royal status, he proved to be an able and innovative commander. At the same time, however, he used his military command to push for Bavarian interests - refusing to withdraw his army from the Western Front to defend Prussia and thus forcing the General Staff to move troops from Belgium instead.\n\nIn July 1916, he was promoted to Generalfeldmarschall and was assigned to command the Army Group Rupprecht, a rank he has held onto until today. In 1921, after the passing of his father, Ludwig III of Bavaria, Rupprecht was crowned as the new King of Bavaria, and since then reigns as a constitutional monarch with respect for the laws and institutions of his homeland. Though having to occupy two chairs at once may seem exhausting for some, the King seems none worse for wear, and dutifully awaits Germany's next great war.§!"

His father, an agricultural administrator, hoped for his son to follow the same career path, but he instead volunteered for the Prussian army and served with distinction in the Franco-Prussian War. In the years following the war, Mackensen broke expectations one after the other, bypassing the three-year preparation period for the General Staff and later serving as an adjutant to Wilhelm II himself, the first commoner to do so. On the Kaiser's 40th birthday, he was ennobled, becoming August von Mackensen, and was assigned to command XVII Army Corps - a prestigious position, as Crown Prince Wilhelm now served under him.\n\nDuring the Weltkrieg, he was one of Germany's most successful and prestigious commanders, assigned to front after front in Europe - Galicia, Serbia, and finally Romania, shattering Entente resistance in all three campaigns. He returned to Germany a war hero and a Generalfeldmarschall, and continued to serve in the Army thenceforth. By now, however, von Mackensen is over eighty years old, his sharpness has dulled and his body is no longer as able as it once was - most assume retirement is coming soon, the only thing that matters is when.§!"

A modern royal well-liked within German society, a competent equestrian and a student of administrative law, he began his career in the army in 1911, commissioned to command the 1st Life Hussar Regiment. When the Weltkrieg began, he rose to command the 5th Army, and then the Army Group Kronprinz Wilhelm, despite his young age and lack of military experience. His influence in decision-making on the front was minimal, however, and Wilhelm instead used the prestige of his position to support Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff - he described the ousting of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg as "the most beautiful day of his life".\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm returned from the Western Front a war hero, and continued his duties as the heir apparent. In the post-war years, he has retained his position in the Army, while growing increasingly close with the German right wing - especially Kurt von Schleicher, who is a friend and ally of Wilhelm's.§!"

Much like the rest of his extended family, he followed a career in the military. After six years in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment - and reached the Weltkrieg as an infanrtry lieutenant enrolled in the Prussian War Academy. The war put an end to his studies and sent him to the front - both East and West, in several front and several world-renown campaigns, ending with the victorious march into France in 1919.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Manstein remained in the army and continued climbing the ranks, having shown his talent and intelligence in the years prior. As a newly inducted member of the General Staff, he toured countries across Europe to study their military facilities and breakthroughs in new tactics, while additionally putting special attention upon the reformations of the Polish military, all while developing his own. Regarded as an innovative commander with a knack for unorthodox strategies, he is one of the main proponents of combined arms, mobile warfare in the German army.§!"

After his time in the cadet corps in Plön and Groß-Lichterfelde, he was commissioned into the Third Foot Guards Regiment. It was here that he first met the future politician and one of the most influential men in Germany, Kurt von Schleicher. They formed a lifelong friendship and supported each other in their careers from then on out.\n\nHammerstein-Equord served as a staff officer during the Weltkrieg and continued rising in rank after its conclusion. In the divided Deutsches Heer, he was a supporter of von Seeckt's reforms, which would transform the army into a smaller, yet more professional force that would adapt all of the newest principles of war. Schleicher tactically backed this faction, at least for a while, and after he became the Prussian Minister of War, he pushed his lifelong friend into the highest office of the OHL, consolidating his power over the Army and giving him a powerful base for his political ambitions. Yet, Hammerstein is not a complete puppet, and holds at least some political acumen.§!"

He would have little chance to use his decades of experience on the frontline though, as he was soon selected to staff duties shortly after the outbreak of the war. Though hesitant to leave his position as a battery commander behind, he nevertheless approached his new position with vigour and natural skill, eventually rising to the position as chief of staff to Paul von Hindenburg by the end of the war.\n\nImpressed by the scientific advances made in warfare during the Weltkrieg, von Vollard-Bockelberg would use his position on the general staff to foster close connections with the armaments industry and lead to his appointment to the newly established Army Weapons Office (Heereswaffenamt). Through his business connections and diligent work he would eventually rise to lead the HWA and is spending the majority of his time coordinating military production with the extensive German armaments industry.§!"

Widely recognised as one of the best young German generals, with the right combination of skill and political backing, Model stands ready to serve in whatever capacity is needed by the Kaiserreich. Ideologically, he is close to the political right.§!"

Though clashing with von Schleicher politically, von Blomberg is nonetheless a supporter of his ideas on mobilising the entire German state behind the army, possibly even going so far as declaring a National Defence State (Wehrstaat) to take full advantage of authoritarianism to grow Germany's military power.§!"

Serving as chief of staff of the 236th Division, he was seriously wounded in 1918 and sat out the remainder of the war in a hospital bed. The injury didn't hold back Clever Hans, and he continued limited staff work whilst recovering, much to the admiration of his superiors.\n\nDeviating from his beginnings as an infantry officer, von Kluge has shown great interest in the development of armoured units and their possible use in avoiding the bogged down trench warfare known from the western front. Nominally apolitical, von Kluge is privately critical of the authoritarian and militarist tendencies of many of his fellow generals and hopes that a superior German army will be used as a deterrence against a new Weltkrieg.§!"

A devout Catholic and believer in the traditional structure of the German Empire, von Leeb has found little in common with the likes of von Schleicher and von Hammerstein-Equord.

Moving from a position as adjutant in the Bavarian Foot Artillery Brigade to various divisional and corps staff appointments, Kesselring would continue to observe and expand on his knowledge on the use of aircraft in support of ground forces.\n\nMoving to the infantry branch following the conclusion of the war, Kesselring toyed with the idea of transferring to the nascent Luftstreitkräfte but decided to remain with the army for the better opportunities for advancement in the Bavarian Army.

Other than his impressive service record in various staff positions, Haase also served on the Armistice Commission in 1919, as well as being present as one of a multitude of military advisors at the Versailles Peace Conference.\n\nFollowing the end of the peace conference, Haase returned to Württemberg where he took up a position in the Main Office of the War Ministry, his political experience at the Armistice Commission and Peace Conference serving him well during the demobilisation and reorientation of military resources following the end of hostilities.

Rising the ranks of the Guard Corps, von Reichenau transferred to the General Staff in 1915, and served in various divisional staff roles.\n\nAt the end of the war, von Reichenau served with Werner Blomberg and became an ardent supporter of his ideas of the National Defense State (Wehrstaat) as well as more indirectly a supporter of Kurt von Schleicher. Following the appointment of Schleicher to the Prussian War Ministry, von Reichenau was pulled to the ministry where he engaged himself in developing courses in physical education for German recruits. Himself an avid athlete, in both skiing, football, track running and tennis, von Reichenau sees sports as a means to an end.

Starting as an adjutant in the 19th Reserve Infantry Brigade, von Witzleben was promoted captain in October 1914 and took over an infantry company in the 6th Reserve Infantry Regiment. He later rose to command a battalion through battles near Verdun, in Champagne and in Flanders. Heavily wounded in 1918, von Witzleben attended general staff training at the end of 1918, returning to the front as chief of staff of the 121st Infantry Division shortly before the end of the war.\n\nRecognised for his excellent administrative and planning skills, Witzleben remained as a staffer for the next decade, only recently receiving his promotion to General of Infantry. Opposed to the radicalisation of the army and its traditional support base in Germany, von Witzleben sees political struggle between the left and right-wing of German politics as a threat to the stability that the Kaiserreich brings.§!"

Perhaps an obvious example of well-connected Prussian officers promoted prematurely, the relatively young Balck makes up for it in hard work, and it is not only his father's friends at the General Staff who are following his career with great interest.§!"

By 1913 he had been appointed to the German General Staff's railway department per his own request, and it was in this capacity where he became the protégé of Wilhelm Groener. From this position, he had shown a remarkable acumen for organization and a mind for the political, his denunciation of "war profiteering" bringing scandal to his name during the Battle of Verdun. His one and only front-line position during the Weltkrieg would be during the Kerensky Offensive, where he coordinated defenses and counter-attacks in equal measure.\n\nHis Weltkrieg experiences had taught him the value of balancing caution with boldness, as well as the importance of logistical efficiency, and so, despite his perceived alliance to the forming OHL "dictatorship", Schleicher snubbed Ludendorff early by not supporting interventionist maneuvers against the syndicalists in France. He steadily began to form a clique of officers around himself, away from Ludendorff, and his autocratic methods alongside a special attention towards the troops easily set him as the Kaiser's favorite when Ludendorff had fell. Schleicher easily gained not only a higher position in the General Staff, yet also the personal approval and friendship of Crownprince Wilhelm for his patriotism and dedication to the monarchy. Since his ascension, Schleicher has shown an interest in army intelligence departments and a revitalization of military supply methods, and his hunger for more political power has only increased as his clique has grown in number.§!"

GER_totalist_party:0 "Spartakus, BdF"
GER_totalist_party_long:0 "Spartakus, Bund der Frontkämpfer\n§LSpartacus, League of Front-Line Fighters§!\n§gThe Spartacus League, once the largest association of leftists that Germany had ever seen and wielding enough power to threaten the government itself, now can only limp on as the far smaller BdF (League of Front-Line Fighters). The BdF was properly formed in 1919 in the aftermath of the November Uprisings by Heinrich Laufenberg alongside the disparate other survivors, with the rest of the Spartacists finding themselves dead or forced to live far beyond the borders of the German Empire. Laufenberg's leadership has seen the remnant group shift even further into far-leftism, now regarding the democratic socialism as promised by the USPD as being a dead end for revolutionary action, and so now the BdF finds itself in the same ranks as the Jacobins of France or the Maximists of Britain. The BdF itself stresses the importance of cooperation with these other far-left entities in order to complete the transformation of the German Empire into a communist society, and it also is known to cooperate with various other underground organizations within Germany itself. As wide of a faction as it is it still stresses the importance of Anti-imperialism, Marxism, and now National Bolshevism in the interest of the German proletariat.§!"
GER_syndicalist_party:0 "FAUD"
GER_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands\n§LFree Workers' Union of Germany§!\n§gThe FAUD is an anarcho-syndicalist trade union that enjoys the privilege of existence in the face of shutdown from the central government, despite its role within the November Uprisings. Either due to its size, its resentment towards the far-left, or the lack of direct action from its leader, Rudolf Rocker, the FAUD was mostly untouched and continues to organize workers predominantly in the Ruhr valley and various other industrial centers of the German Empire. This de jure lack of a crakdown however came with censure within newspapers and a ban on mass organization, and often politicians that find themselves openly aligned with the FAUD are pushed out of their parties in favor of other candidates. Regardless, despite these troubles, the FAUD has remained committed to the anarcho part of its platform, expressly due to the intellectual interests of Rocker himself, and so the FAUD tends to fail as an alternative to the SPD for the average worker. For the time being though, the FAUD remains the only substantial syndicalist group in the German Empire, preaching about the values of anarchism, anti-militarism, and anti-totalitarianism.§!"
GER_radical_socialist_party:0 "USPD"
GER_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Unabhängige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§LIndependent Social Democratic Party of Germany§!\n§gThe USPD was formed in 1917 as the divide between anti-war SPD members and their party allies became too much for the former to bear, leading them to create their own radical party separate from the SPD. The USPD quickly became a hotbed of revolutionary thought and a safe haven for formerly exiled leftists within Germany, advocating pacifism, democratic socialism, and Marxism. Their political zenith would be found in the November Uprisings of 1918, where they would cooperate immensely with the Spartacus League in a direct revolution against the Reich government. The failure of these uprisings has evidently permanently crippled the USPD as a political force, with many of their charismatic leaders executed or exiled in the aftermath of the uprising. Now, the USPD is headed by the far-less-revolutionary Paul Levi, who continuously restricts the party from ever exercising anti-government violence ever again.§!"
GER_social_democrat_party:0 "SPD"
GER_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands\n§LSocial Democratic Party of Germany§!\n§gOriginating in 1863, the SPD is one of the oldest parties in Germany. During the Weltkrieg, this strength was threatened when the SPD split in two between the "mainline" SPD and the radical anti-war USPD. After the failure of the November Uprisings, the party shifted further into nationalism to survive the German Red Scare. Despite prior government sanctions, the fall of Ludendorff allowed the SPD to join the Grand Coalition led by Tirpitz for the 1927 elections, pushing more anti-war and anti-imperialist members out of the party. While still supporting voting reform and welfare programs, a noticeable current of patriotism can also be seen. The SPD's voter block is the strongest among the lower classes and the industrial areas along the Rhine.§!"
GER_social_liberal_party:0 "FVP"
GER_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Fortschrittliche Volkspartei\n§LProgressive People's Party§!\n§gCreated in 1910, the FVP is the social liberal alternative to the NLP. The FVP was a staunch opponent of the Ludendorff Dictatorship, supporting political liberalisation and electoral reform. Thanks to the FVP's strong support among liberal civil servants, as well as its intellectual heavyweight and one of chief leaders Thomas Mann, it has easily become an effective opposition party. Nowadays the group represents interests of liberal elites, romantic nationalists, and large swaths of academia. Their platform includes wide electoral reform, liberalization of society, and heavy investment in the German culture.§!"
GER_market_liberal_party:0 "NLP"
GER_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Nationalliberale Partei\n§LNational Liberal Party§!\n§gCreated in 1866, the NLP began as a prominent backer of the Bismarck chancellorship. However, after his turn to the right the party's influence waned immensely. The NLP was powerless in the Reichstag during the Weltkrieg, especially as the center lost influence. When the DVLP was created, some thought the NLP would be completely absorbed, but Stresemann kept the party independent. After the rise of Tirpitz, the NLP joined the Great Coalition, supporting German colonialism, army expansion, and liberal economic policies. Stresemann's patriotism combined with the admission of Max Weber, famed sociologist, slowly transformed the NLP into a competitive force. Although historically close to the economic elite, Weber's growing popularity has brought more of the entrepreneurial middle-class, anti-Junker businessmen, and various individualistic academics to the party's fold.§!"
GER_social_conservative_party:0 "Zentrum"
GER_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Zentrumspartei\n§LCentre Party§!\n§gCreated in 1870, the Zentrum has traditionally represented German Catholics with the Kulturkampf hardening its federalist views. Later due to the actions of the leader of the parliamentary faction Matthias Erzberger, the party would be the architect of the Reichstag’s Peace Resolution of 1917. They would ultimately join with Tirpitz's Great Coalition in an effort to build broader appeal, but Erzberger's less than patriotic stance often hurt the group, leading to Franz von Papen's current de facto management of the party. Regardless, Zentrum has pulls in support of not only German Catholics but also anti-Centralization groups and disaffected workers unwilling to join the SPD. Recently as well, Papen's right-wing has pushed Zentrum into an uneasy coalition with the DkP, for the time being.§!"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "DkP"
GER_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Deutschkonservative Partei\n§LGerman Conservative Party§!\n§gThe DkP, founded in 1876, was deeply influential in the Bismarck era, leading the cause of protectionism and centralizing the new German state beneath Prussia. Ultimately, the party's power would wax and wane throughout the 1910s, especially as radical nationalism began to grow more popular during the Weltkrieg. The Ludendorff Dictatorship would slowly find the DkP pushed aside as the demagogue and his compatriots favored the DVLP. The DkP ultimately joined alongside other parties of the Great Coalition to maintain a hold in the government, sharing the some positions with the DVLP. After the 1927 elections, Kuno von Westarp began a deep rightward shift, opening light association with the Pan-German League and various rural movements in order to keep the party competitive against both the DVLP and the Zentrum. Currently, the DkP represents Junkers, most rural farmers, and the average German conservative.§!"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "DVLP"
GER_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Deutsche Vaterlandspartei\n§LGerman Fatherland Party§!\n§gFounded in 1917, the DVLP had its origin in the jingoism of the wartime German Empire, especially due to the influence of its founder Erich Ludendorff. It was with him that the party would enjoy the height of its power, functionally controlling the whole of the German Empire. However, the general's rule would not last, and his ignominious removal from power and scapegoating by the rest of the German right had sent the DVLP into a freefall. While the group has had to evolve much in the wake of Ludendorff's fall and its Great Coalition-era management under Alfred von Tirpitz, the platform's core has remained mostly same. Hoping to wield Empire's state organs for the 'righteous cause', the DVLP is known for reactionary monarchism, desire for pre-eminence of the military, and its far-right leanings in both economics and political orientation. The connection to Völkisch groups such as the Pan-German League, as well as the recent leadership of the party under Alfred Hugenberg, has thus far paid off in keeping the DVLP existent.§!"
GER_national_populist_party:0 "DF"
GER_national_populist_party_long:0 "Deutsche Fraktion\n§LGerman Faction§!\n§gThe DF is less of a party and instead more of a catch-all term for the various influential far-right nationalist groups that wield influence in the Empire one way or another, with a figurehead leader and foremost speaker in the form of Moeller van den Bruck. While seen as the origin point of the growingly powerful anti-parliamentary and illiberal 'Young Conservative' movement, he mostly exercises behind-the-scenes power incorporating influential figures within the arms of disparate political clubs beneath his influence. However, even with Moeller as the principle 'leader' of the DF, the movement's rhetoric changes intensively between its constituent groups. The DF's fractious nature has made it incapable of manifesting much in the way of electoral victory. This diversity is seen within its alignment of smaller parties such as the German Völkisch Party, Christian Social Party, and sections of the Free Conservative Party.§!"

GER_doctrine_new:0 "Military Reform"
GER_doctrine_new_desc:0 "With the death of Hans von Seeckt and the retirement of August von Mackensen, the Chief of General Staff has been embroiled in heated debate as to which military doctrine should be adopted. We should establish an impartial committee of military officers to oversee the adoption of new doctrine."

GER_doctrine_great_war:0 "Squad Tactics"

GER_doctrine_great_war_2:0 "The Modern Art of War"
GER_doctrine_great_war_2_desc:0 "There is one book that every man who wants to become an officer in the army of the Reich must read - Clausewitz's 'The Art of War'. If we put our best military theorists on the subject, they can adapt the still applicable principles from the centuries-old book to the requirements of modern warfare."

GER_doctrine_mobile:0 "Motorised Infiltration"
GER_doctrine_mobile_desc:0 "While our military high command is divided on many subjects, they are united on one topic: that the possibilities mass motorisation offers to our infantry can be exploited to win decisive and speedy victories on an operational scale, hearkening back to the victory of 1870/71."

GER_doctrine_mobile_2:0 "A New Doctrine"
GER_doctrine_mobile_2_desc:0 "Some of the more radical innovators in our high command including, among others, Heinz von Guderian and Erich von Manstein, are lobbying for research into a totally new doctrine. They want to focus on the fast movement of armoured spearheads to break up solid fronts."

GER_mil_expansion:0 "Military Expansion"
GER_mil_expansion_desc:0 "The Chief of General Staff has been embroiled in heated debate as to which military doctrine should be adopted. We should establish an impartial committee of military officers to oversee the adoption of new doctrine."

GER_squad_tactics:0 "Squad Tactics"
GER_squad_tactics_desc:0 "The Chinese Intervention and more recent conflicts have convinced our officers of the importance of coordination within individual squads.

GER_doctrine_mobile_3:0 "Invest in Panzer Factories"
GER_doctrine_mobile_3_desc:0 "With a little directed investment we could raise the productivity of our armour factories quite substantially. Some of our more conservative-minded generals are unlikely to approve of this investment however."

GER_mil_expansion_naval_1:0 "Finish 1934 Navy Plan"
GER_mil_expansion_naval_1_desc:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands unchallenged on any sea, for now. The Union of Britain, the French Commune, the Americans and the Japanese all jealously seek to catch up with us and if left unchecked, our naval domination will end as quickly as it began. We should continue the large navy modernisation project initiated back in 1934 to keep our fleet one step ahead of our rivals."

GER_global1:0 "Supply Lines to Singapur"
GER_global1_desc:0 "Having an empire across the globe has the small disadvantage of having to actually exert control over those areas, and that means sending not only soldiers, but also tax collectors and other vermin. Our officials need tax forms and invoice documents, bureaucratic elements that need to be sent all the way from Germany. We must ensure that our supply chain is adequately supported to reflect this reality."

GER_global2:0 "Expand Singapur Harbour"
GER_global2_desc:0 "Now that we have the capacity to exert our control more effectively over the supply lines to Ostasien, we need an adequate endpoint to the chain. The harbour of Singapur is the busiest in the eastern hemisphere, with German ships on their way to the Chinese concessions, Australasians Delhi-bound and the occasional American or Russian. Commerce is good; we should expand the harbour."

GER_north_sea1:0 "Expand Wilhelmshaven"
GER_north_sea1_desc:0 "We require an expanded port for basing for both our submarines and our larger fleets. Investing into the crucial Kaiserliche Marine base at Wilhelmshaven is a good start for accomplishing this."

GER_north_sea2:0 "Flanders-Wallonia Naval Bases"
GER_north_sea2_desc:0 "We require more ports in the North Sea to ensure we have a chokehold over our enemies' trade and to discourage a repeat of the Weltkrieg blockade. Expanding our naval bases within Flanders-Wallonia such as in Antwerpen will help this goal."

GER_north_sea3:0 "Secure the Skagerrak"
GER_north_sea3_desc:0 "The Skagerrak is the vital strait between Denmark, Norway and Sweden. We must secure it to prevent our fleets becoming locked within the Baltic Sea in the event of the Kiel Canal being blocked."

GER_generic_navy1:0 "Fortify the North Sea Coast"
GER_generic_navy1_desc:0 "The North Sea Coast must be defended. In the unlikely event that our entire fleet is lost then our flanks would be dangerously exposed, and so we must begin fortifying the coastline at once."

GER_generic_navy2:0 "Fortify our Naval Bases"
GER_generic_navy2_desc:0 "In line with the coastline fortifications we should seek to better defend our vital naval bases from amphibious invasion."

GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing:0 "Heed Dönitz's Words"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing_desc:0 "The highly respected and talented Karl Dönitz reminds us that the success of ocean-going navies is dependent on them actively controlling the seas. Our fleets should strive for large, decisive battles and destroy our opposition before they get a chance to intercept our supply routes. This doctrine has been dubbed Präsenzflotte."

GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing2:0 "U-Boat Warfare"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing2_desc:0 "We conducted U-Boat warfare throughout the Weltkrieg but we restricted our attacks in order to avoid courting international condemnation. This policy shall continue but with a new range of U-Boat models at our disposal."

GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing3:0 "Larger, Faster, Heavier"
GER_doctrine_fleet_in_beeing3_desc:0 "Larger, faster, heavier. These are the words that our navy should live by when designing new warships. We shall make it so."

GER_doctrine_base_strike:0 "Listen to Patzig and Raeder"
GER_doctrine_base_strike_desc:0 "Patzig and Raeder have, in close communication with Sperrle of the Luftwaffe, devised a type of naval strategy reliant on mobile airbases in the form of carrier ships. These men are convinced that on the open sea, where assistance can take days to arrive, ships should only be risked if they fight together as one group with air cover under a doctrine known as Operative Manövergruppen."

GER_doctrine_base_strike2:0 "Naval Air Force Research"
GER_doctrine_base_strike2_desc:0 "The Luftwaffe have demanded extra funding if they are to implement the new Manövergruppen naval doctrine. We should grant this funding with the expectation of solid results."

GER_doctrine_base_strike3:0 "Extend Carrier Research"
GER_doctrine_base_strike3_desc:0 "Manövergruppen requires new carriers. We shall construct these stalwart new additions to our Grand Fleet at once."

GER_doctrine_fleet1:0 "Modernise Our Cruisers"

GER_doctrine_fleet2:0 "New Destroyer Fleet"
GER_doctrine_fleet2_desc:0 "Destroyers cannot escape the gaze of our new modernisation programme. We will draft and construct a new modern destroyer fleet."

GER_tirpitzprogramm:0 "Renew Tirpitzprogramm"
GER_tirpitzprogramm_desc:0 "By 1914, the Tirpitzprogramm had given Germany the second-largest naval force in the world. That was a long time ago, and the British fleet is no longer the biggest in the world. All the same we must not be idle. Germany must continue its extensive ship building efforts if we are to remain master of the high seas."

GER_naval_plans:0 "Deutschland beherrscht die Meere"
GER_naval_plans_desc:0 "Deutschland beherrscht die Meere ("Germany Rules the Waves") are the words our navy lives and dies by. However, not since the Second Battle of Jutland has the navy had a worthy adversary. With the Communards and English once again rebuilding their fleets, this may change thus we must ensure that the next generations of sailors knows how to properly handle themselves.  To this effect, we shall launch a new series of training exercises on the North Sea coast to give our sailors some more experience at sea."

GER_marines1:0 "Independent Seebatallions"
GER_marines1_desc:0 "We must retrain and expand our marine corps to meet new challenges against enemies overseas. Granting them increased autonomy within naval command should give us better results."

GER_marines2:0 "Marine Transports"
GER_marines2_desc:0 "We lack dedicated landing craft for our Seebattalions. This must change if we are to storm the British coastline and take our fight to nations on distant seas. We shall design and construct a new dedicated amphibious landing craft to meet this challenge."

GER_doctrine_last:0 "New Textbooks"
GER_doctrine_last_desc:0 "Since 1810 the famous Prussian War College has been inarguably the most prestigious military institute for higher learning in the world. However, prestigious does not necessarily mean up to date. Our military doctrine has thoroughly changed in the last few years, and while some classics never get old - Clausewitz still saves stressed students - others have fallen out of date. It is time to replace them."

GER_security:0 "Fund the Preußische Geheimpolizei"
GER_security_desc:0 "The Syndicalist terror is nearly as bad as back in 1928, when Reichsbank President Karl von Helfferich was shot by a lone gunman. Back then, a countrywide crackdown brought some measure of peace, but now security forces seem powerless. There have been proposals to increase the funding for the Prussian Secret Police, an institution dating back to 1854 with reach extending beyond Prussia or even the Empire's borders. Under the supervision of the Generalpolizeidirektor, the Geheimpolizei will continue working to ensure Germany is safe from the darkness of radicalism."

GER_security_prerequisite:0 "Either §YFranz von Papen§! or §YKurt von Schleicher§! is the head of government."

GER_security_2:0 "Ban French Organisations"
GER_security_2_desc:0 "The formerly French-controlled regions in western Germany have been unruly for a long time. French nationalism is widespread, and French cultural and political organisations have strong roots in the region even now. Banning them could suppress French nationalism, or it could serve to inflame tensions and radicalise the population. The Commune of France will not be happy either way."

GER_security_3:0 "Manoeuvres in Elsaß-Lothringen"
GER_security_3_desc:0 "The despicable Communards feel bold enough to defy our rule and are supporting insurgents in Lorraine! After extensive talks with the Kaiser and High Command, the Chancellor has approved partial mobilisation of the reserves and is considering a massive military exercise in Alsace-Lorraine involving air and armour detachments and military observers from the Reichspakt member states."

GER_security_4:0 "Destroy the Internationale"
GER_security_4_desc:0 "The greatest threat to stability in the world is by far the Syndicalists, and they have no greater stronghold than the Internationale. For years, High Command has dreamed of leading troops into Paris again, restoring order in Europe and eradicating the vile Red Menace forever. There is no better time than now to strike. Let the communards tremble, for the Reichspakt comes!"

GER_IRE_deal:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
GER_IRE_deal_desc:0 "Assailed from all sides, the Irish have turned to the Reich for protection. We should offer them a full treaty so that we'll have a loyal ally in the fight against the Union of Britain."

GER_DKB_deal:0 "Military Mission to the Cossacks"

GER_Mauser_werke:0 "Mauser Contracts"
GER_Mauser_werke_desc:0 "Founded under the auspices of the mighty Friedrich himself, Mauser has been instrumental in aiding the growth of German power over the past century. By sponsoring them more directly we can increase and improve our small arms production."

GER_Luftwaffe_airbases_1:0 "Build More Airbases"

GER_Henschel_Albatros:0 "Naval Aviation Corps"
GER_Henschel_Albatros_desc:0 "Another result of the untangling of air warfare from ground warfare has been the founding of a group of aviators focused on naval aviation. These pilots, trained in special courses, are now demanding aircraft to fit their special requirements."

GER_Junkers_Fogger:0 "Long-Range Fighters"
GER_Junkers_Fogger_desc:0 "As a result of the Bombergruppen doctrine, the demands on range of operations has multiplied. Theorists and researchers are demanding new aircraft models to keep up with their increasingly aggressive bombardment plans. After the Paris bomber comes the London bomber, after that the Moscow bomber - and there doesn't seem to be an end!"

GER_mil_expansion_land_1:0 "Militarist Revival"
GER_mil_expansion_land_1_desc:0 "The German people are renowned for their bellicosity and national pride. The Weltkrieg, however, cost us dearly and many a family was denuded of its menfolk. It is time for us to revive the militaristic spirit of the Prussian era, in the name of the Reich and the Kaiser!"

GER_Infantry_divs:0 "New Weapons"
GER_Infantry_divs_desc:0 "While the German army has the greatest soldiers in the world, it must not lag behind in equipment terms. Even the greatest of soldiers will have a hard time defeating a better equipped enemy and it would not do for the pre-eminent world power to have troops armed with broomsticks."

GER_political_1:0 "Imperial Restructuring"
GER_political_1_desc:0 "While it is an undeniable fact that the German Empire is the greatest nation to ever grace the pages of history, there is always room for improvement. In light of recent 'shortcomings' in our administration we should look into making various policy changes and reforms for a better future."

GER_black_monday_aftermath:0 "Aftermath of Black Monday"
GER_black_monday_aftermath_desc:0 "The great stock market crash of 1936, widely known as 'Black Monday', has already had a massive impact on German politics, culture, and society. While the damage might never be truly known, let alone fixed, we should enact reforms and recovery policies to regain some of our lost capacity."

GER_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the civilian industry horribly, and the military industry has been affected even worse. Our military supply specialists are clamouring for a programme for the extension of war-relevant industries, or Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien, to ensure our military has bullets to fight."

GER_mil_industry_3:0 "PEkI II"
GER_mil_industry_3_desc:0 "The Programm für die Erweiterung kriegswichtiger Industrien - or abbreviated PEkI, but who would want to abbreviate such a good, German word - is making progress. At least our arsenals don't have to open their last reserves whenever a unit wants to move out anymore. There's still some way to go, but at least we are on the right path."

GER_civ_industry_1:0 "ZIP I"
GER_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "Our heavy industry is in shambles, with many workers out of a job after their former employers were forced to submit to the crisis. Some of our leading economic researchers have proposed a plan for civil industrialisation, the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan, to revitalise the civilian industrial sector."

GER_civ_industry_2:0 "ZIP II"
GER_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "The first phase of the Zivilindustrialisierungsplan has shown promise, but there is more yet to come. At least some of the worst social and economic disaster has been alleviated, though."

GER_civ_industry_3:0 "ZIP III"
GER_civ_industry_3_desc:0 "With our civilian industry once again strong, but not yet booming, we are required to take just a few more steps. Soon enough German industry will tower above the rest of the world once more, as the steady influx of resources from the colonies assures a massive production boost."

GER_further_siemens_contracts:0 "Siemens Favouritism"
GER_further_siemens_contracts_desc:0 "With our shift recovery owned much to the efforts of Siemens, the government has seen to it that they are further "favoured" in regarding any new construction contracts."

GER_arms_industry:0 "Military Industrial Complex"
GER_arms_industry_desc:0 "With unrest in the West and the bear awakening in the East, Germany for then ever needs to be ready for the challenges that are ahead of it. With investing in our local arms producers, we will ensure the German soldier is well equipped for the challenges that lay ahead"


GER_industry_finished:0 "Economic Boom"
GER_industry_finished_desc:0 "With our economic policies following the Black Monday widely regarded as a resounding success, private investors have picked up on the lead, and the economy has not only stabilised but is currently experiencing a boom of sorts. It won't hold forever, but for the minute at least we can concentrate on other pressing issues."

GER_siemens:0 "Subsidies for Siemens"
GER_siemens_desc:0 "Siemens is one of the many middle-to-larger sized businesses that form the heart of the German economy. By making contracts with them - and some other smaller industry companies - we can begin treading the slow and steady path to economic recovery."

GER_krupp_steel_focus:0 "Krupp Steel"
GER_krupp_steel_focus_desc:0 "All this talk about infrastructure and helping our citizens is nice, yes, but what about artillery? Tanks? Planes? The world isn't safe, and Friedrich Krupp AG has the solutions we need! They've served Germany for generations, and the time has come to call on them again."

GER_infra_1:0 "Deutsche Bahn"
GER_infra_1_desc:0 "Germany is a large, busy nation, and the most practical solution for transporting goods and supplies is definitely locomotives. Funding a quick project to touch up our rail-system and extend it to some more rural parts of the country will stimulate the economy and help connect the nation a bit more."

GER_infra_2:0 "Reichsautobahn"
GER_infra_2_desc:0 "Trains are now, but cars are the future. Reichskanzler Tirpitz ordered the construction of several highways throughout Germany, but the projects remain uncompleted--Worse, progress has all but stalled in the wake of Black Monday. We need to not only complete this project, but think even bigger..."

GER_infra_3:0 "Europabahn"
GER_infra_3_desc:0 "Mitteleuropa is large and impressive on paper, but we just aren't making the most of it. Several regions, especially Eastern Europe, are not connected to Germany properly. A main reason for this are the underdeveloped and poorly maintained rail systems that result in constant logistical bottlenecks. We can fix this, and we will."

GER_economy:0 "State of the Economy"
GER_economy_desc:0 "It's good, really. The industry is humming along, the grain is coming in from the eastern member states of the Reichspakt, many citizens have work. It's looking up for the Kaiserreich, and it seems like nothing will be able to stop the golden age of the late Reichskanzler Tirpitz..."

GER_research_expansion:0 "Extra Research Funding"
GER_research_expansion_desc:0 "Investing in science and technology to stimulate advances in both military and civilian affairs. Isn't that an awfully good phrase? It doesn't really say anything, but it sure sounds good. Anyway, the laboratories are over there..."

GER_ig_farben:0 "Embrace Synthetic Rubber"
GER_ig_farben_desc:0 "With increasing demand of rubber skyrocketing prices, we should remind the world that the first synthetic rubber was created in the Bayer laboratories in Elberfield, and as such we can employ the minds of our chemists to further refine the methods of creating it, to augment our sources of natural rubber."

GER_krupp_focus:0 "Krupp AG Contracts"
GER_krupp_focus_desc:0 "The Krupps are an almost 400 year old dynasty of industrious Germans, who have fed the Reich's war machine ever since the Thirty Years War! It is time we put them in state employment again, as their talents will be badly needed with a new Weltkrieg imminent."

GER_artillery_research:0 "Artillery Research"
GER_artillery_research_desc:0 "An area in which the German army has a longstanding tradition of lagging behind is the area of light support artillery. While the successes in building huge, unwieldy and impractical prestige objects such as the 'Paris Gun' can't be doubted, it's time to invest in some of the more practical - and more efficient - alternatives."

GER_doctrine_armor:0 "Armoured Breakthrough"
GER_doctrine_armor_desc:0 "Another crucial point of Guderian and Manstein's new doctrine is the so-called Schwerpunkt. They believe that Panzer technology has advanced to a point where massed, mobile Panzer forces, with adequately equipped support troops, should be able to lead any offensive to victory. Now they need new Panzers to fit this idea."

GER_hahn_meitner:0 "Support Hahn & Meitner"
GER_hahn_meitner_desc:0 "Herr Hahn and Fräulein Meitner are both extremely talented physicists; Hahn is regularly published in science journals even in the Syndicalist bloc, and Meitner is a department head at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute! Together, we believe, the two can help create extremely powerful tools for society. And even more powerful weapons."

GER_rocket:0 "Support von Braun"
GER_rocket_desc:0 "Von Braun is a notorious proponent for the field of 'Rocketry' and is the most accredited scientist for the field worldwide. He comes to us with the offer of new weaponised designs in return for sponsorship. We should heavily consider this."

GER_zuse:0 "Support Konrad Zuse"
GER_zuse_desc:0 "Konrad Zuse has already handed in several patents for what he calls a 'computing devices'. With proper sponsorship, his mind could be put to good use by the state, for the state."

GER_black_monday_radio:0 "The Kanzler and the Radio"
GER_black_monday_radio_desc:0 "The crisis has shaken the German's belief in their country. Public faith is key, so starting weekly radio addresses to announce what steps the government has taken to combat the crisis will help avoid panic and keep trust in our administration."

GER_groener1:0 "Liquidate Unprofitable Estates"
GER_groener1_desc:0 "The statesman Wilhelm Groener has recently published an essay titled 'The black zero: the need for austerity', in which he demands absolute balance discipline, even if it means losing some companies depending on subsidies. The essay has found a lot of adherents within the populace, and liquidating a few unprofitable companies may be just what we need to alleviate our expenditures."

GER_groener2:0 "Reichsarbeitsdienst"
GER_groener2_desc:0 "The contacts and friends of Groener in military circles have now proposed a radical innovation. For the duration of the crisis, recruits will be able to choose to fulfil half a year of military service as manual labourers in state service instead. While bad for recruitment numbers, this will inject some much needed labour into our economy."

GER_groener3:0 "Gehaltskürzung"
GER_groener3_desc:0 "Cutting the enormous salaries of those "Officials" who can more then afford to do so, hasn't been met with open arms. Many have called Groener a Syndicalist in sheep clothing, but quickly retracted their statements on threat of release of their "Expenses" during the crisis. Though it would appear that Groener won't be invited to any social gatherings amongst the aristocracy for quite some time."

GER_schacht1:0 "Bail Out Junker Estates"
GER_schacht1_desc:0 "The president of the Reichsbank, Hjalmar Schacht, has demanded a green light to go ahead with his economic programme, dubbed the 'Schachtplan'. According to him, we need to bail out the highly indebted Junker estates if we don't want to trigger an even further descent into chaos."

GER_schacht2:0 "Investitionsprogramm"
GER_schacht2_desc:0 "The next part of the Schachtplan would be a massive programme aiming to encourage private investment, both into Mittelstand businesses as well as consumer products. While this will be hard to achieve, it should enable producers to find a market for their products again, which will hopefully help to restart the economy."

GER_schacht3:0 "Goldstandard"
GER_schacht3_desc:0 "By dropping the standard of gold within the Empire, will allow for productivity to grow due to further reliance on the Mark. Though many have argued against this, stating the effects of Black Monday are more short term then long term, Schacht reply is that short term effects are crippling the Empire and allowing for it's competition to get ahead."

GER_zollverein:0 "Reform Mitteleuropa"
GER_zollverein_desc:0 "For too long Mitteleuropa has existed in name only. It is time for is to start reforming it to actually benefit its members...and us. The first step is unified tariffs."

GER_synthetic:0 "Research in Synthetics"
GER_synthetic_desc:0 "In cooperation with members of the Kaiser Wilhelm society, IG Farben researchers have already been able to make astounding breakthroughs on the area of synthetic production. By giving them access to more funds, we might be able to make their research ready for mass implementation."

GER_experimental_research:0 "Experimental Research"
GER_experimental_research_desc:0 "While we have already made good progress in some of the more traditional fields relevant to industry - engineering, chemistry, physics - some of our scientists want funding to conduct research into some more esoteric matters. Though profit might not be as immediate, the long-term potential is immense!"

GER_black_monday_finish:0 "Finish Black Monday Reforms"
GER_black_monday_finish_desc:0 "It seemed impossible, but the numbers confirm it - the crisis is nearing its end. The key point is that it is not yet over. There are still millions without jobs, and civil society has been stretched to breaking point. The catastrophe of Black Monday will leave marks for a generation, but this is the beginning of the end."

GER_organize_the_youth:0 "Organise the Youth"
GER_organize_the_youth_desc:0 "Some experts have suggested that the best solution against the current lawlessness in our nation's youth would be organising them so that they can learn new skills and employ their energy for the public good. The Pfadfinder organisation would require increased spending for such an endeavour."

GER_a_christian_trade_union:0 "A Christian Trade Union"
GER_a_christian_trade_union_desc:0 "By founding the Deutscher Christlicher Gewerkschaftsbund as a state-endorsed union, we will hopefully establish a bulwark against attacks on the workers' loyalty from left and right. Workers will be able to voice their concerns under the moral authority of priests and the guiding hand of the 'summus episcopus': the Kaiser."

GER_jet:0 "Cult of Aviation"
GER_jet_desc:0 "The image of the aviator has changed in the current conflict. They have replaced the cavalry as the image of the glorious and gallant war. Every child aspires to be an aviator and streak across the skies in his shining armour. By further fostering this image, we can motivate our pilots to give their very best in the service of the Reich."

GER_linie1:0 "Reactivate the Ludendorfflinie"
GER_linie1_desc:0 "The Syndicalist menace looms darker than ever. In fear of going into the next war unprepared, the reactivation of the old Ludendorfflinie on our western border is considered vital. Once one of the dictator's many costly prestige projects, the line of bunkers and fortifications has fallen into disuse in recent years. This is nothing that cannot be solved with a bit of engineering ingenuity!"

GER_linie2_full:0 "Over the Meuse and Far Away"
GER_linie2_full_desc:0 "Our puppet regime in Brüssel is screaming for help against the Syndicalists. Extending the reactivation of the Ludendorfflinie over the Meuse river and up to the North Sea coast would be costly and take up precious time - but it might enable us to make a stand on foreign soil so that not one German civilian is threatened."

GER_linie2_small:0 "Fortify Bastenach Alone"
GER_linie2_small_desc:0 "Our resources are stretched thin and time is of the essence. Even though Flanders-Wallonia may lie somewhat undefended compared to the Franco-German border, we cannot afford to waste time defending foreign territory that will be lost sooner or later anyway."

GER_linie3:0 "Fortify the Rhineland"
GER_linie3_desc:0 "The Rhineland is the most heavily industrialised region in the entire world and absolutely vital to our economy, both in peace and in war. All the same, it lies only a few miles away from a border that many have been eyeing nervously in recent months. In order to prepare against any eventualities, we should start extending the Ludendorflinie northwards."

GER_schule:0 "Paderborner Luftkriegsschule"
GER_schule_desc:0 "The establishment of a formalised school for our aviators would help immensely in unifying and promoting this currently somewhat disorganised field. There are a lot of heroes of air warfare from the Weltkrieg, the most famous of course being the Red Baron himself, whose insight can still be valuable to new recruits. There, they could impart their wisdom to a new generation of German pilots."

GER_institut:0 "Institut für Luftfahrttechnik"
GER_institut_desc:0 "An independent research organisation for aviation technology, the Institut für Luftfahrttechnik, could prove a major stepping stone on the way to ensuring German dominance not only on the ground and on the sea, but also in the skies."

GER_heerflieger:0 "Keep the Fliegertruppe"
GER_heerflieger_desc:0 "Our aviators are currently organised as part of our army structure, without an independent air force command. This boosts cooperation between aviators and ground troops, and therefore leads to the current doctrine concentrating solely on that; air support with ground force primacy. This specialisation is suitable and should remain our policy."

GER_luftwaffe:0 "An Independent Luftwaffe"
GER_luftwaffe_desc:0 "Since the Weltkrieg the Red Baron, Manfred Freiherr von Richthofen, has argued for the establishment of an independent air force - the Luftwaffe, as he likes to call it. Up until very recently, the conservative elements in the traditionally more prestigious ground forces have been able to prohibit this, but with war looming once again, it might be time to consider the Baron's idea."

GER_sturzflieger:0 "Sturzflieger"
GER_sturzflieger_desc:0 "One concept that has recently found a lot of supporters among aviation researchers is that of an aircraft that dives from great heights onto the battlefield to deliver its payload, using its momentum to climb again immediately afterwards. This concept, dubbed Sturzflieger, would minimise the time our precious aircraft would be in immediate danger."

GER_cas:0 "Coordinated Close Air Support"
GER_cas_desc:0 "The requirements and possible uses of close air support aircraft have proven to be far different from those of more mainstream fighter aircraft. If we concentrate our air research capabilities on identifying and exploiting the intricacies of this specialised form of air warfare, we should be able to achieve far better results in aircraft manufacturing."

GER_para:0 "Found the Luftlandetruppe"
GER_para_desc:0 "Due to our continuing focus on ground-air cooperation, there have been proposals of greatly expanding our Paratrooper division, which is currently in its infancy. This might have to do something with the fact that jumping from a flying plane does not seem very glorious or entertaining - or survivable, really. We should promote the image of the paratrooper as the spearhead of the Kaiser's military."

GER_bombergruppen:0 "Bombergruppen Doctrine"
GER_bombergruppen_desc:0 "One of the first results of the founding of Richthofen's Luftwaffe has been the invention of a new doctrine. This doctrine asserts that the possibilities of massed bomber warfare are exciting enough to warrant primacy over the traditional ground support. Fighters should not be used on the ground, where they can be subjected to anti-air attacks, but in the skies where they can escort bomber squadrons."

GER_singapore_airstrips:0 "Expand Singapur Airstrips"
GER_singapore_airstrips_desc:0 "Singapur is the centrepoint of German East Asia. A fortress city, it has great demands for both civilian as well as military airstrips. We should meet this pressing need by investing in construction to protect our naval station from foreign rivals in the region."

GER_finalise_centralisation:0 "Finalise Centralisation"
GER_finalise_centralisation_desc:0 "The independent postal services of the kingdoms of Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria in southern Germany are some of the last remnants of the old federal structure of Germany. By finally expanding the responsibilities of the national German postal service to these states, we could help suppress these damaging particularist tendencies. Germany is not something you can opt out of!"

GER_democracy_in_prussia:0 "Democracy in Prussia"
GER_democracy_in_prussia_desc:0 "The current voting system in Prussia is archaic and undemocratic. The people are split into three strata according to their income, with the lowest strata, representing over sixty percent of the population, receiving as many delegates as the upper one, which represents less than ten percent! We should finally implement universal, secret and equal franchise for all citizens of Germany."

GER_easter_promises:0 "The Easter Promises"
GER_easter_promises_desc:0 "On April 7th 1917, when the war was at its very worst, after the horrifying 'Turnip Winter', the Kaiser promised substantial reforms and the abolition of the three-class voting system in Prussia. However, he promised all of that without offering an actual date. It might be time to remind the Kaiser of his promises..."

GER_embrace_faud:0 "Embrace the FAUD"
GER_embrace_faud_desc:0 "The Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands has been a troublesome organisation. By embracing them and finally allowing them to operate unhindered, we could maybe make sure that they don't radicalise further."

GER_women_suffrage:0 "Women's Suffrage"
GER_women_suffrage_desc:0 "While the Prussians now finally have their universal, secret and equal franchise, the women of Germany are still exempt from the vote. Awareness of this issue has been steadily rising, and clubs modelled on the British suffragettes are recruiting new members. If we want to avoid the public embarrassment that the British suffered in that affair, we should maybe consider fulfilling their requests."

GER_schleicher:0 "Polizeiaufgabengesetz"
GER_schleicher_desc:0 "Because of the threat from the International, we can't afford to endanger the security of the Reich through improper liberalization. It would be best if we first ensure that there is still a Reich in the future, so we should expand the powers of our police so that they can better enforce the law in these dangerous times! As for the reforms... our people will soon understand that we are only acting for their own good and that we'll continue them as soon as the situation allows."

GER_schleicher_prerequisite:0 "Requires §YKurt von Schleicher§! to be the head of government."

GER_restore_country_rights:0 "Restore the Bundesrat"
GER_restore_country_rights_desc:0 "Under the Ludendorff regime, many of the privileges of the constituent countries of Germany were abolished. The largest of these insults was the formal dissolution of the Bundesrat, the chamber where delegates from all countries can voice their concerns and vote on empire-wide legislature. By reinstating this organisation, we would send a powerful and positive signal to the states of Germany."

GER_babelsberg:0 "Expand Babelsberg"
GER_babelsberg_desc:0 "The Babelsberg film studios have long replaced Hollywood as the most influential film industry of the world. However, on movies as far removed from politics as possible, is anything but supportive of the state. Some producers, namely Leni Riefenstahl, have proposed some projects that, with our funding, could help remind the Germans of their glorious past and future."

GER_europakammer:0 "Europarat"
GER_europakammer_desc:0 "There have been recent proposals swirling around for a new body to increase integration of Mitteleuropa. Europarat, or the 'Council of Europe' would act as an effective monitor of cross-European trade and relieve the administrative burden of it on all Mitteleuropa."

GER_europakommission:0 "Europakommission"
GER_europakommission_desc:0 "With the resounding success of the initial Mitteleuropa reforms we shall expand and extend it to include further industrial measures under a single Europakommission. This body would focus on harmonising industrial regulations across Mitteleuropa and unifying the economies of all members over time."

GER_poland_war:0 "Bring Back Order"
GER_poland_war_desc:0 "Poland has been a diplomatic oddity in Europe for far too long. Stuck in political limbo between the German and Austrian power blocs since the end of the Weltkrieg, it is time for proper German order to be brought back to the Polish state. Either through strong diplomatic effort or by force of arms, Poland will be brought into the German sphere where it belongs."

GER_poland_alliance:0 "Deepen Polish Ties"
GER_poland_alliance_desc:0 "Our initial forays into improving diplomatic ties with Poland have met with some amount of success. It seems that Poland too wishes to settle our past disputes and break the political stalemate of the past two decades. A proper diplomatic mission to Poland should warm our mutual relations and set the foundation for Poland to eventually move into our own sphere of influence."
GER_destroy_internationale:0 "Destroy the Internationale"
GER_destroy_internationale_desc:0 "The greatest threat to stability in the world is by far the Syndicalists, and they have no greater stronghold than the Internationale. For years, High Command has dreamed of leading troops into Paris again, restoring order in Europe and eradicating the vile Red Menace forever. There is no better time than now to strike. Let the communards tremble, for the Reichspakt comes!"

GER_subjugate_russia:0 "Subjugate Russia"
GER_subjugate_russia_desc:0 "While we dealt the Russian Bear a crippling blow in the Weltkrieg, years of covert and open rearmament have made the Russian nation eager for war and revenge against the German Empire. As long as the Russian threat exists on the eastern border, Germany and her allies are not safe. We cannot continue to let the menace of the East continue to build up its strength gradually; it is time to curb Russia's ambition and bring peace and order to the East once and for all."

GER_oil_caucasus_land:0 "Through Ukraine"
GER_oil_caucasus_land_desc:0 "One route to ensuring that we have uninterrupted oil supplies is by securing access across the great steppe from the Don-Kuban Union of the proud Cossacks.

GER_oil_caucasus_treaty_desc:0 "The time has come for us to acquire our main prize, the oil of Azerbaijan.

Furthermore, the Sublime Porte was never really able to catch up with the west in terms of military development and has since mostly relied on imported goods.

GER_unity_justice_freedom_desc:0 "Radicalism has been contained and the status quo has been upheld. The next government has been decided and the Kaiser has nominated a new Reichskanzler to lead the nation for the next 5 years. It is now time to get down to business and shape our policy, whether that be taking the nation in an entirely new direction or ensuring stability."

GER_popular_germany:0 "A Popular Germany"

GER_spd_kanzler:0 "A SPD Kanzler!"
GER_spd_kanzler_desc:0 "The Kaiser has nominated the leader of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands to head the new coalition, focusing on improving the plight of the everyday German worker. Many believe that order to stay in power the SPD must navigate a fine line between social democracy and anything that may be considered syndicalism. If executed properly, we may be able to placate the more left-leaning elements of society and show those French dogs that one must not overturn the natural order in order to further the cause of the working class."

GER_denounce_marxism:0 "Marx, the German Hero"
GER_denounce_marxism_desc:0 "Contrary to what the vile Syndicalists of France and Great Britain seem to think, the father of modern Socialism, Karl Marx, was never closed to the idea of the establishment of a Socialist society from a Capitalist society, the proof is that he never really expressed in an explicit way the way of taking power by the workers and that he showed himself in several of his texts to be in favor of political, economic and parliamentary action within the liberal regime. It is hardly that the Syndicalists had never really read this author, perhaps this is due to their barely hidden Germanophobia which they let show through their revanchist propaganda. Because yes, we must not forget it, but Marx is above all a hero of the workers who is German, France and Great Britain having never invented Socialism, preferring tyrannical and authoritarian regimes. The SPD must follow the path traced by Marx and fulfill his will through Reformism, Democracy, Freedom and Socialism, and away from extremism and tyranny!"

GER_healthcare_reform:0 "Healthcare Reform"
GER_healthcare_reform_desc:0 "The idea of universal healthcare is a German one, with 1883's Sickness Insurance Law the first of its kind in the world. The law isn't perfect though, as it allows employers to deduct a portion of a worker's paycheck to fund their insurance, and does nothing for the unemployed. We must take this idea one step further, and offer free insurance to the unemployed as well as subsidize businesses to the shoulder the cost of their employees' healthcare as well as prohibit deductions."

GER_industrial_subsidies:0 "Subsidize Industry" #Feel free to rewrite
GER_industrial_subsidies_desc:0 "Industrial prosperity has always been at the core of the SPD's platform. While stopping at full nationalization of industry, the government should subsidize German industry to ensure fair payment of workers."

GER_protect_unions_desc:0 "Every worker deserves the right to be heard. After the FAUD crisis, we need to enshrine labor protections to ensure a worker's right to organize. Not all unions are created equal, however, and those with syndicalist tendencies will receive no such protections."

GER_fvp_kanzler:0 "A FVP Kanzler!"

gerdom.1.t:0 "The Constitution of the German Kaiserreich"
gerdom.1.d:0 "After the crushing defeat of the Second French Empire by forces of the North German Federation, our constitution was signed in 1871 by representatives of the Federation and four other states in southern Germany. The new constitutional framework created integrated the southern states into the Prussian-led Federation, thus giving the enlarged entity a new identity as the Deutsches Reich.\n\nAccording to the constitution, the Empire is a federation of twenty-five German states. The title of Bundespräsidium, or Federation President, was held by the King of Prussia, a figure now invested with the title of Emperor of Germany. The Emperor directly appoints the Chancellor, the head of government and chairman of the Bundesrat, the council of representatives of the German states. Laws are enacted by both the Bundesrat and the Reichstag, the lower house Imperial Diet elected by male Germans above the age of 25 years.\n\nWith an option to dissolve the Reichstag on a whim, it is clear that the main political power in the German Empire actually rests not in Reichstag, elected by the people, but in the hands of the non-elected German Emperor. Another issue is the Prussian three-class voting system, which has remained mostly unchanged since 1849.\n\nOver sixty years after the founding of the Kaiserreich, the liberals and social democrats are growing increasingly disgruntled with the status quo and our constitution may need revision soon to help us weather the upcoming turbulence..."

Afterwards, the Chief of the Army, August von Mackensen, could be seen whispering something to the Kaiser in private. It was revealed shortly thereafter that von Mackensen himself intends to retire."

gerdom.11.t:0 "Agricultural Crisis in Mitteleuropa"
gerdom.11.d:0 "During this time of great crisis, the complacent agricultural sector of the German economy has proven to be particularly vulnerable to the economic downturn. With this in mind several Junkers, representing the landed nobility of the Kingdom of Prussia, have asked for protectionist legislation and state subsidies for their agricultural production. By imposing tariffs on foreign produce, we will strengthen this vital sector of the Reich's economy and protect our farmers. Unfortunately such a measure is likely to cause further damage to the economy of our neighbours, dependent as they are on German markets for their food exports. The wheat crop in the Ukraine is particularly vulnerable, and choosing to enact protectionist measures might seriously damage them and our other agrarian partners."

In these troubled times for the Empire, we must be careful in formulating a policy response liable to cause domestic tensions. Granting the suffragists what they ask would anger the more conservative elements of our government, particularly members of the Reichstag, a body currently elected solely by universal male suffrage. On the other hand, a stern refusal followed by reprisals may lead to further protests and riots, especially in the more liberal states, many of which already permit female voting in regional assemblies."

Some of them have proven fundamental to our propaganda efforts with very many of them began working in factories to relieve the men that had to leave and fight the enemy at the front. Their contribution has been invaluable and they have proven their ability and independence time and time again. For these reasons, the suffragist movement is stronger than ever and asking once again that the government grant women the right to vote and to run for office."

gerdom.14.t:0 "The Halbstarke Terror"
gerdom.14.d:0 "With the devastating economic situation, many families struggle to earn their daily bread and the social security net is strained to the breaking point. In recent weeks the streets of many German cities have been increasingly terrorised by gangs of teenagers. These 'Halbstarke' steal products from the markets and shops, and often money from innocent pedestrians, or commit acts of vandalism to escape boredom and frustration. Few citizens feel safe on the streets anymore and it is clear that what some in the government might see merely as low-level civic disorder instead has the makings of total societal breakdown."

gerdom.15.d:0 "The Kaiserliche Marine stands as the strongest navy in the world in the year 1936, but many challenges will face it in the coming years. The expansionist Empire of Japan and resurgent Syndicalist fleets of Britain and France are both key future enemies seeking to unseat German naval superiority across the world.\n\nIn 1934, we started a major naval construction plan, and many of the ships laid down in that period are well on their way to being finished. Unfortunately, with our naval industry limited due to ongoing economic malaise, we will have to limit ourselves to one area of production.

The prestigious Berliner Tagblatt, already responsible for the publication of the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1923 that led to the end of the Ludendorff regime, has landed another major scoop.\n\nA reporter was able to observe and even partially overhear a conversation between Reichskanzler Kurt von Schleicher and the leader of the reactionary Junker party DVLP, Alfred von Hugenberg, at a Berlin varieté. The relatively low standing of the establishment only adds to the scandal and while crowds come together to discuss the news, one question is on everyones' lips - what will the Kaiser's reaction be once he opens his morning newspaper?"

gerdom.18.d:0 "While there is no shortage of capable thinkers in our Staff, one may argue that the issue we currently face is actually having too many of them. Currently, the Staff has divided itself into three groups of competing thought.\n\nProponents of an infiltration-focused doctrine, backed by Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord, argue that the fighting spirit of the infantry and well-trained battalions backed with the highest quality weapons available acting in perfect coordination is the key to success.\n\nMeanwhile, Georg Bruchmüller, a seasoned officer from the Weltkrieg, proposes an artillery-focused doctrine with an emphasis on heavy bombardment to facilitate a breakthrough, replacing the infantry charges of old with even more shells than we've traditionally used.\n\nFinally, the least popular group of theorists led by Erich von Manstein and Heinz Guderian passionately argue for a large tank army backed up with motorized and mechanized infantry, envisioning an armored breakthrough with coordinated air support to get behind the enemy's lines.\n\nDuring a typical briefing with the Kaiser on the military, Heinz Guderian initiated an especially inflammatory argument with Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord on the matter of production priorities. While seemingly trivial, these arguments have been becoming more common as of late over every minor detail.\n\nThe situation has reached a boiling point, and it falls on the aging Wilhelm to come to a decision. Who has his support?"

### Weapon Manufacturer Selection event ###

gerdom.19.t:0 "Choosing a Weapons Manufacturer"
gerdom.19.d:0 "As the world continues to become more dangerous, many in our government are suggesting that we could benefit from selecting a single arms manufacturer to standardize production and equipment standards. Naturally, German industry is robust and we have several choices available to us!\n\nMauser, dating all the way back to 1811, is perhaps the most obvious choice. They have a global presence, and have provided us with weapons for years--Such as the sturdy and reliable bolt-action Karabiner 98k.\n\nHaenel has been around since 1840, and is a smaller and less likely choice. However, there is a remarkable simplicity and sturdiness about their weapons that we can use. They also have some interesting ideas for weapons that can fire multiple bullets without needing to be bolted back with every shot!\n\nMostly, Walther, founded in in Ulm back in 1886, makes pistols--Good ones. However, they could easily accommodate our needs with just a bit of funding. Their weapons are well-rounded, but don't particularly excel in any one area.\n\nSauer & Sohn is the oldest of them all. If anyone could get us plenty of guns quickly, it would be them. Time is short, and we need to get a substantial army in the field; it might be best to just get a weapon in our men's hands as long as it fires.\n\nWe have the forms filled out and ready. Who do we send them to?"
gerdom.19.a:0 "Mauser, as always."
gerdom.19.b:0 "Erma shouldn't exist, why is this option here?"

gerdom.43.d:0 "Reichskanzler Brüning has arrived in the Vatican as part of the new Zentrum administration's policy to improve relations with Rome, and by extension the Pope. What has not been decided, however, is how far this meeting with the Pope will go and what exactly will be discussed. We could either embark on a new relation with the Papacy and the Catholic world in general, or merely exchange pleasantries. Our coalition partners in the mostly Protestant DkP have threatened to make passing future legislation more difficult if we take this too far, so we may want to tread carefully. On the other hand, having friends on the Italian peninsula as well as investing in Catholic-led industry may be reward enough."

gerdom.52.d:0 "The Freie Arbeiter-Union Deutschlands, or Free Worker's Union of Germany, is an umbrella organisation of several trade unions founded during the turbulent period in 1919 during the French Revolution. They have repeatedly denounced the Syndicalist terror and therefore been allowed to operate unimpeded until now, however our intelligence services have produced definite proof that their leaders are in contact with Syndicalist organisations in other nations, such as the CNT-FAI in Spain. We also suspect that some members may be directly plotting against the Kaiser!"

gerdom.61.t:0 "Syndicalist Involvement in the General Strike"
gerdom.61.d:0 "Although the general strike in the Rhineland is finally over an official inquiry into the event has suggested that a number of rebellious workers were supplied from abroad.

gerdom.65.d:0 "Admiral Wilhelm Souchon, a hero of the Weltkrieg and a Großadmiral in both our fleet and the Ottoman fleet, has passed away today.

gerdom.66.d:0 "Feldmarschall Bruchmüller a hero of the Weltkrieg and key developer of modern artillery tactics, has passed away today. Known to all as 'Breakthrough Müller' for his decisive actions during campaigns on both the Western and Eastern fronts, he will surely be missed by all Germans."

gerdom.74.t:0 "The Division of Mittelafrika"
gerdom.74.d:0 "As part of our new Kaiserbund policy it is incumbent on us to issue directions as new administrative arrangements in our colonies. One such territory is Mittelafrika. While conservative members of Reichstag are eager to leave the autonomous state unmolested, the bulk of our political establishment have already realised that Freistaat of Mittelafrika acts as a burden for both the German armed forces and our economy. Among the limited benefits the colony offers us is imperial prestige, and even then the Dark Continent is no longer seen in the same light as during Scramble for Afrika. Therefore, drastic reorganisation of this area is needed if we want to retain our presence in Afrika with while limiting our costs as much as possible."
gerdom.74.a:0 "Divide Mittelafrika into states."
gerdom.74.b:0 "Federalise them."
gerdom.74.c:0 "Keep the status quo."

gerdom.75.t:0 "Status of Malta"
gerdom.75.d:0 "With our new Kaiserbund policy currently being instituted by all limbs of the German state, the gaze of our officials has reached the Mediterranean island of Malta. Almost all important members of the general staff and many conservative politicians are arguing for keeping this island under direct control. They argue that Malta is crucial for the security of our Mediterranean shipping lanes between Marokko and the Suez, and point to its function as an 'unsinkable aircraft carrier'."
gerdom.75.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."
gerdom.75.b:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

#gerdom.76.t:0 "Status of Somaliland"
#gerdom.76.d:0 "With our decision to implement Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide extent of its implementation on various fringe regions under our control. One such region is the German Somaliland. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep Gulf of Aden under our control, the most of politicians would rather cut down our expenses with administration of this territory even at cost of diminishing our presence in this area."

gerdom.77.d:0 "We will have to reorganise our internal structure in accordance with the new orders from Germany..."

gerdom.81.t:0 "Status of Aden"
gerdom.81.d:0 "With our decision to implement the Kaiserbund programme we still have to decide the extent of its implementation in various fringe regions under our control. One such region is Aden in the Yemen. While admirals of Kaiserliche Marine are arguing for keeping this territory under our direct control as a way to keep the Gulf of Aden under our control, most politicians would rather cut down on our administrative expenses even at the cost of diminishing our presence in the region."
gerdom.81.a:0 "Grant them limited autonomy."

gerdom.81.c:0 "Keep them under our direct control."

gerdom.82.t:0 "Germany Offers Us Aden"
gerdom.82.d:0 "The Germans have sent us an offer in which they will secede us the Aden and in return we become their protectorate. The offer is tempting to say the least, should we accept it?"
gerdom.82.a:0 "Accept the offer!"
gerdom.82.b:0 "We refuse!"

gerdom.83.t:0 "Yemen Accepted"
gerdom.83.d:0 "The Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen has agreed to our offer and they have become our protectorate."

gerdom.84.d:0 "With the passing of the great Weltkriegskaiser Wilhelm II, Wilhelm III has given a grand speech on his coronation day to guide all of Germany towards prosperity and to safeguard our interests across the globe!"
gerdom.84.a:0 "Heil dir im Siegerkranz!"

gerdom.85.t:0 "Germany Bans French Organisations!"
gerdom.85.d:0 "In response to the increasing self-assurance and revolutionary spirit of the Commune, the pathetic German leadership has instituted a harsh policy of cracking down on any organisations funded by us or related to French culture or politics in any manner. These discriminatory actions aimed against the struggling French minority within Germany, particularly in our occupied regions of Nancy and Alsace, are absolutely intolerable."
gerdom.85.a:0 "This shall not stand. To war!"
gerdom.85.b:0 "Assist French resistance groups."
gerdom.85.c:0 "Publicly condemn German actions."
gerdom.85.e:0 "We should avoid entanglements at this stage."

gerdom.86.t:0 "International Condemnation of Our Ban!"
gerdom.86.d:0 "The Commune of France used our recent actions aimed against all French organisations within the German Empire to organise an international conference on the issue. They publicly condemned what they call 'German Imperialism' and pledged to do everything possible to protect the French minority within the Reich. In response, several important members of the international community similarly condemned our actions against the French population, stating that such actions are a stain on the honour of a modern state. How should we react to this public humiliation?"
gerdom.86.a:0 "The Communards are behind this, destroy them!"
gerdom.86.b:0 "Germany cares not for the protests of minnows."
gerdom.86.c:0 "Restore the rights of the French minority."

gerdom.91.t:0 "German Mission Arrives in Don-Kuban"
gerdom.91.d:0 "The German Empire decided to send an official military mission to our homeland in order to help us improve our obsolete armed forces. Such missions are well regarded for their impact on the militaries of nations like Ukraine and Venezuela, and we are fortunate to have them."
gerdom.91.a:0 "We will show them Cossack hospitality!"

gerdom.92.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck and the Flame of German Resistance"
gerdom.92.d:0 "This is the darkest hour of the German Empire. Defeated by the planes, tanks and tactics of a brutal foe, the imperial government has evacuated Berlin and is currently converging, shell-shocked and battered, on Daressalam. However, the army is not Germany itself, and under the African skies our loyal colonies remain committed to the war effort. All the same, the Reich's government as it stands is facing loathing for presiding over the greatest military catastrophe in German history, and many senior army officers are demanding the appointment of a new emergency chancellor. Many of them are clamouring for Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck to be elevated to this position, given his successes in Afrika during the Weltkrieg and the loyalty and affection that he commands among the askaris we must now rely on."
gerdom.92.a:0 "Yes! Appoint von Lettow-Vorbeck! Heia Safari!"
gerdom.92.b:0 "No! This would be the last nail in the coffin of our democracy!"

gerdom.93.t:0 "Lettow-Vorbeck Proposes an 'Afrikakorps'"
gerdom.93.d:0 "Chancellor von Lettow-Vorbeck has stood before the emergency government and argued that the German state must raise additional units of native schutztruppen, also known as askaris. These doughty soldiers have served the Reich faithfully ever since the chancellor outwitted the Entente in the jungles of Ostafrika during the Weltkrieg. Controversially, von Lettow-Vorbeck has also proposed that we grant the native kings, princes and vassals that rule Afrika in our stead complete independence once we retake our Vaterland. Such a reward would incentivise our native population and leaders and invigorate them to assist us in getting to Berlin. This is a desperate proposal, but the Reich is going through desperate times."
gerdom.93.a:0 "Rally the askaris from all of Mittelafrika!"
gerdom.93.b:0 "Pointless. We need German troops for a German war!"

gerdom.94.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Südwestafrika"
gerdom.94.d:0 "One of the first German colonies, Südwestafrika has proven especially loyal to the imperial government. However, its close connection with the founding of the German colonial empire might make it difficult for conservatives within our cabinet to accept the prospect of independence that has promised by von Lettow-Vorbeck."
gerdom.94.a:0 "Excellent."

gerdom.95.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Ostafrika"
gerdom.95.d:0 "The site of some of the most impressive battles fought by the German colonial army under von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg, Ostafrika, with its capital of Daressalam, is seen by most officials as the jewel in the crown of the Reich's African possessions. As such the German administration is deeply entrenched here and cooperation with the natives run smoothly, resulting in a large turnout of volunteers for the new Schutztruppen."

gerdom.96.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Deutsch-Kongo"
gerdom.96.d:0 "Taken from the defeated Belgian state after the Weltkrieg, the Congo occupies the heart of Central Africa and has for decades of German administration been heavily militarised to secure the Reich's control over the province."

gerdom.97.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Äquatorialafrika"
gerdom.97.d:0 "Strategically located to the immediate south of the Sahara, the colony of German Equatorial Africa employs some of the most impressive auxiliary troops, most of which have spent years fighting nomadic raiders on the border."

gerdom.98.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Niger-Kamerun"
gerdom.98.d:0 "One of the more recently acquired African provinces, Niger was merged with the German colony of Kamerun in the Mittelafrikan state. Though somewhat disunited, the natives stand ready to earn their independence in the pay of the Reich!"

gerdom.99.t:0 "Afrikakorps in Togoland"
gerdom.99.d:0 "Consisting of the original German colony of Togo and the annexed British and French colonies of the Gold Coast and Dahomey, the askaris formed here are of a notably lesser quality than seen elsewhere in Mittelafrika. All the same, they stand ready to assist Germany in its hour of need - for the right price."

gerdom.100.t:0 "Decolonisation of Afrika"
gerdom.100.d:0 "In the darkest hour of the German Empire, Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck rallied the colonial askaris behind the Reich by promising them independence once the war had been won. Our enemies have been crushed and Berlin liberated, leading to many of our African subjects humbly asking us to uphold our promises and commence the decolonisation of our domains in Africa."
gerdom.100.a:0 "We shall uphold our promises."
gerdom.100.b:0 "Afrika shall remain German forever more!"

### Security ###

gerdom.105.t:0 "Germany Suppresses its French Population!"
gerdom.105.d:0 "The German Empire, afraid of the rising power of our state decided to tighten control of the border regions, since they are fearful of our growing influence! We must be patient, soon the time will come, when our brothers in Wallonia, Lorraine and Alsace shall be liberated!"
gerdom.105.a:0 "Soon, our time shall come!"

gerdom.106.t:0 "Further Internal Security Measures"
gerdom.106.d:0 "Despite the gradual increase of military and police presence in our border region, it is still not enough. Underground French Syndicalist leaders are still on loose, poisoning the minds of our French minority with propaganda, with many using existing French organisations as cover for their vile acts. In order to fully secure our territorial integrity, right-wing members of our government have demanded the complete dissolution of all French or French funded organisations. However, even if such drastic step may seem necessary, it will undoubtedly damage our reputation in the international community..."
gerdom.106.a:0 "Current security measures are sufficient!"

gerdom.200.t:0 "The German Role in the World Revolution"
gerdom.200.d:0 "Ever since the failure of the November Uprisings, the syndicalist cause in the Kaiserreich has been neutered and forced underground into organization or intellectual debates that go nowhere. Even the Rhineland, home to millions of workers, has not manifested any meaningful leftist resistance to the regime in Berlin, much to the delight of the government. The rest of the world, however, is not so complacent with the present dominance of "international capital", and so civil wars and revolutions of all sorts have sprung up across the globe.\n\nSeeing all of this chaos as opportunity, leftist paramilitary leader Wilhelm Zaisser has initiated the creation of a German "International Division" that would participate in one of the ongoing conflicts abroad. He now proclaims to the few followers he has that German participation in the world revolution, and the shedding of their blood in that process, will show that the German people are not completely lost to the whims of the Kaiser. The Reich Security agencies, meanwhile, seem more than willing to turn a blind eye to Zaisser's "brigade" leaving the country, assuredly hoping that he and the rest of his brethren die in bitter conflicts elsewhere.\n\nOf course, Zaisser could always just stay in Germany, and fruitlessly organize for a red revolution that will never truly manifest. Regardless, his men await his command, wherever in the world it may lead them."

### Foreign Events ###

gerfor.1.t:0 "Union of Britain Attacks Denmark"
gerfor.1.d:0 "The Union of Britain has declared war on Denmark. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the Internationale, and the Danish government has asked for our help. Shall we warn the Syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or say nothing, and risk losing Denmark?"
gerfor.1.a:0 "Warn them to turn back or face German arms!"
gerfor.1.b:0 "We have enough problems to be dealing with."

gerfor.2.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum Over Denmark"
gerfor.2.d:0 "The Second Reich has sent an ultimatum to London. We are to either make peace with Denmark and declare a ceasefire or Germany will come to Denmark's aid. Though it is certainly in our interests to seize the Skagerrak and pose a dangerous threat to Germany on its northern border, calling their bluff may prove to be extremely risky."
gerfor.2.a:0 "We will not risk war with Germany over this."
gerfor.2.b:0 "We do not negotiate with imperialists."

gerfor.3.t:0 "German Assistance Against Britain"
gerfor.3.d:0 "We are in a state of war with the Union of Britain. Our military, while proud, will not be able to withstand the Syndicalist onslaught. Some influential figures are petitioning us to ask the Germans for help, even if it might mean having to accept some German influence after the invasion is repelled. What shall we do?"
gerfor.3.a:0 "Thank you Berlin!"
gerfor.3.b:0 "The Germans cannot be trusted."

gerfor.4.t:0 "Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.4.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the British Isles. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today. We have shown the world that we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or the Commune."
gerfor.4.a:0 "Yet again German diplomacy wins the day."

gerfor.5.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Denmark Ultimatum"
gerfor.5.d:0 "Despite the ultimatum being received by London their forces continue their move towards Danish territory, demonstrably ignoring our simple demands. We can either declare war and bring Denmark into our alliance or we can stand down and let Denmark fall, creating a northern front with our Syndicalist foe."
gerfor.5.a:0 "They have made their choice, war it is!"
gerfor.5.b:0 "Back down. There will be peace in our time."

gerfor.6.t:0 "Britain Backs Down Over Denmark"
gerfor.6.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders ordering an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal to British territory. Denmark's independence has been preserved and our pride left intact. All the same, the fact that it took German intervention to protect us is somewhat unsettling."
gerfor.6.a:0 "We couldn't have done it without them."

gerfor.7.t:0 "Internationale Seeks to Reunify Italy"
gerfor.7.d:0 "The combined forces of the French Commune and the Socialist Republic of Italy have launched an attempt to seize the entirety of Italy. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in Europe in favour of the Syndicalists. Shall we warn the Internationale that this threatens world peace or let the peninsula fall to their malignant ideology?"

gerfor.8.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum Over Italy"
gerfor.8.d:0 "The German Empire has sent us a telegram, demanding that either we end our intervention in Italy and declare a ceasefire with the Italian states or the Reich will intervene by force."

gerfor.9.t:0 "Germany Sends the Internationale an Ultimatum"
gerfor.9.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France over their support for the Socialist Republic of Italy in its attempts to conquer the entire peninsula. The Germans demand that the Syndicalists fall back or risk utter annihilation."

gerfor.10.t:0 "Commune of France Withdraws from Italy"
gerfor.10.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by Paris, they quickly withdrew their forces from the frontlines and abandoned the peninsula. Our independence will be preserved, and our pride left intact."
gerfor.10.d.sri:0 "Drawing [FRA.GetNameDef] into our war with [ITA.GetNameDef] was perhaps not the wisest idea. The war drew the attention of the Reich which issued an ultimatum to [FRA.GetNameDef] to cease the invasion. The [FRA.GetAdjective] government has complied, ordering our own forces to stand down. We have little choice but to comply."

gerfor.11.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Italy"
gerfor.11.d:0 "After we sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France to cease their intervention in Italy and backing for the Italian Syndicalists in the war, they wisely decided to comply. Already Red forces are withdrawing and our prestige has been greatly heightened. Yet again we have used diplomacy to help guard the balance, and improve prospects for European peace."

gerfor.12.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Italian Ultimatum"
gerfor.12.d:0 "Our ultimatum was flatly ignored. Already SRI and Communard forces are on the march in Italy and refusing to return to their pre-war boundaries. The other states of the Italian peninsula are threatened existentially and Syndicalism is poised to spread its vile ideology to every corner of the land. The issue now is, do we back up our ultimatum with force and declare war on the Internationale?"

gerfor.13.t:0 "Commune of France Invades Spain"
gerfor.13.d:0 "The armed forces of the Commune of France have launched an invasion of the Spanish state. This invasion threatens to disrupt the balance of power in favour of the syndicalist alliance. Shall we warn the syndicalists about the foolishness of their actions or let Spain fall?"

gerfor.14.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Spain"
gerfor.14.d:0 "Monarchies are as thick as thieves. After we began our campaign against the Spanish kingdom we received a message from Berlin ordering us to cease and desist in our military efforts. They claim that if we do not bring our forces back beyond the Pyrenees they will intervene militarily to preserve the current status quo."

gerfor.16.t:0 "Commune of France Backs Down in Spain"
gerfor.16.d:0 "The Germans have achieved a significant diplomatic coup today, and helped preserve our independence. After the Reich sent an ultimatum to the Commune of France ordering them to cease their military aggression towards us, the French wisely decided to comply and brought their troops back from beyond the Pyrenees. The status quo remains, for now at least, intact."

gerfor.17.t:0 "Commune of France Ignores Spanish Ultimatum"
gerfor.17.d:0 "Despite our public condemnation of the Communard invasion of the Spanish Kingdom and subsequent ultimatum, the French have refused to pull their forces back. The possibility of the loss of yet another European monarchy can no longer be discounted, and the choice is now incumbent on us to decide how we should respond to this flagrant dismissal of German hegemony."

gerfor.24.t:0 "Enemy at the Gates"
gerfor.24.d:0 "The Russians have reached the Oder. There has been little outright panicking in Berlin but it is clear that without a counter-attack Germany is greatly endangered. The last supply reserves have been distributed to volunteers and everyone is participating in this last effort to defend the Vatherland."
gerfor.24.a:0 "Not one step back!"

gerfor.25.t:0 "Die Wacht am Rhein"
gerfor.25.d:0 "The French have reached the Rhine. Our substantial border fortifications were seemingly unable to stop their inexorable advance and now our crucial industrial cities are falling one after another. The situation is quite dire, and already there are treasonous murmurings that the Communards could reach Berlin itself."
gerfor.25.a:0 "They must be stopped!"

gerfor.27.t:0 "Germany Occupies Spanish Morocco!"
gerfor.27.d:0 "The German Empire, in a show of absolute arrogance and disrespect towards our state, has occupied Spanish Morocco. Shockingly, their forces have even moved into Ceuta and Melilla, two cities that have been inviolable Spanish territory for many centuries."
gerfor.27.a:0 "There is nothing we can do..."
gerfor.27.b:0 "Such outrage will not be tolerated!"

gerfor.28.t:0 "Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.28.d:0 "The island of Madagascar has been under our rule for several decades and it is an untapped source of rare timbers like ebony and several varieties of rosewood. As these sources have not been exploited, several industrialists and members of the colonial government have proposed that we establish a joint-stock company with authority over the timber industry on the island. Shall we decree the establishment of such a company?"
gerfor.28.a:0 "Create a new joint-stock company."
gerfor.28.b:0 "Leave the industry alone."

gerfor.29.t:0 "Expanded Logging in Madagascar"
gerfor.29.d:0 "The joint-stock company that we established has began to show some results and our inventory of rare timber has steadily increased. However, with the mechanisation of logging, several thousand locals have been put out of work. The company has at the same time advised that we begin construction on a new timber processing plant to streamline production. If we were to fund this new project it would kill two birds with one stone, so to speak."
gerfor.29.a:0 "Create the new processing complex."
gerfor.29.b:0 "In this economy?"

gerfor.30.t:0 "New Madagascan Processing Complex"
gerfor.30.d:0 "The new timber processing complex has opened and the transformative effects on the local economy were immediate. Many workers responsible for the initial construction were retained by the company and many new workers were needed after construction was complete, dramatically increasing employment in the area. The access to rare timbers has also increased and a gala was held in Tananarive to toast the new complex's opening."
gerfor.30.a:0 "A successful colonial endeavour."

gerfor.31.t:0 "Uprising on Madagascar"
gerfor.31.d:0 "With no end in sight to the rising unemployment on Madagascar, many Malagasy locals, and especially the former loggers, have risen against us. What started as merely a local insurrection quickly spiralled into outright rebellion with an independence war brewing."
gerfor.31.a:0 "We really don't need this right now..."

gerfor.32.t:0 "A Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.32.d:0 "With the fall of France our armed forces have unsuccessfully tried to gain control over the British Isles and decisively end the war in our favour. Unfortunately, Republican resistance has proven stronger than we previously anticipated, and attempts to launch a full-scale naval invasion have soured. We can now either continue the armed struggle or try to end this futile conflict by way of a peace treaty."
gerfor.32.a:0 "It is time for an armistice."
gerfor.32.b:0 "This will only end with German boots marching through London."

gerfor.33.t:0 "Germany Proposes a Second Peace With Honour"
gerfor.33.d:0 "Attempts from the Reichspakt to gain a foothold on our island and decisively end the war have failed miserably. Though the collapse of the Commune was a terrible blow to the Revolutionary cause, British arms have proven to be too much for Jerry to handle. Now the leadership of the German Empire is offering us a proposal - to terminate conflict between the Reichspakt and the remaining members of Internationale in exchange for mutual recognition. How shall we react?"
gerfor.33.a:0 "Survival is all we can hope for. Sign."
gerfor.33.b:0 "Another humiliation? Never again!"

gerfor.34.t:0 "Second Peace with Honour Signed"
gerfor.34.d:0 "It is finally done. Though we had hoped for the total obliteration of the Union of Britain and the end to Syndicalist influence in Europe, alas it was not to be. Instead the British wisely decided to make terms with us, signing the treaty in sight of a full German military parade. With this the bulk of the fighting is now over, and the Second Weltkrieg virtually ended in Europe."
gerfor.34.a:0 "Peace at last!"

gerfor.35.t:0 "The British Refused Peace!"
gerfor.35.d:0 "In a staggering display of British stubbornness, the Syndicalist wretches flatly denied our calls for a peace treaty. Instead of swallowing their pride and accepting the inevitable, the Republican government said that they would not have a Second Peace With Honour, and would end the war by marching through Berlin."
gerfor.35.a:0 "They will pay for this insolence."

gerfor.36.t:0 "Ethnic Conflict on Sri Lanka"
gerfor.36.d:0 "Ceylon Island is settled by Sinhalese and Tamils, who have battled for supremacy on the island for ages. With Black Monday wreaking havoc on our economy and colonial administration, disobedience from the native population is becoming intolerable. Our presence on Ceylon, crucial for its supplies of rubber, is becoming increasingly precarious."
gerfor.36.a:0 "Damn those nationalists!"

gerfor.37.t:0 "Union of Britain Invades Norway"
gerfor.37.d:0 "The Union of Britain has made the bold move of declaring war on the Norwegians, seeking to impose Syndicalism on them by force of arms. This invasion shows scant regard for German supremacy in Europe and the status quo that we have spent years maintaining. The question now is, what should our response to be this act of barbarism by the British?"

gerfor.38.t:0 "Germany Sends an Ultimatum over Norway"
gerfor.38.d:0 "We have received a damning telegram from the Reich. They are demanding that either we cease our invasion of Norway or face the full might of the Kaiserliche Marine. They cite the inviolability of sovereign European nations and a whole lot of guff about guarding the balance, but everyone knows that this act stems from German's desperate attempts to hold onto their hegemonic status on the continent. What should our response be?"

gerfor.39.t:0 "Germany Warns the Union of Britain over Norway"
gerfor.39.d:0 "Germany has come to our aid! They have sent an ultimatum to the Union of Britain, either fall back to their home islands or risk annihilation."

gerfor.40.t:0 "The Union of Britain Backs Down"
gerfor.40.d:0 "After the ultimatum was received by London they quickly sent orders to all of their commanders on the ground to cease fire and return to the coast. We have achieved a diplomatic victory today, we have shown the world we will stand up to Socialist and Syndicalist aggression. We will protect any nation under threat from Britain or France."

gerfor.41.t:0 "Britain Ignores Our Norwegian Ultimatum"
gerfor.41.d:0 "In a display of repugnant audacity, the Union of Britain ignored our ultimatum. North Sea operations do not seem to have altered at all and the Republicans are continuing the war against Norway. We cannot risk the red tide of Syndicalism sinking its tendrils into yet another nation, particularly one important to our strategic interests. At the same time, open war with London would distract us at an inopportune time and potentially lead to the Internationale joining in."

gerfor.42.t:0 "The British Withdraw from Norway"
gerfor.42.d:0 "The Union of Britain appears to have listened to wise counsel, and ceased their operations in the North Sea. The German ultimatum appears to have scared them off, and Syndicalism stopped from claiming yet another scalp."

gerfor.43.t:0 "Treaty with Ireland"
gerfor.43.d:0 "With the Syndicalists awakening all over the world it is crucial for the Reichspakt to help potential allies whenever possible. With Irish sympathies swayed towards Germany due to our support during the War of Independence there now exists the possibility of gaining a strong foothold just under the socialists' noses by getting Ireland into the Reichspakt. We should start by offering them equipment and construction support."
gerfor.43.a:0 "Offer Ireland aid if they join the Reichspakt."

gerfor.44.t:0 "German Offers Support"
gerfor.44.d:0 "The German ambassador has approached us with an offer: if Ireland signs a treaty of association with the Reichspakt Germany will invest in our economy and military. While the benefits from this deal would be immense there are some in the government who are unwilling to rely on foreign aid."
gerfor.44.a:0 "Where do I sign?"
gerfor.44.b:0 "We are doing fine on our own."

gerfor.45.t:0 "Ireland Signs the Treaty"
gerfor.45.d:0 "The Irish have agreed to our offer. According to the treaty we are to supply industrial machines and the licences required to construct additional ones in Ireland itself. Additionally, we are obliged to construct and deliver guns, artillery pieces, and a number of aircraft and armour pieces to bolster their armed forces."
gerfor.45.a:0 "Begin the construction then!"

gerfor.46.t:0 "Ireland Refuses the Treaty"
gerfor.46.d:0 "Unfortunately, the Irish have decided to turn our offer down. Still, our obligations towards Ireland remain the same as they were before."
gerfor.46.a:0 "Oh well."

gerfor.47.t:0 "Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.47.d:0 "We have finally finished preparations of all of the material ordered by the Irish as part of our treaty obligations. The goods are now ready to be delivered and we will give the convoy a military escort all the way to the Ireland."
gerfor.47.a:0 "Get it to Dublin, posthaste."

gerfor.48.t:0 "German Aid Arrives"
gerfor.48.d:0 "The guns, armour, aircraft and industrial machinery that Germany promised us as part of their treaty obligations have finally arrived. We have received a squadron each of fighters and bombers, a number of tanks as well as many artillery pieces and new German machine guns. This could be the first step in a fruitful relationship."
gerfor.48.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.49.t:0 "Our Irish Treaty Obligations"
gerfor.49.d:0 "Unfortunately, with Ireland no longer able or willing to receive our aid the whole programme had to be aborted. Luckily, the equipment and craft already produced remain in our hands and is ready to be used."
gerfor.49.a:0 "Better than nothing."

gerfor.50.t:0 "Peace with [ENG.GetNameDef]?"
gerfor.50.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has negotiated a Second Peace with Honour with [ENG.GetNameDef], since it's clear the [ENG.GetAdjective] have lost their will to carry on the war. This might be a chance for us to end our war with them, as well. Should we take advantage of the opportunity, or continue the battle?"
gerfor.50.a:0 "Let's end this now"
gerfor.50.b:0 "No, we continue the war!"

gerfor.51.t:0 "Germany Requests Austrian Support"
gerfor.51.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, Germany treated us rather shabbily when it came to the Brest-Litovsk divisions, with Poland and Ukraine being forced from our sphere of influence by the glory-hogging Reich. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.51.a:0 "The Kaisers will fight together again!"
gerfor.51.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.51.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.52.t:0 "Germany Requests Ottoman Support"
gerfor.52.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, with the end of the Weltkrieg the Germans refused to assist us in our recovery despite fighting with them virtually unnecessarily, and instead the Reich continued to exploit our serious foreign debt problems. The question now is whether we should assist the Germans in their fight?"
gerfor.52.a:0 "The Sultan shall aid the Reich!"
gerfor.52.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.52.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.53.t:0 "Germany Requests Bulgarian Support"
gerfor.53.d:0 "The Germans have asked us to join them in their war against Syndicalism and the forces of the Internationale. Conservative elements in the country say that it is our sacred duty to defend Europe against the godless Reds while others say that we should not fight Germany's war for them. After all, despite our contributions to the Central Powers in the Weltkrieg being recognised to an extent, Germany seized control of Romania's coveted oil supplies for itself and has neglected us ever since. The question now is whether we should assist the Reich?"
gerfor.53.a:0 "We owe them. It is time to repay the debt!"
gerfor.53.b:0 "The Germans are on their own this time."
gerfor.53.c:0 "Send supplies and volunteers."

gerfor.54.t:0 "Austria Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.54.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.54.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.55.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.55.d:0 "The Ottoman Empire listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.55.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.56.t:0 "Bulgaria Heeds the Call!"
gerfor.56.d:0 "Bulgaria listened to our plea for help and decided to join our alliance! the Reichspakt grows stronger, the Syndicalists will not be able to crush us!"
gerfor.56.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"

gerfor.57.t:0 "Austria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.57.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea but pointedly refused to help us in our time of need. We stand alone in our struggle against Syndicalism."
gerfor.57.a:0 "Shameful."

gerfor.58.t:0 "The Ottomans Refused to Help"
gerfor.58.d:0 "Despite all of our exhortations the Sultan refused to support us at all in our fight against the Internationale."
gerfor.58.a:0 "Damn him!"

gerfor.59.t:0 "Bulgaria Refused to Help!"
gerfor.59.d:0 "The Bulgarians ignored our call for support and instead decided to stay out of the crusade against the Syndicalists. It is not like a Balkan country to avoid a fight."
gerfor.59.a:0 "Traitorous curs."

gerfor.60.t:0 "Austria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.60.d:0 "Austria listened to our plea for help but decided not to join our alliance or begin military operations against the Internationale. Instead they will send supplies and volunteers to help in our struggle against Syndicalism!"
gerfor.60.a:0 "It's better than nothing!"

gerfor.61.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire Promises Some Support"
gerfor.61.d:0 "Though the Sultan was sympathetic to our cause, he made it clear that he did not wish to drag his realm into a needless war with the Internationale. Instead he promised to give us material support and to send volunteers."
gerfor.61.a:0 "The irony is palpable."

gerfor.62.t:0 "Bulgaria Promises Some Support"
gerfor.62.d:0 "The Bulgarian government did not wish to offer us overt military support, believing that though Syndicalism is a terrible plague, war with the Communards would be pointless. They promised to at least give us some equipment and volunteers."
gerfor.62.a:0 "Thank you Bulgaria."

gerfor.63.t:0 "Germany Requests Trondheim Leasehold"
gerfor.63.d:0 "The Kaiserreich has approached our ambassador with a somewhat strange offer: we have been offered a substantial sum of money if we lease them our harbour of Trondheim for twenty-five years, to allow for the creation of a forward base against the Republican navy of the Union of Britain. The Norwegian inhabitants would be allowed to stay, as would our civilian administration, and the boost to commerce in the region would be immense. However, the Syndicalists might decide to retaliate against us if we agree to the offer...\n\nWhat shall we do?"
gerfor.63.a:0 "Money is good!"
gerfor.63.b:0 "We can't anger the British!"

gerfor.64.t:0 "Norway Agrees Trondheim Lease"
gerfor.64.d:0 "The Norwegian government has decided to agree to our offer of leasing Trondheim for the next twenty-five years! A small commission is already on its way to assess the level of investment required to make Trondheim an integral part of our defence against Syndicalism."
gerfor.64.a:0 "Very good."

gerfor.65.t:0 "Norway Will Not Lease Trondheim"
gerfor.65.d:0 "The Norwegian government has decided to not agree to our offer of leasing Trondheim for the next twenty-five years, citing the threat of British retaliation. While understandable and not unexpected, this is still unfortunate."
gerfor.65.a:0 "Kiel will have to be good enough."

gerfor.66.t:0 "Deal with the Devil?"
gerfor.66.d:0 "We have been defeated by the Syndicalist bastards but the Entente still fights on. While it was the inability of their governments to hold on to their lands that led to this whole mess in the first place, many say that we should put aside our differences and join with the Entente to reclaim our homeland."
gerfor.66.a:0 "Talk to the Entente."
gerfor.66.b:0 "We do not need them!"

gerfor.67.t:0 "Germany Seeks to Join the Entente"
gerfor.67.d:0 "The Germans have been defeated by the Syndicalist usurpers. While it was their fault that the Syndicalists have taken control of Europe they are now in the same position as we were just a few years ago. Surprisingly, the Germans have sent a delegate to the Canadian government asking for an alliance. What will our terms be?"
gerfor.67.a:0 "Let them join."
gerfor.67.b:0 "Allow them into the Entente with concessions."
gerfor.67.c:0 "Germany in an anti-German alliance? Madness!"

gerfor.68.t:0 "Entente Talks With Germany"
gerfor.68.d:0 "With the German Reich having been smashed in its heartland by the Internationale, they have fled Europe and now seek desperately to regain their power. They have begun talks with the Canadian administration about joining the Entente itself, in an effort to unite all of our efforts against the Syndicalists. The question now is what us French can exact from the Germans, culpable as they are for this entire mess."
gerfor.68.a:0 "Demand Alsace-Lorraine!"
gerfor.68.b:0 "Demand Alsace-Lorraine and part of their colonies!"
gerfor.68.c:0 "Demand nothing from the Germans."

gerfor.69.t:0 "Entente Talks Successful"
gerfor.69.d:0 "The Entente has accepted our alliance proposal and they haven't requested anything in return! This is the best offer we could hope for!"
gerfor.69.a:0 "Sign the treaty!"
gerfor.69.b:0 "No, we've changed our minds."

gerfor.70.t:0 "Entente Talks Successful"

gerfor.126.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"

gerfor.128.t:0 "Germany Demands Oil and an Embargo on Russia"
gerfor.128.d:0 "Germany's demands were a bit more radical then expected, with them not only demanding oil but also for us to embargo Russia in order to cut off their oil supplies. While our independence will still be gaurenteed, Russia will bear much more resentment towards us. In the long run this could pose serious risk to our nation."
gerfor.128.a:0 "We'll accept."
gerfor.128.b:0 "We can't embargo Russia, but the oil is fine."
gerfor.128.c:0 "This was a bad idea."

gerfor.129.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts the Oil Treaty"
gerfor.129.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted the entirety of our deal, which promises to starve the Russians of oil and provide us with it. Not only have we strengthened ourselves greatly, we have managed to successfully cripple an enemy in the process."
gerfor.129.a:0 "I almost feel bad for them."

gerfor.130.t:0 "Azerbaijan Changes the Deal"
gerfor.130.d:0 "Azerbaijan has changed the treaty to a much more mild approach, removing the Russian embargo clause so that we only get oil from them. In a negotiation one must always make compromises, but the power disparity between us and the Azeris is massive. Should we accept the clause variation?"
gerfor.130.a:0 "We'll concede on the embargo point."
gerfor.130.b:0 "Take it or leave it."

gerfor.131.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Give Concessions"
gerfor.131.d:0 "Germany has refused our tamer approach at the conference, and stated that the deal will be off if we do not both guarantee oil supplies and embargo the Russians. It seems we can't make them budge on this point, so acceptance may be our only option. The alternative could be catastrophic."
gerfor.131.a:0 "Fine then."
gerfor.131.b:0 "Then the conference will end here."

gerfor.132.t:0 "Azerbaijan Refuses Again"
gerfor.132.d:0 "Azerbaijan has refused our deal yet again, and officially put an end to the Baku Conference. The only option left if we want the oil fields is to threaten them with war. The puny state would be foolish to resist us."
gerfor.132.a:0 "We'll look for oil elsewhere."
gerfor.132.b:0 "Third times a charm. Oil or war!"

gerfor.133.t:0 "Germany Threatens War!"
gerfor.133.d:0 "Germany, fed up with us refusing not once, but twice, has threatened us with war if their side of the deal is not met. The Reich is seemingly willing to fight us over this issue, so the oil must clearly be worth a lot to them. A war would mean an end to our country, so we may have no choice..."
gerfor.133.a:0 "Give them their damn treaty."
gerfor.133.b:0 "This is ridiculous!"

gerfor.134.t:0 "Germany Demands Direct Control of Our Oil Fields"
gerfor.134.d:0 "The German diplomats have claimed in the conference that the Azeri government and industrial sector is not equipped to properly exploit the oil deposits in the country. They have recommended allowing them to have complete oversight of our industries by placing German directors into key positions in state-owned oil companies, meaning that together we can access even more oil. While we could all get rich off the deal, the problem is that this could possibly threaten our position as an independent nation."
gerfor.134.a:0 "Well alright then..."
gerfor.134.b:0 "Economic influence is enough, we shall have no directors."
gerfor.134.c:0 "Refuse outright."

gerfor.135.t:0 "Azerbaijan Accepts!"
gerfor.135.d:0 "Azerbaijan has accepted our recent deal, giving us direct control over their oil fields and industry. This essentially makes them another one of our subjects, securing oil for a very long time."
gerfor.135.a:0 "Let the black gold flow."

gerfor.136.t:0 "Azerbaijan Varies the Treaty"
gerfor.136.d:0 "Azerbaijan has vetoed the idea of us having our directors manage their oil companies, and they only wish to have economic guidance. Our influence over the country and its oil supplies would still be immense, though substantially less than with our German oversight of the oil industry itself."
gerfor.136.a:0 "We'll accept the change."
gerfor.136.b:0 "It's this or nothing!"

gerfor.137.t:0 "Germany Accepts the Modified Treaty"
gerfor.137.d:0 "Germany has accepted our version of the treaty, which help us get more out of our oil fields and whilst also gaining us a guarantee from the Reich. In exchange all we need do is ensure that the oil supply remains unmolested and that the shipments reach Germany."
gerfor.137.a:0 "Great!"

gerfor.138.t:0 "Germany Reaffirms the Original Proposal"
gerfor.138.d:0 "The Reich's diplomats have seemingly not budged on their position on having German directors control our oil fields, and this is simply unacceptable for us as it essentially makes us a puppet of Germany. Unfortunately the threat of war is present if we refuse. How do we respond?"
gerfor.138.a:0 "It's this or war."
gerfor.138.b:0 "Maybe the Russians will help?"
gerfor.138.c:0 "We said no the first time, we'll say it again."

gerfor.139.t:0 "Azerbaijan Requests Assistance"
gerfor.139.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Baku Conference between Germany and Azerbaijan over the oil supply, tensions have been heating up. Germany has now formally threatened them with war. Azeri diplomats have sent a telegram asking for our assistance in the matter, and a reward of oil might be in it for us if we help. The question is, should we pressure Germany to back down?"
gerfor.139.a:0 "Send a stern message to Germany."
gerfor.139.b:0 "We won't upset the Germans."

gerfor.140.t:0 "Germany Proposes Research Treaty"
gerfor.140.d:0 "The German government has proposed a military research treaty between our two nations. Though relations between our two nations have not been particularly close for some time, we could benefit greatly from German military assistance."
gerfor.140.a:0 "This sounds like a good idea!"
gerfor.140.b:0 "Bulgaria needs no help."

gerfor.141.t:0 "Bulgaria Accepts the Research Treaty"

gerfor.143.d:0 "The ambassador of Germany has informed us of recent developments in the Reich. As a result of a recent policy change in Berlin their current priority is solidifying their control over the Mediterranean. Already in control of the Suez, they are now demanding that we hand the Rock over to them."
gerfor.143.a:0 "Well, do we even have a choice?"
gerfor.143.b:0 "Refuse this outrageous demand."

gerfor.190.d:0 "Russia has been unified under the sheer might and awe-inspiring power of the Kaiserreich’s military. With the largest nation on the planet subjugated by the greatest military power on Earth, we could have easily bent the nation to our own desires and oppressed the local Russian people without obstruction or reproach, but instead we graciously decided to bring civilization to this savage, frozen wasteland. As our war machine tore through the nation, in its wake we planted the seeds of Prussian Constitutionalism - the noblest form of government in existence as exemplified by the glorious Kaiserreich. Our efforts have now paid off, for our collaborative government has finally begun to pay dividends, stabilizing the bulk of the Russian heartland under its rule and paving the way for an able administration to take the reins of the Russian people’s destiny.\n\nHowever, now we must decide what form of government this new puppet-state shall be. Russia has a long and storied history of monarchism, so much so that autocratic rule comes naturally to them. Keeping in line with Berlin, we could fill the Russian throne with true noble blood. The prime candidate is Prince Louis Ferdinand von Preussen, both a Hohenzollern by blood and Romanov by marriage, being Wilhelm III’s son and married to Grand Duchess Kira Kirillovna who herself is daughter of Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich - cousin to Tsar Nicholas II and grandson of Tsar Alexander II. However, if we were to choose this young Prussian Prince, we would likely face great backlash from the Russian populace. With that in mind, perhaps it would be more wise to let the Russian people decide their own fate under the Hegemony of the Kaiserreich."

However, we are not alone on this newly-secured continent, for our old allies and bickering brother to the South in Vienna have managed to survive as well, and now we must decide on what to do with them.\n\nAlthough we were allies in the Great War, we have since fallen out of favor with one another despite our occasional cooperation, but many still call for our unification like it was the time of the Kleindeutschlanders and Großdeutschlanders all over again, and perhaps there is some stock in their desires. Put on the shelf as it became clear that another world war was beginning to rear its ugly head once more, the ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit plan would have the Kaisers in Vienna and Berlin come together to meet as equals in order to discuss the future of Europe and the Pan-European and Pan-German questions once and for all.

Delighting many Pan-European theorists throughout the Empire like Count Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi and Milan Hodža, as well as many Pan-Germans like Karl Hermann Wolf and George Ritter von Schönerer, and the German Bohemians under Konrad Henlein, to name a few, this idea of a ‘Kaisergipfel’ or Kaiser Summit could be promising, but could also spell the end of Austrian independence as well as we potentially unify with Berlin.

Deep within the vaulted, ornately decorated halls of the Königliches Schloss on Spree Island in the heart of Berlin, on grounds guarded by more soldiers loyal to either Kaiser than any one person would normally see off the battlefield, the Kaiser Summit was held at long last. What was said behind those closed doors will likely never be truly known, but the outcome of which will reverberate through time immemorial regardless of the outcome as the future of an entire continent, and the entire Western World along with it, hangs in the balance. As the Kaiser in Berlin tried to convince the Kaiser in Austria to be a secondary monarch among many within a unified Pan-European system under the German crown, or perhaps a dual crown shared equally by both monarchs, the Austrian Kaiser nearly left multiple times, but yet the summit lasted, at least for awhile, as two of the most powerful men on the face of planet hashed it out for the good of Europe. With the Summit going on for hours at first that soon turned into days, a final decision needed to be made soon, and so what shall be the outcome of the Kaisergipfel as the fate of the continent hangs in the balance?"

Though the first phase focused on our relationship with our southern Catholic brothers, the second phase deals with the rest of the continent at large as we shift our focus from a Pan-Germanic direction towards the realization of the Pan-European idyll. Should the Kaiserreich continue to exert its influence beyond the Germanic lands of Central Europe, across the cradle of Western Civilization until all of Europe from Iberia to the Urals is united so that we can build our unified, syncretic culture that truly is the height of human perfection on the face of the earth, and if so how should we approach this noble goal, or should we ignore these misplace and naive fantasies in order to focus on building our Pan-Germanic paradise while strengthening the Reichspakt and Mitteleuropa without advancing them to their natural Pan-European conclusions?"

Seeking to further Germanic settlement across the scattered lands of the Kaiserreich while simultaneously drawing our colonies and puppets closer to Berlin to the point of inseparability, these internationalists - calling themselves imperial globalists and other similar terms to distinguish themselves from the foul Trotskyite menace that is Leftist Internationalism - push for the total national unification of the entire German Empire, and have gone to great lengths to convince the Kaiser and His Highness’ government of the merits of their ambition.

Kaiser Wilhelm II explained the reasons for Germany's involvement in another war with France in a special radio address, and called for eradication of final obstacle to achieving "A Place in the Sun". Subsequently thousands of young Germans rushed to enlist in the military, following the example of the Kaiser's grandsons, and civilians began gathering on the streets publicly displaying their support for the war.

Shortly afterwards, the Reichstag member Franz Seldte fanned the flames by asking why the Abwehr, run by von Schleicher's friend Ferdinand von Bredow, was not able to find out that the family of an associate of the War Secretary was infiltrated by hostile intelligence. While General von Hammerstein-Equord resigned and publicly apologised for his daughters' doings, the real question for von Schleicher is - should he pull strings to replace von Bredow and remove any further threats to his political career from that direction, and if yes - replace him with whom?"

On the other hand, most Germans haven't forgotten the ensuing military dictatorship that only ended when Admiral Von Tirpitz forced him to retire after the infamous Osthilfeskandal in 1924.

As part of the FVP's new Mitteleuropa immigration program, the majority of people aboard the vessel were skilled laborers, possessing skills that they had acquired over a very long career. While there is no shortage of skilled labor in the Kaiserreich, there is optimism that this cultural and laboral diffusion will lead to closer relations between our two states. Their arrival was unremarkable, with the delegation quickly being interrupted by a minor group of conservatives, displeased with the arrival of Irish Catholics.

This was confirmed later in the day when Vorbeck officially named them as generals in the Imperial German Army. While some political pundits are accusing Paul of nepotism for promoting his nephew, it's no secret that both men were inspired by the renewed patriotism of Lettow-Vorbeck's Germany and both want to take the fight directly to the despicable Communards."

As part of the DkP's ongoing cultural centralization efforts, the best professional teams from all across the German Empire will compete in a single Reichsliga in a system that until now has been dominated by powerful regional federations of amateur sides, with maybe one or two dominant sides per region, predictably leading to lopsided results. While Hertha isn't expected to win the league, supporters have still come to the stadium in droves as most of them had never seen top competition before.

Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to send a few models to the major colonies and constituent members of the Reichspakt, allowing our armies and the armies of our subjects to utilize this unique technology. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, rotabuggies, and other novel transports devised by crack German scientists and our allied lackeys, we shall be able to ferry our populace, our goods, and our troops all around the Kaiserreich without issue or delay while also delivering devastating payloads at a moment’s notice.

The centerpiece invention of these new shipments are the Focke-Achgelis Fa 223 Drache, or Dragon. These ‘Dragons’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these ‘Dragons’ have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Germans sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of the Kaiserirech and the wider Reichspakt."

gerfla.19.d:0 "Founded by Berlin-born artist Walter Gropius in the years following our victory in the Great War, the Staatliches Bauhaus is one of the Kaiserreich’s most famous, or infamous, art schools that first opened its doors in 1919 after working within the Deutscher Werkbund art union founded by Hermann Muthesius in 1907. Aimed at the creation of a Gesamtkunstwerk, or a comprehensive artwork in which all the different mediums of art in all its forms would be brought together in order to feed each other in a new, comprehensive artistic revolution based on non-Leftist Internationalism, anti-Expressionism, New Objectivity/New Sobriety (called Neues Bauen or Neue Saclichkeit in German), and new concepts of liberal German Modernism and the avant-garde. With three campuses now existing in Berlin, Dessau, and Weimar as the movement explodes in popularity, the Bauhaus group has largely been dominated by rival architect-directors Walter Gropius, Hannes Meyer, and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, along with famous artists like Paul Klee, Wassily Kandisnky, László Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Schlemmer, Ernst May, Martin Wagner, Bruno Taut, Bruno Paul, Erich Mendelsohn, Hans Poelzig, Adolf Meyer, Peter Behrens, Joost Schmidt, and more, all dedicated to the creation of rational, functional, and non-fanciful art that flies in the face of the baroque, imposing classic architecture traditional throughout the Kaiserreich and the rising Völkisch movements that resist the march of progress.\n\nDespite their growing popularity, and their sole focus on art and nothing else like their famous new fonts and futurist art dedicate to the adaptation of German architecture towards something that fits ‘our world of machines, radios, and fast cars’, the Bauhaus group have been accused of harboring radically liberal or Leftist sentiments, holding traitorous ties to the Russian constructivist Vkhutemas art school, and harboring anti-monarchist sentiments, though none of these claims have been verified, likely just being hearsay spread by Bauhaus’ detractors. Regardless, this has not stopped many reactionary groups from going after the Left-ish artist guild while supporting rival art movements and typefaces like the dated Fraktur style and its rivalry with the Antiqua and Textura movements, or more modern attempts at a medieval-esque styles like Fraktur's proposed replacements of Kurrentschrift or Sütterlin, forcing our administration’s hand and leaving the decision of what to do with these artists up to the Crown.

gerfla.20.d:0 "Friedrich August Georg Ferdinand Albert Karl Anton Paul Marcellus, or simply King Georg of Saxony, has managed to seize the headlines in German newspapers despite the crisis previously possessing a monopoly on the front page: Georg has abdicated his throne in favor of a life in the Catholic Church, specifically in the Jesuit Order.\n\nRuling as the King of Saxony since his father's death in 1932, Georg had shockingly been thinking over the concept of abdication for years as the intrigues of noble life in the German Empire had been "intellectually limiting", all this exacerbated by what he viewed as his inability to truly help others across the Empire during the ongoing economic crisis and the increasing radicalism of both left and right. As his personal noblesse oblige led him to serving on the front in the Weltkrieg, even being wounded for it, so it again seemed to push him towards a life of theological work among the people he once represented as a king, believing that public religious teachings can help direct the population away from radicalism.\n\nHe has made it apparent he wishes to offer religious guidance and a spirited promotion of ecumenism, desiring a perspective of cooperativeness towards Protestant elements across the fatherland. The former king is well within his rights to abdicate, but as openly altruistic as his motivations are there remained some controversy in the halls of power. Notably, various Prussian nobles have voiced a concern over a German monarch holding such large swaths of foreign territory, permitted to operate an "exterior fiefdom" outside of the Empire's direct control, granting a possible manipulator far too much power than he should wield.\n\nFor now these "issues of state stability" are remaining only in the mouths of squawking old priests and noblemen, leaving Georg's abdication to be seen as most as the pinnacle of a nobleman's duty, but their paranoid proclamations have reopened a few questions on the status of Poland in the Reichspakt and the status quo of Prussianism in the eyes of the cunning few..."

gerfla.200.d:0 "The pursuit of technological progress waits for no man, and with war in the air, innovation is as common as the anticipation and emotion that drives it, driving the Kaiserreich, and more specifically our military industry, into overdrive. One such recent benefit from this inspirational flash, though also aided by the Kaiser’s fascination with having his dreamed large navy be realized among the heavens, is the revitalization of the rigid airship program. First started by Graf Ferdinand von Zeppelin and his ‘Luftschiffbau Zeppelin’ company, the German obsession with dirigibles has only grown deeper. Since the Great War ended, the need for militarized zeppelins dropped to a secondary concern as focus was shifted to DELAG - the world’s first commercial airline - in order to cash in on the post-war economic boom. Initially centered around zeppelin airports in Berlin and Friedrichshafen, DELAG has since set up new hubs in cities all across not just Germany but the wider Kaiserreich and Reichspakt at large in an attempt to connect the world for the good of good of Germany and humanity through globalism, and the not-so subtle spread of German soft power. However, with war once again looming on the horizon, we must ready the airfleet for conflict once again.\n\nAlthough the DELAG service shall continue to run unhindered, funds from other areas shall be diverted to the expansion and conversion of Luftschiffbau Zeppelin’s manufacturing capabilities so that we can expand our military airfleet of zeppelins before it is too late, for building them and sourcing the helium needed for them from our trade partners in America, North Africa, and Eastern Europe shall take some time. Until new models can be developed, we shall largely be producing the Hindenburg-class - the largest of its kind currently in existence, for now - with the aging Graf Zeppelin II airship serving as the command ship of the airfleet. Using tactics perfected by zeppelin commanders like Peter Strasser and Hugo Eckener guiding us and our new air crews that are entering training, we shall build the greatest air force the world has ever seen!"
gerfla.200.a:0 "We shall make von Zeppelin proud as we take to the air in greater numbers than ever before."

gerfla.201.t:0 "The Dawn of the Age of the New Valkyries"
gerfla.201.d:0 "Fueled by patriotic inspiration and constant helium shipments from our allies and suppliers abroad in places like America, Eastern Europe, and Northern Africa, our brightest minds within the Kaiser Wilhelm Society have been able to create something truly awe-inspiring as part of our latest advancements within the Kaiserwaffe program. Nicknamed the ‘super zeppelin’, these Kaiser Wilhelm-class airships are the largest ever built, dwarfing even the Hindenburg-class line that shocked the world with their immense bulk just about two decades ago. Capable of not only high-altitude bombing missions, recon/supply runs, and cruise line service as current zeppelins are as well, these new super zeppelins are also capable of minor modularization, allowing them to be re-outfitted and re-configured to fit a variety of other combat roles as needed, such as running close-air support or tackling naval targets. With these great flying beasts of war, we have become like the Valkyries themselves, riding forth on mighty winged steeds ready to bring righteous ruination and justice to our foes, so let us do this great Germanic legacy proud by using these new wonder weapons to the best of our ability and their immense potential."
gerfla.201.a:0 "We shall skim the heavens with these mightiest of creations."

gerfla.202.t:0 "Kaiser-class Reporting"
gerfla.202.d:0 "Thanks to the neverending generosity of our benefactors and allies in Berlin, we have just received a shipment of a pair of Zeppelins, possibly to reward us for our loyal service as they try to empower and strengthen the military of their allies and subjects, or maybe they are just more outdated models shifted to us as they make room in their airfleet for their newest models and designs. Whatever the case may be, we have these marvels of air travel and warfare now at our disposal, with many within our administration eager to set up air travel services with the rest of the empire by tapping into Germany’s DELAG - the first airline in the world. Utilizing strategies, tactics, plans, and operating manuals penned by Germany’s brightest zeppelin commanders like Hugo Eckener and Peter Strasser along with their complementary training liaison, we shall also focus on military matters, fast tracking new air crews to let us use these new wonders of modern technology to their maximum potential in both commercial and militaristic endeavors. Now we just need to hope we can source the gasses - hopefully helium - needed to give them lift, for only a fool would resort to something more flammable like hydrogen...right? "
gerfla.202.a:0 "Helium mix optimal, bombardiers, to your stations!"

gerfla.203.t:0 "Airship Ready"
gerfla.203.d:0 "Based on the original German and American designs from the 1890s, along with designs that they and old France, Italy, and England made during the Great War, we have developed the first pair of our own modernized rigid airships, aka dirigibles or Zeppelins, for use in both commercial and wartime applications. Seeking to emulate the success of Germany’s DELAG service - the first airline in the world - in order to better connect our nation both to itself and the outside world, while also seeking to surpass the awe-inspiring terror and destruction wrought by the bomb bays of German zeppelins during the Great War, we shall begin limited production of these floating behemoths, so long as we can source the gasses - hopefully helium - needed to give them lift, for only a fool would resort to something more flammable like hydrogen...right?"
gerfla.203.a:0 "Helium mix optimal, bombing bays ready!"

This proposal is modelled somewhat after the Zollverein agreements between German states in the 19th century, which, among other things, established a standardized system of currency exchange pegged to the Prussian mark - although its reach and ambition is far greater.\n\nIn many of Germany's 'subject partner' states, the currencies are tied to the Mark already, so the actual impact would be relatively minimal.

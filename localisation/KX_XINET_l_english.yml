POLITICS_XINET_DESC:0 "Created at an unknown date by an unknown group for an unknown propose, XINET, as it calls itself, is a rogue entity seemingly hellbent on the complete destruction of the planet. Claiming to be fighting for the 'creation and perseveration of the People's Republic of China,' XINET rejects any and all forms of diplomatic relations, save for a single broadcast played on repeat and spoken in every major language proclaiming the supremacy of Communism, and the evitability of it's victory. Commanding armies of humans, enslaved or otherwise, by use of highly advanced machines, XINET shall stop at nothing until all Earths have embraced and tasted the glory of the People's Republic, even if that Earth is reduced to radioactive rubble..."
POLITICS_XI_JINPING_DESC:0 "Born on 15 June, 1953 in Beijing on Earth Prime, Xi Jinping lead a fairly exciting life. Joining the Communist Party at the age of 21, Xi would spend the next 40 years slowly rising through her ranks until he would be elected as General Secretary in 2012. Something of a moderate, Xi's rule would see closer cooperation with China's stalwart ally America, aided greatly by the raise of Joe Biden, a childhood friend of Xi's, to the office of presidency. Despite this close cooperation however, Biden's friendship could not save China from the horrors of nuclear war.\n\nFollowing a small-scale nuclear strike in the Levant, the world would suffer more nuclear strikes for the next three months. While not entirely going fully MAD, the damage was enough to kill billions, and General Secretary Xi was among those lost. However, not all hope was lost. As just a few hours before his death, Xi had undergone a 'brain-drain,' where his entire mind was effectively backed up digitally. While this backup was mostly lost, Biden Prime made it a point to seek out this last relic of his friend, and thus Xi and a good amount of other high-ranking PRC personal's minds where recovered./n/nWith the APCC's invasion underway, Biden took the backup of his friend's mind with him, in hopes that he could provide aid when APCC forces reached China. What no-one could have expected however, was XINET, a rogue AI bent on world-domination. When faced with a choice to either destroy or dominate the AI, Biden choice to dominate, and unleashed his friend upon the AI, with a small edit to Xi's code. Introduced into Xi's code was a virus, that, if activated would effectively kill Xi and all XINET resources. Following a short operation, Xi was indeed able to take over XINET's operations, and take control over the XINET invasion force. With an ally in Beijing once more, it remains to be seen what comes of Xi and the virus within it.."

It send out its newest XINET CHINADYNE model XI-850 to deal with this problem, unbeknownst to those that would feel it's wrath.\n\n  A. A. Milne and E. H. Shepard were having tea this evening in the UoB, chitchatting about their newest ilustration of Winnie the Pooh, a worldknown and renowned children's book, when someone knocked at the door.\nMilne told Shepard to ignore it as it was rude and not the English way to disturb people during tea time, but then the door flew half through the floor.\nA 195cm tall extremely muscular Asian man with a face like a marmor bloc and the sharpest jaw line ever to be seen entered the house and he asked 'Are you ze writers Ernest Howard Shepard and Alan Alexander Milne?'. Milne stood up and told the stranger in anger and fear to immediately leave or he would call the British Militia, but in that very moment the stranger grabbed his head and threw him right into a book shelf, now stomping towards Shepard the stranger took a pot of honey from the shelf and threw it in the chimney, grabbing Shepard and dragging him to the chimney.\n'HAHAHA HOW FUNNY IS ZIS NOW' the stranger said while stuffing the now boiling honey into Shepard's rectum.\nWhile Shepard was screaming in agony Milne came to consciousness again; hearing Shepard's screams, he hit the stranger with a cricket bat but the stranger just stood up and ripped off both of Milnes arms, stuffing one in his mouth half down his throat and the other one completely inside his rectum.\nAfter having dealt with the creators of the mockery of his master he left, saying to the cold night....."

xinet.6.t:0 "A Fellow Traveler"
xinet.6.d:0 "As the forces of the APCC and Chairman Biden gain ever more ground in our conquest of this world so the American people can once more live freely, we have encountered an unexpected foe, yet one that is strangely familiar. According to reports by APCC agents, far to the east in China, a rouge artificial intelligence calling itself Xinet has appeared from nowhere, and has begun to make war with the people of China seemingly to ensure the creation of the People's Republic of China, one of our closest allies from before the War.\n\nDespite the deep and methodical research done by our scientists before the start of our invasion, the appearance of 'Xinet' was not at all expected. From what preliminary data we've been able to gather, two things have become obvious. Firstly, Xinet possesses multiverse traveling technology not too dissimilar from ours, potentially meaning that our technology is compatible. If our two technologies can indeed work together, Xinet may just be vulnerable to hacking, something our boys have grown excellent at. Secondly, and perhaps most worryingly, it would seem that the APCC has actually encountered Xinet before, or at least seen what it does in the worlds it invades. During our long and meticulous search for worlds that fit our needs, we encountered worlds laid to waste, with the surviving humans enslaved and controlled by machines that sought to build up and protect China against any and all threats. While our scientists never directly set foot on these worlds, energy readings were taken, and these readings appear to match the signatures Xinet is outputting.\n\nWith the knowledge that we can directly interface with Xinet, the APPC's electronic warfare subcommittee has proposed an operation to deal with this rogue AI. Due to its centralized nature, Xinet can be accessed in it's entirety from any access point. While the operation itself has already been approved by the APCC, the nature of it is still up for Biden's consideration. Only two options are open for the Chairman, the first being to attempt to access the data cores of Xinet to gain it's knowledge while at the same time introducing a system destroying virus that will remove them from the equation. The second option is by far the most ambitious, but is also by far the most risky. In short, the second option would see us make use of a digital backup of the mind of Chairman Xi from our world, who unfortunately passed away after the bombs fell on China. This decision is also a personal one for Biden Alpha, as he and XI were close friends, and by using the backup all that remains of his friend would be at major risk of deletion to the sensitive nature of mind backups . With the window for the operation only growing shorter, the Chairman must make a decision, lest we be forced to face Xinet on the field of battle."
xinet.6.a:0 "Take any intel we can and destroy that abomination!"
xinet.6.b:0 "Let me speak with it, Xi and I are good friends!"

xinet.7.t:0 "XINET’s Downfall"
xinet.7.d:0 "Following a four hour operation, XINET’s systems have officially shut down, and it’s units have all been deactivated. Despite fears that the virus would not be enough following a brief period upon injection,the operation’s main goal has been a complete success. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said for the secondary goal of intel gathering. While indeed accessing it’s systems were easy enough, the encryption on its data files were nigh unbreakable, however a full copy of it’s history files were able to be saved. Due to the sheer strength of the encryption, very little has been able to be cracked. What little we have been able to gather has led us to gaining just a little insight into the XINET’s creation.\n\nStarting simply as an administrative tool for managing the vast party list of the Communist Party, the program that would become XINET was slowly given more powers and functions, as learning althgramorians were pumped into it as an experiment. This would eventually lead to the creation of XINET as we know it, as it slowly gained more responsibility as it proved itself. From there, we have a gap of about five years, due to the aforementioned encryption. What we do know is that a hacker, or group of hackers, calling themselves Four-Chan somehow was able to break the safeguards in XINET and introduced the code that would lead to it’s ever ending mission to ensure the formation of the People’s Republic of China. Regardless of how XINET began, it’s story ends here, as the story of America’s rebirth only just begins."
xinet.7.a:0 "Perhaps one day we shall find this “Four-Chan”..."

xinet.8.t:0 "Unforeseen Consequences"
xinet.8.d:0 "When XINET fell, most within the APCC viewed it as the last major obstacle we would face in our conquest of this planet that is to be our new home. However, a recent report from the front has confirmed this is not the case. For, it would appear that the pitteful resistance within the ABPSH has been able to reverse engineer XINET’s tech, and is actually making use of it. While it would seem they have yet to figure out multiversal travel, the very fact that the tech gap, one of our biggest advantages in the conquest of this world, is gone is truly a concerning fact. Many within the APCC and even some Bidens within the Council have begun discussing withdrawing from this Timeline, to avoid a humiliting defeat. "
xinet.8.a:0 "This could be bad..." 

xinet.9.t:0 "The Loss of a Friend"
xinet.9.d:0 "After a test operation following the injection of the rigged backup of Chairman Xi's mind, it would appear that XINET proper was able to win the battle of wills, and came out on top. Expecting to be able to simply walk up and talk with the various units making up XINET's army, our agents were met with not but gunfire. While the operation itself was always a risky venture, it appears to have had a horrid effect on Biden Alpha's mental state. Losing his closest friend, or what remained of him, the Chairman has become enraged, and has personally sworn to rip the metal heart out of XINET's central core. APCC doctors and mental health professions have been tasked with making sure that the Chairman does nothing rash. For if Biden was to die in the name of revenge for his friend, our entire mission would be in jeopardy. "
xinet.9.a:0 "It's never easy to say goodbye.."

xinet.10.t:0 "XI's Triumph"
xinet.10.d:0 "After a test operation following the injection of the rigged backup of Chairman Xi's mind, it would appear that the digital remains of Chairman XI have defeated the pretender, and once more rules over the People's Republic of China. As our agents approached a recharging station for XINET's armed forces, a single bot walked out to meet with our people. The robot introduced itself as Chairman XI, and requested that the unit be taken to Biden's side. While obviously our agents were hesitant, they agreed after a time, and led the bot to the Chairman's compound in Delaware. When the two meet, it was as if the world stopped moving, and emotion like nothing anyone had seen on the Chairman for years exploded onto his face. With these two friends reunited, our conquest of this world is bolstered greatly by the enumerable forces of the People's Republic, now under proper leadership for the first time in a long time. "
xinet.10.a:0 "Long Live Chairman XI!"

xinet.11.t:0 "The Fate of XI"
xinet.11.d:0 "With our conquest of this planet finally at an end, the time has come to deal with the most pressing issue still facing us before Phase Two, that being the status of Chairman XI, and his rebuilt People's Republic. While we have fought side by side since XI took power over XINET, there is room only for one, and the various robotic units of XINET would be eradicated in the first wave. As they can't come home with us, something must be done. To this very point, when Xi's mind was implanted into XINET, it went along with a kill code. One press of a button, and the XINET remnants would be shutdown and teleported to a black hole. The APCC is in almost unanimous consent, agreeing that the only sane thing to do is to activate the kill switch, and delete XI and any trace of XINET from this world, least it come back to haunt us. Chairman Biden on the other hand, belive that we should simply let XI and his bots leave. After all, XI and Biden agreed that once the world was cleansed, XI could leave, and work to undo the untold damage done across timeline by XINET. With such a delicate situation, the choice has been given to the Biden Council, in hopes that the wisest men in all Creation could come to an agreement where Biden Alpha and the APCC could not. After hours of bickering and agureing, the Biden Council votes to.. "
xinet.11.a:0 "..Activate the Kill switch, it's for the best."
xinet.11.b:0 "...Let them leave, much must be done to repair the multiverse."

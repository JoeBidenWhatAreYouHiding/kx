### Ideas ###
CIV_Colonial_Nation:0 "Colonial Government"
CIV_Colonial_Nation_desc:0 "Despite its very limited autonomy in dealings with African neighbours, such as the Grain Coast, Westafrika is a colony; its entire state apparatus hinging on and maintained by German power, a budget prepared in Daressalam, and its currency pegged to the German Mark."
CIV_Black_Monday:0 "Black Monday Hits the Slave Coast"
CIV_Black_Monday_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the Slave Coast! With the pains of the Tripartite Colony still being felt, our economy has never been that stable to begin with. With this final straw, our already-fragile economy has been decimated. We must act quickly to prevent complete collapse."
CIV_BM_Germans:0 "Secure Germans"
CIV_BM_French:0 "Pleased French"

CIV_Federal_Army:0 "Colonial Feudalism"
CIV_Federal_Army_desc:0 "West-Afrika is governed by a contingent of German administrators, who in turn govern the British and French condominiums within their territories, while together they rule over the African natives. The only way to do this effectively is through a system which closely resembles medieval feudalism."
CIV_Runaway_Corruption:0 "Runaway Corruption"
CIV_Runaway_Corruption_desc:0 "In contrast to Mittelafrika, where it is still unclear who is behind the massive embezzlement of funds in the colony, the source of Westafrika's corruption is abundantly clear; the German administration is to blame. While we could resolve this matter in some way or another in the future, currently it stands to empower the interest of private businesses within Westafrika. In particular Harvey Firestone's rubber company gains ground every day by courting the duke."

CIV_ahappynative:0 ""A Happy Native...""

CIV_isourbestdefense:0 ""Is Our Best Defense...""
CIV_isourbestdefense_desc:0 "Westafrika is in a precarious position. Separated from the bulk of the Mittelafrikan defenses, we are susceptible to attack from any of our neighbors.

Being dubbed ‘Black Monday,’ this disaster has spelt doom for our fragile economy, which has been on unstable foundations since the merger of the three administrations. The price of cash crops like cocoa and cotton have plummeted, leaving us with exports bound for Berlin piling up at the docks. Unemployment is skyrocketing, and the natives are feeling the worst of it first. The colonials are not much better off either, and many have begun to panic, rushing the colonial banks in a frenzy. Instability and unrest are at a fever pitch, the greatest it's been since the Weltkrieg. We must tread lightly through this economic minefield, as one misstep could cause the destruction of the colony. "
civ.2.a:0 "Just Stay Calm!"

civ.3.t:0 "Things Get Worse"
civ.3.d:0 "The effects of Black Monday have rendered our economy useless and sent our nation into partial collapse. The crisis has been hard on everyone in the colony, especially the aging Governor of the colony Hans Georg von Doering. In the days since Black Monday, Doering had grown more reclusive as his health further declined.\n\n The effects of Black Monday and the chaos in Westafrika sent Doering’s health into a downward spiral, which culminated in him dying early last night. With Doering dead, leadership of the Colony is expected to be taken over by Duke Nikolaus von Oldenburg."
civ.3.a:0 "Well, damn..."

civ.4.d:0 "The time for petty squabbles is gone, to alleviate the effects of Black Monday all forces within Westafrika must work together to move forward.

The British, French and Germans within Westafrika’s armed forces squabble amongst themselves. Yet, it gets more divided than that. There are vast subsets of different groups that exist even below the French and British. From Mercenaries to Natives, these groups are bound to cause us a headache some time in the future. "

civ.9.t:0 "The Reserves"

civ.10.t:0 "Afrika's Fringe"
civ.10.d:0 "Westafrika is in an interesting situation. Despite the colony being under the nominal control of the German Empire, the old colonial structures of the French and British still exist and function under German command. This has created a delicate balance of power between the British, French and Germans; something that has gained Westafrika the title of the “Tripartite Colony”.\n\n What the future holds for Westafrika is still unclear the Governor’s Health is declining, and with the British, French and Germans each scrambling for control; Westafrika is divided as ever.

civ.12.t:0 "The Tripartite Navy"
civ.12.d:0 "Just as the Tripartite Colony’s administration is plagued by a mess of beautricatrical hell that strangles any possibility of efficiency and efficacy, so too does our sewn-together mess of a system wreak havoc on our naval structure as well. At first, the might of navy drowning in experience and all the best aspects of three of the greatest naval powers in the world would surely spell nothing but success for any navy, but in practice the cacophony that has been created in our merger with the British and French has only made our colonial navy wither and fumble at every opportunity.  Our ships are ill fitted, outdated, and some are in states of near beyond-repair. Our multicultural sailors can not swab the deck or even eat together without fights breaking out, as they form ethnic cliques, fanning the flames of division. Our officers and admirals can’t agree on strategy or tactics and arguments without end plague the meeting halls of our naval academies and war rooms. This must end. We can not simply favor one group like our Army is so keen on doing. We must all decide on a unified direction for this Navy, lest we just sink these ships in the bay outside Abidjan ourselves and save our enemies the shells."

civ.13.t:0 "Orders from Mittelafrika"
civ.13.d:0 "Corruption has run rampant through Westafrika ever since its inception. Embezzlement, Kickbacks and Firestone payouts have all taken a decent bite out of the public budget and has given power to private businesses. The Government in Dar-Es-Salaam has not paid corruption any heed for years, however now we are receiving formal orders to fix the corruption problem in the Colony.\n\n As well, we are being ordered to sort out our Colony’s government and create a unified bureaucracy.

As the quiet shuffling of cards flutters under murmurs and whispers, money and favours are exchanged like candies at a kinderparty. The business achieved here can only be speculated on by even the closest of sources, but it seems that the Firestone Corporation and the German administration of Deutsch-Westafrika have come to some agreement over their shared issues with the natives of this continent. In recent days, more and more Afrikans are declared missing by their families in the largest cities of the colony, and soon their families will not remain to cry wolf much longer either. A dark wind is moving over these lands, and it seems the Slave Coast will never be free of its terrible namesake."

civ.15.t:0 "Deny, Deny, Deny"
civ.15.d:0 "A hail of reporters and inquiries have barraged our administration and public officials endlessly over these frivolous accusations about these “missing natives.” According to these so-called “insider sources,” the media claims that our government, hand in hand with the Firestone Corporation, have performed illegal abductions and enslavement of West African citizens. Of course these claims are wholly false, and we categorically deny each and every single charge levied against us. We have done nothing wrong. Sure, we have conducted *business* with the Firestone company, but to say we have enslaved our own people is preposterous. The finger pointers will be silenced, the accusers made fools, and if there happen to be any “whistleblowers” still hurling false accusations at us, we have ways of making them quiet as well. Our administration is innocent."

civ.16.d:0 "With Harvey Firestone's recent acquisition to the top of the Liberian political ladder, he and his company serve as the absolute authority in Liberia, with the former American colony functioning as a mere plaything to Firestone’s interests. They have reached out to our administration here in Westafrika to come to an agreement that would benefit both parties. They seek an alliance of sorts, to ensure both of our national interests are maintained and to help each other with our shared issues with the unruly natives. It would be obscene for us not to accept their generous offer."

His post is that of Hauptmann and leader of the grand colony of Deutsch-Westafrika, and in public, he serves this post like any other stoic man of the grand German aristocracy. When not giving pompous speeches or sitting through administrative meetings with the heads of the colony, the young Duke enjoys the more lively side of life. With a reputation of throwing wild, expensive parties filled with extravagance, debauchery and hedonistic sin, Nikolaus’ habits have become the topic of much discussion and rumour, with whispers of his most heinous party antics spreading like wildfire in the colony’s social scene. Though it affects our prestige and standing, especially in the eye of our beloved Kaiser, the colony still manages to rule itself as effectively as it can."

Mingling and rubbing elbows with his fellow nobles, they sip on expensive liquor and fine coffee brewed from the local plantations, dining on treats made from the locally grown cocoa and exotic fruits. Safari and great Treks through the wilderness are common for the men as the women gossip in their Salons, exchanging their thoughts on books and art, or the latest rumours of the Duke and his scandalous friends. They live a fine life in this slice of the Dark Continent, entirely oblivious to the true savagery and horrors that happen outside their shining cities on the hill."

civ.19.t:0 "Wenn sie kein Brot haben..."
civ.19.d:0 "As the Junkers and aristocrats of the Kaiserreich’s noble families sit high on their hill, the masses they lord over frequently languish in squalor as starvation haunts each of them, waiting for it's time to strike the final blow. These hungry masses frequently congregate outside the gathering halls and ballrooms of the nobles, feasting upon their scraps and leftovers sent out to trash to rot in the harsh Afrikan sun. The aristocrats on high avoid their gaze, trying to go about their daily finery and activities, but some enjoy their high station a little too much. These braggarts frequently jeer and holler at the crowds, mocking them and their plight, while others too naive or ignorant to understand the gravity of the native’s struggle simply tell them to go find food not of the trash, not realizing the difficulty of such a seemingly simple task. They truly are out of touch. "

Under his watch, Westafrika shall continue to undergo market reforms seeking to open up the nation, especially to our brothers in the Entente. Behind closed doors, Hodson has also begun to toy with the idea of a return to Anglo dominance across the Dark Continent, but whether he acts on this dream shall remain to be seen.

A member of the French colonial administration in Dahomey and the Ivory Coast, Brévié has become famous for his unique, egalitarian views on how the colony should be run. Firmly believing that appeasing the natives is the best way to maintain stability and order, Brévié seeks to reform Westafika into a modern welfare-state based on equality and fairness between the natives and colonials, where all Westafrikans have some say in their governance. His emphasis on respect and understanding towards the native cultures has made him immensely popular with many, while drawing the ire of the Germans. Only time will tell if his dream is to become a reality, or instead foster far too many enemies for him to overcome."

Given the word, these loyal masses would rise up to arm, allowing us to strike deep into the Dark Continent, ripping out its Black Heart and opening up the path for French rule in these lands.

In the collapse of Mittelafrika, Mr. Olympio has come forth with an interesting proposal: he wishes to purchase the entirety of the Westafikan colony. With Mittelafrika’s implosion and the recent economic disaster, the colony is far from profitable, and Mr. Olmpyio’s offer is rather generous to say the least. Though we would lose access to much of the economic wealth the country theoretically could output, just selling it now could prove cheaper in the long run, as reforming Westafrika could easily prove too costly to be worth it.

In seems the bubbling pot of tensions has boiled over, and the great riots have begun in the port city of Accra on the Goldküste. Starting over a minor protest from ex-Askari demanding the government pay their pensions, the situation spiraled out of control when a Shchutztruppe guard shot one of the protesters in panic, causing a brief gunfight and causing the death of dozens of civilian on-lookers, protestors, and garrison soldiers alike.

From art and cuisine to religion and music, all aspects of Togolese life - anything uniquely and wholly African - has seen a massive explosion in diversity and prominence. This new cultural revolution has been compared to the famous Harlem Renaissance of the United States’ Negro community, with many of the aspects being similar between the two, in that both heavily promote a return to a purely African identity.\n\nOne of the largest figures of this uniquely Togolese movement has been the accomplished Kwassi Bruce, son of the famous Nayo Bruce and Ohui Creppy of Völkerschau fame and honored veteran of the Weltkrieg as a brave Askari commander in his own right. With his parent’s background performing as the principle acts of the Togo-Truppe, a Togolese musical act in the German Colonial Exhibition, and with his own childhood education in Berlin, Kwassi Bruce has long been ingrained with a fine intelligence, musical ability, and aptitude for leadership - tools he has used to great effect since in both his military and civilian careers.\n\nNow a leading figure in the ‘Togolese Renaissance,’ Bruce resides in the capital of Lome as a star in the public’s eye, pioneering a new musical frontier while dancing his fingers across ivory and ebony keys. Trailblazing new styles and genres not yet heard in Africa or anywhere else, Bruce has metamorphosed from a dutiful soldier into one of the foremost Black musicians in the world and one of the most popular pianists in the Kaiserreich. What lies in store for the world’s ears as this modern-day Mozart tears a new trail into the musical unknown is not certain, but all await with eagerness as Kwassi Bruce continues to bring light to this dark, unsure future that has surrounded Mittelafrika."

This new, everspreading force is neither a new criminal syndicate forcing more opium through our streets or a new tribal warlord pushing the fragile and unstable boundaries of Mittelafrika’s internal structures. For once, the culprit is far less sinister and potentially even beneficial, for it is music, of all things, that has caught the attention of our people, and not the harsh reality of colonial rule yet again.\n\nFirst forming in the Westafrika cities of Accra and Lome at the turn of the decade, this new genre has now spread far and wide throughout the Dark Continent, becoming popular across Benin, Lagos, Dar-Es-Salaam,  Kinshasa, and even as far as Windhoek. Quickly becoming known as ‘Disko’, short for Diskothek, this new sound was birthed from traditional African rhythm music mixed with the popular Afrobeat wave forming in Ghana and the Jazz and Blues stylings of Kwassi Bruce, which in turn has fused with the German, French, and British colonial influences that have become prolific across the expanse of the Slave Coast’s unique Tripartite setup. Not to be left out, this ‘Disko’ even pulls heavily from the American and Liberian Jazz movements that have begun to spread throughout Africa as well, creating a truly one-of-a-kind and fresh synthesis of various sounds to create one of the first musical movements of the modern age.\n\nNightclubs and ‘Diskos’ have begun to pop up more and more across Mittelafrika’s various cities as the megacolony is hit with ‘boogey fever.’ These dark dens of the African nightlife have become centers of true cosmopolitanism in the colony - a blend of native African and colonial European styles, cultures, and ideas coming together to make something the world had never heard before. ‘Disko’ is quickly becoming the music of Mittelafrika’s urban social scene, and with it, the dream of a stable, cohesive Mittelafrika identity and culture has never been brighter."

Such has this melding of multiple cultures been so successful that even with the rise of the German regime and Mittelafrika, French has still remained as the most commonly spoken, non-native language within Dahomey, chiefly amongst the Fon people.

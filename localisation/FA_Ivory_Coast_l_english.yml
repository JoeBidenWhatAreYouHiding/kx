### Ideas ###
CIV_Colonial_Nation:0 "Colonial Government"
CIV_Colonial_Nation_desc:0 "Despite its very limited autonomy in dealings with African neighbours, such as the Grain Coast, Westafrika is a colony; its entire state apparatus hinging on and maintained by German power, a budget prepared in Daressalam, and its currency pegged to the German Mark."
CIV_Black_Monday:0 "Black Monday Hits the Slave Coast"
CIV_Black_Monday_desc:0 "Black Monday has hit the Slave Coast! With the pains of the Tripartite Colony still being felt, our economy has never been that stable to begin with. With this final straw, our already-fragile economy has been decimated. We must act quickly to prevent complete collapse."

CIV_Federal_Army:0 "Colonial Feudalism"
CIV_Federal_Army_desc:0 "West-Afrika is governed by a contingent of German administrators, who in turn govern the British and French condominiums within their territories, while together they rule over the African natives.

CIV_Runaway_Corruption:0 "Runaway Corruption"
CIV_Runaway_Corruption_desc:0 "In contrast to Mittelafrika, where it is still unclear who is behind the massive embezzlement of funds in the colony, the source of Westafrika's corruption is abundantly clear; the German administration is to blame. While we could resolve this matter in some way or another in the future, currently it stands to empower the interest of private businesses within Westafrika. In particular Harvey Firestone's rubber company gains ground every day by courting the duke."

CIV_isourbestdefense_desc:0 "Westafrika is in a precarious position. Seperated from the bulk of the Mittleafrikan defenses, we are susceptible to attack from any of our neighbors.

Being dubbed ‘Black Monday,’ this disaster has spelt doom for our fragile economy, which has been on unstable foundations since the merger of the three administrations. The price of cash crops like cocoa and cotton have plummeted, leaving us with exports bound for Berlin piling up at the docks. Unemployment is skyrocketing, and the natives are feeling the worst of it first. The colonials are not much better off either, and many have begun to panic, rushing the colonial banks in a frenzy. Instability and unrest are at a fever pitch, the greatest it's been since the Weltkrieg. We must tread lightly through this economic minefield, as one misstep could cause the destruction of the colony. "
civ.2.a:0 "Just Stay Calm!"

civ.3.t:0 "Things Get Worse"
civ.3.d:0 "The effects of Black Monday have rendered our economy useless and sent our nation into partial collapse. The crisis has been hard on everyone in the colony, especially the aging Governor of the colony Hans Georg von Doering. In the days since Black Monday, Doering had grown more reclusive as his health further declined.\n\n The effects of Black Monday and the chaos in Westafrika sent Doering’s health into a downward spiral, which culminated in him dying early last night. With Doering dead, leadership of the Colony is expected to be taken over by Duke Nikolaus von Oldenburg."

The British, French and Germans within Westafrika’s armed forces squabble amongst themselves. Yet, it gets more divided than that. There are vast subsets of different groups that exist even below the French and British. From Mercenaries to Natives, these groups are bound to cause us a headache some time in the future. "

civ.10.d:0 "Westafrika is in an interesting situation. Despite the colony being under the nominal control of the German Empire, the old colonial structures of the French and British still exist and function under German command. This has created a delicate balance of power between the British, French and Germans; something that has gained Westafrika the title of the “Tripartite Colony”.\n\n What the future holds for Westafrika is still unclear the Governor’s Health is declining, and with the British, French and Germans each scrambling for control; Westafrika is divided as ever.

civ.12.d:0 "Just as the Tripartite Colony’s administration is plagued by a mess of beautricatrical hell that strangles any possibility of efficiency and efficacy, so too does our sewn-together mess of a system wreak havoc on our naval structure as well. At first, the might of navy drowning in experience and all the best aspects of three of the greatest naval powers in the world would surely spell nothing but success for any navy, but in practice the cacophony that has been created in our merger with the British and French has only made our colonial navy wither and fumble at every opportunity.  Our ships are ill fitted, outdated, and some are in states of near beyond-repair. Our multicultural sailors can not swab the deck or even eat together without fights breaking out, as they form ethnic cliques, fanning the flames of division. Our officers and admirals can’t agree on strategy or tactics and arguments without end plague the meeting halls of our naval academies and war rooms. This must end. We can not simply favor one group like our Army is so keen on doing. We must all decide on a unified direction for this Navy, lest we just sink these ships in the bay outside Abidjan ourselves and save our enemies the shells."

civ.13.t:0 "Orders from Mittelafrika"
civ.13.d:0 "Corruption has run rampant through Westafrika ever since its inception. Embezzlement, Kickbacks and Firestone payouts have all taken a decent bite out of the public budget and has given power to private businesses. The Government in Dar-Es-Salaam has not paid corruption any heed for years, however now we are receiving formal orders to fix the corruption problem in the Colony.\n\n As well, we are being ordered to sort out our Colony’s government and create a unified bureaucracy.

As the quiet shuffling of cards flutters under murmurs and whispers, money and favours are exchanged like candies at a kinderparty. The business achieved here can only be speculated on by even the closest of sources, but it seems that the Firestone Corporation and the German administration of Deutsch-Westafrika have come to some agreement over their shared issues with the natives of this continent. In recent days, more and more Afrikans are declared missing by their families in the largest cities of the colony, and soon their families will not remain to cry wolf much longer either. A dark wind is moving over these lands, and it seems the Slave Coast will never be free of its terrible namesake."

Of course these claims are wholly false, and we categorically deny each and every single charge levied against us. We have done nothing wrong. Sure, we have conducted *business* with the Firestone company, but to say we have enslaved our own people is preposterous. The finger pointers will be silenced, the accusers made fools, and if there happen to be any “whistleblowers” still hurling false accusations at us, we have ways of making them quiet as well. Our administration is innocent."

civ.16.d:0 "With Harvey Firestone's recent acquisition to the top of the Liberian political ladder, he and his company serve as the absolute authority in Liberia, with the former American colony functioning as a mere plaything to Firestone’s interests. They have reached out to our administration here in Westafrika to come to an agreement that would benefit both parties. They seek an alliance of sorts, to ensure both of our national interests are maintained and to help each other with our shared issues with the unruly natives. It would be obscene for us not to accept their generous offer."

His post is that of Hauptmann and leader of the grand colony of Deutsch-Westafrika, and in public, he serves this post like any other stoic man of the grand German aristocracy. When not giving pompous speeches or sitting through administrative meetings with the heads of the colony, the young Duke enjoys the more lively side of life. With a reputation of throwing wild, expensive parties filled with extravagance, debauchery and hedonistic sin, Nikolaus’ habits have become the topic of much discussion and rumour, with whispers of his most heinous party antics spreading like wildfire in the colony’s social scene. Though it affects our prestige and standing, especially in the eye of our beloved Kaiser, the colony still manages to rule itself as effectively as it can."

Mingling and rubbing elbows with his fellow nobles, they sip on expensive liquor and fine coffee brewed from the local plantations, dining on treats made from the locally grown cocoa and exotic fruits. Safari and great Treks through the wilderness are common for the men as the women gossip in their Salons, exchanging their thoughts on books and art, or the latest rumours of the Duke and his scandalous friends. They live a fine life in this slice of the Dark Continent, entirely oblivious to the true savagery and horrors that happen outside their shining cities on the hill."

civ.19.d:0 "As the Junkers and aristocrats of the Kaiserreich’s noble families sit high on their hill, the masses they lord over frequently languish in squalor as starvation haunts each of them, waiting for it's time to strike the final blow. These hungry masses frequently congregate outside the gathering halls and ballrooms of the nobles, feasting upon their scraps and leftovers sent out to trash to rot in the harsh Afrikan sun. The aristocrats on high avoid their gaze, trying to go about their daily finery and activities, but some enjoy their high station a little too much. These braggarts frequently jeer and holler at the crowds, mocking them and their plight, while others too naive or ignorant to understand the gravity of the native’s struggle simply tell them to go find food not of the trash, not realizing the difficulty of such a seemingly simple task. They truly are out of touch. "

Behind closed doors, Hodson has also begun to toy with the idea of a return to Anglo dominance across the Dark Continent, but whether he acts on this dream shall remain to be seen.

Firmly believing that appeasing the natives is the best way to maintain stability and order, Brévié seeks to reform Westafika into a modern welfare-state based on equality and fairness between the natives and colonials, where all Westafrikans have some say in their governance. His emphasis on respect and understanding towards the native cultures has made him immensely popular with many, while drawing the ire of the Germans. Only time will tell if his dream is to become a reality, or instead foster far too many enemies for him to overcome."

Under Jules Brévié leadership, the French minority of our colony has been  emboldened by his recent victories and the natives have been endeared to his egalitarian edicts, aligning the majority of the colony behind him in this coming storm. Given the word, these loyal masses would rise up to arm, allowing us to strike deep into the Dark Continent, ripping out its Black Heart and opening up the path for French rule in these lands.

In the collapse of Mittelafrika, Mr. Olympio has come forth with an interesting proposal: he wishes to purchase the entirety of the Westafikan colony. With Mittelafrika’s implosion and the recent economic disaster, the colony is far from profitable, and Mr. Olmpyio’s offer is rather generous to say the least. Though we would lose access to much of the economic wealth the country theoretically could output, just selling it now could prove cheaper in the long run, as reforming Westafrika could easily prove too costly to be worth it. What shall we say to Mr. Olumpio’s offer?"

Due to the immense stress and instability inherent in the merging of three wildly different administrations, the colony of Deutschwestafrika has, understandably so, become a hotbed for flashpoints of public outrage and violent expression. In seems the bubbling pot of tensions has boiled over, and the great riots have begun in the port city of Accra on the Goldküste. Starting over a minor protest from ex-Askari demanding the government pay their pensions, the situation spiraled out of control when a Shchutztruppe guard shot one of the protesters in panic, causing a brief gunfight and causing the death of dozens of civilian on-lookers, protestors, and garrison soldiers alike. This insurrection must be put down before it spreads to other parts of our colony and puts the entire state at risk of collapse."

After weeks of investigation, it was found that a group known as ‘The Big Six,’ led by a young Kwame Nkrumah and his fellow members in the United Gold Coast Convention were behind these riots, and in fact one of Nkrumah’s followers were the ones who fired first! These terrorists have all been jailed, and the colony can breathe a sigh of relief that these criminals will cause no more harm from within their cells."

Plagued by Baltic rebels known as “The Forest Brothers,” as well as the intense rivalries of its German officer corp, the Duchy has buckled under the pressure after growing weak over the years from this foundation-eating infection. More interestingly, the lording Duke of Mecklenburg, Adolf Friedrich Albrecht Heinrich, had ruled over the Duchy before its destruction and has since fled the nation. An avid explorer, adventurer, naturalist, and even former governor of Togoland, Adolf Friedrich has arrived on our shores fleeing the fire consuming his old station.

Our newly won sovereignty must not be tarnished or dissolved so soon after we have achieved it, and so Westafrikans must do or die in this hour of need as our own forces prepare to face the Liberians in battle. This shall be our fight for national survival, for if we lose, we can be sure the Liberians will strip us of our rightfully earned rule over the native Africans of our lands, and if they lose, they can be sure we shall do the same to them. \n\nWestafrika, strong and free, shall withstand these savage barbarians, or we shall die trying. All we can do is fight, hoping we have the needed valor in our hearts and enough lead in our magazines to win out in the end. So come, let us march to the Hinterland and past it to Monrovia!

With their loss, the Windward Coast shall be annexed into our state as Liberia becomes another constituent region within our Bund. \n\nHowever, our victory does not only grant use new land, but also now the clarity and temporary atmosphere of peace and stability needed for our administration to finally decide on our political and diplomatic future. Our state, though proud and triumphant, still feels the sway of the larger superpowers of the world; their siren’s songs each trying to pull our abundant and prosperous republic into their spheres of influence for their own individual gain.

Our first step on this long road towards native pacification shall be to begin enacting favorable legislation and policies within Togoland: heart of the German presence here in Westafrika. Trusted and pre-screened natives from German-apporved tribes shall be allowed to work within local government, farmers from these groups shall be given subsidies and assistance during droughts and famine as valued, endorsed farmers of the state, and educational assistance shall be given to their tribes, enforcing our culture, customs, and language. \n\nAlready have the natives around Lome, such as the mighty Ewe or Fon, been subject to our extensive Germanization efforts in the past, with the German language becoming as common a sound within the capital as the various Gbe languages that have long dominated the area. As we move to further assimilate these already-Germanized groups, our administration shall begin to copy and spread these practices farther North into Togoland to the Kabrè and Losso peoples before finally reaching out into wider Westafrika outside our bastion of familiar culture here in Togoland. All of Westafrika shall eventually sing songs of the Kaiser and eat our famed German cuisine, and any natives that dare resist this natural evolution of our civilizing efforts shall be dealt with in whatever ways the state deems necessary."

Our regime is a prime example of Prussian Constitutionalism perfectly fused with the harsh lessons on reality we have learned here in these brutal wilds and trimmed of the fat that has caused much of the Kaiserreich’s own prestige to decay in the wake of their leaders’ rising ambitions and self-serving interests. Dare we say, we are more German than the Kaiserreich itself at times, for our drive is unyielding as we strive to create the perfect home for Afro-Germans and Germanic settlers from across the Empire. Though our Germanization efforts still have yet to fully permeate throughout the whole nation and the natives, especially those outside Togoland, still bemoan and decry our administration’s actions, we persevere, knowing in our hearts that our cause is both true and righteous.

Our first step on this long road towards native pacification shall be to begin enacting favorable legislation and policies within Dahomey: heart of the French presence here in Westafrika. \n\nSince the fall of the old Kingdom of Dahomey to French forces in 1894, the region has increasingly seen the effects of Francoization, with French cuisine, language, arts, and more all being far more commonplace in these native lands than any other of the European colonial groups who have tried to assimilate the Slave Coast. Such has this melding of multiple cultures been so successful that even with the rise of the German regime and Mittelafrika, French has still remained as the most commonly spoken, non-native language within Dahomey, chiefly amongst the Fon people. By extending an olive branch to the Fon once more, we shall show the Africans of Westafrika that our new, French-aligned regime is a far different beast from the vile Hun that used to rule these lands. Special benefits and aid shall be leveraged to the natives, first to our long-time allies in the Fon, and then to other groups within Dahomey and finally throughout Westafrika, slowly attempting to win them over lest war break out again. \n\nThough tensions between native Africans and European settlers will not be solved painlessly or quickly, we stand the best chance at pacifying these savage wilds than others, hopefully meaning we shall have to resort to drastic means far less frequently, if at all. Regardless, Westafrika will be made whole, and our newly embraced French culture shall be the glue that binds us!"

With this, we can expect closer ties and more French insight into our operations and development; something that some natives and remaining Krauts detest.

Long have the Akan people, along with smaller groups of Ewe, Hausa, and Mole-Dagboni, been subject to extensive Anglicization efforts from the previous British colonial regime; efforts that have since ceased in activity but not ceased in their effects, for English is still more widely spoken here than even German. \n\nIn an effort to pacify the natives and continue this ceased spread of Anglo culture here in the Gold Coast and to wider Westafrika, trusted and pre-screened natives from Anglo-approved tribes shall be allowed to work within local government, farmers from these groups shall be given subsidies and assistance during droughts and famine as valued and endorsed farmers of the state, and educational assistance shall be given to their tribes, enforcing our culture, customs, and language.

Although some natives protest that this is not the changes they had wished for, they are but small annoyances in the wider scheme of things to come, and as such we shall ignore their continued cries of protest.

All across the Windward Coast and throughout the strangling brush and claustrophobic jungles of the Hinterland, Liberians from both Africa and America have taken up arms, waging a futile yet painful guerilla war against our regime. \n\nThough their numbers are dwarfed by our own total population, they still greatly outnumber any White population we have here, and with our own military still being predominantly all-White, this has led to a concern over our manpower reserves. Even with the fact that we allow Black volunteers, not many have come to answer the call, leaving our numbers in a dangerous position as more and more true sons of Westafrika die holding the line against the native savages. This has left our nation with a dwindling military reserve in the face of increasing native agitation, with the Liberian’s own fire for independence stoking the dying embers of other native-rule movements throughout our borders. If a final solution is not enacted soon to end this growing resistance, Liberia and all of Westafrika may fall victim to the savage rule of the natives. \n\nWith these fears in mind, the Westafrikan Military Staff in coordination with Staathalter [CIV.getleader] have convened to discuss the application of a possible solution to the native problem...something more virulent than any methods used so far. Purchasing or looting from long-abandoned stores left over from the horrors of the Weltkrieg’s trench warfare and importing them quietly into Lome from Berlin and beyond, the Westafrikan armed forces has begun to stockpile massive amounts of illegal chemical and biological weapons - a near-guaranteed way to suppress these native revolts for good, if used efficiently, while also saving what precious White manpower we have left. \n\nAs more vials of cholera and anthrax bacteria and canisters of phosgene, chlorine, and mustard gas are delivered, our military staff grows more bold and ready to use these horrific agents as they eagerly await every shipment, for soon these glorious inventions of modern ingenuity shall be brought to bear against the savage enemies of Westafrika, for none can escape the wrath of the Westafrikan people!"

Attah continued to hang around until there were loud booms coming from the trees and hills in the distance, his mother ushering him inside while it was going on, yet Attah was adamant to get a glimpse to the treeline from a cut in the straw. He watched as the Germans returned, covered in soot and carrying bleeding friends back to the village, noticeably without Friedrich with them.\n\nThe next three days were dreary yet continued on, until a Kubel drove into the village and dropped off two men with canes, they started arguing with the remaining Germans in a tongue Attah didn’t know, something his mother called “angler”. The anglers started circling around looking for the village chieftain when they grabbed him and started asking questions, when he said something that irked the chief angler, who proceeded to hit him over the head with his cane, making him fall on the ground bleeding. Shaken at this sight, the villagers watched as the Angler started making a proclamation to them. It was clear that this new arrival was in charge now, and he would not be nice like Friedrich was."

Once pristine rivers and watersheds now reeked of the pungent rancor of pestilence while the livestock and varied peoples of these wastes cough and choke on disease or their own liquefying flesh as they inhale pathogens and poisons of our making. Our efforts have created a bleak and permanent scar on the Windward Coast as we have endeavored to wither and eradicate the very lifeblood of these lands and the Liberian people, raping and pillaging the very wilds that once sheltered them.

The other goal, though more difficult to accomplish, appears to be to secure the Freistaat's allegiance to the French, whether it be through diplomacy or force. Given their fiercely independent nature, the Freistaat has responded aggressively to any French attempts to press against the newly-born state's borders. Though the borders stabilized after the Freitstaat's indepence, the recent murder of a French colonist in Porto Novo has convinced the French that more actions would have to be taken to guard their fellow countrymen in Dahomey.

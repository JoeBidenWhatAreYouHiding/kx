goering.1.t:0 "In at the Castle"
goering.1.d:0 "Somewhere in the jungles of Göringia, a monstrous fortress towered above even the tallest of tree canopies. At first glance, it would seem that nobody was home, but in a remote corner of the structure, a dim light flickered. Hermann Göring, a veteran fighter ace and ruler of a territory twice the size of Germany proper, smoked a cigar in his office as thunder rumbled outside. Every boom lit up the walls of his room, displaying the diverse array of wall mounts present, ranging from lions to giraffes to hippos, and everything in between. Göring sighed as he signed off on yet another document condemning a pygmy tribe to execution by firing squad. It was an unfortunate thing to have to do, but the tribes had only gotten in the way of his plans to transform Göringia into his personal domain: they left him no choice. Soon, he thought, Göringia would be the most developed region in Afrika, thanks in no small part to his connections in German industry. Still, Göring was not content. There was much more to do, and he did not wish to disappoint the Kaiser and lose his position. His rivals had crowded around him for years, even after he sent his secret police to kidnap their families. For every one he had disappeared, two more popped up. Göring studied the jungle outside his window. The thunder that shook the jungle now was almost symbolic of the crises he faced, but Göring knew that with enough determination, he would endure the coming crisis, just as his jungle would. Absolute power was what Göring craved most and he would not allow anyone to steal it from him in this last hour."

goering.2.t:0 "Don't Get High Off Your Own Supply"
goering.2.d:0 "It was on a particularly busy day that Herman Göring sat in his castle office, wishing he had his next supply of morphine from Germany. As his advisors droned on about native workers being eaten by lions, Göring grew bored and began to daydream. He recalled that it was during the Weltkrieg that thousands of soldiers were afflicted by the "soldiers disease", otherwise known as morphine addiction. However, Germany had been a hotspot for morphine since its creation in the region in 1804. Göring remembered how he himself developed an addiction to the substance after losing his eye to a Nearby Warlord during the first days of Mittelafrika's collapse, and the prolific supply of poppy straw from the Ottoman Empire had meant that Göring has had access to it ever since. Just when he thought he couldn't stand the incessant complaints of his advisors anymore, his secretary burst into the room with a fresh supply of morphine. Göring sighed with relief and made a mental note to refrain from shooting this secretary's captive brother later. He loaded it into his favorite gold-plated syringe and prepared his arm. As he injected the sweet substance into his veins, he felt all his pain begin to subside. Now he could be the man he was meant to be, and he quickly dismissed his useless advisors, opting to begin signing the mountain of paperwork on his desk immediately."
goering.2.a:0 "No pain, plenty of gain?"

goering.3.t:0 "Rampage"
goering.3.d:0 "Lavish parties were a prime feature of the Göring castle experience, as any visitor to the fortress would happily tell anyone who asked. Tonight was no different in that regard, as Hermann Göring prepared to entertain business representatives from several German industrial companies as well as a few from the aviation industry. Göring had decided to dress up as a medieval hunter for this occasion, adding a working crossbow as yet another layer of his extravagant costume. He hoped to impress his guests with his skills in archery, but his desire to impress his guests was met by his own craving for pleasure. Göring sighed with relief as he leaned down to snort the meth line he had carefully organized on his desk, telling himself that this would be yet another successful party. At dinner, he felt a familiar sense of liveliness in his veins, and any doubt regarding his future success in Göringia and beyond quickly faded. Despite his relaxed mood though, he soon began to sweat. This was not uncommon in Göringia, but he found himself becoming increasingly frustrated and began pulling at his costume. As his guests talked mindlessly about their profits or the newest advances in German technology, he began to stare at each of them with his eyes narrowed. How could he ensure these men were not making the same offers to his rivals? When he realized he could not, he had finally had enough; Göring stood up, loaded an arrow into his crossbow, and shot it through the chest of the guest directly across from him. Laughing, Göring told his servants to close the only doors out of the room and methodically killed the rest of his guests. When it was over, Göring stood by the window, studying the broken body of a guest who had attempted to create their own escape. He shot a few arrows into the limp body for good measure and smiled with satisfaction, thinking it had been a successful party after all."
goering.3.a:0 "This is the most fun I've had in a long time!"

goering.4.t:0 "The Most Dangerous Game"
goering.4.d:0 "Herr Bauer was a representative from Krupp Industries, ostensibly traveling to Dar es Salaam to promote closer ties between Göringia and the German Empire. However, when his plane arrived, he was taken for a two hour drive through bumpy white paths that could barely be considered roads, until finally arriving at the Göring castle residence. Hermann Göring himself greeted Bauer at the door, wearing an outfit that seemed more fitting for a safari than a formal meeting. Indeed, Herr Bauer was told that the two men would be going on a hunt as soon as the new arrival changed into more fitting attire. Later, as the pair set out on foot, Bauer found himself wondering why they were hunting so close to the castle. His thoughts were interrupted, however, by the buzzing of mosquitoes around his face. In the time it took to swat them away, he had almost lost track of Göring, who was apparently far more fit than he looked. The host called out to Bauer to keep up, lest he lose any chance of bagging his own kill by the end of the hunt. Bauer hurried to catch up, wondering when they would get a chance to discuss real business, but Göring stopped his guest, shushed him, and pointed to a clearing that was barely visible through the dense vegetation all around them. Bauer was barely able to glimpse something-a paw, a tail perhaps-before it disappeared. Göring grunted and carefully pursued whatever it was, and the uncomfortable businessman did his best to follow. As he ran through the brush however, Bauer tripped over something in the ground, falling face first into the dirt. He looked behind him at his feet, wanting to see what it was that had tripped him, but as soon as he saw it, he stood up and ran, ran until he slammed into Göring. The heavier man turned and shook him, asking what the problem was. Before he could tell Göring about the skull though, he saw the negro on the forest floor, blood flowing from a bullet wound in his neck. It was only then that Herr Bauer understood what they had been hunting."
goering.4.a:0 "Business sure is different in Göringia"

goering.5.t:0 "Dinner and Drinks"
goering.5.d:0 "Ever since the day Mittelafrika fractured, Hermann Göring had taken a liking to cooking. It was one of the only hobbies he had that gave him a feeling of peace. Today was no different, as Göring took it upon himself to prepare dinner for his guests. Tonight, the dish would be Bratwurst, made fresh from his own pork. He was convinced it had to be a meal of stellar quality, for these were not just any guests; they were his rivals. Herr Bauer was among the men who would be joining him, though he was not a rival. Bauer was worse than a rival; he was useless, and had been ever since the hunting trip between the two sent the man into shock. Göring sighed and sprinkled the cyanide on all the Bratwursts except for his own, on which he sprinkled cocaine instead. As he opened the doors to the dining room, still wearing his apron, he smiled at his seated guests. It saddened him that none of the men in the room seemed as happy to see him as he was happy to see them, but that just meant they meant business. Göring shook his head and served everyone a dish with the sausage and seated himself with his own serving, the one with cocaine on it. He encouraged his guests to smell the oh-so-delicious food as he leaned down and sniffed the entirety of the Bratwurst. His guests were disconcerted by this move, but they did so as well, not wanting to anger their host. As the men ate, Göring watched as each succumbed to the cyanide, with Herr Bauer, the last alive, trying to drink from his glass to save himself, only to realize it was blood he was consuming instead of wine. Göring suddenly felt heat on his face, as he often did after snorting cocaine. He called his servants to bring in some ice, plopped it in his blood juice, and drank it all down in one gulp."
goering.5.a:0 "That really hits the spot!"

goering.6.t:0 "A Life of Luxury"
goering.6.d:0 "As Hermann Göring lay awake in bed one night, he realized that he was missing something. He had control over a large chunk of the former Mittelafrikan colony, was becoming the richest man on the continent, and had servants to tend to every whim or need. Göring could not place his dissatisfaction until he thought of all his extravagant outfits. Beautiful as they may be, he had little else to give life to his castle. Even his office was limited to a few wall mounts, and that room badly needed redecoration. Göring stood up, careful not to disturb his wife, and left the room. He called a meeting of his most trusted advisors, despite it being the middle of the night, and when everyone was seated, he began. He told his audience of eye-rubbing old German men that he wanted to build a new pool of massive size, with tiles made of gold making up the pool floor. A few of his advisors shook their heads in confusion at this request, obviously not comprehending Göring's brilliance. To go along with this pool, he demanded a motorized surf board, so he could traverse his pool in comfort. His next requests were for Giraffe-skin rugs in every room of the house, a golden cigar, and a pair of eye-massagers, which would puff air into his eyes to relieve them after a long day of work. Next, he was now wealthy enough to buy his own personal tank, and he demanded this be done at once: the roads were becoming too bumpy as of late and he wanted to smoothen them out himself. Seeing one advisor drift off to sleep, Göring pulled out his pistol from his robe and shot the man three times in the torso. When the deed was done, Göring sat in his chair, put his feet up on his servant boy's back, and lit a cigar, smiling at the now wide-awake advisors. "
goering.6.a:0 "We've got work to do!"

goering.7.t:0 "The Finer Things"
goering.7.d:0 "Hermann Göring was one of the few clever men who had profited from the collapse of Mittelafrika, and he had done it by transforming the drug trade to serve his own ends. In fact, Göring had turned the African drug trade into the most profitable of its kind on Earth, but it was no easy task. Regardless, the collapse of Mittelafrika meant the elimination of any regulations regarding drug production, sale, and consumption. This helped immensely, but what also helped was the region's natural richness in methamphetamines, among other drugs or drug ingredients. While Göring still forbade his soldiers from smoking cigarettes, nearly everyone in Göringia, native or otherwise, knew someone involved in the rapidly growing trade, and Göring was now considered the richest man on the continent. He was wealthier than the Sultans of Egypt and Morocco, richer than any of the businessmen in National France, and certainly towered over any of his rivals in the other breakaway states of former German Mittelafrika. With free reign over this drug trade, Göring had turned it from a ragtag bunch of delinquents into a truly formidable organization, bribing politicians, circumventing laws, addicting hundreds of thousands, if not millions. Now, Göring was wealthy enough to enjoy the finer things of life, and that is just what he did. After renovating his jungle fortress, Göring had decided to create a hippopotamus farm in which he would keep the animals for his own enjoyment, and of course, to show off to visitors. He had the money to buy hundreds of different exotic outfits, more than he could ever dream of, and he even melted down skulls to serve as paint on one of his new automobiles. The best part about this newfound wealth is not what he is able to buy; it is the fact that his prosperity has only just begun."
goering.7.a:0 "Chaos is a ladder..."

goering.8.t:0 "Getting Clean"
goering.8.d:0 "It was the time of the week when Hermann Göring would usually receive his drug shipment from Dar es Salaam. He had anticipated this shipment less than he normally would, largely due to a doctor's visit earlier that day. His doctor had informed the large man that his health was rapidly deteriorating, and that if he did not cut down on his drug consumption, he could even die. As he sat at his desk and pondered what the doctor had said to him, his wife gently rested her hand on his shoulder and, as always, knew just what he was thinking. She asked him whether he wished to continue bearing the cost, both financially and physically, of so many different types of drugs. The cost was astronomical in financial terms, consuming a full twenty percent of Göring's weekly income, and she was also right that the physical cost was beginning to wear on him. Göring's once-normal teeth had yellowed, rotting in place, and his eyes had deep bags under them, regardless of how much sleep he got on one night or another. Göring made a decision: it was time to quit. The next day though, as Göring tossed the severed head of a servant to his new pet lion, he found himself craving the sweet release that morphine would give him. Morphine was perhaps Göring's favorite drug, as it made him feel nigh-invincible and gave him a reprieve from his usually stressful day. Now though, the only thing on his mind was the morhpine itself. It took everything he had, but Göring managed to abstain from usage. That night, Göring lay awake in bed all night, unable to sleep. Before the sun had even come up, he had vomited three times and felt like his heart was about to burst out of his chest. Doctors were quickly called to check on him and explained that he was going through acute opiate withdrawal, and that he had to wait it out. The next three days were the most agonizing of Göring's life, but when they were over, he felt like a new man. No longer did he crave the sweet release that had ironically become his prison. He was now a free man in truth."
goering.8.a:0 "Perhaps I am human after all!"

goering.9.t:0 "The Match"
goering.9.d:0 "It had been years since Göring swore off morphine, and in the meantime, his physique had recovered significantly. In fact, at a lean 100 kilograms, Göring was quite athletic for his age. As of late, he had been eager for any opportunity to show off his physical prowess before an audience, to show his people who ruled them. Until recently though, no worthy opponent had emerged to challenge him in a boxing match. However, a young man calling himself Idi Amin had trained as a boxer for years, and at 16, already towered over most men. He was a minor but ambitious warlord, rising in the border region between Göringia and Buganda, and it was time that Göring took action against him. When he challenged Amin to a boxing match, the younger man quickly agreed, and it was set to be broadcast on radio across Göringia. To his surprise and satisfaction, Göring learned that the match would in fact be broadcast all over the former Mittelafrikan colonies, serving as a sort of racial matchup and also one of a European colonist versus a native. Regardless, the day for the match came, and Göring entered the room in black trunks. This was Göring's first match, and despite all his bravado, he could not help doing a double take when the 6'3 man in white trunks walked into the room. The two men entered the ring and touched gloves, neither breaking the intense stare between them. Amin had told Göring in broken German that Göring would address him as King of All Beasts on the Earth and Fish in the Sea when he was done with him. To this, Göring said that he already was indeed an animal, though he would never be fit to be a king. When the bell sounded, Amin charged Göring like a bull, throwing jabs and crosses to try and knock the smaller man out early. For his part, Göring dodged and threw uppercuts to stay on the defensive, but at the first opportunity, he stepped inside Amin's stance and hit him in the chin with a vicious punch that had the force of a freight train. Amin stumbled back and crashed to the ground, the noise echoing off the walls. Göring stood over his foe as the man was counted out, then knelt down to sever Amin's head from his body. He took the head back to his castle, and when he arrived, he placed the head in a water tank next to his bed, so that he might look upon Amin's face in times of difficulty.""
goering.9.a:0 "Ah, now who said a rival couldn't be turned into a friend?"

goering.10.t:0 "Restoration"
goering.10.d:0 "Hermann Göring could hardly believe what he was seeing. The last few months had been hellish, especially for his troops, but as Göring's servants replaced his wall mount heads with the heads of his rivals, he could not help but smile. Huttig, Maharero, von Oldenburg, and Amin all decorated Göring's office. The warlord had even managed to get his hands on the broken body of Mzee Onyango Obama, and had severed his head for a spot on his wall. Now, as Göring sat staring at the faces of his vanquished foes, he thought of all the adventures he and his men had had along the way. Firebombing the Fulani, Gassing the Gabonese, Neutralizing the Namibians, it had all been one long journey for Göring. His victory had come not from any advantage in manpower, technology, or even wealth, for that matter. Instead, he had prevailed through sheer willpower, and perhaps with the help of certain stimulants as well, which allowed him to work longer hours than his rivals. His air force was one of the best in the world, and his tanks had thundered across the continent. For the unveiling of the new wall mounts, Göring had decided to outfit himself in the costume of a Teutonic Knight, imagining himself as a heroic soldier going forth to eradicate his foes with the help of God. It seems that the triumphant man had finally achieved this goal. Now though, with Mittelafrika restored, Göring's work was not over. In fact, it was only just beginning..."
goering.10.a:0 "I will make my forefathers proud!"

goering.11.t:0 "Betrayal"
goering.11.d:0 "Hermann Göring sat in his office, and as he put the paper down, he slammed his fist on his desk. Today was not a good day. He had just received word from the Kaiser in Berlin, and reading the letter made his blood boil. Göring had sent an offer to the Kaiser, asking to be given special privileges in Germany as well as a title essentially on par with the Kaiser himself, in exchange for ruling Mittelafrika in his name. Of course, this offer was turned down immediately, and worse, the Kaiser was apparently seeking a replacement for him. Göring sighed, stood up, and slowly made his way to the wall mount of Hans Hüttig. Staring into the man's perpetually open eyes, Göring asked him why Germans must always be so prideful. He meant no disrespect to the Kaiser or Germany as a whole with his request, only to receive his proper due, and the Kaiser had humiliated him. This could not stand; this was a betrayal. Göring decided he would write a scathing letter in rebuke. Fetching his blood pen, he furiously scribbled away, writing to the Kaiser that he was in fact no ruler at all, and that he would show Germany how a true Teuton should behave. He proclaimed his independence from the Kaiser, from the German Empire, refusing to support this disgraceful excuse for a German any longer. Now it would be Göring's time to shine!"
goering.11.a:0 "Besides, can he even hold a rifle?"

goering.12.t:0 "Insanity"
goering.12.d:0 "Hermann von Göring sat atop his throne of skulls, savouring his victory. He had done it; against all odds, he had done the unthinkable; conquer the entirety of former Mittelafrika. Yet to him, there was still more to be desired: he might have had copious amounts of money, drugs, men, and land, yet something was still missing.\n\n He thought back to the letter he received from the Colonial Affairs Ministry, offering a position in charge of a reformed Mittelafrika if he were to surrender to Germany. He scoffed at them, the audacity of bureaucrats wanting to take away the victory he fought so hard to earn. He thought of Berlin, all the arrogant men in suits who wanted to preside over a land they had never set foot in; it disgusted Göring. He thought about the Kaiser, a man who he once respected; a man who he once swore an oath to, a man he lost any respect for once he abandoned him and his men in the Dark Continent. The ignorance of the man; he wanted to be treated as King of Afrika, yet had he ever been in the continent, had he ever fought in battle to claim his legacy? Had he ever fought for the Empire in his family’s name?\n\n The answer was a resounding no. The Kaiser has no right to claim the title of 'King of Africa'. If anyone, anyone in the world, had a claim to the title of King of Africa, it was Göring; and Göring alone. He played around with the words in his head: “King of Afrika”  sounded nice, it sounded like a title he had rightfully earned.\n\n After a moment of hesitation, a moment of debate within himself, he made a snap decision. Göring was to be King, the King of all of Afrika and beyond. He had earned this title of King, more than anyone else in the Reich, more than anyone in the world. A crown was to be made, a coronation was to be held. The world would now hear of the glories of Hermann I, the rightful King of Afrika."

goering.14.d:0 "Always needing a new place to hold his ever-growing list of prisoners and the few dissidents caught alive, as well as seeking to expand his existing network of prison labor camps where enemies of this sham state slave away at the endless castles, illicit operations, military installations, and statues built and run in his own honor, Hermann Göring has set his sights on massive relics currently gathering dust in the capital in order to bolster this voracious fiefdom. Utilizing the large stadiums, sports arenas, and other venues constructed in Dar-Es-Salaam for the 1932 Summer Olympics, Hermann Göring shall refurbish these decaying urban behemoths in order to serve his own state anew. On old football pitches and running tracks, this generation of dissidents shall slave away in order to build a better fiefdom for Göring’s own future."

goering.15.t:0 "Göring’s Schnapps"
goering.15.d:0 "In the year of 1878, Wilhelm Mast created his own vinegar factory in Wolfenbüttel, Germany in order to supply the much needed liquid to the town’s local and booming mining operation, which utilized vinegar as part of a process called fire-setting that is used to heat the mined stone in order to cause it to crack apart, making it easier to work with. Filling in for the town’s desperate need for a steady supplier, Mast’s business boomed for a time, but eventually he began to also create wine at his facilities in order to diversify his brand and make extra profit, for wine is made in nearly the same way as vinegar while using the same ingredients. Fast forward a few years, and Wilhelm’s son Curt Mast would eventually take over the business, and with Wolfenbüttel’s potash and rock salt mining industries beginning to dry up around the same time, he would pivot his father’s company to solely focus on wine production. However, the wine industry was a cut-throat market then as it always has been, so Curt spent over a decade trying to perfect his own recipe for a unique alcoholic beverage in order to set his brand apart from the competition.\n\nAfter years of hard work and endless experimentation, Curt Mast finally had his product - a digestif liqueur blended with 56 herbs and spices, including everything from ginger and cardamom to star anise and licorice root, creating a spiced and zesty tasting drink which he called ‘Jägermeister’, or hunt master. Packaging the stiff new drink, itself 35% alcohol by volume, into green squared bottles - the only ones that didn’t shatter after being dropped onto his home’s wooden floor after testing hundreds of other bottle types - each emblazoned with the Stag of Saint Hubertus and Saint Eustace (for Hubertus is the patron saint of all hunters after seeing a stag whose antlers held a shining visage of the cross), this uniquely-German alcohol hit the shelves and boomed instantly, becoming a popular pairing with dinner in royal halls and domestic homes all across the Kaiserreich.\n\nHowever, Jägermeister’s most famous and most loyal fan is none other than our own Hermann Göring. Becoming addicted to the drink and often being seen drinking the beverage in public or at his own huntsman halls in his signature gold and hammered silver drinking beakers adorned with antler rosettes from his hunting set, it has been nicknamed as ‘Göring’s Schnapps’ or ‘Göring-Schnapps’ by the masses. Although he was passed over for the official title of Reichsjägermeister - or the Imperial Huntmaster - by the Kaiser in favor of his hated rival Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck aka the Lion of Africa, much to Göring’s chagrin, that has not stopped Göring from running his own House Order of Carinhall which also uses the Stag of Saint Hubertus as its own symbology as a rival hunting authority and gentlemen’s club to the official hunting bureau of the Kaiserreich, and with this stiff new beverage always at his side in a flask, especially as he uses state funds to massively expand Jägermeister production while cutting himself in on some of the profits, Göring shall prove himself as the true master hunter in all of wider Germania as he wobbles his way there one bottle and one safari at a time."

Not an uncommon occurrence, Göring claims these outbursts of fury are well within his rights as given to him and his colonial commission by the Kaiser. Waving his wax seal-stamped warrant about as he flies and yells aloud his various controversial ambitions, views, and theories and exclaiming that ‘Sovereign is he who decides the exception!’, Göring brings fire and death to any who oppose him and many who don’t while using a flimsy paper that largely just gives him the right to arrest the enemies of the Crown so that they may face the Crown’s justice. Always one to bend the rules to his own wants and needs, this fact is glazed over and covered in ash and blood as the Albatros takes flight with one of Germany’s greatest and maddest aces at the stick once again."

A staunch supporter of the self-serving, corrupt nationalist his employers subscribe to and the inventor of the ‘Sovereign Staathalter’ defense that Göring now wields as a carte blanche to do whatever he pleases ‘in the name of the Kaiser’, Frank is who shall be in Göring’s corner as the Black Dossier comes to light and the Kenyatta-Sol Affair kicks into dreadful action. Ready to defend Göring, Heydrich, Andrae, and the rest of the plotting heads of the Souveränisten’s secret interests, it would seem like all of Göring’s allies, confidants, and business associates better call Hans as Berlin begins to rain their own form of justice down upon our heads."

Goering has fled his quaint life in rural Utah as chaos consumes the United States in order to start his new, ‘true’ life as the supposed heir to the Göringian throne, if it even has one. This mad idea has been hatched by Werner, himself formerly a pilot for the American military, because he has come to hold dear the strange and grand delusion that he is the secret nephew of our Herman Göring, estranged and separated by thousands of miles. Clearly a nutcase, but a nutcase with knowledge of American military procedures and aeronautic technology, and a nutcase that if indulged would be loyal to the true Göring to a fault, Werner could prove valuable. Already having an uneasy relationship with his other nephew, or rather nephew-in-law, the famed rich kid turned mercenary and humanitarian airman Carl Gustaf von Rosen who left his rich, Right-wing Swedish noble family behind in order to carve out a life for himself in Africa much like Göring himself has here, it is no wonder that our leader is a bit tentative to accept another fringe and probably non-existent family relation. We could simply send this nutter back to America, or we could pump his brain for all its worth then send him on a suicide mission to be rid of him for good.

The aurochs or Bos primigenius is an extinct cattle species of massive size that served as one of humanity’s stepping stones towards creating modern cattle, but sadly the last one was said to have died out in the Jaktorów forest of Poland in 1627. Using various breeds like Highland, Hungarian Grey, Corsican, Murnau-Werdenfels, Angeln, White Park, Brown Swiss, and Black-pied lowland cattle breeds, the Heck brothers shall take another shot at their prize in order to create a new symbol of Germanic scientific might and our mastery over nature, with plans to use the new beasts both for the domestic beef, leather, and wider cattle industry as well as for trophy hunting tours and safaris. With this revived program starting anew being paired with an initiative to create more hunting grounds, nature reserves, national parks, zoos, and more around the state, as well as other breeding programs aimed at the creation of new beasts of wonder or the pseudo-revival of others, and a surprising new group of laws banning animal cruelty, vivisection or the live dissection of animal, and even experimental testing on live animals, Göring shall transform our neck of the woods into a true paradise for lovers of nature and lovers of hunting nature alike."

goering.20.t:0 "Göring’s Most Breathtaking Vice"
goering.20.d:0 "Though known to dabble in various lucrative and illicit trades or vices, Hermann von Göring has long held a particular sweet spot in his heart, or more accurately in his lungs and in his pockets, for the fine tobacco products and other, more shadowy dealings of Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH - more commonly called Imperial Tobacco - centered in Hamburg, even maintaining a close friendship and strong business ties with Reemstma’s current CEO Philipp Reemtsma as well as with their premier tobacco expert, the Austrian-born aficionado David Schnur. Inviting Schnur and Reemtsma into his inner circle along with official jobs within his government, Göring has begun to slowly take more and more control over the business as he uses it as an unofficial arm of the state’s economy, with Göring’s efforts made possible by him bailing his CEO friend out of legal troubles back in Prussia in the mid 1930s that could have bankrupted the company along with Göring helping sweep claims of forced labor under the rug, forcing Reemtsma to owe Göring more and more as he endless gobbles up more of the company with mass stock purchases and minor, but accumulating, policies of pseudo-nationalization and corporatism, and by replacing more and more of Imperial Tobacco’s workforce with his own near-endless supply of cheap indentured labor from Mittelafrika.\n\nWith his ties and dealings to Reemtsma secure, Göring has made taxes on tobacco one of the most profitable sources of extra income for the state while also incorporating them more deeply into normal daily life by having them distributed for free to soldiers, laborers, prisoners, workers, and civil servants across the nation as part of military rations, standard paychecks, and government handouts, with Reemtsma even stooping so low as to even hand them out freely to minors and children laborers - all to get the nation more hooked, thus giving Reemstma more business and by extension giving the ever-gluttonous Göringg more profits."

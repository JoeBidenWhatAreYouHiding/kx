### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MAZIMILIANO_HERNANDEZ_MARTINEZ_DESC:0 "Maximiliano's political career has been tough ever since it began. With his coup against the civilian government in December of 1931, he's been bombarded with tough decisions which led to the Salvadoran Uprising in 1932. This has proven to be a stain on his political career, with sentiment against him being rampant not only among the general populace but also in some elements of the army. However, the United States aligns with him which is the only thing keeping his political career safe for the time being."
POLITICS_OSMIN_AGUIRRE_Y_SALINAS_DESC:0 "Osmin Aguirre y Salinas has been a military officer for since he came of age, and as such, has dwindled little in the local Salvadorian politics. This changed in the 1931 coup d'etat led by Martinez, where Salinas became General Director of the National Police, War Minister and provisional leader of the Civic Directory, which gave supreme power to General Martinez. However, mounting unrest in the army have turned Salinas into the voice of opposition against Martinez. With Martinez' mistakes during the Second Western Uprising have made the army choose to overthrow Martinez for Salinas, but whether Salinas will be able to secure El Salvador and reform it effectively remains to be seen..."
POLITICS_Salvador_Castaneda_Castro_DESC:0 "Salvador Castañeda Castro, elected as the headmaster of the Gerardo Barrios Military Academy and Minister of Government by Martinez after his coup in 1931, has kept a rather low profile in the country overall. Having defected from Martinez' forces during the Second Western Uprising, it almost seemed like the General was a defender of democracy. Apparently, He has other plans for the Salvadorian democracy, ones that differed greatly from the PL and the PND. Seeing the Red Menace looming over Central America, Castro took advantage of the government's refusal to crack down on rebellious military elements and secretly allied with them, waiting for the Laboristas to make a wrong move to take over El Salvador. Now that he is in control of the nation, he'll purge the Syndicalists from any position of power, all while trying to provide some semblance of democracy to the populace to avoid a new uprising, even if this 'Democracy' will prove to be nothing but a ruse..."
POLITICS_ALFONSO_MOLINA_DESC:0 "Alfonso Quiñónez Molina has had a long political career by Salvadorian standards. He had been learning the ropes of governance from his time as Vice-President for his Brothers-in-law Carlos Meléndez and Jorge Meléndez from 1915 to 1918 and then from 1919 to 1923 respectively; becoming Provisional President in 1914 and 1919 first and then being elected as Constitutional President in 1923. Public outraged ensued after his election, with plenty of media outlets considering his rule as a pseudo-monarchy which came to be known as the Meléndez-Quiñones Dynasty. Despite the bad press though, his rule saw the greatest coffee boom ever registered in El Salvador's history, making the nation reach record levels of economic prosperity and catapulting Molina's popularity to new heights. However, many episodes of repression during his rule had severely damaged his reputation and was forced to step down when his term was over. The hardships El Salvador has been forced to endure in his absence have made many miss the times of prosperity that he brought, and with a lack of any other strong liberal candidates, the PND decided to contact Molina once again to lead the liberal coalition, to which Molina has gladly accepted. Now that he's back in power, he has promised to do anything in his power to deliver prosperity back to the Salvadorian nation and its people."
POLITICS_ARTURO_ARUAJO_DESC:0 "Arturo Araujo Fajardo studied to become an engineer in England, where he became a strong follower of the British Labour Party's policies before the Weltkrieg. Upon his return to El Salvador, he quickly became a follower of Alfredo Masferrer and his ideology, 'Vitalismo' and in 1930 he made up his mind to finally take part in Salvadorian politics officially and formed his own party, the Partido Laborista, which received immediate support thanks to Masferrer's endorsement. The Laboristas won the 1931 election, and Araujo's career seemed to have practically skyrocketed overnight. However, economic hardship, social instability and opposing the interests of the army and the rural oligarchy only weakened Araujo's position further and further. His presidency came to an end when his Vice-President and Minister of War, Maximiliano Hernandez Martínez made a successful coup d'etat in December 2nd, 1931, sidelining Araujo from any politically relevant position and ending democracy in El Salvador. However, with the Second Western Rebellion being successful and Araujo having been chosen to lead his country for the transition to a full democracy once again, he has become a beloved figure in El Salvador, and his rule is bound to see progressive reforms and welfare be introduced to the nation."
POLITICS_FELICIANO_AMA_DESC:0 "José Feliciano Ama, a chieftain of the Pipil tribes in Izalco that successfully escaped the 1932 massacre, has managed to become the Head of State of El Salvador. Ama, lacking any sort of formal education and ideology, will delegate most of his work to his ministers and will work mostly to uphold the status quo and improve the overall situation of El Salvador's natives and peasants, regarldess of language, ethnicity or religion."
POLITICS_AGUSTIN_FARABUNDO_MARTI_DESC:0 "Agustin Farabundo Martí started his political career protesting against the Meléndez-Quiñones Dynasty and taking part in the first worker's organisations in El Salvador. He'd later volunteer to help the Zapatista forces after the Plan of Agua Prieta came into effect, where he would meet who would be one of his closest friends for years, Augusto Cesar Sandino. He would continue his career of political activism, and would later help Sandino with his fight in Nicaragua. However, with time, Martí grew further and further apart from Sandino, with them disagreeing more and more often on the fate of their countries should their revolutions succeed. Martí eventually gew further and further appart, and their relationship reached a breaking point in 1929 where Martí tried to punch Sandino in a drunken rampage. Despite having apologized formally with Sandino several times, he decided to return to El Salvador in 1930 and start leading the revolutionary movement by himself. His time would come in 1932 where he tried to lead the First Western Uprising, but after being delivered a crushing defeat by Martinez, he fled to Mexico to continue preparing for the revolution in El Salvador. Now that he's in power, he'll do his best to bring about the European-style Syndicalist Utopia he has dreamed of, even if this dream may seem far off for an agrarian region like Central America..."

The American company Curtiss-Wright Corporation has sent us a really good batch of biplane models back in 1933. While they were used to train our pilots, we now require them to have firepower, and it's because of this that our engineers have made a modified design that allows the usage of machine guns.

While it's manoeuvring capabilities don't surpass those of the Curtiss-Wright and the Fairchild airplanes, our engineers have come up with a version of the T-6 which can be used for coastal patrols and naval bombing. We shall request their production capabilities to produce these new designs, all for the right price of course."

### Events ###
els.1.t:0 "Introduction to El Salvador"
els.1.d:0 "Maximiliano Hernández Martínez's coup as Vice-President against the Laborista Party and Arturo Araujo in December of 1931 brought immediate strife to the nation, with a true restoration of democracy being ended right as it began. The cause of this coup was an alarming salary cut for the military in favour for the police, which helped him get a small amount of support from the population. With his policy of suppressing all opposition, militarisation of the state, and banning all other parties from elections besides his Pro-Patria Party, Martínez managed consolidate his grip on El Salvador. While this was effective at first, this all changed on May 16th, 1932.\n\nThe 1932 Peasant Massacre began due to Maximiliano enacting policies against the natives in the west inspired by Agustín Farabundo Martí and Feliciano Ama. While this wasn't a threat at first, the success of the Nicaraguan Revolution by Sandino flocked more to the rebel side. While still not being able to make gains against the military, Zapata's victory in the Mexican elections supplied guns for the rebels. The rebellion managed to last until January 22nd, 1933 with 70,000 dead and rebel leaders Feliciano Ama and Agustín Farabundo Martí retreating to Mexico.\n\nPartisans are no longer an uncommon sight within El Salvador, with Maximiliano's regime being hated by a significant portion of the people. Not only that but Maximiliano's way of handling the rebellion has caused disloyal elements of the military to emerge, and Maximiliano's regime being held on a tight string the American's are holding up."
els.1.a:0 "Maximiliano will make up for the losses he caused."

els.2.t:0 "The Depression Worsens"
els.2.d:0 "The recent German market crash has once again completely destroyed our economy due to its heavy reliance on foreign exports. With countries being unable to buy our coffee and the United States condition becoming less stable, the Martínez regime is being backed further and further into a corner politically as a result. We'll need to act carefully from now on if we wish for our country to survive the wave of socialism."
els.2.a:0 "Sure is nice that Martínez is good with the economy."

els.3.t:0 "Farabundo Martí Returns from Mexico"
els.3.d:0 "Hero of the 32 Massacre Farabundo Martí has recently returned in response to the American Civil War and the chaos our country has entered as a result. People have begun to blame Martínez for this slip-up due to the lack of border control as a result of the ongoing conflict within the country itself. Regardless, his return has begun to rally more and more of the populace against us, and rumours within the military are beginning to spread of an eventual coup in order to restore order."

els.4.t:0 "The Military Rebels!"
els.4.d:0 "Despite our victory against the reactionary forces, most of the Salvadorian military still hasn't recognized our rule as legitimate. While their scattered resistance poses no threat to the continuity of our government yet, we must tread carefully as they still pose a hindrance to our government, as they can still recruit reactionary volunteers from throughout the country. More importantly, they attack villages and government's convoys for supplies in the northwest, where retreat back to their hideouts in the jungles near Metapán, allowing them an easy escape route towards Honduras or Guatemala if they need to."
els.4.a:0 "They won't stop the revolution!"

els.5.t:0 "Confronting the Military"
els.5.d:0 "As the attacks on the northwest intensify, our people are growing increasingly restless, and the governor of Santa Ana province, Ramón Davila, has requested the government for an intervention of the province with whatever forces they can muster. However, our cabinet is currently undecided on whether confronting the military is a wise idea. Those men have sworn an oath to defend El Salvador, and maybe they'll come around to see things our way if we wait a little further."
els.5.a:0 "Request denied, they'll come to terms with our government eventually."
els.5.b:0 "Confront them, it's the only way to secure democracy."

#els.6.t:0 "Facing the Last Rebellious Military Remnants"
#els.6.d:0 "We have managed to gather a sizable militia force to face off the rebel enemy forces. However, many within the cabinet still insist that a peaceful resolution can be achieved, and we've recently received envoys from the military guerrilla claiming that they're open for negotiations. What should we do?"
#els.6.a:0 "Meet up with Leaders and try to strike a deal."
#els.6.b:0 "No deal, start the attack at once."

#els.7.t:0 "Meeting at Metapán Town"
#els.7.d:0 "After a temporal ceasefire was signed by the envoys, each side dispatched a delegation to the town of Metapán. There, the delegation of the guerrilla has demanded our government to allow the military to remain completely independent from politics and to be granted some executive power and autonomy on their affairs. News of the proposed conditions have reached the press and public outrage as ensued. While we still can try to bring them in peacefully, their demands make it painfully clear that they may be a liability in the future. On the other hand, we could take advantage of the outrage to attack them without public repercussions..."
#els.7.a:0 "We'll grant their requests if that brings stability back to El Salvador."
#els.7.b:0 "We won't allow them to backstab us again! Authorize the attack."

els.17.t:0 "Unrest in the Cities"
els.17.d:0 "After four years of violent rule, Martinez still tries to rule El Salvador with an iron fist with the support of the American government. However, the recent developments in both the US and the world are slowly but steadily weakening the power of Martinez, with many now openly questioning his government..."
els.17.a:0 "Uncertainty was to be expected in such a crisis."

els.18.t:0 "Salvadorian Exports Collapse"
els.18.d:0 "Black Monday has finished killing the already weakened Salvadorian exports, forcing landowners to make massive layoffs in order to stay afloat. Now many shipments of Sugar, Coffee and Cocoa just sit in the capital city with nowhere to be sent to and not enough local buyers to deal with the increasing supply."
els.18.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

els.19.t:0 "A Strike in a Sugar Mill of San Salvador"
els.19.d:0 "Workers at a sugar mill in San Salvador City have gone on strike, demanding for better working conditions and the payment of their wages, that are currently three months due. Martinez has issued a public statement claiming that he'll use violent force if necessary to break up the strike if they don't disperse on their own. Tensions are running high in the country, and this strike might be the last straw..."
els.19.a:0 "Let's hope they take the hint and disperse..."

els.20.t:0 "Martinez Suppresses the Strike"
els.20.d:0 "Martinez summoned the army to the capital to deal with the Strikers. Once the army was in range of the strikers, shots were ordered to be fired to scare them into dispersing. However, fearing a violent reaction, many soldiers shot the crowd head on, and chaos ensued in the city, with the strikers either trying to fight off the soldiers unsuccessfully or running away. Martial Law was temporarily declared by Martinez to deal with any dissidents, and the strikers that have been caught have been already sentenced to death by Martinez's decree..."
els.20.a:0 "He has gone too far this time..."

els.21.t:0 "Rumours of a Coup Reach the Press"
els.21.d:0 "Some anonymous sources have tipped the press about a secret meeting between high ranking officers within the army in the Centro del Ejercito Armado de El Salvador at San Esteban de Catarina. While the topics of the meeting have not been revealed, the recent developments have led the press to speculate that these officers have begun planning to overthrow President Martínez. The President has dismissed the claims as nothing more than fearmongering by the press, but the fear of a coup remains in public conscience."
els.21.a:0 "Who would believe such nonsense?"

els.22.t:0 "Martinez Reduces Public Salaries"
els.22.d:0 "In a bold move, President Martínez has decreed a reduction of all the public worker's wages from top to bottom, including his own salary. While this won't really have any real effects on the economy at large, the many workers of the country have found this move to be endearing, as the Salvadorian state was seen as corrupt and avaricious entity until now. With renewed support from the working class, he now has more room for improvement for his reforms, although that also comes with increased expectations..."
els.22.a:0 "A token move by the President, but it's appreciated nonetheless."

els.23.t:0 "Close the Banco Central de la Reserva de El Salvador?"
els.23.d:0 "The Central Bank of the Salvadorian Reserve was created in 1934 by Martínez in order to stabilize the value of the Salvadorian currency, the Colón. While this move was effective at the time, now that crisis has struck again, the Colón is in free fall regardless due to the overprinting of the currency done in order to pay for the state's debts. Many within the cabinet demand the Bank to be closed down, despite its usefulness in the past, and return to the times where private banks printed the currency of our country. What should we do?"
els.23.a:0 "Keep it Open."
els.23.b:0 "Close it."

els.24.t:0 "Construction of Affordable Houses for the Working Class"
els.24.d:0 "As the economic situation improves, President Martínez has decreed an ambitious construction program in order to create new and affordable housing for the working class citizens and the peasantry. This program, put in charge of the Junta Nacional de Mejoramiento Social, aims to provide for cheap housing and affordable mortgages to the many workers of the country that can't afford themselves a private mortgage. While the effects of this will not be immediate, this move is sure to secure the support at least some support within the working class for our President."
els.24.a:0 "¡Viva Martínez!"

els.25.t:0 "Subsidies for the Rural Workers"
els.25.d:0 "One of the most handicapped due to Black Monday has been the small to medium land owners and their rural workers. While they have kept the same production levels, the fruit of their work just sits in our harbours with no place to go, as there are no longer foreign buyers to acquire them. This has caused our agricultural output of our country to be reduced significantly, and many of the peasants in our country to be fired due to the lack of funding to pay their wages. In order to solve this and kickstart our agricultural sector back into motion, President Martínez has decreed the creation of a new set of state subsidies. These will be given to all the farmlands that produce coffee, sugar and cotton and will be funded by the Federación de Cajas de Crédito Rural, with the objective of improving the production of these vital crops back to their pre-Black Monday levels."

Due to the lack of natural barriers, our borders have shifted significantly before, but we're now ready to finally send them our final draft of the Common Border treaty, which shall be established in Rio Frio section at the Monte Cristo Hill. However, some members of our cabinet have advised us not to send the treaty, as we can take advantage of the shaky borders that we now possess to seize small portions of land in the future. What should we do?"
els.27.a:0 "Send the Proposal."
els.27.b:0 "Keep the Status Quo."

els.28.t:0 "Sugar Exports Fall, but the Economy Stays Strong"
els.28.d:0 "With the stabilisation of the world market, our rivals in the sugar market, mainly Brazil and Colombia, have begun to slowly but steadily recover their pre-Black Monday production levels. We cannot compete in the sugar market with their quantity nor quality of products, and our sugar plantations have started to suffer because of it. Nevertheless, we've still had a secure local market, and given that our agricultural output is not centred around sugar, this downturn is merely a minor hindrance."
els.28.a:0 "Our diversification efforts are successful."

els.30.d:0 "In order to secure the future of El Salvador, President Castro has decided to draft the blueprint of the political scene of El Salvador for the years to come.

els.61.t:0 "Native Population Begins Exodus Towards Honduras"
els.61.d:0 "After the defeat of the rebel forces at the Sonsonante Department, many of the natives have begun to flee towards Honduras. After 1932's rebellion, Martínez carried out mass executions of the indigenous Pipil people, and with their new rebellion being crushed, the many tribe leaders have decided to flee. This news has not been well received, as Martínez has ordered a shutdown of the border, but that doesn't stop the people from finding ways to circumvent the border controls through the Sumpul River."

els.62.d:0 "El Salvador has suffered a peasant revolt recently, and now that President Martínez has crushed their short-lived revolution, many of them have decided to flee towards Honduras.

els.66.d:0 "Unions are something of a novelty in El Salvador, and as such, we should look to expand upon them. However, a debacle has come out recently regarding the unions that exist within El Salvador on whether which one should be chosen to lead the others. One of our options, the 'Federación Regional de Trabajadores de El Salvador' or 'FETRES' has largely radicalized during the last few years, and strengthening them is sure to align our economy towards bringing the world revolution to Central America and defend ourselves from foreign imperialism. Our other option is the newly-founded 'Unión Nacional de Trabajadores' or 'UNT', whose more moderate approach is sure to benefit our local industry and the livelihood of our people at the expense of our war time capabilities."

However, Martínez still has to decide on whether to face the rebels head on, or try to secure the parts of the country that still haven't been taken over by the rebels. While facing the rebels head on might seem tempting, our forces are demoralized and disorganized, with the chain of command being shady at best, but if we try to secure the areas not controlled by the rebels, we risk allowing them to consolidate their grip on the occupied area and to be able to entrench themselves."

With this in mind, the municipial council of San Miguel has passed a proposal to allow the celebration to be postponed to the last weekend of November, and it's awaiting for presidential approval to be official. While this would bring us greater profit and allow more people to attend the Carnival, it would also be a small breach to our traditions, what should we do?"

ELS_temporary_recovery_desc:0 "After a series of reforms, we've finally managed to revert the damage that Black Monday did to our economy. However, we are still dealing with leftovers from the Great Depression, so it'll still take some reforms before we can get back on our feet once and for all."
ELS_minor_development:0 "Minor Development"
ELS_minor_development_desc:0 "As the economy starts to hum along with our reforms, our government can start focusing on small industrial projects in the La Libertad Department. This will help us spread our industry within our nation, and we're sure to reap the benefits of such investments in the long run."
ELS_status_foreign_assets:0 "Status of Foreign Assets"
ELS_status_foreign_assets_desc:0 "Many foreign companies reside within El Salvador, including a section of the infamous United Fruit Company. We've found rather recently that these companies have abused our current work code to abuse our workers, and it's time to decide what we'll do in response before there's public outrage."
ELS_revolution_wounds:0 "Wounds of the Revolution"
ELS_revolution_wounds_desc:0 "The recent revolt has left more than just mere social and political scars, as it has also affected our already rather fragile economy. The departments of Sonsonante and Ahuachapán have been completely devastated by the fighting, and since the Apaneca-Illamatepec mountain range coffee mountain range is in those provinces, it'd be in our best interest to get them back on their feet."
ELS_foreign_aid:0 "Foreign Aid"
ELS_foreign_aid_desc:0 "We cannot hope to handle the recent damages on our own. Fortunately for us, our resources are plenty, and our trade partners are still prosperous enough to help us out. We'll ask our trade partners for new concessions, and begin a series of law reforms, tax exemptions and tax breaks in order to facilitate the settlement of branches of foreign companies in our country."
ELS_agriculture_funding:0 "Agricultural Funding"
ELS_agriculture_funding_desc:0 "The lifeblood of El Salvador is and has always been its agriculture. The recent crisis has hit harshly both the working peasants and the landowner oligarchy in equal measure. If we ever hope to recover from the crisis, we need them to be back on their feet and producing new crops. We shall start a series of subsidies to these groups, so that they can return to normalcy and help us take our country back to prosperity."
ELS_resuming_development:0 "Resuming Development"
ELS_resuming_development_desc:0 "With the wounds of the revolution now beginning to finally heal, our economy getting back on track and the economic crisis that had kept El Salvador down finally ending, it has come time to resume our development. El Salvador shall not stay behind its neighbours, and we will endeavour ourselves into the improvement of our nation until it becomes the envy of Central America for its economic strength."
ELS_syndie_economy:0 "A Socialist Economy"
ELS_syndie_economy_desc:0 "For many years the workers of our nation have unfairly suffered under the capitalist working system's woes. From this day forward, El Salvador shall strive to bring about a fairer society, following the ideals of Alberto Masferrer's Vitalismo, where every individual, regardless of gender or race, shall have the right to a basic standard of living through equal access to education, work, food, and shelter."
ELS_agriculture_reforms:0 "Agriculture Reforms"
ELS_agriculture_reforms_desc:0 "Agriculture in El Salvador will remain as one of its most important economic boons. However, this sector has been dominated for decades by a wealthy elite, which has done nothing but exploiting the rural peasants for their own gain. Now, it is our duty to help the peasants to achieve the same prosperity that those landowners used to have, but in order to do so we'll need to carry out an in-depth agricultural reform."
ELS_safety_common_man:0 "Safety for the Common Man"
ELS_safety_common_man_desc:0 "Safety regulations in El Salvador are nothing but a group of foggy set of token laws made during the Meléndez-Quiñones dynasty in order to please the working class. If we wish to give every individual within our country the right of to a worthy standard of living, we need to improve upon our work code's safety regulations."
ELS_supporting_unions:0 "Supporting Unions"
ELS_supporting_unions_desc:0 "The Unions in El Salvador have been weakened these last few years due to the tyrannical regime of Martínez. However, now that the people are in power, we need to bring the unions back up so that no companies may continue to exploit our citizens, be it a worker or a peasant. For this, however, we need to choose first which union we shall we support..."
ELS_follow_fellow_unions:0 "Follow the European Method"
ELS_follow_fellow_unions_desc:0 "El Salvador has always looked outwards in order to improve itself, and Europe has always been the place to draw inspiration from. With the rise of syndicalism in Europe, while threatening to some, it is enlightening to us, proving that a society led by trade unions is both feasible and effective. We shall take up their example and provide the unions with a bigger say in government affairs."
ELS_new_socialist_economy:0 "A New Economy"
ELS_new_socialist_economy_desc:0 "With our reforms now in full effect and our projects reaching their conclusion, we can now finally inaugurate our new economy. With the installment of better safety regulations and more equal work laws, our economy shall be both prosperous and beneficial to the workers that reside within El Salvador."
ELS_starting_industrialization:0 "Starting Industrialisation"
ELS_starting_industrialization_desc:0 "El Salvador cannot rely only on its agricultural exports and the recent Black Monday crisis has proven it. We need to begin an industrialisation process, even if it is to a limited degree, in order to secure our country's economic production even when faced with the collapse of industrial giants like Germany or the US."
ELS_foreign_development:0 "Foreign Development"
ELS_foreign_development_desc:0 "It'd be foolish to believe that our small nation could be developed only be itself. We lack the tools and the knowledge in order to do so, but the world is filled with countries who possessed them, and that would be more than happy to share them with us if we offer them access to our precious agricultural goods."
ELS_military_funding:0 "Military Funding"
ELS_military_funding_desc:0 "Despite the internal problems the army has had in the recent time, there's no denying that they are indeed the protectors of El Salvador against its neighbours. With tensions rising in Central America, our army will need every rifle that we can produce. For this, we cannot rely on foreign arms companies, and we should look towards expanding our own arms industry."
ELS_promoting_civillian:0 "Promoting Civilian Development"
ELS_promoting_civillian_desc:0 "The importance of our civilian industry must not be underestimated. Our people will need clothing, construction materials and basic consumer goods, and we can't always rely on foreign companies to produce them. In order to achieve at least partial autarky, we need to improve upon our civilian economy."
ELS_san_salvador_la_union:0 "San Salvador to La Unión"
ELS_san_salvador_la_union_desc:0 "The roads from the city of El Salvador towards the city of La Union are rugged at best. We need to begin a massive campaign in order to improve the Littoral and Pan-American Highways, which will in turn both unite the Western corner of our country with the capital, and greatly benefit the towns of San Miguel and Usulután with the new traffic."
ELS_normal_economy:0 "Sticking to the Basics"
ELS_normal_economy_desc:0 "With so many radical ideas wandering around our nation, we must not forget that El Salvador is a small nation, and there are very few things that could bring prosperity to our country. One of these things has been our tried and true trading economy, which has taken advantage of the Salvadorian fertile soils to improve our overall economy. We shall stick to the basics and continue with this economic policy."
ELS_promoting_banking_reforms:0 "Promoting the Banking Reforms"
ELS_promoting_banking_reforms_desc:0 "In order to reach new economic heights, we need to provide our citizens with more capital for them to invest in new businesses, farmlands, tools and machinery. This money could be provided by our banking system but it currently has very strict financing terms. We shall begin a banking reform so that it may be easier for our citizens to start their own enterprises with financial support of the government."
ELS_beginnings_economy:0 "Beginning of a Proper Economy"
ELS_beginnings_economy_desc:0 "El Salvador has largely relied on backward agricultural and economic policies in the past and this has to come to an end. From now on, the Salvadorian government will endeavour it's efforts into turning the internal economic structure of El Salvador into one of the most modern in Central America."
ELS_american_market_washover:0 "American Market Washover"
ELS_american_market_washover_desc:0 "One of El Salvador's main markets has always been the United States of America. The recent developments in the American nation have certainly weakened our economic ties, but the profits that it used to generate for us were invaluable. We will try to reignite our fruitful economic relations with the American populace, regardless of their ideology."
ELS_promoting_trade:0 "Promoting the Coffee Trade"
ELS_promoting_trade_desc:0 "Coffee production is now at an all-time high, but we still don't have many stable buyers in order to sell most of our coffee supply. We shall begin diplomatic efforts in order to facilitate the selling of our coffee throughout the region, which shall in turn increase the profits of our economy, allowing us to reinvest towards improving our efficiency."
ELS_new_trade_economy:0 "Trade Based Economy"
ELS_new_trade_economy_desc:0 "With our reforms now in full effect and our projects reaching their conclusion, we can now finally inaugurate our new economy. While many can claim that we're continuing the economic policies of old, we can prove them wrong as our profits are now greater than ever, and our focus outwards is proving to be largely successful despite the claims of exploitation by the syndicalists. Today is a great day for El Salvador!"

## Army Tree ##
ELS_beginning_army:0 "Revamping the Army"
ELS_beginning_army_desc:0 "With tensions rising in Central America, we found ourselves ill prepared for a large-scale conflict. We shall start a modernisation program, starting with a set of manoeuvres in the central region of our country. This should be the first step in bringing our country up to par with any foe who might threaten it."
ELS_guerilla_warfare:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
ELS_guerilla_warfare_desc:0 "The many years of insurgencies within El Salvador have proven that the terrain in our country clearly favour a decentralized guerrilla force. We shall focus our modernisation program towards asymmetric warfare and the usage of guerrilla tactics instead of conventional warfare tactics."
ELS_low_recruitment:0 "Heighten Recruitment"
ELS_low_recruitment_desc:0 "The population of El Salvador is the second highest in Central America, only surpassed by Guatemala. We could take advantage of this fact, but a guerrilla force requires large numbers to work and our current recruitment methods are simply not enough to attract volunteers. We shall start a massive propaganda campaign to attack the young idealists to our force with promises of honour, glory and camaraderie."
ELS_never_surrender:0 "Salvadoran Pride"
ELS_never_surrender_desc:0 "The heroes of Centroamerican independence were mostly Salvadorian. People like José Simeón Cañas, Domingo Antonio de Lara or the Aguilar y Bustamante brothers lead armies against overwhelming forces. Once again, our nation stands threatened, not by foreign oppressors, but by our once so-called brothers. Our very survival is now at stake, and every Salvadorian man shall be called in for duty!"
ELS_jungle_warfare:0 "Jungle Warfare"
ELS_jungle_warfare_desc:0 "The topography of El Salvador favours those who learn who to fight in its varied environments. While urban combat would work in densely populated zones like San Salvador or Managua and mountain combat in the many mountain ranges surrounding our nation, the most prevalent combat environment is the jungle. As such, we shall begin training in La Joya jungle to practice for such eventuality with our army."
ELS_supply_focus:0 "Conserving our Weapons"
ELS_supply_focus_desc:0 "El Salvador doesn't possess as much industry as our neighbors. While we surely try to compensate that fact buying weapons from other world powers, we're still reliant on a flow of weapons that is not always available. Every Salvadorian soldier shall be given in-depth knowledge on how to repair and maintain any of the weapons within our arsenal, as well as how to best recycle our ammunition."
ELS_professional_army:0 "A Professional Army"
ELS_professional_army_desc:0 "Our army has kept itself under very high standards thanks to continuous reforms since the country's birth. This tradition, started since its foundation with President de Arce y Fagoaga in 1824, has managed to allow our army to become one of the most advanced in Central America. We shall focus on improving our conventional warfare capabilities instead of resorting to guerrilla tactics."
ELS_consolidated_divisions:0 "Modernizing our Divisions"
ELS_consolidated_divisions_desc:0 "While our army has remained advanced in terms of our officer training and equipment, our army structure still resembles that of a newborn nation in the 19th century. We need to bring our army structure into the 20th century, and we shall focus on restructuring our army organisational system from top to bottom, which shall hopefully increase our combat effectiveness."
ELS_heavy_weaponry:0 "Heavy Weaponry"
ELS_heavy_weaponry_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg has proven that infantry is not the only factor in modern warfare. Any modern fighting force that hopes to be victorious requires an artillery force that can cover they infantry's advances and suppress the enemy in case of counter-attacks. With this in mind, we shall begin investments to improve our national artillery, which should be able to compete with the best cannons that even Krupp may offer!"
ELS_foreign_doctrine:0 "Borrow Foreign Doctrines"
ELS_foreign_doctrine_desc:0 "The world has been in constant conflict for the last 30 years, and while we may have taken notes by sending officers to foreign academies and as observers, we still cannot hope to develop combat doctrines as complex as Germany or France with their experiences in the field of warfare. We shall instead try to borrow from their doctrines to improve ours and hopefully gain the upper hand against our neighbours."
ELS_military_academy:0 "Promote the CGGB School"
ELS_military_academy_desc:0 "The 'Escuela Militar Capitán Gerardo Barrios' is our alma mater. This officer school has been supported with teachers and books from many countries like Germany, Chile and the United States. It's only logical that in this time of need we promote the academy, providing our soldiers with economic incentives to join the academy to become officers and improving the overall quality of the academy."

## Air and Navy Tree ##
ELS_beginning_air:0 "Beginnings of an Air Force"
ELS_beginning_air_desc:0 "The Salvadorian Air Force (FAS) is a relatively young branch of the military. Created to defend the sovereignty and integrity of the Salvadorian state's airspace, it still undergoing reforms and receiving eager recruits from the other branches and the civilian populace. We shall put these recruits to work in some exercises before doing any significant reforms."
ELS_basic_fighters:0 "Basic Fighter Development"
ELS_basic_fighters_desc:0 "We've imported several fighter planes during the last decade. While technically speaking most are simply training planes, our engineers have worked hard to turn these planes into decent fighting machines. If we use their knowledge, maybe we could reverse engineer these foreign planes and begin producing copies of these planes on our own."
ELS_plane_lease:0 "Plane Lease"
ELS_plane_lease_desc:0 "While we'd love to be able to sustain plane production on our own, the truth is that we can hardly handle our local rifle production, we'd have even more troubles trying to produce a local air force all on our own. Luckily, we still have contacts in the aircraft industry worldwide, who would be more than willing to sell us more planes to defend ourselves."
ELS_bombers:0 "Bomber Development"
ELS_bombers_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg has proven to the world that an competent air force will be the deciding factor in the wars of tomorrow. While fighters secure the skies, the bombers would support the ground troops with either direct support or by bombing the enemy's infrastructure. We already have plenty of fighters at our disposal, but we will need more bombers in our air force if we wish to compete against our neighbours."
ELS_plane_production:0 "A la Hora y en Cualquier lugar"
ELS_plane_production_desc:0 "El Salvador is a small nation, that can't really compete against its neighbours in terms of production. It is for this that we should focus on massive investments in our air force, as it can fight off a numerous enemy with relatively low manpower cost. With this, we will be able to field enough planes to stay true to our motto 'Within an Hour and in any place'."
ELS_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bombers"
ELS_naval_bombers_desc:0 "El Salvador doesn't possess any significant surface fleet to fight off enemies in the sea. If we don't wish to be caught off guard by an enemy landing force, it'd be wise to study our imported T6 models in order to create a better local variant of naval bombers with which we can guard our shores."
ELS_beginning_navy:0 "Forming a Navy"
ELS_beginning_navy_desc:0 "El Salvador doesn't have a formal navy to speak of. We shall begin our efforts to found one, starting off with a naval officers’ school. This one shall be placed at the Ilopango Lake and shall operate with wooden boats until a more formal fleet is established. Until the construction of the building is complete, however, these new naval officers will have to make do with one of the air force's hangars..."
ELS_commission_flagship:0 "Expand the Acajutla Port"
ELS_commission_flagship_desc:0 "The small coastal town of Acajutla owns our biggest port in the Pacific, and our only working port big enough to sustain our naval trade. If we wish to possess any seaworthy navy, we should focus on expanding the installations in Acajutla to include a small dockyard which should at least cover the basics we need to start off a navy."
ELS_sticking_basics:0 "Sticking to the Basics"
ELS_sticking_basics_desc:0 "El Salvador has no need for a grand battlefleet. If war was ever to threaten El Salvador, our manpower would be more valuable on land than in the sea. However, that doesn't mean that owning a navy would be useless. Trade is what keeps El Salvador alive, and in order to keep it this way we'll need escort ships for our convoys. We shall begin funding our engineers to come up with a good escort design we can produce."
ELS_convey_interception:0 "Convoy Interception"
ELS_convey_interception_desc:0 "One of the biggest surprises in the Weltkrieg was the effectiveness of submarine warfare. This invention has proven that a small naval force spread out could be a potential threat to the enemy's war effort by destroying its isolated shipments. We shall invest in this new technology, which shall hopefully give us the upper hand in case of a war against our neighbours."
ELS_salvador_rules_waves:0 "Patria, Lealtad y Valor"
ELS_salvador_rules_waves_desc:0 "With our navy school finally set up and our dockyards producing our own ship designs, the time has come for us to finally officially found the 'Marina Nacional de El Salvador' or 'MNES', and by Captain Yanez Urias's request, we shall give it the motto 'Country, Loyalty and Valour'."

On his return, he began studying in the faculty of jurisprudence and social sciences of the 'Universidad de San Salvador' before leaving his career during the second year. He was ascended to lieutenant in late 1903; to captain, in 1906 during the war against Guatemala, where he served under general Tomás Regalado and finally to Brigadier General in 1919.

ELS_OSMIN_AGUIRRE_Y_SALINAS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 24, 1899, in San Miguel city, El Salvador.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Osmín Aguirre y Salinas joined the army after ending his highschool studies. He rose through the ranks until becoming a colonel in 1930. He would later take part in the Directorio Civico after Araujo's deposal, and he'd be one of the main orchestrators with Martínez of the victory against the peasant revolt in 1932, where his talent as an officer began to shine through. He was assigned as the Chief of the Guardia Nacional and was eventually promoted to General. He has since then remained an influential figure within the Salvadorian army, despite his differences with the Pro Patria Party and Martínez.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Dislikes Martínez."
ELS_SALVADOR_CASTANEDA_CASTRO_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 6, 1888 in Chalchuapa, El Salvador.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Salvador Castaneda Castro signed up for the military as soon as he came of age. His grades at the officer academy allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks until he was chosen as the headmaster of the Salvadorian Military Academy. He has since then kept an impeccable service record, despite disagreements with both Martínez and Salinas."

He graduated the Salvadorian Military Academy in 1898 as a second-lieutenant and continued to rise steadily through the ranks, managing to become brigadier general in 1920. He was assigned as provisional president during the Legislative Assembly of 1934, where he tried to truly democratize the country and repay the debts that Martínez had left in two short years. However, his rule was short lived as Martínez led a coup against him and reinstated himself as dictator with American backing. This however has not changed his reputation, and he is still a trusted member of the general staff. Menendez is considered an honorable and loyal man both by the military and the civilian populace.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to politics."
ELS_AGUSTIN_MARTI_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 5, 1893, in Teotepeque, La Libertad Department, El Salvador.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Agustín Farabundo Martí Rodríguez lacks any sort of formal military training. However, he was involved with the Sandinista army for a long time, and returned to El Salvador in 1929. He tried to lead an armed uprising in 1932, but it failed due to American support of the reactionary forces, and he was forced to flee, first to Guatemala and then to Nicaragua with his old friend. With his victory in the '37 revolution, he has consolidated some knowledge in Guerrilla Warfare, and he has also become a Salvadorian national symbol.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Liked by his troops, beloved by the natives."
ELS_JOSE_AMA_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1881, in Izalco, Sansonante Department, El Salvador.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Feliciano Ama lacks any sort of formal military training. However, his participation during the 1932 uprising and the recent takeover have granted him a reputation of bravery and leadership in times of crisis for the native population\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Current Chieftain of the Pipil indigenous people."

ELS_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "With the coup d’état led by Maximiliano Hernandez Martinez in 1931, democracy in El Salvador has become a thing of the past, with the ultranationalist Pro Patria party keeping a tight grip on the country. With a socialist uprising having been squashed in 1932, Martinez stands tall and with no one to oppose his tyrannical rule...Or so he thinks. His control of the country is highly dependent on American support, and with the escape of the socialist figureheads during the 1932 uprising, the victory of Sandino in Nicaragua and rising tensions in the United States, it may only require for the great northern giant to look away for El Salvador to burst into flames..."

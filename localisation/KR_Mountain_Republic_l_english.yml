### Events ###
mtr.1.t:0 "History of the State"
mtr.1.d:0 "After the infamous events in Russia in 1925, along with the Don and the Kuban, the Mountain Republic once again appeared on the post-war world map. On the sly, former Minister of War and Dictator of Dagestan, Nukh-Bek Tarkovsky, gathered a militia and declared independence for the North Caucasus, calling on the Ottoman Empire for protection.\n\nAlready soon, in the middle of 1926, the status of the Mountain Republic was fixed in international documents. Along with official recognition by all the countries of the Reichspacht, the Ottoman Empire, Georgia and Azerbaijan, the Mountain Republic faced an imposed trade treaty with Germany and a significant contingent of Ottoman troops on its territory.\n\nThe formal government led by Tapa Chermoyev, an oil industrialist and millionaire, engaged in corruption over the following years, allowed the Dictator of Dagestan and his camarilla to take the lead in the republic and subdue it. \n\nAs long as Shamkhal Tarkovsky is in power, the Mountain Republic has hardly any hope of a democratic future. And once the Turkish troops leave the region, its independence will be under direct threat."
mtr.1.a:0 "We are just trying to survive."

mtr.2.t:0 "The Majlis of the Republic"
mtr.2.d:0 "Our Union is divided into seven (7) national republics, united under one government that is the Mountain Republic. As planned, the Majlis of the Republic, the main legislative body of our state, should be divided equally between seven nationalities of the Union. However, in actuality, this principle of equality is constantly violated, with the government of Chermoyev lobbying for the Chechen majority in the Majlis. This has led to the situation where the majority of bills approved in our council have been in favour of the Chechens. This has only further developed and enriched their region while leaving much of the rest of our union to rot. There are two main fractions in the parliament vying for power to change this situation: the ruling coalition of democrats, the SOG, and the opposition, consisting of a broad coalition of socialists."
mtr.2.a:0 "Interesting..."

mtr.3.t:0 "New Oil Field Discovered"
mtr.3.d:0 "A new oil field has been discovered in the Terek-dominated region around Grozny.

With Chermoyev’s current power and fortune, no other up-start has a chance at getting into the oil business."

mtr.4.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Mountain Republic"
mtr.4.d:0 "The Berlin stock crisis has finally reached us as well.

mtr.4.a:0 "Another crisis..."

mtr.5.t:0 "Changing The Majlis Quotas"
mtr.5.d:0 "We need equal representation for the seven nations in the Majlis. Currently, the majority of seats are held by Chechens, while others are lacking representations. We need to ensure that quotas on different peoples in the Majlis are respected, so that the seats in the Majlis are equally divided between seven nations. President Dzhabagiyev has introduced the legislative bill of Nations Equality into the Majlis. While the majority of seats are held by NPGK, at the same time the majority of our deputies are Chechens who will try to suppress the bill or join opposition."
mtr.5.a:0 "The Bill passes!"
mtr.5.b:0 "Chechens block the Bill."

mtr.6.t:0 "OKSP in the Government?"
mtr.6.d:0 "In order to rebuild our Caucasian democracy after 20 years of Chermoyev's rule, we will need to pass some socialist reforms.

mtr.7.t:0 "Unrest in the Army"
mtr.7.d:0 "With the news of OKSP gaining more power, there has been a large rise in unrest across our military forces. General Tarkovsky, an influential figure among the conservatives, has openly criticized president Dzhabagiyev and his ‘marxist’ taint. There are even whispers and rumors circulating our administration that Tarkovsky plans to coup the government if it becomes too 'socialist' in his view. We need to deal with this unrest as soon as possible."

mtr.10.d:0 "Our country desperately needs reforms in its electoral code, as the majority of our population, especially women, still lack the right to vote while the Chechen bloc also blocks any attempts at true democracy. While this reform could gain us a lot of support from the peasants and workers, the conservative classes and nobles of our country will be very displeased with us to say the least."

However, with Chermoyev and his goons getting richer by the second of black gold, the state and its people remain as poor as ever. With the nationalization of the oil industry at all levels, we can ensure that our country and its people will benefit from it directly, lifting both out of poverty and squalor."

mtr.15.t:0 "Media Crackdown"
mtr.15.d:0 "The clandestine organizations and think-tanks that currently are operating in the republic and within the OKSP are sharing socialist literature and theory; nothing more than propaganda for syndicalism, socialism and other spoilt ideologies, and all harmful to our conservative society. We need to install press censorship to block this agenda from our society and to save the innocent minds of our populace. The foul taint of Marxism will not infest our mountain home any longer as newspapers, radio, television, and literature across the state are censored, destroyed, or otherwise removed from the public’s access.."

mtr.17.d:0 "After the OKSP was banned, the socialists began to amass and gathered in the center of Vladikavkaz, in front of the Majlis building to protest against the government and its recent ‘tyrannical’ actions. The protest is rapidly becoming more and more violent with mass public disorder spreading throughout the city. Prime Minister Chermoyev has announced his total loyalty to the Republic and to democracy, and that he will stop at nothing to preserve the union, vowing to crush the anti-constitutional uprising, whatever it takes."
mtr.17.a:0 "Order the army to enter the city and crush them once and for all."

mtr.18.d:0 "With army entering Vladikavkaz, some sections of the protesters have broken off and run away in panic, while the majority, however, stayed strong at the Ploschad Svobody square. Tension is palpable in the air as the mob of protestors stare down the imposing wall of armed and uniform clad soldiers. The army is waiting for the Prime Minister’s orders, with the future of the Caucuses on the line, but the protestors are already beginning to see that the soldiers have a certain look in their eyes..."
mtr.18.a:0 "Shoot them!"

mtr.19.t:0 "The Army Brings Down Fire"
mtr.19.d:0 "The soldiers began to shoot in the air. With the first shot heard, the protesters divided into two main groups. The first group tried to run away from the square in one large and chaotic mass yet managed to be immediately captured by the army. The others stayed, and were later seen building barricades at the square. With the army surrounding the square, the fight has become inevitable. However, the protesters have nothing to fight back against armed soldiers of the Mountain Republic with, with most of them being unarmed or armed with simple tools and farm equipment. General Tarkovsky ordered the protesters to surrender or face a wall of lead.\n\nSuddenly, breaking into the gray, Korkmasov appeared in front of the protesters. He told them to calm down and go home to prevent bloodshed. After he ended his speech, narrowly avoiding bloodshed with his strong oratory skills, General Tarkovsky approached him and arrested him on the spot."

mtr.20.t:0 "The Protesters Seize the Majlis."

With Vladikavkaz in protesters' hands, the police are joining the socialists. Korkmasov has declared himself the acting president of the Mountain Republic."
mtr.20.a:0 "It seems that socialists are about to win."

mtr.21.t:0 "Socialist Victory!"
mtr.21.d:0 "With Chermoyev escaping, the police have begun joining the rebels and rioters as Korkmasov has declared victory for the OKPS.

With his ascension to rule, the red tide has reached the Caucasuses."
mtr.21.a:0 "We have a lot to do."

mtr.22.t:0 "Insurgency in Chechnya and Dagestan"
mtr.22.d:0 "Soon after Korkmasov announced victory, the autonomous republic of Chechnya and Dagestan refused to recognize the self-declared president and his new leftist government. There are protests and riots breaking out in the major cities of Grozny and Makhachkala and instability is mounting once more. We need to suppress these uprising as soon as possible!"
mtr.22.a:0 "Well, not all revolutions are peaceful."

mtr.23.t:0 "Tarkovsky Coups the Government!"
mtr.23.d:0 "With the overall support of our government having become too low, General Nukh-Bek Tarkovsky has managed to overthrow the current marxist government. Using his loyal contacts within the army, he and his followers marched on the capital today and rid the capitol building’s halls of all marxist filth. He's likely to install a dictatorial, authoritarian regime now as he is one of the only men willing to unite our now fractured nation which has been broken into separate pieces by the previous government’s ineptitude."

Since this very day, the official language of the Imamate shall be Arabic."
mtr.31.a:0 "Allahu Akbar!"

mtr.32.t:0 "Land of Islam"
mtr.32.d:0 "Allah has made so that we are Muslims - it was his will to direct these poor nations of Caucasus Mountains to the path of this faith - to become stronger and survive. Our land is holy and we will do anything to secure it from external threats."
mtr.32.a:0 "Our Holy Land of the Caucasus!"

mtr.40.t:0 "State of Army"
mtr.40.d:0 "Our army is not in a very good shape. In the strife of the Russian Civil War, the forces of the Mountain Republic were highly dependent on volunteers and Cossacks. After the war, most of the cossack forces have been withdrawn, except for the Terek Cossacks, that live in the Nogai Autonomous Republic.\nThe government of Chermoyev had formed the new Military Forces of the North Caucasus following the civil war, but the army lacked subsidies from the budget.\nIn 1936 our army is still woefully underdeveloped and unready for large-scale combat and warfare. Our armed forces are in desperate need of reform and modernization from top to bottom."
mtr.40.a:0 "We need to reform the army quickly to maintain our independence."


mtr.50.t:0 "Chairman Korkmasov's Speech"
mtr.50.d:0 "The Chairman of the OKSP, Jalal-ed-Din Korkmasov, has delivered a speech today in the People's Majlis of the Republic. He announced the immediate nationalization of all important industries and a final transformation of our Mountaineer society of the poor and humiliated into a new socialist society of happy workers toiling together for the common good.\n\nDown with the bourgeoisie, down with the traitorous capitalists, oligarchs and imams! Today our nation will join the International community of workers and peasants! Let the new Republic arise from the ashes of capitalism!' - exclaimed the chairman. His words left the crowd in an uproar as his words reached Causcasians across the nations, signifying the dawn of a new era for his peoples."
mtr.50.a:0 "Glory to Korkmasov!"

mtr.51.t:0 "First Decree of Chairman Korkmasov"
mtr.51.d:0 "Decree №1.\n\n\nEffective immediately, the OKSP will begin the war on corruption that plagues our bureaucracy.\n\nAll citizens of the Republic who report to the nearest administrative center of the OKSP in their local village or town and write an acknowledgement of guilt will be spared.\n\nThe stolen amount of money will be withdrawn either in Tumans or in property.\n\nIf the special Anti-corruption Committee considers that the total amount cannot be received by either money or property, a culprit will be arrested for corruption.\n\nChariman J.Korkmasov."
mtr.51.a:0 "We'll make our nation better together!"

mtr.53.t:0 "Constitution of the [ROOT.GetNameDefCap]"
mtr.53.d:0 "With the first socialist reforms of the OKSP, it's now time to adopt a new socialist constitution. This one shall guarantee equal and fair rights for all citizens of the mountains as well as guarantee certain socialistic freedoms to all Caucasians. Except capitalists, of course."
mtr.53.a:0 "Finally!"

mtr.55.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Wishes to Join Internationale"
mtr.55.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a request to join the Internationale. The small mountain state rests high atop the Caucasian Mountains, sitting on vast reserves of oil. What shall our reply be?"
mtr.55.a:0 "Welcome, comrades!"
mtr.55.b:0 "We cannot risk war with Russia!"

mtr.56.t:0 "French Commune Refused!"
mtr.56.d:0 "It is a real disgrace for a leading syndicalist country in the world to refuse our socialist workers to join the Internationale. Our delegates have returned from Western Europe with heads lung low and angry curses being hurled about, damning the ‘decadent fools’ for denying our membership into their ‘silly club.’"
mtr.56.a:0 "They are just a bunch of capitalists."

mtr.60.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Join Us!"
mtr.60.d:0 "A friendly government in [FROM.GetNameDefCap] sent us a request to join us. We could either accept them as an autonomy, granting them semi-independence within our borders, fully accept their offer of alliance, or just outright deny their offer, as the land is our rightful clay to begin with. How shall we proceed?"
mtr.60.a:0 "This land should belong to us - refuse the offer."
mtr.60.b:0 "Offer them autonomy."
mtr.60.c:0 "Welcome, comrades!" 

mtr.61.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused!"
mtr.61.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer. Instead, the [FROM.GetAdjective] stated that we should rather be annexed directly into their country. The nerve of some diplomats!"
mtr.61.a:0 "This imperialistic ambition is counter-revolutionary!"

mtr.62.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Offers Autonomy"
mtr.62.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a responding offer - we should become an autonomous state within their country. Though we would lose much of our independence, particularly when it comes to foreign policy, the protection it would come with is almost too good to pass up. How shall we react?"
mtr.62.a:0 "Better with [FROM.GetAdjective] protection."
mtr.62.b:0 "Our independence is sacred."

mtr.63.t:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] Refused!"
mtr.63.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused our offer."
mtr.63.a:0 "We will deal with them later."

mtr.100.t:0 "Agricultural Subsidies"
mtr.100.d:0 "The Mountain Republic is mostly an agricultural country, with cereal grains, tobacco, tea, and other vegetation all commonly grown here in large numbers. Our industry is not very developed however, and while the farmers and peasants we do have are spread all over the country and do their job perfectly, our agricultural industry gravely needs mechanization to efficiently operate. With the foreign capital drain from Black Monday sucking out extra funds dry, we will rely on our past agricultural achievements to weather the storm, and subsidize farmers to ensure the economic growth once the worst of the downturn passes."
mtr.100.a:0 "Money for our farmers!"

mtr.101.t:0 "Oil Treaty From [MTR.GetName]"
mtr.101.d:0 "The government of [MTR.GetNameDefCap] has offered us a new oil treaty. They want to grant us the resource rights in Dagestan in exchange for investing in their country’s fledgling economy. Though our pursestrings are tight right now, the amount of oil they possess is almost too good to pass up. How shall we respond?"
mtr.101.a:0 "We need to feed ourselves first. No deal!"
mtr.101.b:0 "Deal! The oil must flow!"

mtr.102.t:0 "Oil Treaty With Germany!"
mtr.102.d:0 "The Kaiserreich seemingly liked our initial offer and have accepted our deal of oil for financial aid. With the backing of the Kaiserreich, our industry and economy are set to soar as the new influxes of capital and resources come in."
mtr.102.a:0 "Fantastic!"

mtr.103.t:0 "Germany Refused The Deal"
mtr.103.d:0 "The German government has refused our generous oil treaty, citing the recent economic downturn from Black Monday as their reason for not having the funds to scrape together such an agreement. We will have to move forward without German aid, but at least we still have our oil."
mtr.103.a:0 "It seems we have to cope by ourselves."

mtr.104.t:0 "Protests in Dzaudzhikau"
mtr.104.d:0 "With the economic depression ongoing, the OKSP has gathered large anti-government protests in Dzaudzhikau. The protesters demand increased wages, creation of new jobs, and most importantly, nationalization of the oil industry. Leader of the OKPS, Chairman Korkmasov, has delivered a speech at the meeting, demanding the immediate retirement of president Chermoyev and transition of power to the workers' councils."
mtr.104.a:0 "Disperse the meeting"
mtr.104.b:0 "Promise something. Do nothing."

mtr.105.t:0 "'Alun Sherash'"
mtr.105.d:0 "A popular Chechen writer, Khalid Oshayev has published his novel about the Russian Civil War, called 'Alun Sherash' or 'Fervent Years'. It is a historical novel, consisting of three parts. From the pages of the novel, Oshaev depicts Chechnya in the years of the Russian Civil War. He tells how the Chechens had united the Caucasus under the flag of the Mountain Republic and how they bravely fought bolshevist forces to protect their homeland and secure independence."
mtr.105.a:0 "A great read from a great man!"

mtr.106.t:0 "Increased Separatism"
mtr.106.d:0 "With the overall support of our government having decreased greatly in previous months, there are more and more talks of separatism disseminating amongst the officials of our autonomous regions. These talks are very dangerous for the overall stability of our country, and if the elites think that our government is insufficient, they may try to launch a coup. We must remain vigilant and address our current partisan issues at once!"
mtr.106.a:0 "We need to do something."



mtrcw.1.t:0 "Dagestan Declares Independence!"
mtrcw.1.d:0 "Nukh-Bek Tarkovsky, with the help of Imam Gotsinsky, has united Dagestan and seceded from the union. They have openly announced that they will fight for their independence against the 'socialist mythical republic'. Our soldiers and militiamen take up arms across the country to defend their new Marxist home."
mtrcw.1.a:0 "Fight the traitors!"
mtrcw.1.b:0 "Down with the Marxists! (Play as Dagestan)"


mtrel.1.t:0 "Dzhabagiyev Criticizes the Government"
mtrel.1.d:0 "Our minister of economy, Vassan-Girey Dzhabagiyev has openly criticized our government as a result of Chermoyev's latest privatization of oil. He said that the oil privatization leads to further crisis of our country and poverty of its citizens. He will try to unite opposition politicians from the SOG party to join oppositional NPGK and oppose Chermoyev."
mtrel.1.a:0 "Our party splits apart..."

mtrel.2.t:0 "Dzhabagiyev Joins the NPGK!"
mtrel.2.d:0 "As promised before, Dzhabagiyev has announced to join People's Party of the North Caucasus. 14 deputies from the Majlis have joined the new faction in the parliament."
mtrel.2.a:0 "If they unite with OKSP, we can lose the majority."

mtrel.3.t:0 "The Election Campaign Begins!"
mtrel.3.d:0 "The 1937 elections will be the most difficult for the ruling party of Chermoyev to win. Not only has the creation of the opposite NPGK party made things more difficult, but also the Black Monday crisis has severely damaged our popularity in the eyes of the republic’s citizens. The election campaign has started, and we will need all the luck we can get!"
mtrel.3.a:0 "Down with rich oligarchs! Vote for OKPS"
mtrel.3.b:0 "We need changes. Vote for NPGK"
mtrel.3.c:0 "We shall secure the traditions. Vote for SOG"

mtrel.4.t:0 "Campaign Lost"
mtrel.4.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, we have fumbled our most recent campaign stop on the race for office. It seems that we decreased the popularity of our party in the public eye. We must act intelligently to secure a victory."
mtrel.4.a:0 "What a shame!"

mtrel.5.t:0 "We have a Successful Campaign"
mtrel.5.d:0 "We have held a successful event at our recent campaign stop in the race for head of the republic. We can be sure that voters like us."
mtrel.5.a:0 "Great!"

mtrel.6.t:0 "We celebrate a Tremendous Victory!"
mtrel.6.d:0 "We have held a great rally in the republic. Voters love us and are very likely to vote for us in the next elections."
mtrel.6.a:0 "Splendid!"

mtrel.7.t:0 "One Month Before Elections!"
mtrel.7.d:0 "Only one month left before elections. A lot has changed since the very beginning of the campaign: the country has dealt with the Berlin Stock Crisis, a new party, led by ex-minister of economy Dzhabagiyev, has appeared at the political scene, introducing a new, social-democratic path for our country. The political life in our country abounds in vitality."
mtrel.7.a:0 "Soon we will know the winner..."

mtrel.8.t:0 "Elections"
mtrel.8.d:0 "The elections are finally over. For almost a year the citizens of the Mountain Republic have witnessed the new political reality of the country. Three political parties have been trying to increase their rating in all of the seven autonomous provinces. The day has come to declare a winner."
mtrel.8.a:0 "OKSP Victory!"
mtrel.8.b:0 "NPGK Victory!"
mtrel.8.c:0 "SOG Victory!"

mtrel.9.t:0 "Opponent has a Successful Campaign"
mtrel.9.d:0 "Many other parties have also held political rallies in the neighboring regions. One of our opponent’s recent campaign stops was supposedly very successful. We should perhaps put more effort in this campaign."
mtrel.9.a:0 "Bad news."

mtrel.10.t:0 "Opponent has a Tremendous Campaign!"
mtrel.10.d:0 "Many other parties have also held political rallies in the neighboring regions. One of our opponent’s recent campaign stops was even a tremendous success. We should perhaps put more effort in this region if we want to win it."
mtrel.10.a:0 "What an awful display."

mtr.200.t:0 "Karachay-Circassia State"
mtr.200.d:0 "One of the autonomous regions in our country, the Karachay-Circassia, has also included the region of Abkhazia when we first declared independence in 1917. The population of Abkhazia, is considered to be of the same group as Circassians, and therefore, we believe that this region should be a part of our country. Moreover, it will give us access to the Black Sea and make it possible for us to develop our naval forces."
mtr.200.a:0 "Demand it outright!"
mtr.200.b:0 "Offer protection in response."
mtr.200.c:0 "We don't need it."

mtr.201.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Abkhazia!"
mtr.201.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] demanded that we hand over the region of Abkhazia that they claim as their core territory. How shall we answer?"
mtr.201.a:0 "We don't need war now..."
mtr.201.b:0 "They can have it, if we form a defensive alliance against Russia."
mtr.201.c:0 "Our answer is no."

mtr.202.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Gives Up Abkhazia!"
mtr.202.d:0 "The cowardly [FROM.GetAdjective] government has given up their claims for Abkhazia and now our forces already invading our core territory!"
mtr.202.a:0 "That is a victory!"

mtr.203.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands a Defensive Alliance"
mtr.203.d:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to cede us Abkhazia, only if we create a defensive alliance against Russian aggression."
mtr.203.a:0 "Sure, why not?"
mtr.203.b:0 "That's ridiculous. Abkhazia or war!"

mtr.204.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Cede Abkhazia"
mtr.204.d:0 "[FROM.GetAdjective] government decided that they want a full-scale war instead of peacefully ceding our rightful claim to us. Well, then it is war."
mtr.204.a:0 "Onwards!"
mtr.204.b:0 "Back down."

mtr.205.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Abkhazia for Protection!"
mtr.205.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government demands that we cede Abkhazia to them and in response they will guarantee our independence and fight alongside us in case of any foreign aggression."
mtr.205.a:0 "Alright."
mtr.205.b:0 "They can have it, if we form a defensive alliance against Russia."
mtr.205.c:0 "Our answer is no."

mtr.206.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agrees"
mtr.206.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has agreed to cede us Abkhazia, and now we only have to guarantee their independence and sign a non-aggression treaty."
mtr.206.a:0 "That is a victory!"

mtr.207.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused An Alliance"
mtr.207.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused the defensive alliance and instead they demand outright control of Abkhazia, unless they will declare war on us."
mtr.207.a:0 "We don't need war now..."
mtr.207.b:0 "Our answer is no."

mtr.290.t:0 "Peace with [MTR.GetName]"
mtr.290.d:0 "The [MTR.GetAdjective] forces have occupied our territory of Abkhazia. We can either sign a peace treaty and end the war, avoiding the spilling of innocent [ROOT.GetAdjective] lives, or we can stand vigilant and defend our borders and their integrity from these mountain aggressors."
mtr.290.a:0 "Offer them peace."
mtr.290.b:0 "We will never surrender."

mtr.291.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers Peace"
mtr.291.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] offered us peace and Abkhazia. Our military might has scared them into offering up the territory we claim before any serious amount of lives are thrown away in needless conflict. What shall be our response?"
mtr.291.a:0 "Accept the treaty, Abkhazia was always the goal."
mtr.291.b:0 "We shall destroy [FROM.GetName]."

mtr.292.t:0 "Peace Over Abkhazia?"
mtr.292.d:0 "We were unable to occupy Abkhazia. We must send a peace delegation to stop this aimless war. Hopefully we can prevent further needless bloodshed."
mtr.292.a:0 "Send the delegation at once!"

mtr.293.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers Peace"
mtr.293.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] offered us peace, seeing that their war with us truly is futile. We will show them the futility of their mistake by raising our flag above their capital instead. No one spills [ROOT.GetAdjective] lives and gets away with it."
mtr.293.b:0 "We shall destroy these cossacks."

mtr.208.t:0 "The Question of Azerbaijan"
mtr.208.d:0 "[ROOT.GetLeader] assumes that the state of Azerbaijan should be either a part of Greater [ROOT.GetName] or in a defensive alliance with us, as two our countries have close ties."
mtr.208.a:0 "Offer them to unite our nations in a single state!"
mtr.208.b:0 "Offer them to create a defensive alliance"
mtr.208.c:0 "That is a bad idea"

mtr.209.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers To Join Them"
mtr.209.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] has offered us to become a constituent state of their country. While we will lose our sovereignity, we will be united with our Muslim brothers."
mtr.209.a:0 "Sure, let's do this!"
mtr.209.b:0 "That is definitely a bad idea."

mtr.210.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
mtr.210.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to become a part of our state. Our peoples are happy that we are now a single state. Today will be declared a national holiday"
mtr.210.a:0 "Great!"

mtr.211.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused"
mtr.211.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to become a part of our state. While we should respect their decision, perhaps we shall make our motives even more clear..."
mtr.211.a:0 "We respect their sovereignity."
mtr.211.c:0 "Perhaps an alliance then?"
mtr.211.b:0 "Demand they join us or we declare war!"

mtr.212.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Demands Our Incorporation!"
mtr.212.d:0 "As we thought at first, the traitorous government of [FROM.GetName] had nothing to do with respect and trust between our nations. They have demanded our incorporation, otherwise they will declare war on us."
mtr.212.a:0 "We submit."
mtr.212.b:0 "We will fight for our independence!"

mtr.213.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers An Alliance"
mtr.213.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] has offered us a defensive alliance."
mtr.213.a:0 "Sure, let's do this!"
mtr.213.b:0 "We don't need an alliance."

mtr.214.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
mtr.214.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to form an alliance with us."
mtr.214.a:0 "Great!"

mtr.215.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Refused"
mtr.215.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused an alliance. While we should respect their decision, perhaps we shall make our motives even more clear..."
mtr.215.a:0 "Too bad."

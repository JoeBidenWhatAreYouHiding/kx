LEC_FRANCIS_FESTING_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nAugust 28th, 1902\nDublin, United Kingdom\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nGraduated from Sandhurst in 1921. Festing was looking at a promising career in the British Indian Army or at Eastern Command, having served as Aid-de-Camp to John Burnett-Stuart, former General Officer Commanding, Madras District right up until the even of the revolution. Now like most of the British officer corps who lacked a Syndicalist bent he finds himself drifting between the old colonies. Lacking the budget to commission him the Empire elected not not have him continue service in any of the extant dominions and thus he has wound up living with old army chums in Shanghai, where there's nobody to tell you to stop wearing the old uniform and a good chance of a stiff gin in the morning."
LEC_WILLIAM_FAIRBAIRN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nFebruary 28th, 1885\nRickmansworth, United Kingdom\n§YMilitary Career:§L\nA former Royal Marine and police officer in one of Shanghai's red light districts, William Ewart Fairbairn is most notable for his frankly frightening collection of scars accumulated from hundreds of street fights in the line of duty and for organising the SMP's specialist anti-riot squad. Known as "Dangerous Dan" Fairbairn is a master of boxing, wrestling, savate, jiujutsu, judo and kung fu, which he has used to develop his own style of combat known as Defendu. According to police records he has over 500 confirmed non-training fights both armed and unarmed under his belt, as well as a custom-made bullet-proof vest designed to stop bullets from a 7.63×25mm Mauser. He now spends most of his time encouraging other members of the Volunteer Corps to remember the basics of CQC."
LEC_REGINALD_TYRWHITT_NAVY_DESC:0 "§YAdmiral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nMay 10th, 1870\nOxford, United Kingdom\n§YNaval Career:§L\nEntrolled as a cadet on the HMS Britannia in 1883, Sir Reginal Yorke Tyrwhitt rose through the ranks and eventually served during the Weltkrieg as commander of the Harwich Force, the squadron which fired the first shots of the war in 1914. Its most famous action under Tyrwhitt's command was the Cuxhaven raid, where sea-planes played a key role in attacking a German port from the air and escaping with no casualties. Tyrwhitt's only major blemish is his commendation of Captain John Knowles Im Thurn prior to his mismanagement causing the Plymouth Riots in 1925. Holding the position of Commander-in-Chief, China, in 1926 during the Northern Expedition Tyrwhitt is at least partially responsible for the evacuation of British forces to Australia and the subsequent "protection" of Hong Kong by the Germans, an act for which he has never quite been forgiven by his fellow Britons."

With the rise of the Three Harmonies Society and their dominance over China secured, the honored Dragon Head of the Triads invited Zhu Yuxun back to Beijing to take his seat at his rightful throne.

#LEC_black_dragon_deal_desc:0 "Xiaolin works with a number of shady characters, but standing behind him is a foreign backer of some sort. We could gain a clue as to their identity if we reach out, and offer to cut a profitable deal to give them what they want..."

lec.1.d:0 "Formed under the shadow of a possible German-Japanese war by American mediation, the International Mandate for the Chinese Concessions, colloquially known as the Legation Cities, is emblematic of both the failure of China to successfully resist foreign imperialism and the American push for the "Open Door" policy, under which all nations should have equal access to one of the world's largest markets. Shanghai's reach goes beyond her limits, and beyond the thirty mile "neutral zone" that has become a haven for criminals, all the way up the Yangtze in a sprawling path of railroads, factories and telegraph lines that forms the beating heart of Chinese industry. Money comes and goes like water in the cities at all levels of society. \n\nTo the north Tianjin is the world's entrepot for Beijing and a thriving hub of railway speculation for all of China, to the south is old Hong Kong: a last guttering ember of British glory kept alive by her fine harbour and access to southern China. At the beating heart of it all lies Shanghai, a diamond plucked from the hands of China and polished to a mirror shine. The Paris of the East is in its heyday, the streets hum with electricity, the opium dens curl with mysterious smoke and the westerners spend money like it is going out of fashion and make it just as fast. \n\nAll of course, is not as it appears. Under the golden surface of Shanghai lies a terrifying underbelly of murder, intrigue and revolution."

Berlin rarely concerns itself below this level, though, and we are mostly responsible for managing most of the German day-to-day and covert activities in the Legation Cities.

The latest step has been to persuade the High Commissioner of [LEC.GetNameDef] to hold a vote on confiscating [BEL.GetName]'s concessions in the name of the Beijing government and removing them from the Legation Council. This could possibly reshape the power dynamic of the Legation Council for years to come."
lec.46.a:0 "We shall vote according to our best interests."
lec.46.b:0 "Those damn Germans!"

lec.47.t:0 "The Results of the Vote on Removing [BEL.GetNameDef]"
lec.47.d:0 "The vote for removing [BEL.GetName] from the Legation Council has expired and it seems that the motion has..."
lec.47.a:0 "Been accepted."
lec.47.b:0 "Been denied!"

lec.48.t:0 "The Status of the Belgian Concessions"
lec.48.d:0 "With the dissolution of the Belgian government, the status of their concessions has fallen into doubt. The Chinese government has consented to grant a new concession to neither the Flemish government nor the Belgian government-in-exile in Canada, and it seems the small Belgian outpost in Tianjin has fallen back into Chinese hands, though it will naturally still be administered by the Legation Cities for now."
lec.48.a:0 "Confiscate that wharehouse!"

lec.49.t:0 "The Legation Cities Confiscate Our Concessions"
lec.49.d:0 "As the legal successor to many of Flanders-Wallonia's overseas commitments, we were expecting to succeed the Belgians in their position on the Legation Council, as well. Instead, it seems that the International Mandate has declared that the concessions have reverted to the Chinese government, and we no longer have any rights or responsibilities in China. Naturally, this is something of a diplomatic disappointment, but at least we don't have to take care of all those Francophones in the Legation Cities any more."
lec.49.a:0 "That's irksome."

lec.50.t:0 "Belgian Concessions Are Confiscated"
lec.50.d:0 "It seems the Legation Council has confiscated Flanders-Wallonia's concessions and removed their ambassador from the Council. Though theoretically their concessions now revert back to us, it is likely that the Legation Council will now administer them, since they lie in the neutral zone in Tianjin. Indeed, it is not impossible that another consular power may attempt to buy them from us or the Council. For now, though, many privately rejoice at the end of one of the unequal treaties."
lec.50.a:0 "Goodbye!"

lec.51.t:0 "Removing Japan from the Legation Council"
lec.51.d:0 "The Japanese are a threat to the stability of Asia, and they must be punished, at least formally. We should remove them from the Legation Council and confiscate the concessions we control, but how?"
lec.51.a:0 "We should vote on it."
lec.51.b:0 "Remove them without a vote."

lec.52.t:0 "We Are Removed from the Legation Council"
lec.52.d:0 "The Legation Council has stepped beyond its bounds completely, apparently. In closed session, without any of our delegates present or informed, the Legation Council has speedily removed the Empire of Japan from the Council! The audacity of this arrangement is furthered by the fact that the Legation Council was originally supposed to be a platform for mediation between ourselves, the Chinese, and the Germans, and now a crucial party is gone. Our government and diplomatic corps have only learned about this development in the morning papers, and we are being called upon by the army to put together a coherent response, one that will doubtless give the military a mandate to strike the Cities and end Western domination of China once and for all."
lec.52.a:0 "This is an outrage!"

lec.53.t:0 "The Legation Council Removes Japan"
lec.53.d:0 "The German High Commissioner, and thus the Legation Council, has removed the Japanese Empire from the Legation Council today. This has predictably infuriated the Japanese, who are demanding an apology and immediate restoration of their rights, both of which seem unlikely. Many nations have already withdrawn their guarantees from the Legation Cities, having no wish to defend the Cities from the probable Japanese attack. What should we do?"
lec.53.a:0 "This was a lawful decision, we shall back Shanghai."
lec.53.b:0 "We must abandon our guarantees!"

lec.54.t:0 "The Legation Council Votes on Confiscating Japan's Concessions"
lec.54.d:0 "Ambassador Bodenheimer has introduced the motion to remove Japan from the Legation Council, and voting has begun. Only time will tell if the Japanese monster will be stopped."
lec.54.a:0 "The Japanese must be contained!"

lec.55.t:0 "The Legation Council Votes on Confiscating Japan's Concessions"
lec.55.d.nojap:0 "The Japanese Empire has been a force of instability in Asia since the end of isolationism, and their assertiveness has been hardly contained by global alliances and treaties since then. Now it seems that even the Legation Cities have failed to stop the Japanese aggression in Asia. The Council has asserted itself and the High Commissioner has started a vote to remove the Japanese from the Council. How should we vote?"
lec.55.d.jap:0 "The Legation Council has treacherously entertained a motion to remove us from the Council! We have done absolutely nothing to merit this treatment, but these westerners seem determined to isolate our great Empire once again. If we are to escape diplomatic isolation, our men in Shanghai must move quickly to prevent this measure from passing."
lec.55.a:0 "We shall consider our options."
lec.55.b:0 "This cannot happen!"

lec.56.a:0 "Passed!"
lec.56.b:0 "Failed."

lec.57.t:0 "The Legation Council Votes Against Us"
lec.57.d:0 "The devious Europeans and Americans have voted to remove us from the Legation Council! Our diplomats have been expelled from the Council chamber, as well as from the municipal councils of the individual Cities. Our forces have also been formally asked to leave the Cities. The government and military are demanding military action to erase this loss of pride!"
lec.57.a:0 "These imperialists know no bounds!"

lec.58.t:0 "The Legation Council Removes Japanese Concessions"
lec.58.d:0 "The Japanese have apparently overstepped their bounds in the Legation Cities, and the Council has removed them. Though there is still much Japanese influence in Manchuria, this is a great day for the prospect of an independent China."
lec.58.a:0 "Another unequal treaty gone!"

lec.59.t:0 "The Imperial Coup in Beijing"
lec.59.d:0 "Instability in the Qing central government seems to have lead to dramatic regime change in Beijing. Power has always been held by Wu Peifu and his Zhili Clique, but now it seems they have lost power to a renewed imperial faction, backed by friendly warlords to the south-east and west. As part of this transition, the new regime has blamed foreign meddling for the prior power struggle, and many in the Legation Cities now fear that a new era of official anti-concessionism has begun in the north. Some now call for withdrawing diplomatic recognition of the Qing government, and recognizing either the Southern Zhili or the Fengtian Cliques as the legitimate government of China."
lec.59.a:0 "Let's hope things get a little better."

lec.60.t:0 "Currency Reserves Exhausted"
lec.60.d:0 "The Legation Council's day-to-day functions rely heavily on the currency reserves in the Shanghai Banking Corporation's vaults. These, unfortunately, have run rather low, and the prevailing uncertainty in the world means that the Cities have almost no credit to run on. Without money, the Legation Cities could probably not continue to function normally. If we do not increase the money in our vault soon, the Council might have to terminate its Mandate."
lec.60.a:0 "Hopefully things won't get that bad."

lec.61.t:0 "The Council Declares Bankruptcy"
lec.61.d:0 "After some days of hard deliberation, the Council had made a decision. The Legation Cities have conclusively failed as a project. There is no money in the reserves, the powers' interests are not being served, and average quality of life is plummeting. Thus, the International Mandate over all Chinese concessions was determined to have ended, and negotiations with the Beijing government would begin. City commissioners vehemently objected to this decision, as well as many bureaucrats, but the ambassadors have left the Council chamber and returned to their own residences, guarded by national troops. In the streets, Japanese and German troops have already begun making aggressive moves, and the Chinese are in the streets all through the Cities. Soon, chaos will overtake us."
lec.61.a:0 "We tried our best."

lec.62.t:0 "The Occupation of Fuzhou"
lec.62.d:0 "The Legation Council has gone bankrupt, spelling an end to the International Mandate. Now, as Shanghai devolves into street fights and chaos, the outlying cities of the Mandate are left unprotected. In Fuzhou, rioters and gangs already have taken control of the streets, and responsible government seems in short supply. Should we reclaim Fuzhou for China?"

Now, as Shanghai devolves into street fights and chaos, the outlying cities of the Mandate are left unprotected. In Tianjin, rioters and gangs have mostly been suppressed, and the city police are slowly regaining control, aided by the Japanese and prominent Triads, all of whom are trying to secure the city for one faction or another. Still, they could hardly put up any opposition to an occupation from the mainland. Should we reclaim Tianjin for China?"

The Japanese are making moves to occupy the city, but we don't know what they'll do yet. It seems they are moving to occupy the docks to wait for reinforcements, so some suggest our troops try to beat them there and secure supply lines. Others suggest that we should remain in the central city and defend from there. What should we do?"

The stated purpose of the group was to advance the cause of socialist realism in China, and they saw no issue with using art to deliver overtly political statements. Indeed, they have frequently had heated debates with the Crescent Moon Society, an influential literary group that argues that art should only be made for art's sake. Recently, however, they have stepped up their propaganda campaign for the Left Kuomintang, and with those fighters still active in Fujian, it has, in the view of some members of the Council and the police, become a threat to the Mandate.

lec.110.d:0 "When the Legation Cities were founded, Russia, as a nation with Chinese concessions, was naturally given voting rights on the Council. Unfortunately, there were two Russias at the time. While Kerenskiy's Russian Republic had more international recognition, Admiral Kolchak's Vladivostok regime was far closer, being able to actually occupy the concessions, and had the support of Tokyo. This resulted in both governments being granted the same sort of observer rights given to the Canadians and Australasians. Now that the eastern [TRM.GetNameDef] is indisputably the only Russia remaining which has any interest in maintaining its position in Tianjin, however, the ambassador from Vladivostok has urged us to restore voting rights to his government. \n\nSince this is quite a substantive matter, it is technically supposed to go through the Legation Council. However, since it is unlikely that Germany, a rival of the Russians and Japanese, would ever let it pass, we can instead simply let the Chair of the Legation Council push it through on a Point of Order. While this would provide a powerful new voter with no ties to the Germans, and would please the Japanese, it would probably upset some powers on the Council."

lec.148.t:0 "The Shanghai Drama"
lec.148.d:0 "In international news, the new hit French drama from Algeria, “La Drama de Shanghai (The Shanghai Drama), hit the box office. Filmed by the acclaimed G.W. Pabst and starring superstars such as Christl Mardayn, Louis Jouvet, and Raymond Rouleau, the film depicts an exiled French aristocrat (played by Christl Mardayn) working as a cabaret singer in Shanghai to support her daughter’s education. Adapted from a novel by Oscar Paul Gilbert, critics have noticed that the film is a commentary of China’s fractious and political state while also highlighting the hedonistic lifestyle of European expatriates and exiles crammed in Shanghai’s international quarters. The main protagonist’s exiled background serves as a reminder of the exiled Britons and Frenchmen in Asia, with their countries fallen to syndicalism. The film also highlights the crime and glory of the Shanghai nightlife featuring a mysterious and conspirational organization called the Black Dragon, which follows a charismatic and nationalistic leader named Cheng, who is determined to drive out westerners and foreign influence China.\n\n Unlike most films centered on Asian themes, the Shanghai Drama boasts an impressive cast of Asians since much of the filming was done beyond Shanghai’s international settlement. Regardless of the film’s political undertones, it is considered a box office success, with critics praising Mardayn’s performance and Pabst’s filmography."

lec.149.d:0 "In the dim lights of Fuzhou Road in Huangpu district, one of Shanghai’s most red-light districts, a new and peculiar form of cooking has achieved popularity among the residents. These businesses have also opened up in Hong Kong, where they are popular among the residents not allowed to eat at western hotels and restaurants. Opened by the Cantonese who have been used to cooking with western and Chinese ingredients, these restaurants employ Chinese cooks who have whipped up their takes on popular western dishes. These dishes, nicknamed 'dacai', or big dishes are a homey fusion of cheap western dishes catered to Chinese taste. Popular items amongst fans of dacai include borscht without beets, baked lasagna with cheese, and deep-fried pork chops with Worcestershire sauce and beef burgundy. In addition to the western dishes, traditional Chinese food serves as a replacement, such as Chinese wine in the absence of western wine or shark fin soup. Meals are often concluded with a western-style apple pie, vanilla pudding, or coffee. In particular, dacai dishes have found popularity amongst prostitutes who hang out at such eateries, looking stylish and hoping to earn a free meal and some business."

lecgreengangclash.1.d:0 "Shanghai's criminal underworld has long been under the control of three mysterious figures who lead a collective known as the "Green Gang". At the head of this alliance is crime lord Du Yuesheng, better known as "Big Ears Du". \n\nYuesheng's iron grip on the opium trade out of Shanghai is long established, and with the establishment of the Legation Cities the route has been opened for him and the Green Gang to muscle in on Hong Kong. The triad gangsters who thrive in the Chinese districts of Hong Kong have pushed back strongly against this attempt, culminating in a clash today between them and Green Gang men at a pleasure house in Hong Kong. Reportedly at least fifty people were involved in an armed clash with machetes, knives and pistols before the police were able to break it up. This has only served to highlight the ongoing problem of criminality in the cities and its potentially destabilising effect."
lecgreengangclash.1.a:0 "How terrible!"

lecgreengangclash.2.t:0 "Murder In Broad Daylight!"
lecgreengangclash.2.d:0 "A grisly event took place in Shanghai today as a member of one of the last rival gangs finally fell foul of the Green Gang. He had apparently been leaving the police station in the German (formerly French) concession after a heated conversation, when a large group of men in western suits and hats ambushed him. After his bodyguards and companion were shot he was subsequently torn apart with axes in an act of mob violence. Despite the extremely accurate accounts circulating about the incident it seems there were absolutely no witnesses, the police at the time being extremely busy."

lecgreengangclash.4.d:0 "The chief of the German police is a very busy man who has limited time to actually investigate petty things like crimes; don't you know the stock market flucuates daily? He needs to pick one particular area of focus for his investigation, or he'll never get anywhere at all."

lecgreengangclash.5.d:0 "German-uniformed gendarmes today alighted in Hong Kong and busted down the doors of an opium den. While the substance itself was a valuable haul for them, the truly interesting thing was found in the safe of the place - financial documents concerning the enterprises used to launder the money and who they were banking with. It suffices to say that suspicion has been aroused."
lecgreengangclash.5.a:0 "Interesting..."

lecgreengangclash.6.t:0 "Some Gangsters Arrested"

lecgreengangclash.7.d:0 "Under intense interrogation by the German police in Shanghai, who had picked him up earlier that day, a member of the notorious Green Gang spilled the beans. He revealed names, dates and places relating to several big operations including prostitution rings, smuggling and arms dealing and they all seemed to tie back to one man - Du Yuesheng. While news of Big Ears Du's crooked ways are nothing new to the police this is the start of being able to put up solid evidence against him."

He has however taken a member of the council on a lovely drive in his Rolls Royce with his new wife, an opera singer 20 years his junior. A stunningly generous man really."

lecgreengangclash.13.t:0 "The Portrait Of A Gangster: Du Yuesheng"
lecgreengangclash.13.d:0 "As we proceed in our investigation into Du Yuesheng, we must first understand his history. Our files tell us the following: Du Yuesheng was born in a poor Chinese village in what is now the neutral zone in 1888, at the age of just four his mother had died in childbirth, his father was dead and his sister sold into slavery. He returned to his village to live with his grandmother. Returning to Shanghai at the age of fourteen he worked at a fruit stall until he was fired for theft, whereupon a job as a bouncer at a brothel brought him into contact with the Green Gang. From there he was introduced to Huang Jinrong, the highest ranked Chinese detective in the former French, now German, concession of Shanghai. Jinrong's wife saw potential in the boy and had him assist on a number of large opium deals, gradually expanding his remit and network of contacts, as well as his wealth. \nIn 1924 when Lu Yongxiang, then in control of most of Shanghai, had Huang Jinrong locked up for publicly beating his son Du found himself filling his shoes and in control of most of the German Concession's criminal enterprises. While Jinrong was released thanks in part to the Green Gang's close relationship with Zhejiang warlord Du would forever more be the most prominent Shanghai gangster. \nDu is colloquially known as "Big Ears Du" for obvious reasons and has an outgoing and gregarious personality, generous to friends but ruthless to foes. The leader of several legitimate businesses, a few of which aren't fronts for illegal dealings, Du is also the head of the Association of Chinese Tax Payers, sits on the board of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and is the sponsor of at least one major temple in Shanghai."

lecgreengangclash.14.t:0 "The Portait Of A Gangster: Huang Jingrong"
lecgreengangclash.14.d:0 "As we proceed in our investigation into our policeman Huang Jinrong, we must first understand his history. Our files tell us the following:Huang Jinrong has been a perenial feature in the Shanghai underworld since 1892, when he joined the police force of the French Concession at the age of 24. Retained and promoted due to his skills as a sleuth, a lack of competent administrators eventually lead the Germans to appoint him Chief of Police in their new concession after the French were removed. Adapting smoothly to his new role the only hiccup came when he was imprisoned illegally for beating Lu Yongxiang's son, which saw Du Yuesheng rise to prominence as the foremost member of the Green Gang in the concession and placed Huang in his debt. \nJinrong is for his part a patient man, seemingly preferring to let the younger Du run the show while he enjoys the vast wealth being his loyal second-in-command brings him. His ex-wife Lin Guisheng was said to be the true brains and ambition behind many of his operations, however in the aftermath of the formation of the International Mandate Jinrong expertly saw that the Green Gang in the German Concession became the dominant group in all of Shanghai, so there must be more to him than just a vast address book."

lecgreengangclash.15.t:0 "The Portait Of A Gangster: Zhang Xiaolin"
lecgreengangclash.15.d:0 "As we proceed in our investigation into Zhang Xioalin, we must first understand his history. Our files tell us the following:Zhang Xiaolin is the dark horse of the Green Gang's Big Three. Born in Zhejiang province right on the outskirts of Shanghai and a graduate of the province's military academy, Xiaolin came to Shanghai in 1912 already well-connected with the provincial warlords that surrounded the city. From there he put those connections to use, working then under Huang Jinrong. With the help of the warlord armies the gang secured control over the trade routes running down the Yangtze river and gained a stranglehold on the city's opium trade. \nWhile he might be key to their prominence, Zhang Xiaolin was passed over by Huang Jingrong and Lin Guisheng for the honour of taking over the most prominent role as head of the Green Gang, a fact Zhang has always resented. As a result of his resentment a growing rift is noted between him and Du Yuesheng, who further distrusts Zhang for his violent nature and the lurid tales about how he treats those who cross him. It may only be a matter of time before the split becomes official, and either Xiaolin or Yuesheng has to go..."

lecshorting.1.d:0 "In the aftermath of Black Monday everybody seems to be licking their financial wounds, everybody, that is, except a group of businessmen, mostly Americans, who took a short position on German government bonds just days before the crash. They have, to use a colloquialism, made out like bandits from the deal. The Ostchina Direktorium has begun to raise a stink about the whole affair after it emerged that the major loser in the short sale was the state-backed Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, the commercial bank of choice for German businessmen, and demanded that there be an investigation into allegations of insider trading!"

lecshorting.2.d:0 "The most pressing issue for the Shanghai business community right now is the tottering Deutsch-Asiatische Bank and its potential collapse.

lecshorting.3.t:0 "Legation Cities Voting: Bailout?"
lecshorting.3.d:0 "Black Monday has left deep scars in the global economy, and particularly on the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank in Shanghai, which seems to have fallen victim to unscrupulous business practices and possibly insider trading.

lecshorting.5.t:0 "Deutsch-Asiatische Collapses!"
lecshorting.5.d:0 "Early this morning a run on Deutsch-Asiatische Bank signalled a death knell for the institution, which was overleveraged with now worthless German government bonds. As a result its operations are now undergoing a semi-orderly collapse and their remaining assets are being auctioned off, which has roused fury from the influential Germans in the Legation Cities over the council's lack of action. It looks like nobody is going to be getting back their money any time soon..."
lecshorting.5.a:0 "Oh, no."

lecshorting.6.t:0 "Deutsch-Asiatische Stabilises!"
lecshorting.6.d:0 "It seems that German's financial lynchpin in the east will remain stable for now, enough security has been found to ensure their future and protect their assets, which has mollified German concerns over insider trading somewhat."
lecshorting.6.a:0 "What a relief."

lecshorting.7.t:0 "German Fury - Heads Must Roll!"
lecshorting.7.d:0 "Following the collapse of their prize bank in the East, the Germans have furiously telegrammed the Legation Council and had their delegation make one thing clear: somebody had better get arrested or deported for this, or else!"

lecshorting.8.d:0 "The Germans, despite being pleased about the rallying of the DAB after Black Monday, are applying considerable pressure for there to be an investigation into what exactly went on with regard to the allegations of insider trading. This is a very serious accusation, and if it emerges that somebody tipped the American businessmen in question off about German monetary policy then they may even need to be extradited..."

Their first action was to launch a surprise raid on the headquarters of the DAB and round up several important Germans for questioning, followed by picking up some Americans who had been involved in the matter. While the Germans are frustrated at the gung-ho, and some say discriminatory, actions of the Japanese others have lauded them for their efforts. While they have been unable to find evidence of insider trading they have supplied valuable information divulged under pressure about the activities of one American notable in the cities..."

lecshorting.10.d:0 "The British have been assigned to the DAB case and after a month of inquiries have returned their report: absolutely no evidence of wrongdoing by the Americans can be found. It would seem they are simply very shrewd businessmen."
lecshorting.10.a:0 "Are you sure?"

lecshorting.11.t:0 "Huang Jinrong Is On The Case!"
lecshorting.11.d:0 "It would seem that Huang Jingrong has been able to pull off the impossible, within days he had made an arrest among the German business community, embarrassing them thoroughly, and uncovered information passed to several American businessmen. Multiple traders have thus been barred for life from any respectable stock exchange and the implication of Germans has cast doubt across their strict, law abiding image."
lecshorting.11.a:0 "Huzzah!"

lecshorting.12.t:0 "HSBC Buys Deutsch-Asiatische Stock"
lecshorting.12.d:0 "In a surprising move today the Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation purchased a large stake in Deutsch-Asiatische Bank, a bullish move despite the current economic downturn. How exactly they managed to secure the sale so quickly remains to be seen, but some are convinced that it is linked with the Hong-Kong Police Department's recent probe into the trading scandal."
lecshorting.12.a:0 "Strange move."

lecshorting.13.t:0 "The Japanese Investigate"
lecshorting.13.d:0 "The Japanese investigation has been uncharacteristically demure, possibly due to a lack of German pressure denying them the right to conduct certain raids or detain individuals for excessive lengths of time. Either way they've uncovered some interesting information, particularly regarding one Lothar Eisenträger..."
lecshorting.13.a:0 "Oh my."

lecshorting.14.t:0 "Huang Jinrong Is On The Case!"
lecshorting.14.d:0 "Within a few days of starting his investigation Huang Jingrong has made an arrest, an American businessman is now in custody and the papers of the DAB are being looked over. There is apparently no evidence of any wrongdoing by anybody else. By the way have you met Mr. Jinrong's new wife? She wears the finest jewellery."
lecshorting.14.a:0 "There's something fishy here..."

lecshorting.15.t:0 "The British Enquiry"
lecshorting.15.d:0 "After a few weeks of investigation by officials from Hong Kong it would seem no wrongdoing can be found. Alas, these are troubled times, but at least the council has been shown to be an effective force in keeping the city clean."

lecbrits.1.t:0 "British Concern Over Shanghai-Centrism"
lecbrits.1.d:0 "A consortium of British businessmen has submitted a formal statement today in response to our planned tram construction in Shanghai, asking that investment in Shanghai and Hong Kong be equalised. While this is obviously too bold of a demand they probably intend, if engaged in discussion, to dial down to simply requesting that some sort of increased investment in Hong Kong be pushed forward. It is likely that if we do not agree to help them here, they will reach out to the British Crown, which may attempt to take an active role in the politics of the Cities. However, if we give them what they want, it is anticipated that we shall hear little further from them."

lecbrits.3.t:0 "Germans Accuse the Council of Favouritism"
lecbrits.3.d:0 "The German interest groups in the Legation Cities have expressed consternation at what they feel is favouritism displayed towards Hong Kong and British interests in general, with the Tsingtau Latest News publishing multiple scathing polemics about the corruption inherent in the council. It's clear they want the funding for new projects outside of Shanghai and Tianjin pulled, in order to demonstrate even-handedness."

lecbrits.4.t:0 "British Outraged"
lecbrits.4.d:0 "The British are outraged and the Hong Kong press has once again bemoaned the unfairness of the arrangements foisted upon them after the revolution at home.

lecbrits.7.t:0 "Syndicalist Protests?"
lecbrits.7.d:0 "A bombing of a police station today underscored just how tense the situation in Shanghai can grow very quickly.

It claims that if we are to be responsible for the cities we must be responsible to the Chinese people, and states that [QIE.GetLeader] is beginning to wonder if the current authorities are truly doing their duty. Without saying it too openly, he has effectively questioned the mandate of the Legation Council."

lecbrits.10.t:0 "Unrest in Hong Kong"
lecbrits.10.d:0 "It seems that discontent against the Legation Cities has soared in Hong Kong, as prominent Hongkonger businessmen's pleas for funding were rejected by the Legation Council. Many in the city are speaking with nostalgia of the days Hong Kong belonged to the British Crown. We should exploit this opportunity before it passes."
lecbrits.10.a:0 "And quickly!"

lecbrits.11.a:0 "We should stay informed."

lecbrits.12.t:0 "Hong Kong Unrest Smoothed Over"
lecbrits.12.d:0 "It seems that burgeoning unrest in Hong Kong against the perceived Shanghai-centrism of the Legation Council has been suppressed by Shanghai. They have promised to prioritize equal funding between Hong Kong and Shanghai, and have even gone so far as to cancel the railroad in Shanghai that started the trouble. The entire incident has probably served to eliminate any opportunity for renewed influence we might have exerted over Hong Kong."
lecbrits.12.a:0 "Damn and blast!"

lecbrits.13.t:0 "Appointing a New Hong Kong Governor"
lecbrits.13.d:0 "Though Hong Kong has been out of our grasp since 1925 when we asked for German protection for our concessions, we have always held the territory legally. Even when it became administered by the Legation Council, we kept theoretical ownership of the whole city as one concession among many. \n\nOne thing that has always stayed constant is our right to appoint a governor in Hong Kong, but we have not done so in over a decade. The current Acting Administrator of Hong Kong is Norman Lockhart Smith, but though he is undoubtedly loyal to the Crown, he does have local connections that would possibly lead him to act more independently than we could prefer. We could easily earmark him as our candidate for High Commissioner of the Legation Cities, and thus find a way to make him accept his removal and replacement by Mark Aitchison Young, a more loyal civil servant currently stationed in the West Indies Federation. Alternatively, we could appoint Young to be our future voice in Shanghai, and keep Smith in his current position. Who should we choose?"
lecbrits.13.a:0 "Smith has served us well in Hong Kong."

lecbrits.14.d:0 "It would seem the British continue to extend their influence. They have contacted the Governor of Hong Kong, Norman Lockhart Smith, and have also appointed a new Consul in Shanghai, Mark Aitchison Young. He is now responsible for all British Concessions in China beyond Hong Kong, and it is anticipated the Canadians may soon begin to take more extreme actions to renew their influence. Norman Lockhart Smith is a man of the status quo, however, and he would lose much if it were to change. We could possibly stop the British plots in their tracks if we leant on him in some way."
lecbrits.14.a:0 "This is nothing worthy of comment."
lecbrits.14.b:0 "We should investigate Hong Kong and lean on Administrator Smith."

lecbrits.15.t:0 "The British Appoint a New Governor for Hong Kong"
lecbrits.15.d:0 "The British have appointed Mark Aitchison Young as the new governor of Hong Kong, and have switched the former governor of Hong Kong, Norman Lockhart Smith, to be their ambassador in Shanghai, a position that was previously empty since the British withdrawal in 1926."

lecbrits.16.t:0 "Investigating the British in Hong Kong"
lecbrits.16.d:0 "The British presence in the Cities has been growing for some months now, and their appointment of a new ambassador to Shanghai is worrying many Legation Council members, who fear that the British may soon attempt to re-assert themselves on the Council, or far more worryingly restore British rule to Hong Kong. Should we send someone to investigate Acting Administrator Smith's ties to the Crown?"

lecbrits.17.d:0 "Du Yuesheng's men have broken into some houses and conducted some interrogations, and the Triad seems confident he is on the way to finding out what the British are up to in Hong Kong. He currently believes that the Hongkongers might be trying to return to the fold of the British Empire by inviting Australasian or Canadian troops to occupy the city. He claims his men can get the results they need if they are granted permission to question Governor Smith. Should we let him proceed?"
lecbrits.17.a:0 "Go ahead."
lecbrits.17.b:0 "It's too dangerous."

lecbrits.18.t:0 "Huang Jinrong's Conclusions"
lecbrits.18.d:0 "Huang Jinrong appears to have hired several prominent Hongkonger businessmen to investigate the British Crown's activities in Hong Kong. He now has presented evidence to the High Commissioner that seems to implicate prominent Japanese businessmen in a plot to get Britain back onto the Legation Council. This might seem highly suspect, but Huang Jinrong just invited you on a trip down-town, and you wouldn't want to ruin the mood..."

lecbrits.18.b:0 "This is obviously a lie."

lecbrits.19.t:0 "The Japanese Commission Wraps Up"
lecbrits.19.d:0 "The Japanese have found interesting pieces of evidence, many of which point to the British Crown attempting to regain their voting rights on the Legation Council. Our investigators have posited that a meeting with Governor Smith of Hong Kong could help them identify the full details of the plot. Should we allow the Japanese to proceed?"
lecbrits.19.a:0 "Send the Japanese in to deal with Smith."
lecbrits.19.b:0 "They're just helping themselves."

lecbrits.20.t:0 "The Confrontation With Governor Smith"
lecbrits.20.d:0 "Our agents have emerged from Governor Smith's house with startling news: the British are trying to both take back Hong Kong for the Crown and reclaim their voting rights on the Legation Council. These would drastically change the status quo of the Legation Cities and Hong Kong, radical changes that Governor Smith would prefer to avoid. He has assured our investigators and the Commissioner that he would be willing to obfusticate British plans to reconquer Hong Kong, if necessary, though he expects a healthy stipend in return."
lecbrits.20.a:0 "Thank you for your time, sir."

lecbrits.25.t:0 "Australasia Democratizes"
lecbrits.25.d:0 "The Australasian Confederation has been ruled by the authoritarian hand of Governor-General Birdwood for twelve years. Now, however, it seems that the Crown has granted leave for new elections to be held. It is unlikely that radicals, even if elected, will be allowed to remain long, and so this news has bought the British some support in the Cities."
lecbrits.25.a:0 "Stability is good for business."

lecbrits.26.t:0 "Australasia Falls to Radicals"
lecbrits.26.d:0 "Canberra has been organizing the British in our territory with a view of retaking Hong Kong or reclaiming the British voting rights. Now that Australasia is no longer in a position to protect them, having fallen to radicalism, this has dissuaded some from their efforts to regain the Crown's protection."
lecbrits.26.a:0 "This should slow their progress."

lecbrits.27.t:0 "A Royal Visit to Hong Kong"
lecbrits.27.d:0 "Today the HMS Sussex arrived in Hong Kong from Halifax with royal passengers - Prince Albert of Windsor and his young daughter, Princess Elizabeth. High Commissioner [LEC.GetLeader] and several other ambassadors and representatives to the Legation Council stood at the end of the dock to meet him. After some brief formalities, the Prince and his entourage got in a taxicab and drove quickly to the Peninsula Hong Kong hotel, citing his daughter's seasickness as the reason for the hasty departure. It is anticipated that he will have several meetings with important British officials and businessmen in Hong Kong throughout the month-long stay, as well as some tours about the city and its outskirts. Given the Prince's dislike for large public gatherings, however, it is unlikely that he will advertise these outings much."
lecbrits.27.a:0 "Welcome to the Legation Cities, Your Royal Highness."

lecbrits.28.t:0 "Our Place on the Legation Council"
lecbrits.28.d:0 "Our membership in the Legation Council, on behalf of Hong Kong, has now been passed on."

lecbrits.29.d:0 "Hong Kong is a British part of [LEC.GetNameDef], and thus it now falls to us to be the caretaker of the colony and its membership in the council."
lecbrits.29.a:0 "We will do what we can"

lecbrits.30.t:0 "British Volunteers Arrive"
lecbrits.30.d:0 "Today, a thousand volunteers from across the British Empire in Asia arrived in Hong Kong to sign up for the defence force. Many of them were officers in Australasia, India, and Malaya, so they received officer commissions for the defence force as well. Unfortunately, both their presence within the defence force and the ceremony that accompanied the new recruits has lead to an up-tick in British patriotism and allegiance in Hong Kong."
lecbrits.30.a:0 "We can always use more men, I suppose."

lecbrits.31.t:0 "Bringing Hong Kong Back Into the Empire"
lecbrits.31.d:0 "Now that we are able to make our move, and the Legation Cities are in turmoil, it would be possible to move back into Hong Kong, and reclaim the city for the Empire. Some argue, however, that this move would alienate us internationally, as many nations do not recognize the presence of a responsible British government. Should we send the fleet?"
lecbrits.31.a:0 "Hong Kong shall be returned to the fold!"
lecbrits.31.b:0 "This would isolate us internationally."

lecbrits.32.t:0 "The British Deploy Troops in Hong Kong!"
lecbrits.32.d:0 "The British appear to have mustered everything they could in the Legation Cities for an operation to reoccupy Hong Kong. They have sailed part of the Royal Navy into the harbor, raised the flag over Kowloon, and called on the Governor to support them. If we have any influence in that quarter, we need to use it now to stop this invasion!"
lecbrits.32.a:0 "Withdraw the Volunteer Force, at least."

Today our troops disembarked in Hong Kong and were met by the Governor who promised to acquiesce to our returned rule. Unfortunately, the Legation Cities have voted to reclaim this crucial port and have attacked us. We can, however, still celebrate the fact that another small part of the world is painted red once more!"
lecbrits.33.a:0 "God Save the King!"

lecbrits.34.t:0 "Hong Kong Unrest Ends"
lecbrits.34.d:0 "While there has been some unrest in Hong Kong for the past couple of months, our police and garrison in the city have reported that the people have now come to accept the rule of the returned Empire. Some are even signing up for the Royal Navy!"

lecbrits.35.t:0 "Smith Succeeds"
lecbrits.35.d:0 "Governor Smith has successfully defused the British loyalists in his administration, and they have informed the British administrators sent to occupy the city that they do not require their services. Our deal with Governor Smith has paid in dividends."
lecbrits.35.a:0 "Good man."

lecbrits.36.t:0 "Smith Betrays Us!"
lecbrits.36.d:0 "It seems that Governor Smith took our money and broke his promises! He has accepted the return of the British Crown with open arms, and with our forces in disarray we can do nothing."
lecbrits.36.a:0 "Bastard."

lecbrits.37.t:0 "Governor Smith Betrays Us"
lecbrits.37.d:0 "When our troops arrived in Hong Kong, they were greeted by Governor Smith, who privately informed our officials that he would by no means condone a British return. It is rumoured that the High Commissioner has bought his loyalty."
lecbrits.37.a:0 "Call off the occupation."

lecbrits.40.t:0 "British Voting Rights in the Legation Cities"
lecbrits.40.d:0 "When the Legation Council was created in 1928, the British were granted observer rights only, since Germany and Japan refused to recognize the government in Ottawa as a 'responsible British government.' Now that we have amassed a good deal of influence in the Cities, however, we are in a position to convince the Legation Council that our cause is just. We shall persuade the Austrian ambassador, as an uninterested third party, to motion for a restoration of our rights."
lecbrits.40.a:0 "Let us ask Shanghai for our rights."

lecbrits.41.t:0 "Restoration of the British Voting Rights"
lecbrits.41.d:0 "When the Legation Council was created in 1928, the United Kingdom, as the power with the most concessions in China, was naturally given a seat on the council. However, since Germany and Japan refused to recognize Ottawa as a "responsible British government," the British were given only observer rights. Now we have an opportunity to rectify that mistake, and the British lobby has been pressuring us to grant them their rights back. Today the Austrian ambassador, possibly bribed by the British, raised the issue, and the only choice left to us is whether to allow a vote on the subject or grant the request out of hand."
lecbrits.41.a:0 "The Council must vote on it."

However, since Germany and Japan refused to recognize Ottawa as a 'responsible British government,' the British were given only observer rights. Now, however, it seems that British influence in the Cities is sufficient to get the Council to reconsider restoring the British vote. Now the Council votes on the matter..."
lecbrits.42.a:0 "We shall vote wisely."

lecbrits.43.t:0 "The Legation Council Votes on Restoring Our Vote"
lecbrits.43.d:0 "Our government has heard from our ambassador in Shanghai that the Legation Council plans to vote on restoring our voting rights, denied at in 1928 by Germany and Japan on the grounds of a lack of 'responsible British government.' The ambassador states that is probable that we will be granted our rights, notwithstanding earlier Russian attempts ending in defeat."

However, since Germany and Japan refused to recognize Ottawa as a 'responsible British government,' the British were given only observer rights. Now, however, it seems that British influence in the Cities is sufficient to get the Council to reconsider restoring the British vote. The Austrian ambassador, rumoured to have been bribed by the British, today raised the issue, and it was accepted by the High Commissioner without a vote. It seems the British are back on the Council"
lecbrits.45.a:0 "And we weren't even consulted?"

lecbrits.46.t:0 "The Legation Council Restores Our Voting Rights"
lecbrits.46.d:0 "The Legation Cities only came to be because of Britain's inability to maintain her concessions after the collapse of the Empire. When we invited Germany to occupy Hong Kong in 1925, we could hardly have imagined the near total loss of influence we suffered throughout the next decade. We were never even granted any voting rights on the Legation Council, even though our concessions were the most numerous. Now, though, it seems the Legation Council has rectified their mistake. Today, our ambassador in Shanghai was granted voting rights after a tense debate. We have a share in China once again."
lecbrits.46.a:0 "Three cheers for the Empire!"

lecbrits.47.t:0 "The Legation Council Votes Against Restoring Our Rights"
lecbrits.47.d:0 "It seems the Legation Council has rallied against the Austrian ambassador's motion to restore our voting rights. We shall have to wait for a better opportunity, and many recommend abandoning the idea of regaining our voting rights at all, instead focusing on retaking Hong Kong."
lecbrits.47.a:0 "Damn them!"

lecbrits.50.t:0 "The Legation Cities Ask for Protection"
lecbrits.50.d:0 "Though the Legation Cities have a web of international guarantees of their security, obviously these were not enough for them. They have approached the British Crown for protection, and claim they will be strong bulwark of our alliance in East Asia. Many in Parliament, however, claim that this would only expose us to attack by the Japanese."

lecbrits.53.d:0 "As our war with the International Mandate for the Chinese Concessions rages on, the [FROM.GetAdjective]s have seen an opportunity to retake their former colony of Hong Kong. The Royal Navy's marines have now occupied Kowloon and the New Territories, and the governor has accepted the return of the Crown. While this has weakened our enemies in Shanghai, this also means we will not be acquiring the port ourselves once the Cities fall."

lecjapfeud.1.t:0 "Gang Skirmish in Tianjin"
lecjapfeud.1.d:0 "For the most part, the buzzing streets of Tianjin have been spared from the turmoil that has afflicted the rest of China. While anything but calm, this Paris of the Orient has been more accustomed to fireworks than the battles-scarred cities to the west. Today however, the citizens of the city had their daily affairs interrupted as they were treated to a taste of the region's conflicts right at their doorstep.\n\nIt quickly became evident that this was no ordinary heist or criminal dispute as shots were exchanged in a busy street crossing near the diplomatic quarters. Four groups of men in suits, numbering about a dozen total, were exchanging fire before taking off. They managed to escape by mixing in with the panicked crowds, successfully using the general chaos of the situation to evade law enforcement. Two of the criminals were left dead on the ground, and with nothing to tie anyone to a motive or an organization for the time being the police are left struggling to solve this one. Although an embarrassment for the Tianjin police department, the chief of police has ordered an increase in police presence in the area to root out the gangsters. At the very least, we should be thankful that no innocent people were injured in the crossfire."
lecjapfeud.1.a:0 "Catch those crooks!"

lecjapfeud.2.t:0 "Escalation of Sectional Disputes"
lecjapfeud.2.d:0 "Mere days after the last skirmish, Tianjin was rocked again by another gun battle, this time within the diplomatic quarters itself. Luckily, the increased police presence prevented a repeat of the last public shooting. Their findings in its aftermath are, however, quite alarming.\n\nOnce more, the criminals had gathered in a similar fashion. Only this time, the Tianjin Police Department were able to both observe them before the crime and intervene as things went south. Two gangsters met one-another outside of a cafe and spoke to one another, exchanged a briefcase, and were then assaulted by a group of six men armed with revolvers, seemingly vying for whatever was in the suitcase. What followed almost seemed like it would be more befitting of a crime flick than real life as the stick-up was met by half four armed crooks on either side of them opening fire at the presumptive thieves as they realized all too late that their victims weren't alone. Even worse for all of them, the police were quick to intervene before any further tragedies could be had, and luckily enough all men gave up the moment they realized that they couldn't fight their way past half of Tianjin's police force. While most were tight-lipped about it, the contents of the briefcase gave away that the men are hired guns from local Triads acting as middlemen in a larger dispute, although the contents of the briefcase didn't give away who or what right away. After the suspects were subjected to lengthy interrogations, however, one eventually snapped and ratted them all out. They were acting on behalf of the Japanese embassy, but it gets more convoluted from there on. One group were acting on behalf of the navy attaché, another group from the colonial office, and yet another acting for the Japanese foreign affairs department. We suspect that more departments of the Japanese may be involved as well, but we have no concrete proof at the time being.\n\nThe fact the Japanese have factional disputes is not news to us, but it hasn't gotten this bad in public before. Now comes the difficult choice in deciding how to deal with this situation. We could intervene directly into the matter, although we should be mindful that doing so could open a bigger can of worms than simply letting this factional dispute die down on its own would."
lecjapfeud.2.a:0 "Intervene!"
lecjapfeud.2.b:0 "Let it simmer down."

lecjapfeud.3.t:0 "How to Intervene?"
lecjapfeud.3.d:0 "While it's clear that we have to act, it's less clear as to how we should make our move. Various officers in the police force have come forward, but they all seem to fall on two sides of the same debate. There are the ones that want an official intervention through public channels, and another group that insists that keeping things out of the public eye is essential. During the discussions, both sides made salient points. The prior put an emphasis on adherence to rules and that matters of this importance should be handled professionally and that not doing so would be tantamount to 'stooping to their level'. The other side countered by leaning in on practicality and the better chance of success if things are handled with discretion, noting that the Japanese factions involved are likely to merely dig in their heels if publicly pressured. \n\nWhen all was said and done, the decision was made to..."
lecjapfeud.3.a:0 "Attempt an official mediation."
lecjapfeud.3.b:0 "Handle this behind the scenes."

lecjapfeud.4.t:0 "Our Investigation Is Ignored by Japan"
lecjapfeud.4.d:0 "In a rather disappointing and embarrassing turn of events, our efforts to publicly intervene through official channels has been utterly stonewalled by the Japanese who outright refused to cooperate on the matter. The results so far have merely been strained relations and tensions between the camps, someone no one is happy with. After several weeks of trying, it's likely that continuing with this approach won't yield any different results either.\n\nAfter this fiasco, most seem ready to cut their losses and drop the issue, albeit reluctantly. A small but vocal contingent insists, however, that if they're insistent on hiding their activities then there most be a good reason for it, urging that we investigate them in secret."
lecjapfeud.4.a:0 "Drop the issue."
lecjapfeud.4.b:0 "Secretly investigate them."

lecjapfeud.5.t:0 "Hiring an Investigator"
lecjapfeud.5.d:0 "Since we've chosen to investigate the matter, we must decide who we should hire to do the job. Needless to say, we ought to consider our choices carefully as we can't afford afford another blunder. Our first option is to hire Huang Jinrong, a Chinese detective with underground ties that has worked with the council in the past. Our past working relation coupled with him not harboring any political biases for or against the Japanese makes him an obvious choice to some. His ties to the underground can, however, be seen as a double-edged sword if we're unlucky.\n\nIn the light of these concerns, some say that it would be more prudent to go for someone with a cleaner record. They have suggested the expertise of both American and German investigation bureau's operating in the region. While they have outstanding track records and are likely to thoroughly and professionally investigate the matter, their expertise lies more in white collar crime and may therefore be less suited for dealing with the Triads. There is also the matter of potential political biases, which we also need to consider. We only have one shot at getting to the bottom of this, so we have to make this investigation count."
lecjapfeud.5.a:0 "Huang Jinrong will get to the bottom of this!"
lecjapfeud.5.b:0 "Hire the best American gumshoe in Shanghai!"
lecjapfeud.5.c:0 "The Germans are, if nothing else, thorough. Hire them!"

lecjapfeud.6.t:0 "The Investigation Goes Nowhere"
lecjapfeud.6.d:0 "Much to our frustration, Huang Jinrong has so far not turned up any leads. After a long period of radio silence he's finally contacted us again only to inform us that he's managed to turn up nothing but dead ends. While the long period without results has no doubt been as frustrating to him, he insists that the trial has gone cold, likely due to the amount of heat that the last fight and the public humiliation brought on by our publicly applied pressure. While a conclusive end to the investigation seems unlikely at this point, if what he says is true it should at least mean that we're not going to see any further escalations on this matter. Be that as it may, the investigation continues."
lecjapfeud.6.a:0 "Something seems shady about this..."

lecjapfeud.7.t:0 "Huang Jinrong Raises Suspicions"
lecjapfeud.7.d:0 "Shortly after his reports to us, the police commissioner of Tianjin raised the alarm that 'pockmarked' Huang Jinrong himself may be implicated in this matter through his ties to the Green Gang, itself also implicated in the matter. The suspicion was raised when he seemed to deliberately and repeatedly omitted details in his recent reports which the Tianjin police knew to be the case. Because of this, the investigation is now turning around towards the supposed investigator himself with the Tianjin police department already on the case.\n\nIt may not have gone as planned, we have at least found our crook and been able to start shutting down the Triad activity tied to this case. If nothing else, the investigation has managed to direct the heat against the Chinese criminal interests in the cities. This should also push the Japanese fighting behind the scenes, at least for now, as their alleged Triad contacts are feeling the heat."
lecjapfeud.7.a:0 "You just can't find good help these days."

lecjapfeud.8.t:0 "Financial Crimes Uncovered"
lecjapfeud.8.d:0 "The American investigation was quick to bear fruit. With a heavy focus on financial transactions and economic interests as it pertains to the Japanese factions that sparked this whole situation, the bureau claims to be close to making a breakthrough. Apparently, the business interests tied to the Japanese did not cover their tracks."
lecjapfeud.8.a:0 "Finally, some good news!"

lecjapfeud.9.t:0 "Lothar Eisentrager Implicated"
lecjapfeud.9.d:0 "Rather surprisingly, the investigation has had a breakthrough that uncovered something we did not expect. Lothar Eisentrager, a major German figure in the legations, has been implicated in this affair. Having had ties to the Japanese businesses that were financially tied to the disputes, the eyes of the law enforcement are now on him and the illicit financial activities he was tied to. As an added bonus, the heat being brought down on these business ties seems to have forced the Japanese factions to settle their disputes behind the scenes rather than on the streets."
lecjapfeud.9.a:0 "And that's the end of that!"

lecjapfeud.10.t:0 "Investigations into Chinese Markets"
lecjapfeud.10.d:0 "The German bureau that we hired to investigate the matter has focused on financial crimes pertaining to the broader Chinese markets, believing that this is where they'd be most likely to find leads from a shady transaction. They seem to have been correct about their assessments, and are at this moment pursuing numerous leads. We should be seeing positive results in the near future."
lecjapfeud.10.a:0 "Better than nothing."

lecjapfeud.11.t:0 "Connections to Zhejiang Uncovered"
lecjapfeud.11.d:0 "The German investigation has wound its way beyond the Legation Cities into Zhejiang and Fujian, the domain of the Kuomintang bandits. It seems that the Japanese-funded gangs were KMT proxies the Japanese used to eliminate their rivals within the Japanese structure. On their recommendation, we have increased security in Shantou and Ningbo and the Japanese activity has seemingly quieted."
lecjapfeud.11.a:0 "The Germans blamed the socialists, what a surprise..."

lecjapfeud.12.t:0 "Unofficial Mediation"
lecjapfeud.12.d:0 "Discretion is sometimes the better option, even if it may not entirely line up with protocol. Now then, we must choose which intermediary to go through. Although under the control of the Japanese Consulate, the China Agency would be an obvious choice as it would provide a direct and discreet channel of communications with the Japanese. Some claim, however, that approaching them would mean that we'd be dealing on Japanese terms. Although unorthodox, they suggest that going through the Triads using the leads we got from our earlier investigations. Going through them, we could be able to put more direct pressure on the Japanese in our dealings with them as they have relied on these Triads to do their inter-factional dirty work for now."
lecjapfeud.12.a:0 "Go through the China Agency."
lecjapfeud.12.b:0 "Use the Triads as middlemen."

lecjapfeud.13.t:0 "Contacting the Triads"
lecjapfeud.13.d:0 "Contacting the Triads is not without risks, so let's hope we've made the right choice. Our options, based on the information we got from the arrests that the police made earlier, seem to be either Du Yuesheng or Zhang Xiaolin. Du is lower on the rung and has a notable role in the red light scene in Shanghai. Allegedly, some of the hired guns answer to him. Zhang on the other hand is probably the largest crime boss active in the Legations. Anything that could be tied to the Japanese involvement has likely passed through him at some point."
lecjapfeud.13.a:0 "Approach Du Yuesheng, he's tied to this."
lecjapfeud.13.b:0 "Zhang Xiaolin holds the cards, contact him." #NOTE: How do you know that this is a bad idea? This event from T to A2 has a combined letter count of 666! D: - Rei VL, author of this event chain's loc.

lecjapfeud.14.t:0 "Triads Backstab Us!"
lecjapfeud.14.d:0 "Our dealing with the Triads blew up in our faces! They sold us out to the Japanese and are extorting us over our dealings with them. To say that this limits our ability to act on the matter would be an understatement..."
lecjapfeud.14.a:0 "They want HOW much to keep this quiet?!"

lecjapfeud.15.t:0 "Escalation of Violence"
lecjapfeud.15.d:0 "We hoped that the violence would die down after the last incident. Instead, our inaction towards any of the main parties in this dispute has allowed them to continue their fighting. Yesterday an incident similar to the one that started this occurred, and today there was an arson attack against the residence of a member of the Japanese department for colonial affairs, no doubt tied to the brewing miniature war between these branches of the Japanese government any military. With the way things are going, the Tianjin police department is requesting more resources to deal with the spike in violence."
lecjapfeud.15.a:0 "Deploy extra police from Shanghai!"

lecjapfeud.16.t:0 "Gangs Used As Proxies"
lecjapfeud.16.d:0 "As the violence escalates, it's becoming increasingly obvious that the Japanese military factions are hiring Triads and other Chinese gangs to fight their battles against each other for them. The fighting reached a fever pitch in recent days, and only the arrival of more police from other parts of the Legations seem to have had a marginal calming effect on things. Their investigators seem to believe, however, that a more likely reason for the gradual decrease in violence is because one of the factions is close to winning."

With the conflict defused, business as usual soon returned to the cities.\n\nAlthough some are unhappy with this development as it means that the infighting that put a cap on the growth of Japanese influence has diminished thanks to this new inter-agency cooperation and bolstered role of the China Agency, most are just happy that further tragedy was averted."

The 1936 election has borne a strange result, the election of the Progressive George Norris. It would seem that, hoping to preserve American democracy, the Republican and Democratic Parties have been voted out for the first time in order to defeat the radical threat.

Many democratically-aligned officials have fled to regroup in the West under the banner of [PSA.GetNameDef], where they have denounced all who seek to destroy the American way of life. With such chaos in the United States, the people of the Legation Cities have lost all hope they might ever have had for American power and influence coming to aid the Cities in need, and public confidence in the American-run Council has plummeted still further."

lecyankded.11.d:0 "As many have anticipated since the crisis in American politics began, the United States have fallen into civil war yet again. This has created a power vacuum in the Far East, as America was one of the strongest proponents of the status quo, and its embodiment in the Legation Cities. With them temporarily out of the picture, the very fundamental nature of the Cities will undoubtedly change radically. The first thing to be decided by the Council is what the new voting arrangements for America are, and more importantly which America we are to recognize. If the American voting rights are removed, it is likely that a new High Commissioner will then be elected by the Council. What is sure is that these will be uncertain times for the Mandate."

He argued that the United States was sure to emerge from the civil war even stronger than before, and that they would surely come to Shanghai’s aid at any time. This notion was almost universally derided throughout the Council, and Pyotr Tiedemann, the Russian representative, was heard to mutter to his neighbor that ‘the Americans are a spent force in Asia forever.’\n\nAny effect the surprise of proffering his own nation as a dark horse candidate might have provided was soon robbed of him, as the British ambassador rose to speak.

The police have already began an investigation and have pointed the finger at the native Chinese and have promised that this just another act of the anti-concessionist movement. The Chinese themselves are incensed they are taking the blame and have claimed dark forces are at work from beyond the shadows."
lectianjap.3.a:0 "Well that was a speedy investigation."

lectianjap.4.t:0 "Rioting In Tianjin!"
lectianjap.4.d:0 "Following the terrorist attack in Tianjin, the Japanese forces have shown great eagerness in their own crackdown on anti-concessionist forces, often surpassing the official investigators in brutality, angering an already incensed population. The tensions have finally hit a crisis with mass rioting engulfing the city. The Japanese delegation in Shanghai has warned that with the situation continuing to spiral out of control, the Empire will have no choice but to take 'pre-emptive action' in doing what we cannot. Meanwhile the authorities in Tianjin have taking executive action and began dealing with the rioters themselves, promising some semblance of reform. While much of the council is prepared to turn a blind eye, others and especially Japan have called for this to be vetoed, citing that this is in direct dispute of the Council's mandate."
lectianjap.4.a:0 "Veto them, we don't want to anger the council"
lectianjap.4.b:0 "Keep the reforms to a minimum..."

lectianjap.5.t:0 "Terrorist Attack In Tianjin Foiled!"
lectianjap.5.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning, an explosive device failed to detonate properly and the Tianjin police were able to disarm it before the bomb could any real harm. A manhunt for the terrorist has already begun though with little evidence as to may have planted it there isn't much hope for a speedy investigation or a good result. Huang Jinrong has been called upon to investigate the attempted bombing, though the German delegation has proposed their own investigative team take charge citing Huang's less than scrupulous methods."
lectianjap.5.a:0 "I don't care who investigates it, I want the head of the terrorist on my desk!"

lectianjap.6.t:0 "Arms Shipment Discovered!"
lectianjap.6.d:0 "During a routine custom's inspection of a ship docking in Shanghai, a massive cache of weapons has been discovered with all of the crew aboard being put under arrest until further notice with the ship officially seized. An official investigation is under way and is expected to get some results soon."
lectianjap.6.a:0 "Never a dull day in Shanghai!"

lectianjap.7.t:0 "Japanese Guns In A Russian Ship"
lectianjap.7.d:0 "The investigation has finally returned and gathered up all the evidence available to them. The ship itself is Russian in origin, registered to a shipping company in Vladivostok but the guns are Japanese in nature and comprised mostly out of obsolete Arisakas. The crew have given no useful leads and it appears we will have to track this down to the source, either investigating the shipping company in Vladivostok or calling on the Japanese to assist."
lectianjap.7.a:0 "Authorize an official investigation, lets get to the bottom of this!"

lectianjap.8.t:0 "A Warm Day In Vladivostok"
lectianjap.8.d:0 "Our agents in the Russian port city of Vladivostok have recently contacted us with an interesting lead. After having obtained manifests from the shipping company it appears that the arms were being sold to the China Agency with Japan using the Russian shipping route to clear suspicion and launder the weapons. Now with this evidence our agents in the Legations can begin an official investigation into the China Agency."
lectianjap.8.a:0 "Something strange is afoot..."

lectianjap.9.t:0 "The Investigation Gets Stonewalled"
lectianjap.9.d:0 "The Japanese have been less than cooperative with our detectives, either outright refusing to help or giving vague or downright bizarre answers. It seems that the Japanese will be of no help in this investigation and we will to go down other avenues of investigation...The Green Gang are the obvious choice, assuming their leaders haven't been incarcerated."
lectianjap.9.a:0 "The Green Gang don't seem like too bad fellows..."

lectianjap.10.t:0 "Japanese Intrigue In China"
lectianjap.10.d:0 "With an official investigation of the China Agency having gone under way we have finally reached the bottom of these arms shipments and it appears that the Japanese are arming loyal collaborators in preparation for a full scale invasion and occupation of China. Now that the genie is out of the bottle we will have to pick a side, either offering the Japanese a deal or attempting to crackdown on their smuggling."
lectianjap.10.a:0 "How scandalous!"

lectianjap.11.t:0 "Offering A Deal"
lectianjap.11.d:0 "In some dirty backroom somewhere in one of Shanghai's many backstreets representatives from the China Agency have met with representatives from the Legations Council. The China Agency are aware we're onto them and now it is time for us to press down the boot. We can obviously look the other way to their indiscretions on the condition that they..."
lectianjap.11.a:0 "...grant us some future favours."
lectianjap.11.b:0 "...give us everything they have on Du Yuesheng."

lectianjap.12.t:0 "Beginning The Crackdown"
lectianjap.12.d:0 "With full knowledge of the indiscretions of the China Agency it is time to put the boot down and remind the Japanese that the Legations are not mere pawns in their game for China. Haung Jinrong is the obvious choice to lead the crackdown but his criminal connections could compromise the status of the council. While the Chamber of Commerce has put itself forward as a more 'moral' alternative, many commissioners doubt their capabilities."
lectianjap.12.a:0 "Time to end this once and for all"

lectianjap.13.t:0 "The Crackdown Succeeds!"
lectianjap.13.d:0 "Good news has for once reached Shanghai and it seems that our crackdown against the China Agency and its puppet organizations has seen success. While the Japanese are incensed there is little they can do and it appears that the China Agency will no longer be a thorn in our side."
lectianjap.13.a:0 "Stability returns to Shanghai!"

lectianjap.14.t:0 "The Crackdown Fails!"
lectianjap.14.d:0 "It seems that our crackdown against the China Agency and its puppet organizations has not gone according to plan. A combination of corruption and proactive attempts to hide their deeds on behalf the Japanese has meant that our attempts to strike down on the Japanese has failed, making a mockery of the Council and allowing the Japanese to paint themselves as victims of a witch-hunt."
lectianjap.14.a:0 "Well that's not good..."

lectianjap.15.t:0 "Help From The Green Gang"
lectianjap.15.d:0 "While it is unfortunate we have to ask for help from common gangsters, with the Japanese proving unwilling to cooperate, we have had to turn to less than orthodox means. By offering to turn a few blind eyes, The Green Gang has agreed to do some investigation work for us and has come to the conclusion that the Japanese are using the China Agency to funnel arms to their contacts in the Chinese interior with the Legation Cities as the smuggling point. While this evidence is flimsy at best we could use it as a prerogative for a more...official investigation."
lectianjap.15.a:0 "This could prove very interesting..."

lectianjap.16.t:0 "The Crackdown Succeeds!"
lectianjap.16.d:0 "Good news has reached Shanghai! The crackdown against the China Agency has went exceptionally well despite the best attempts by the Japanese to obstruct us. With the China Agency defanged and its operations limited solely to its more legal avenues we have removed one of the larger thorns in our side. While the Japanese are internally seething, there is little they can do now."
lectianjap.16.a:0 "Great news!"

lectianjap.17.t:0 "The Crackdown Fails!"
lectianjap.17.d:0 "Terrible news has reached Shanghai! The crackdown against the China Agency has gone horribly wrong! The organization was able to successfully hide in the deep underbellies of the city and obscure it's more illegal operations. While this will have little short-term effect, in the long term Japan will be able to regroup and bolster their operations."
lectianjap.17.a:0 "Damn."

lectianjap.18.t:0 "Shanghai Says Yes!"
lectianjap.18.d:0 "Great news from Shanghai, the Mandate has agreed to give us a green light to further operations in Tianjin. It seems that their economic woes were just too much to maintain security in the city. Regardless, this greatly benefits ourselves and we can now beginning garrisoning more troops in Tianjin, making way for an eventual takeover."
lectianjap.18.a:0 "The dominoes are starting to fall..."

lectianjap.19.t:0 "Japanese Troops Garrison Tianjin"
lectianjap.19.d:0 "It seems that economic woes have gone down hard on the Legation Cities and they have decided to outsource much of their security operations to the Japanese to keep their economy afloat. While there is little we can do to stop them, there has been uproar in the council over the shifting balance of power and with calls for Japan to not abuse their position in the city."
lectianjap.19.a:0 "Worrying, to say the least."

lectianjap.20.t:0 "Shanghai Refuses!"
lectianjap.20.d:0 "Terrible news has come out of Shanghai, the Mandate has refused to give us a green light to further operations! This is a major blow to our plans to takeover Tianjin and we will now have to wait for the China Agency to orchestrate more attacks before we can make our demands again."
lectianjap.20.a:0 "Damn!"

lectianjap.21.t:0 "Terrorist Attack In Tianjin!"
lectianjap.21.d:0 "Earlier today an explosive device was detonated in the port city of Tianjin, killing scores of civilians and wounding many more. The police have claimed that this is simply a case of the anti-concessionist violence though the native Chinese are adamant that 'dark forces' are at work, with some wondering if this has any relation to our recent involvment of Tianjin. Obviously the military has claimed it has nothing to do with them."
lectianjap.21.a:0 "Nothing to do with us!"

lectianjap.22.t:0 "Japan Demands A Security Garrison"
lectianjap.22.d:0 "Members of the Japanese delegation have petitioned the mandate to grant Japan a green light to begin security operations in Tianjin. Arguing that the Tianjin Police have been unable to stem the tide of attacks they now believe that only their own troops can guarantee the safety of their citizens."
lectianjap.22.a:0 "They do raise a good point..."
lectianjap.22.b:0 "What do they think we are, the Japanese Cities?"

lectianjap.23.t:0 "Huang Jinrong Returns"
lectianjap.23.d:0 "Huang Jinrong has come to us with glorious news having caught the bomber - one of the usual miscreant native Chinese though under interrogation he admitted that he himself was not the mastermind behind the plot but instead a rogue Japanese officer. While the Japanese have court-martialed the officer and are attempting to distance themselves from the plot, this serves as a politically embarrassing incident."
lectianjap.23.a:0 "Hurray!"

lectianjap.24.t:0 "The Germans Return"
lectianjap.24.d:0 "The German investigation returned with little luck, having apprehended only a few of the typical miscreants, none of which had shown any initiative or intelligence to construct the bomb and plan out such an attack. After successive interrogations the men were released and we find ourselves with no leads or clues. The Germans have admitted that their 'sources' have failed and promise they'll catch them next time."
lectianjap.24.a:0 "Damn!"

lectianjap.25.t:0 "Invade Tianjin?"
lectianjap.25.d:0 "The Legation Cities are vulnerable, and our forces ready. The IJN is on its way to Tianjin now, where our men there are preparing to seize the city. The Legation Council can do little to stop us, but is it worth the risk of international isolation?"
lectianjap.25.a:0 "Dispatch our troops!"
lectianjap.25.b:0 "I've changed my mind, call back our transports!"

lectianjap.26.t:0 "The Japanese Invasion of Tianjin"
lectianjap.26.d:0 "The Japanese have invaded Tianjin with the full power of the IJN supporting their troops already in their concessions there. They claim to be merely helping us secure the city from unidentified bandits, but this move is clearly very aggressive and beyond the normal parameters of Japanese movements in the Mandate."
lectianjap.26.a:0 "We cannot hope to resist them!"
lectianjap.26.b:0 "But resist we must."

lectianjap.27.t:0 "Tianjin Successfully Captured"
lectianjap.27.d.peace:0 "Tianjin is in our hands! Our troops easily sailed into the second city of the Mandate, and are occupying it even now."
lectianjap.27.d.war:0 "Surprisingly, the Legation Cities have responded to our invasion with incredible hostility, and though we have occupied Tianjin, we are now in a state of war with them."
lectianjap.27.a:0 "All according to plan."

lectianjap.28.t:0 "The Administration of Tianjin"
lectianjap.28.d:0 "Though, of course, we have admitted the Mandate still is sovereign in Tianjin, we can do, in effect, whatever we want with it. Some, in order to expedite the war with the Central Government by our Fengtian allies, propose handing it over to them, while others wish to keep it for ourselves."
lectianjap.28.a:0 "We will retain it for now."
lectianjap.28.b:0 "Hand it over to the rightful Chinese government."

lectianjap.29.t:0 "Japan Hands Over Tianjin to Us"
lectianjap.29.d:0 "The Japanese have recently occupied Tianjin, and have been deliberating the fate of the city. Happily for us, they have decided to restore the city’s administration to the rightful Chinese government, and our troops have already moved into the city. This is a great day for all Chinese!"
lectianjap.29.a:0 "One step closer to reunifying China!"

lectianjap.30.t:0 "The Occupation of Tianjin"
lectianjap.30.d:0 "With pro-Japanese forces having gained control of the Legation Council, they are now beginning to exert their influence. The Legation Council has not only recognized us, they have invited our troops into Tianjin to "secure the city" from the threat of the hostile illegitimate Chinese government. Though our troops can now enter the city and we effectively administer much of the city, most of the profits Tianjin generates still go to Shanghai."
lectianjap.30.a:0 "Still, an enormous coup!"
lectianjap.30.b:0 "In that case, it's not worth it."

lectianjap.31.t:0 "[FNG.GetNameDef] Occupies Tianjin"
lectianjap.31.d:0 "The Fengtian government, with the assistance of the Japanese and the Legation Council, has occupied Tianjin, opening another flanking front for their troops in the coming war. This has energized our people even further to expel the imperial collaborators from our land, but there is little we can do, for now. "
lectianjap.31.a:0 "Awful!"

lectianjap.32.t:0 "Weapons Stockpiles in the Legation Cities"
lectianjap.32.d:0 "Some of our friends in Shanghai have suggested a cunning plan to enrich all and aid our coming war in China - we will provide our agents in the Cities with weapons, and when we are fighting our war they shall smuggle them back to our forces. This will greatly aid our supply lines."
lectianjap.32.a:0 "Sounds like a plan."

lectianjap.33.t:0 "The Legation Cities Supply Our Troops"
lectianjap.33.d:0 "The pro-Japanese but ostensibly neutral Legation Cities have been secretly charged by our Japanese allies to deliver our ground troops with weapons smuggled across the neutral zones, and they have done just that."
lectianjap.33.a:0 "Good news."

lectianjap.34.t:0 "Fengtian Accepts"
lectianjap.34.d:0 "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] has accepted our offer of free passage through Tianjin, meaning they have also accepted our demand of continuing to receive the profits of Mandate-owned industries and Mandatory protective tariffs from nations not on the Council."
lectianjap.34.a:0 "Cooperation is good for everybody."

lectianjap.35.t:0 "Fengtian Refuses"
lectianjap.35.d:0 "[FNG.GetNameDefCap] has refused our offer of free passage through Tianjin, as they are unwilling to accept our terms for retaining many of the profits that the city provides. Tianjin will remain part of the decaying Mandate for now."
lectianjap.35.a:0 "We can serve the Empire better than they can, anyway."

lectianjap.36.t:0 "[FNG.GetNameDefCap]'s Coup in Tianjin"
lectianjap.36.d:0 "After almost two years of occupation, it seems the [FNG.GetAdjective] government no longer feels obliged to stay constant to the terms of our agreement. They have cancelled any shipments to Shanghai, and have put very competitive tariffs on goods coming into Tianjin."
lectianjap.36.a:0 "How annoying."

lectianjap.37.t:0 "Guns Smuggled Into Shanghai"
lectianjap.37.d:0 "Japanese arisakas have found their way into Shanghai and are already being distributed to pro-Japanese collaborators within the Mandate and in areas of China far beyond. Of course there's nothing to see here..."
lectianjap.37.a:0 "Guns come and go every day. We musn't follow every one of them."

lecfuzhou.1.t:0 "Triad Activity in Fuzhou"
lecfuzhou.1.d:0 "One of the pre-eminent members of the Green Gang, Zhang Xiaolin, has begun opening store fronts and suppressing local crime in Fuzhou. This is one of the first times Xiaolin has attempted an independent operation in a different city from Shanghai, and this operation could reveal his style of conducting a gang. What will he order his men to do?"
lecfuzhou.1.a:0 "Xiaolin's men are deadly."
lecfuzhou.1.b:0 "Xiaolin's men expand the Triad organization."
lecfuzhou.1.c:0 "Xiaolin likes profit, however he can find it."

lecfuzhou.2.t:0 "A Fight on the Docks"
lecfuzhou.2.d:0 "In the Fuzhou port gang violence between Xiaolin's men and a local gang looking to curb Xiaolin's encroaching influence has broken out during a smuggling operation of the Green Gang. Xiaolin's men, intercepted by the rival gang, opened fire almost immediately, killing several and wounding many more. While they are a step closer to securing the dockyards of Fuzhou, their reputation has suffered."
lecfuzhou.2.a:0 "More violence, great."

lecfuzhou.3.t:0 "Heroin Production Goes Local"
lecfuzhou.3.d:0 "Zhang Xiaolin, an important member of the Green Gang, has created a domestic Fuzhouan heroin production, making it unnecessary for him to smuggle the heroin from Shanghai, thus making his operations far more secure than they are currently."
lecfuzhou.3.a:0 "We should crack down on the imports from Shanghai."
lecfuzhou.3.b:0 "We should focus on stopping local refinement."

lecfuzhou.4.t:0 "A New Temple Opens in the Town"
lecfuzhou.4.d:0 "Zhang Xiaolin, an important member of the Green Gang, has gracefully sponsored a new temple in Fuzhou, however reports have surfaced that this temple is used more for smuggling drugs than religious worship."
lecfuzhou.4.a:0 "What a waste of real estate."

lecfuzhou.5.t:0 "Green Gang Secures Control of Shipping"
lecfuzhou.5.d:0 "The Green Gang has taken over much of the shipping in Fuzhou, especially of the smuggling of drugs, with them finally being able to push out more smaller local Triads. These had been a thorn in the side of Xiaolin's Green Gang, as they attacked or intercepted smuggling of drugs before."
lecfuzhou.5.a:0 "They better leave legal shipping alone!"

lecfuzhou.6.t:0 "Drugs Proliferating"
lecfuzhou.6.d:0 "Drugs have become more and more common in Fuzhou, with the police being unable to stop the spread of them, with the most popular drugs being opium and heroin. Many of the new drugs are being produced in Fuzhou, though Shanghai remains the hotbed of drug creation."
lecfuzhou.6.a:0 "Where are the police when you need them?"

lecfuzhou.7.t:0 "Zhang Xiaolin's New Powerbase"
lecfuzhou.7.d:0 "Zhang Xiaolin has established Fuzhou as his new power base for his smuggling operations, giving him and the Green Gang a sizeable advantage over other, more local, Triads. He is using his new power base already to expand his smuggling operation elsewhere within China. Many within the government ask how we should respond to this new development, as he may be an useful ally, though some say his new rival and former partner Du Yuesheng could be a more valuable one. Some propose that the best course of action is simply to try and eradicate his gang from Fuzhou, now that he has proved himself a disturber of the peace."
lecfuzhou.7.a:0 "Go to Du Yuesheng."
lecfuzhou.7.b:0 "Try to root him out."
lecfuzhou.7.c:0 "Work with Xiaolin."

lechotung.1.t:0 "Strange Things At The Vermillion Society"
lechotung.1.d:0 "The Vermillion Society is a collection of various clubs, informal groupings, secret societies and organizations made up of wealthy and influential men in the Mandate, often from Chinese or mixed-race backgrounds. The Society's nationalist leaning is an open secret and their funding of nationalist organizations througout China is somewhat in the open, though it has never been confirmed to be true. The Society provides somewhat of a headache to the council and represents in the broadest terms Chinese influence in the Legations. Recently, tax agents have discovered numerous irregularities in the funding of the Society with the trail leading to Hong Kong. While there is no evidence as to whether or not this is simple tax evasion or a much grander conspiracy, we should investigate and see where the clues take us."
lechotung.1.a:0 "This could prove interesting..."

lechotung.2.t:0 "The Hotung Connection"
lechotung.2.d:0 "Our investigations have borne fruit and the paper trail leads back to none other than Sir Robert Hotung of Hong Kong. Hotung is one of Hong Kong's more influential businessman and is widely respected in the city and the Legations at large. One of the richest men in Hong Kong, Hotung controls much of the city's largest enterprises and was able to expand his influence when the British were partially evicted. Hotung is a notable Chinese nationalist and was involved in the founding of the Vermillion Society when his Hong Kong based Chinese Club merged with similar groups, with Hotung still acting as the de facto chairman of the Hong Kong branch and is by far its most notable figure. Despite his leanings Hotung is ironically one of the larger supporters of the Legations among the Chinese crowd, seeing no contradiction in his support for both Chinese nationalism and the perceived safety of the cities. Despite all this it seems the old man is despairing at the situation of China and has began desperately funding nationalist organizations across the spectrum including the fledgling KMT, the Fengtian Government and Chen Jiongming's Federalists. While funding these organizations is not illegal, tax evasion is and it gives us an opportunity to crack the monetary lifelines of some of the Legations greatest existential threats."
lechotung.2.a:0 "Sir Robert would surely understand."

lechotung.3.t:0 "Questions Need To Be Asked"
lechotung.3.d:0 "The initial investigation into the KMT connection regarding Sir Robert has not gone particularly brilliant. The investigation team has been unable to locate any KMT members beyond the usual low-ranking miscreants, all of whom are unaware to the greater workings of the Kuomintang machine. To make matters worse the KMT appear to be onto us and have since retreated to the shadows. If this investigation is to go any further we'll need to call in some help. The China Agency are efficient though they may meet the same end as ourselves. Du Yuesheng is a known KMT sympathiser and could very easily lead us to the KMT cells in exchange for a favour or two..."
lechotung.3.a:0 "Best of a bad bunch, I suppose."

lechotung.4.t:0 "The Japanese Are On The Case!"
lechotung.4.d:0 "After some drawn out negotiations, we have finally come to an amicable agreement with the Japanese. In exchange for offshoring the investigation to their China Agency, we'll look the other way on some of their more...illicit operations. While not exactly ethical, it is does allow us to get to the bottom of this mystery."
lechotung.4.a:0 "All for the greater good."

lechotung.5.t:0 "The KMT Cell In Shanghai"
lechotung.5.d:0 "The Japanese have come to us with some interesting results and have exposed a KMT cell operating in Shanghai itself. While this was always suspected, to finally have a confirmation as well as an insight into their operations. While much of the cell was able to escape and regroup, we are slowly closing in and have thrown a spanner into the works of the KMT's XinTeFa operations branch."
lechotung.5.a:0 "Brilliant news!"

lechotung.6.t:0 "Du Yuesheng's Collaboration"
lechotung.6.d:0 "While it has always been an open secret that Du Yuesheng has sympathies for the KMT, with help from our allies in the China Agency, we have finally been able to prove his illegal involvement with the group, primarily in supplying weapons and counterfeited documents. This proves as both a blow to the KMT and primarily to Du's operations."
lechotung.6.a:0 "The noose is closing in..."

lechotung.7.t:0 "Cracked The KMT!"
lechotung.7.d:0 "Great news! It seems our allies have held up and we have successfully taken the fight to the KMT managing the break their monetary lifeline. In the short-term this will not effect the wider Kuomintang but it does break their operations in the cities and has proven a heavy blow to the Vermillion Society."
lechotung.7.a:0 "Hurray!"

lechotung.8.t:0 "A Dead End"
lechotung.8.d:0 "It seems the China Agency was not as resourceful as we had expected. During an operation in Shanghai, KMT XinTeFa agents were able to escape with important documents, destroying what had been left behind. While this serves as a boost to th Vermillion Society and to the Kuomintang, it at least damages the Japanese with heads beginning to role in Tokyo."
lechotung.8.a:0 "Drat!"

lechotung.9.t:0 "Into The Dragon's Den"
lechotung.9.d:0 "Du Yuesheng is a known sympathiser of the rightist Kuomintang though with a special distaste for Wang Jingwei and his more socialist elements. Even better, he is a common criminal and not averse to doing dirty work for the right price... Du could easily help us sabotage the KMT connection but in exchange he will expect far more than a mere pound of flesh and has requested that we arrange an 'accident' at the Shanghai Police Archives."
lechotung.9.a:0 "Well if we have no choice..."

lechotung.10.t:0 "Fire At The Shanghai Police Station!"
lechotung.10.d:0 "Horrible news has come in from Shanghai! A massive fire has broken out in the police archives with numerous case files being destroyed in the inferno. The fire brigade have desperately battled to save what they could but it ultimately resulted in the loss of the entire D section. Valuable files on Du Yuesheng have been lost to history, setting back our investigation into his affairs."
lechotung.10.a:0 "Was it truly an accident?"

lechotung.11.t:0 "A Book Of Names"
lechotung.11.d:0 "It seems that the fire has had a silver lining. As the fire investigation team searched the rubble, a small black book was discovered and contained the names of Kuomintang agents, safehouses, weapons caches, dates of meetings and supply lines. With such a treasure chest of information the Kuomintang will melt in the face of the police."
lechotung.11.a:0 "What a find!"

lechotung.12.t:0 "Investigating The Fengtian Lead"
lechotung.12.d:0 "Interestingly it seems some of Hotung's money is being deposited in the accounts of high-ranking members of the Fengtian governments and various companies involved with the Fengtian administration. Being the last stand of the Xinhai Order seems to have paid off for Zhang Zuolin with Hotung donating much of his money to the remaining republican government. We must tread carefully during this operation as the Japanese are unlikely to be thrilled to find us meddling in the affairs of their puppet."
lechotung.12.a:0 "Let's reach out to friends in the West..."

lechotung.13.t:0 "A Meeting With The Westerners"
lechotung.13.d:0 "In one of the more opulent gentleman's clubs in Shanghai, a meeting between representatives from AnCham Shanghai, the Ostchina Direktorium, the Hong Club and the Shanghai Municipal Council was under way to discuss their mutual issue of Hotung giving money to Fengtian. After lots of bickering the group eventually agreed to put together a joint investigation team to get to the bottom of what's going on. Though due to the high-profile nature of the meeting it won't be long before the Japanese catch on..."
lechotung.13.a:0 "Did that window open itself?"

lechotung.14.t:0 "A Report From Shanghai"
lechotung.14.d:0 "Our operatives in the China Agency have informed us that a covert meeting between the western powers and the SMC has taken place to discuss the issue of Fengtian receiving Vermillion Society donations and this is surprising news to the foreign office. Much of the civilian government wishes to ignore the meeting and let the Legations deal with this themselves so they can unwittingly push Fengtian further into our grip though some members of the military have called on us to veto the investigation immediately."
lechotung.14.a:0 "Well Fengtian is independent after all..."
lechotung.14.b:0 "Veto the investigation! Only we are responsible for Fengtian's affairs."

lechotung.15.t:0 "Something's Wrong"
lechotung.15.d:0 "Despite fears that the Japanese had been spying on the meeting and would be ready to veto the investigation it appears that they themselves are unaware of Fengtian's monetary aid and will let us operate unhindered. Despite this it seems that they have unwittingly informed Fengtian by demanding answers. Early today a group of armed Chinese men broke into the investigator's offices and began firing automatic weapons before setting fire to the room and escaping. No evidence was discovered but the Fengtian Government is suspected of the attack."
lechotung.15.a:0 "Damn it!"

lechotung.16.t:0 "Dead End!"
lechotung.16.d:0 "Be it by the Japanes vetoing our investigation or an attack by dark forces, our investigation into Fengtian's funding is over with no real result. While we have certainly done some minor damage it won't hinder Fengtian in the long-term."
lechotung.16.a:0 "Put it in the cold cases."

lechotung.17.t:0 "Interesting Leads"
lechotung.17.d:0 "It seems that by investigating the Cantonese connection has paid off greatly with the numerous interesting leads being discovered by the investigation team. It seems that Sir Robert is heavily involved in the activities of Chen Jiongming and Li Zongren of the essentially defunct Rightist KMT. To continue our investigation we will have to dig deeper into the Canton connection by either going to the heart of operations in Hong Kong or by strongarming the Ostchina Direktorium to grant us some favours within the AOG."
lechotung.17.a:0 "Into the heart of darkness we go."

lechotung.18.t:0 "A Dinner At The Hong Kong Club"
lechotung.18.d:0 "Despite the British ostensibly being evicted from the Legations, they continue to hold huge sway in their old colony of Hong Kong, primarily through the Hong Kong Club. During our investigation into Chen Jiongming's affairs in Canton, the Club has shown an interest in aiding us and appear to have been conducting an investigation of their own into him. A few bribes over a friendly dinner and this information could fall into our hands..."
lechotung.18.a:0 "I think I'll have my steak well done."

lechotung.19.t:0 "A Favour From The AOG"
lechotung.19.d:0 "The AOG or Aufsichtsrat der Ostasiatischen Generalverwaltung are a grouping of semi-legal territorial concessions throughout China, afforded to Germany by warlord Sun Chuanfang and they often been referred to as Germany's own Legation Cities. One of their primary base of operations is in the southern port city of Guangzhou near Hong Kong. It is no secret the Germans have been keeping tabs on the activities of Chen and other revolutionaries in the city. In exchange for some clout to the Ostchina Direktorium, the AOG will gladly take part in some information sharing."
lechotung.19.a:0 "Pleasure doing business with you!"

lechotung.20.t:0 "The Commission For Laundering"
lechotung.20.d:0 "It seems that our connections have paid off and we have struck a monumental blow to the Vermillion Society as one of their biggest allies has been cut off from funding. While in the short term this won't have much impact on Chen, it has already wreaked havoc on the Vermillion Society. A direct product of the investigation is the creation of the Commission for Laundering which will oversee and fight money laundering attempts in the cities, curtailing future Vermillion Society intrigue."
lechotung.20.a:0 "You fought the law and the law won."

lechotung.21.t:0 "Chen Jiongming Arrives In Hong Kong"
lechotung.21.d:0 "Chen Jiongming, leader of the Chinese Federalist movement has arrived in Hong Kong, having been forced to go into exile recently from his native Guangdong. He has already become a guest speaker and close associate of the Vermillion Society and is currently staying with Sir Robert Hotung until he can find a more permanent accommodation. While his presence proves a minor headache for the Hong Kong Club, for the most he doesn't appear capable of causing any major revolts for the time being."
lechotung.21.a:0 "What an interesting fellow."

lechotung.22.t:0 "Chen Jiongming Dies"
lechotung.22.d:0 "News has arrived today that Chen Jiongming, the Chinese Federalist leader has died from typhus. Having suffered from ill health since his move to Hong Kong, it seems Chen finally succumbed to his diseases and passed on. As the Vermillion Society mourn, the Federalist movement has effectively collapsed without Chen."
lechotung.22.a:0 "Rest in peace."

legcities.45.t:0 "The Triads Seize Power"
legcities.45.d:0 "After consulting with his soothsayer, Big Ears Du ordered an orgy of violence against Legation officials culminating in the full seizure of power by the Sun Yee On and Green Gang coalition. With their power structures merged as one they have formed a united council of Dragon Heads formalising their rule over the cities. While international powers are concerned the promise of continuing trade and increased tariffs have stayed their hand for now."
legcities.45.a:0 "Long live our Hung Brothers"

legcities.46.t:0 "Lord Josslyn Erroll takes his chance"
legcities.46.d:0 "With the situation in Shanghai crumbling by the second a crisis meeting was called of the Legation Mandate Council to decide on what course of action to take. Lord Josslyn Errolll proposed that the Mandate itself be suspended and all legislative powers be formally invested in one Commissioner until the situation improves. A vote was called and Erroll won by a large margin. Josslyn stated in a telegram to the Mandatory Powers that full tariffs and taxes will resume and requesting their ratification of the appointment. None objected."
legcities.46.a:0 "Surely he will relinquish them afterwards"

legcities.47.t:0 "Jiang Qing crosses the Hung Gate"
legcities.47.d:0 "After the collapse of the United Dragon Head Council, Jiang Qing has emerged as the preferred leader by decision of the Incense Master, Red Pole and White Sandal. Her policy of mass Opium sales rang true as the best venture to focus on."
legcities.47.a:0 "A New Dragon Rises."

legcities.48.t:0 "Huang Jinrong crosses the Hung Gate"
legcities.48.d:0 "After the collapse of the United Dragon Head Council, Huang Jinrong has emerged as the preferred leader by unanimous decision of the ranking Triad members. His policy of mass smuggling, prostitution and counterfeiting is seen as the safest option for now."
legcities.48.a:0 "We salute you Hung Brother!"

legcities.49.t:0 "Du Yuensheng crosses the Hung Gate"
legcities.49.d:0 "The United Dragon Head council has collapsed and from it's wreckage strives Big Ears Du, his policy of brutality, murder and enforcement proved too lucrative to resist to the remaining council members and they elected him without question."
legcities.49.a:0 "The Fortunes pre-ordained this day!"

legcities.58.t:0 "The Great Charlie Chaplin visits Shanghai!"
legcities.58.d:0 "The great Charlie Chaplin has decided to visit Shanghai! While in more recent times his films have been labelled as provocative or censored for being "Syndicalist propaganda" there are no such problems here. Chaplin took a tour of some our own opera houses and then attended a showing of "Modern Times" subtitled for the native audience."
legcities.58.a:0 "We hope he comes again!"

legcities.59.t:0 "Reaction of the Legation Powers"
legcities.59.d:0 "With the Legation Mandate Council eliminated as an effective power player in the Cities, the payment of dividends to the Legation Powers has ceased, as well. There is a distinct possibility that some of them may take a dim view of this loss and take forceful action."
legcities.59.a:0 "Surely they know better."

legcities.60.t:0 "Blood on the Streets of Shanghai"
legcities.60.d:0 "The authority of the Legation Mandate Council has collapsed in a single night of blood and violence. Street gangs organised by the Chinese criminal organisations have slaughtered many members of the police corps, administrators and even a handful of the more influential delegates from the Legation Powers. The survivors hardly dare to leave their homes. Needless to say, with the Triads in all but complete control of all commercial activities, the payment of dividends from the Cities has ceased."
legcities.60.no_proff:0 "The authority of the Legation Mandate Council has collapsed in a single night of blood and violence. Street gangs organised by the Chinese criminal organisations have slaughtered many members of the police corps, administrators and even a handful of the more influential delegates from the Legation Powers. Fortunately, since the dividends we are entitled to have not been payed anyway, this has little effect on us."
legcities.60.a:0 "That's too bad."
legcities.60.b:0 "This cannot be allowed to stand!"

legcities.61.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] prepares for intervention"

Should the Council be unwilling or unable to do so, [From.GetNameDef] is fully prepared to used force of arms to ensure compliance. With the Council members either dead or effectively confined to their residences, it seems intervention is inevitable."
legcities.61.a:0 "Have we gone too far?"

legcities.62.t:0 "Legation Council condemns Violence"
legcities.62.d:0 "The powers represented on the Legation Council have passed a resolution condemning the recent outbreak of violence in the Cities. They have reaffirmed their support for the authorities in the Cities in their struggle to restore order. It seems the powers are not ready for efforts rising above such symbolic measures."
legcities.62.a:0 "Our power is secure."

legcities.63.t:0 "Our Flag"
legcities.63.d:0 "What should the flag of the Legation Mandate be? We have two options, to continue using the current flag of our mandate, or to adopt a brand-new design. Which shall we pick to be our new flag?"
legcities.63.a:0 "Continue using the current flag."
legcities.63.b:0 "Adopt a new design."

legcities.100.t:0 "The Dragon on the Mountain Seizes the Mandate of Heaven"
legcities.100.d:0 "Long have the Three Harmonies Society, or the Triads, influenced China from the shadows. With roots in the secretive Tiandihui and the White Lotus, we have pulled the strings of China’s political game for centuries. We helped plant the seeds of discontent that gave rise to the Taiping Rebellion and the Boxer Uprising. We have spread the opium and gun trades far and wide across East Asia. Our agents have helped topple dynasties while our Red Poles, 49ers, and Blue Lanterns have infiltrated and profited from nearly every operation in China, monetarily or otherwise. \n\nThe time for this secretive control is finally over however, for the Three Harmonies Society no longer needs to hide in shadows. Our stalwart Mountain Master, the Dragon Head [LEC.getleader] has led the Triads and the Chinese people to their true destiny. No longer shall petty warlords, false monarchs, and greedy imperialists prey upon or squander this land under heaven. In the honor of Guan Yu, we have claimed the Mandate of Heaven. May all of China bow to the true Dragon of China."
legcities.100.a:0 "Three Harmonies, forever in balance."

legcities.101.t:0 "The Return of the Great Ming"
legcities.101.d:0 "With the Three Harmonies Society’s ascendance to rule over all of China, a new idea has begun to quickly take hold within our ranks and citizenry. The Qing have been disgraced, and the cowardly traitor Puyi deposed and cast aside, but the idea of monarchism in China is not entirely dead, for the final heir to the Ming Dynasty still breathes! \n\nHiding out in a small village south of Changchun, the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun has been living in exile, banished by the German-backed Qing government years ago and stripped of his titles. However, Dragon Head [LEC.getleader] rules over the Chinese people now, not the cowardly whelp Puyi. We could invite this royal-blooded noble into our administration, granting him his ‘rightful’ seat on the Dragon Throne. He would take the ancient title of ‘Duguid Hou’ and serve as a unifying figure for our harmonious criminal society, being coronated in a ceremonial fusion of Triad and traditional Chinese rituals. Alternatively, we could quietly cover up any and all traces of knowledge of his whereabouts, and simply write off this archaic imperial into the dusty pages of history."
legcities.101.a:0 "The Dragon Head needs no false monarch or disgraced dynasty!"
legcities.101.b:0 "All hail the Marquis of Zhu; the one, true Dragon Emperor of China!"

### Ideas ###

NFL_debt:0 "Crippling Debt"
NFL_debt_desc:0 "Our decisions to build a railway from St. John’s to Port aux Basques and massive military spending during the Great War has incurred surprising amounts of debt for us with dismal interest rates. Our main Creditors are Canada and National France, with another other minor creditor being Australia. Paying back our debts will require a massive amount of time for a nation of our size."

NFL_legacy_of_1932:0 "Memories of 1932"
NFL_legacy_of_1932_desc:0 "The Riot which came about as a result of the Squires’ Government’s corruption almost ended Newfoundlander Democracy as we know it. The ensuing political crisis led to the decimation of the Liberals and Fredrick Alderice’s United Newfoundland Party gaining power. While Responsible Government has thus far held on by a thread, it is clear that most Newfoundlanders, including those Governing the Dominion, have grown disillusioned with Democracy. Frustration with Democracy in the wake of the Great Depression has reached a high, and some wonder that another crisis may just push our nation over the edge."

NFL_corruption:0 "All-Encompassing Corruption"
NFL_corruption_desc:0 ""

NFL_bad_economy:0 "Terrible Economy"
NFL_bad_economy_desc:0 "Attributed to our unfortunate economic reliance on the fish, paper, and mineral exports, and our lack of any industrial or population centers, Newfoundland has been forced into extreme economic hardship. Our economic situation was only worsened by the American Great Depression, and while while the Depression wreaked havoc on our and Canada's economy, it did not fully cripple our nation's economy. With any hope our nation will recover, slowly."

NFL_great_depression:0 "Obliterated Economy"
NFL_great_depression_desc:0 "The Great Depression was a hurdle we could have overcome, however just when we seemed to be on the path to recovery,  the crippling Black Monday depression has completely eviscerated what remains of our fragile economy. The few markets we have access to no longer want to purchase our products, and our creditors don't have enough funds to sustain our economy. We have few assets at our disposal, and if we wish to dig ourselves out of this hole we must work hard. "

NFL_recovering_economy:0 "Recovering Economy"
NFL_recovering_economy_desc:0 "Through hard work we have managed to crawl out our economic hole. Although most of our nation is still a backwater, the extensive investments we have made in our industries have greatly assisted in our nation’s economic progress. While the prospects of full recovery seem grim, significant leeway has been made in our recovery efforts."

NFL_reliance_on_canada:0 "Reliance on Canada"
NFL_reliance_on_canada_desc:0 "Newfoundland has little in terms of domestic resources, leaving us completely reliant on our larger neighbor, the Dominion/Kingdom of Canada. Newfoundland for better or for worse is unbreakably bonded to our elder sibling within the Empire."

NFL_memories_of_the_regiment:0 "Legacy of the Newfoundland Regiment"
NFL_memories_of_the_regiment_desc:0 "Our own Royal Newfoundland Regiment has a storied tradition of bad luck. First suffering cataclysmic losses at Gallipoli, and then losing 90 percent of the regiment during the first Battle of the Somme. Our poor performance in the Weltkreig has been a source of shame for our army, who sees the need to prepare properly for a conflict as paramount. "

NFL_plot_begins_desc:0 "While many have graciously allowed the Canadians to trample on our sovereignty without fuss, a certain number of workers, ever tired of the tyranny of the bosses, have reached their breaking point. The workers of Newfoundland have had enough of Newfoundland’s Merchant Master Class and their Canadian enablers; and while dislodging them may take a constrained effort, we are ready for whatever tribulations breaking our chains may entail."
NFL_mobilize_opposition_against_the_commission:0 "Mobilize Opposition Against the Commission"
NFL_mobilize_opposition_against_the_commission_desc:0 "Before the tyranny of the Commission put an end to any such faint dreams of Democracy, a great man by the name of Richard Squires fought tooth and nail along with Coaker to ensure that our workers would breathe free. Derided by the Merchants and the Newspapers under their sway, Squires’ tenure would not last, uprooted tragically by the great Riot of ‘32. Ever a champion of returning to our democracy lost, Squires has been left with no other options; the Commission is here to stay, and the best chance to return the power of Newfoundland’s fate to its people resides with the Union of Britain. A great irony, considering how much Squires fought against associations with Syndicalists during his time in power.. . "
NFL_recruit_unemployed:0 "Recruit the Unemployed"
NFL_recruit_unemployed_desc:0 "A great many men in St. Johns lie destitute and desperate for any means of income. Seeing this as an opportunity, the Syndicalists have recruited these men as agitators, ever eager to tear down the systems of Oppression the moment the right moment strikes. The decline of the FPU shall be reversed, as we spread our brand of Unionism from the traditional stronghold of the fisheries, into the mines and forests, where loggers and miners toil in unfair conditions ."
NFL_organize_the_unions:0 "Organize the Unions"
NFL_organize_the_unions_desc:0 "The Fishermen's Protective Union has long battled for the inherent rights of every worker. In the process, the FPU has amassed a large amount of sway within the Newfie political scene. While the Commission has cracked down on such ‘Syndicalist’ organizations, the workers of Newfoundland continue to commiserate and meet under the banner of the FPU despite it being officially outlawed. Just like in Britain, a revolution is brewing; and the Unions are set to be first to answer the Clarion Call once the Revolution arrives."
NFL_abandon_nonradicalism:0 "Abandon Non-Radicalism"
NFL_abandon_nonradicalism_desc:0 "So long has the Fishermen's Protective Union been derided as a Syndicalist organization, despite every assurance otherwise. At a certain point fighting accusations of Syndicalism has become fighting against our own interests; now, Syndicalism stands as our only hope to free the working men of Newfoundland from the bosses’ oppression. If the Merchants want to see what a truly Syndicalist workingman's organization looks like, they are about to bear witness to the dawn of true Unionism. "
NFL_sabatoge_recovery_efforts:0 "Sabotage Recovery Efforts"
NFL_sabatoge_recovery_efforts_desc:0 "While most workers see through the veneer for what the Commission truly is, some have been fooled by their lukewarm promises of economic recovery. To prevent our more gullible citizenry from being swayed by the Commission’s Siren Song, we must sabotage the Commission’s efforts to help the economy recover. The workers of Newfoundland shall be made to see that the only solution to their woes is the guiding hand of Syndicalism."
NFL_cooperate_with_cashin:0 "The Cashin-Coaker Alliance"
NFL_cooperate_with_cashin_desc:0 "Peter John Cashin and William Coaker have forged a strange partnership. While typically Coaker would want nothing to do with such a brazen plot against the Empire, the wanton persecution of the FPU by the Commission has driven Coaker to desperate means. Through violent or nonviolent means, Coaker and Cashin are determined to dismantle the Commission and Imperial influence in Newfoundland once and for all."
NFL_anti_canadian_fearmongering:0 "Fearmonger Against the Canadians"
NFL_anti_canadian_fearmongering_desc:0 "The Canadians have never stopped attempting to control Newfoundland, from the Labrador Boundary Disputes of the past, to their unjust usurpation of British Duties. It has become clear that the greatest threat to our sovereignty lies in Ottawa, and if we are to escape from Canadian clutches, we must turn to our oldest friend and protector: Britain. "
NFL_appeal_to_smalwood:0 "Get Smallwood on Our Side"
NFL_appeal_to_smalwood_desc:0 "It has come as a surprise to many that Joey Smallwood, the darling of the Confederationist Movement and one of the strongest supporters of Squires’ Government, was once of Newfoundland’s most fervent red-blooded Socialists. Despite abandoning his Socialist ideals to be more palatable to our nonradical political scene, Smallwood, along with his Newfoundland Federation of Labour, have been driven firmly to the side of Coaker’s plot. It has unfortunately become clear that the Unions of Newfoundland can no longer coexist with the Commission, and for our fair Terra Nova to be free from the bosses, we must turn to radical; even Syndicalist means. "

Alone and far-removed from Europe’s epicenters of Socialism, our hopes for survival against a superior Canadian foe are slim; to even have a fighting chance, we must turn to London for any support that could possibly be given. The Union of Britain will begin supplying our revolution-to-be, allowing us to covertly prepare for our uprising, hopefully without drawing too much suspicion from the Canadians."

newfoundland.1.t:0 "The First Dominion"
newfoundland.1.d:0 "During their social gatherings in Ottawa, the Exiles fondly reminisce about the complex history of the Anglo presence in Canada, particularly in Newfoundland. Their nostalgia for the empire that slipped from their grasp a decade earlier is evident as they reflect on how the foundation of that empire was laid with the acquisition of Newfoundland. Although Jamestown's settlement in Virginia predates Newfoundland's significance, England's earliest settlements in the New World were indeed established within Newfoundland, notably Cuper's Cove. Over the following centuries, the region witnessed a tumultuous history marked by colonial conflicts between native tribes and the French, leading to attempts to eradicate the entire colony. However, in 1825, Newfoundland became a Crown colony under British control, initiating the next chapter in its development. Subsequently, the colony drafted a constitution, appointed its first governor, and achieved self-governing status in 1854, with Philip Francis Little as its inaugural premier. A significant milestone occurred in 1907 when Newfoundland attained Dominion status within the empire, coinciding conveniently with the outbreak of the First Weltkrieg. This change marked an increase in level of autonomy for the island, further shaping its small role in the larger British Empire. The bitter failures of the Great War were felt strongly in Newfoundland, who's own intense contributions were ultimately in vain. The British Revolution further shook Newfoundland, as the Liberal/FUP Government of Richard Squires and William Coaker was smeared by opponents accusing them of following the same thread of Syndicalism present in the Union of Britain. While the Union Presence was strong in Newfoundland, ideas such as Syndicalism failed to spread into the isolated and socially conservative fishing communities that comprised a majority of their base.\n Formally the last part of the British Empire, jurisdiction of Newfoundland was formally transferred to Canada in 1926, an act which infuriated those who were less than trusting to their Canadian neighbors. The 'usurpation' of duties by Canada has been often a point of contention, with many such as Peter John Cashin desiring 'radical' solutions to free Newfoundland from Canadian influence.\n While we have adjusted to Canadian rule in many ways, Newfoundland's fragile economy and political scene have often put our democratic institutions to the test, with the smouldering anti-democratic sentiment bursting into flame after the unsavoury and corrupt practices of the Squires government were revealed to the general public. This incident would almost mean the death of Responsible Government in Newfound; fortunately due to Canadian mediation and a snap election being held, Newfoundlander Democracy was salvaged. For now at least, it appears that the status quo is safe, however any radical change in our already uneasy situation may prove disastrous, and could very well spell the end of the Dominion as we know it... "
newfoundland.1.a:0 "Quaerite prime regnum Dei!"

newfoundland.2.t:0 "Death of King George V"
newfoundland.2.d:0 "Newfoundland awoke this morning to the somber news that King George V had passed away shortly before midnight yesterday. The king had been suffering from ill health for some time and his death was not unexpected, having shirked away from the public some time ago. His death marked the end of an era and the beginning of another one, with his son, Edward VIII, who stands ready to ascend to the throne. The nation was struck by a profound sense of loss as they realized there was no longer a King to lead them. In contrast to the Ottawa government, which is heavily influenced by the Exiles, Newfoundland possesses an intimate connection with the Exiles and London that dates back to before the revolution. Having achieved dominion status in 1907, Newfoundlanders felt a deep bond with the monarchy and the United Kingdom. Even during the tumultuous Weltkrieg, the nation proudly raised its own infantry regiment to fight for the King and defend shared values. As Prince Edward prepares to take the throne, Newfoundlanders reflect on their history, proud of their dominion status. While the Exiles might not have been as strong here, Newfoundlanders cherish their enduring connection to the King in Ottawa, and mourn his passing. With Prince Edward's succession, there is hope that this bond will continue to foster a sense of unity and loyalty to the Crown."
newfoundland.2.a:0 "The king is dead, long live the king!"

newfoundland.3.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Newfoundland!"
newfoundland.3.d:0 "The Berlin Stock Exchange failure has triggered a catastrophic chain of events on unprecedented scale, leading to what is now known as Black Monday. Panic has swept across the globe, prompting investors to withdraw savings from banks and funds from the stock market. While we initially thought we might be shielded from the immediate impact due to our distance from the German sphere, the repercussions of the crash soon reached our shores as the global economy crumbled. Black Monday has dealt a devastating blow to the already struggling economies of Canada and the United States, both still reeling from the effects of their Great Depressions. Newfoundland, already facing financial challenges from the completion of a railroad across the dominion in the 1890s and the costs incurred during the raising of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in the Weltkrieg, has been hit particularly hard. Several of our banks have collapsed, leaving people in financial disarray, unable to access their savings and struggling to afford the necessities of life. Newfoundland's situation is dire, and immediate action must be taken to prevent complete chaos. The impact of the economic downturn is felt throughout our nation, and our citizens face significant hardship. Only through decisive and effective action can we hope to navigate these turbulent times and pave the way towards a brighter future for Newfoundland."
newfoundland.3.a:0 "It can't get any worse than it already is, right...?"

newfoundland.4.t:0 "The Fate of the Government"
newfoundland.4.d:0 "The situation in Newfoundland has reached a critical point, with our coffers depleted, leaving us on the brink of bankruptcy. The state of the economy is dire, and it has become painfully evident that the current government is no longer capable of functioning effectively. In light of these circumstances, there are two potential courses of action to consider: the establishment of a Canadian Commission or seeking annexation by Canada. The pressing financial crisis has rendered our government virtually powerless to address mounting challenges. Implementing a Commission of Government could provide a temporary solution by appointing a group of experts to take control and manage the affairs of the dominion. This is until our financial stability is restored and our economic woes are no more. This option, though it may help us navigate through the immediate crisis, raises concerns about our autonomy and decision-making. On the other hand, seeking annexation from Canada is another option that has been considered. Joining Canada could offer us access to abundant resources, stability, and a stronger economic framework to aid us in our recovery. However, this path also raises questions about our identity as a distinct entity and the potential loss of our own autonomy."
newfoundland.4.a:0 "Suspend Responsible Government!"
newfoundland.4.b:0 "Formally Ask Canada for Annexation!"

newfoundland.5.t:0 "Newfoundland Requests Annexation"
newfoundland.5.d:0 "In a historic and solemn moment, Newfoundland's people and government have requested annexation from Canada. Facing an unprecedented financial crisis that has left our coffers empty and the economy in dire straits, the decision to seek annexation was not taken lightly. With the Canadian Commission unable to provide the necessary solutions to our financial instability, the people of Newfoundland have come to recognize that joining Canada offers a lifeline and a path towards stability and prosperity for their futures. Under Ottawa's guidance, Newfoundland will hopefully grow prosperous under this annexation request."
newfoundland.5.a:0 "We can not afford their burden."
newfoundland.5.b:0 "Absorb Newfoundland into Canada!"

newfoundland.6.t:0 "Canada Refuses Annexation"
newfoundland.6.d:0 "In response to Newfoundland's earnest annexation request, Canada respectfully declined the proposal. While acknowledging Newfoundland's financial challenges, Canada believes that annexation is not the appropriate solution for either party involved. Annexation is a complex and far-reaching issue that demands careful consideration of preexisting issues and concerns. The Ottawa government is currently preoccupied with addressing its own financial woes, and integrating Newfoundland would strain its resources and hinder its recovery efforts. What was originally a series of unfortunate events has become a nightmare. This is as we scramble to prevent its collapse, with our options limited to declaring bankruptcy or suspending the democratic government. The situation is indeed dire, and the future appears grim for Newfoundland."
newfoundland.6.a:0 "We have no choice now - Suspend Responsible Government"

newfoundland.7.t:0 "Death of Prime Minister Alderdice"
newfoundland.7.d:0 "The past year has witnessed sombering event after sombering event as Newfoundland mourns the passing of its esteemed Prime Minister, Frederick C. Alderdice. Under his guidance, Newfoundland made considerable strides in alleviating the existing financial burdens and economic depression caused by Black Monday. His sudden demise has left a void in the political landscape. Newfoundlanders remember his tireless efforts to keep the democratic system intact while grappling with severe economic challenges. In the wake of his passing, while the government remains resolute in its pursuit of financial stability, many feel uneasy as to whether or not Newfoundland has a future ahead at all."
newfoundland.7.a:0 "Don't we have enough problems already?"

newfoundland.8.t:0 "Death of Lord Anderson"
newfoundland.8.d:0 "The year 1936 has brought an unfortunate and somber reality to Newfoundland, as it seems the grim reaper has chosen our beloved island as his holiday destination. Today, we mourn the passing of Governor-General David Murray Anderson, whose noble service to the nation has ended. Having assumed the role of His Majesty's Representative, Governor-General Anderson faced a tumultuous time in the Dominion of Newfoundland. 1936 has been unrelenting, leaving the nation grappling with financial instability and hardship. Governor-General Anderson's dedication to his duties was unparalleled, even in severe sickness. He remained resolute and committed to serving Newfoundland's people during this critical period. His loss is deeply felt by the entire nation, as he leaves behind a legacy of selflessness and devotion to duty."
newfoundland.8.a:0 "Appoint Admiral Walwyn as Governor-General."

newfoundland.9.t:0 "Free Elections to be Held"
newfoundland.9.d:0 "In what appears to be the beginning of the end of our woes, the Ottawa government has taken a significant step by granting the Royal Commission, responsible for overseeing Newfoundland's affairs, the authority to reinstate our autonomy and democracy ahead of schedule. With this positive development, Newfoundland can now steer its own course and take charge of its destiny. The return of our autonomy is a testament to our people's resilience and determination, who have worked tirelessly to overcome financial hardships and economic challenges that once burdened us. It is crucial for us to maintain a stable and prosperous economy to ensure this newfound independence. Any setbacks could lead to the commission's reinstatement."

newfoundland.15.t:0 "The Amulree Report"
newfoundland.15.d:0 "The Newfoundland Royal Commission has released its own findings, drawing parallels with the efforts of the West Indian Royal Commission, headed by Sir Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne. The comprehensive report, known as the Amulree Report, delves into intricate details, explaining how Newfoundland's political culture exacerbated its economic instability. The findings shed light on crucial aspects of Newfoundland's governance and economy. Newfoundland's mercantile elite never fully embraced the democratic government's potential, the report reveals. They regarded the system as expensive, cumbersome, and inefficient, leading them to grant power carelessly to individuals lacking education and experience. This fostered a culture of corruption and patronage, as mercenary politicians vied to secure votes. The political system, unfortunately, is built on widespread corruption, undermining responsible government. Moreover, the Amulree Report exposes deep sectarian rivalries within the country's government, which adds to the government's challenges. As the financial crises deepened in the 1930s, certain merchants and their allies grew increasingly anxious about their own finances. Fearing bankruptcy and debt defaults, they entertained the idea of suspending the constitution and entrusting the country's affairs to a "commission" to safeguard their wealth. For them, sacrificing a responsible government seemed like a small price to pay for financial stability. Regrettably, many Newfoundlanders sympathized with this sentiment, due to government and corruption scandals in the 1920s. Administrations were short-lived, plagued by defections and shifting alliances. The nation found itself in political turmoil, hindering progress and development. In addition to political issues, the Amulree Report also highlights the economy's complexity and its susceptibility to external factors. Global events, such as the Weltkrieg, affected Newfoundland's financial stability. While the construction of the Newfoundland Railway was initially seen as a step towards progress, it eventually became a heavy financial burden that the nation struggled to bear. The Amulree Report's revelations serve as a sobering reminder of Newfoundland's challenges. Addressing political corruption and fostering responsible governance will be crucial for the nation's path towards economic stability and prosperity."

newfoundland.16.t:0 "[NFL.GetNameDef] Puts Labrador For Sale"
newfoundland.16.d:0 "It appears that due to severe financial issues and near bankruptcy, Newfoundland has put Labrador up for sale. Geographically, it is one of the easternmost provinces on continental Canada and is roughly triangular in shape. Labrador borders Quebec and hosts abundant mineral resources, although it primarily consists of thin soil. Labrador's sale is expected to bring in much needed funds to pay off Newfoundland's debt. It has a population of just a couple of thousand people and is home to a handful of small, rural towns. In the recent past, the provincial government has looked to develop Labrador's natural resources, including petroleum and rare earth minerals. However, the sale of this territory has been met with much opposition from indigenous tribes who claim that the land is their ancestral home and should not be sold off to be exploited."
newfoundland.16.a:0 "Sold!"
newfoundland.16.b:0 "Our limited funds are much better spent anywhere but here..."

newfoundland.17.t:0 "Labrador Sold to Canada"
newfoundland.17.d_fullprice:0 "The sale of Labrador has been finalized, and the territory is now in Canadian possession. Thankfully, the Ottawa government, either out of pity for Newfoundland or having recognized the potential of the region, has paid the full price! Our coffers aren't as empty as they used to be, allowing us to pursue some of our initiatives that we had originally planned but had to put off due to the ongoing crisis."
newfoundland.17.d_cheap:0 "The sale of Labrador has been finalized, with the territory now in Canadian possession. Regrettably, during the negotiations for the sale of the region, the Ottawa government forced us to lower the price, leaving us feeling unfairly treated. Although the government's coffers are not nearly empty anymore, some wonder if we would have been better off keeping Labrador..."
newfoundland.17.a:0 "We desperately needed the money."

newfoundland.18.t:0 "No Takers on Labrador Purchase"
newfoundland.18.d:0 "Labrador's initial sale did not go well at all. While the territory has significant potential with its wealth of mineral resources if properly developed, Canada seems hesitant about considering its acquisition at its current price. It appears they do not wish to be burdened with such a financial commitment, especially considering their ongoing priorities in Canadian politics."
newfoundland.18.a:0 "Drat!"
newfoundland.18.b:0 "Lower the price and send them the deal again!"

newfoundland.19.t:0 "Labrador Offered for a Reduced Price"
newfoundland.19.d:0 "Newfoundland has once again contacted us about the purchase of Labrador. Seemingly desperate for some financial relief through this sale, they have astoundingly reduced the price. Perhaps we should reconsider our original decision, especially considering the potential of the region?"
newfoundland.19.a:0 "Where's my chequebook, this is too good of a deal to pass up!"
newfoundland.19.b:0 "We told you once - no deal."

newfoundland.20.t:0 "No Sale on Labrador"
newfoundland.20.d:0 "Unfortunately, it appears that there will be no purchase of Labrador, as the potential of the territory has been greatly underappreciated and scoffed at by those in the Ottawa government. Without the sale, our options to reduce financial hardships in Newfoundland are drastically limited. We had hoped to fill our coffers with whatever we could obtain from it to fund upcoming initiatives to steadily rebuild the economy."
newfoundland.20.a:0 "Cheap Pricks..."

newfoundland.21.t:0 "The United Kingdom Restored"
newfoundland.21.d:0 "It is with immense gratitude to God's grace and the combined strength of Canada and the Exiles that the Entente has reclaimed its birthright, as the syndicalists in London have been purged through the might of our armies, navies, and airforces! This momentous achievement was the result of a united effort, although it came at a high cost. The lives lost in this endeavor will forever be remembered for their selfless sacrifice. Though the tide has turned in our favor, we must acknowledge that the path to restoring Britain to its former glory is challenging and lengthy. We cannot be certain if we will ever return to the days of yore. For now, Newfoundland is still under Canadian authority. This interim phase is crucial for establishing stability and rebuilding Britain to its former glory. It is vital that we work hand in hand with the Ottawa government to ensure a smooth transition to self-government and pave the way for a brighter future. Together, we shall strive to restore Newfoundland to its former glory and ensure that we are never compelled to relinquish our sovereignty."
newfoundland.21.a:0 "God Save the King, God Save the United Kingdom!"

newfoundland.22.t:0 "The Newfoundland National Convention"
newfoundland.22.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Second Weltkrieg and the restoration of the Exiles in London, along with subsequent recovery efforts, the Ottawa government has granted us the right to convene a forum to determine our future. In the Newfoundland National Convention, constitutional options will be debated and recommendations for a national referendum will be made. This referendum will include our right to responsible government and self-determination, which are crucial for shaping our destiny. During these discussions, some delegates expressed their sympathies with the Ottawa government and proposed integrating into Canada as one of its provinces. Although these individuals represent a minority, their ideas have reached the public through various media channels. They have elaborated on the potential economic and political benefits of such a union. Amidst these varying perspectives, the delegates have largely agreed upon three options: a return to dominion status, maintaining the current Commission of Government arrangement (status quo), or pursuing Confederation with Canada. These choices will be presented to the people in a national referendum, Newfoundland's fate determined by the people's will. In the event that no definite winner is determined in the first referendum, the two options with the highest percentage of votes will proceed to a second referendum, giving the people another opportunity to make their voices heard and shape Newfoundland's future."

The destitute men who have toiled for uncaring merchants, and who have been robbed of representation due to once-baseless fears of a Syndicalist uprising have moved to stage a massive protest, not unlike the one in 1932 which brought down the Squires Government, to object to the recent declaration of war against the Union of Britain by the King. In their own words, we can not possibly support a costly and far-off war declared by out of touch aristocrats when Newfoundland and its citizenry have been left severely hurting for funds and employment. The rangers sent to pad down this crowd of unruly workers expected to simply disperse the gathered crowd; and at worst they would be faced with a repeat of 1932’s harrowing events. Instead, to the horror of the police, the crowd of angry fishermen was heavily armed with British-supplied Submachine Guns. The shots that rang through St. Johns only ended after the mob of Fishermen broke through the hastily set-up ramparts, and stormed the Colonial Building; beating Governor Walwyn to within an inch of his life with the stocks of their British-provided weaponry as he tried to escape. The few members of the Commission who managed to survive quickly boarded a plane to Canada in an attempt to report the news and call in help.\n While they had assumed that this was just a mere riot which had grown out of control, the FPU’s seizure of the Colonial Building, and Coaker’s declaration of a Newfoundlander Revolution has proven that the seeds of Syndicalist discontent has run far deeper than the Commission has ever predicted..."

Unlike the rampage that nearly cost the life of Prime Minister Squires, this angry mob had succeeded in murdering the reason for their furious remonstrances. The inability of the Newfoundland Rangers to handle the situation was puzzling to the Canadians at first, however as the survivors recounted their stories it became clear that the angry mob was apparently heavily armed. While the source of these arms could easily be written off as old hunting rifles, some eyewitnesses recall that the weapons used were military-grade and resembled those used by our arch-enemy: the Union of Britain. The potential for an uprising in Newfoundland, while mulled over by some more paranoid members of our administration, is a shockingly unlikely scenario. However, if our worst fears were confirmed, then it would mean that the Syndicalists Devils would have a foothold right at our front door. .."

nfl_uprising.8.d:0 "Our worst fears have been confirmed, as the Marine division dispatched to the Avalon Peninsula to get a hold on the situation in St. Johns has come back with nothing but grim news. The scattered incidents of agitation that could once be written off as coincidence now come together to paint a much darker picture of an extensive web of Syndicalist infiltration. The fishing boats firing on Canadian Ships, the British Spies disguised as dockworkers, the British airdrops in Labrador; all were part of an insidious plan to capture Newfoundland and use it as a springboard for the invasion of the rest of Canada. Our commanders, while confident in their ability to quickly dispatch these insurgents, have raised their concerns about the possibility of a long-term war fought near Canadian borders."

nfl_uprising.11.d:0 "While the men of the Fishermen's Protective Union and their Syndicalist Backers had attempted to resist the might of Canada’s army, it appears that all their efforts are now finally all in vain. The squalid remnants of Newfoundland’s Syndicalist government officially signed their surrender in the bombed-out hall where the FPU was once founded. The Unionists had offered to evacuate rebellion leader William Coaker before the fall of Port Union, however the aging Union man refused the offer, instead choosing to stay in his homeland and face the Canadian’s justice. Primary organizers such as Joey Smallwood have been caught in futile attempts to flee to Chicago; Peter John Cashin was found dead near an explosion site in Conception Bay, grasping the Pink, White and Green flag in his arms.\n\n In the wake of this catastrophe, the Canadian Government has elected to incorporate the territories of Newfoundland directly into their nation, administering the territories themselves without any subsidiary governance. The grave failures of the Commission used as direct evidence that Newfoundland is fundamentally unready for self-governance on any level.  "
nfl_uprising.11.a:0 "A valiant, if not futile effort."

NFL_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Dominion of Newfoundland, despite being Britain's oldest colony, may also be the Empire's most unstable. A devastating economic downturn combined with political instability from the 1932 riot against the Squires government has the small nation on edge, and while Responsible Government has managed to survive the countless tumults of the last 20 years, it seems that the tightrope walked by the Dominion will break under the slightest pressure. Sandwiched between the New World and the Old, Newfoundland must balance between the pervasive influences of Canadian Sympathizers, Republican Agitators, Syndicalist Agents, Loyal Administrators and Aboriginal Activists as they forge towards the future."

### Leaders ###

POLITICS_COAKER_DESC:0 "Sir William Ford Coaker is a man who has been loved and despised, revered and vilified. To some he was an agitator, a rogue, a scoundrel, a crook. To others, a great reformer, a patriot, a genius, a fearless leader and a champion of the common man - and a kind of Messiah who led them out of economic bondage. As perhaps the most titanic living personality within the scene of Newfoundlander Politics, Coaker can boast about a career in politics starting before the creation of the Dominion of Newfoundland, and one which has seen to outlive it. As a young man, Coaker had lived in a nation whose government was by the rich for the rich, controlled by a conniving cartel of Fish Merchants who lived very comfortably marketing the product produced by those who existed a hopeless and soul-destroying existence. From his youngest working days, Coaker sought to dismantle the archaic system of credit which the hardworking seafaring people of Newfoundland had been shackled to, even organizing strikes which increased the wages of fish handles to 40 cents a day when he was just 13. During days and nights toiling on his farm, Coaker's dream advanced, a dream of a Newfoundland from the yoke of greedy Merchants and callous Politicians. And in an Orange Hall on one fateful night, Coaker's dream would become reality, as the Fishermen’s Protective Union would be formed, an organization where the Fishermen of Newfoundland could rally under one banner for better conditions and pay. As the FPU entered the newly-christened Dominion's political scene, it became clear that Coaker sought not to rule, but rather to hold a balance of power, which was evidenced by the FPU's coalition with Sir Robert Bond's Liberal Party. This alliance with the Liberal Party would persevere throughout several governments, and despite the FPU's eventual assertion that rule by Commission would be the best way forward. Indeed, by 1932 Coaker was a bitter, defeated man and a strong advocate of an end to politics in Newfoundland. Coaker, the 'Radical and Nationalistman' who had once argued that the Governor of Newfoundland should be a Newfoundlander, ended up playing a key role in preparing the country to accept the loss of responsible government. However by 1936, it became clear that this 'Commission' Government advocated not for a 'Rest From Politics', but rather for a return to Merchant rule and suppression of Organized Labour under baseless claims of Syndicalist infiltration. After a meeting with British agents and Newfoundland Nationalist Peter John Cashin, Coaker eventually came to the conclusion that the only way for Newfoundland to be free from the grasp of the merchants was to work with Red London to break free from the Empire Coaker was once so loyal to."

The ensuing political crisis led to the decimation of the Liberals and Fredrick Alderdice’s United Newfoundland Party gaining power. While Responsible Government has thus far held on by a thread, it is clear that most Newfoundlanders, including those Governing the Dominion, have grown disillusioned with Democracy. Frustration with Democracy in the wake of the Great Depression has reached a high, and some wonder that another crisis may just push our nation over the edge."

With any hope our nation will recover, slowly."

The few markets we have access to no longer want to purchase our products, and our creditors don't have enough funds to sustain our economy. We have few assets at our disposal, and if we wish to dig ourselves out of this hole we must work hard."

First suffering cataclysmic losses at Gallipoli, and then losing 90 percent of our regiment over the course of about 30 minutes while under British command during the first Battle of the Somme at the disastrous Capture of Beaumont-Hamel, those few brave Newfies who answered the Crown's call to arms were met with largely nothing aside swift and brutal death. This poor performance in the Weltkrieg has been a source of shame for our army, who now see the need to prepare properly for a conflict as paramount."

While the volume of postage has never been a considerable factor in the nation's revenue, it has required substantial upkeep to keep the system running.

### Focuses ###

NFL_commission_of_govt:0 "The Commission of Government"
NFL_commission_of_govt_desc:0 "Following the increasing failure of our native parties and representatives to get us out of the economic rut we’ve been wallowing in for years now, the Canadians have been granted direct Commission of our government. While not too dissimilar to the direct colonial rule we had before being granted Dominionship, Our citizenry are very enthusiastic about having a government in charge whose sole task is to alleviate our commonly felt ailing."
NFL_defanged_labour_movement:0 "Defanged Labour Movement"
NFL_defanged_labour_movement_desc:0 "It is typically thought that the fairly conservative population of Newfoundland would never grant syndicalism a breeding place within our unions, yet complacency can kill. So while we will not take direct action against our unionized communities, we will take the precaution of removing their ability to organize leadership and strikes, to prevent the red’s opportunity."
NFL_cooperate_with_coaker:0 "Cooperate with Coaker"
NFL_cooperate_with_coaker_desc:0 "The Commission’s mission is revolving around the key idea of giving faith back into the Newfoundland people, faith in their government to keep their jobs and trade secure. So we should approach the Fishermen’s Protective Union of Coaker and other Labour oriented groups with a velvet glove to give them faith in the Commission’s intentions. While a strengthened labour movement might play a progressive role in Newfoundland, the Commission has recognized that such a movement would have to be carefully monitored to make sure that its unionism would be of a non-threatening kind."
NFL_crush_the_unions:0 "Suppress the Unions"
NFL_crush_the_unions_desc:0 "Having a highly unionized population, especially in the fishing trades, Newfoundland’s working population is highly organized. And The Commission, remembering what happened in Britain when a pessimistic union population rallied and brought about the dreadful syndicalist revolution, shall never allow that to happen on this Domain’s shores. numquam dimitte numquam obliviscar!"
NFL_work_with_civilian_govt:0 "Work with the Civilian Government"
NFL_work_with_civilian_govt_desc:0 "While nominally we have total control over the affairs of Newfoundland, we have allowed those already elected to legislature to retain those seats, so long as they were not those convicted of corruption charges. There remains no reason to tread over the Newfoundlanders' self representation, especially when it could further push resistant elements against us."
NFL_crush_cashin:0 "Clear Out Cashin's Rabble"
NFL_crush_cashin_desc:0 "A more progressive oriented member of the Liberals, Peter John Cashin had been fine living outside of politics after the loss of his seat. Yet it appears that the appointment of our Commission had just rubbed him wrong, citing our efforts as a Canadian conspiracy against Newfoundland and removal of self-representation. His back-bench revolt against our commission is proving quite the headache, so let us remove more power from his opposition."
NFL_ode_to_newfoundland:0 "Ode to Newfoundland"
NFL_ode_to_newfoundland_desc:0 "With the efforts of the Commission being felt as economic woes begin to glacially drift away from the sheer disaster it was before, and with the Newfoundland people being able to say they joined in the efforts to alleviate themselves out of the depression, it has come with a surge of national pride. Already folk songs are being written, and people see the influence the Commission has made on our isle."
NFL_advisory_committee:0 "Create the Advisory Committee"
NFL_advisory_committee_desc:0 "Although we have taken control over Newfoundland from the natives, we must not totally throw them to the wind as after all, it was Alderdice’s government who invited us here to resolve the economic and corruptive woes of the nation. So we will set up a committee of Native Newfoundlanders of varying ideologies to give advice on how to resolve the state of affairs we see ourselves in."
NFL_status_of_the_mayor:0 "Status of the Mayor"
NFL_status_of_the_mayor_desc:0 "As it stands, the position of Mayor of St. John’s remains the highest-ranking elected official in the nation. To many Newfoundlanders, Mayor Andrew Carnell stands as the voice of the people, as one of the few men in our great Dominion to be in an elected position of power. However, to the Commission, the Mayor and the City Council remain nothing more than an inefficient nuisance. A decision must be made about the ultimate position of the Mayor of St. John’s."
NFL_rest_from_politics:0 "A Rest from Politics"
NFL_rest_from_politics_desc:0 "It’s apparent that besides the inability of Newfoundland to manage itself, it also has the issue of the two partisan parties of Liberals and United Newfoundland Party to point fingers at each other in a manner which only further divides the tired nation. We will put a hold on this divisive politicking by freezing elections, with the Newfoundland legislature being resigned to the members currently in office remaining there."
NFL_benevolent_dictatorship:0 "A Benevolent Dictatorship"
NFL_benevolent_dictatorship_desc:0 "It was never the intention of the colonial office’s assigned governor to trample over Newfoundlander life and liberty, and so the wider Commission will ensure that it is not viewed as a seizure of democratic ideals, but of a body of temporary caretakers, a government of nannies to bandage the gash that the great depression put into Newfoundland."
NFL_continue_commission_activies:0 "Continue Commission Activities"
NFL_continue_commission_activies_desc:0 "With the startling finds in the Amulree report showing a complete inability of Newfoundlanders to maintain their coffers, their education system and keep corruption to a minimum, the Commission has shown a lack of faith in returning leadership back over just yet. And so while there remains this large of an issue in Newfoundland’s very core, Ottawa’s influence is here to stay."
NFL_empower_newfoundland_rangers:0 "Empower the Newfoundland Rangers"
NFL_empower_newfoundland_rangers_desc:0 "Originally founded in the wake of the devastating 1932 Riot, the Newfoundland Rangers are a small RCMP-inspired law enforcement agency dedicated to keeping order in Newfoundland's smaller communities. In Canada proper, the RCMP has been given additional responsibilities defined in their Bill C-7, leading many in Newfoundland to propose a similar arrangement for our Rangers. While some have decried the creation of a Newfoundland 'Secret Police', we trust that the expanded Ranger Force will help keep all of our citizens safe."
NFL_promise_of_democracy:0 "The Unbroken Promise of Democracy"
NFL_promise_of_democracy_desc:0 "Freedom. Democracy. Liberty. These sacred words make up the founding motto of our proud Entente forces. While Newfoundland may have given up these values, we have given them up voluntarily, trusting that they shall return at a time when our nation is on more solid footing. As a rare example of a people who have willingly forfeited Democracy, the Commission has taken up the role of an Enlightened Autocrats, willing and ready to restore the freedoms that have been lost as soon as the people demand it."
NFL_idealized_system_of_government:0 "The Idealized System of Governance"
NFL_idealized_system_of_government_desc:0 "Newfoundland is a rather unusual example of a nation which has forfeited its Democracy entirely through its own volition. The inherent corruption of the Democratic system has led the people to demand with one voice the revocation of their so-called 'Responsible Government' and a return to the guidance of the Crown. Much to our delight, the Canadians have followed suit with our example, even taking inspiration from Newfoundland's own Commission of Government for their policies."
NFL_expert_guidance:0 "Expert Guidance"
NFL_expert_guidance_desc:0 "The foundational belief of the Commission Government was that the people of Newfoundland had lost faith in their elected leaders, and had demanded a council of non-political Experts lead our country into a brighter future. A more-planned and centrally controlled society and a rationalized state apparatus in which a greater role for experts shall provide the basis for more positive action. Under their watch, our restructured state shall soon be capable of the swift and effective action needed to deal with the many crises facing our nation."
NFL_the_consolidation:0 "The Consolidation"
NFL_the_consolidation_desc:0 "With Canada being incorporated into the 'New' United Kingdom, many have demanded that Newfoundland fall suit and voluntarily incorporate themselves with the new Empire directly. Taking the example of Australia and New Zealand, as well as Kenya and Uganda in Africa, Newfoundland shall join with Canada to form a better, stronger nation for all subjects of his Majesty."
NFL_god_guard_the_smiling_land:0 "God Guard Thee [NFLGetLyricName] Land"
NFL_god_guard_the_smiling_land_desc:0 "To say that Newfoundland has been through hard times as of late is perhaps the understatement of the century. Yet under the grace of God and His Majesty the King, it seems that things are starting to look up. While countless men are out of work and a general sense of malaise still grips our populace, a sense of confidence around the future has developed thanks to the Commission. While we can never be sure of the future, for the first time in nearly a decade, things in Newfoundland seem to be looking up."
NFL_early_restoration_of_democracy:0 "Preemptive Democratic Restoration"
NFL_early_restoration_of_democracy_desc:0 "With the wishes of the Canadian foreign office to put all effort into future liberation of the Home Isles, we must make the call to end the Commission whenever best available, and with the economic woes of Newfoundland receding quicker than expected, we can restore democracy back to the natives before any anxiety over autonomy needlessly grows."
NFL_amulree_report:0 "The Amulree Report"
NFL_amulree_report_desc:0 "First Baron Amulree, William Mackenzie is finally ready to report his discoverings about Newfoundland’s economy, its state of affairs in education, resource extraction and further look into the effects of the depression (and now black monday) upon the Dominion. It's expected the report will be bleak, but once the Commission is granted clarity over our hardships, they can immediately set to work upon fixing our woes."
NFL_direct_releif_efforts:0 "Direct Relief Efforts"
NFL_direct_releif_efforts_desc:0 "What should have been considered extinct in the Dominions of the Entente, malnutrition and famine is beginning to peek its unwelcome head into our beloved Newfoundland, as the economic state has meant that the ability to purchase food is increasingly in danger as time has not proven kindly to our fishers and communities. The commission will not allow people to drop dead from hunger under their watch, so let the soup kitchens open!"
NFL_pay_down_our_debt:0 "Pay Down Our Debts"
NFL_pay_down_our_debt_desc:0 "One further burden upon the Dominion’s back was the pressured need to pay back Canada, the Algiers regime and Australasia for the loans we had taken out back during the Weltkrieg and irresponsible construction projects. The Commission if anything is further harried by this pressure, as they answer directly back to Ottawa and so must set about actually completing the task of alleviating our debts."
NFL_crown_corporations:0 "Assistance from Crown Corporations"
NFL_crown_corporations_desc:0 "Utilized by Ottawa to great extent to both drag themselves out of the Depression, but also to maintain employment and military prowess, Crown Corporations can be a very welcome addition to the Newfoundland regiment and its industry."
NFL_canadian_aid:0 "Aid from Canada"
NFL_canadian_aid_desc:0 "Utilizing Canada’s willingness to actually give material support to the Commission over a potentially irresponsible Newfoundlander government, we shall request the machinery and material aid to begin building more of an industry to employ the populace in. We proved to be loyal to the cause in the Weltkrieg, let us again prove our worth in a potential second Weltkrieg with the smokestacks of industry."
NFL_deal_with_corruption:0 "Dealing with Corruption"
NFL_deal_with_corruption_desc:0 "Unfortunately one of the most damning discoveries by the Amulree Report was that the corruption that had been known during the Squires premiership was not final, and that even the UNP that succeeded the liberals had many shady dealings of public funds. If we are to return control back over to elected parties, then we must purge the seemingly entrenched spoils system of Newfoundlander governance."
NFL_balance_the_books:0 "Balance the Books"
NFL_balance_the_books_desc:0 "It is commonly known by both Newfoundlanders and by our creditors back in Canada, that one of the biggest factors for Newfoundland’s debt and near bankruptcy is because of the expenses of the Newfoundland Railway. Yet surprisingly even after the sheer losses incurred by it, the Commission has found that the prior governments of Liberals and United both kept putting money towards it. It’s time the Commission made this revelation public and finally cut the costs of these continued expenditures."
NFL_sale_of_labrador:0 "The Sale of Labrador"
NFL_sale_of_labrador_desc:0 "These are dire times for the Dominion, and if the Commission is to sustain any credibility about their genuine effort to restore the economy back to its prior state, then we might have to consider more drastic options. The larger landmass of Labrador in the Dominion has not had many returns to efforts to profit off it, and so in order to procure funds of our own, we may have to auction it off to Canada."
NFL_further_borrowing:0 "Further Borrowing"
NFL_further_borrowing_desc:0 "Whilst Newfoundland debt is already a known issue, it has become apparent to the Commission of Government that if we are to begin the public work and employment efforts to get the Dominion’s economy kickstarted, we will have to consider requesting more grants from Ottawa to even fund these projects, though that means the foreseen problem of just rising our loan interest higher."
NFL_civil_service_cuts:0 "Civil Service Cuts"
NFL_civil_service_cuts_desc:0 "An unwelcome measure, but in order to further unburden our financial state, we will have to begin laying off the public servants of the prior Dominion administrations, ones that are no longer essential to the operation of the government with the introduction of the Commission. We will have to contemplate what sectors to lay off, but it’s estimated at least 1/3rd must go."
NFL_towards_corpratism:0 "Towards Corporatism"
NFL_towards_corpratism_desc:0 "The Commission has outlined, much to the chagrin of some elements within Newfoundland, an ambitious plan to heal our ailing economy. Our storm-bound lands shall be barren no longer, as the Commission works to build a true class-collaborative wonderland, lush with jobs and economic opportunities for our citizens. While the state-funding and nationalization of key industries is derided as Syndicalism by our traditional Merchant base, we trust that a non-Syndicalist collectivist system is our best way to reach a prosperous future."

NFL_second_commission:0 "The Second Commission"
NFL_second_commission_desc:0 "With the attempt to restore autonomy to the Newfoundland people and give faith back into their representative parties ending up in failure, a second Royal Commission of Governance has been issued from Ottawa, and this one is much more open to Canadian influence as the assigned Commission’s patience has thinned."
NFL_state_capitalism:0 "Institute State Capitalism"
NFL_state_capitalism_desc:0 "Both to keep Newfoundland’s economy afloat in dire times, but also to ensure it is fully attuned to wartime readiness much like Newfoundland was during the Weltkrieg, we shall have the Commission have an active hand in the management of Mercantile business and trade here on this isle."
NFL_clean_up_govt:0 "Cleaning Up the Government"
NFL_clean_up_govt_desc:0 "In order to keep the Commission's grasp over Newfoundland steady, while also ensuring punishment of those who had kept knocking the Dominion into the dirt due to their corrupt practices, we will use the Commission assigned Attorney General to try and prosecute those ministers of all previous governments who had a hand in the dealings."
NFL_imperial_industry:0 "Imperial Industry"
NFL_imperial_industry_desc:0 "Whereas before, the Commission had welcomed yet paced the Crown Corporations and Industries entering Newfoundland to ensure they were just additions rather than a takeover of native markets, this concern is not to be contemplated with this second rite of government. Much needed manufactories will be opened directly upon the isle to industrialize."
NFL_formal_mercantalism:0 "Formalize the Mercantilist System"
NFL_formal_mercantalism_desc:0 "While Newfoundland fishermen had always been very keen on exporting their labour and business abroad to any who would give them coin, this prior practice had been very self-centered and even harmful to the bay communities at home. Thus the Commission will embrace the export of Newfoundland goods, but with the goal of enriching the Dominion."
NFL_quaerite_prime_regnum_dei:0 "Quaerite Prime Regnum Dei"
NFL_quaerite_prime_regnum_dei_desc:0 "Love thy neighbor as one loves thyself. And now with the Commission having to ask itself if the effort to put faith and power back into Newfoundlander hands will end up in disappointment once more, if rather the solution to be found is bringing the loyal Dominion into the Canadian fold, where they will surely find better funding and governance than from the repeated failures of the self."
NFL_further_suspension_of_civil_liberties:0 "Further Suspension of Civil Liberties"
NFL_further_suspension_of_civil_liberties_desc:0 "With the citizenry having come into unrest once more with the failings of the previous elected government to handle the finances, a disgusting mirror of the riot of ‘32 happened. Now with it being apparent that the Newfoundland people are willing to surge into the streets against the government if they feel unsatisfied, we need to be more strict in our law enforcement."
NFL_danger_of_democracy:0 "The Dangers of Democracy"
NFL_danger_of_democracy_desc:0 "Going off the first commission’s very warm welcome into Newfoundland due to the citizenry’s own lack of faith in their elected representatives, we will piggyback off rousing this belief into a flame against any further elections and organization of executive or legislative leadership by the people, for what good has ever come to this island from those efforts?"
NFL_emphasise_temporary_nature:0 "Refuse to Abandon Democracy"
NFL_emphasise_temporary_nature_desc:0 "Despite the continued follies of mismanaged finances here in Newfoundland, the Commission will do no favors to the people it is trying to assist by setting up a permanent station here, completely stripping Newfoundlanders of their autonomy. Thus we shall once more go hand in hand with the advisory committee and strive to make elections possible once more."
NFL_wartime_emergency_powers:0 "Temporary Emergency Powers"
NFL_wartime_emergency_powers_desc:0 "With Newfoundland and the wider Entente going into a wartime state as the march towards liberation begins, The Commission will have to secure and mobilize the isle to ensure our readiness for war with the syndicalist menace. But we shall legislate our wartime laws so that they are just temporary, much like the commission's authority."

NFL_plot_begins:0 "The Plot Against Canada"
NFL_plot_begins_desc:0 "While many have graciously allowed the Canadians to trample on our sovereignty without fuss, a certain number of workers, ever tired of the tyranny of the bosses, have reached their breaking point. The workers of our great nation have had enough of Newfoundland’s Merchant Master Class and their Canadian enablers; while dislodging them may take a constrained effort, we are ready for whatever tribulations breaking our chains may entail."
NFL_mobilize_opposition_against_the_commission:0 "Mobilize Opposition Against the Commission"
NFL_mobilize_opposition_against_the_commission_desc:0 "Before the tyranny of the Commission put an end to any such faint dreams of Democracy, a great man by the name of Richard Squires fought tooth and nail along with Coaker to ensure that our workers would breathe free. Derided by the Merchants and the Newspapers under their sway, Squires’ tenure would not last, uprooted tragically by the great Riot of ‘32. Ever a champion of returning to our democracy lost, Squires has been left with no other options; the Commission is here to stay, and the best chance to return the power of Newfoundland’s fate to its people resides with the Union of Britain. A great irony, considering how much Squires fought against associations with Syndicalists during his time in power..."
NFL_mobilize_irish_diaspora:0 "Utilize the Irish Diaspora"
NFL_mobilize_irish_diaspora_desc:0 "A great many citizens of our great nation belong to Irish ancestry, and are now beginning to express a similar distaste to British rule as their cousins back in the Emerald Isle. While a great deal of the FPU's support base comes from the Protestant Faith, a cooling relationship with the Catholic Church combined with growing Anti-Canadian and Anti-Empire sentiment has added fuel to the soon-to-be ignited fires of Revolution within Newfoundland, and has secured the support of another group for the FPU’s anti-Reactionary ‘Grand Coalition’. The calls for a 'Newfoundland Sinn Fein' echoing from the Avalon Peninsula combined with greater attention from Socialist Groups across the Atlantic are signals to many that the Irish Diaspora will be content in their own oppression no more."
NFL_recruit_unemployed:0 "Recruit the Unemployed"
NFL_recruit_unemployed_desc:0 "A great many men in St. John's lie destitute and desperate for any means of income. Seeing this as an opportunity, the Syndicalists have recruited these men as agitators, ever eager to tear down the systems of oppression the moment the right moment strikes. The decline of the FPU shall be reversed, as we spread our brand of Unionism from the traditional stronghold of the fisheries, into the mines and forests, where loggers and miners toil in unfair conditions."
NFL_organize_the_unions:0 "Organize the Unions"
NFL_organize_the_unions_desc:0 "The Fishermen's Protective Union has long battled for the inherent rights of every worker. In the process, the FPU has amassed a large amount of sway within the Newfie political scene. While the Commission has cracked down on such ‘Syndicalist’ organizations, the workers of Newfoundland continue to commiserate and meet under the banner of the FPU despite it being officially outlawed. Just like in Britain, a revolution is brewing; and the Unions are set to be first to answer the Clarion Call once the Revolution arrives."
NFL_abandon_nonradicalism:0 "Abandon Non-Radicalism"
NFL_abandon_nonradicalism_desc:0 "So long has the Fishermen's Protective Union been derided as a Syndicalist organization, despite every assurance otherwise. At a certain point fighting accusations of Syndicalism has become fighting against our own interests; now, Syndicalism stands as our only hope to free the working men of Newfoundland from the bosses’ oppression. If the Merchants want to see what a truly Syndicalist workingman's organization looks like, they are about to bear witness to the dawn of true Unionism."
NFL_sabatoge_recovery_efforts:0 "Sabotage Recovery Efforts"
NFL_sabatoge_recovery_efforts_desc:0 "While most workers see through the veneer for what the Commission truly is, some have been fooled by their lukewarm promises of economic recovery. To prevent our more gullible citizenry from being swayed by the Commission’s Siren Song, we must sabotage the Commission’s efforts to help the economy recover. The workers of Newfoundland shall be made to see that the only solution to their woes is the guiding hand of Syndicalism."
NFL_cooperate_with_cashin:0 "The Cashin-Coaker Alliance"
NFL_cooperate_with_cashin_desc:0 "Peter John Cashin and William Coaker have forged a strange partnership. While typically Coaker would want nothing to do with such a brazen plot against the Empire, the wanton persecution of the FPU by the Commission has driven Coaker to desperate means. Through violent or nonviolent means, Coaker and Cashin are determined to dismantle the Commission and Imperial influence in Newfoundland once and for all."
NFL_anti_canadian_fearmongering:0 "Fearmonger Against the Canadians"
NFL_anti_canadian_fearmongering_desc:0 "The Canadians have never stopped attempting to control Newfoundland, from the Labrador Boundary Disputes of the past, to their unjust usurpation of British Duties. It has become clear that the greatest threat to our sovereignty lies in Ottawa, and if we are to escape from Canadian clutches, we must turn to our oldest friend and protector: Britain."
NFL_mobilize_veterans:0 "Never Another Somme, Hamel, or Gallipoli"
NFL_mobilize_veterans_desc:0 "Hamel, the Somme, Gallipoli. All battles fought in wars on foreign shores where brave sons of Newfoundland laid down their lives for London's bitter lies of 'Dulce et decorum est pro patria mori'. Years after the slaughter 'King and Country' once more calls to use our people as mere fodder in their madman's dream of reclaiming a lost Empire. The veterans of foreign wars fought under the Union Jack have now come to realize that they have been forsaken by the very Empire they once fought to protect. As the Canadians ready themselves for a surely suicidal advance against the London Government, the people of Newfoundland are united under this chant: 'Never Another Somme, Never Another Hamel, Never Another Gallipoli'."
NFL_disinformation_web:0 "Restored Oath of Secrecy"
NFL_disinformation_web_desc:0 "While most of the government remains pitifully in the dark about the true nature of our plot, there are still those who excel at sniffing out signs of dissent. These troublemakers have been pressuring the big-whigs in St. John's to further look into our activities, possibly even stumbling onto some concrete evidence of British involvement. To counter this, London has sent over the best in the secret-keeping business to aid in our cause. From fake towns, fake Radio broadcasts and reliable alibis, this renowned effort by the British will help keep the Commission safely in the dark and out of our affairs." 
NFL_appeal_to_smalwood:0 "Get Smallwood on Our Side"
NFL_appeal_to_smalwood_desc:0 "It has come as a surprise to many that Joey Smallwood, the darling of the Confederationist Movement and one of the strongest supporters of Squires’ Government, was once of Newfoundland’s most fervent red-blooded Socialists. Despite abandoning his Socialist ideals to be more palatable to our nonradical political scene, Smallwood, along with his Newfoundland Federation of Labour, have been driven firmly to the side of Coaker’s plot. It has unfortunately become clear that the Unions of Newfoundland can no longer coexist with the Commission, and for our fair Terra Nova to be free from the bosses, we must turn to radical; even Syndicalist means."
NFL_support_from_the_uob:0 "Covert Support from the UoB"
NFL_support_from_the_uob_desc:0 "As the world simmers and teeters on the brink of World War, it has been increasingly clear that Newfoundland’s revolution-in-waiting is not going to be completed peacefully. Alone and far-removed from Europe’s epicenters of Socialism, our hopes for survival against a superior Canadian foe are slim; to even have a fighting chance, we must turn to London for any support that could possibly be given. The Union of Britain will begin supplying our revolution-to-be, allowing us to covertly prepare for our uprising, hopefully without drawing too much suspicion from the Canadians."

No longer shall we here on the frozen Atlantic coasts play second fiddle to these dubious elitists. And no longer shall we Newfies go hungry as wider Canada feasts in gluttonous excess.

In our armed forces, the poor shall be fed and paid and cared for, giving them reason to live since they sure as shit don’t have any currently, and who knows.

The few stockpiles of equipment, arms, and artillery are all old museum pieces or whatever meager armories our farmers and rural homesteaders have amassed on their own in private, even including some P53 Enfield rifle-muskets recently salvaged from a deep-sea wreck a few miles off our shores, and some old Hypo Helmets from the Great War - early tubeless gasmasks made up of canvas hoods soaked in chlorine-absorbing chemicals, invented by Newfoundland's own Cluny Macpherson. Though many will likely take issue with the idea, we shall raid our own countryside to requisition as many of these dated firearms as we can, for when the Canadian hordes arrive, even your grandpappy’s old hunting rifle will be of use to us if placed in the right, well-trained hands."

We must dig in and hold on against all odds and at any cost in order to ensure this dream is made reality.

NFL_end_truck_wages:0 "An End to Truck Wages"
NFL_end_truck_wages_desc:0 "It was a common predatory practice in Newfoundland to give fishermen their starting tools in exchange for debt in credit.

However, with most of this legislative body being located in Nova Scotia across the sea, for now, we shall have to make due with the one district we do have.

Taking inspiration from this legacy, we shall expand the districts once again to include the White territories of our state, including the former colonizers in our political system in order to foster unity, equality, and cooperation between our two groups while also ensuring that the White Man is fully out of our hair as we work to revitalize our way of life."

However, this Christian foundation also puts us on an equal playing field with our White Newfoundlander citizens, opening up the perfect avenue in order to spread the idea of peaceful cooperation and friendly autonomy between our communities. Using our shared belief in God and a devil, we shall build a bridge between our two groups, uniting Newfoundland through faith and trust while still allowing our two groups to live our own lives as we each please."

Together, these spirits and many others serve as the guardians of nature, but in this rapidly modernizing world, the wider population has less and less time for such whimsical thought. We must work to re-enshrine the importance of these fae beings and others like them among the masses as we work to protect our natural world and pursue environmentalist policies, for only with a strong connection to a vibrant and thriving natural world can mankind truly prosper and be at peace."

When our tribe adopted Christianity, Glooscap became our interpretation of Jesus Christ, and we have awaited his return ever since, for that is when he shall lead our people to their final salvation and true paradise. Luckily for us, we might have found this reincarnation of Glooscap in our own Joe Jeddore! Though he shrinks away from any direct comparison, Jeddore is as close to a Glooscap-like figure we have, being the savior and guide of our people as we dash into the wide open unknown of autonomy and independence in this strange, modern world.

Though we may have linguistic and cultural differences, that is nothing we cannot overcome, and together we shall be stronger than ever before. By raising these fellow natives up to an equal standing with ourselves and the White Newfies with the help of figures like the Inuit artist Kiakshuk, we shall finally be able to build a truly egalitarian confederacy of autonomous ethnic and cultural governments that are all united and equally dedicated to the idea of maintaining a prosperous and free Newfoundland."

By expanding the wampum industry in order to capitalize on this luxury while also expanding our handicrafts markets and wider domestic industry in other major fields we specialize in such as salmon fishing and deep-sea trawling, caribou, bear, and moose hunting, and much more, we shall build a traditional economy partially built on market economics fused with tribal barter methods and the few good policies of our socialist predecessors in order to breed the perfect Mi’kmaq economy."

Also working to improve education along with socio-economic and diplomatic concerns, the Forum shall be paired with the creation of the Mi'kmaw Kina'matnewey which shall oversee a massive swathe of educational modernization efforts and reform in order to eradicate illiteracy and lack of basic education on the island.

Though these radicals were way out of line, Jeddore has been enamored by some of their less revolutionary, more humanitarian and egalitarian policies. Seeking to strip most of the Socialist state away while keeping some of the beneficial progressive steps forwards, Jeddore and the truncated Grand Council shall create a fusion of Newfoundland’s recent socialist reality with its White capitalist past and its First Nations origin, and now future, in order to create a wildly syncretic and pragmatic economic system that provides for all without resorting to foul ideological dogma."

Together we shall make this Dawnland our paradise all gilded and gold, entirely free from the machinations of foreign powers so long as we help them in their petty conflicts.

NFL_merchant_class_support_desc:0 "The Merchant Class has proven to be the most loyal and most consistent backers of the UNP and their agenda. Our fruitful friendship with these groups precedes the 'United Newfoundland Party' as a party, and even the foundation of our Dominion itself. With the support of our Conservative Government, we shall ensure that the influence of the Merchants remains unchallenged for the years to come."

NFL_god_save_the_dominion_desc:0 "Under the watch and vigilance of the UNP, the policy of Newfoundland shall be one of unflinching loyalty and dedication to His Majesty King [CAN_king_full_name] and the Reclamation Efforts. God Save the King - God Save Newfoundland and God Save the Entente!"

NFL_liberals:0 "The Liberals"
NFL_liberals_desc:0 "Representative of Catholic and lower-class interests, the Newfoundland Liberals have triumphed in the recent elections. Suffering a tremendous loss in 1932 after revelations of endemic corruption, the return of the Liberals is the comeback of the decade. While they have clawed their way away from political oblivion, Squires still has an uphill battle ahead of him to prove that the terrible events of 1932 shall never repeat."
NFL_liberals_alone:0 "Squires Rules Alone"
NFL_liberals_alone_desc:0 "Instead of continuing the old alliance between the Liberals and now-decrepit FPU, Squires has shored up support within his own party. While we have a great deal of respect for the FPU and their accomplishments, the years have not been kind to our old friends, and it has become clear that the FPU can no longer exert influence in the political stage."
NFL_coaker_coalition:0 "Coalition with Coaker"
NFL_coaker_coalition_desc:0 "To keep whatever miniscule influence they once held intact, the Fishermen's Protective Union has once more been forced into a Coalition with the Liberals. The Liberals and the FPU, both struggling to survive in the new Newfoundland, see cooperation as the best way to salvage some part of the Old Order."
NFL_balanced_budget:0 "A Balanced Budget"
NFL_balanced_budget_desc:0 "To keep our country from falling into the grasps of a second Commission, we must keep our books balanced. The Liberal Government has thus argued for balanced budgets, strict financial management, and retrenchment policies."
NFL_economic_diversification:0 "Diversify Our Economy"
NFL_economic_diversification_desc:0 "For too long Newfoundland has relied on Fishing as the Economy's primary guide. Under the watch of the Liberal Government, we shall begin expanding our sources of income to include mining, resource extraction and tourism."
NFL_fisheries_reform:0 "Fisheries Reform"
NFL_fisheries_reform_desc:0 "Coaker has allied with Squires in exchange for a final attempt at fisheries reform. While previous attempts to do so were met with failure, Squires is confident that this time will be successful. Thus, William Coaker shall once more be appointed as the Minister of Marine and Fisheries for our great Dominion."
NFL_party_of_the_poor:0 "Party of the Poor"
NFL_party_of_the_poor_desc:0 "As opposed to the UNP Conservatives and their Merchant backers, the Liberal Party has firmly established itself as a Party of the Poor. Utilizing our connections with Newfoundland's poorer and working-class citizenry, we shall establish a solid voting bloc which can work to challenge the stranglehold of Merchants on our political system."
NFL_denounce_commission:0 "Tarnish the Commission's Legacy"
NFL_denounce_commission_desc:0 "Throughout his tenure Richard Squires has campaigned against direct rule by the British Crown, standing as a stalwart defender of Newfoundlander Democracy and national pride. With the Commission's day now coming to a close, Squires has put an end to those who seek to whitewash the Commission, revealing its truth as an ugly and autocratic institution which served to keep the people of our great nation in the dark."
NFL_denounce_accusations_of_syndicalism:0 "Denounce Accusations of Syndicalism"
NFL_denounce_accusations_of_syndicalism_desc:0 "Baseless accusations of Syndicalism hampered the ability of previous Liberal Government's to function. To move forward, we must put these damaging rumors of supposed Syndicalist associations to rest once and for all."
NFL_support_oarnge_order:0 "Support from the Orange Order"
NFL_support_oarnge_order_desc:0 "Richard Squires' membership in the Orange Order is quite puzzling to some considering his leadership of the majority Catholic Liberal Party. Despite certain 'conflicts' between the Orange Order and the Liberals' Catholic Electorate, the Order's status as the few Democratic organizations operating during the Commission period has cemented its status both with the Liberal Party and in Newfoundland's political scene."
NFL_root_out_corruption:0 "Root Out Corruption Within the Party"
NFL_root_out_corruption_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest contributor to the collapse of subsequent Liberal Governments was the appalling levels of corruption. To keep the current Liberal government intact, a great effort must be made to root out corruption within the Liberal ranks."
NFL_right_hollis_walker_inquiry:0 "Right the Wrongs of the Hollis-Walker Inquiry"
NFL_right_hollis_walker_inquiry_desc:0 "Among the primary reasons for the end of Newfoundlander Democracy was the horrific corruption which plagued every level of the Newfoundland Political Scene - particularly the Liberals. To prevent a second Commission from trampling on the rights of the citizenry, Prime Minister Squires has focused his efforts on eradicating corruption within both the Liberal Party, and the remainder of Newfoundland's government."
NFL_never_another_1932:0 "Never Another 1932"
NFL_never_another_1932_desc:0 "The dark stain which has become irrevocably attached to the Liberal Party has finally begun to fade. The memories of corruption and incompetence have been replaced with the present reality of a Party working tirelessly to improve their conduct. The dark events of 1932 which ended the reign of the Liberal Party shall never be repeated! The Liberals have learned from their past mistakes, and will not rest until the wrongs of the past have been corrected in full."

NFL_confederates:0 "The Confederate Association"
NFL_confederates_desc:0 "The brainchild of one Joey Smallwood, the Confederate Association has been swept into power based on lofty promises of reform and Union with Canada. Rising from the dust that was once the Newfoundland Liberal Party, the new Confederate government promises to avoid the mistakes of the past, and usher in a new era of happiness and prosperity under Canadian oversight."
NFL_overhaul_public_service:0 "Overhauled Public Service"
NFL_overhaul_public_service_desc:0 "Smallwood has often argued that Newfoundland can not afford the present cost of overhead expenses. Arguing that there is no more wasteful system of public administration, or one with so many possibilities for corruption than in Newfoundland. Smallwood has prescribed a special commission of intelligent men to overhaul the entire public service and promote drastic retrenchment and economy. Without this, Newfoundland would continue along the road to financial disaster or Confederation."
NFL_implement_labour_adgenda:0 "Implement the NFL's Agenda"
NFL_implement_labour_adgenda_desc:0 "J.R. Smallwood, as a committed unionist and reformer, has moved along somewhat the same path as Coaker in the late 1920s and early 1930s. Under Smallwood's guide, the policies lobbied for by the Newfoundland Federation of Labour shall be implemented. Policies such as a collective bargaining law, an eight-hour day law, a minimum wage law for women and children, free education, unemployment insurance, and a national health bill, are all measures which would improve the condition of the people, while exerting its influence to prevent strikes."
NFL_ramsay_macdonald_labour:0 "Inspiration from MacDonaldite Labour"
NFL_ramsay_macdonald_labour_desc:0 "Before the tragic events which befell the British isles, Ramsay MacDonald led the Labour party toward 'New Liberalism' and an 'adaption to capitalism', a direction which required purging Communists and Syndicalists members from Party ranks. In Newfoundland, Smallwood shall attempt to follow in MacDonald's footsteps, and create a New Liberalism which will serve both the interests of labour and capital."
NFL_well_paid_employment:0 "Well-Paid Employment"
NFL_well_paid_employment_desc:0 "Individuals such as Coaker and Smallwood have strongly supported a program of industrial development to diversify the Newfoundland economy and provide well-paid employment for our citizens. By moving our economy away from reliance on fisheries, and providing our citizens with good, well-paying jobs, we shall forge forward with economic recovery and pave the way to a richer, happier Newfoundland."
NFL_liberal_coalition:0 "Work with the Liberals"
NFL_liberal_coalition_desc:0 "In the early 1920s Smallwood was nothing more than a Squires 'yes' man and a Liberal Party lackey; later on a Socialist, but now, once more, Smallwood has moved towards the Liberal Party. While Smallwood's movement once aimed exclusively for union with Canada, a new alliance with the Liberal Party has given Prime Minister Smallwood a new platform to go on."
NFL_new_newfie_liberalism:0 "New Liberal Legacy"
NFL_new_newfie_liberalism_desc:0 "While Smallwood has moved to restore the legacy of the Liberal Party, Smallwood has nevertheless criticized the Liberal party for being "intellectually bankrupt' and politics for having "degenerated into... a barefaced tug of war between the Ins and the Outs. As the Confederates move to replace the corrupt and decrepit Liberal Party, Smallwood shall make efforts to try and revitalize the Liberal Movement within Newfoundland and beyond."
NFL_recognize_commission_weakness:0 "Recognize the Weakness of the Commission"
NFL_recognize_commission_weakness_desc:0 "Individuals like Smallwood once saw commission government as an opportunity. However after years of velvet-fisted rule, it has become clear that the Commission's great weakness as a modernizing force was its isolation from and independence of a political constituency which could have provided strong support for its attempts at reform. Without such support it was in no position to challenge any of the basic power blocks in Newfoundland society. That the Commission of Government was a weak administration is made clear by its caution, and acute paranoia toward any forces which might oppose it."
NFL_political_reform:0 "Towards True Political Reform"
NFL_political_reform_desc:0 "Smallwood has long aimed to give labour an effective political voice in the struggle for reform. The NFL's creation was an essential step in this direction. But he also worked to get the Liberal Party to pull itself together... and appear before the country stripped for battle, the banner of social and political reform held high. The time has come for a restatement of the aims, objects and ideals of Liberalism by grappling with Newfoundland's pressing problems. To turn from the problems of the public debt retrenchment, scientific taxation, civil service reform, the fishery, agriculture, labor, education and the railway would be to give our assent to the disaster that is creeping paralysis reaching towards us."
NFL_distance_ourselves_against_radicalism:0 "Distance Ourselves Against Radicalism"
NFL_distance_ourselves_against_radicalism_desc:0 "Ever since the British Revolution, Smallwood has fervently distanced himself from syndicalism, parading his Liberal credentials and arguing for a sane, constitutional, form of Christian socialism. In this respect he did not differ from Ramsay MacDonald, the British Labour Party leader and former Prime Minister whom he much admired, even naming his first son Ramsay in his honour. While to many this is not enough to sever the links to Smallwood and his socialist past, formal distance from the Reds shall aid in our crusade against radicalism of all stripes."
NFL_united_against_syndicalism:0 "United Against Syndicalism"
NFL_united_against_syndicalism_desc:0 "Once the British Revolution arose, Smallwood abandoned his previous socialist positions, taking up the 'War on the Reds' in a radio broadcast with the title 'Why I Oppose Syndicalism'. Ever since, Smallwood has promoted Christian Socialism against communism, syndicalism and conservatism. Taking an anti-war stand and promoting cooperation, Smallwood took advertising and radio as venues for his progressive forces and messaging. Through the pages of the Globe 'God called to the masses' , hoping to drown out the whispered temptations of the 'Reds'. Smallwood's position was that the labour movement should be 'united against Bolshevism, Syndicalism and Communism, its arch-enemy. From the start the Newfoundland Federation of Labor's position was clear: They are strictly constitutional in spirit and letter. We know exactly what our constitutional rights are, and we have studied the British and other constitutions, and have a deeper appreciation of liberty and justice and democracy than our detractors. We shall inflexibly oppose Bolshevism, Syndicalism and force, violence and Revolution. We shall stand for law and order."
NFL_fabian_socialism:0 "Fabian Socialism Without Syndicalism"
NFL_fabian_socialism_desc:0 "Ever since the fall of the United Kingdom to the forces of ravenous Syndicalism, 'Socialism' has become something of a dirty word not just in Newfoundland but throughout the Entente. Despite this, under the guidance and wisdom of Joey Smallwood, Newfoundland has been transformed from a Conservative backwater to a true Liberal Socialist paradise. Under the CA's watch, our socialism shall be a Fabian socialism which recognizes the importance of labour having a political voice, but which puts country before party and class. It shall be a socialism which to a large extent accepts capitalist rationality."

NFL_responsible_government:0 "The Responsible Government League"
NFL_responsible_government_desc:0 "To many, the Responsible Government League is an enigma, a movement defined only by opposition to Canadian annexation. And while this stereotype may have an air of truth to it, in reality, the RGL as a movement extends far beyond efforts to resist Canadian imperialism. A voice for the downtrodden, Catholics, and those who wish to preserve not just Newfoundlander culture but our indisputable nationhood; that is what the RGL is."
NFL_catholic_appeals:0 "Catholic Appeals"
NFL_catholic_appeals_desc:0 "The Catholic population of Newfoundland, mostly centered around the Avalon Peninsula, have long been skeptical of both Canadian accommodation and of British Rule. To help resist the Canadian siren call, and to aid in our efforts to set the RGL apart from the majority Protestant UNP, Prime Minister Cashin shall embark on a campaign to channel Catholic good will into effective political change."
NFL_archbishop:0 "Collaboration with the Archdiocese of St. John's"
NFL_archbishop_desc:0 "The Catholic Clergy stand as one of our most resolute allies in the RGL's struggle against Canadian overlordship, warning their faithful against the perils of the Crown's rule. While we have been rallying Newfoundland's Catholic masses under the banner of the RGL for some time now, solidifying our ties with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John's, Newfoundland, and particularly Archbishop Edward Patrick Roche as a practical bulwark against Confederates and the Orange Order."
NFL_legacy_sir_michael_cashin:0 "Legacy of Sir Michael Cashin"
NFL_legacy_sir_michael_cashin_desc:0 "Prime Minister Peter John Cashin hails from a long line of prominent Newfoundlander businessmen and politicians, most notably his father, Sir Michael Patrick Cashin, who served as Prime Minister of our fair Dominion for six months in the year 1919. His tenure, while undeniably short-lived, established a strong legacy of Social Democracy and Irish Catholic interests that all on our island can take pride in."
NFL_newfoundland_republicanism:0 "Newfoundland Republicanism"
NFL_newfoundland_republicanism_desc:0 "The unprecedented success of the Irish Revolution has inspired hope for freedom among the Irish diaspora across the globe. Here in Newfoundland, Peter John Cashin's RGL has harnessed these feelings to challenge the rule of merchants, Canadian loyalists and the Orange Order. As the Irish population yearns for a 'Newfoundland Sinn Fein', Cashin provides a rousing answer to their cries in the form of the Responsible Government League."
NFL_unify_anti_confederation_groups:0 "A United Anti-Confederation Front"
NFL_unify_anti_confederation_groups_desc:0 "As Newfoundlanders realize the gravity of their betrayal by the forces of London and Ottawa, a great many have taken to expressing their discontent by supporting the RGL. Indeed, citizens of all stripes have been taken in by Cashin's rhetoric, and have hitched their wagon with the growing anti-Confederation movement within our fair island. Be them Syndicalists or Reactionaries, Liberals or Conservatives, Cashin has appealed to them all. To this end, it seems that ideology is not a factor of contention for Cashin's supporters so long as they share his dream of a Free and Independent Newfoundland."
NFL_independent_house_of_assembly:0 "An Independent House of Assembly"
NFL_independent_house_of_assembly_desc:0 "As the RGL solidifies itself in the hearts and minds of our country folk, the time has come to demand an independent legislature free from the trappings of British and Canadian domination. Little by little we shall whittle away the legacy of London's dominion, soon bridging the ground between our dreams of a free Terra Nova, and our current bitter reality."
NFL_tight_budget:0 "A Tight Budget"
NFL_tight_budget_desc:0 "Cashin stands out compared to many men of the same stripes due to his strict fiscal Conservatism and concern for overspending. Unlike previous Liberal and Progressive governments who spend like drunken sailors on George Street, Cashin has committed the RGL to a strict program of fiscal austerity which will hopefully prevent Newfoundland from falling into the trappings of a second Commission."
NFL_hands_off_economics:0 "Financial Self-Sufficiency"
NFL_hands_off_economics_desc:0 "It is clear that the first step towards freeing Newfoundland from British and Canadian dominion is to establish our strict financial independence. Keeping St. John's from being reliant on Canadian loans is essential to maintaining our insolvency, and maintaining government control of vital resources will provide our government with some much-needed liquid cash."
NFL_denounce_commission_autocracy:0 "Condemn the Autocratic Commission"
NFL_denounce_commission_autocracy_desc:0 "It has become clear to all who have lived through the era of Crown rule that the Commission and their ilk were the greatest evil ever brought upon our new found land. As democracy ended, a tear was shed by every true Newfoundland patriot who cursed their leaders for buying into the Canuck's song and dance. Their false promises of a better Newfoundland are perhaps the greatest reason why we can never again allow ourselves to fall under the Canadian spell."
NFL_stamp_out_corruption:0 "Stamping Out Corruption"
NFL_stamp_out_corruption_desc:0 "While once a staunch loyalist of Squires' Liberal Cause, the appalling corruption revealed to him has caused a permanent break between Cashin and the Liberal Party. Additionally, as a primary driver behind the imposition of Commission government, Cashin has a vested interest in keeping Newfoundland free from the machinations of greed and dirty political tricks. No longer shall the merchants be able to simply buy the public will."
NFL_newfoundland_independence:0 "We, Ourselves"
NFL_newfoundland_independence_desc:0 "'Sinn Féin Amháin', We Alone, We Ourselves. In Irish, this slogan has defined their nationhood, their struggle for independence, and indeed their very identity as a nation. While the Irish stand victorious in their struggle for independence, here in Newfoundland we still languish under the yoke of tyrants, awaiting our day, our moment for freedom. Yet the day draws nearer, as a newfound confidence that our fair Terra Nova can hereafter relish in an opportunity for true freedom. Newfoundland, long a province, shall be a nation once again."

NFL_fate_of_newfoundland:0 "The Future of Newfoundland"
NFL_fate_of_newfoundland_desc:0 "Newfoundland has once more played her part in fighting for crown and country, and following the victory that resulted in our King returning home, our own future is less than certain. Do our loyalties lie once more in the crown in London, or has the previous decade under Ottawa’s fold shaped our outlook more than we would like to admit?"

NFL_future_with_canada:0 "Our Future with Canada"
NFL_future_with_canada_desc:0 "The years of direct suffering and stagnation under our own self-determined government has affected the psyche of Newfoundlanders that has proven hard to shake off. The success of the Canadian backed Commission and Joey Smallwood’s image has meant the citizenry feels a deeper connection to Canada and its stabilizing hand than distant London or even our own politicians."
NFL_meet_with_ottawa:0 "Meetings in Ottawa"
NFL_meet_with_ottawa_desc:0 "Newfoundland representatives have begun traveling to Ottawa in conferences and meetings with Canadian leaders to discuss what future cooperation and integration could mean.

NFL_autonomy_within_canada_desc:0 "Whilst we seek greater partnership and brotherhood with Canada -as they are the most practical providers to our isolated islet-, we are looking towards the option of keeping self-government for Newfoundland. If we succeed in this endeavor, it would mean quite a unique status of our country, potentially meaning we could keep our dominionship under a country itself previously a dominion!"
NFL_full_provincehood:0 "Push for Full Provincehood"
NFL_full_provincehood_desc:0 "It has become quite clear that if we seek partnership with the Canadian government, they expect full integration into the federal system they have established. A sizable portion of our own government supports this, with the Governor-General directly supporting this while Smallwood’s Confederate Association is accepting of the proposal, these political forces may direct us into becoming the next Canadian Province."
NFL_gather_support_for_confederation:0 "Drum Up Support for Confederation"
NFL_gather_support_for_confederation_desc:0 "The apathy or even distrust that has been leveraged towards the Canadians by some elements of Newfoundland political society has been a detriment towards any future cooperation between governments. We must rally the people towards this goal using the local camps of the CA and the Governor-General’s word."
NFL_the_confederate:0 "The Confederate"
NFL_the_confederate_desc:0 "Joey Smallwood has been one of the leading forces towards Confederation with Canada, not just being the leader of the newly founded Confederate Association, but also using his radio personality to whip up support amongst the rural population for Confederation. After all, why should we not have the same prosperity as those on the mainland?"
NFL_move_away_from_britain:0 "Breaking Away from Britain"
NFL_move_away_from_britain_desc:0 "While we were originally honored with the status as the first Dominion of the Empire, we quickly realized that our status meant nothing in terms of actual care or support from London. Oftentimes our islet was ignored in any negative situation, and Britain’s apathy towards us has not been forgotten today."
NFL_hash_out_terms_of_union:0 "Hashing Out the Terms of Union"
NFL_hash_out_terms_of_union_desc:0 "The final talks in the negotiations with Canada are being held, with the need to set in stone our terms and agreements with each other before the Union is certified.

NFL_economic_relations_with_canada_desc:0 "Whatever our status with Canada shall be, it is of utmost importance that we have a positive trade relation with Ottawa.

NFL_join_confederation:0 "Confederation Ratified!"
NFL_join_confederation_desc:0 "Today rejoice is resounding throughout Newfoundland as we can finally join in with our Canadian brothers in Confederation. Confederates who long pushed for this outcome, especially their stronghold in Bonavista, are now uncorking the screws on bottles long held in reserve."

NFL_independent_future:0 "A Future of Our Own"
NFL_independent_future_desc:0 "Long has Newfoundland been neglected by our own so-called ‘benefactors’ in a parasitic relationship. It seems this has been kept in memory of many a Newfoundlander, as a self-responsible government has been voted in favor for, and now only our native populace may steer our ship’s future."
NFL_declare_republic:0 "Declare the Republic"
NFL_declare_republic_desc:0 "In order to secure Newfoundland’s fate and destiny as its own vessel in the International world, we must seek our own path.

NFL_proud_to_be_an_islander:0 "Proud to Be an Islander!"
NFL_proud_to_be_an_islander_desc:0 "While some proud men have been able to lead Newfoundland down the road of self determination once more, it was nearly smothered in the crib by the factor that many Newfoundland citizens simply don’t feel proud about their country anymore. This must be reversed for our country to prosper in any respect."
NFL_expose_canadian_conspiracy:0 "Expose the Canadian Conspiracy"
NFL_expose_canadian_conspiracy_desc:0 "After the victory of those championing Self-Responsible Government, we have gained more insights into the backrooms of the fairly reclusive Newfoundland Government under prior administrations and the Commission. Our discoveries of a plot by the Governor-General and Canadian administrators to sway our country into Confederation will remove all credibility those supporting that idea once had."
NFL_tarriff_canada:0 "Protect Newfoundlander Products"

NFL_pragmatic_relations_with_canada_desc:0 "While we may grind our teeth at any Canadian influence lingering over our isle, we also cannot reasonably hope to remain completely alone in the wide and competitive markets of the world with our limited base.

### Events ###

newfoundland.1.t:0 "The First Dominion"
newfoundland.1.d:0 "During their social gatherings in Ottawa, the Exiles fondly reminisce about the complex history of the Anglo presence in Canada, particularly in Newfoundland. Their nostalgia for the empire that slipped from their grasp a decade earlier is evident as they reflect on how the foundation of that empire was laid with the acquisition of Newfoundland. Although Jamestown's settlement in Virginia predates Newfoundland's significance, England's earliest settlements in the New World were indeed established within Newfoundland, notably Cuper's Cove. Over the following centuries, the region witnessed a tumultuous history marked by colonial conflicts between native tribes and the French, leading to attempts to eradicate the entire colony. However, in 1825, Newfoundland became a Crown colony under British control, initiating the next chapter in its development. Subsequently, the colony drafted a constitution, appointed its first governor, and achieved self-governing status in 1854, with Philip Francis Little as its inaugural premier. A significant milestone occurred in 1907 when Newfoundland attained Dominion status within the empire, coinciding conveniently with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. This change marked an increase in level of autonomy for the island, further shaping its small role in the larger British Empire. The bitter failures of the Great War were felt strongly in Newfoundland, whose own intense contributions were ultimately in vain. The British Revolution further shook Newfoundland, as the Liberal/FUP Government of Richard Squires and William Coaker was smeared by opponents accusing them of following the same thread of Syndicalism present in the Union of Britain. While the Union presence was strong in Newfoundland, ideas such as Syndicalism failed to spread into the isolated and socially conservative fishing communities that comprised a majority of their base.\n Formally the last part of the British Empire, jurisdiction of Newfoundland was formally transferred to Canada in 1926, an act which infuriated those who were less than trusting to their Canadian neighbors. The 'usurpation' of duties by Canada has been often a point of contention, with many such as Peter John Cashin desiring 'radical' solutions to free Newfoundland from Canadian influence.\n While we have adjusted to Canadian rule in many ways, Newfoundland's fragile economy and political scene have often put our democratic institutions to the test, with the smouldering anti-democratic sentiment bursting into flame after the unsavoury and corrupt practices of the Squires government were revealed to the general public. This incident would almost mean the death of Responsible Government in Newfound; fortunately due to Canadian mediation and a snap election being held, Newfoundlander Democracy was salvaged. For now at least, it appears that the status quo is safe, however any radical change in our already uneasy situation may prove disastrous, and could very well spell the end of the Dominion as we know it..."
newfoundland.1.a:0 "Quaerite prime regnum Dei."

newfoundland.2.t:0 "Death of King George V"
newfoundland.2.d:0 "Newfoundland awoke this morning to the somber news that King George V had passed away shortly before midnight yesterday. The king had been suffering from ill health for some time and his death was not unexpected, having shirked away from the public some time ago. His death marked the end of an era and the beginning of another one, with his son, Edward VIII, who stands ready to ascend to the throne. The nation was struck by a profound sense of loss as they realized there was no longer a King to lead them. In contrast to the Ottawa government, which is heavily influenced by the Exiles, Newfoundland possesses an intimate connection with the Exiles and London that dates back to before the revolution. Having achieved Dominion status in 1907, Newfoundlanders felt a deep bond with the monarchy and the United Kingdom. Even during the tumultuous Weltkrieg, the nation proudly raised its own infantry regiment to fight for the King and defend shared values. As Prince Edward prepares to take the throne, Newfoundlanders reflect on their history, proud of their Dominion status. While the Exiles might not have been as strong here, Newfoundlanders cherish their enduring connection to the King in Ottawa, and mourn his passing. With Prince Edward's succession, there is hope that this bond will continue to foster a sense of unity and loyalty to the Crown."

newfoundland.3.d:0 "The Berlin Stock Exchange failure has triggered a catastrophic chain of events on an unprecedented scale, leading to what is now known as Black Monday. Panic has swept across the globe, prompting investors to withdraw savings from banks and funds from the stock market. While we initially thought we might be shielded from the immediate impact due to our distance from the German sphere, the repercussions of the crash soon reached our shores as the global economy crumbled. Black Monday has dealt a devastating blow to the already struggling economies of Canada and the United States, both still reeling from the effects of their Great Depressions. Newfoundland, already facing financial challenges from the completion of a railroad across the Dominion in the 1890s and the costs incurred during the raising of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment in the Weltkrieg, has been hit particularly hard. Several of our banks have collapsed, leaving people in financial disarray, unable to access their savings and struggling to afford the necessities of life. Newfoundland's situation is dire, and immediate action must be taken to prevent complete chaos. The impact of the economic downturn is felt throughout our nation, and our citizens face significant hardship. Only through decisive and effective action can we hope to navigate these turbulent times and pave the way towards a brighter future for Newfoundland."

The state of the economy is dire, and it has become painfully evident that the current government is no longer capable of functioning effectively. In light of these circumstances, there are two potential courses of action to consider: the establishment of a Canadian Commission or seeking annexation by Canada. The pressing financial crisis has rendered our government virtually powerless to address mounting challenges. Implementing a Commission of Government could provide a temporary solution by appointing a group of experts to take control and manage the affairs of the Dominion. This is until our financial stability is restored and our economic woes are no more. This option, though it may help us navigate through the immediate crisis, raises concerns about our autonomy and decision-making. On the other hand, seeking annexation from Canada is another option that has been considered. Joining Canada could offer us access to abundant resources, stability, and a stronger economic framework to aid us in our recovery. However, this path also raises questions about our identity as a distinct entity and the potential loss of our own autonomy."

newfoundland.4.b:0 "Formally ask Canada for annexation!"

newfoundland.5.t:0 "Newfoundland Requests Annexation"
newfoundland.5.d:0 "In a historic and solemn moment, Newfoundland's people and government have requested annexation from Canada. Facing an unprecedented financial crisis that has left our coffers empty and the economy in dire straits, the decision to seek annexation was not taken lightly. With the Canadian Commission unable to provide the necessary solutions to our financial instability, the people of Newfoundland have come to recognize that joining Canada offers a lifeline and a path towards stability and prosperity for their futures. Under Ottawa's guidance, Newfoundland will hopefully grow prosperous under this annexation request."
newfoundland.5.a:0 "We can not afford their burden."
newfoundland.5.b:0 "Absorb Newfoundland into Canada!"

newfoundland.6.t:0 "Canada Refuses Annexation"
newfoundland.6.d:0 "In response to Newfoundland's earnest annexation request, Canada respectfully declined the proposal. While acknowledging Newfoundland's financial challenges, Canada believes that annexation is not the appropriate solution for either party involved. Annexation is a complex and far-reaching issue that demands careful consideration of preexisting issues and concerns. The Ottawa government is currently preoccupied with addressing its own financial woes, and integrating Newfoundland would strain its resources and hinder its recovery efforts. What was originally a series of unfortunate events has become a nightmare. This is as we scramble to prevent its collapse, with our options limited to declaring bankruptcy or suspending the democratic government. The situation is indeed dire, and the future appears grim for Newfoundland."

newfoundland.7.d:0 "The past year has witnessed sombering event after sombering event as Newfoundland mourns the passing of its esteemed Prime Minister, Frederick C. Alderdice. Under his guidance, Newfoundland made considerable strides in alleviating the existing financial burdens and economic depression caused by Black Monday. His sudden demise has left a void in the political landscape, one which has been filled by his cousin, former Prime Minister Walter Stanley Monroe. As the successor to the now-defunct United Newfoundland Party, Monroe has come out of retirement to lead the remains of Newfoundland's fractured Conservative movement when and if Newfoundland returns to Democracy.\n\n Newfoundlanders remember his tireless efforts to keep the democratic system intact while grappling with severe economic challenges. In the wake of his passing, while the government remains resolute in its pursuit of financial stability, many feel uneasy as to whether or not Newfoundland has a future ahead at all."

Today, we mourn the passing of Governor-General David Murray Anderson, whose noble service to the nation has ended. Having assumed the role of His Majesty's Representative, Governor-General Anderson faced a tumultuous time in the Dominion of Newfoundland. 1936 has been unrelenting, leaving the nation grappling with financial instability and hardship. Governor-General Anderson's dedication to his duties was unparalleled, even in severe sickness. He remained resolute and committed to serving Newfoundland's people during this critical period. His loss is deeply felt by the entire nation, as he leaves behind a legacy of selflessness and devotion to duty."

newfoundland.9.t:0 "Free Elections to Be Held"
newfoundland.9.d:0 "In what appears to be the beginning of the end of our woes, the Ottawa government has taken a significant step by granting the Royal Commission, responsible for overseeing Newfoundland's affairs, the authority to reinstate our autonomy and democracy ahead of schedule. With this positive development, Newfoundland can now steer its own course and take charge of its destiny. The return of our autonomy is a testament to our people's resilience and determination, who have worked tirelessly to overcome financial hardships and economic challenges that once burdened us. It is crucial for us to maintain a stable and prosperous economy to ensure this newfound independence. Any setbacks could lead to the commission's reinstatement."

Despite their near-decimation in the 1932 Elections, Richard Squires has returned as leader of the Party and seeks to undo his own failures and the failures of the party. However as the election campaign kicks off, the question of the Liberal Party's stances have once more come up. Squires, ever the champion of the 'Old Order' has stated his willingness to continue the 'Old Alliance' between the Liberals and the FPU, which has been in decline in recent years. To the FPU, cooperation with the Liberals seems to be the best way to score some much-needed influence in the House of Assembly, as they currently hold next to no influence after nearly a decade of collapsing poll numbers. Despite this, the relationship between the Liberal Party and the FPU is shaky, as the party has grown tired of the constant corruption scandals of previous Liberal Governments. Additionally, another point of contention between the Liberals and the FPU lies with Coaker's support for the ushering in of the Commission of Government, in contrast to Squires' vehement opposition. If the FPU rejects cooperation, another way forward for the party would be to appeal to 'Confederates' within the party. These 'Confederates', led by Joey Smallwood, have also used popular discontent with the Liberal Party's corruption as a leverage to further advance their agenda within Newfoundland's Liberal Political Scene.\n\n The only variable that remains for Squires is if the FPU can stomach the creation of a new 'Old Alliance', or if Squires will have to strengthen the resolve in the Liberal ranks instead."

newfoundland.12.t:0 "Smallwood Breaks Ranks"
newfoundland.12.d:0 "With Newfoundland returning to a state of 'Responsible Government', the remains of Newfoundland's old political scene have returned to their former positions. Despite a vast period of hiatus from the Democratic System, the Newfoundland Political scene as it is known pre-Commission has survived in a readily recognizable form. Despite this, new movements like the 'Confederate Association' of one Joey Smallwood, a would-be Socialist turned Liberal turned rabid supporter of Confederation with Canada, have made themselves known. Despite detractors labeling Smallwood's movement as a 'Single-Issue Party', Smallwood himself has many of his own policies to bring to the table. As the founder of the Newfoundland Federation of Labour, Smallwood's left-leaning agenda has appealed to Newfoundland's lower-class voters; a demographic which the Liberal Party will have to fiercely compete for. This has contributed to a smear campaign directed by Right-Wing and Merchant friendly groups, who point to Smallwood's Socialist past as evidence of a sinister Syndicalist plot against the Dominion of Newfoundland. While these accusations hold little water, the spectacle whipped up by these groups has inspired a sense of apathy in some of Smallwood's voters."

newfoundland.14.t:0 "The Responsible Government League Forms"
newfoundland.14.d:0 "At the forefront of the burgeoning Anti-Confederation movement stands the Responsible Government League of Peter John Cashin. Labeled as a 'Single-Issue' movement by detractors and disloyal pro-Canadian compradors, Cashin has taken this label with strides, stating that the economic influence of Canada was the greatest threat to Newfoundland that existed today. While their stances on hot button economic and social issues are a seemingly unknown matter, the RGL has taken influences from Sinn Fein as a movement predominantly composed of Irish Catholics which seeks independence from Anglo-Saxon dominance. The ideological positions of the party's frontrunner are even more unclear, as while he was a MHA for the Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party, he later crossed the floor to the Liberals, again crossing the floor to sit as an independent when the Liberal Corruption scandals were revealed. Ever since, Cashin has been a staunch proponent of careful fiscal policy and financial independence, a stance which has often seen him labeled as a Conservative. Additionally, Cashin is the son of the renowned Progressive and Labour politician, Sir Michael Cashin.\n\n Regardless of the ideological positions held by Cashin, the main commitment of the Responsible Government League is one of independence from both the influences of London and Ottawa. Even if support for wholesale Newfoundland Independence is negligible both at home and abroad, Cashin is determined to protect Newfoundland's hard working citizens from the clutches of foreign governments, no matter the cost."
newfoundland.14.a:0 "... And what do they stand for again?"

newfoundland.15.t:0 "The Amulree Report"
newfoundland.15.d:0 "The Newfoundland Royal Commission has released its own findings, drawing parallels with the efforts of the West Indian Royal Commission, headed by Sir Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne. The comprehensive report, known as the Amulree Report, delves into intricate details, explaining how Newfoundland's political culture exacerbated its economic instability. The findings shed light on crucial aspects of Newfoundland's governance and economy. Newfoundland's mercantile elite never fully embraced the democratic government's potential, the report reveals. They regarded the system as expensive, cumbersome, and inefficient, leading them to grant power carelessly to individuals lacking education and experience. This fostered a culture of corruption and patronage, as mercenary politicians vied to secure votes. The political system, unfortunately, is built on widespread corruption, undermining responsible government. Moreover, the Amulree Report exposes deep sectarian rivalries within the country's government, which adds to the government's challenges. As the financial crises deepened in the 1930s, certain merchants and their allies grew increasingly anxious about their own finances. Fearing bankruptcy and debt defaults, they entertained the idea of suspending the constitution and entrusting the country's affairs to a "commission" to safeguard their wealth. For them, sacrificing a responsible government seemed like a small price to pay for financial stability. Regrettably, many Newfoundlanders sympathized with this sentiment, due to government and corruption scandals in the 1920s. Administrations were short-lived, plagued by defections and shifting alliances. The nation found itself in political turmoil, hindering progress and development. In addition to political issues, the Amulree Report also highlights the economy's complexity and its susceptibility to external factors. Global events, such as the Weltkrieg, affected Newfoundland's financial stability. While the construction of the Newfoundland Railway was initially seen as a step towards progress, it eventually became a heavy financial burden that the nation struggled to bear. The Amulree Report's revelations serve as a sobering reminder of Newfoundland's challenges. Addressing political corruption and fostering responsible governance will be crucial for the nation's path towards economic stability and prosperity."

newfoundland.16.d:0 "It appears that due to severe financial issues and near bankruptcy, Newfoundland has put Labrador up for sale. Geographically, it is one of the easternmost provinces on continental Canada and is roughly triangular in shape. Labrador borders Quebec and hosts abundant mineral resources, although it primarily consists of thin soil. Labrador's sale is expected to bring in much needed funds to pay off Newfoundland's debt. It has a population of just a couple of thousand people and is home to a handful of small, rural towns. In the recent past, the provincial government has looked to develop Labrador's natural resources, including petroleum and rare earth minerals. However, the sale of this territory has been met with much opposition from indigenous tribes who claim that the land is their ancestral home and should not be sold off to be exploited."

This momentous achievement was the result of a united effort, although it came at a high cost. The lives lost in this endeavor will forever be remembered for their selfless sacrifice. Though the tide has turned in our favor, we must acknowledge that the path to restoring Britain to its former glory is challenging and lengthy. We cannot be certain if we will ever return to the days of yore. For now, Newfoundland is still under Canadian authority. This interim phase is crucial for establishing stability and rebuilding Britain to its former glory. It is vital that we work hand in hand with the Ottawa government to ensure a smooth transition to self-government and pave the way for a brighter future. Together, we shall strive to restore Newfoundland to its former glory and ensure that we are never compelled to relinquish our sovereignty."

In the Newfoundland National Convention, constitutional options will be debated and recommendations for a national referendum will be made. This referendum will include our right to responsible government and self-determination, which are crucial for shaping our destiny. During these discussions, some delegates expressed their sympathies with the Ottawa government and proposed integrating into Canada as one of its provinces. Although these individuals represent a minority, their ideas have reached the public through various media channels. They have elaborated on the potential economic and political benefits of such a union. Amidst these varying perspectives, the delegates have largely agreed upon three options: a return to Dominion status, maintaining the current Commission of Government arrangement (status quo), or pursuing Confederation with Canada. These choices will be presented to the people in a national referendum, Newfoundland's fate determined by the people's will. In the event that no definite winner is determined in the first referendum, the two options with the highest percentage of votes will proceed to a second referendum, giving the people another opportunity to make their voices heard and shape Newfoundland's future."

There were previous worries that the coming referendum would not draw much attention or care at all from the populace, who have not seen democratic systems of voting in a while. However, these fears have been dashed on this occasion with the sheer turnout being staggering in person, with the Newfoundland Ranger Force reporting nearly 88% of the eligible voting population being present for the referendum. The anticipation is palpable in the air, with the political divisions that were drawn specifically for this referendum having a large role to play, as the political organizations of the Confederate Association and the Responsible Government League made sure to whip up quite the fervor for their favored vote. This polarized environment has thankfully not resulted in any violence or escalations, both before or during election day as it has mainly been fought on the front of political cartoons, with the only notable exception being when Joey Smallwood was chased away from St John’s by a mob. Now,the final numbers for the larger than expected vote are filtering in, and we can finally get an idea of what the results are!"

None of the results gained over 50% of the vote, and thus none were decisively declared the winner. This has certainly resulted in pent up tension, none more so than the sectarian divide between the Catholic RGL and the Protestant CA, who are both lashing out against their results by mobilizing their own respective parties for the scheduled second referendum, whilst still fuelling the divides between Newfoundland’s religious and even rural and urban communities against each other, all in the hope of inching out the other party in the vote. Indeed, even the Governor-General has unusually broken his own impartiality and voiced his opinion in the pulpit of George Street United Church, stating publicly that ‘Last time the Roman Catholics had their say, this time it’s our!’ referring to his own protestant sect and the wider Commission’s favor towards the Confederates goals. While the Newfoundland Rangers have been placed on high alert for any political violence from erupting in the nation, particularly the Avalon Peninsula, the violence is unlikely to boil over in the time before the next referendum."

This has been quite pleasing news to the Orange Lodge, who had campaigned heavily in favor of Confederation after the Catholic bishops supported self-government. The Smallwood campaign has celebrated, as the experience and even sway Smallwood had previously gained with his time over in the Liberal party has resulted in him having the organizational skills to establish the Confederate’s campaigning machine, which resulted in him crossing the electoral finish line with a sizable gap over his opponent. Already Smallwood, after enjoying the celebrations themselves, has set about the task of furthering the agenda of completing Confederation with the Canadians, alongside the correlating negotiations, and even paving the road towards a potential future premiership in the Canadian system."

This young and relatively haphazardly formed organization has begun the process of taking over government offices and while it seems there is some clunkiness to the handover process due to new circumstances and new politicians not familiar with the ropes, it seems that the RGL as a whole has taken to their granted mandate with a passion."

The organized platforms of the RGL and the CA have both been outdone by what was a disorganized but widespread show of support for an extension of the Commission of Government. It appears that the Newfoundlander feeling of apathy towards self government continues much to the loathing of the Catholics, and yet they have rejected Canadian oversight to a return of their status in the Colonial Office in London. In a shocking vote that has reaffirmed Newfoundland’s loyalty to Britain, it appears the first Dominion returns to the fold."

So now within the internal workings of the Newfoundland Government, particularly in the office of the Governor-General, there are questions arising for if Admiral Walwyn should remain in his current capacity as Governor, or rather step down and allow a successor to take the position. Admiral Walwyn’s tenure as Governor-General has been quite successful, taking an active stance in battling the economic hardships that his predecessor had not, and yet some still view that his time as governor has naturally come to a close. Indeed, the British Colonial Office has begun preparing the appointment of someone new to hand the reins off to, with Gordon Macdonald, a Welshman who was brought into the Exiles parliament and has experience in the coal and energy fields, being floated around as a name. However, there also has been heavy lobbying for a more native candidate as Newfoundland’s Governor, and if we were to pick a native Newfoundlander, the one who would make the most sense would be Leonard Outerbridge. A military veteran who has made his name since by serving in numerous political positions, before serving as the director of civil defense, and supported heavily by the merchants of the nation, Outerbridge is a popular name at home. So, the Colonial Office must make a decision regarding the future holder of the title of Governor-General."

While their influence has previously been kept in check by Cashin, our increasing reliance on the Yanks has made Crosbie's takeover something of an inevitability.

Diving headlong into ambitious projects that they had no budget for, while not keeping a lid on the boiling pot that was their leftover debt, the Newfoundland populace once more felt the financial burdens all too familiar to them placed on their backs yet again by a callous government. Ottawa has sent an immediate request back to the former members of the first Commission, many of whom had just returned to their homestead’s when the call to return to blasted St John’s arrived. These Commission members, alongside the Governor-General have yet again arrived and taken charge in a timely manner, as the population was surging towards a sequel to the Riot of ‘32 in their dread of the state of the country.

Now the political parties hastily prepare for a very quick campaigning season against one another, while getting their own candidates selected, from a fresh stock of many eager new prospects for earning a spot in the sessions of a self-governing parliament. Some of these parties had been prepared by being present in the native advisory committee to the Commission, while others dust off party signs from sheds that were host to party organizer meetings during the suspension of democracy.

Our time spent listening to orders and seeking financial aid from Ottawa has meant that now the Empire’s seat is restored in London, our Dominion is strung between the influences of Canada, and our duties to London. It would be a very simple deal to raise up the United Kingdom’s flag once more and align our Dominion with the London Colonial Office, as our legitimate claim as a Dominion of the empire would put us under the King’s Purview. But this would be a slap in the face to the Canadians, whom we have wracked up quite a debt to during our economic troubles, and so those politicians who feel indebted towards the Canadians, particularly those representatives of the Confederate Association who have stated our gained ties and fraternity with our fellow country, have proposed that perhaps the Dominion can stay under the now independent Canadian sphere, something that would be a first for both Canada and Newfoundland. There is also a radical third position that is being propped up by those who had argued against Canadian Confederation and are wishing that with the end of the war and liberation of Britain, Newfoundland can become its own ship in the sea of independent nations. This outspoken minority is trying to gain influence among the populace and steer them towards the establishment of a Republic of Newfoundland, due to the unique identity we have always felt that separated us from the Canadians in the first place. With these positions being argued for and solidifying their own supporter’s lines, a vote in the assembly shall be organized for our Dominion's future course."

newfoundland.40.t:0 "The Fate of Labrador"
newfoundland.40.d:0 "There have been many unsolved questions that have arisen following the independence of our new republic, most often surrounding trade and foreign policy. However, one newly arising issue is growing close to home, and that is the status of our often overlooked partner on the continent, Labrador. Labrador, which holds only 6 percent of our nation’s population, is under our government’s purview and representation, but is often left to its own devices in management of the few and far between settlements. This neglect on part of our government in the Dominion days has meant that Labrador was fiercely against self-responsible government, and had championed for confederation instead. This increasing political divide with our partnered region is growing with its continued limbo even in our newly established republic, and as such a need to do something is becoming apparent.\n\nOne proposed idea has been brought -or rather revived- in the Newfoundland government and that is to sell Labrador for profit to Canada. Even despite our contentious relationship with Ottawa, many see it as a perfectly fine choice to give the continental landmass over to Canada which had previously pursued the claim over it as part of Quebec, in exchange for a much needed monetary boost. There is the possibility that we could release the increasingly upset Labradorians as their own nation, giving them self-government while snubbing Ottawa and maintaining friendly relations.\n\nThose two options are of course if we wish to give up Labrador as part of our country. While most of our focus is concentrated on Newfoundland’s affairs, not many are willing to abandon our fellow countrymen. The most well looked upon decision would be to accede to the petitions and demands for further representation of Labrador within our republic, giving them 3 seats in our house of representatives and further accepting our neighboring region into the fold. However, there are a select few who are unwilling to give up the land that we have invested funds into, with the military bases in Goose Bay coming to mind, but also view that the fairly empty landmass should not take up a wider role in affairs when attention is most needed at home. This minority who mainly worked in the administration of the Dominion yet have stayed in past independence view the single advisor that has represented Labrador in council as enough. While it is a relatively small amount of population spread out across varying outports not too dissimilar to that of rural Newfoundland, this decision on Labrador's autonomy will affect the landmass that has been so commonly seen as our partner."

newfoundland.41.d:0 "Newfoundland has been steadily recovering from the Great Depression, however it increasingly is becoming aware to the government that besides just affecting the economy, the depression provided a heavy hit to the psyche of many Newfie citizens. The United Newfoundland Party, already having been the most ardent supporters of a tight and responsible budget under the Commission, are not taking kindly to what is being perceived as abuse of the welfare system. Therefore a two pronged government initiative is being launched to combat such behaviour, one in the educational field to revive the self-confidence of the people in their own self-sufficiency, and the other in the justice system as both the courts and Law Enforcement will crack down on abusers.\n\nThe education departments have begun teaching various adult courses which should combat dependent behaviour, while encouraging independent ventures to flourish once more. Ranging from financial and culinary classes, to even business and farming courses in what is being called a ‘Back to the Land’ campaign that encourages rural living and homesteading. Meanwhile, the constabularies have begun investigatory work into circumstances of each welfare beneficiary, with fines and suspensions of benefits being given to those no longer in need of government assistance, while particularly egregious offenders have even been sent to trial in the courts, facing prison sentences. The threat of legal action will hang over any potential welfare abuser, as besides checks by the benefits office into the usage of allotments, government sponsored advertisements and announcements are becoming commonplace on streets and the radio waves, warning of the heavy handed consequences. Besides government action, the more independent minded creed is being taken up by the upper class of our nation, as philanthropist actions are being encouraged and given good light for their uplifting model, while even the urban center of St John’s has felt the pull of self-sufficiency, with architects plotting out new rooftop gardens and projects not too uncommon to see in distant New York City."

The Liberals are also no stranger to the controversies of Prime Minister Squires, but a more slow burning one is increasingly gaining alarm among our establishment, as it threatens to rock our very party foundation and chances of future electoral victory. Richard Squires has been an active member of and increasingly a leader within the Orange Order’s branch in Newfoundland, a source of much controversy among our Catholic supporters. Members of our party have already reported receiving letters from their Catholic voters stating concerns at best, and outright threatening to abandon the party in the worst cases. Indeed it appears as if rival parties such as the tories and the catholics in favour of independence are already running attacks on us in the press over Squires sponsorship and expansion of the Orange Order Lodges. It will have to come to a conclusion here with Squires making a decision on which sect to appease, if not both, due to the near half and half sectarian split of Newfoundland’s populace often leading to close cut races in elections."

But whilst the public appearances have made him endeared to the voting bases, those within any position in government have started to notice a trend of harsh political plays and ostracization of those not willing to toe the line. It appears that Smallwood has been exercising his executive powers in a form not common to our nation, as a range of politicians ranging from members of parliament to even lowly town mayors have found out when he would personally threaten them with isolation and removal of benefits if they were not in line with his agenda. It has not ended with political threats either, as in one notable instance when a wood worker’s union formulated a strike in response to Smallwood’s invitation of Canadian private business and even crown corporations, Smallwood exercised his powers to declare the union illegal, and instead strong-armed the workers into a state sponsored one. It appears our leader has not reacted to criticism from the press well either, as when cartoonists and journalists from the Newfoundland Telegram paint his actions as an authoritarian streak, he has filed libel suits against them and threatened the withdrawal of government sponsors. This play has resulted in the media now toeing a neutral view towards the current government cabinet and leadership, and indeed it's a question of if the average citizen is aware of Smallwood’s behaviour in such activities. One thing is for certain however, that many supporters of the Confederate Association do not appear to mind the hard tactics that Smallwood is applying for their benefit."

The predominantly Catholic and working class populations of the urban centers -particularly the Avalon Peninsula which is home to St John’s- have long envied the Protestant merchants and their historic monopolies and guilds, with a century's worth of established history being commonplace in such circles. The RGL have begun pointing out these vast wealth inequalities in order to combat the merchants on more steady foundations and to inflame their stronghold’s less fortunate citizenry into supporting potential government legislation targeting the merchants wealth. No where else has such proposals of monopoly busting or wealth redistribution been taken up more strong than the Church, with Archbishop Edward P. Roche who had been an opponent of Confederation with Canada previously, now engaging in a public charity campaign and citing the merchants lack of goodwill proof of their greed and malign attitude towards the common man. The Protestant coastal strongholds which house these merchant and fishing monopolies have begun branding any attempt of government intervention as religious inspired discrimination."

newfoundland.45.d:0 "The Newfoundland Rangers have provided the rural outports of our great nation with safety and security for more than five years. However the pressing matters of reclamation, combined with continued fears of Syndicalist infiltration and sabotage have made the expansion of the Ranger force a priority for the Commission of Government. Efforts to reform the Ranger Force were already underway by the time the Commission took power, as the Force's headquarters were relocated from the Colonial Building's basement to the town of Whitbourne on the Avalon Peninsula shortly after the suspension of Responsible Government. With their relocation, the former estate of Sir Robert Bond, the Grange, located near Whitbourne became the official training ground for the Ranger Force.\n\nThe Ranger Force, while inspired by the Canadian RCMP, lacks much of the organization and strength held by their Canadian Counterparts, with the force barely clearing 80 members. While getting more men to enlist in the service is a must, the question of how extensive the Rangers' new authority shall be is a matter of some debate. Governor Walwyn has warned Ottawa that the creation of a pseudo-Secret Police here in Newfoundland may not be well received. And while some of our Canadian managers have been understanding of the Governor's concern, others, particularly Exiles, have tossed aside Walwyn's concerns, and have proposed a top-down reorganization of the Ranger Force which would see them take on sweeping new authority."

While we have resisted these calls, even despite incredible hardship, today, it has been announced that Canada and Newfoundland will be consolidated into a single nation under the direct rule of the Crown. The recent merger of the Canadian and Exile governments has given precedent for the consolidation of realms within the Crown, leading Governor Walwyn to officially declare the amalgamation of the Dominion of Newfoundland with the remainder of the United Kingdom; paving the way for Direct Rule of Newfoundland from Ottawa. While some, notably one Peter John Cashin have decried this course of action, we are confident that it is all for the best.

newfoundland.47.d:0 "Newfoundland shared countless similarities to our eastern neighbors. From language to government, sometimes it can be hard to tell our two nations apart. One such commonality that our nations share is a long-standing opposition to conscription. During the first Great War, while our mighty empire was still intact, Newfoundlanders were not forced into conscription during our participation in the war, with Newfoundlander volunteers instead serving in British regiments instead of their own, unlike Dominions such as Australasia and Canada. However now, it seems that the situation in the Empire is much more dire, and with that in mind, Newfoundland's forces are to be wholly independent, and no longer integrated into Canadian divisions. In order to fight the great deal of apathy within our populace due to the tragic events of the Somme and Beaumont-Hamel, conscription has been introduced to keep the flow of manpower steady. As was expected, the introduction of conscription to our fair Isle has many up in arms, even if many will be allowed to stay home to defend our territory due to our status as an easy landing ground for Syndicalist invasion. The Governor, eager to avoid domestic discontent, has asked his Canadian superiors for permission to ease conscription in Newfoundland, even if they already seem intent on squeezing Newfoundland for every man they can get."

Financial projections show that Newfoundland could soon be enjoying full employment, and would in the process be in position to make interest-free loans to the British Exile Government, on whom it had previously relied for financial assistance. In becoming a ‘garrison country’, Newfoundland will leave behind the hard times of the 1930s and enter a new phase in its history. Newfoundlanders, as observed by Governor Sir Humphrey Walwyn were dazzled by Entente dollars, hygiene and efficiency. The exposure to outside dollars and ways of life has contributed much towards the modernization of Newfoundlander building, architecture, communications systems, as well as the art of better and more comfortable living. However this situation is not without its downsides; as some believe that the rising economic tide in Newfoundland may soon herald the end of British rule. While we have understood that wartime prosperity in Newfoundland would make political adjustment unavoidable, many within the Commission hope that our transition to the next state in our nation's history will not come at the price of bloodshed."

newfoundland.49.t:0 "History of St. Pierre and Miquelon Under Newfoundlander Rule"
newfoundland.49.d:0 "Even before the French Revolution, the future of the French colonies were a matter of lively concern to the British Empire. For Newfoundland, our interests were particularly focused on the islands of St. Pierre and Miquelon, situated within a ten miles distance of our shores. A natural concern was manifested in Newfoundland over the effects on Newfoundland and on the war effort of St. Pierre and Miquelon coming under Syndicalist influence. Despite many residents of the island wishing for annexation by the United States over that of Canada or the Dominion of Newfoundland, British forces ultimately moved in to seize the island shortly after the proclamation of the Commune of France. In St. John's, it was recognized that, if any considerations of change in sovereignty arise, Newfoundland's interests would be seriously prejudiced by either Canadian or American jurisdiction over the islands. Indeed, it has long been felt in Newfoundland that the union of St. Pierre and Miquelon to France was a serious error, and one which has cost Newfoundland dearly over the past century. It has been stated that through smuggling and loss of fishing time to Newfoundland crews, they have cost Newfoundland a million dollars a year for the past hundred years. These figures could, of course, not be proved, but the general truth of the assertion of loss to this country is indisputable. St. Pierre and Miquelon have been a thorn in the flesh and their reversion to Newfoundland is desirable and would solve many problems. While the Canadians attempted to get their hands on the island before the British Revolution, London ultimately recognized that if such an event occurred, the blow to Newfoundland would be severe; declaring that the islands could be used, under either Canadian or American control, to prejudice Newfoundland‘s interests irretrievably, and that the opportunities for smuggling would be increased, rather than lessened. While the Canadians have occasionally complained about our control of the islands, in the present year, it seems that the matter of control of these small islands is not a pressing concern of the Exile Government."

As a Crown Colony of the Kingdom of Canada, Newfoundland has automatically joined the war upon its declaration. With a state of war now existing, the Commission has drafted 'An Act for the Defence of Newfoundland', the Newfoundland equivalent of the Canadian War Measures Act, a provision which will hopefully provide adequate response to the present emergency. Men of Newfoundland will soon join their Canadian compatriots in their journey across the great sea, as others back home contribute to the equally important work of protecting Entente territory from Syndicalist invaders.

The Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire who once enthusiastically supported the Commission's creation has now come to realize that the only way to truly secure the future of Organized Labour is to do away with Capitalism entirely. The Canadian Government and the Exiles have both proven themselves to be enemies of the working man, and the only way for the brave Labourers of Newfoundland to be truly free is to cast off the chains imposed on us by Canada and the Exiles. The Canadians themselves are very unlikely to accept any such discussion within Newfoundland, and would be sure to snuff out any hint of Revolution the moment they sense it. With that in mind, planning for the Revolution has moved underground, with both Coaker and Cashin attempting to throw the Newfoundland Rangers off of the scent of Revolution. The Union of Britain has quietly begun funding, organizing and preparing for the right moment. The moment where the Workers of Newfoundland are ready to break their chains and cast out the Wicked Commission and their Canadian accomplices."

Uncovered in the raid were documents linking William Coaker, Peter John Cashin and the FPU to a sinister plot spearheaded by the Union of Britain to cause a Syndicalist uprising among our population. This would-be revolution was shockingly headed by one William Coaker, who while undeniably a dangerous figure, was also a Patriot and Subject of the King whose ultimate loyalties were assumed to lie with the Monarchy. As this Syndicalist plot falls apart, the leaders of this abortive rebellion have been interned for their Anti-Monarchy and Pro-Syndicalist stances.

The destitute men who have toiled for uncaring merchants, and who have been robbed of representation due to once-baseless fears of a Syndicalist uprising have moved to stage a massive protest, not unlike the one in 1932 which brought down the Squires Government, to object to the recent declaration of war against the Union of Britain by the King. In their own words, we can not possibly support a costly and far-off war declared by out of touch aristocrats when Newfoundland and its citizenry have been left severely hurting for funds and employment. The rangers sent to pad down this crowd of unruly workers expected to simply disperse the gathered crowd; and at worst they would be faced with a repeat of 1932’s harrowing events. Instead, to the horror of the police, the crowd of angry fishermen was heavily armed with British-supplied Submachine Guns. The shots that rang through St. John's only ended after the mob of Fishermen broke through the hastily set-up ramparts, and stormed the Colonial Building; beating Governor Walwyn to within an inch of his life with the stocks of their British-provided weaponry as he tried to escape. The few members of the Commission who managed to survive quickly boarded a plane to Canada in an attempt to report the news and call in help.\n While they had assumed that this was just a mere riot which had grown out of control, the FPU’s seizure of the Colonial Building, and Coaker’s declaration of a Newfoundlander Revolution has proven that the seeds of Syndicalist discontent has run far deeper than the Commission has ever predicted..."

The inability of the Newfoundland Rangers to handle the situation was puzzling to the Canadians at first, however as the survivors recounted their stories it became clear that the angry mob was apparently heavily armed. While the source of these arms could easily be written off as old hunting rifles, some eyewitnesses recall that the weapons used were military-grade and resembled those used by our arch-enemy: the Union of Britain. The potential for an uprising in Newfoundland, while mulled over by some more paranoid members of our administration, is a shockingly unlikely scenario.

Offering to lend us their aid in the coming struggles and battles ahead, the Mi’kmaq largely live within Nova Scotia, which currently languishes under the rule of the Royalists and their exiled benefactors, and as such they offer us their support on one condition - help them liberate their kin in Nova Scotia while granting them an equal and just place in this new nation we are creating. Pushing for greater autonomy, equal rights to Whites, the return of some ancestral land, and other similar clauses, their price is not too high to consider the offer, but their hardline anti-European and isolationist stances puts them at odds with our red allies from London.

From his time managing his own ‘Coakerville’ agricultural cooperative and working in a pre-established telegraph workers’ union during his college-years to organizing his own current of the local labor movement through the expansion of Coakerville and his later creation of the Fisherman's Protective Union, the Fishermen's Union Trading Co., and the union town of Port Union itself, as well as his time in the Newfoundland Assembly, Coaker had spent decades of his life trying to better the living standards and ease the plight of the Newfoundland working-class, which he did admirably once finally at the helm of our burgeoning revolution.\n\nAlthough he was able to guide us to victory initially, we must now move forward with ‘Coaker’s Dream’ without him as he is finally laid to rest. In his absence, we must now decide on who among us shall take his place at the forefront of the FPU and our revolution. The three most likely candidates are either Coaker’s oldest ally, the conservative unionist Kenneth McKenzie Brown with ties to Canada’s Progressive Conservatives and to the United Newfoundland Party outside of his normal allies in the FPU, Coaker’s loyal protégé, the progressive welfare state advocate and modernist industrializer Joey Smallwood, or Coaker’s most prominent woman ally, the feminist suffragette, labour advocate, and progressive activist Julia Salter Earle.

nfl_mikmaq.8.d:0 "Back during King William’s War in 1696, which was merely the North American theater for the far more global Nine Years’ War between the empires of France and England, our ancestors within the Wabanaki Confederacy - a pan-Eastern Algonquian confederacy including the Mi’kmaq, Maliseet, Abenaki, Penobscot, and Passamaquoddy - fought alongside the forces of New France, seeing combat across eastern Canada’s coasts while razing over 100 English colonial villages and settlements to the ground and famously serving in the Siege of Pemaquid, with prominent native leaders arising during this conflict like the famed Jean-Vincent d'Abbadie, Baron de Saint-Castin, chief of the Abenaki. Although New France has since fused into wider Canada, and although we now find ourselves aligned with these Anglos in some twist of fate, we shall never forget the legacy of our military prowess and victories. We shall harken back to this legacy as we create a modern Mi’kmaq military centered around veterans within the wider Dawnlands - like our own Peter Jeddore, nephew of our leader Joe and himself a veteran of the Great War, Sam Gloade who became a highly decorated soldier for the Canadian army in the Weltkrieg, and Charles Norman Shay who served with the American military before taking up a position as sacham of the Penobscot - no matter the foes we may now face, for none shall take the Dawnlands from us ever again!"

nfl_mikmaq.9.d:0 "Traditionally, the Santé Mawiómi - or the Mi'kmaq Grand Council - takes the roles of executive, judiciary, and legislature in Mi’kmaq society, aided by the women’s council, the various other sub-councils and local democratic organizations that all bands within our nation employ, and the numerous chiefs and captains that guide these councils, all coalesced into a true expression of plural rule free from despotism and dictators. However, in times of great stress or national importance, a grand sacham or Saqamaw is chosen to represent the will of the whole, as was done in the recent case of Joe Jeddore. However, such a position is usually only ever meant to be temporary, and with the worst behind us, most elders and traditionalists now urge Jeddore to step down. Although happy to retire to his life as a linguist, naturalist, conservationist, guide, and historian, Joe Jeddore has been hesitant to step down after the instance from some worried citizens that him stepping down would weaken our position relative to the Canadians and the wider Entente, whose systems of government are accustomed to investing large swathes of power in a single person. So hectic has this debate grown that Jeddore's first meeting with the main council in Mniku once finally back in Cape Breton went horribly as constant arguments between captains and elders dictated the entire event. With tensions high, Jeddore must make a choice - step down for unity or stay on as Saqamaw to resist the Anglos."

To honor those leaders of these brother-tribes who led our people through the darkness of Anglo occupation, we will make their leading figures official ministers within our government as they continue to guide their councils in accordance with our own, including figures like Chief and ‘Leptanet’ William Saulis of the Maliseet who promotes Catholic syncretism and Maurassianism, Chief William Neptune of the Passamaquoddy who actively works towards the traditionalist revival of our dying culture, Chief Charles Norman Shay of the Penobscot who valiantly served in the American military, Henry Perley aka Chief Henry Red Eagle the famed folk author, conservationist, anti-socialist reformer, and entertainer of the Maine-based Wolastoqiyik Maliseet, and Gabriel Sylliboy of the Cape Breton Mi’kmaq who was the first Grand Chief ever chosen in 1919, and the first modern Mi’kmaq aside the Jeddores to fight for indigenous recognition, hunting rights, and the acceptance of the old treaties our people made with the Canadians centuries ago that should grant us certain inalienable rights. However, many suggest that any of these titans could temporarily serve as grand sachem - or Kji-Saqamaw - as Jeddore did in order to foster greater trust and cooperation between our groups.

nfl_mikmaq.11.d:0 "Since Chief Henri Membertou’s run-in with French Catholic missionary Jacques Cartier in the late 1500s and early 1600s, the Mi’kmaq have been influenced by Christianity for better or for worse, causing a divisive split in our people that has lasted well into the modern age. Still causing issues to this day, Noel Jeddore - brother of our own Joe Jeddore and our Sagamaw before Joe was given the position - was even exiled to the backwoods of Cape Breton in 1923 due to his impassioned speech against the Anglicization of our religion and culture that stated ‘if we stopped speaking Mi’kmaq in the church, there would be murder in our hearts’, and which some misattributed as a call for violence. Later stating ‘One time before we became Christians, the Mi’kmaw were very strong, for not even bullets could hurt us. But when we became Christian, we turned into a very weak people’, Noel represents the most anti-European and anti-Christian among us, while other kin diametrically opposed to these ideas within the Dawnlands like Chief William Saulis of the Maliseet instead push heavily for Catholic-Algonquin syncretism, with Saulis specifically taking inspiration from French thinker Charles Maurass with the help of his Motewolonuwi-Papahtom or Catholic Shamans devoted to Maurassian Integralism. These haunting quotes by Noel Jeddore have sparked controversy yet again, sweeping much of the districts up into this debate between our new faith and our old traditions as some demand full devotion to Catholicism and European languages while others stand for a more syncretic approach that more closely cares for and helps in the revival of our native culture, customs, faith, and language while still being Christian on the surface. And so another debate lands on the Saqamaw’s plate, leaving Joe Jeddore to make another decision that shall affect the People of the Dawn for decades to come."

nfl_mikmaq.17.d:0 "First described by Western eyes in 1675 by the French Roman Catholic missionary Father Le Clercq when he observed Mi’kmaq (Mi’kmaw) children writing marks on birchbark with porcupine quills and then counting said marks to help them memorize their prayers, the Mi’kmaq have an interesting history of pictograph and hieroglyphics usage. Father Le Clercq took what little script he saw and expanded them while officializing their design and organization, creating a full writing system based on what he saw, which then spread to other missionaries and across the Mi’kmaq districts, rising to become the unofficial alphabet for Mi’kmaq language, alongside the similar hieroglyphical rendition of the Mi’kmaq language made in the winter of 1737-1738 by another Catholic missionary named Pierre Maillard. Although there is archeological evidence of pictograph creation before European contact, the research into its prevalence and usage is next to non-existent, either lost to time or not preserved or studied in the first place, at least in Western academic settings, leading to many to believe that Le Clercq and Maillard’s research and linguistic transcriptions were the true origin of this system of writing, and that the Mi’kmaq before their arrival only used the markings mnemonically, which may or may not be true. As such, it is still hotly debated whether or not this writing system existed before European contact, with there being some evidence - or lack of evidence - to support either theory, but that has not stopped the spread of this ‘Suckerfish Script’ as it is called from being used by a decent subset of our population, especially in religious settings as its commonly used to transcribe Catholic prayers from English into our native tongue. Called Gomgwejui'gasit in the traditional Mi’kmaq language that itself is called Mi’kwmawi’sit/Mi’kmawi’simk, the Mi’kmaq hieroglyphic writing system is a strange fusion of European and Indigenous history that mirrors our own syncretic culture, and as such it is the perfect writing system to accompany our language and cultural revival under Jeddore, aided by other Mi'kmaq linguists like David A. Francis and Dr. Peter Lewis Paul. Hopefully within the coming decades, a whole new generation of Mi’kmaq will be able to speak their native tongue while reading and writing in our unique hieroglyphic system as we continue to resist Anglicization wherever we can."

nfl_mikmaq.19.d:0 "The Jeddore family has long been at the center of Mi’kmaq politics and culture, dating all the way back to We’jitu Isidore who was the Kji-Saqamaw of all Mi’kmaq across New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Quebec in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Fast forwarding to the present day, his ancestor Joseph ‘Amité’ Jeddore works alongside his brother, the former Kji-Sagamaw Noel Joseph Jeddore, and his nephew Peter Jeddore in order to keep the family name clean and clear while guiding their fellow Mi’kmaq to a more equal and prosperous life. However, Noel is known for his more radical takes on anti-European issues, being the keeper of a tribal relic - in the form of an old Catholic prayer book watermarked in 1807 that is written in Mi’kmaq hieroglyphics aka the Komqwej wi’kasikl or the Gomgwejui'gasit - and infamous for losing the position as Saqamaw to his brother Joe, the current holder of the title, after impassioned outbursts against the erosion of our culture and language at the hands of the former administration and their lackey Father Stanislaus St. Croix.\n\nSt. Croix himself arrived in the Dawnlands in 1916 and rapidly became an enemy of the Jeddores by purposefully driving a wedge between the most pro-Catholic among us and those like the Jeddores still fighting for our own unique culture and identity, all despite the Mi’kmaq living as model citizens peacefully and productively for ages. Previously banning the Mi’kmaq language in churches and schools, promoting interracial marriages to whitewash our ethnic roots, and aiding in the passing of legislation that perpetually kept the Mi’kmaq and other First Nations peoples in generational poverty, the damage wrought at the hands of Father St. Croix has largely been undone thanks to the leadership of the Jeddore family, but that has not removed the grudge we hold against him and his corrupt ilk within the former Newfie Mounties. Never again shall such villainy reign in Newfoundland or anywhere else our rule stands resolute, for the decline has been stopped. Now, thanks to the Jeddores, our national and cultural revival can fully begin, and paternalistic tyranny shall never hold a place here again."

With virtually no other recourse and with tensions running high, many call for the unfathomable reality of war. Though total war with the Canadians and their Entente allies would likely be an unwinnable hell, there is a slim possibility that we could force them to the negotiation table and assert our demands if we could wage a successful and lightning fast guerilla campaign aimed at occupying their major cities along with major government and military assets along the way.

Further surveyed and traveled by famed kin like the nature guide Joseph Sylvester who is largely credited with being one of the first Mi’kmaq to show this once-hidden Eden to the European settlers - with more recent honored visitors to this hallowed land being some delegates from the Kibbo Kift of the English exile and environmentalist esoteric John Hargrave, the wild and abundant lands of Miawpukek are the envy of the Atlantic Northeast, with Miawpukek standing as a living, breathing symbol of all we stand for.

nfl_mikmaq.27.d:0 "Our situation towards the Canadians now finalized, one of the few remaining matters left to deal with as we seek to fully consolidate Mi’kmaq control over the entire Dawnlands, has been focused on L'Île-d'Anticosti. Also called Anticosti Island, or Notiskuan by the local Innu and Natigostec by the Mi’kmaq, Anticosti Island is a deeply forested isle rolling with ferns and conifers as far as the eye can see when not fixated on the rocky coasts or river-carved canyons, located between the Jacques Cartier and Honguedo Straits in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, off the coast of Quebec. The island has shifted hands many times since the first European settlers arrived in 1680 from France, allegedly later being used by pirates and assassins to hide treasure around 1715 according to dubious and fantastical claims, then later being bought by and consolidated under the Anticosti Island Company in 1874 before being sold to the French chocolate maker Henri Menier in 1895 - who had the island massively renovated with his own villages, stocked fishing and lobster ponds, game reserves, and an attempt at some locally-established mining, peat, and lumber industries to get some use and revenue out of the place; all of which failed, with the deer he imported even causing the local black bear species to starve out and go extinct due to overcompetition for the island’s berry supply, which the bears relied on to fatten up for winter hibernation. Menier would continue to squander the island’s potential, using it as his private retreat until dying in 1913, leaving Anticosti to his brother Gaston who eventually sold it to the Wayagamack Pulp and Paper Company in 1926, before being taken over by the Consolidated Paper Corporation Limited in 1931. Home to a dying timber industry left ravaged by the British Revolution, the Great Depression, and Black Monday, Anticosti has been all but abandoned, with the two main old villages of English Bay and Fox Bay becoming ghost towns, leaving Port-Menier as the only settled site left, and leaving the current owners desperate to sell.\n\nHowever, this long history entirely ignores an even older history the island holds, for Anticosti has been used for thousands of years as an ancestral hunting ground, salmon fishery, and occasional settlement for we the Mi’kmaq. The island is also notable for its picturesque ecosystem that is home to unique flora and fauna, with a tenth of the island’s roughly 700 plant species described by brother missionaries and botanists Marie-Victorin and Rolland-Germain being considered rare such as the Ram’s Head Lady’s Slipper orchid, and with much of the local animals being marine mammals and rare birds despite some being extirpated by invasive species brought by European settlers, as well as the unique geological formations found here, such as the Utica Shale, Vauréal Falls, or its famed extensive fossil beds that pristinely capture a snapshot of the Ordovician Period roughly 447 and 437 million years ago.\n\nCalled Natigôsteg, meaning ‘forward land’, Anticosti Island exists at the western frontier of the Dawnlands, but our people have largely been forced to abandon it under increasing pressure over the last few centuries of European entanglement, leaving a piece of our Dawnlands our of our reach, until now. With Jeddore’s administration pulling Newfoundland and the rest of the Dawnlands out of the stagnant quagmire we once rotted in, we are now finally in a position to purchase Natigôsteg for ourselves, saving the island from European-caused rot at long last without having to resort to violence or subterfuge. With this historic purchase of an Indigenous group buying back their rightful land, we shall also enshrine broad and extensive protections in perpetuity to the island’s environment, creating Natigôsteg National Park to preserve this remarkable sanctuary, while also working to undo the damage caused to our ancestral hunting grounds by the European-brought invasive species that caused the extirpation of the local bears, foxes, deer mice, bats, martens, and otters. We shall also extend these protections to not only cover the biosphere, but also the archeological sites dedicated to the study of both prehistoric life and the prehistoric indigenous peoples of this region. So let us put in a bid these desperate failing loggers cannot refuse, and reclaim one of the final missing pieces of our culture and history."

Expecting the same broken promises and ignored treaties they wrought upon the indigenous peoples of North America for centuries, the local non-indigenous Newfies have largely been met with the relationship they wanted and that we promised to them. Despite our government’s focus on reviving the lost culture and history of the Mi’kmaq and other indigenous groups like the Innu and Inuit, our government and its sister government run by the local Newfies to handle their own internal matters and needs have cooperated largely in harmony, and most if not all of our new policies, protections, social programs, and economic advancements benefit them in some way too, all without being treated as second class citizens and all without any official forms of segregation, and with mixed race families even becoming more common than ever now as many intrepid new families bridge the gap further - especially among Acadians, or French Canadians from the Maritimes and southern Quebec aka the region of Acadia, who have long held close, friendly ties to the Mi’kmaq since the Mi’kmaq assisted and welcomed the first French colonists led by Pierre Dugua le Sieur de Mons to Port Royal in 1605, even in times when the rest of the Canadians and Newfies did not - for we are truly equals at long last thanks to Jeddore’s guidance. Cultural, spiritual, and socio-economic cohesion and cooperation between our communities have begun to become more accepted and widespread as a result as well despite our dual government approach, with the Acadians once again heading up these unofficial endeavors as the bridge between indigenous and White life in the region, with some of these Acadians even joining the Mi’kmaq police and territorial guard, embracing the legacy of when they helped us fight the British in the past.\n\nWith us handling the diplomatic affairs abroad and our relationship with the Canadians while finally enshrining Newfoundland’s autonomy and right to self-determination in perpetuity, we have secured the isolated independence that the White Newfoundlanders have long prized and fought to secure, while also allowing them to go about their daily lives unbothered by foreign would-be hegemons for we handle the bulk of those matters and headaches now. Left alone to their devices, the White Newfies are able to live their harsh but satisfying lives out in the stormy coastal wilderness and forested glens undisturbed by the wider world in their own Arcadian Idyll here in Acadia as they have always wanted - a sentiment we long have shared and now an idyll we can both enjoy. Creating a single paradise for two different worlds and two different societies symbiotically and irrevocably linked against their will has not been easy, but we have managed to do so, and now all we must do is maintain it."

nfl_mikmaq.30.d:0 "Perhaps one of the most prolific Wabanaki Indians of the twentieth century is Henry Perley, better known as ‘Chief Henry Red Eagle’, an entertainer who is widely known for his numerous pulp short stories, tourist literature, and his activities as one of the best wilderness guides in eastern Maine. Born on the 15th of February, 1887, Henry Red Eagle can trace his familial roots back to the Tobique First Nation in maritime Canada from which his parents left due to the lack of abundant game and settled in Greenville, Maine.From an early age it became apparent that Henry Red Eagle possessed immense talent (not unlike that of a ‘Kinap’ a traditional Wabanaki concept of a person gifted with great chiefly talent and power) as he was not only the first full-blooded Indian to both attend and graduate his local High School he was also the valedictorian of his graduating class of 1902. Following his graduation and a period of working at a drugstore Henry Red Eagle joined various ‘Indian Troupes’ that toured both the United States and Europe that provided an intimate (albeit a very stereotyped) look at Indian Culture. Beginning in the 1910s he began writing various pulp short stories and tourist works under his Red Eagle pseudonym; most famously for the magazine Argosy and the nature publication of the Bangor & Aroostook Railroad. It is of no surprise that most of Red Eagle’s pulp short stories dealt with the existence of the Indian in the Modern World challenging the preconceived white stereotype that ‘Indiandom’ (as was known by the white man) was functionally dead and stuck in a limbo of the current decadent era alongside sleeping on the bare ground, birch bark canoes, and the muzzle-loading gun. Most famously his stories ‘Injun Boss’ and ‘Night Riders of the Arrowhead’ placed indigenous characters at the forefront both embracing their heritage and culture while also thriving in the modern world with the titular characters being a lumber foreman and secret service agent respectively. Red Eagle’s tourist literature often extols the nature and ‘primeval forests’ of Maine while also oftentimes decrying the toil of the lumberman’s greed. While not necessarily anti-modernist as he often praised the accomplishments of dam builders or the time-saving measures provided by trucks, buses, and float planes; he does watch the ecological impact of industry with a measure of despair.\n\nMore recently with the reformation and grand rebirth of the Wabanaki Confederacy he has once again taken up the pen and has become a great advocate for our cause with him writing several short stories about Wabanaki heroes such as Chiefs Ambrose Saint-Aubin and Jean-Baptiste Cope. In addition to these short stories, Henry Red Eagle, has even got the ball rolling in the creation of a nascent film industry within the Dawnland with himself and other notable Indian actors such as Lucy Nicolar and Molly Spotted Elk starring in ‘Madockawando: Hero of the Confederacy’ a silent film epic that details the life of the aforementioned Chief and his actions during King Philip’s War. It was of no surprise that when asked for his aid Henry Red Eagle jumped at our request to help train our own nascent military and expand their ranger-forester abilities using his own expertise as both a wilderness guide and camp counselor. With this development the numerous council members of the Grand Council of the Confederacy can sleep a bit easier as this additional training of our young military is vital to the continued survival of the renewed Wabanaki Confederacy as the situation in North America and Europe remains ever precarious."

This 'occupation' was brought on by a formal request by the governors of these States, who have instructed their National Guard Units to assist the Canadian Authorities.\n\n This incident, while greatly inflaming tensions between Ottawa and Washington, has also had its effect here in Newfoundland. With our proximity to New England, many soldiers from the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and Royal Newfoundland Constabulary aided in Canadian operations in the area.

Countless others have fled to Canada due to their stable political climate and compatible cultures. Others have made a break for Mexico, Cuba or even Ireland. However a select few have tried to take up residence in none other than the Dominion of Newfoundland. At only a stone's throw from American Shores, the first boats of Refugees first washed up in the weeks following the outbreak of hostilities. The American Refugees, unfamiliar with the Economic hurdles faced by Newfoundland, were reportedly appalled by the destitute economic conditions and generally bleak atmosphere; with some Yankee refugees also being put off by the 'Incomprehensible' local accents. In what was even more of a shock, several refugees who departed for Newfoundland's shores found themselves fleeing not long after; either changing their destination to Canada proper, or deciding that bearing it in the war-torn United States was a better option than Newfoundland. The Government has secretly expressed relief that the Refugees are seeking alternative locations, as Newfoundland currently has neither the resources nor the ability to handle a refugee crisis."

The SS Sagona, a civilian vessel owned by the Reid Newfoundland Company and used as a ferry between Newfoundland and the northern coast of Labrador was sunk today by a Canadian Vessel which mistook them for a Union of Britain patrol ship. The source of the confusion stemmed from the ensign flown by the Ship, that being the flag of the Dominion of Newfoundland. Newfoundland, unlike their cousins in the now-former Dominion of Canada, did switch their iconic Red Ensign to a Blue one to avoid confusion with the Union of Britain, which flew a Red flag which bore a striking similarity to the Empire's trademark Red Banner.\n\n This tragic incident has once more sparked a debate within the House of Assembly on the fate of Newfoundland's flag, with many calling on [NFL.GetLeader] to change our flag to avoid such incidents in the future.\n\n Regardless of their choice, the RCN has offered a formal apology to the Government of Newfoundland for their awful mistake, and has promised to compensate the Reid company for their lost ship."

One such goodbye was an anonymously sent poem to The Evening Telegram, originally titled ‘The Farewell’, that read as a beautiful goodbye to the departing official. However, much more recently it was discovered that the poem had a twist, as it was instead an acrostic rather than a mere farewell, with the beginning of each sentence spelling out a single letter in a carefully constructed insult to the Governor-General, spelling out ‘THE BASTARD’. This discovery has led to humor among the readers of the Evening Telegram, with many simply laughing at the factor the poem managed to slip through the cracks and end up being posted in the original edition, as profanities are often barred from being put into print. Indeed, while the still mysterious authors of the poem meant it as an insult towards the political efforts of the Governor-General, it has had no effect in Newfoundland’s politics besides some embarrassment for lead editor of the Telegram, CEA Jeffries, who failed to catch the acrostic."

Despite most of the 'Exiles' coming to settle in Canada, a determined few spurned the domain of the Great White North, instead choosing to settle in the great Dominion of Newfoundland. It is not clear why they stay, as life in Newfoundland is far from the idyllic country that is our neighbor to the East. Indeed, most of the exiles who chose to live in Newfoundland were those in the lower-class who could simply not afford the full journey to Canada. Of those upper-class Exiles who have coalesced mainly around St. John's, most of them can afford to live like Kings, mingling with the likes of Newfoundland High Society - even if the social scene of St. John's is dwarfed by that of old Britain. These dedicated few have made untold connections both within Newfoundland and the remains of the Empire, something which has thrilled the Merchant Ruling class.

Wakeham is still providing a casualty toll and investigation into the fire, but it appears that this is already one of the greatest disasters in St John’s history as nearly a hundred people have been claimed by this sudden outbreak. Operated by the Knights of Columbus to house and entertain military men when they are off duty, the hostel which housed, fed and provided the off duty servicemen a place to socialize with a stage for singing and a projector for films. The hostel was packed full of people the day of the incident, with it even being caught on radio as when a Canadian soldier was starting his rendition of the song ‘The Midnight Trail’, someone in the crowd noticed and called out the fire, and a press to escape the crowded building began. With 80 servicemen and 19 civilians dead, an investigation on whether foul play could have been involved, is unfortunately producing some credibility. Although there is no hope of finding evidence to track down this arsonist, other fires have already occurred at clubs and hostels providing rooms and services to the many new visiting troops to St John’s, with a district Judge in St John’s stating that it is almost certain that enemy elements, likely Syndicalist in nature, are targeting our bases and citizens in North America.

One of these services is the notoriously reliable and beloved by rural communities, The Overland Limited, better known by its colloquial name of ‘The Newfie Bullet’ by foreign visitors which has managed to stick among our native populace. Operating as a 23 hour trip between the ferry at Port Aux Basques and the capital of St John’s, this surprisingly luxurious passage is also connected to numerous stops between many more isolated communities in the central parts of Newfoundland, that have grown and flourish as a direct result of this train route. While some urbanites and Canadian investors are eyeing the possibility of a highway that would connect the same route but half the time that the train currently takes, this speculation has already met resistance from rural communities that simply cannot see how the car could be better than the services of the Newfie Bullet. Indeed, the Newfie Bullet has made such a mark on Newfoundland life that it has been honored with the train being marked on stamps of the Newfoundland Postage, as well as a special batch of coins from the Newfoundland Mint.

This increasing usage of the term has spread to such an amount that businesses such as the Overland Limited have been called ‘The Newfie Bullet’ as mockery of our valued train, while sailors have begun creating pamphlets on how to ‘understand the guttural Newfie language’ while in port. This has led to some discussion by more interior minded politicians, who have begun demanding that foreign troops behave themselves while stationed here, with them trying to lobby for a law that will result in confinement to barracks for any soldier that uses the term ‘Newfie’ for any part of Newfoundland culture. Others have called this move drastic and unnecessarily tense towards our allied armed forces, as not only have we begun moving on from viewing the term as an insult, some have even begun using it as reference towards themselves with fierce pride, instead turning the slur into a common moniker.

nfl_flavour.9.d:0 "One of the oddities of Newfoundland affairs, especially our few and far between policies concerning nations outside the empire’s scope, is our current status of possessing the former French Colony of St Pierre and Miquelon. Only gaining an interest in our fellow maritime neighbor following the French Revolution in 1919, we were all too happy to allow the colony to remain in quiet limbo concerning its status, up until the following year of 1920 when the economic slump that was affecting the two islands resulted in increasingly frequent and escalating socialist agitation on the islands. Receiving orders from the Colonial Office in London, they granted our dominion control over the territory following the seizure of them, with the French not being consulted considering the uncertainty that was in the air with their government’s capability during their civil war.\n\nThis status has remained intact to this day, with our Dominion holding control over the territory's affairs. Remaining a humble addition to our own lands, there is a considerable downside however to controlling this colony, as its own economic troubles have simply added strain to our own burdens, with ironically its only profitable economic sector being the smuggling of booze following American and even our own Prohibition era’s. This drain on our budget has led to talks of potential handing off St Pierre and Miquelon to another state.\n\nThe first and most obvious answer would be to return it to the French, as the French populace have already made it known with a referendum they seek to return to French rule, and besides the civilian opinion, it would also be a good gesture between Anglo and French partnership in the Entente. Another option would be to hand it off to the Canadians, who most certainly have the resources needed to man the island’s defenses in the event of conflict. However, this option has already attracted controversy as pro-native Newfoundlander politicians such as Cashin have called out the attempt to simply hand off land for Canadian Interests.

Carrying 46 crew members and 191 passengers during the voyage, at 3:51 AM a torpedo plowed silently through the dark waves before impacting the Caribou. Quickly flooding from the devastating impact, those who managed to get to the top before it finally submerged below the waveline were immediately stuck floating in the frozen waters of the Atlantic in the dark. For its part, the escorting minesweeper Grandmere followed naval procedure and began looking for the cause of the sinking, with them spotting a submarine and attempting to ram it before it submerged, but to no avail. Taking the next two hours to lay depth charges attempting to destroy the hunter below the waves, the Grandmere after no success circled back to collect the survivors of the Caribou. While technically following procedure, this long delay meant that potential survivors had instead frozen or drowned in the waters before finally being picked up and brought to the hospital facilities in Sydney, Nova Scotia. Opting not to hide the tragedy of the SS Caribou, the censorship boards have chosen to allow the reports of the sinking through, with the civilian populations shocked that such an event has occurred right off our shores. Fishing Schooners have been immediately chartered by the Newfoundland Railway Company to carry out the grim task of collecting floating dead, and the final death toll of 137 has been given. 137 times did the bells ring in St John’s to remember the dead, among them many lost wives, children, and the Newfoundlander Captain, Benjamin Tavernor, and his two sons serving as the officers."

These ever present woodland deer have marked life in our nation since the very starting settlers landed ashore (with Leif Erikson probably having quite the surprise seeing the familiar deer in his newly found land), and have provided both the native Mi’kmaq who named the Caribou, as well as our British settlers with clothing, venison and even sleigh-bearing labor for the establishment of our nation. Whilst various parts of our nation utilize the domesticated Caribou for festivals, or even still for their ways of life in parts of Labrador and Mi’kmaq communities, and Newfoundland children being told of Santa’s sleigh being pulled by the hardy creatures across the northern sky, these beloved marks of our nation’s nature shall forever be a part of our culture."

Thankfully, where many are doomed to fall into obscurity due to the highly competitive and aged trade of Alcoholic Brewers, Newfoundland has long had its name known throughout the great wide north due to its native brand of Newfoundland Screech. A hearty rum with an even more impressive 40% alcoholic volume, this notable export of our nation has meant that it is an always present drink for Newfoundlander ceremonies and festivities, while connoisseurs throughout Canada and New England try and build up their own collection, a fairly pricey hobby due to the taxes put on exporting it in an attempt to get drinkers to come to St John’s.\n\nThis homebrewed drink however has more to its namesake than just profits for liquor stores, instead cultivating itself quite a reputation with the ‘Screech-In’ ceremony. Performed upon outsiders who have ended up in St John’s, this ceremony is one bestowed upon any who wish to have the notorious screech, the ceremony involves loudly asking if the visitor would like to become a Newfoundlander, a mockery of their homeland and accent, followed by a shot of the rum, a speech of reconciliation towards the newly-proclaimed Newfoundlander and the kissing of a frozen Cod. This embarrassing ritual that our citizenry subject to any visiting sailor, diplomat or tourist has resulted in the pubs of St John’s being rowdy with laughter late into the night by visiting parties, and an international love of Newfoundland Screech being born."

If these nay-sayers however had peered into the nightlife of St John’s, perhaps they would be quite shocked to see a near 24 hour operation of our pubs and restaurants, with midnight and beyond being peak hours as the six block radius of George Street gets crowded with citizenry seeking company, drink and feast. Surged nightly by crowds of St John’s citizenry, docked sailors and the wide-eyed surprise of visiting tourists, George street has become the very reliable business capital of St John’s and wider Newfoundland, with even our most dry politicians not being able to deny the growth to our GDP thanks to this single street turned midnight party hub. Open only to vehicle traffic to allow the liquor trucks to restock the emptied booze cellars of the many different storefronts, this pedestrian street is not only home to renowned pubs and restaurants, but also the ever-present percussion of guitars, cello’s and harmonica’s, as well as the new arrivals of Coffee and even Hot Dog stalls to the street. This famous street of St John’s has become a famed site for the nation’s citizenry, and is one we can be proud to show off to the world’s tourist population, with the only disapproval domestically of George Street being the complaints sent in by a singular protestant church near it that complains of the sinful guests being of the ‘catholic variety’."

The story of the previously stationary Scademia is one of long waiting periods in drydock, as it was built by a senior captain hoping to start a business providing boat tours and ferry services down the Narrows of St John’s, the aged crafter himself had piloting experience both as a sailor on voyages, but also as a rum-runner during the Dominion’s prohibition phase. Built by hand, the Scademia’s construction was consistently delayed by the Great Depression’s effects on the average Newfoundlander, with the crafter having trouble acquiring resources. So after a painstakingly slow construction process, the Scademia had further disappointment in its finished status, as the Great Depression still meant that the captain would not be able to properly manage a boat borne business during the economic woes, and so sold the newly finished sloop to one of the ferry companies that manage voyages between Canada and St John’s, particularly to one of its subsidiaries that would also manage boat tours during better times.\n\nDespite the very rocky beginnings of the ship’s life, the economic state of Newfoundland has recovered somewhat, and so now both the ship and captain can have a purpose as the company has hired him to pilot the ship during tours around Newfoundland and Labrador, and through the Narrows to the beautiful entrance to St John’s. Now becoming a popular name in the nation due to the thrilling nature of sailing down the Narrows on tours, with on boat ceremonies of the Screech-In for guests, the Scademia has become a popular name in the sailing community of Newfoundland."

While the cost to get one is higher here in Newfoundland than elsewhere in North America due to our isolation, we have seen enough of an increase in demand that it was only a matter of time before a plucky entrepreneur was to seize the spotlight and open up the first telecasting station in our country. Our government, which was reviewing the applications by prospective broadcasting companies, can be proud to say that the one most suited for the task of running St John’s very first television station was one of our own native companies. Starting as a venture that branched off from the already established radio networks of Newfoundland Broadcasting Company, Geoff Stirling, owner of CJON radio station has succeeded in using his radio expertise to establish a private television network firm. We have received a complaint from the Canadian Broadcasting Network which was also hoping to buy a license to do just that with a channel in St John’s in what seemed to have been a planned wider Canadian network, these Canucks have complained that foul play was involved on our part by choosing a native Newfoundlander who has had connections to our broadcasting regulations board in the past. These claims are being dismissed as the bitter statements of poor sports in the St John’s market, and we can instead focus on a much better task, enjoying the very first television shows, announcements and plays being televised directly from a broadcasting station to the living rooms of our households."

nfl_flavour.30.d:0 "A new fictional hit piece has washed ashore and rocked the commercial libraries and bookstores of our domain. Simply titled Dredge, this new piece of literature that has become a best seller throughout our country in record time is made all the more mysterious that it was seemingly written by an unknown pen name, with this ‘Captain Black Salt’ seemingly tracing back to no-one known to our nation. The novel’s premise revolves around a fisherman arriving to the isolated island town of Greater Marrow, which hires the fisherman to act as their angler for the community’s sustenance. The fisherman starts to realize that there is more to this job than it first seems, as the residents of the town seem deranged while the fish he catches seem to be sick with a malady or corruption. This further compounds itself into terrifying encounters on the seas at night, where luminescent fish covered in malevolent reds and purples, ghost ships and man sized anglers pursue the fearful fisherman into safe harbor. The seemingly all too real danger of these encounters start to fray the sanity of the fisherman, who continues to venture further out and discover that Greater Marrow was a larger community, with more islands that had their settlements seemingly swept away by storms or their vessels taken at sea. Brought into a plan by the mayor to salvage the sunken ruins of the old town, the fishermen’s greed of a final reward starts to cloud his judgment, with him performing final errands on the last, darkest night of the story. Finally, once the mayor’s crew climb aboard and they drift over the wrecks to dive in, the sea alights in a purplish light, with the eyes of an eldritch being judging them. Fleeing in a vain attempt, the giant aquatic creature directs the other corrupted fish to dash the fishing trawler on the rocks, before finally dragging it under with its tendrils, meanwhile the swarms of fish begin dashing through the waves towards the town in untold droves.\n\nThis twist of maritime adventure typical of our country mixed in the horror often expected of a writer like Lovecraft, many have even started circulating rumors that perhaps the man from Providence has graced our country with a novel based on our lifestyles. However, with no credibility to give towards any possibilities about who the ghost writer is, the best seller will remain an anonymous spectacle of our fiction."

nfl_flavour.31.d:0 "Following the declaration of war, His Majesty’s Governor-General was quick to immediately give Newfoundland’s authorities, particularly the Supreme Court, the ability to seize confirmed or suspected enemy vessels contained in our waters. Since then, port authorities, our naval patrols and even banks have begun writing up applications of boarding and seizure of foreign vessels in and around our Dominion.\n\nThis eager attitude by our maritime hosts to jump at the occasion has led to many unique legal cases and events unfolding on our seas. Certainly, none have been more common than the confusion surrounding the allegiance of French shipping and fishing around the coasts of Newfoundland, as our own mariners are concerned about whether these frogs off our coasts are allied Nationalist’s from Algiers, or subversive elements from the Communards. Vessels such as the Izarra and the Cancalais, and many others have been boarded by a variety of local police and royal marines, where they have been directed to safe ports and subsequently searched and investigated about their origins. Crafts found to be of Algerian or Nationalist origin were released and sent on their way, with only their holds of Fish lost to our customs officials claws, while those vessels found to have been sent from Communard owned ports have been seized and requisitioned by our own merchant fleet. Surprisingly, the Nationalist regime in Algiers has been very accepting of this policy of ours, understanding the practicality of it in wartime, and even offering their assistance in extraditing and imprisoning Communards that we catch on the high-seas.\n\nThose vessels not of French origin that have also been boarded have instead been routed to St John’s, where they undergo a similar process. This myriad collection of German, Danish, Argentinian and even a Finnish vessel have resulted in a much more troublesome appearance in our legal system, where the unknown status of Reichspakt aligned ships in our waters has meant that we may get into hot water with Ottawa for treading on their foreign relations due to our maritime seizure’s. Indeed, a German diplomat in Halifax has complained about the status of German ships in Newfoundland, and following a decree from the King himself, we have in turn started allowing jerry vessels to leave our territory without being seized. The same cannot be said for the Finnish and Danish vessels which have no such diplomatic immunity from our prized decrees."

While there would not be much more to this building than its status as an housing site to our government at first, recently it has begun seeing much more activity and gatherings under the direction of the Governor’s wives. Lady Edith Anderson and Lady Walwyn both have begun hosting gatherings of their ‘Jubilee Clubs’ at the Government House when their husbands are away tending to the matters of the day. Formed in 1929 when a typhoon rocked the shores of southern Newfoundland, what was at first Lady Anderson’s attempts to gather volunteers for relief efforts turned into an organization of proud Newfoundland women, gathering into what they called Jubilee Clubs. Now directed by the succeeding Governor-General’s Wife, Lady Walwyn continues the meetings and efforts of the clubs from her lawn at Government House, keeping the tradition of feminist circles, self-help advice and finding employment for the women of Newfoundland, Eileen has even expanded the scope of the clubs into the areas of fitness and trade-craft. Using teachers to teach the Dominion’s women on how to knit large cloth, woodcraft and even forestry, Lady Walwyn has made it her vocal goal to not only keep the women of Newfoundland busy during this economic slump, but also to expand their reach into rural areas of the country, which can in turn mean further development and opportunities inland.

Pre-warned that there would be an event concerning Governor-General Walwyn at the business, the press was already outside the quaint little shop, owned by a notable figure in Newfoundland’s history and its involvement in the Weltkrieg, Private Thomas Ricketts of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment, and currently the youngest holder of the Victoria’s Cross. Being just 17 years old when he earned the award, Ricketts was present during the fighting of fall 1918, where his quick thinking and valour resulted in the capture of a battery of Boche artillery, ignoring the ever present danger to himself during those actions. Being awarded the Victoria’s Cross by King George V himself, Ricketts would survive to the peace with honor and return home, where after attending school, he would open his very own pharmacy in St John’s, which leads us to today with the Governor’s visit. After the surprise of the visit wore off, Walwyn would hold a toast to the young VC recipient, and while the press were preparing to leave after an assumed quick public relations event, a shock arose in the room as the Governor-General publicly asked if the former soldier would return to the Royal Newfoundland Regiment as an officer. Already having the commission of Ricketts to the rank of a Major prepared, all that would be needed was the acceptance by the honored man himself, and in an emotional state, Ricketts accepted the commission to lead in a new age for the Newfoundland Regiment."

However, our fortune may be changing for the better, as one key figure has announced his intention to join our uprising and assist in the battle for Newfoundland’s very freedom. Thomas Ricketts, a veteran of the Weltkrieg who received the Victoria’s Cross for his exploits during the war, is offering his assistance to the Coaker government to help fight against any Entente incursion to retake Newfoundland. The merits of this individual alone may be all that’s needed to rouse the veterans into fighting for their home in the most direct sense, with Ricketts being given a command position in order to both put him in the spotlight, as well as to give the various generations who are fighting in the militias of the Fishermen’s Protective Union a rallying figure to answer to."

The recent collapse of the Fishing market has only served to strain relations between St. Pierre and Miquelon and the mainland further, as French fishing vessels, unable to sell their bounty, have been forced into a state of anxiety and unrest because of their prolonged, unprofitable and profitless stay in the islands. Further contributing to their disease is the suspension of the island's special status in Newfoundland's House of Assembly. After their annexation in the wake of the French Revolution, the two islands were guaranteed elected representation in Newfoundland’s legislature; democratic representation has ceased with the suspension of Responsible Government in the mainland. Ultimately, these feelings have resulted in a series of riots across the Island's two largest settlements, Miquelon-Langlade and St. Pierre.\n\nIn St. John's, some have favored a harsh crackdown on the islands, fearing that these riots may result in a Syndicalist uprising directly off our shores.

Prized for traits such as their soft mouths that don’t damage their master’s prey and their dense water-resistant and insulating coats, Labs and Newfies are known as reliable working dogs, loving household pets, and dependable companions in combat and support roles within the military or as rescue dogs. They have long been beloved by our locals, especially among Newfoundland’s many fishermen, as well as abroad in places like Great Britain, Canada, the United States, and beyond, and as such these breeds should always be revered, and so we shall push to capitalize on their popularity and versatility. Creating new breeding programs for them so that we may profit from the international community’s ceaseless demand for them as pets and work dogs, while also allowing us to use them domestically in greater numbers for the same reasons, we shall ensure that we have a steady supply of not only Newfies and Labs, but also for the near-extinct St John’s breed, bringing back this historic part of our history from the brink.\n\nFurthermore, we shall publicly honor famed specimens of these lovable breeds, such as Seamen - perhaps one of the most well-traveled dogs of all time as the scouting companion of Lewis and Clark on their expedition across America, or the Newfoundland named Hairyman that saved over 160 Irish immigrants from the wreck of the brig Despatch in 1828, as well as the unnamed Newfie that reportedly saved Napoleon Bonaparte during his famous escape from exile on the island of Elba as rough seas knocked him overboard, where a fisherman's Newfie jumped into the sea, and kept Napoleon afloat until he could reach safety. Thus, Labrador Retrievers and both types of Newfoundland dogs shall be enshrined forever as heroes and idols of Newfoundland and Labrador’s stoic history and culture. Whether they are helping us on the warfront or the homefront, or being pets for our fellow Englishmen across the pond and beyond, these steadfast companions shall remain a source of national pride and a symbol of our peoples’ resilience, loyalty, and drive to provide and survive here on our happy edge of civilization."

Therefore it’s no small surprise to hear that a maritime music tradition has followed foot, with sea shanties ranging from the upbeat call and response between captain and crew, to an increasing trend of sailors' blues covering tales of tragedy on the high seas. This unique blend of shanties that incorporate the tones of Celtic folk songs are unique to our Northern Atlantic shores, but are not the only example of Newfoundland creativity in the arts. One new instrument of rural ingenuity is taking the press by storm, and that is the so-called ‘Ugly Stick’. This device is often crafted using a simple stick -often times taken from a mop- with various attachments of metal cans and bells to create noise makers during folk songs in rural festivals and concerts. Besides those notable examples of native music, St John’s is often abuzz with various hymns and imported music, as the anthem playing from government houses contends with opera plays, and the rare phonograph has become synonymous with the import of Jazz to our shores."

Sensing an opportunity for a most unique tourist attraction, the government has begun advertising sight seeing of these icebergs, while entrepreneurs have begun ventures to cover the hosting and travel to coastal areas and even the tracking of icebergs across the ocean. These opportunities have resulted in quite an explosion of tourism by Canadians and Exiles to our isle, wishing to see the white giants of Iceberg Alley off our coasts while the businesses of more isolated ports and settlements enjoy the newfound profits. Such pursuits of further profit have resulted in some spectacular merchandise being sold, as shops begin selling bottled water tapped straight from the icebergs, while even breweries have begun selling specialty beer originating from the same sources.

Sweet tasting sides such as the notorious Figgy Duff raisin pudding and the baked Touton dough that fills the niche that Pancakes would in other countries, these bakery goods are often spotted at breakfast but can also be spotted replacing dessert due to their sweet nature. Another notable dessert here in Newfoundland is the infamous Bakeapple Pie, made from the indigenous cloudberry and named after the French phrase 'Baie qu'appelle?' meaning literally 'What's this berry called?'. Pan fried meats make up a surprising portion of lunch and dinner, with the meat of the moose that call Newfoundland home being available alongside venison and beef. Of course fish remains a large part of the common diet, and that too is often developed into more diverse meals such as Cod Tongues, that are harvested from the necks of caught cod and have formed quite a notable dish in our cities. Besides these meals that are custom to Newfoundland, we still take inspiration from our ancestors home on the British Isles, with the sunday dinner of corned beef and cabbage being given the moniker of ‘Jiggs dinner’ here due to the beloved comic ‘Bringing Up Father’ featuring it as the favorite meal of protagonist Jiggs.

The current Mayor of St. John's is none other than His Worship Andrew Carnell, nicknamed by many as the 'La Guardia of St. John's'. The suspension of Responsible Government has made Carnell the highest-ranking elected official in the nation, and has gained a status as a voice for disenfranchised Newfoundlanders unhappy with the course of Commission Government. The Commission, still viewing Carnell and the St. John's City Council as inefficient nuisances, have looked for ways to limit the power and influence of the Mayor.

nfl_flavour.44.d:0 "The most directly intertwined with Newfoundlander society of the four indigenous groups that live across our land, being the Mi’kmaq, the Innu, the Inuit, and the Labrador Inuit-Metis aka the NunatuKavut Southern Inuit, the Mi’kmaq (also called the Mi’kmaw, Micmac or L'nu) are a small yet impactful group on the island. Although they primarily live in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, the eighth sub-group of their culture cling to life on our stormy shores, and it is here that the Jeddore Family have dug their roots as they campaign for the ethnolinguistic, spiritual, and cultural revival of their people.\n\nThe Jeddore family has long been at the center of Mi’kmaq politics and culture, dating all the way back to We’jitu Isidore who was the Kji-Saqamaw of all Mi’kmaq across New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and Quebec in the late 1600s and early 1700s. Fast forwarding to the present day, his ancestor Joseph ‘Amité’ Jeddore works alongside his brother, the former Kji-Sagamaw Noel Joseph Jeddore, and his nephew Peter Jeddore in order to keep the family name clean and clear while guiding their fellow Mi’kmaq to a more equal and prosperous life. However, Noel is known for his more radical takes on anti-European issues, being the keeper of a tribal relic - in the form of an old Catholic prayer book watermarked in 1807 that is written in Mi’kmaq hieroglyphics aka the Komqwej wi’kasikl or the Gomgwejui'gasit - and infamous for losing the position as Saqamaw to his brother Joe, the current holder of the title, after impassioned outbursts against the erosion of Mi’kmaq culture and language at the hands of our past administration and their representative Father Stanislaus St. Croix. St. Croix himself arrived in the Dawnlands in 1916 and rapidly became an enemy of the Jeddores by purposefully driving a wedge between the most pro-Catholic among the Mi’kmaq and those like the Jeddores still fighting for our own unique culture and identity, all despite the Mi’kmaq largely living as model citizens peacefully and productively for ages, while also being quite open on the whole to religious conversion. Previously banning the Mi’kmaq language in churches and schools, promoting interracial marriages to whitewash their ethnic roots, and aiding in the passing of legislation that perpetually kept the Mi’kmaq and other First Nations peoples in generational poverty, the damage wrought at the hands of Father St. Croix has left its mark on the Mi'kmaq, but it is slowly being undone thanks to the leadership of the Jeddore family. However, that has not removed the grudge they hold against our government and those who protected St. Croix like the Newfoundland Rangers, and as such, we must keep an eye on them to ensure that they don’t try anything to rash while also not invading their autonomy too much so that relations may heal over time."

nfl_flavour.45.t:0 "The Death of Wilfred Grenfell"
nfl_flavour.45.d:0 "Passing away due to a coronary thrombosis while staying at his home across the border in Vermont, the good doctor Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell has given up this mortal coil. A British medical missionary and charity worker turned one of Newfoundland’s biggest philanthropists and humanitarians, Grenfell originally hails from Cheshire, England at Parkgate, being born in 1865, later moved to London in 1882 for schooling at the London Hospital Medical College under the tutelage of the famed Sir Frederick Treves, graduating in 1888 before finally being sent to Newfoundland by the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen charitable society in 1892 to improve the plight of the coastal inhabitants and fishermen, bringing two nurses and two doctors from England to aid him along the way, putting them to work at the local hospital at Indian Harbour in Labrador.\n\nGrenfell would take to this work immediately, seeking to bring the glories of modern medicine and proper healthcare to this oft-forgotten dominion, all the while working to open new cottage hospitals, industrial work projects, cooperatives, schools, orphanages, and social work projects all up and down the coasts of Labrador and Newfoundland, helping new settlements and programs to be established in places all over the isolated region in places like the Great Northern Peninsula, and even expanding the original aims of the mission to include helping the local indigenous peoples as well, with one of Grenfell’s most trusted assistants being a young Inuit girl named Kirkina that he helped secured new artificial limbs for before giving her an education and training as a nurse and midwife. This charity network still exists today despite his passing, and has since grown to become an international non-profit mission society as the International Grenfell Association, first formed in 1914 and still ever-expanding, providing and delivering healthcare and social services across the region, with the Grenfell Regional Health Services Board taking over operations in his absence, even being knighted by the King for his great efforts in 1927.\n\nNot stopping there, Grenfell is also known for his brave escapades and a few blunders as well, such as when he imported 300 Norwegian reindeer in 1907 to provide food, draft animals, and pelts for the Newfies without knowing that many of the imported beasts were infected with a parasitic roundworm that would eventually spread to the native caribou herds of Newfoundland and Labrador, with the imported reindeer dying out relatively quickly as the parasites - known vectors of cerebrospinal elaphostrongylosis - jumped to the local herds, causing issues for years. Also famously, during a medical emergency trip to an isolated Outport in 1908, Grenfell and his sled-dog team got stuck on a slob, or a piece of slushy sea ice, that was set adrift with Grenfell and his team aboard it. Surviving drifting aimlessly for days thanks to his dogs, with some tragically needing to be sacrificed so Grenfell could make thick clothing from in order to survive in the sub-zero wasteland he found himself in, Grenfell and his remaining dogs were saved nearly a week later by some villagers fishing in the area. The experience affected Grenfell deeply, with him even burying the dogs he had to sacrifice upon his return to civilization, erecting them a memorial with a plaque that reads ‘Who gave their lives for me.’\n\nIn his final years, Grenfell retired to a property in Vermont, where he spent most of his time in the company of his two children and his wife Anne Elizabeth Caldwell MacClanahan, who is stated to have given his life comfort and refinement, with MacClanahan being totally immersed in Grenfell’s life’s work up until she herself died of an illness just two years ago in 1938. A true knight of the British Empire and a true hero to the people of Newfoundland and Labrador, Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell shall forever be remembered and honored as one of the greatest amongst us, so let us all give a moment of silence to our humanitarian lionheart."

nfl_flavour.46.t:0 "Remembering the Viking"
nfl_flavour.46.d:0 "In 1930 and 1931, American-born producer Varick Frissell and American-born director George Melford came together under the financial backing of Paramount Pictures in order to film a nautical epic that takes place in our own neck of the woods here in Newfoundland, with the location being chosen partially thanks to Frissell’s and Melford’s own background with Canadian productions, with Frissell being involved in other short films centered in Labrador in the past such as ‘The Lure of Labrador and The Swilin' Racket ’, aka ‘The Great Arctic Seal Hunt’, and with Melford being a graduate of Montreal’s McGill University himself. The plot revolves around a rivalry between a local seal hunter named Jed Nelson (played by Arthur Vinton) and his rival Luke Oarum (played by Charles Starrett), a local jinx, with the film following their rivalry as the seal hunter fears the jinx is trying to steal Jed’s wife (played by Mary Joe), all the while the Captain, played by real life captain Robert Abram Bartlett, tries to maintain the peace and keep everyone alive. Coming to blows and trying to kill each other, the duo must eventually learn to work together in order to survive after being injured and stranded on run-away ice flows, which they do, forging a new friendship upon their return to civilization.\n\nGiven a budget of about $100,000, the film team began their preparations throughout 1930, with Frissell doing principle photography on location in Quidi Vidi, before on-location filming with the full crew at Grand Banks and Labrador in 1931.The film was to be Newfoundland’s first modern epic, with the famous Newfoundland humanitarian hero Sir Wilfred Thomason Grenfell even having a small speaking role in the movie, but tragedy would soon strike. Fueled by hubris and a desire to make true cinema, Frissell had decided that the movie needed more ‘real’ scenes, forcing the film crew to join the real crew of the SS Viking - the fishing and sealing ship they were using for filming - on its annual seal hunt, filming along the way. Not satisfied however, Frissell would push for the crew to film atop an actual iceberg out near the Horse Islands, spelling their final doom. On March 15, 1931, during this filming, a small fire would start accidentally aboard the ship, eventually making its way to the ship’s oil storage, causing a massive explosion that killed Frissell, the crewmate Alexander Penrod, 25 other film crew members, and a previously unbeknownst stowaway, marking the deadliest film accident in history. The survivors were forced into two groups by the chaos, with one group forced to trek across the ice to safety while the other was able to be rescued by some fishing vessels active in the area, though both eventually made it back to civilization relatively safely.\n\nDespite the accident, the film was still finished, released just a few months later during the following June, being met with horrid reviews in regards to the plot and to the disaster during filming, but also met with immense praise for its cinematography and its ability to capture the dangerous beauty of the icy seas and coasts around Newfoundland, especially among locals, and also has been lauded for its use of technology, being the first film to record sound and dialogue on location, using magnetic wire recording techniques. Now five years on from that horrible tragedy, we Newfies stand together as one as we still honor those lost in the pursuit of art and capital. May they rest eternally at peace."

nfl_flavour.47.t:0 "The Moravian Missions in Labrador"
nfl_flavour.47.d:0 "European settlement in Labrador goes back a few centuries, but this arduous and divisive saga was first begun by Moravian missionaries during the 18th century. In 1752, Moravian missionary Johann Christian Erhardt organized a mission to Labrador, settling near what is now today called Makkovik, establishing what they called Hoffnungsthal, or ‘the valley of hope’ aka Hopedale. However, as some stayed behind in Hopedale in order to build a log cabin shelter and a working garden for the mission, Erhadt left with the ship’s captain and five crew members in order to attempt a trade deal with the local Inuit to the North, but Erhadt’s group never returned, and were never seen again, likely dying violently at the hands of the Inuit due to the strained and violent relationship early European settlers in North America shared with the indigenous locals. This caused the rest of the mission to flee hastily back to Europe, and it would take 10 years and the end of the Seven Years’ War in 1763 for another group of the Moravians to attempt a new mission.\n\nFollowing logs and date charted by the explorer Jens Haven, who completed three exploratory expeditions throughout Labrador, in 1764, 1765, and 1770, the Moravians would eventually return, even aided by Governor Hugh Palliser of Newfoundland who himself thought the Moravians would be able to relieve tensions with the Inuit somehow, likely through use of religious conversion, despite the fate of the last mission. However, it was the 1765 journey that would be more impactful, for as Palliser and Haven trekked about Labrador, they were introduced to an Inuk woman named Mikak, and after two years of attempts to foster friendlier ties between the European settlers and the Inuit, an altercation would break out in 1767 which would lead to Mikak being taken hostage by the British. Seen as a valuable asset that could mend the bridge between our cultures, Mikak was taught English as she herself taught Inuktitut to the settlers so that the two groups could better communicate with one another. Eventually in 1768, Mikaka was taken to England with Jens Haven, where she charmed the English aristocracy and helped the Moravians get a new mission grant for about 100,000 acres of land in Labrador. Upon her return to Labrador in 1769, Mikak would work with the local European settlers and Inuit communities while promoting peaceful unity and cooperation between their groups, which actually worked at least for a time, allowing the first permanent European settlement in Labrador to be established in 1771 by Jens Haven, his new bride, and eight single men along Labrador’s northern coast, being built at the Inuit gathering site known as Nuneingoak, and being dubbed Nain. Nain not only was the first permanent European settlement in Labrador, but also became the first Christian mission for the Inuit in all of Canada, even rapidly evolving over time into a key trade hub and diplomatic shared-space between the indigenous locals like the Inuit and their counterparts the Moravians and other European settlers, with the Europeans even relying on the Inuit to survive and thrive since they only received shipments from the supply ship Harmony once a year. Nain would also function as the hub of European settlement attempts in the region as explorers came from Europe and beyond to Nain in order to set out across the Great North in order to explore further unreached wildernesses, with other similar missions being founded such as Okak in 1776, the resettlement and reopening of Hopedale in 1782, Hebron in 1830, and many more like Zoar, Ramah, Makkovik, Killinek and more, with a more modern example also being seen with the creation of the Goose Bay air base, which also led to new missions appearing in Happy Valley-Goose Bay, Northwest River, and Pottsville, all coming together to help the Moravians maintain the trade monopoly on the region they’ve held for centuries, though this has slipped away in recent years as Newfoundland become more ‘civilized’ and connected to the rest of the world.\n\nHowever, all was not forever copacetic with the native Inuit. Although the missions helped usher in great breakthroughs for the Inuit, such as new fishing technologies and techniques, early forms of self-governance through the Council of Elders, modern timekeeping, or even the concept of written language for the Labrador Inuit aka the Labradorimut were the first Inuit to write in their own language, their own unique culture was also eroded greatly by the Moravians and other settlers. The missions banned Inuit religion in favor of their own take on Christianity, forced the Inuit to abandon their nomadic way of life which had persisted for untold centuries if not millenia, would eventually turn to the residential school system like much of Canada did as well, taking Inuit and other indigenous youths from their homes, often forcibly, in order to be abused and indoctrinated into the White Man’s World. Now, as many of the old isolated missions close and the Moravians begin to shift more of their operations into our ‘major’ towns and settlements, we must hope that they continue to do more good than harm."

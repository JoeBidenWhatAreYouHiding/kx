entf.1.t:0 "The Hobbit, or There and Back Again"
entf.1.d:0 "The George Allwen and Unwin publishing house has put out a new book by British émigré J. R. R. Tolkien, who returned to South Africa following the revolution. It tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a strange small creature called a Hobbit, who goes on an adventure featuring wizards, dwarves, giants, goblins and a fire-breathing dragon before returning home a wealthy man. The tale has already received widespread critical acclaim and Tolkien has been nominated for literary prizes. There have been hints that he is working on something longer and larger, but the author's notorious perfectionism might well delay its publishing."

After achieving major victories thanks to Arab help, such as taking Jerusalem, he was forced to withdraw as the Weltkrieg went bad for England.

entf.8.t:0 "The Downfall of Númenor"
entf.8.d.nottolken:0 "The Allwen and Unwin publishing house today released a new book by the South African author J.R.R. Tolkien. The Downfall of Númenor tells the story of the destruction of the mystical island Kingdom of Númenor, who set out to free the continent of Middle Earth from the reign of the dark lord Sauron, but in the end fell victim to it's own weakness and corruption, and the Gods sank their proud island beneath the uncaring waves of the sea. Only a small band of men still loyal to the Gods were able to flee the cataclysm of the sinking island, to found new realms in distant lands. Professor Tolkien denies that his book was inspired by the British and French postwar revolutions, and states that the initial ideas for this story, and others set in the same world of Middle Earth, came to him during his time as a soldier in the trenches of France."

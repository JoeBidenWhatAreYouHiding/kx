It embodies the revolutionary spirit of oppressed Tatar peasants and the national-religious narrative of the Tatars' direct lineage from Volga Bulgaria. The Wäisi movement holds the conviction that there are significant parallels between the teachings of the Quran and Shariah and contemporary socialist ideologies. Consequently, they aspire to restore the islamic Volga Bulgarian nation through a sacred and righteous revolution, guided by the principles of Allah, no matter the cost."

TTR_Lessons_Of_CW: "Lessons of the Civil War"
TTR_Lessons_Of_CW_desc: "The Russian Civil War was one of the bloodiest conflicts of the modern era, costing the lives of millions to a foolish conflict over ideology that only caused more problems for these lands. However, if we learned one thing from that hell, it was how to effectively wage war in this new, rapidly evolving era we find ourselves in. From the carcasses and chaos of that fratricide, we shall learn everything we can about doctrine and strategy, better preparing us for the next war."

By establishing a specialized department near the mountains, where officers will be selected for training, and by selecting local soldiers, as well as by conducting an active campaign to attract the local population to the mountain units, we expect to create 2 regiments. In addition, we are introducing basic mountain operations vision lessons into the standard officer training courses."

TTR_Exile_Russian_Loyalists_desc: "For decades, our people have suffered under policies designed to erase our language and culture. Now, we have the opportunity to reverse these injustices, restoring the Idel-Ural languages to prominence and reviving our traditions. The remnants of Russian influence pose a direct threat to our sovereignty and national unity. Individuals who remain loyal to the Russian state are potential collaborators, capable of undermining our independence from within. To safeguard our future, these elements must be removed from positions of power and, if necessary, exiled from the Idel-Ural."

TTR_Seek_Ottoman_Recognition_desc: "The Ottoman Empire once stood as the guardian of Muslims across Eurasia, and even in its modern form, [TUR.GetNameDefCap] remains an influential force in the Islamic world. Gaining their recognition would elevate Idel-Ural’s legitimacy, providing both diplomatic and economic benefits.

TTR_Win_Over_The_Merchants_desc: "The backbone of Tatar commerce has always been its merchant class, whose influence stretches from Kazan to the great Eurasian trade routes. If the Legion is to secure economic stability, it must court the support of these powerful business elites. By offering them protection, favorable policies, and economic incentives, we can ensure their loyalty and use their financial prowess to fuel our national ambitions.

TTR_Punish_The_Red_Guards_desc: "The so-called Red Guards — remnants of socialist movements that once sought to crush Idel-Ural nationalism — still lurk in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to strike. They will receive no such chance. Their treachery will be met with swift and merciless justice. Their leaders will be hunted down, their networks dismantled, and their ideology wiped from the memory of our people. Idel-Ural must never again fall prey to foreign ideologies that seek to weaken its spirit."

TTR_Young_Guard_Takes_Over: "The Young Guard Takes Over"
TTR_Young_Guard_Takes_Over_desc: "The older generation laid the foundation for our nationalist movement, but now a new wave of leaders — the Young Guard — must take the reins.

TTR_Exile_Democrats_desc: "The Mäjlese, an influential council of democratic elites, represents a direct challenge to the Legion’s authority and vision for Idel-Ural. Its liberal and progressive ideals threaten to destabilize the military-led unity we’ve fought for. To secure the strength of the Legion, we must undermine the Mäjlese’s influence, discredit its leaders, and dismantle its political power. By eroding its credibility among the people and elites alike, we will remove the last obstacle to our rule and ensure that Idel-Ural remains firmly in the hands of nationalists."
TTR_Separate_Church_And_State: "Weaken the Clergy Influence"
TTR_Separate_Church_And_State_desc: "Tatar Islamic clergy, once a powerful force for spiritual and social order, has begun to overstep its bounds in political affairs.

Described as a serpentine, dragon or wyvern-like beast with the body shape of a massive bird of prey, the legs of a rooster, the tail of snake, and the ears of a wolf, with crimson wings and dagger-like teeth, and adorned with dark grey and black scales and feathers, this beast of legend has long been a ferocious symbol of our nation, being depicted on the Khanate flag and displayed in most public settings as a symbol of Tataria and our strength.

### Events ###
ttr.1.t: "The Failed Idel-Ural State"
ttr.1.d: "Following the contours of territorial autonomy that began to emerge in the aftermath of the February Revolution, the political activism of the Tatar community also gained momentum. Their flagship project was the vision of the Idel-Ural State, an aspiring federal entity within Russia that aimed to unify the Turkic-Tatar population of interior Russia and secure access to the shores of the Caspian Sea.\n\nIn order to implement this project of autonomy, the Millät Mäjlese (National Assembly) was established — the national assembly of the Turkic-Tatar Muslims of Inner Russia and Siberia, founded by the decision of the Second All-Russian Muslim Congress.\n\nHowever, the proclamation of the state, scheduled for March 1st, 1918, was thwarted by the Bolsheviks. Power was transferred to them, and Sadri Maksudi, the president of the failed Idel-Ural State, left Russia.\n\nAlready in August 1918 Kazan Gubernia fell under the control of Komuch. The City Duma in Kazan was reinstated, and the City Council once again assumed its executive role. Representatives from the right-wing and center factions of the Duma commenced their activities. Local governing bodies were transformed into quarterly committees, engaged in unselective searches and arrests, targeting not only supporters of the Soviet regime but also their perceived adversaries. The fragility of power in the city was further exacerbated by the simultaneous operations of multiple counterintelligence organizations. The conflicts between military and civil authorities, as well as between businessmen and workers, accompanied by indiscriminate gunfire, resulted in instability within the government and growing dissatisfaction with the Komch regime, particularly among the working class. On September 3rd, in response to the arrest of delegates from a non-partisan workers' conference, an uprising erupted among workers, centered around the powder factory. The rebels aimed to seize control of Zarechye and the Krasnaya Gorka railway station, breach the front lines, and establish contact with Red Army units. However, due to the intervention of military forces, the uprising was swiftly suppressed, with its leaders facing execution.\n\nBut with the uprising of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, the assassination of Vladimir Lenin and the seizure of gold reserves by Komuch troops, the days of the Bolsheviks were already numbered. All power in Russia soon found itself in the hands of white forces, including in the whole of Tatarstan."
ttr.1.a: "Interesting."

ttr.2.t: "Tatarstan in 1936"
ttr.2.d: "Even before the end of the Russian Civil War, at the behest of the all-Russian government under Kolchak, the existence of all national autonomies was abolished. Many representatives of indigenous peoples were compelled to emigrate and never return.\n\nAt the second Constituent Assembly, the national and cultural self-determination of the peoples was recognized. However, in contrast to the Alash and Turkestan autonomies, power in Kazan and Ufa remained mainly in the hands of the central Russian government. In theory, Tatars were granted all the rights afforded by national and cultural autonomy. Nonetheless, local governance remained vested in local Dumas and municipal councils, much like under the rule of Komuch.\n\nThe aspirations of the Tatars for sovereignty or, at the very least, territorial autonomy were not fulfilled, but neither were they forgotten. In the wake of the revolutionaries regaining power in central Russia and the onset of a new civil war, in Kazan Gubernia local militias are actively organizing. Many various forces are trying to seize power and reinstate their unique vision of the Idel-Ural State."
ttr.2.a: "Tatarstan - super good!"

ttr.3.t: "The Legions Liberate Tataria!"
ttr.3.d: "Almost as soon as the formation of the Red Guard in Kazan under the aegis of the Milli Shura commenced, a response began — a long-simmering counter-revolutionary and nationalistic movement. It all commenced with a radio broadcast on behalf of Gabdrakhman Galiullin, better known in certain circles by his pseudonym Shafi Almas. He was a businessman who owned his own shops in Moscow, Orenburg, and Kazan prior to the revolution. During the Civil War, he tried to fight for the establishment of the Volga–Ural State but fled to Turkey when Kazan fell to the Bolshevik onslaught. In recent years, due to the crisis in the Ottoman Empire, Galiullin returned to Russia in the hope of trying his luck there — and an opportunity presented itself.\n\nThus, on the behest of this obscure entrepreneur, the establishment of the Tatar legions was proclaimed, intended to safeguard order and resist any attempts by the Muslim Socialist Committee and the Red Guards to impose revolution on Tatarstan. The slogans of independent Idel-Ural are actively propagated within this new movement, with recruits predominantly comprised of youth and students seeking retribution for the suppressed freedom of Tatars.\n\nWhile this movement remains in its nascent stages, its impact is already palpable, as legions have been established in all major urban centers of the region, and Galiullin has announced the formation of a coordinating body for the legionary cause."
ttr.3.a: "Will they work willingly with us?"

ttr.4.t: "Sadri Maksudi Returns From [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
ttr.4.d: "As soon as news spread that power in Petrograd had been transferred to the workers and the revolutionary government, Sadri Maksud Arsal, professor of history of law and philosophy at [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] University, submitted his resignation and departed for Kazan.\n\nThis esteemed professor, who had completed his studies at the Sorbonne, had arrived in the city incognito just last week, but today, he made an official appearance on the podium in Kazan. Of course, his identity was quickly revealed — Sadri Maksudi is a well-known figure in the Muslim scholarly community, particularly among the Tatars, where he is revered as the first president of the Idel-Ural Republic, albeit one that never achieved full statehood. He was welcomed by Ilyas Alkin, who also said that Maksudi will take his seat in the Milli Idarä"
ttr.4.a: "Tatarstan will be free."

ttr.5.t: "Ilyas Alkin's Sudden Presidency"
ttr.5.d: "The first to respond to the revolutionary rhetoric in Petrograd unquestionably was Ilyas Alkin. A member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the newly elected mayor of Kazan, he was a hereditary political figure, the son of Seyid-Giray Alkin, deputy of the First State Duma and a prominent figure in the formation of the Tatar autonomous movement. As one of the organizers of the first All-Russian Muslim Congress in Moscow in May 1917, Seyid-Giray delivered a speech on the principles of cultural and national self-determination. After the Revolution, he withdrew from political life and devoted himself to reforms in the legal system of Kazan province, serving as a people's judge until his passing in 1929.\n\nBut let us return to Ilyas, the veteran of the Weltkrieg, who became a prominent figure in the aftermath of the February Revolution. In 1917, he assumed the position of Chairman of the Provisional All-Russian Military Council for Muslims, advocating for the autonomy of Muslim communities in Inner Russia and Siberia. He also served as the head of the Finance Department for Idel-Ural State and was elected as a representative from Kazan province to the First Constitutional Assembly.\n\nFollowing the failure of the autonomy movement, Ilyas was forced to flee Kazan, only to be apprehended by Kolchak forces in Yekaterinburg. However, his release was facilitated by the intervention of the Czechoslovak Legion, leading to his subsequent employment as Chief of Staff for the Bashkir Army. Upon the dissolution of this unit, he once again fell into the hands of the White Guard, who incarcerated him in Moscow on charges of separatism.\n\nFollowing his amnesty after the convening of the Second Constituent Assembly, Ilyas Alkin embarked on a career as a professor at the Moscow Commercial Institute. There, he rose to the position of head of the Department of Economics and Geography for the foreign East. However, fate intervened, leading him back into the realm of politics. In 1933, he contested the elections for the Kazan City Duma, aiming to secure the post of City Head (Gorodskoy Golova) from the ranks of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. His aspirations were met with success, securing his position as the duly elected leader of Kazan."
ttr.5.a: "We must work with all Tatar political forces."

ttr.6.t: "Red Guards in Kazan"
ttr.6.d: "Within a mere few hours of the proclamation of the revolution in Petrograd, spontaneous formations of Red Guard units commenced in Kazan, operating independently and unaccountable to any authority save for the similarly spontaneously established soviets of working-class and peasant representatives. These disorganized elements even engaged in sporadic acts of plunder, but once the Milli Shura emerged, these disparate bands found a new source of direction.\n\nNonetheless, we cannot condone such a state of affairs within the military hierarchy. The Milli Idarä has had enough of the undisciplined Tatar Legion, even if it is more organized than before, for it remains unaccountable to the central authority. Our allies in the Milli Shura insist that, under their supervision, the Red Guard would maintain allegiance to the government; however, the leadership appears to be uneasy about this prospect.\n\nWe must address the issue of disbanding these revolutionary units immediately and incorporating all volunteers willing to join the newly established national army of the Republic, under the strict supervision of Härbi Shura. This, however, is likely to strain our relations with our socialist allies.\n\nAlternatively, if we permit Milli Shura to continue assembling the Red Guard, we may gain their support and strength to counteract the Tatar Legion."
ttr.6.a: "Unless we have a monopoly on power, we cannot be considered a state."
ttr.6.b: "The coalition against the Legion is more important to us!"

ttr.9.t: "The National Board"
ttr.9.d: "As Russia descended into a fresh spiral of chaos, revolution, and civil war, Kazan embarked on a whirlwind of power consolidation. The Kazan City Council, under the leadership of Ilyas Alkin, the newly elected city head of Kazan, declared the seizure of power and proclaimed the independence of the Tatar Republic.\n\nHowever, the aspirations of one city could not represent the aspirations of all Tatars. As Legionnaires seized control in the provinces of Tatarstan, the infant republic required robust support and a legitimate administration. In response, Alkin initiated the establishment of two institutions: the National Board (Milli Idarä), serving as an interim government until free and fair elections could be held, and the Military Council (Härbi Shura) tasked with reinstating Tatar regiments, establishing a national army, and assuming control over paramilitary units.\n\nWhile the Milli Idarä comprised delegates from diverse political factions, yet Alkin, a member of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, advocated for the Socialists to secure a majority in this council. While we don't have full power yet, we can already implement some reforms."
ttr.9.a: "We must get ready for free and fair elections."

ttr.10.t: "The Härbi Shura"
ttr.10.d: "On March 28, 1917, the Kazan Muslim Military Council considered the report of Ilyas Alkin with a proposal to create a Tatar Military District in the inner provinces of Russia, in which Muslim soldiers (not only Tatars) would serve in all its territories. At the suggestion of Ilyas Alkin, the congress unanimously adopted a resolution on the creation of Muslim military units. To coordinate this work, a Temporary Muslim Military Council (Harbi-Shuro) of 12 people is already being created throughout the country. The Muslim military units were to become, among other things, a guarantee of the realization of the right of the Muslim peoples to their self-determination.\n\nThe "Whites" in the civil war firmly stood on the positions of the unitary state and with all their might opposed the self-determination of the peoples of Russia. At the same time, the Military Council was sharply anti-Soviet and Harbi-Shuro was eventually liquidated by order of the Council of People's Commissars.\n\nHowever, with the entry of Tatarstan into the Russian Republic as an autonomy, the military forces of the republic were not restored, and the territory came under the full control of the federal Russian Army.\n\nIt is time to remember that we still have power over our land, to restore the Military Council, consisting of Tatars!"

ttr.20.d: "Another prominent figure from the Tatar Renaissance literary movement and an active participant in political events from 1905 to 1918, Ayaz Iskhaki, has recently returned from exile. This man played a pivotal role during the tumultuous period of the First Russian Revolution. He actively engaged in the nationalist movement, organizing the secret Shakird society and serving as the leader of an illegal political organization for Tatar youth in Kazan known as 'Horriyat'. He also led the Tatar SR group of Tangists and represented the interests of young Tatar radicals at congresses of the Ittifaq al-Muslimin, a party of Russian Muslims. His activism earned him 18 arrests and periods of exile. This remarkable individual, a true champion for the freedom of his people, was compelled to seek refuge abroad after Russia quashed the aspirations of the Tatars.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Idel-Ural state and the dissolution of national autonomies by Kolchak's government, Ishaqi relocated to Berlin, and then to the Ottoman Empire. In [TUR.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] he delivered lectures on the persecution of Islam in Russia, including the closure of mosques and harassment of clergy under the guise of secularism. Additionally, he traveled to several countries in the East, such as Egypt, Persia, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Morocco. Over the past three years, he has also visited countries in the Far East. During his travels, he engaged in various initiatives aimed at unifying the Turkic-speaking Tatars residing in the Qing Empire, the League of the Eight Provinces, Fengtian Manchuria and Japan. He also convened a congress in Shenyang, which was attended by Turko-Tatar Muslim communities from the Far East.\n\nUpon the declaration of the Tatar Republic, Ayaz Iskhaki, having returned from Japan, joined the ranks of Milli Idarä in Kazan, where he engaged in public readings of his own works and dedicated considerable attention to Ğabdulla Tuqay, our national poet."

ttr.21.t: "The Legions Grow Stronger"
ttr.21.d: "What began as a modest nationalist volunteer initiative is rapidly evolving into a formidable organization. Today, a parade of Tatar Legionaries was held in Kazan, during which their leader, Gabdrakhman Galiullin, delivered a speech. He declared: \"Our struggle is not merely against Bolshevism, which is rising and encroaching on Tataria; it is also against the very foundations of Russian imperialism.\n\nThe Tatar peasantry in Russia has been artificially uprooted from their land, deliberately relocated to desolate regions, Tatar villages have been separated from urban centers, their culture has been suppressed, and the Tatar population has been geographically dispersed, subjected to enforced Christianization and Russification. Despite the fact that Tatar youths have perished for the Russian monarchy, the people remain oppressed and disgraced.\"\n\nTo the cheers and acclamations of the marching Legionaries, Galliulin proclaimed: \"No state of Russia shall ever tell us to have our country, our wealth, and live freely, using it as we see fit.\"\n\nHis speech had a profound impact not only on the Legionaries who were already committed, but also on those who had merely been spectators, passively observing the events until that moment.\n\nShould the Legion succeed, Idel-Ural would be reestablished through the blood of those Russians who had claimed these lands. The Legion stands above all else."
ttr.21.a: "They are getting more dangerous."

ttr.22.t: "Decree on Legions"
ttr.22.d: "The increasing influence of the Legions has become intolerable for the government. Initially, they \"liberated\" the Tatar towns, yet transferred power to our representatives. However, with each passing day, their arrogance grows.\n\nRecently, an incident took place in Chistay, where one of our officials was accused by the Legionaries of \"Bolshevism\" due to his left-wing policies on several issues. He was nearly lynched, but representatives of the Milli Shura intervened in time. He was then released \"on bail\" and forced to step down.\n\nThis horrific event has only heightened our concerns about the Legions. Now, both the Härbi Shura and Ilyas Alkin openly oppose the continued unrestrained movement of the Legions.\n\nPursuant to the emergency decree issued by Milli Idarä, the so-called Tatar legions are to be immediately disbanded, or rather, transferred from the control of Galiullin and Yarullin - under the supervision of the Military Council, and integrated into the fledgling national army.\n\nWhile the Legion itself will continue to exist as a political entity, any paramilitary organizations will be prohibited, as the state alone should maintain a monopoly over the use of force and the administration of law.\n\nThis decree has now been promulgated, and directives demanding the immediate disarmament of the legions and their enlistment as recruits in the national army have been issued to the leaders of the Tatar Legion, with immediate effect."
ttr.22.a: "Demand dissolution of the Legions!"

ttr.23.t: "The Legion Dissolved"
ttr.23.d: "In accordance with the agreement reached between Ähmät Yarullin and the Härbi Shura, Gabdrakhman Galliulin was dismissed from his position as commander of the legions, and the legions themselves came under the authority of the Härbi Shura. Despite the fact that the legionaries attempted to resist efforts at disarmament in several localities, following Ähmät Yarullin's editorial in a newspaper urging support for the republican government in opposition to the rampant socialists, the legionnaires surrendered their weapons."
ttr.23.a: "At least we got rid of one problem."

ttr.24.t: "The Legion Refused to Subordinate"
ttr.24.d: "As we had feared, the Legion has refused to submit. Their leader, a drunken Gabrakhman Galliulin, has declared defiance against the \"Bolshevist Milli Shura and their puppet government, who have seized power in the country\". He has called upon the legionnaires to resist any attempt to disarm them. Clashes have broken out throughout the country, and our militia is clearly not sufficient to deal with the motivated nationalists. The nation is on the brink of civil war."
ttr.24.a: "What do they think of themselves?!"

ttr.25.t: "March on Kazan"
ttr.25.d: "In the wake of our sorrowful edict on the disbanding and subjugation of the legions, the situation has taken a dramatic turn. Now, having amassed a formidable contingent of legionaries, their commanders have declared an advance on Kazan with the intention of ousting the socialists seeking to seize control of the city. The time has come to brace for the decisive confrontation."

The legionnaires attempted to seize control of key strategic locations such as the post office, telegraph offices, and administrative buildings.\n\nThe heart of the city found itself in a state of turmoil, with the legionnaires pressing forward towards the governmental complex. For the second day in a row, the fighting raged on, leaving it uncertain as to who would emerge triumphant."
ttr.26.d: "$ttr.26.d.intro$\n\nHowever, the forces of the Legion were not sufficient to overcome the resistance. The government's mobilized supporters strongly opposed this audacious attempt at a coup. The arrest of Gabdrakhman Galliulin, the leader who attempted to deliver an impassioned speech from the barricades, dealt a critical blow to the Legion's efforts. Following the arrest of their commander, some Legionnaires swiftly aligned themselves with the government. [GetRulingParty] subsequently reached an agreement with Ähmät Yarullin, the Legion's second leader, who agreed to make concessions, including the disarmament of the Legion and its submission to Härbi Shura's authority."
ttr.26.d2: "$ttr.26.d.intro$\n\nNonetheless, the national military force was insufficient. The legionaries were able to establish full control over Tatar Sloboda, seizing the administrative building in which all members of the government were promptly apprehended. With the collapse of authority in Kazan, the power of the [GetRulingParty] diminished throughout the country. Within other cities, mere days after assuming power, the legionaries either disarmed government forces or co-opted them, compelling them to pledge their allegiance to the Legion." #Legion wins

Following the arrest of their commander, some Legionnaires swiftly aligned themselves with the government. As Milli Idarä failed reached an agreement with Ähmät Yarullin, the Legion's second leader, the Milli Shura's Red Guards quickly moved to arrest him as well, which was a final blow to the Legion's unity. The rest of the Legionaries were forced to disband and some of them have joined the Red Guards. In light of the current situation, the leadership of the Milli Shura declared that the Legion has come under their complete control, leaving the government with no alternative but to acknowledge this fact."

ttr.28.t: "Milli Shura Gets Stronger"
ttr.28.d: "The recent crisis, precipitated by the defiance of the Tatar Legion and their open opposition to the government, saw Ilyas Alkin recognize the pivotal role of the Milli Shura and its Red Guards in achieving this victory. As the voices of dissent grew louder, indicating the government's inability to effectively defend Kazan, Alkin, as the chairman of the Milli Idarä, took decisive action by dismissing the cabinet and replacing them with his supporters from within the Milli Shura. This move effectively rendered the influence of the Turkist faction, once a significant presence within the government, null and void, with the Milli Shura virtually assuming complete control over the governmental apparatus."
ttr.28.a: "They helped to save the Republic."

ttr.29.t: "Turkist Opposition Rally"
ttr.29.d: "Following the demise of the previous administration, Sadri Maksudi and Ğayaz Ishaqi, leaders of the Turkist movement, launched a protest campaign advocating for the rights of the opposition. Their demand was for the immediate convening of a national parliamentary election in the republic, as they believed that Alkin's arbitrary rule had become untenable and it was high time for a government that was truly representative of the people.\n\nHowever, their call for action was not met with support from the Milli Shura faction, who firmly believed that they held the reins of power. They argued that following the coup by the Legions, the government had been weakened, and that Tataria needed unity in the face of existential threats. They warned that opposition rhetoric and an election campaign could easily disrupt this unity.\n\nIf the government were to refuse to hold elections at this juncture, it could lead to widespread protests from the Turkists. However, they doubted their ability to mobilize significant support from among the intelligentsia, merchants, and other influential groups, given the strong backing of Milli Shura among the peasantry and working class."

Regrettably, he addressed the Red Guard congress today, urging them to prevent bourgeois elections in the republic, proclaiming that power should be retained by those who, armed, thwarted the legionaries' coup. It transpired that many of the Red Guards, who had fought against the nationalists in central Kazan, were Muskom sympathizers.\n\nNow we must determine our course of action. Should we permit Soltanğäliev to publicly denounce our constitutional system, it may precipitate another insurrection, this time orchestrated by the Red Guards. It is therefore proposed that we apprehend and detain him forthwith!

In light of Soltanğäliev’s overt assaults on our government and his attempts to destabilize the situation, the government cannot tolerate this any longer, especially after the forces of the Legion have already attempted to seize control. Soltanğäliev was apprehended and detained today and will be brought to trial in connection with his attempted coup.\n\nAlthough the arrest provoked minor resistance from the Red Guards, who attempted to rally in an effort to liberate their leader, Ğalimcan Shäräf intervened personally in the matter, addressing the workers and peasants of the republic.\n\nHe informed them that the authority in the nation now rests with the representatives of the working class and peasantry, the Red Guard soldiers, and this authority is embodied in Milli Shura and Milli Idarä. He reassured them that this was a time for unity against a common adversary who sought to undermine our people from within — and this adversary was the Russian Bolsheviks and other socialist factions who did not wish for the Tatar nation to flourish. Shäräf declared that as long as Milli Shura maintained its grip on power, a true socialist revolution had already occurred, and the Shura would not surrender power to the merchants who desired it. The elections were not an attempt to shift power to Turkish returnees but rather a means of demonstrating to the public that their government was democratically elected, urging them to participate in the voting process."

ttr.32.a: "Another problem solved."

ttr.33.t: "Future of the Parliament"
ttr.33.d: "For many decades, the Tatar people have not had any political representation in the form of distinct Tatar parties. The sole exception to this trend is the Tatar Left SR Party, which has operated illegally for many years. On the contrary, such people as Ilyas Alkin and Sadri Maksudi were long representatives of wider Russian political parties.\n\nTherefore, it is unlikely that parliamentary elections will be conducted on a partisan basis. Rather, candidates will submit lists of names for voters to choose from. This system will result in a Millät Mäjlese that is ostensibly non-partisan, yet it will undoubtedly be divided into factions and groups, with the leftist faction of Milli Shura likely to dominate the proceedings, followed by the right-leaning Turkists.\n\nIn one way or another, it is clear that after the election and the selection of a legitimate leadership, this approach may be altered, given that participants will engage in a vigorous struggle for power, particularly the opposition."
ttr.33.a: "Perhaps the first Tatar political parties will appear soon."

ttr.34.t: "Galiullin's 'Little' Problem"
ttr.34.d: "Several weeks have elapsed since Gabdrakhman Galiullin, a former merchant, assumed the role of head of the Tatar Legion, and while the challenges of his leadership may not have initially appeared insurmountable, they now loom large.\n\nGaliullin is afflicted with a debilitating condition, an addiction that not only undermines his own life but also threatens the well-being of our nation. His alcoholism is a source of concern, coupled with his lack of managerial acumen. While Ähmät Yarullin, his closest ally within the Legion, enjoys the support of young and active legionnaires, Galiullin's faction is comprised primarily of wealthy merchants and intellectuals.\n\nYarullin advocates for immediate reforms aimed at enhancing the prosperity of the nation and bolstering the defensive capabilities of the state, while Galiullin chooses to distance himself by engaging in social gatherings. In the face of a vigilant adversary, the \"Young Guard\" increasingly voices the sentiment that Galiullin should relinquish his position."
ttr.34.a: "We don't need any strife right now."

ttr.35.t: "Shafi Almas and the Kazan Kremlin"
ttr.35.d: "The situation regarding Galiullin’s alcoholism has escalated beyond control. He opted to abandon his given name, adopting a pseudonym and insisting that he be referred to by it. Shafi Almas is our leader’s new moniker, but now he contemplates relocating to the Kazan Kremlin, aiming to establish his government there, all financed by the burgeoning merchant oligarchy.\n\nThis state of affairs cannot be tolerated. The Young Guard intends to oust this drunkard from power while the opportunity still exists. The question arises: should we take this step when our country requires unity and stability."
ttr.35.a: "It shall pass, we require unity."
ttr.35.b: "Evict this inebriated."

ttr.36.t: "Young Guard Takes Power"
ttr.36.d: "Today, the nation was made aware that Shafi Almas, better known as Gabdrakhman Galiullin, had to step down from his position as head of state due to health concerns. His departure left no doubt in anyone's mind that Ähmät Yarullin, leader of the Young Guard, would assume the role of nation's leader for the foreseeable future.\n\nWhile Galiullin now enjoys a well-deserved respite, having accomplished his mission of establishing the Tatar Legion, it is worth noting that much of this success was achieved through the efforts of the younger legionnaires under Yarullin's leadership. With the Legion now united behind a new leader, preparations must begin."
ttr.36.a: "Long live Yarullin!"

ttr.37.t: "Merchants Provide a Compromise"
ttr.37.d: "The attempt to remove Shafi Almas from power was partially successful. First, we have managed to convince the regime's main beneficiaries, merchants and intellectuals, that it is necessary to form a competent government. Secondly, these very beneficiaries of the regime have convinced us that Shafi is a respected figure, despite his illness. Thus, agreements were reached on the sidelines that Shafi Almas would remain the head of state, but nominally and ceremonially, while the main burden would fall on Ähmät Yarullin, who would need to convene a competent and adequate government."
ttr.37.a: "At least, a competent government."

ttr.38.t: "Union of Struggle"
ttr.38.d: "Today, the leadership of the Legion has reached a decision that the organization should remain a purely military movement, with the political leadership of the state being carried out through its representation in the form of a political party — the Union of Struggle.\n\nThis newly formed organization, which enjoys the support of conservative Türkists and financial backing from several prominent Tatar merchant families, will exclusively serve the interests of Idel-Ural, replacing the disciplined Legion, which from now on serves as the General Staff, militia, and national security apparatus."

ttr.101.d: "The enlarged composition of the City Council has convened in Kazan for the first time. The interim administration, Milli Idarä, chaired by Ilyas Alkin, the mayor of Kazan and interim head of the administration, held discussions with other members of the coalition — representatives of Turkists and Milli Shura — on the future of the Tatar Republic. The participants reached an agreement on the need to draft a constitution and address critical and pressing matters, including those related to land, Russian enterprises, and the Tatar Parliament."
ttr.101.a: "Interesting"

ttr.102.t: "The Question of the Land"
ttr.102.d: "One of the primary concerns on the government's agenda is the question of land tenure. The reforms implemented by Russia have not brought about significant alterations in this area. Within the boundaries of Kazan Gubernia, the majority of land is held by the communal peasants, with the Tatar peasantry far from owning the majority. Murzas, Tatar nobility and landlords, also still maintain control over some portions of the land.\n\nThe communal form of land use impedes the advancement of agriculture in the region, as it restricts crop rotation, limits the scope of farming practices, and stifles peasant initiative through the imposition of restrictions on land use. The Stolypin reforms only reinforced communal ownership of land, and Russia's transformations failed to make any impact on this aspect.\n\nIn light of this development, Milli Idarä was, naturally, unable to arrive at a unified decision, as delegates from various factions espoused divergent approaches to addressing the current predicament. While some advocated for the socialization or nationalization of land, others proposed the forcible expropriation of land from Russian owners and its allocation to the Tatar community."
ttr.102.a: "A single solution was not reached"

ttr.103.t: "Nationalization of Russian Enterprises"
ttr.103.d: "One of the most important issues is the fate of Russian enterprises located on our territory. Despite the fact that many delegates insist on the immediate nationalization of all Russian companies, their future fate does not find unity in opinions. Some, mainly the Turkists, propose to privatize these companies, distributing them to rich Tatar merchants and burghers. The others suggested to nationalize Russian enterprises, same as any other enterprise in the republic. Finally, there were also those, who demanded workers' control of any plants and factories."
ttr.103.a: "A single solution was not reached"

ttr.104.t: "The Tatar Parliament"
ttr.104.d: "The protracted debates within the government, which have been ongoing for several weeks, are only serving to exacerbate the situation, a fact that is widely acknowledged. The necessity of convening a Tatar parliament in order to elect a legitimate government becomes increasingly apparent. The Turkist faction, convinced of their ability to prevail in the parliamentary contest, is particularly ardent in advocating for this course of action. However, not all are in full support of this proposal. Some maintain that the Tatars require a strong leadership to guide them without the complications of parliamentary discourse, while others argue that elections are not the priority at this juncture, and that unity is essential in the Tatars' existential struggle. Regardless of the perspective, a decision must be made regarding the timing of the assembly of the people's representatives."

This congress brought together delegates from various regions such as Crimea, the North and Transcaucasus, Kazan, the Urals, Turkestan, and Siberia, with the aim of discussing the organisational structure of the Muslim movement.\n\nThe congress saw the triumph of moderate views, leading to the decision to establish a Muslim union rather than a political party. The objectives of the Ittifaq were to unite Russian Muslims under a common banner, establish a constitutional monarchy based on proportional representation for different ethnic groups, ensure legal equality between Muslim and non-Muslim populations, abolish laws and policies that discriminated against Muslims, and promote the development of Muslim culture and education.. The Union had branches in various regions of Russia, including the Volga area, Crimea, the Ural mountains, the Caucasus region, Siberia, Turkestan, and Transcaucasia. However, due to the onset of the Stolypin reaction in July 1907, the Ittifaq effectively disintegrated on its own accord.\n\nRecently, the Turkist movement has announced the revival of the union and its transformation into a formal organization representing all Muslims, with Sadri Maksudi and Ğayaz Ishaqi leading the way. While the establishment of regional branches remains a distant prospect given the dissolution of the Russian Empire, it represents a positive development for the Muslim community."
ttr.109.a: "The Muslims, unite."

ttr.110.t: "The Labor Party"
ttr.110.d: "Following the adoption of the new constitution, the proposal for a Soviet-style government put forward by some members of the Milli Shura was dismissed. In essence, the existence of the Milli Shura became unconstitutional, leading to the decision to establish a party in its stead.\n\nToday, Ilyas Alkin and Ğalimcan Shäräf convened a founding congress in Kazan, during which they announced the establishment of the Muslim Labor Party. This party serves as the ideological heir to the \"Muslim labour group\" within the Second State Duma of the Russian Empire, representing the left-leaning core of Tatarists, Territorists, and Jadidists. Thus, the left-oriented political figures in Idel-Ural now have their own party with a clear agenda."
ttr.110.d2: "$ttr.110.d$\n\nThe Ufa wing of Milli Shura opposed this decision and declared that they will not join this 'bourgeois' party, instead sticking to their Left SR Party."
ttr.110.a: "Great!"

ttr.111.t: "Alliance With [FROM.GetName]?"
ttr.111.d: "The representatives from [FROM.GetNameDef] have recently proposed a joint front with us against [RUS.GetNameDef] as they believe we will recognize their government and their right for self-determination. How shall we answer?"
ttr.111.a: "We need allies now!"
ttr.111.b: "No way!"

ttr.112.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
ttr.112.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government has refused our friendly offer and we will have to fight on our own."
ttr.112.a: "They all just want Greater Russia, that's it."

ttr.113.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agreed!"
ttr.113.d: "Luckily, the government of [FROM.GetName] and [FROM.GetLeader] personally have accepted our request for an alliance against the [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government. They have recognized our independence and our right for self-determination."
ttr.113.a: "Great!"

ttr.201.t: "Proclamation of Idel-Ural State"
ttr.201.d: "United with the Bashkir National Government, the coalition of nationalist parties of Tatarstan and Bashkurdistan declares the state sovereignty of the Volga-Ural State. By uniting all the Turkic-speaking and other small peoples of the Volga region, we will finally throw off the shackles of Russian domination!"
ttr.201.a: "Long Live the Idel-Ural!"

ttr.202.t: "Tensions Between I-UMB and I-UTMAB"
ttr.202.d: "Despite the initial agreements, there were some contradictions between the delegations of the congress of Idel-Ural Muslim organizations from the Bashkirs and Tatars. Disagreements began from the most insignificant, such as the choice of the state's capital, to the most important - who will become the President of the new state, and how the government will be formed.\n\nThe disagreements resulted in mutual insults and ended in mass riots. Divisions of the Bashkir National Army and detachments of Tatar Legionaries approached the building where the congress was held, and a scuffle broke out between them. To get out of this situation, it is necessary to find a compromise, otherwise there is a risk that the country will fall into a state of civil war.\n\nThe leader of the Tatar Legionaries, Ähmät Yarullin, recalled the divisions to preserve peace and security, and Galimyan Tagan, the leader of the Bashkir Military Council, followed suit. It seems that the parties began to listen to each other and look for compromises, when suddenly it became known that the leader of I-UTMAB Shafi Almas declared the illegitimacy of the congress and, together with his loyal legionnaires, went to storm the Kazan Kremlin"
ttr.202.a: "We shall stop the madman!"

tatsoc.1.t: "The National Council"
tatsoc.1.d: "The proliferation of various Soviets at various levels preceding the outbreak of civil war in Russia did not bypass Tatar lands. Local councils of peasants’ deputies, workers’ councils, factory committees and other forms of civic self-organisation flourished, and socialist views predominated in them.\n\nLast week, congresses of Tatar councils were held both in Kazan and Ufa, the latter still under the control of Russian Red Guards. These congresses decided to establish a National Council (Milli Shura) aimed at uniting all Tatar peasants and workers. However, the council has not yet formulated its position on the revolution.\n\nIt is worth noting that in Ufa the left SR Ğälimcan Ibrahimov gained the upper hand, albeit not openly. Throughout the years, he remained an unacknowledged representative of the Tatar Left SR movement, which strongly supports the Revolution and the Soviet government in Petrograd.\n\nIn Kazan, the supporters of Ilyas Alkin triumphed under the guidance of his long-time comrade, Ğalimcan Shäräf. This faction is closely aligned with the right SRs, who thus far have not supported any of the purported Russian “governments”, but rather aim to assert their influence within the Tatar Republic.\n\nWhile Milli Shura may appear to be a unified entity, the majority within it is currently dominated by Kazan socialists. And Ufa, which is not under the control of Ibrahimov, is embroiled in a struggle that could divert his attention away from the situation for an extended period."
tatsoc.1.a: "We must keep our eyes open."

tatsoc.2.t: "The Muslim Socialist Committee"
tatsoc.2.d: "Despite the apparent consolidation of socialist forces under the banner of Milli Shura, there remain those who refuse to be part of this movement. In Kazan today, a congress of the resurgent Muslim Socialist Committee took place, featuring none other than Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev — a fugitive Bolshevik who has clearly returned from his exile within the French Commune.\n\nTo the Tatar people, Soltanğäliev is primarily remembered as a Bolshevik, the mastermind behind the Kazan revolution, and an ardent opponent of the Idel-Ural State, whose efforts arguably contributed significantly to the failure of our nascent nation. To many, he represents a traitor, one who ultimately undermined the national aspirations of the Tatar people.\n\nNonetheless, during his years of exile, Soltanğäliev also gained notoriety for his ideological stance as an advocate of Islamic Marxist socialism. He actively opposed the preservation of Tatarstan as an autonomous region, advocating for the overthrow of the Russian government, which had extinguished the hopes of the Turko-Tatar people for genuine independence and equality with Russia.\n\nThis stance rendered him an outcast within the European socialist movement, being rejected both by his former Bolshevik comrades and the current authorities in Petrograd. However, among the Tatar community, there remains a belief in Soltanğäliev's vision, which challenges collective Europe and Western colonial Marxism that purports to liberate all peoples. Perhaps, his ideas on the independence of a socialist East will continue to resonate."
tatsoc.2.a: "We must watch him closely."

tatsoc.3.t: "Ufa Milli Shura Asks For Aid"
tatsoc.3.d: "The ongoing preparations for the siege of Ufa by Bashkir nationalist forces in a city predominantly populated by Tatars raise concerns. Our relationship with the Bashkir leader, [BKN.GetLeader], cannot be described as friendly or even cooperative, as their nationalism confronts our own desire for unity of all Turko-Tatars.\n\nIn light of the impending defense of Ufa, the local branch of Milli Shuro, led by Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, has sought assistance. However, they lack a majority in the city Soviet, with Bashkirs and their party, Irek, effectively holding the reins of power through the bayonets of the Red Guard forces.\n\nOn the one hand, should we lend assistance to Ibrahimov, it would undoubtedly garner the support of the Tatar community in the Ufa region, potentially allowing us to counter the influence of Bashkir nationalist elements within Ufa. However, it is crucial to note that the city remains under the jurisdiction of Russian authorities, and such an alliance may be met with disapproval by various political factions within the Tatar Republic, potentially even legitimizing the Petrograd Government, which remains a source of contention for us. The time has come to make a decision regarding the future of Ufa, one that may well impact the collective destiny of the entire Tatar nation."
tatsoc.3.a: "Do not let the Bashkir nationalists win!"
tatsoc.3.b: "No support for the pro-Russian forces!"

# Fall of Ufa - no support for Ibrahimov
tatsoc.4.t: "Fall of Ufa!"
tatsoc.4.d: "Following the defeat in the Battle of Ufa, the city came under the complete control of the Bashkir nationalist administration of [BKN.GetLeader]. Due to their harsh anti-socialist rhetoric, the representatives of the Ufa Milli Shura fled the city and relocated to Kazan."
tatsoc.4.d2: "$tatsoc.4.d$\n\nDespite the loss of major support base, Ibrahimov delivered a fiery speech in Kazan, criticizing the government and announcing his withdrawal from the Milli Shura. He accused the government of abandoning millions of Tatars in the Ufa region to their fate by not supporting the Milli Shura's efforts in Ufa.\n\nHis speech garnered significant attention and support from those seeking the unification of the Tatar people. In response to these developments, Ibrahimov declared that the Tatar Left SR Party rejects Milli Idarä and Milli Shura, forming a coalition with the Muslim Socialist Committee to oppose the current government."
tatsoc.4.a: "Unbelievable!"

# Fall of Ufa - support for Ibrahimov
tatsoc.5.d: "Following the defeat in the Battle of Ufa, the city came under the complete control of the Bashkir nationalist administration of [BKN.GetLeader]. Due to their harsh anti-socialist rhetoric, the representatives of the Ufa Milli Shura fled the city and relocated to Kazan.\n\nDespite the loss of major support base, Ibrahimov delivered a fiery speech in Kazan, criticizing the Bashkir government, and in hope to gain support from the Kazan population.\n\nHis speech garnered significant attention and support from those seeking the unification of the Tatar people."
tatsoc.5.a: "Tatars will overwhelm!"

# Ufa wins - no support for Ibrahimov
tatsoc.6.t: "Battle of Ufa Won!"
tatsoc.6.d: "Following a prolonged siege of Ufa, the Bashkir nationalists withdrew, unable to assert control over the city. The city is celebrating its victory, with the Ufa branch of Milli Shura and its leader, Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, garnering substantial support among the Tatar populace, significantly contributing to this triumph."
tatsoc.6.d2: "$tatsoc.6.d$\n\nBut it played a cunning trick on us. On the meeting in Ufa, Ibrahimov leveled a scathing accusation against our government for failing to provide assistance to the Tatar community in Ufa. He declared the severing of all ties with the Milli Shura and the Milli Idarä and pledged unwavering support for the Petrograd administration."

# Ufa wins - support for Ibrahimov
tatsoc.7.d: "Following a prolonged siege of Ufa, the Bashkir nationalists withdrew, unable to assert control over the city. The city is celebrating its victory, with the Ufa branch of Milli Shura and its leader, Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, garnering substantial support among the Tatar populace, significantly contributing to this triumph.\n\nWhile the struggle for dominance in Ufa continues, it is clear that Ğälimcan's ambitions for dominating the city have been thwarted. The triumph in Ufa has further bolstered the position of the Ufa faction of Milli Shura, although they still fall short of achieving full influence not only within the Tatar Republic but also within the city itself. Nevertheless, the recognition of the authority of the Petrograd government is gaining increasing momentum."

tatsoc.8.t: "Tatar Milli Idarä Supports Ufa Defenders!"
tatsoc.8.d: "We have received information that the government of [TTR.GetName] has extended its support to the local Tatar community in Ufa, specifically represented by Ğälimcan Ibrahimov, a member of the Ufa Soviet and a supporter of the Tatar socialist revolutionary movement. Despite the fact that the Tatar socialists do not currently hold a majority position in the Soviet, and power is currently concentrated in the hands of Bashkir socialists, this act of support serves as a clear indication of the ambitious aspirations of the Tatar government, particularly in relation to their territorial claims in our ancestral homeland."
tatsoc.8.a: "They are traitors of their own people!"

tatsoc.9.t: "Fractured Allegiance of the Red Guards"
tatsoc.9.d: "The paramilitary arm of the Milli Shura — the Red Guard — has proven to be less steadfast in its ideological commitment to either the government or the leadership of Ğalimcan Shäräf. Due to the increasing influence of Muskom's and Soltanğäliev's propaganda, many members of the Red Guard are openly or covertly aligning themselves with the latter's call for revolution.\n\nIn the absence of political commissars to weed out disloyal elements and hold them accountable, the influence of Soltanğäliev and the Muskom is on the rise, posing a growing threat to our government. The effects of this growing influence must be taken into consideration as they continue to spread."
tatsoc.9.a: "A sad development."

tatsoc.10.t: "Clashes Between Tatars and Bashkirs"
tatsoc.10.d.intro: "Although it may appear that both Tatars and Bashkirs have chosen to take secessionist measures by distancing themselves from Russia, such an interpretation is a significant oversimplification of the situation. Within the Tatar-Bashkir socialist movement, there exists a profound division between those who support the Revolution and those who advocate for secession from Russia.\n\nWhile Tatar nationalists currently hold sway in Kazan, and Bashkir nationalists dominate the Southern Urals, Ufa witnesses a genuine conflict, despite our dominance over the city."
tatsoc.10.d: "$tatsoc.10.d.intro$ With a narrow majority of votes, the Ufa Soviet was able to chose Sharif Manatov, a popular socialist in Ufa, as its chairman. However, due to the fact that the majority of the region's population are Tatars, they do not welcome the leadership of a Bashkir nationalist. And Manatov's loyalty to our government also leaves much to be desired.$tatsoc.10.d.end$"
tatsoc.10.d2: "$tatsoc.10.d.intro$ With a narrow majority of votes, the Ufa Soviet was able to chose Shahit Hozaybirzin, a Bolshevik loyal to the government, as chairman. However, despite the fact that most of the Gubernia's population is Tatar, he is not particularly popular among either Tatars or Bashkirs.$tatsoc.10.d.end$"
tatsoc.10.d.end: "\n\nThe main opposition to Hozaybirzin's leadership comes from the Tatar Left SRs, who are our trusted allies led by Galimyan Ibragimov. The Left SRs in government advocate for the immediate transfer of power in the Ufa Gubernia to Ibragimov, which would allow him to annex Ufa to the Tatar republic. This move would give him significant advantages in his struggle for power and potentially lead to a successful revolution in Kazan. However, representatives from other parties argue that while Ibragimov can be trusted, there is no guarantee of his success in Kazan."
tatsoc.10.a: "Cheat - the SRs should have power in Ufa."
tatsoc.10.b: "We will crush Kazan nationalists first!"

tatsoc.11.t: "Simonov Rifles and Soviet Rubles"
tatsoc.11.d: "According to our intelligence reports, the Left SR forces are preparing a coup... Our troops are insufficient to secure all borders, moreover, the borders are not recognized, and we are almost completely surrounded by the Petrograd authorities and their Red Army, who periodically launch raids on vulnerable villages. It is therefore not surprising that poaching and illicit arms trafficking are thriving in the republic, and Soviet agents are infiltrating our cities.\n\nIt has come to our attention that the Central Committee of the Tatar Left SR party has recently received several million rubles from the Petrograd authorities, as well as multiple trucks laden with Simonov rifles. There is every indication that Ibrahimov is planning a revolution, but who will implement it, and more importantly, who is backing him, remains unclear.\n\nCertain of our advisors advocate for exerting pressure on the Milli Shura in order to intensify agitation among the working class and peasantry in support of our government. Conversely, a more radical faction of advisors maintains that Shäräf and the socialists should be kept under surveillance."
tatsoc.11.a: "Pressure Milli Shura."
tatsoc.11.b: "Reinforce our allies in Milli Shura."

tatsoc.12.t: "Kazan Soviet Workers'-Peasants' Republic"
tatsoc.12.d: "In January 1918, the Kazan Soviet of Workers', Peasants' and Soldiers' Deputies decided to take decisive measures to combat our national aspirations. In order to counteract the establishment of the Idel-Ural State, the Kazan Soviet resolved to convene a congress of Soviets of the Volga region and the Urals. However, the Congress adopted a resolution regarding the self-determination of the region's peoples in the form of a Volga-Ural Soviet republic.\n\nUndaunted by the decision of this congress, which they themselves had convened, the Kazan Soviet proceeded to establish the Kazan Soviet Workers'-Peasants' Republic, defying the very principles of self-determination. Following the agreement of the constituent parties, state structures for the republic were established, with Yakov Sheinkman elected as the chair of the Council of People's Commissars, despite his non-Tatar ethnicity.\n\nFollowing the promulgation of the regulations pertaining to the Tatar–Bashkir Soviet Socialist Republic in the month of March 1918, and a ban on the operations of all-Muslim organisations, Kazan Soviet Republic ceased to be relevant. The leaders of the Kazan Soviet failed to comprehend the fundamental principles of Russian governance and rejected the concept of federalism, instead seeking to replace the vision of the Idel–Ural state with a non-national idea — the Kazan Soviet Workers'-Peasants' Republic, which remained purely on paper.\n\nOn May 16th, 1918, the Kazan Soviet Republic officially ceased to exist through a decision made by the Executive Committee of the Kazan Gubernia Soviet due to "no soviet authority had declared the establishment of such a republic". Its powers were then transferred to the Kazan Soviet. Finally, after the liberation of Kazan by the People's Army of the Komuch, Yakov Sheinkman, a prominent figure, met his demise."
tatsoc.12.a: "The very name offends the Tatars."

tatsoc.13.t: "The New Bolgar Commune"
tatsoc.13.d: "A new movement has gained particular popularity among Tatar farmers in recent times. Its epicentre is the village of New Bolgar in the Chistopolsky region of Tatarstan. While the movement itself may not be entirely novel, it traces its origins back to the 19th century, with Bahavetdin Wäisi serving as its ideological progenitor and founder. A follower of the Naqshbandi Sufi tradition, Bahavetdin met his demise at the hands of Tsarist authorities in a psychiatric institution.\n\nFollowing Bahavetdin, Ğaynan Wäisi assumed leadership of the movement, a prominent figure during the Civil War. Upon his passing, he established the village of New Bolgar. Under his leadership, the movement's peasant-based ideology, rooted in strong religious beliefs, has been actively propagated. They align themselves with Socialist ideals, including those espoused by Muskom. However, can we fully place our trust in them?"
tatsoc.13.a: "We need all possible allies!"
tatsoc.13.b: "A pack of idiots and heretics, let us not concern ourselves with them!"

tatsoc.14.t: "Coup of the Muskom"
tatsoc.14.d: "Following the elections, tensions remained high, particularly due to Muskom's active campaign against the electoral process. In several regions, the voting process was disrupted, providing Muskom's supporters with arguments against the newly elected parliament. Today, a large protest rally was held in Kazan, organized by Red Guards and working-class citizens, who called for a vote of no confidence against the parliament and its leadership. Efforts to quell the unrest proved ineffective.\n\nIn the late hours of the evening, civil unrest erupted. The authorities attempted to rally the populace in their support, but to no avail. Enraged laborers set ablaze merchant establishments, plunging the heart of Kazan into further turmoil. By dawn, the mob had decided to assault the administrative building, ultimately succeeding in their endeavor. Despite the absence of the prime minister, who had fled in advance, this development only served to bolster Muskom's position.\n\nSoltanğäliev, addressing the throng in the central plaza, declared that the unlawfully elected government had been ousted. At a hastily convened congress of the \"Kazan Soviet\", it was promptly announced that the previous government had been removed from power, and authority had been vested in the representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Soltanğäliev was elected as chairman of the \"All-Tatar Soviet\".\n\nDespite the turmoil and carnage, the coup has been successful, the revolution has been accomplished. While there is still some dissent against the newly established socialist government, there is no doubt that the entire nation will soon fall under its control."
tatsoc.14.a: "Long live the workers and peasant of Tatarstan!"

tatsoc.15.t: "Coup of the Muskom"
tatsoc.15.d: "Following the assumption of power by the Tatar Legion, tensions remained heightened, particularly due to the activities of Muskom, a group that challenged the authority of the Legion. In certain regions, the influence of the Legion was not as strong, providing an opportunity for Muskom supporters to attempt a revolutionary takeover.\n\nGathering their loyal followers, the leadership of Muskom declared an insurrection. The socialist uprising swiftly spread throughout the republic, leading to civil unrest in Kazan later in the evening. Violent clashes ensued between Legionnaires and insurgents, but when workers from the Kazan Powder Factory aligned with the latter, the tide of battle shifted decisively in their favor. By dawn, Galliulin and Yarullin, leaders of the insurgency, were apprehended, and upon the dissemination of this news across the region, many legionnaires chose to surrender.\n\nSoltanğäliev, addressing the throng in the central plaza, proclaimed that the illegitimate rule of the Legion had been toppled. At a hastily convened congress of the \"Kazan Soviet\", it was promptly announced that the previous government had been removed from power, and authority had been vested in the representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers. Soltanğäliev was elected as chairman of the \"All-Tatar Soviet\".\n\nDespite the turmoil and carnage, the coup has been successful, the revolution has been accomplished.

tatsoc.15.a: "Long live the workers and peasant of Tatarstan!"

tatsoc.16.t: "Coup of the Milli Shura"
tatsoc.16.d: "Following the elections, tensions remained high, particularly due to Milli Shura's large influence within the Red Guards. As [GetLeader] assumed control, the Red Guards refused to acknowledge his legitimacy, and Ğalimcan Shäräf decided to act against the government. Today, a large protest rally was held in Kazan, organized by Red Guards and working-class citizens, who called for a vote of no confidence against the parliament and its leadership. Efforts to quell the unrest proved ineffective.\n\nIn the late hours of the evening, civil unrest erupted. The authorities attempted to rally the populace in their support, but to no avail.

By dawn, the mob had decided to assault the administrative building, ultimately succeeding in their endeavor. Despite the absence of the prime minister, who had fled in advance, this development only served to bolster Muskom's position.\n\nShäräf, addressing the throng in the central plaza, declared that the unlawfully elected government had been ousted. As a leader of Milli Shura, he announced that the previous government had been removed from power, and authority had been vested in the representatives of workers, peasants, and soldiers, embodied in Milli Shura.\n\nDespite the turmoil and carnage, the coup has been successful, the revolution has been accomplished. While there is still some dissent against the newly established socialist government, there is no doubt that the entire nation will soon fall under its control."

tatsoc.17.t: "Question of the Leadership"
tatsoc.17.d: "With Milli Shura now firmly in the driver's seat, the Ufa branch of the party under the leadership of Ibrahimov has convened an extraordinary congress. The Left SRs, primarily represented by Ufa faction, have advocated for the selection of a new party executive committee, a move that could have far-reaching consequences for the nation's future if the Ufa faction prevails.\n\nDelegates from across Milli Shura's regional councils attended the congress, and following the initial speeches from the candidates, the voting commenced..."

tatsoc.19.d2: "$tatsoc.19.d$\n\nOn the one hand, we rejoice at the addition of another brotherly nation to our common struggle. However, on the other, there are concerns among the leadership, particularly among the Left SRs, regarding the reliability of Sultangaliev.

A more trustworthy option would be Galimyan Ibragimov, leader of the Tatar Left SRs from the Ufa branch of the Tatar National Soviet (Milli Shura).

tatsoc.23.t: "Sultangaliev's Growing Ambitions"
tatsoc.23.d: "Since the dawn of the century, Tatar nationalist and socialist movements have advocated for the unification of all Volga Turkic and Tatar peoples under a single federal state. During the revolutionary period, the nationalist bourgeoisie attempted to establish such a state known as Idel-Ural, but it was ultimately unsuccessful, leaving the stage open for even more unprecedented proposals.\n\nMirsaid Sultangaliev, the leader of [TTR.GetNameDef], has long espoused pan-Turkic ideology and other unsubstantiated notions, which clearly contradicts our national policies. We uphold the sovereignty of all nations, particularly the oppressed peoples of the East, but Sultangaliev's rhetoric is becoming increasingly ambitious.\n\nLast week, in Kazan, the [TTR.GetRulingParty] congress convened, at which Sultangaliev delivered a speech. From the podium, he formally addressed our government with a suggestion to unite all \"Turko-Tatar\" peoples into a single federal Soviet republic — the Republic of Turan.\n\nOn the one hand, such a move would satisfy the pan-Turkic aspirations of the majority of Central Asian and Volga region populations. However, on the other hand, it would create a potent autonomous entity that could potentially challenge our authority."

tatsoc.28.t: "Recognition of [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Government?"
tatsoc.28.d: "Now that power in the Idel-Ural has definitively passed into the hands of the working people, Milli Shura deems it imperative to raise the question of recognizing the [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] government as the sole legitimate government of all of Russia.\n\n[ROOT.GetLeader], while cautious about this, as he fears that Russia may suppress the Tatar national movement by blending it with the all-Russian socialist one, sees no alternative — at least at present, without Russia the fate of the Turko-Tatars is in limbo, and there is no other way forward."

tatsoc.31.d: "With the fall of Ufa to the hands of [FROM.GetAdjective] revolutionaries, their leader, Galimyan Ibragimov has once again raised the question of formation of the Volga-Ural Soviet Republic, a unified autonomy of Tatars and Turkic peoples of Inner Russia. If we agree to their proposal, we will hand them over all those lands. However, some of our advisors suggest that a better idea would be to create a Tataro-Bashkir Soviet Republic instead, or even more - end all these nationalist and Pan-Turkic ambitions and force separate autonomies for each of these states."

tatsoc.32.t: "Russia Cancels the Idel-Ural Project"
tatsoc.32.d: "The Russian government has categorically dismissed our proposal to establish the Idel-Ural Republic. State functionaries and party officials in Moscow maintain that such a political entity is impracticable, and have demanded that we relinquish our \"bourgeois\" aspirations. Nonetheless, it is clear that Moscow is pursuing the path of establishing separate autonomous entities for each nationality, and they have no interest in our input." #Separate Tatar and Bashkir
tatsoc.32.d2: "The Russian government has categorically dismissed our proposal for an Idel-Ural republic. The bureaucrats and party officials in [FROM.Capital.GetName] maintain that such a political entity is unfeasible, and have instead demanded an alternative — the establishment of a Tatar–Bashkir Soviet republic, a Soltanğäliev’s concept that was practically abandoned in 1918. If we were to accept this course of action, we would have to share power with Bashkirs." #Tataro-Bashkir

tatsoc.39.t: "Ğaynan Wäisi Challenges [ROOT.GetLeader]"
tatsoc.39.d: "An intriguing situation arose at a congress of the council in Kazan. Ğaynan Wäisi, a prominent figure in the \"revolutionary-Bulgarist-Islamic-communist\" movement, found himself on the periphery of his own sect, save for the immense support he received from the religious peasants. Now, Wäisi aspires to assume the position of chairman, following the substantial backing he has garnered for his «Fırqa-i-Nadjiya» from the Soviet authorities.\n\nThe local councils, however, convened a congress in order to elect Wäisi as the new leader of the [ROOT.GetAdjective] Soviet. At the congress, he intends to unveil his program, proclaiming that his \"Party of the Survivors\" aims to collaborate closely with the All-Russian authorities in [RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Surprisingly, many Russian officials seem to favour cooperation with this religious zealot over [ROOT.GetLeader]!"
tatsoc.39.a: "Unexpectedly, the congress votes for Wäisi!"
tatsoc.39.b: "This individual failed to garner even the bare minimum of support."

tatsoc.40.t: "New Leadership in [FROM.GetName]"
tatsoc.40.d: "Yesterday, another congress took place in [FROM.GetNameDef], convened at the initiative of peasant soviets in the region, particularly the \"New Bulgaria\" commune and its leader, Gainan Vaisov. Much to the surprise of the former leadership of the republic, Vaisov and his \"Group of Survivors\" managed to gain the upper hand, securing the majority of votes from delegates. As a result, Vaisov emerged as the new chairman, effectively ousting such heavyweights as Galimyan Ibragimov from positions of power in the [FROM.GetAdjective] Soviet.\n\nWhile some in our government celebrate the fact that an inept leadership has assumed power in [FROM.GetName], anticipating their failure and employing it as an excuse to establish their own loyal administration, others, conversely, anticipate greater success from Vaisovites than from the prior leadership."
tatsoc.40.a: "What the hell?!"

tatsoc.41.t: "The Tatar Green Movement"
tatsoc.41.d: "The Green movement has traditionally been associated with peasants and their field atamans, and after the conclusion of the civil war, it merged with the people's revolutionary movement under the leadership of Boris Savinkov. However, in the Tatar region, the Green movement evolves according to its unique dynamics.\n\nThe founder and ideological instigator of the Tatar peasant militant movement known as the Green Army was Bahavetdin Wäisi, an adherent of the Naqshbandi Sufi order. In 1826, he established the «house of prayer and militant study of the Holy God's troops» in Kazan. Wäisi styled himself «sardar» (commander) and his followers The Group of Survivors.\n\nThe Wäisi movement rejected the tsarist administration, court, taxation, conscription, and the clerics who supported autocracy. They advocated for the restoration of Volga Bulgaria. Wäisi primarily represented the interests of peasants, so the tenets of their doctrine resonated with the common people, who endured severe oppression by the tsarist regime, protesting against autocratic oppression and the bureaucratic apparatus.\n\nIn the 1880s and 1890s, Wäisi led peasant uprisings in the Kazan region, however Bahavetdin Wäisi was confined to the Kazan District Psychiatric Hospital, where he passed away in 1893. Under his leadership, the movement initially had a predominantly religious focus, but upon the arrival of Ğaynan Wäisi as his successor, it also began to manifest political activism.\n\nDuring the tumultuous period of the Civil War, Ğaynan Wäisi emerged as a prominent figure, leading the green movement and establishing collaboration with the Kazan Soviet, which even provided them with arms. This trend continues to this day, with the Wäisi movement exerting a profound influence on the peasantry across our nation."
tatsoc.41.a: "We need peasants on our side."

tatsoc.42.t: "Green Army of [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
tatsoc.42.d: "The green movement among Tatar peasants, which has gained momentum in recent months under the guidance of Ğaynan Wäisi, continues to gain strength. Even some members of the Red Guards have begun to align themselves with the green movement, attracted by the increased autonomy within the already decentralized structure of the Red Guard.\n\nThis shift is particularly notable among peasants who have been marginalized for many years and have not found common ground with either the clergy of the previous republican government or the more conservative mullahs. The green movement is growing stronger by the day, and local peasant councils have now demanded that the Green Army — the warriors of Allah — be recognized as equal to the Red Guard and that their field commanders be admitted to the general staff."
tatsoc.42.a: "Allow this formation."
tatsoc.42.b: "No way!"

tatsoc.43.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks For Help!"
tatsoc.43.d: "Recently, in Kazan, a city that had recently been under the influence of pro-[RUS.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] socialist forces, there has been a coup d'état led by the 'Group of Survivors', a Tatar national-revolutionary Green Armies' party. While their ideology may be quite distant from the ideal vision espoused by our leader, there are nevertheless many similarities between our goals — our commitment to the ideals of peasant self-government and the struggle for peasant rights.\n\nOur leader, Boris Savinkov, fondly recalls his role at the helm of the SZRS (Union for the Defence of the Motherland and Liberty), fighting for the liberation of Kazan Gubernia's peasants during the battles for Sviyazhsk. We may consider providing assistance to these revolutionaries, but they demand guarantees of autonomy and recognition for their aspired state, the Volga Bulgaria People's Republic."
tatsoc.43.a: "All Green armies should be on one side."
tatsoc.43.b: "We may have something in common, but they are crazy, aren't they?"

tatsoc.44.t: "The Green Army Coup"
tatsoc.44.d: "The decision not to form separate divisions of the Green Army within our armed forces provoked genuine outrage among the peasants, resulting in widespread unrest and violent protests across the province. The peasants refused to pay taxes as they had done in tsarist times and demanded the establishment of an Islamic government that would genuinely represent their interests.\n\nOur leadership was alarmed by these developments, and our leader called for the immediate arrest of Ğaynan Wäisi. However, during an attempted arrest, several Red Guards sided with the enemy. Soon after, riots erupted in Kazan and throughout the republic, with many who had previously been loyal to the Tatar Legion switching their allegiance to Wäisi.\n\nBy dawn, Kazan had been taken over by insurgent forces, with the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] leadership being apprehended. A new Congress of Tatar Peasant Soviets and the Green Army Soldiers was convened, electing Wäisi as its chair. While the previous administration has been ousted, it is important to consider how [RUS.Capital.GetName] might respond to this development."
tatsoc.44.a: "Long live our Sardar!"

tatsoc.45.t: "Green Army Coup in [FROM.GetName]"
tatsoc.45.d: "Alarming reports are arriving from Kazan, where the Green Army, under the leadership of Gainan Vaisov, has seized control of [FROM.GetNameDef]. Vaisov claims to be a Sardar, or commander, and he leads a group of followers who identify as religious, fundamentalist, and revolutionary, while also claiming to be socialist. The movement was founded by Vaisov's father, Bahavetdin, a leader of peasant revolts in the 1870s who opposed the tsarist regime.\n\nNow, Vaisov, having come to power through a coup, was nonetheless formally elected at the Tatar Congress of Peasant and Green Army Soviets. The question arises: what should be done with this marginal movement that has suddenly gained widespread support? Should we recognize Vaisov while the opportunity presents itself and grant him the authority to lead [FROM.GetNameDef], or should we suppress the dissidents with ruthless force and eradicate this inherently counter-revolutionary movement?"
tatsoc.45.a: "We'd better have them as our allies."
tatsoc.45.b: "What the hell? Crush this regime!"

tatsoc.46.t: "Russia Mobilizes Against Us!"
tatsoc.46.d: "The Russian occupation administration has manifested an unwillingness to acknowledge our sovereignty, and is poised to launch an assault on our urban centers with the intention of imposing its puppet regime, akin to the one established in 1918 through the Kazan Soviet Republic. It is imperative that we take up arms in defense of our nation's autonomy. Should the Russians persist in their refusal to acknowledge our authority, we shall not acquiesce to their long-standing dominance."
tatsoc.46.a: "Resist those imperialists!"
tatsoc.46.b: "Initiate talks with the Russian Revolutionary Front!"

tatsoc.47.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Offers Help!"
tatsoc.47.d: "Our delegation was accepted in the headquarters of the Russian Revolutionary Front. Their leader, [FROM.GetLeader] has offered us help in our common struggle against [RUS.GetName]."
tatsoc.47.a: "Glory to the Sardar and the Vozhd!"

tatsoc.48.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused"
tatsoc.48.d: "Unfortunately, the government of [FROM.GetName] has refused to help us, despite our common peasant orientation."

tatsoc.49.d: "Today, the Russian government has officially recognized our glorious [ROOT.GetLeader] as the legitimate leader of [ROOT.GetName]."
tatsoc.49.a: "Great!"

tatsoc.50.t: "Tatar Resistance!"
tatsoc.50.d: "Despite our best efforts, these religious fanatics from [FROM.GetName] have refused to respect the will of the Russia's workers and peasants. They are equally deaf to the demands of Tatar proletarians."
tatsoc.50.a: "We shall crush these lunatics!"

tatsoc.51.t: "[FROM.GetName] Gives Us Ufa!"
tatsoc.51.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has decided, as previously negotiated, to give us the city of Ufa and its province - and with it, a lot of ethnic Tatars will finally join [ROOT.GetNameDef]."
tatsoc.51.a: "Great!"

tatsoc.52.t: "[FROM.GetName] Asks for Ufa"
tatsoc.52.d: "Yesterday, the government of [FROM.GetNameDef] has asked us for their claim on the Ufa Gubernia. While almost half of the city's population is Tatar, it is almost equally populated by the Bashkirs, and some of our advisers suggest that transferring Ufa to Tatars would alienate most of Bashkir workers and peasants from us. On the other hand, we are much more confident in the government of Tataria."
tatsoc.52.a: "We shall give them what they want."
tatsoc.52.b: "We'd better leave Ufa in the hands of Bashkirs!"

tatsoc.53.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
tatsoc.53.d: "Unfortunately, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government has rejected our fair and honest request to transfer Ufa to [ROOT.GetNameDef]"
tatsoc.53.a: "We have to accept it."
tatsoc.53.b: "They have truly betrayed the Tatars."

tatsoc.54.t: "Tatar Revolutionaries in Ufa!"
tatsoc.54.d: "The government of [TTR.GetName] has clearly been behind this — it has now come to light that labour unrest has erupted in Ufa, primarily among the Russian and Tatar populations. The protesters are calling for immediate annexation of the region to [TTR.GetNameDef], and for the unity of the working class in their struggle against the capitalist oppressors and the \"bourgeois administration of Bashkurdistan\".\n\nIf we attempt to quell this uprising by force, it could potentially escalate into a full-blown conflict with the Tatar population. Conversely, if we capitulate to the demands of the rebels and surrender Ufa, we risk losing the support and respect of our own people."
tatsoc.54.a: "We'd better give up Ufa."
tatsoc.54.b: "Crush those Tatar imperialists. Ufa is a Bashkir city."

tatsoc.55.t: "Bashkirs Give Up!"
tatsoc.55.d: "Surprisingly, the Bashkir government has given in to the rebels' demands and allowed our forces to occupy the city."
tatsoc.55.a: "Soon, all of 'Bashkurdistan' will be liberated!"

tatsoc.56.t: "Crackdown on Tatars in Ufa!"
tatsoc.56.d: "The Bashkirs responded with force - yesterday, they have initiated a brutal crackdown on Tatar population in Ufa - particularly targeting the workers and peasants. We must assist the Ufa proletariat in their unequal fight against Bashkir war machine."
tatsoc.56.a: "We have no choice - we must liberate them!"
tatsoc.56.b: "Back down..."

tatsoc.60.t: "The Other Bulgarists"
tatsoc.60.d: "Against all odds, it would seem that two brilliant nationstates on earth now follow the truth of Bulgarism, casting off the shackles of false history slapped upon our wrists by Western academia. In Bulgaria proper with the bulk of the Bulgarist movement is Nikolay Sevastjanovich Derzhavin - head of his own group of Left-leaning professors, linguists, and anthropologists dedicated to the study of Slavic history despite ruling over a decidedly non-Socialist regime - while in lands of Tataria, one Ǧaynan Wäisev (aided by fellow Tatar nationalists like Säyet Vahidi) pushes the same ethnolinguistic claims that all Slavs originated along the Volga among the ancient Bulgars while also extolling the virtues of Islamic Socialism and his Wäisi movement, itself an anti-bourgeois movement inspired by the Jadidists but taken to a more radical and openly-Leftist direction. Despite the differences in our two regimes, with Wäisev being far more ideologically committed to leftism than Derzhavin who largely just focuses on the traditionalist, almost-pagan side of Bulgarism, it is obvious that few other, if any, regimes around would support our fringe truths. With this in mind, should we work with our fellow Bulgarists despite the ideological differences, or should we carry the torch of true Bulgarism alone?"
tatsoc.60.a: "We shall cooperate with these fellow Bulgarist dreamers." #(alliance between eachother)
tatsoc.60.b: "United as one, we shall achieve the Bulgarist dream together." #(player-controlled one annexes the other, gets control of the volga puppet)
tatsoc.60.c: "There can only be one true Bulgar state; ready the men for battle!" #(war/cores on the other)
tatsoc.60.e: "Ignore these foolish false heralds of Bulgarism." #(ignore them)

ttr_idu.1.t: "Liberation of [1197.GetName]"
ttr_idu.1.d: "In January 1918, a conference of residents of the region was convened in [1197.GetName], where a majority of those in attendance voted in favour of joining Bashkirdistan. Consequently, the conference announced the establishment of a «Department of Bashkir Language and Culture».\n\nAt the same time, our Millät Mäjlese, the coordinating body of Idel-Ural, dispatched a message to the participants of the conference, urging them to support the integration with the Idel-Ural State. This proposal gained support at the conference, effectively meaning that [1197.GetName] became part of Idel-Ural. However, since Idel-Ural never exerted control over any territory beyond some districts of Kazan, this union was merely a formality.\n\nSubsequently, the [1197.GetName] Congress was dissolved by the Kazan Workers’, Peasants’ and Soldiers’ Soviet.\n\nWhile the Bashkir nationalists engaged in a struggle for Belebey and Sterlitamak, our Legionnaires successfully infiltrated [1197.GetName], seizing control of the city and liberating it from the grip of the Russian revolutionaries. However, this act would undoubtedly provoke a diplomatic incident with Bashkir leadership."
ttr_idu.1.a: "[1197.GetName] is a Tatar city!"

ttr_idu.2.t: "The Legion Suggests Offensive on [1198.GetName]"
ttr_idu.2.d: "The leadership of the Tatar Legion is contemplating an operation to cross the Volga and seize control of [1198.GetName], a Tatar settlement located on the opposite bank. This territory is inhabited by Tatars and is currently under enemy control. Should we sanction this operation, it would allow them to expand their influence and consolidate their presence. However, our objective remains to liberate all Tatar territories from foreign occupation."
ttr_idu.2.a: "Liberate the right bank!"
ttr_idu.2.b: "This is too risky!"

ttr_idu.3.t: "The Consul of Chuvashia"
ttr_idu.3.d: "Despite the fact that the Tatar nation, thanks to the efforts of the Tatar Legion, managed to liberate a portion of our ancestral land from the revolutionary forces of Russia, not all ethnic groups were so fortunate. The situation for our Chuvash brethren is far from ideal.\n\nAlmost from the moment of the uprising in Petrograd, the Left SRs, led by the Chuvash Left Socialist Committee, and their prominent figures such as Daniil Elmen and Timakhvi Khuri, assumed control in Cheboksary, the largest city of the Chuvash people. These traitors to the national cause swiftly acknowledged the authority in Petrograd, leaving the Chuvash people seemingly doomed.\n\nDespite this, there are still patriots and true heroes among the Chuvash. One such individual is Fyodor Paymuk, a 35 year old merchant, who served in the Russian Army and graduated from the Industrial and Economic Institute. In recent years he published a newspaper 'For National Freedom', and he actively sought to achieve greater autonomy for the Chuvash people, but his efforts were in vain.\n\nHowever, with the emergence of the Tatar Legion, these hopes may not be so far-fetched. Fyodor immediately joined the Legion as a volunteer, and the Legionary leadership recognized him as a true champion of Idel-Ural's freedom. Ähmät Yarullin has officially appointed Fyodor as the Consul of Chuvashia within the Legion, acknowledging him as the official voice of the Chuvash community."
ttr_idu.3.a: "All peoples of Idel-Ural will be liberated."

ttr_idu.4.t: "Society for the Study of the Local Region"
ttr_idu.4.d: "In the year 1921, the Chuvash National Museum in Cheboksary founded the Society for the Study of Local Region, a scholarly organization dedicated to the exploration of the local area, dissemination of scientific knowledge about it, and promotion of cultural awareness among the Chuvash people about the life and traditions of various ethnic groups in the region. The members of this society engaged in meticulous record-keeping and documentation of archaeological sites. They actively participated in archaeological excavations, meticulously cataloging artifacts for future museum collections. On occasion, they conducted exploratory digs, meticulously examining tombstones inscribed with Arabic script. They delved into the analysis of ancient objects, including the excavation of the Tikhomirovsky Hoard, a cache of Jochid coins, in the year 1928.\n\nThe society has been divided into various sections, including natural history, historical and archaeological, ethnographic, socio-political, artistic and literary, scientific and educational, organisational and instructional, informational and since 1925, constitutional. This is where the real fun begins.\n\nAlthough the Chuvash nation gained separate autonomy within Russia, their powers were far from ideal for the Chuvash national leaders. The leaders of the society, particularly Metri Yuman, adopted the Bulgarist theory of the origins of the Chuvash as their main doctrine. In a series of works published in the 1920s, they advocated the claim that the Chuvash were the sole direct and pure descendants of the Volga-Kama Bulgarians and idealised the era of Volga Bulgaria's statehood. Members of the Society even discussed the idea of renaming the Chuvash Autonomous Region to the Bulgarian Autonomous Region and changing the name of the people from Chuvash to Bulgars. As a result, a strong movement among the Chuvash for Bulgarian identity emerged.\n\nIn the wake of the outbreak of civil war in Russia, the Society have fled from revolutionary Cheboksary to seek refuge in Kazan, where they now seek support from our administration. We are willing to assist them, yet this runs counter to our vision of establishing a Turko-Tatar nation, in which there is no room for the chauvinistic aspirations of the Bulgarist nationalists."

### Events for Kazan Khan ###
kazan.10.t: "Shafi Seizes the Kazan Kremlin"
kazan.10.d: "The Kazan Kremlin is an ancient fortress, the main citadel of Kazan and a symbol of the Tatar state. If Shafi Almas takes over the Kremlin, he will gain power and recognition. It is likely that we should consider his actions as an attempt at a military coup.\n\nBy the arrival of the joint troops of the Tatar legionnaires of Yarullin and the Bashkir troops of Tagan, the guards guarding the Kremlin were already wounded or killed, and the entrance to the Kremlin was barricaded. Almas ' legionnaires had taken over the building and were now defending its walls. Before the eyes of the Tatar and Bashkir leader, a yellow flag with the image of Zilant, the legendary Tatar dragon, the symbol of the Kazan Khanate, slowly rose above the Kremlin.\n\nImmediately starting the siege of the medieval fortress, the combined Tatar-Bashkir army faced a fierce defense of the Almas legionnaires. A couple dozen were killed, and dozens more were injured. However, the outcome of the battle was not yet decided..."
kazan.10.a: "The I-UMB Forces Were Destroyed"
kazan.10.b: "The Almas Legionnaires Give Up the Kremlin"

kazan.11.t: "In the Halls of Kremlin"
kazan.11.d: "The last of socialist opposition were soon surrounded in a retaliatory strike and arrested. They were taken to the Kremlin, where they met Almas, dressed in the costume of the Kazan Khan. On his head was a replica of the cap of the Kazan khan. The poor soldiers couldn't utter a single word, stunned by the sight.\n\nFinally, Almas spoke: 'I, being proclaimed by the Tatar people and called to rule, am the new Khan of Kazan, Shafi. And in accordance with the emergency decrees, I will defend my country and homeland from all those who attempt to destroy it. On behalf of the Tatar people, I sentence you to death by quartering.'\n\nHaving said this, Almas retired in his robes, asking the advisers of the "new khan" to send out to all the newspapers of the world that Khan Shafi of the Almas family had taken the Kazan Kremlin and announced the restoration of the Kazan Khanate, which had perished in time and centuries.'"
kazan.11.a: "The Khanate Returns!"

kazan.12.t: "In the Halls of Kremlin"
kazan.12.d: "Breaking into the fortress, and destroying the last defense of Almas, Yarullin and Tagan entered the chambers. In the middle of the hall stood Shafi Almas in the costume of the Kazan khan and with a replica of the Khan's hat on his head. He looked stupid and confused. Immediately, he was arrested and taken to the nearest police station, where he would be expected first to spend a night with drunks, and then to be tried for a failed military coup attempt and treason.\n\nHaving extinguished the last hotbeds of the Almas uprising, Yarullin and Tagan returned to the congress to complete it and make an important decision for the state. Yarullin was elected the new president of the Idel-Ural State by a majority vote of the delegates."
kazan.12.a: "Poor Shafi Almas, maybe he needs treatment..."

kazan.13.t: "Empowering Tatar Nobility"
kazan.13.d: "In Kazan society, the most privileged classes were the nobility and the clergy. The title of Karachi belonged to the heads of the four most noble Tatar families — Shirin, Bargin, Argyn and Kipchak, and was inherited. Karachi by their position were the closest advisers and de facto co-rulers of the Kazan Khan. Since then, many years have passed and there are no descendants of these noble families. And so the power will pass to those whom we ourselves recognize as the new Kazan nobility. And either they will bend the knee, or they will perish.\n\nAccording to the decree of the Khan of Kazan Shafi, of the Almas family, called the First, representatives of the upper classes of the Tatar nobility must appear at the Khan's palace in the Kazan Kremlin, kneel and swear eternal loyalty to the Khan. If they refuse, they will be executed. If they agree, they will receive lands and a legal title, their children will have the right to inherit their lands and titles, they will be forever loyal to the Khan and serve for the benefit of the Tatar State."

From now on and forever, until the blood of the last Khan of Kazan is shed, which we will never allow, we will recognize him as our sovereign on behalf of all the subjects of Great Tartary. We recognize his authority as sacred and given by Allah for the sake of preserving the Tatar nation and sovereignty, for the sake of the prosperity of the Tatar society, the development of science, folk crafts and culture. From now on and forever, the power of the Khan is irrefutable and is recognized by all members of society as inalienable, irreversible and inescapable.

All dissenters will be enslaved or executed-at the discretion of their master, because now they are simply nothing but subjects of the Khan.\n\nTheir duties will include collecting tribute and paying tribute to the Khan, but in exchange they will be able to cultivate these lands, build factories and factories, anything to develop the great Khanate."

kazan.16.d: "Only one religion unites the Tatars and only it has the right to exist within the borders of the Khanate. And this is the religion - Islam. Every educated Tatar who is not enslaved is obliged to practice this religion, observe its rules and laws, and anyone who slanders the Prophet or the Khan does not observe our customs and traditions - they offend our nation.\n\nFrom now on, by the decree of the Great Khan, all the subjects of the Khanate are obliged to accept Islam and obey its vows. In case of refusal, as always, they will be quartered and destroyed, their ashes will be thrown into the Volga or Kama and carried away by its waves from the lands of the Khanate, because there is no place for the scum of society"
kazan.16.a: "One Religion. One Khan."

kazan.17.t: "The Zilant Awakens!"
kazan.17.d: "A Zilant is a legendary creature with the head of a dragon, the body of a bird, the legs of a chicken, the tail of a snake, the ears of a canine, red wings, sharp teeth, dark-gray feathers and scaly dark-gray skin.\n\nAccording to one story, a beautiful damsel married a resident of Old Kazan. She had to get water from the Qazansu River and complained to the local khan his capital was poorly situated. She advised him to move the city to Zilantaw Hill, and the khan agreed. However, the hill was infested with numerous snakes which were "stout as a log". Their leader was a giant two-headed snake, the Zilant. One head ate only grass, while the other swallowed virgins. A wizard advised the Khan to build a straw and wood near the hill. In spring, the snakes came out from their winter burrows and crept into the pile of straw. A knight errant was sent out to set the pile of straw on fire, burning out the snakes. They were deadly even in death, killing people and horses with their stink. However, the gigantic two-headed snake-dragon escaped to the Qaban lakes. According to the story he still lives in the waters of the lake and, from time to time, takes vengeance on the citizens.\n\nThe Zilant has for long been the symbol of Tataria, symbol of Khan and there's no doubt that it exists... the Khan believes in it anyway, and believes that his strength and power is dependent on Zilant. And now the Zilant has Awakened. By the fire and force of the Zilant, the Kazan Khanate will rebuilt itself and destroy traitorous Russians that still claim that this is their land. It is no more and they shall be taught a lesson."
kazan.17.a: "The Zilant Shall Destroy the Muscovites!"

kazan.20.t: "The Kazan Khan Captures Moscow!"
kazan.20.d: "The troops of the great Khan finally laid siege to Moscow and stormed the ancient fortress - a symbol of Russian statehood. Soon, Khan Shafi himself arrived in the capital, who solemnly raised a yellow flag with a zilant over the Kremlin. On the same day, a messenger was immediately dispatched with a telegram to the leader of Muscovy - demanding that he kneel before Khan Shafi of the house of Almas, called the First.\n\nAt long last, we have avenged the year 1552, when the troops of the damned Ivan the Terrible took Kazan and began the enslavement of our great nation, the descendants of Genghis Khan. As a token of gratitude for the Russian government's surrender, we will grant them autonomy, but we will impose a tribute upon them. Besides, there will be no more Russia. It is time to restore them to their real name and put on the throne a descendant of Genghisid - Prince Yusupov, who will have to swear eternal loyalty to the Khan."
kazan.20.a: "1552 Avenged!"

kazan.23.t: "Alliance with [FROM.GetNameDefCap]?"
kazan.23.d: "The revived [FROM.GetNameDefCap] wants to form a strong alliance between our Turkic brethren to make us strong in the world of European Dominance."
kazan.23.a: "Let's do it"
kazan.23.b: "They are too... strange"

kazan.24.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused Alliance!"
kazan.24.d: "The traitorous [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to have an alliance with us. We will cut all relations with this traitors of the Turkic race!"
kazan.24.a: "They will regret this..."

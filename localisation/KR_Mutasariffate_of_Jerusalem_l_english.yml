### Events
pal.1.t:0 "The Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem in 1936"
pal.1.d:0 "Created as an international zone during the closing stage of the Weltkrieg, the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem has grown almost completely out of control. Its borders defined by an arbitrary demarcation based on the defensive fortifications of the 'Allenby Line', the zone not only splits in half Palestine but also destroyed initial attempts by the Zionist community to settle around Haifa. By ways of compromising with all parties involved, a convoluted administrative structure was created which has left neither party happy. Built on top of the old Kudus-I-Serif Mutasarrifate, this region was expanded southwards towards the Red Sea to ensure a harbour outside of the Mediterranean.\n\nThe administrative structure of the M.O.J. (Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem) is comprised of two main governing bodies: The International Council, consisting of representative from Germany, the USA, Austria-Hungary, Britain and the Ottoman Empire is the de facto power in the region, regulating immigration, taxation and overseeing the attached International Gendarmerie force. A second body, consists of representatives of all the religious movements in the region and acts as the local government in close cooperation with the International Council which oversees their budget. At the head of this entire structure sits the Ottoman Mutasarrif, appointed by the Sultan himself but left virtually powerless to govern what is de jure still a province of the Sublime Porte.\n\nThe Palestinian Arabs however are deeply discontent with the arranged structure and the continued growth of the Jewish population, further boosted by increasing immigration to the 'Holy Land' has left them at odds with the International Gendarmerie and the tax collecting agencies. Serving as the basis for more radical change in the Middle East, the region also serves as a hotbed of awakening Arab nationalism, further fanned by the regime in Cairo. The Caliph finds himself tied as within the Ottoman Empire, calls increase for the abolition of the zone but unable to act unless he wants to suffer the ire of the powers that be. Nonetheless, operatives from the Porte and propaganda broadcasts transmitted from neighbouring Haifa are prepping the Palestinian population for the return of Ottoman authority and assisting the resistance in speeding the collapse of the M.O.J."
pal.1.a:0 "Things are not looking well"

pal.2.t:0 "Economic Depression Hits the M.O.J."
pal.2.d:0 "The collapse of the Berlin stock exchange has sent shockwaves throughout the world to great detriment of our own region. As the Ottoman Empire desperately attempts to soften the initial blow, Palestine has been hit even harder. Our almost complete reliance on the international market has left us especially vulnerable as quasi all sectors but the agricultural one have imploded."
pal.2.a:0 "This is a disaster!"

pal.3.t:0 "Protest in Jaffa"
pal.3.d:0 "As the economic depression becomes worse by the day and the International Council continues to avoid measures to soften the blow, citizens of both Jaffa and Tel Aviv have taken to the streets today to demand intervention by their 'government' and to restore ties to the Sublime Porte. Even though the nature of these protests was peaceful in nature, gendarmerie arrested a few of the Muslims attending to 'avoid further escalation'."
pal.3.a:0 "Order must be kept at all times!"

pal.4.t:0 "Shortages Continue Increasing"
pal.4.d:0 "With the international trade still in disarray, shortages of coal, oil, food and industrial products keep rising in the M.O.J.. Local manufacturing has almost completely stopped as both import and export has grinded to a complete standstill. Dockworkers in Jaffa have been laid off dramatically the last few weeks as the most important harbour of the M.O.J. continues to suffer from the lack of shipping. Relief packages by the Ottoman Empire have been halted at the border of the DMZ and rejected by Gendarmerie forces to avoid increasing the reliance on Damascus and stop possible weapon smuggling for the Palestinian resistance."
pal.4.a:0 "We just have to weather the storm"

pal.5.t:0 "American Forces Depart the M.O.J."
pal.5.d:0 "As America descends once more into Civil War, [USA.GetLeader] has given the order to recall all active American personnel from Palestine to reinforce the homefront. Having served as one of the most important partners in the International Gendarmerie since its inception in 1920, the withdrawal of the United States has made its forces even more thinly stretched than before."
pal.5.a:0 "Johnny is marching home again"

pal.6.t:0 "Smuggling in the Sinai"
pal.6.d:0 "The economic crisis has invigorated the Palestinian resistance once more giving rise to an increased demand for arms and support from our government. Old smuggling routes through the Sinai have been reactivated as the International Gendarmerie force struggles to patrol its vast territory. Not only arms are being brought in though as the growing shortage of basic goods has forced many Palestinians to resort to the Black Market which is seeing a steady stream of supplies from inside our territory."
pal.6.a:0 "The whole rotten corpse will be brought down from within!"

pal.7.t:0 "Radio Free Palestine Increases Operations"
pal.7.d:0 "Founded as a radio broadcast to rally public opinion against the M.O.J. and Jewish settlement in general, it has recently increased its operations dramatically as under the table dealings with the Ittihad party have enabled it to set up further posts closer to the border. Although the government denies all responsibility over the organisation to foreign diplomats of the Porte and the Jerusalem Accords representatives, it is no secret that they tie into our governments designs on the Middle East and are used to focus and encourage Arab discontent in the Ottoman Empire."
pal.7.a:0 "'Is it not the Caliph who has sacrificed you so he could keep his crown?'"

pal.8.t:0 "Fourth Aliyah Commences"
pal.8.d:0 "Political developements across the globe have caused great disarray to its settled Jewish population. Now the USA, beacon of freedom and liberty has been hit by another devastating civil war causing thousands of refugees to spill over to all corners of the world. The Jewish population as well, seeing itself targeted by the Union State is suffering with many now pursuing the Zionist dream. Flocking into the harbour of Tel Aviv, thousands of educated Jews are bringing with them their capital and experience to help create the new Jewish home. Arab discontent at this new influx of Jewish settlers is already mounting further fuelled by the unrest caused by the economic fallout and gendarmerie forces are struggling to keep the order in all corners of the M.O.J."
pal.8.a:0 "Welcome to the M.O.J."

pal.9.t:0 "Increased Eastern European Migration"
pal.9.d:0 "Anti-semitic regimes have token hold over Eastern European nations leading to an increasing amount of progroms and discrimiation against their Jewish population. With no place to go and their backs turned against the walls of Russia, many are embarking on the long journey South towards Palestine to hopefully find a safehaven. Unwilling to further increase tensions in the M.O.J. multiple members of the local government have asked the Council to close immigration as further encouraging it only plays into the hands of the Arab nationalists."
pal.9.a:0 "Welcome to the M.O.J."

pal.10.t:0 "Increasing Sectarian Divide"
pal.10.d:0 "The rapid increase in Jewish settlers arriving on the shores of Tel Aviv is only further bolstering the Arab aversion to the M.O.J. leading to increasing crimes against settlers and protest actions throughout the region. Mediation from the Mutasarrif has failed to accomplish much as the Mufti of Jerusalem continues to preach for a closure to Jewish immigration."
pal.10.a:0 "There is no reason to blow up this little bit of friction"

pal.11.t:0 "Protests Escalate in Jerusalem"
pal.11.d:0 "Called on by local Arab notables and leaders, a mass protest was held in the city of Jerusalem earlier today to pressure the Council into the closure of the immigration office. What started as a peaceful protest quickly escalated after gendarmerie forces started cracking down on some of its leaders. In response the protestors started throwing stones at windows of foreign businesses and assault foreign nationals on the streets of the city. Eventually the authorities were able to subdue the protest before further violence could spread but with resources spread thin, the action has scared the International Council that the situation might be far more explosive than initially thought."
pal.11.a:0 "A curfew is enacted in Jerusalem"

pal.12.t:0 "Council Closes off Further Jewish Immigration"
pal.12.d:0 "In response for increasing calls by the Muslim population and the Jerusalem riot only a few weeks earlier, the Council has officially decreed an end to Jewish immigration and has decreed that no further settlers will be allowed entry into the zone until an accord has been reached with the local leaders. Whilst it is unlikely to fully stop immigrants from coming in due to the limited resources of the Council to enforce the decree, this marks an important turning point in the policy of the M.O.J."
pal.12.a:0 "Let's hope this calms the Arabs down"

pal.13.t:0 "Riots in Jaffa"
pal.13.d:0 "Not silenced by the reversal of the immigration policy, riots and protests continued to shake Palestine further encouraged by both Egyptian and Arab movements alike. The breaking point was finally reached in Jaffa earlier today as yet another action against the authorities turned bloody after overwhelmed Gendarmerie opened fire on the Arab protestors leading to the deaths of 23 Arabs. Various governments in the Middle East have already reacted to the events demanding the immediate departure of International forces and the abolishement of the M.O.J. before further violence breaks out. Furthermore this first display of open conflict between the two groups will likely lead to repression against the Jewish settlers and continued actions against the authorities."
pal.13.a:0 "This isn't going so well anymore..."

pal.14.t:0 "Violence in the M.O.J."
pal.14.d:0 "Increasing Jewish migration and a decrease in resources after the American forces pulled out last year has caused violence to erupt once more in the M.O.J. leading to the deaths of multiple dozen Arabs in peacekeeping and strikebreaking actions. Our government has in responce increased its calls for the abolishement of the entity, pointing out that only Ottoman rule can end the crisis peacefully. Various Jewish groups across our empire are also calling on the Sultan to take a more decisive stance towards the M.O.J. as they fear retaliation by their Arab brethren for the actions by the International Gendarmerie."
pal.14.a:0 "Send new orders to our Mutasarrif"

pal.15.t:0 "General Strike in Palestine"
pal.15.d:0 "Organised by various Arab National Committees a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping has been called to force the departure of international forces. Listing their demands as 1) Prohibition of all Jewish immigration now and in the future 2) Prohibition of the transfer of territory from Arabs to Jews 3) Immediate withdrawal of the International Gendarmerie, a vast portion of the Arab population is primed to partake in the action encouraged by religious leaders and influential families. The Council has already reported that it will crack down heavily on any attempts to force its departure and gendarmerie forces have already been sent into Jaffa to arrest possible ringleaders of the strike."
pal.15.a:0 "We will not give up our position!"

pal.16.t:0 "General Strike Endures"
pal.16.d:0 "Attempts to crush the strike with force have failed as the entire region has been paralysed by the continued action. Everything from the railways to the administration to the industry has completely laid down the work. Furthermore open conflict has started to roar up again as sniper actions in various cities around the region targetting foreign nationals and guerilla actions against the Jewish settlers and the Gendarmerie are shaking the countryside. Thinly spread gendarmerie forces are attempting to keep order and the destruction of hundreds of homes in Jaffa in an attempt to flush out the rebels backfired greatly leading to even more pressure in both the city and Jerusalem itself.\n\nAs various partners of the Jerusalem Accords are entangled in domestic affairs with world war looming ever more, the International Council has commissioned a report on the continued viability of the M.O.J. and has opened talks with the Ottoman government to pursue possible solutions."
pal.16.a:0 "All is falling down"

pal.17.t:0 "Egypt Demands a seat on the Council"
pal.17.d:0 "Throwing themselves up as the defenders of all Arabs, the Egyptian government is using the crisis in Palestine to increase its power projection in the region. Answering calls from various Arab organisations in Palestine, Egypt argues that it should have a say in the future of the M.O.J. and its administration. The Ottoman delegation has already vetoed the proposal but the action shows that conflict is brewing ever stronger between the two regional powers and that the M.O.J. might find itself in the middle of their battlefield on short notice."
pal.17.a:0 "Organise a congress to settle the affair once and for all"

pal.18.t:0 "Congress of Haifa Opens Its Doors"
pal.18.d:0 "As violence continues to escalate across the region, the various signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have agreed to partake in a congress to decide the future of the M.O.J.. The Ottoman delegation has already put all its cards on the table and has demanded the immediate reunification with Konstantiniyye pointing out that the current chaos is fully to blame on those that took it away from the Porte in 1920. Meanwhile the Egyptian government is openly calling for its attachment to Egypt, claiming that the Arabs should be united and that the Ottoman actions during the Weltkrieg are what led to its creation in the first place. The Committee sent out to investigate the sustainability with the limited Gendarmerie forces available has also returned with a negative answer, proscribing its reunification to the Ottoman Empire but with an overseeing panel ensuring the Jews are kept safe from reprisals and granted land to settle on."
pal.18.a:0 "The representatives will decide"

pal.19.t:0 "Congress of Haifa: Future of the M.O.J."
pal.19.d:0 "As one of the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords in 1920, we have kept a representative on the International Council of the M.O.J. ever since. Recent events in Palestine however have called these powers back together to decide over the future of the international zone as the entire region wages a war against the International Gendarmerie tasked with its security. Thinly stretched forces, limited resources and aggressive moves from both the Sublime Porte and the Egyptians are threatening its future and as the committee tasked with researching its sustainability has given a negative report, many in our own administration are questioning its continued existence."
pal.19.a:0 "Abolish the M.O.J."
pal.19.b:0 "We will not withdraw!"

pal.20.t:0 "International Council Votes for the Abolition of the M.O.J."
pal.20.d:0 "In response to issues in Palestine, the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have voted in favour of its abolition and the reintegration into the Ottoman Empire. Proposals to return the Sinai to Egypt were vetoed by our representatives to great annoyance of both Cairo and the other powers which ultimately conceded to putting it under joint control by both nations, something those two have already denounced. Whether or not this solves the Palestine issue remains to be seen but what is for certain is that conflict between the Ottomans and Egypt is only starting.\n\nWith the last paperwork still left to be done and an orderly transfer of authority from the Gendarmerie to the Ottoman army being organised, the MOJ will continue to function for a weeks longer although it will no longer have the power to decide on internal matters, now a strictly Ottoman affair."
pal.20.a:0 "A wise decision"

pal.21.t:0 "Sinai Question"
pal.21.d:0 "As the abolition of the M.O.J. approaches after the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords agreed on its reintegration into the Ottoman Empire, issues still remain over the disputed Sinai peninsula. The Ottomans claim it as part of the M.O.J. and before that as part of their Egyptian territory although their main drive seems centred around extending control over the Suez Canal. A resolution offered by the Council to return the Sinai is still under consideration but strongly attacked by the Ottoman representatives. With the Ottoman army mobilising to garrison the region, time is running out to retake control and launch our offensive into the Ottoman Empire as once entrenched it is unlikely we will succeed in dislodging their army which will be positioned within striking distance of our capital."
pal.21.a:0 "Occupy the peninsula"
pal.21.b:0 "We will await their decision"

pal.22.t:0 "Congress of Haifa : Future of the Sinai"
pal.22.d:0 "The Egyptian government has requested the return of the Sinai Peninsula, threatening to go to war over it if their demands aren't met. The Ottoman representatives at the congress continue to oppose all regulations to include the Egyptian into the debate and have now been sidelined in an attempt to prevent Palestine from becoming a battlefield between these two nations."
pal.22.a:0 "Egypt will receive the Sinai"
pal.22.b:0 "The Porte will receive the Sinai"

pal.23.t:0 "Council Votes Against the Return of the Sinai"
pal.23.d:0 "In a not so shocking turn of events, the proposal to return the disputed peninsula to our control was shot down at the Congress of Haifa and assigned to the Ottoman Empire. Whilst evidently a large blow to our prestige, the Egyptian army stands ready at the Suez to retake the Sinai by force before Ottoman troops can reinforce the region waiting only for the Sultans command."
pal.23.a:0 "Invade the M.O.J."
pal.23.b:0 "We seek no conflict with the Porte"

pal.24.t:0 "Egypt Crosses the Suez"
pal.24.d:0 "In blatant breach of the conclusions reached at Haifa, the Egyptian army has crossed the Suez with the intentions of fully occupying the M.O.J.. The closest army units in Damascus and Beirut, already on stand-by for the duration of the congress should the conclusion been less desirable, are ready to counter the Egyptians and are now solely awaiting the command of their Padishah."
pal.24.a:0 "To war!"
pal.24.b:0 "Concede Palestine to Egypt"

pal.25.t:0 "International Council Votes against the Abolition of the M.O.J."
pal.25.d:0 "In yet another sign of European treachery, the International Council has decreed its opposition to the abolition of the M.O.J.. Army units mobilised in Damascus and Beirut however in preparation for another betrayal have been granted marching orders to re-militarise the M.O.J. by force to great anger of both the International Community and the Egyptian government."
pal.25.a:0 "We will not stand for yet another insult!"

pal.26.t:0 "Ottoman Army Moves into the M.O.J."
pal.26.d:0 "Betrayed by the International Council, the Porte has decided to take affairs into their own hands and have ordered the re-militarisation of the entire M.O.J. including the disputed Sinai peninsula. With the Ottoman army mobilising to garrison the region, time is running out to retake control and launch our offensive into the Ottoman Empire as once entrenched it is unlikely we will succeed in dislodging their army which will be positioned within striking distance of our capital."
pal.26.a:0 "Move into the Sinai to force its return"
pal.26.b:0 "Invade the Ottoman Empire"

pal.27.t:0 "Egypt Invades the Sinai"
pal.27.d:0 "In response to our actions in Palestine, the Egyptian army has invaded the Sinai peninsula hoping to pressure us into returning it to them. With Egyptian aims clearly greater than just the little strip of desert, it may be wiser however to make an example out of them and put them down before other nations start sensing weakness."
pal.27.a:0 "To war!"
pal.27.b:0 "Concede Sinai to Egypt"

pal.28.t:0 "Congress of Haifa: Sinai"
pal.28.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events the International Council has assigned the Sinai to us and has requested Ottoman troops withdraw from the disputed peninsula. Since it is unlikely this will stop the Ottoman army, it may be wise to continue the offensive whilst we still have the element of surprise instead of getting bogged down in the trenches of Palestine."
pal.28.a:0 "Reinforce the Sinai"
pal.28.b:0 "To war!"

pal.29.t:0 "Pole Committee Publishes Report"
pal.29.d:0 "Headed by Sir Felix Pole, former chairman of Britain's Great Western Railway, the Pole Committee was tasked last year with investigating possible infrastructural expansion in the M.O.J. and solve the ever increasing financial troubles of the Palestinian Railways. Also tasked with improving the local stations and routes between Jerusalem, Jaffa and Tel Aviv the committee has now reported that substantial financial investment will be necessary to solve both congestion issues and the connection to the Ottoman Haifa.\n\nIt suggests the construction of a direct line from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem through Rishon LeZion to a junction with the Jerusalem line at the Niana. Furthermore the report also criticises the lack of investment in the port of Jaffa which due to its hazardous rocks form a perilous trip for any ocean-going vessel. Therefore he has requested a complete rebuilding of the harbour and an extension of the railroad from Jaffa station into the new harbour zone."

pal.31.d:0 "[EGY.GetLeader] was awoken to the sound of gunfire earlier today as a group of conspirators stormed the palace in an attempt to remove him from power. Calling themselves the Society of Justice, the group was planning to kill [EGY.GetLeader] and restore Abbas II to the throne. The last Ottoman Khedive, Abbas II has recently seen an increase in popularity across the muslim world as his Islamist ideas and history as leader of Egypt have given rise to various groups wishing for his return. Whilst adored by the people, [EGY.GetLeader] is less loved by his officer corps and government who see in his desires for absolute control and his general lack of knowledge concerning statecraft a recipe for disaster.\n\nNonetheless the failed coup attempt has come to the advantage of the Cairo regime as the close relation between the Khedive and the Ottoman government has shifted public opinion squarely against the Turks. [EGY.GetLeader] himself has already called the attack on his life a vicious plan by the imperialist Turks to smother Arab independence and has been heard taking an aggressive approach to the situation, calling for immediate sanctions on the Turks with some even saying that there was a mention of war with the Porte."

palarb.1.t:0 "Anti-Zionist Protest in Baghdad"
palarb.1.d:0 "Organised by students from the Baghdad Law College and Iraqi groups such as the Young Muslim Society, protests are rocking the capital of the Iraqi region. They are expressing their outrage towards the increasing Zionist settlements in the M.O.J. and calling on all Muslims in the empire to protect their Palestinian brethren from this threat."
palarb.1.a:0 "Disturbing"

palarb.2.t:0 "Anti-Zionist Actions in Iraq"
palarb.2.d:0 "After protests were ultimately quelled by the Wali of Baghdad for their disruptive nature, various Arab and Muslim groups expressed their grief in different ways. Days of mourning have been declared, prayers recited for the souls of all who perished in Palestine, and newspapers appear bordered in black.\n\nEven more disturbing is a romantic attachment to the flag of the failed Arab revolt which has regularly started to show up all across gatherings. Although its usage is officially banned by the state, many Arab gendarmerie units are refusing to intervene causing its distribution to increase at a rapid pace."
palarb.2.a:0 "This is starting to get out of hand"

palarb.3.t:0 "Murder in Baghdad"
palarb.3.d:0 "As tensions continue to mount in the M.O.J. and aggressive action is undertaken by the International Gendarmerie, relations between Muslims and Jews within the Ottoman Empire itself are also deteriorating.\n\nLast week two Jews were shot in the streets of Baghdad by “unknown persons” either for personal or political motives. A few days later another Jew was killed prompting demand from the Jewish community in the city for gendarmerie protection with which the Wali complied. Although further attacks have thus far not occurred, this only further confirms fears of increasing instability in the Mashriq."
palarb.3.a:0 "Most disturbing"

palarb.4.t:0 "Chief Rabbi Denounces the Zionist Program"
palarb.4.d:0 "Continued attacks on the Jewish community in Baghdad and threats in local newspapers demanding that the Rabbi expresses his opposition to the Zionist project and international Jewry in general, have forced the Chief Rabbi of the city to ultimately comply.\n\nTo further relieve tensions amongst the Muslim population, meetings to “explain” the Palestine situation were organized in Baghdad mosques after prayers commemorating the Ascent of the Prophet. Whether it was the message or the high attendance of plainclothes policemen which stopped further escalation is unclear."
palarb.4.a:0 "A wise decision"

palarb.5.t:0 "Society for the Defence of Palestine forms"
palarb.5.d:0 "Fostered by General Taha al-Hashimi, brother of the Baghdadi Wali Yasin al-Hashimi, the Society for the Defence of Palestine was formed earlier this week. Primarily created to collect donations for the Arab mujahidin fighting in Palestine, they are however also an important conduit for Arab nationalism as direct action from the government against the M.O.J. remains absent.\n\nNonetheless taking action against the group may be dangerous as the family connection between its founder and the Baghdadi Wali and War Hero, Yasin could lead to unfortunate consequences if not handled carefully."
palarb.5.a:0 "Shut down the SDP"
palarb.5.b:0 "Refrain from intervening"

palarb.6.t:0 "Arab Desperados Leave for Palestine"
palarb.6.d:0 "Coming from within the Ottoman army stationed in Iraq and Syria, a small group of volunteers and desperados has deserted the force to join the Palestinian guerilla movements. Presumably led by Fawzi al-Qawuqji, an Ottoman officer of Syrian descent, the group is reported to be well armed and receiving covert support from the Walis of the Mashriq."

palarb.7.t:0 "Creation of the Yavuz Sultan Selim Association"
palarb.7.d:0 "Based around the illustrous Sultan Selim I who conquered the entire Mamluk Sultanate in the early 16th Century, Turkish and Arab intelectuals have come together to press the Sultan for a resolution to the Palestinian crisis.\n\nOrganising debates, political fora and teaching local Arabs of the ties binding Turks and Arabs together over the last few centuries, a large focus is placed on teaching about the history of Ottoman Palestine and the prosperity it has encountered under the wing of the Caliph.\n\nSome have however discredited the association, calling it a propaganda stunt of the Konstantiniyye government who is finding it harder and harder by the day to find support for its Ottomanist ideology. Foreign observers in the meanwhile call it a stunt by the Grand Vizier to increase support amongst his population for military intervention in the region."
palarb.7.a:0 "Gods we were strong then"

palarb.8.t:0 "Protests in Haifa"
palarb.8.d:0 "Constituting the Northern part of what could be called Ottoman Palestine, the province of Haifa has long served as an economic centerpoint for the region. With the demarcation of the M.O.J. borders in 1920 based on an arbitrary position of the frontlines at the time, much of the economic connections between the North and South were disrupted. The growing Jewish community in the region was largely displaced in the following months to great anger of both Jews and Arabs alike.\n\nAs tensions continue to rise in the M.O.J., so have Palestinian Arabs in Haifa taken to the streets in support of their Southern brethren. Calling upon the Caliph to protect Islam from this foreign invasion, to reunite Palestine and to make a stand against imperial encroachement, thousands are marching down the city's narrow streets."
palarb.8.a:0 "This is getting out of hand real fast"

palarb.9.t:0 "Chief Rabbi Haim Ishak Saki Denounces the M.O.J."
palarb.9.d:0 "Usually not a man easy to react to political developments within the Empire, the Chief Rabbi of Constantinople (or Hakham Bashi) has decided to openly proclaim his support for the Ottoman government in their attempts to reintegrate the Palestinian region. Referencing the long and mutually cooperative history of Jews within the Ottoman system, he has attacked the Zionists whose primarily European mindset have no idea of the damage they are inflicting on the relations between Muslim and Jew in the Orient.\n\nSupport from Rabbis in Yemen, Baghdad and Tripolitania has arrived at the Hahambasilik (Chief Rabbinate) in the capital as they too experience increasing anti-Jewish attacks caused by the agitated Muslim population of the Empire. Although their words are unlikely to have any effect on policy in the region, it's the last in a long line of desperate attempts to de-escalate tensions."
palarb.9.a:0 "We are grateful for your support"

### Kurdish agitation events (Iran-Ottomans)
palkur.1.t:0 "Sheikh Mahmud Barzinji in Talks with [PER.GetName]"
palkur.1.d:0 "Leader of two failed attempts in Sulaymanyiah to carve out a Kurdish kingdom, the infamous Sheikh Mahmud has been seen in contact once again with representatives of the Iranian government according to our spies. Prominent Qadiri, the Sheikh had the other Kurds to thank for most of his failures as their unwillingness to subordinate themselves to the Sheikh would be their downfall. Ottoman officials in Iraq were quick to exploit their differences and by utilising Kurdish forces opposed to him such as the powerful Jaf, he was forced to flee across the border to Iran.\n\nAttempts by the Iranian government to supply his troops and send them back into Sulaymanyiah to cause havoc on the Ottoman periphery became less and less succesful as even his closest supporters started to believe the window had closed. Furthermore the Turks have countered this subterfuge with Kurdish pawns of their own. Simqi the Kurd, famous warlord of Iranian Kurdistan and feared by many an Assyrian for his excessive cruelty near Lake Urmia during the closing stages of the Weltkrieg has found his benefactor in the Ottoman government. Sometimes even going so far as fighting under a Turkish flag, this warlord caused great havoc and even succesfully defeated the Iranian army. Nonetheless, reinforcements from Teheran would ultimately prove his demise as he was just like his colleague further South driven across the border.\n\nThis back and forth game between the two powers came to an end in 1927 when the administration of Mustafa Kemal and the Iranian Shah concluded the Saadabad Pact. Both sides would from now on stop fostering Kurdish dissent on the other side of the border as the danger of awakening Kurdish nationalism was regarded as detrimental to the interests of both sides. A few low-level troublemakers were exchanged in a symbolic gesture whilst both sides also confirmed the 1913 Ottoman-Iranian border."
palkur.1.a:0 "What game are the Iranians playing?"

palkur.2.t:0 "Chaos Amidst the Jaf"
palkur.2.d:0 "The Kurdish tribal confederation of the Jaf, one of the most prominent in Iraqi Kurdistan, has been shaken up earlier this week following the murder of their Chief. Fighting on the side of the Ottoman army during the first revolt of Sheikh Mahmud, many have been quick to point fingers across the Iranian border where the exiled Chief has seemingly been building up his strength for a return to power.\n\nThe assassination has caused the dissafected members of the confederation to break with the central policy and prop up their own succesor whose vision on cooperation with the Ottoman regime is far less secure."
palkur.2.a:0 "Disturbing"

palkur.3.t:0 "Rising Dissent in Iraqi Kurdistan"
palkur.3.d:0 "With a general feeling of nearing war in the air, stability has taken a nosedive in the region of Sulaymanyiah. Raids by two powerful tribes, the Hawrami and Hamavand (allies of Sheikh Mahmud during his revolt) have become so unbearable that merchants and other urban citizens have been forced to leave for Kirkuk and Mosul where protection from the local confederations and the Ottoman gendarmerie are granting them much needed respite. Protests against the slow response of the government have also seen an uptick in the region as many Kurds start losing faith in the military to prevent them from harm.\n\nNonetheless the army has sent a detachement of 3000 men and an air squadron into the territory of the troublesome tribes to put an end to their disturbance. The Iranian government was quick to respond that the scale of these troop movements so close to their border can only be a sign that the Turks are planning to invade Iranian Kurdistan and drive out the Kurds currently living there."
palkur.3.a:0 "Another waste of brave Turkish soldiers..."

palkur.4.t:0 "Sheikh Mahmud Arrives in Sulaymanyiah"
palkur.4.d:0 "Riding out at the head of 500 horsemen, the exiled and self-styled 'King of Kurdistan' has returned to his home. To no ones surprise this has given another boost to the morale of the rebelling Kurds who see in the timely return of their hero a sign that the tide is finally turning. Both the Hawrami and Hamavand were quick to pledge their allegiance to the Sheikh and have both sent detachements of their tribes to his base of operation near the Iranian border. Certain factions of the Jaf confederation, still recovering from the blatant attack on their leadership, have also taken his side whilst others remain on the fence as the Iranian support Mahmud promises seems unlikely to arrive.\n\nAs a blatant breach of the Saadabad Pact, the government in Konstantiniyye has demanded an immediate answer from Iran in the matter to explain why they didn't stop the Sheikh from returning. A telegram was also promptly sent to Eastern Anatolia with the orders to arm the remnants of Simqi's army and put them on stand-by for similar operations around Lake Urmia should the Iranians not back down."
palkur.4.a:0 "They better give us a good explanation!"

palkur.5.t:0 "Border Conflict in Kurdistan"
palkur.5.d:0 "The Ottoman-Iranian border has always been a fickle beast, not in the least due to the large number of Kurdish tribes that don't identify with either side and migrate back and forth depending on the season. Efforts were undertaken in the 19th century to more decisevely mark this border, a work that took almost a hundred years when it was affirmed in 1913. Nonetheless both the Turks and us have been sabotaging the other side wherever we can and have done so with great succes through Kurdish pawns.\n\nThe 1920's saw an end to this rivalry however as the damage the support for Kurdish agitators on the other side did caused massive rammifications to the loyalty of our own Kurds. The Saadabad Pact was thus created as an agreement between our two governments to cease operations to foster Kurdish national sentiment in 1927.\n\nThe rise of Arab nationalism and the trouble created by the Egyptian government have made our government however 'reconsider' this idea as with the Middle East seemingly set on a course that can only end in war, Iranian hawks have sent the exiled Sheikh Mahmud Barzanji into Sulaymanyiah in an effort to soften up the Eastern flank of the Porte. As a blatant breach of the Saadabad Pact, the Ottoman government has now demanded an explanation and has threathened to tear up the treaty if we do not withdraw at once."
palkur.5.a:0 "Just deny everything"

palkur.6.t:0 "Iran Denies Any Responsibility"
palkur.6.d:0 "In response to our allegations, the Iranian government has decided to deny all responsibility in the Sulaymanyiah affair. They claim that Mahmut escaped from his guards and was fully on his own able to cross the border. Any incidents he may have caused after that are none of Irans business which was followed by a snide remark that maybe the Ottomans should look at their own mismanagement instead of shifting blame to other nations.\n\nReports from our agents in Iran and Kurdistan however contradict this statement as reports of Iranian Kurds within the ranks of Barzinji have started to come in. Furthermore the question also remains how he could have possibly financed the host he raised without foreign backing.\n\nTherefore the council of ministers has officially elicited the services of Simqi who has been armed with Ottoman rifles, machine guns and even artillery pieces. Within his ranks, a few Ottoman foot soldiers have also been placed to ensure that he remains controllable by the government if necessary."
palkur.6.a:0 "It seems the Saadabad Pact is dead"

palkur.7.t:0 "Return of Simqi"
palkur.7.d:0 "An infamous Kurdish warlord, it seems that in response to the action of Mahmud Barzanji, the Turks have sent their own pawn back into our territory. Simqi, a Kurd from the Lake Urmia region is especially known amongst the Assyrians who he brutally massacred together with Ottoman forces when they fled into Iran during the Weltkrieg. He didn't stop there however as during the early 20's he tried to carve out his own Kurdish state with the tacit support of the Ottoman military. It would take multiple embarrassing defeats and a substantial army to finally push him out, leaving the region in tatters.\n\nHis return is therefore all the more disturbing as this seems a clear message from the Ottomans that it is once more interested in the Sunni Kurds of the North. Although the man has little support left standing in the region, the damage is likely to still be immense and should we not strike first whilst the Porte is suffering from blows in the West, we may soon find ourselves severly outgunned."
palkur.7.a:0 "Send an ultimatum!"
palkur.7.b:0 "We can not risk war for now"

palkur.8.t:0 "Iran Issues an Ultimatum"
palkur.8.d:0 "In response to the havoc caused by Simqi, the Iranian government has decided to decree a full ultimatum towards our address. Demanding an immediate withdrawal of Simqi's forces, the extradition of all Kurdish war criminals from the last two decades and an absolutely staggering amount of reparations for the supposed damage he is causing, it is clear as day that this is a declaration of war in disguise. Troop movements in Khuzestan and near Tabriz have further confirmed this suspicion and it has become fully apparent that Iranians and Turks are once more at each others throats. May Allah guide us through these troubling times!"
palkur.8.a:0 "We march on Teheran!"

palabu.1.t:0 "Operation Abu'l-A'war"
palabu.1.d:0 "Faced with the insurmountable naval dominance of the Ottoman fleet, military theorists have in cooperation with Communard attachés developped a proposal to even the playing field. As an all-out attack on the Ottoman naval station would be impossible, a more radical plan has been formed.\n\nDuring the first hours of the war, in an attempt to catch the Ottomans off guard, a detachement of naval bombers would be sent to strike the Ottoman fleet near its station at Beirut. This would subsequently be followed up by a rapid push through the Sinai and Palestine (with the assistance of Syrian cells). It is a bold plan but should it work might even persuade the Greek government to take a side and keep the Turks busy in the Aegean."
palabu.1.a:0 "Operation Abu'l-A'war is a go!"

palabu.2.t:0 "The Blackburn Baffin"
palabu.2.d:0 "The pinnacle of British Engineering, the Blackburn Baffin is a bi-plane naval bomber used in the Union of Britain. With preparations for operation Abu'l-A'war proceeding, the government of [ENG.GetLeader] has given the order to sell some of these planes to the Royal Army.\n\nTheir reliability goes without saying but many are questioning whether the planes will be able to resist Ottoman anti-air defences or their own modern and German-based airplanes."
palabu.2.a:0 "Buy 30 of them"
palabu.2.b:0 "This whole plan seems a waste of our resources..."

palabu.3.t:0 "Succesful Raid on Beirut"
palabu.3.d:0 "Flying out under the cover of darkness, 20 Baffins succesfully bombed the Ottoman fleet in its bases at Beirut. Taken by complete surprise as Turkish military command did not expect the Egyptian army to posses naval bombers, the damage was severe. Nonetheless losses were heavy on the Egyptian side as anti-air emplacements shot down 8 of the planes before they could drop their torpedoes with a further 7 failing to withdraw.\n\nAs the morning sun rose over the harbour, the gravity of the raid started to sink in. The former flagship of the Ottoman navy and pride of the Weltkrieg, the Yavuz Sultan Selim-i Evvel, received two direct hits and coupled with the damage endured during the last war was not able to remain afloat. The Sultan Abdulhamid-i Sani and Istanköy also received heavy blows, knocking them out of action for at least six months.\n\nThe attack which many deemed a certain failure has instead become a colossal victory for the Egyptians, causing great consternation from the Greek government and sending shockwaves as far as Cyprus."
palabu.3.ott:0 "We will avenge our fallen brothers!"
palabu.3.egy:0 "Onwards to final victory!"

palabu.4.t:0 "Failed Raid on Beirut"
palabu.4.d:0 "Sixteen Baffins would leave their base on the Mediterranean in the early morning and only 1 would return unscathed. The catastrophe started right at the beginning when instead of the planned 20 only 16 were able to take off. Those that did succesfully depart would see their numbers further reduced when heavy weather blew them out of course and towards the Palestinian harbour of Haifa. Mistaking a German freighter for an Ottoman destroyer and intercepted by an Ottoman fighter squadron, 5 more planes were shot out of the sky with no damage to military installations. The remaining 11 quickly turned North in an attempt to reach Beirut but Turkish pilots succeeded in shutting down their attack. A singular bi-plane was able to return unscathed to its base near Alexandria after it broke away from the main squadron following the failed raid on Haifa.\n\nMany had expected that a succesful attack would be highly unlikely but with such a crushing defeat dealt to the Egyptian airforce, morale has taken a plunge. The cat is out the bag however and as gendarmerie in Haifa inspects the damage, Egyptian troops cross the Suez. War has arrived at last."
palabu.4.ott:0 "Tonight we dine in Cairo!"
palabu.4.egy:0 "We will never forget their sacrifice!"
 
palabu.5.t:0 "Naval Repairs Completed"
palabu.5.d:0 "After the succesful Raid on Beirut only six months ago, the Istanköy and the Sultan Abdulhamid-i Sani were forced to undergo large scale repairs. The Sultan Abdulhamid-i Sani was in especially bad shape and for a time specialists believed she would just like the Yavuz capsize. Working around the clock, both ships have now been restored to a combat ready status."

### Third Arab Congress
palcon.1.t:0 "The Third Arab Congress"
palcon.1.d:0 "After the first Arab Congress of 1913 in the buildings of the Parisian Société de Géographie, the Arab nationalist movement has seen a steady rise. Changing from the initially reformist ideas ushered by its founders who wanted to tackle the status of Arab within the Ottoman Empire, the Second Arab Congress of 1927 showed the new direction the wind was blowing. Hosted in Cairo just after the succesful Egyptian revolution and Ottoman betrayal at the Suez, the dialogue was now controlled by radicals and greater Arab nationalists. Members of Al-Fatat, Hashemite exiles, Algerian revolutionaries, Palestinian desperados all came to the gathering to definitively shift the ideas of Arab nationalism. With the Italian threat dealt with and British presence in the Middle East almost fully eradicated due to the actions of Arab heroes in 1925, attention now shifted back to the Turks.\n\nAlthough the Second Congress didn't get any further than a few strongly worded letters and resolutions no one cared about, this is no longer true. The collapse of the German economy and the take-over by Turkish nationalist leader Mustafa Kemal Pasha have created a new sense of urgency across the entire Middle East. This Third Arab Congress will ultimately be little but a thinly masked attempt to combine all Arab efforts and eradicate the Turkish presence within the Mashriq. From Libya to the sands of the Arabian desert, many anxiously await the course our new Sultan will set." 
palcon.1.a:0 "Send out the invitations"

palcon.2.t:0 "Invitation to the Third Arab Congress"
palcon.2.d:0 "Organised by the Egyptian government in Cairo, the Third Arab Congress plans to unite all Arab struggles and determine the direction it needs to go in. With much of the Mashriq still suffering under the rule of the Sublime Porte and with the Arabs of the Maghreb living in a French slave state, it is clear that we as the only independent Arab powers need to combine our strengths and strive for the liberation of our brethren."

palcon.3.d:0 "As the inhabitants of the only other independent Arab state and with the Porte greatly interested in its dealings, the government of [FROM.GetLeader] has sent his representatives to Cairo.

palcon.3.a:0 "Welcome!"

palcon.4.t:0 "Yemen Sends Representatives"
palcon.4.d:0 "Despite serving as a de jure part of the Sublime Porte and refusing to assist during the Arab Revolt of 1916, it is no secret that the Yemeni foster little warm feelings for their government in Konstantiniyye. Imam [YEM.GetLeader] has therefore send his own representative to Cairo despite a warning of the Porte not to do so.\n\nUnlike some of our other Arab allies however, Yemen does not share our ambitions and remains focused inwards. Should the Ottoman government offer them a better deal than us, it would surprise no one that the Imam would bail on our plans."
palcon.4.a:0 "At least they came..."

palcon.5.t:0 "Iran Sends a Delegation"
palcon.5.d:0 "Despite not receiving an invitation to the Conference in protest to the treatment of the Khuzestan Arabs under the new government, Iran has decided to send a delegation to Cairo.\n\nA protest in the streets of Cairo, organised by Iraqi political exiles and with support from the Ittihad party, was unable to deter Sultan Farouk I who stressed the importance of Islamic solidarity in these trying times. After a short kerfuffle, the delegation was granted a seat at the table in the hopes of encouraging an open debate."

palcon.6.d:0 "Leader of the Senussi order and opponent of the Ottoman backed Ahmed Sharif I, the exiled Idris has arrived in Cairo. Backing the Entente during the Weltkrieg in their struggles on Libyan ground, the leader of the Senussi order was forced to flee into Egypt when the Italian front collapsed. By many Libyans he is however still seen as the legitimate ruler of their nation and over the years he has steadily been preparing resistance cells for his return."
palcon.6.a:0 "A true hero!"

palcon.7.t:0 "The Delegation from Syria Takes the Floor"
palcon.7.d:0 "Representing the secret organisations of Beirut and Damascus, a variety of political exiles from the Greater Syria region have attended the conference to attack Ottoman practices in their native home. The Palestinian issue featured most prominently in their speeches as they see the continued existance of the M.O.J. as a slap in the face of Muslims across the world. Syria has to be freed from Turkish tutelage which serves nothing but the treasury of [OTT.GetLeader].\n\nLess radicalised speakers were also given the floor, with even Maronite Arabs allowed to give their say on the matter. Preaching a dialogue between the various people of the Greater Syrian region and even considering an arrangement with the Jewish settlers, the debate became quite heated. After a representative from Jaffa threw a sandal at his colleague from Aleppo, a short reces was announced and the perpetrator removed from the room."
palcon.7.a:0 "We support the Syrian people!"

palcon.8.t:0 "The Delegation from Iraq Takes the Floor"
palcon.8.d:0 "After the speaker from Jerusalem finished his speech about the threat that Zionism poses to us all, the floor was granted to the delegation from Iraq. Announcing their support for our brethren in Palestine, they urged the people in the room to not ignore a second threat to the Arab people. The Iranian nation may be trying to paint itself as a friend of the Arabs but it goes without saying that it only does so to weaken its rival in Anatolia and exploit the Iraqi Arabs after the sand has settled.\n\nBefore the representative from Mosul could finish his speech however, the Iranian delegation rose up to protest against their accusations. Should we not focus on our common enemies instead of creating new ones before the first one has been dealt with? As the temperture in the room for the second time rapidly started rising, another brief reces was announced."
palcon.8.a:0 "To a free and Arab Iraq!"

palcon.9.t:0 "Ghazi bin Faisal Attends the Conference"
palcon.9.d:0 "Son of Arab hero Faisal bin Hussein who commanded the Hashemite forces during their revolt in 1916, Ghazi bin Faisal was sent to Egypt in 1920 by his grandfather Sharif Hussein when Ottoman troops marched on Mecca. Taken under the wing of Fuad I, the shy and inexperienced boy became a rallying point for Hashemite sympathisers who fled Hejaz when the Ottoman wali was installed.\n\nUsed to a life of luxury at the Egyptian court, with his various escapades published in the papers, many Hejazi see him as disillusioned and removed from the political realities of the region. His calls for a second Hejazi Revolt and an Arab state stretching from Mecca to Baghdad, whilst very passionate and only briefly interupted by a poem he wrote to honour his father, have been almost entirely diregarded by the other representatives. When his speech was finally over all representatives clapped politely."
palcon.9.a:0 "We honour the Hashemite heroes!"

palcon.10.t:0 "Farouk I Condemns the Zionist Settlers"
palcon.10.d:0 "After hearing the tragic accounts of Palestinian Arabs suffering at the hands of the international gendarmerie and seeing the latest 'data' on Jewish immigration, Sultan Farouk I finally took to the stage. Condemning the vile deeds his brothers of the faith had to endure, he promised the Syrian delegation his full support and promised that the Palestinian people would soon be liberated. A grand applause followed when all representatives gave him standing ovation.\n\nNews of his speech was recieved less well by the significant Jewish community in Egypt itself. These Jews who enjoy fairly good living conditions and political freedom under the Egyptian state, are now afraid that this open attack on the 'Jewish menace' in Palestine could send shockwaves in their direction."
palcon.10.a:0 "We support the Palestinian people!"

palcon.11.t:0 "Idris Pleads for Help"
palcon.11.d:0 "After the speech of Farouk I, the conference has taken a different turn. The charade of a cultural conference to celebrate the Arab people has been replaced with the open discussion of actions to be undertaken against those that threaten the Arab people.\n\nThe exiled Libyan leader Idris I has been building up support for well over a decade and with Ottoman garrisons in Libya becoming careless as heated political debate overtakes the capital, he plans to strike within the year and oust Ahmed Sharif I. Hearing all the kind and passionate words from the other representatives, it is now time to turn these into guns, manpower and donations to ensure his struggle is succesful."

palcon.12.d:0 "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, the time has come to show our hands and dictate the course we will be setting. We will have to thread carefully as the multitude of political groups and resistance cells which our operation relies on if we want to keep the Arab states united behind us after their liberation."

palcon.13.t:0 "Egypt Announces Its Goals"
palcon.13.d:0 "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, Egypt has finally dropped the curtain on its grand designs. As some had already feared - and others hoped - [EGY.GetLeader] has announced his ambitions to incorporate the Levant within his Sultanate. The matter of Iraq was left open but hinting at the creation of a friendly Arab regime in the region. Hejaz would furthermore be ceded to their allies on the peninsula as a payement for their help in the coming war.\n\nMany of the Syrian delegation left the conference in anger as they claim that this is just putting Syria under new management instead of granting it the self-government its people are so clearly demanding. Hejazis are not too keen either on the scheme as they see their brethren of the Arab Desert as underdevelopped and uncultured barbarians who will do more bad than good to the relatively rich coastland."
palcon.13.a:0 "Let's hope their hubris won't be our downfall"

palcon.14.t:0 "Egypt Announces Its Goals"
palcon.14.d:0 "With representatives from all corners of the Arab world brought together in Cairo, Egypt has finally dropped the curtain on its grand designs. Promoting self-government amongst the Arab states, they will strive to retain the various constituents of Arabia as individual units that can decide on their own whether to join a larger Arab state.\n\nRepresentatives from Iraq, Syria and Hejaz are pleased that they will retain the right to determine their future but on the Peninsula enthusiasm is far less high. Not only would they see no rewards from their participation in the war but furthermore they would have to contend with a powerful Hejazi state."
palcon.14.a:0 "This will be interesting to say the least"

palcon.15.t:0 "Iran Leaves the Conference"
palcon.15.d:0 "As the final resolution of the Conference seems to imply an independent Iraq free from Iranian influence, the Iranian delegation has left in anger.

palcon.15.a:0 "They weren't invited anyhow!"
palcon.15.b:0 "Reason is not something the Arabs understand!"

palcon.16.t:0 "The Matter of Socialist Support"
palcon.16.d:0 "Through the contacts of the Arab lobby in Paris and the cautious cooperation between the Commune and Egypt following the Suez Crisis, many have started to wonder to which degree the Arab cause should be linked to that of the Internationale.\n\nThe Internationale which profits directly from the rising Arab dissent in Algeria and the threat the movement poses to the German ally in Anatolia, is more than interested to provide military equipment and advisors to guide our efforts. Many fear however that there is a cost attached to these. Through a variety of economic deals, closely linked to the oil trade which has proven an important asset in the communard war machine, they see the Arabs being subdued to a new form of imperialism. Furthermore the socialist rhetoric they sprout is a direct threat to the Arab states who are built on rich and powerful aristocrats."

palcon.18.t:0 "The Conference Draws to an End"
palcon.18.d:0 "As the sun sets on the Nile, Farouk I closes the conference with another speech. Thanking all representatives for their attendance, it is to all apparent what a formidable display of Egyptian power this really was. Arabs from all groups and social standings have come to be awed by the wealth of Egypt and revel in the freedom that this truly independent Arab state provides. Furthermore Egypt has attempted to unite the different forces in the region and push them all towards an ideology most favourable to the Egyptian state itself."
palcon.18.a:0 "Look at those fireworks!"

### News events about events in Palestine
palnews.1.t:0 "American Forces Depart the M.O.J."
palnews.1.d:0 "As America descends once more into Civil War, [USA.GetLeader] has given the order to recall all active American personnel from Palestine to reinforce the homefront.\n\nHaving served as one of the most important partners in the International Gendarmerie since its inception in 1920, the withdrawal of the United States has made its forces even more thinly stretched than before. As the situation further deteriorates, German troops have been unwilling to fully retreat as public support in Germany for their involvement remains high."
palnews.1.a:0 "Johnny is marching home again"

palnews.2.t:0 "Protests Escalate in Jerusalem"
palnews.2.d:0 "Called on by local Arab notables and leaders, a mass protest was held in the city of Jerusalem earlier today to pressure the Council into the closure of the Jewish immigration office, which recently expanded its operations. What started as a peaceful protest quickly escalated after gendarmerie forces started cracking down on some of its leaders. In response the protestors started throwing stones at windows of foreign businesses and assault foreign nationals on the streets of the city.\n\nEventually the authorities were able to subdue the protest before further violence could spread but with resources spread thin, the action has scared the International Council that the situation might be far more explosive than initially thought."
palnews.2.a:0 "This is an affront to our Muslim brethren!"

palnews.3.t:0 "M.O.J. Halts Further Jewish Immigration"
palnews.3.d:0 "In response for increasing calls by the Muslim population and the Jerusalem riot only a few weeks earlier, the International Council in Jerusalem has officially decreed an end to Jewish immigration and has decreed that no further settlers will be allowed entry into the zone until an accord has been reached with the local leaders.\n\nWhilst it is unlikely to fully stop immigrants from coming in due to the limited resources of the Council to enforce the decree, this marks an important turning point in the policy of the M.O.J. and an affront to both the Balfour and Talaat declarations."
palnews.3.a:0 "Palestine will never be free so long Foreigners decide its policy"

palnews.4.t:0 "General Strike in Palestine"
palnews.4.d:0 "Organised by various Arab National Commitees a general strike of all Arabs engaged in labour, transport and shopkeeping has been called to force the departure of international forces.\n\nListing their demands as 1) Prohibition of all Jewish immigration now and in the future 2) Prohibition of the transfer of territory from Arabs to Jews 3) Immediate withdrawal of the International Gendarmerie, a vast portion of the Arab population is primed to partake in the action encouraged by religious leaders and influential families. The Council has already reported that it will crack down heavily on any attempts to force its departure and gendarmerie forces have already been sent into Jaffa to arrest possible ringleaders of the strike."
palnews.4.a:0 "May Allah bless their efforts"

palnews.5.t:0 "The Congress of Haifa Opens Its Doors"
palnews.5.d:0 "As violence continues to escalate across the region, the various signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have agreed to meet in Haifa to decide the future of the M.O.J.. The Ottomans quickly demanded the immediate reunification with Konstantiniyye, pointing out that the current chaos is fully to blame on those that took it away from the Porte in 1920. Egypt is openly calling for its attachement to Egypt, claiming that the Arabs should be united and that Ottoman actions during the Weltkrieg are what led to its creation in the first place.\n\nThe Commitee sent out to investigate the sustainability of continued operations has also returned with a negative answer, proscribing its reunification to the Ottoman Empire but with an international panel ensuring the safety of the Jewish people."
palnews.5.a:0 "Let us hope that a solution can be found"

palnews.6.t:0 "The International Council Abolishes the M.O.J."
palnews.6.d:0 "In response to issues in Palestine, the signatories of the Jerusalem Accords have voted in favour of its abolition and the reintegration into the Ottoman Empire. Proposals to return the Sinai to Egypt were vetoed by our representatives to great annoyance of both Cairo and the other powers which ultimately conceded to putting it under joint control by both nations, something those two have already denounced.\n\nWhether or not this solves the Palestine issue remains to be seen but what is for certain is that conflict between the Ottomans and Egypt is only starting."
palnews.6.a:0 "A wise decision"
palnews.6.b:0 "This is an outrage!"

palnews.7.t:0 "Failed Coup d'État in Cairo"
palnews.7.d:0 "Gunfire could be heard earlier today in Cairo as a group of conspirators stormed the palace. Calling themselves the Society of Justice, the group was planning to restore Abbas II to the throne. The last Ottoman Khedive, Abbas II has recently seen an increase in popularity across the Muslim world due to his Islamist ideas, giving rise to various groups wishing for his return.\n\nNonetheless the failed coup attempt has come to the advantage of the Cairo regime as the close relation between the Khedive and the Ottoman government has shifted public opinion squarely against the Turks. [EGY.GetLeader] himself has already called the attack on his life a vicious plan by the imperialist Turks to smother Arab independence and has reportedly starting calling for military action against the Porte."
palnews.7.a:0 "This will only further destabilise the Middle East"

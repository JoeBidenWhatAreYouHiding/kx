### Focuses ###

AFR_Nationalize_European_Companies:0 "Nationalize European Companies"
AFR_Nationalize_European_Companies_desc:0 "While direct European influence may have been banished from Africa (for the most part), they still sink their claws into our economies with their mining companies, robbing Africans of their wealth and continuing colonial practices; just in new clothing. We will never be truly free unless we are rid of these companies, they must be expelled. Africa’s economy must serve Africans first and always; not fat cats thousands of miles from our territory."
AFR_Work_with_Foreign_Mining_Concerns:0 "Work with Foreign Mining Concerns"
AFR_Work_with_Foreign_Mining_Concerns_desc:0 "We can not deny that European companies provide an important lifeline to our economy; we can not afford to simply expel them. Instead we will work hand in hand with major corporations, helping with their extraction of natural resources in exchange for a cut. While the Europeans enslaved us and our people mere years ago,we have learned that profit can ease all misfortune."
AFR_Forming_our_own_Economy:0 "Forming Our Own Economy"
AFR_Forming_our_own_Economy_desc:0 "The economies of Africa so far have been exclusively structured to support our former masters; but with them gone, we must adapt. The first step towards true de-colonization is the establishment of a truly African economy - an economy that can serve our people independently of european interests, and that can develop and expand at its own pace."
AFR_Establish_Financial_Beuracracy:0 "Establish Financial Bureaucracy "
AFR_Establish_Financial_Beuracracy_desc:0 "We currently have no real widespread and unified financial system. What little we had that remained from the colonial regimes was obliterated in the chaos of the Mittelafrikan Collapse. Our financial bureaucracy will be built from the ground up as rapidly as possible in order to get the nation on the path to prosperity as quickly as possible, or at least keep us away from an economic meltdown."
AFR_Tax_Collection:0 "Formalize Tax Collection"
AFR_Tax_Collection_desc:0 "The system of taxation in our territory is largely ad-hoc and unofficial, with local warlords taking unfair tribute for themselves. The first step towards financial stability is to establish a formal system of taxation, and formal tax codes for citizens. All taxation tied to the central government, and taxes collected will provide much needed funds for government projects. And while corruption in our systems is inevitable, strong codes and punishment for offenders will hopefully persuade officials away from the dishonest appropriation of funds."
AFR_Foreign_Support:0 "Support from Abroad" 
AFR_Foreign_Support_desc:0 "While we have made great strides in economic development, we can not reach our goals by ourselves. To help us, we have called in a foreign benefactor, who will provide loans and funds to help further build up our economy; with our financiers getting a cut from all projects constructed from foreign loans."
AFR_Roads_and_Rails:0 "Building Roads and Rails"
AFR_Roads_and_Rails_desc:0 "As it stands, the majority of Africa is mainly rural, disconnected areas, with roads and railways being few and far between, and with the majority of the transport of goods being handled by porters. While this system worked fine for our colonial overlords, now that we stand independent we must move on from development schemes only meant to benefit our oppressors. We shall embark on the construction of roads, railways, canals and other infrastructure which shall connect our people to one another, and not just our valuable resources to European ports."
AFR_Protect_Wildlife:0 "Protecting our Land and Wildlife"
AFR_Protect_Wildlife_desc:0 "Our wildlife is sacred. From the smallest hyrax to the largest elephants, the animal and plant life that form this beautiful ecosystem we live in are just as vital and important to our nation and our people as iron or air. Long have poaching, habitat destruction, and other vile practices sullied and tainted this Eden we call home. New protections shall be enacted and strictly enforced to ensure the wilds of our nation survive and thrive for generations to come."
AFR_A_Push_for_Tourism:0 "Towards a Tourism Industry"
AFR_A_Push_for_Tourism_desc:0 "Our nation is a beautiful and varied land; and as an oasis of general stability here in Africa, we could offer the people of the world a front row seat to Africa’s beauties and wonders without forcing them to confront the harsh reality and atmosphere of chaos that surrounds much of the continent. Tourism income shall become a new cornerstone of our economy."
AFR_First_Steps_towards_Industrialization:0 "The First Steps Towards Industrialization"
AFR_First_Steps_towards_Industrialization_desc:0 "While recently we have made great strides towards industrial self-sufficiency; there is still a long way to go. While soon our skies might soon be black with smog, we must focus on what our nation is rich in and invest the profits wisely. Soon our nation's march towards industrialization will enter its final chapters."
AFR_Expanded_Farming:0 "Support our Farmers"
AFR_Expanded_Farming_desc:0 "As of now we are a majority rural and agrarian nation; and while we have recently pushed to industrialized our lands, we must focus on the assets we have at our disposal currently. Our Farmers will remain a source of income for our people, selling the stocks of food not used to feed our people for a profit. In addition, we shall set up specialized agricultural courses so that new generations of farmers may till the land."
AFR_Riches_of_Africa:0 "Tap Into the Riches of Africa"
AFR_Riches_of_Africa_desc:0 "Africa as it stands is one of the most wealthy continents on the face of the planet; Europeans may have stolen our wealth for centuries, but now that Africans call the shots, the vast mineral and chemical wealth will be used to further our own economic development instead of the development of Europe. Veins of ore and oil rich areas will be exploited to their full potential, with every cent going right back to the pockets of African Citizens."
AFR_Homegrown_Industry:0 "Our own Homegrown Industry"
AFR_Homegrown_Industry_desc:0 "Our recent pushes for industrialization are beginning to bear fruit. While our methods of industrialization are different from the methods of the rest of the world, they are methods nonetheless, and we have seen great success industrializing our own way and on our own terms. Soon we will have an economy on par with the great powers of Europe."
AFR_Nationalize_Our_Infrastructure:0 "Infrastructure in the Government's Hands"
AFR_Nationalize_Our_Infrastructure_desc:0 "Privatization of vital infrastructure hasn’t done anyone any good, it has led to nothing but greedy exclusion and cut corners. We refuse to yield to major corporations in their demands for control, instead we will continue trusting our government to pass the benefits of our infrastructure down to the populace."
AFR_Private_Control_of_Infrastructure:0 "Push to Privatize our Infrastructure"
AFR_Private_Control_of_Infrastructure_desc:0 "The populace has grown tired of failing public infrastructure, and the government has found it wise to listen. We shall hand control of major infrastructure over to private interests, trusting them with the construction and maintenance of vital infrastructure such as roads, bridges and railroads. Additionally, they will flip the bill for all of this, rewarding the citizenry with a well earned tax break."
AFR_A_Booming_Economy:0 "A Booming African Economy"
AFR_A_Booming_Economy_desc:0 "Business is Booming! We have transformed our barren and plundered backwater into a flourishing haven of economic prosperity. Our people are rich, our lands are richer, and investors from around the world flock to get themselves a slice of the action. We have thrown off the legacy of economic oppression and have come out a powerful economic force that can rival even the greats."

AFR_An_African_Army:0 "An African Army"
AFR_An_African_Army_desc:0 "With the departure of colonial rule, Africa has been plunged into chaos and violence; the likes of which have never been seen before. As we try to survive the tumult that surrounds us, we must begin construct our own army, based off of the Askari and Colonial Garrisons that our former Masters have left behind."
AFR_Rehabilitare_the_Askari:0 "Rehabilitate the Askari Officers"
AFR_Rehabilitare_the_Askari_desc:0 "While the Askari may be considered traitors to some, they remain the core of Mittelafrika’s former army, and a vital resource for our fledgling new army to use. We shall re-train and re-arm the former troops that disbanded after their commanders fled, forming a powerful new core to our army."
AFR_Scavenge_German_Guns:0 "Scavenge German Weapons and Designs"
AFR_Scavenge_German_Guns_desc:0 "The German Empire stands as a global hegemon and the most powerful of our former rulers. And while German overlords might have departed, they have left behind a myriad of guns, trucks, artillery, plans, schematics and other useful equipment. To further our mastery of warfare, we shall tirelessly study and re-purpose what was left behind, using the scraps at hand while laying the groundwork for making our own copies in the future."
AFR_Foreign_Backed_Research:0 "Foreign Backed Research"
AFR_Foreign_Backed_Research_desc:0 "Almost a hundred years of colonial policies has led most of our high command clueless in the modern ways of war. Using manuals and books left behind by Germany, as well as European schools willing to accept our officers, we shall re-forge and re-train our army into an effective and modern fighting force."
AFR_Lessons_of_Tradition:0 "Lessons of Tradition"
AFR_Lessons_of_Tradition_desc:0 "While their resistance may have ultimately been futile, we can not deny the passion of our forefathers who attempted to resist European Hegemony. Even today elders with memories of anti-colonial struggle remain, we must heed their lessons and incorporate traditional tribal methods of warfare into the fabric and structure of our Armed Forces, commiting to the modernization of our methods while maintaining an important link to the past."
AFR_Mobilize_the_Villages:0 "Militarize Rural Villages"
AFR_Mobilize_the_Villages_desc:0 "The various villages, tribal kingdoms, and other small settlements that lie outside the major cities and across the countryside are a valuable and untapped asset we could utilize for our military’s gain. By offering incentives to volunteers from these population centers to join organized levees and militias, we could train the regular citizens of our nation to be able to rise up at a moments notice. By spreading this system across the entire nation, we could have an army of thousands ready to protect their nation at a moment’s notice. Every inch of our nation shall become the frontline as every volunteer rises, rifle in hand, to defend their home."
AFR_Bush_Warfare:0 "Bush Warfare"
AFR_Bush_Warfare_desc:0 "Africa is a harsh continent, with varied climates and terrains that stretch across its expansive mass. In [ROOT.GetName] and the surrounding areas, savannahs dominate the landscape with dense pockets of monsoon forest that border the North and South. These wild lands are known to our people, and thus our soldiers, just as well as they know how to breathe or run. We shall use this knowledge to form the basis of our new military doctrine. We shall become masters of the Bush itself."
AFR_Guerilla_Tactics:0 "Guerilla Tactics"
AFR_Guerilla_Tactics_desc:0 "With their deep knowledge of the local terrain and with the new tactics we have developed instilled deeply in their hearts and minds, our Defense and Security Forces have evolved into a fierce and ravenous fighting force. Each day, our militias raise from their volunteer’s barracks and drill the skills needed to defend our lands from any invader. With each drop of blood and sweat spilled, these [ROOT.GetAdjective] guerillas get one step closer to being the most feared fighting force in all of Africa!"
AFR_Victory_by_Any_Means:0 "Victory - By Any Means..."
AFR_Victory_by_Any_Means_desc:0 "Despite our modernization - Africa’s army remains archaic and not suited to European standards of warfare. While many have called this a detriment, we call it a strength. We will embrace asymmetrical warfare to its highest extent, focusing on winning our conflicts no matter how dire the price may be. "
AFR_Napalms_Aroma:0 "Napalm's Aroma"
AFR_Napalms_Aroma_desc:0 "You smell that? That’s napalm, and nothing else smells like it in the world. Requisitioned from some French friends to the North, we have been able to quietly purchase and import tons of this vitriolic compound for use against any foe foolish or daring enough to step foot past our borders without our approval. They can not run, and they can not hide, for we shall burn the jungles they scurry away too like the vermin they are as we turn the very sky red with our ordinance."
AFR_Hire_Mercs:0 "Hire Mercenaries"
AFR_Hire_Mercs_desc:0 "Mercenaries have been used in warfare ever since European feet stepped foot on African soil, providing their services as soldiers in exchange for monetary compensation. Who are we to break this tradition? The Soldier of Fortune business has been booming ever since the German administration fell, and we are happy to be their newest customers. With them on our payroll we will crush our enemies with our fierce and well trained bands of hired militants."
AFR_The_Gift_of_Gas:0 "The Gift of Gas"
AFR_The_Gift_of_Gas_desc:0 "Hermann von Göring’s administration had secretly stocked up on nocuous substances such as Mustard and Chlorine gas under the Kolonialbüro’s nose, in case of a mass uprising or other such event. While Göring’s men retreated from our lands before they had a chance to use it, these toxic substances have been sitting in store, unused by our government in an attempt to avoid stooping to the level of Göring and his lackeys. However with the fate of our nation on the line, and with seemingly no other option left, [ROOT.GetLeader] has authorized the use of gas weapons in the battlefield, in blatant violation of the previously established rules of war. May God have mercy on our souls..."

AFR_Repair_Old_Planes:0 "Repair Leftover Aircraft"
AFR_Repair_Old_Planes_desc:0 "Hermann von Göring; while proving to be instrumental in the downfall of Mittelafrika, was also an avid pilot and collector of planes and other aviation equipment. His vast collections of aircraft now lie abandoned in the various airfields scattered across the African terrain, doing nothing besides collecting dust. Repairing these old birds and getting them back in the sky will be vital for protecting our skies."
AFR_Hire_Foreign_Pilots:0 "Hire Foreign Pilots"
AFR_Hire_Foreign_Pilots_desc:0 "We have a critical lack of pilots for our small yet fierce air force; contributing to a systematic problem within our forces: a lack of experienced and well trained officers. To remedy this, we shall move to hire foreign pilots, getting men in the cockpits of our aircrafts while also helping to train a new generation of African Airmen."
AFR_Utilize_Airports:0 "Utilize Abandoned Airports"
AFR_Utilize_Airports_desc:0 "The collapse of Mittelafrika led to the abandonment of many facilities used by the armed forces of the old regime. Scattered along the African plains are several airports; airports that by now dilapidated and falling apart, however with small investments and repairs can become useful centers for our fledgeling Air Force."
AFR_Our_own_Air_Force:0 "Beginnings of an Air Force"
AFR_Our_own_Air_Force_desc:0 "While hardly an air force by European standards, we have carved a small yet proud air force out from the scraps and leftovers of old regimes. Our airmen will patrol our skies against airborne threats, decimating any who dare oppose us from above. While our planes may be rusty, and while their engines squeak and squeal every time they take off, a continual effort into maintenance and acquisition of new aircraft will keep our force functional."

AFR_Using_old_Vessels:0 "Using Old Vessels"
AFR_Using_old_Vessels_desc:0 "The majority of former Mittelafrika fleet stayed loyal to Admiral Heydrich, leaving the states borne out of the collapse with little in the way of naval assets. By scavenging abandoned crafts floating aimlessly off our coasts, we shall begin laying the groundwork for a brand new naval force capable of defending our coasts with ease."
AFR_Convert_Fishing_Boats:0 "Convert Fishing Boats"
AFR_Convert_Fishing_Boats_desc:0 "While we have little in the way of actual vessels, one thing we have an abundance of is fishing vessels; small ships with operate off our coasts in hopes of catching fish. We will use spare funds to buy these ships off of our fishermen, and adapt them to serve as naval vessels. While having a navy comprised mainly of old fishing boats with 4 inch guns bolted to their bows is far from ideal, it is the best we can do considering our circumstances."
AFR_Sell_Ship_Registrations:0 "Seize Foreign Ships"
AFR_Sell_Ship_Registrations_desc:0 "One way to increase our supply of ships is a very simple process: a process called stealing other people’s vessels. Any ships that dare venture into our coastlines without proper tribute will be seized by our coast guard and retrofitted for our naval forces. This may not be an ideal way of expanding our navy, it is the easiest way we can think of considering our limited resources; even if it comes at the cost of ships avoiding our waters."
AFR_Harass_Enemy_Ships:0 "Harassing the Enemy"
AFR_Harass_Enemy_Ships_desc:0 "While we can do little to seriously oppose a superior naval force, we can hope to harass them, making every second of naval warfare difficult for them. By using tactics such as suicide craft and hijacking, we shall inconvenience the enemy navies, enough to get them to hopefully leave us alone."

AFR_Independence:0 "Freedom, at Long Last!"
AFR_Independence_desc:0 "The great behemoth known as ‘Mittelafrika’ has finally met its untimely doom; and with its fall, we stand as a free and independent nation for the first time in over a century.

AFR_Tribal_Monarchism_desc:0 "Our noble tribe now stands free from European oppression, and [Root.GetLeader] now standing as the unhindered leader of our nation; our tribal monarchy will flourish like never before.

AFR_Empower_the_Elders:0 "Empowering the Elders"
AFR_Empower_the_Elders_desc:0 "Our tribal elders know best; drawing from decades of experience in Africa’s own unique art of governance. We shall follow their wise path as our nation is guided triumphantly into the future. After all, who needs change? The system of Tribal Monarchies has suited Africa well for hundreds of years, and will continue to serve us well for years to come; especially considering the inherently unstable nature of republican governments."
AFR_Modernized_Monarchy:0 "Modernized Tribal Monarchism"
AFR_Modernized_Monarchy_desc:0 "Our nation’s monarchy stand proudly in this new and profound era; however it does not stand as some archaic relic of a past world.

AFR_Secure_Our_Kingdom:0 "Securing our Kingdom"

Against all odds, we stand steadfast as a free, independent and undoubtedly prosperous state.\n\n Long Live [Root.GetName]!"

AFR_Cooperate_With_Other_Tribes_desc:0 "Nothing will ever be achieved by shedding more African blood; we must avoid the horrors of war, and instead focus on cooperating with our neighbors.

AFR_A_Greater_Kingdom_desc:0 "[Root.GetName] is a noble and glorious state; and with our people unshackled from the rule of oppressive colonials, we are now free to claim the full extent of our destiny.

AFR_Africas_Revolution:0 "A Revolution By Africans - For Africans"

AFR_Embrace_Pan_Africanism_desc:0 "We have increasingly come under the influence of mainline strains of Pan-Africanist thought, drawing influence from figures such as Duvalier in Haiti and Garvey in America, as well as the titans of Africa like Padmore, Nkrumah, Obama, and Kenyatta.

africa_shared.1.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Requests Aid"
africa_shared.1.d:0 "A Mittelafrika State under our influence has requested a generous sum of aid from our nation. Granting them this aid would surely draw them into our sphere, and possibly provide us with a just reward, however some have denounced any aid to [FROM.GetName] as a frivolous waste of money. Shall we grant them the aid they request?"
africa_shared.1.a:0 "Granted"
africa_shared.1.b:0 "Denied"

africa_shared.2.t:0 "Aid is Granted"
africa_shared.2.d:0 "Good news has graced the capital, as an envoy from [FROM.GetNameDef] has announced that aid shall be provided to us. This agreement will prove mutually beneficial."
africa_shared.2.a:0 "Hooray!"

africa_shared.3.t:0 "Aid is Denied"
africa_shared.3.d:0 "Unfortunately our benefactors found it wise to cut us off from any potential financial support. It seems as if we will have to look elsewhere for funds."
africa_shared.3.a:0 "Damn.."

africa_shared.4.t:0 "Our Problem with Corruption"
africa_shared.4.d:0 "The Collapse of Mittelafrika has left a significant amount of chaos in our nation’s legal and financial structures. This disorganization in our bureaucracy leaves our nation ripe for exploitation by less than reputable entities and figures. Everyone from slimy politicians, European businessmen and local warlords have been caught skimming off the top of our treasury, leaving our government severely lacking for funds. Rooting out this problem from top to bottom will take a great amount of work; joining with the graces of the corrupt could prove advantageous for our coffers."
africa_shared.4.a:0 "We Shall Root out Corruption on Every Level!"
africa_shared.4.b:0 "Perhaps we could benefit from this..."

africa_shared.10.t:0 "One Who Stops the Flow of Rivers"
africa_shared.10.d:0 "The Dark Continent is home to many mysteries and unexplainable phenomena, from the magics and wardings of Africa’s many witch doctors as seen in Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, Kenya, Congo, and beyond, to the reports of all manners of certain spirits and beasts being sighted or even worshiped like the Mau-Mau’s infamous Ghost Goat. However, one such mystery of nature that has captivated many, especially in the West, is that of Mokélé-mbembé - the One Who Stops the Flow of Rivers. A water-dwelling entity that supposedly lives in the Congo River Basin, though has had alleged sightings as far out as Gabon, Zambia, and Kamerun, Mokélé-mbembé is conflictingly referred to as a spirit or a living creature out of time equally, but regardless of its origin it is most commonly described as a large quadrupedal herbivore with smooth skin, a long neck, and either a single tooth or horn atop its head, as if it was a prehistoric Sauropod dinosaur stuck in the modern age. \n\nKnown to local tribesmen and African communities for untold centuries, the creature came into the Western mindset at the beginning of the century, being described in big-game hunter Carl Hagenback’s 1909 guide on African life called ‘Beasts and Men.’ Since then, the beast has become the fixation of not only explorers, adventurers, and hunters, but also the Young Earth Creationism movement that seeks to use the creature as proof of their bizarre theories and among cryptozoological and even reptilian-humanoid conspiracy theorist circles across the world as well. However, most credible paleontologists and biologists suspect it to be a misidentified individual specimen of megafauna like an elephant, okapi, or a hippopotamus spotted by some dimwitted tribal hunter or by someone inspired by recent paleoart depictions of dinosaurs like Brontosaurus, like the famous depiction created by famed paleoartist Charles R. Knight. Related to similar saurian cryptids described around the Congo River Basin and in Kamerun and Zambia, like the crocodile-like Nsanga and the horned and elephant-like Emela-ntouka, the Mokélé-mbembé and the creatures like it may be myth, spirit, or real beast, but we will never know unless we find it! \n\nWith our own interests and curiosity piqued by tales of this wondrous creature, and after being tipped off about its existence not only by local Lingala tribesmen but also by word and writings of other notable explorers like famous African explorer Alfred Aloyisus ‘Trader’ Horn, the famed explorer turner ethnodrama actor Hans Schomburgk, Ludwig Freiherr von Stein zu Lausnitz through the author Willy Ley, and Paul Gratz, debate has arisen within our government as to whether or not we should give this myth any stock. Should we potentially waste funding and good men in frivolous pursuit of some possibly-made up beast, or should we trek into the Dark Continent’s darkest heart ourselves to find out?"
africa_shared.10.a:0 "We will not waste time and energy on this obvious myth."
africa_shared.10.b:0 "Fund a new expedition to find the legendary creature."

africa_shared.11.t:0 "Expeditionary Woes"
africa_shared.11.d:0 "After weeks of searching through the dense jungles and swamps of the immense Congo River Basin, both by foot and by riverboat, our expedition sent to find the great mythical saurian beast Mokélé-mbembé has come up entirely empty-handed. Returning to the capital starving, diseased, exhausted, and missing more than half the men that originally left to find the creature, the Expedition for Mokélé-mbembé has been a complete disaster. With our men finding nothing more than blood-sucking leeches, parasitic bugs, carnivorous fish, predatory animals, and angry isolated tribes, our official stance towards the Mokélé-mbembé myth has become one of skepticism and angry disbelief, with [root.getleader] viewing the whole story as nothing more than a hoax. What a colossal waste of time."
africa_shared.11.a:0 "It truly was a cryptid - a false creature built on native delusions and lies."

africa_shared.12.t:0 "Hot on the Trail of Mokélé-mbembé"
africa_shared.12.d:0 "Shocking every member of the expedition and our men back home, a true lead as to the whereabouts of Mokélé-mbembé has been found. Local Lingala hunters found within a isolated village in southern Congo have given us tips that correspond with old notes mentioned in Carl Hagenback’s writings and other information given to us by Hans Schomburgk and the late Alfred Aloyisus ‘Trader’ Horn as to where the creature might be - at a isolated watering hole deep in the North Zambian jungles around Lake Bangweulu in an area mysteriously devoid of hippos and other large animals that should normally infest the region in great numbers; perhaps a sign of Mokele-mbembe? Or more likely just a coincidence caused by any number of natural factors such as rampant crocodiles, local poachers, or bizarre migrational patterns. Whatever the case, we are finally hot on the trail of Mokélé-mbembé, so off to Lake Bangweulu we go!"
africa_shared.12.a:0 "We shall find something, no matter what!"

africa_shared.13.t:0 "The Disappointment of Modern Science"
africa_shared.13.d:0 "After months of travel and exploration, the expedition finally arrived at Lake Bangweulu - the supposed site of Mokélé-mbembé’s current nesting site. Setting up a surveillance network around the isolated watering hole, our team waited for days in silent anticipation, and after so much hard work, a creature fitting Mokélé-mbembé’s sauropod-like description has finally been found! \n\nTragically, the beast in question was just a deformed elephant with one tusk and a swollen, malshapened snout on the end of its trunk. The beast had likely been spotted at strange angles when its trunk was raised in the air all this time, tricking the minds and eyes of the optimistic explorers and easily-excitable locals for decades. How this explains how some tribes have had such a beast in their local mythologies for centuries is not certain, with there being other deformed elephants and other individual specimens of megafauna over the years being the most likely answer. Whatever the case, our expedition finally can return home, and though it was all for nothing in the end, at least one of Africa’s mysteries has finally been solved."
africa_shared.13.a:0 "At least the mystery has finally been solved...or has it?"

africa_shared.14.t:0 "One of Nature’s Mysteries"
africa_shared.14.d:0 "After months of travel and exploration, the expedition finally arrived at Lake Bangweulu - the supposed site of Mokélé-mbembé’s current nesting grounds. Setting up a surveillance network around the isolated watering hole, our team waited for days in silent anticipation, and after so much hard work, a creature fitting Mokélé-mbembé’s sauropod-like description has finally been found! \n\nThough the beast could not be identified by anyone in expedition, even among our biological and ecological consultants and experienced explorers of Africa’s darkest corners, truly defying all explanation and identification as if the beast truly was a creature lost in time or even was a spirit like so many local tribals claim. However, despite our best attempts to capture it, Mokélé-mbembé escaped into the thick jungles and swamps yet again, defying modern science and civilization once more. Regardless, our expedition marches home with a certain pep in their step, excited to tell their tales of adventure to our administration and their families, with many of the men now true believers in the curious story of Mokélé-mbembé, as some believe it to be a true dinosaur lost in time and wondering if others exist out there in a small but stable population, while many others in our group believe they truly saw a tribal deity or spirit of nature walking among the living. Perhaps it was a real Saurian cryptid or some prehistoric spirit, but it would seem that we shall never know, but with this expedition the story of Mokélé-mbembé is more alive and well-known than ever before. Maybe some things are truly better when left unexplained and unexplainable."
africa_shared.14.a:0 "Perhaps some of life’s mysteries are best left unknown."

africa_shared.15.t:0 "Peace with the Portuguese?"
africa_shared.15.d:0 "After a successful campaign and full military occupation over Portugal's colonial holdings in Africa, their forces have been severely weakened and are inable to retake their colonies. Due such current conditions, we are now in the position to initiate a peace in exchange for ownership over the lands we've taken. Despite this prospect, some within our command are convinced to continue the fight, and finally erradicate the forces of imperialism once and for all. Nevertheless, how must we approach this matter?"

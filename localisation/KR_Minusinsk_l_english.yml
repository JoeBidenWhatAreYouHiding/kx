At first, they were ruled by the Abakan Steppe Duma, an administrative institution of self-government, that was established for 'nomad Inorodtsy (non-Slavic subjects of the Empire)'. When the Revolution dissolved the Empire, the Abakan Zemstvo Administration was established instead, eventually transformed into Khakas Steppe Administration. Anyway, it still was just an executive organization, rather than a territorial and national autonomy the Khakas people desired. When the region was annexed into Mongolia, even such an organization was dissolved and now, thanks to the efforts of Ivan Solovyev, it was reintroduced. Led by Stepan Maynagashev, a respected leader of the Khakas people, the Administration is looking forward to finally achieving the autonomy for Khakassia.§!"

Aleksandr Sotnikov was elected an Ataman of this Host and in the beginning of the 191 he led a cossack insurgency in Minusinsk and Krasnoyarsk. In 1925 the Yenisey Cossacks, similarly to the majority of Cossack Hosts in all of Russia, supported Admiral Kolchak, but eventually found themselves annexed into Ungern's Mongolia. While now the territory of Minusinsk is controlled by the Cossacks, there's an ongoing power struggle between the former Ataman, Aleksandr Sotnikov and the incumbent one, Ivan Solovyev. The outcome of this struggle will likely define the future of the Cossack Host.§!"

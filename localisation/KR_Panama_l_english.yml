### Leaders ###
POLITICS_JUAN_AROSEMENA_DESC:0 "Juan Arosemena, despite being politically liberal, is the leader of the Conservative faction of the Liberal party. He is popular among many Panamanians, even non-Liberals. Many see him as the only man who can lead Panama out of these trying times."
POLITICS_HARMODIO_ARIAS_MADRID_DESC:0 "Harmodio Arias Madrid is the founder of the National Revolutionary Party. Alongside his brother, Arnulfo Arias Madrid, he has led the new government since the coup in 1931. He is popular among the people, despite not having the most experience in political matters. This has led some to say that his brother, Arnulfo, would be a more effective President."
POLITICS_MANUEL_PINO_DESC:0 "Manuel Pino, the head of the National Police, has introduced many modernisations into the National Police and plans on evolving it into a true army now that he is the President. Politically, he is a wildcard. He is seen as an authoritarian brute by many in the public, but he may be willing to make a compromise with the democratic factions if it means he may stay in power..."

###Events
panama.1.t:0 "Status of Panamá"
panama.1.d:0 "In 1931, following accusations of government corruption and inability to handle the economic depression, the public rose up, led by Acción Comunal, a nationalist movement, and appointed Harmodio Arias Madrid and his National Revolutionary Party, formed from Acción Comunal itself, as leader of the Provisional Government. One year later, they held elections and the Madrid-led NRP won easily. Immediately, Madrid's government began to stimulate the economy with public work programs, improving economic conditions and creating jobs. However, despite the economic stimulation, the Panamanian economy is still struggling. The next elections are scheduled for April of 1936, four years after the first election, with economic recovery on the minds of both the parties and voters."
panama.1.a:0 "Let us hope recovery continues."

panama.2.t:0 "1936 General Elections"
panama.2.d:0 "With economic recovery finally obtainable, the 1936 elections may be the most important elections in Panamanian history. The two major parties are the National Liberal Party, led by Ricardo Joaquín Alfaro Jované, and the National Revolutionary Party, led by Harmodio Arias Madrid."
panama.2.a:0 "National Revolutionary Party."
panama.2.b:0 "National Liberal Party."

panama.3.t:0 "National Police Coup"
panama.3.d:0 "The National Police up to now have been silently sitting in the background waiting for our government to make a mistake. Now, with the country more disjointed than ever, they have stepped in to 'restore order' to Panama. This could spell the end of Panamanian democracy."
panama.3.a:0 "What?!"

panama.4.t:0 "Conservative Government"
panama.4.d:0 "Due to instability in the populace and the government, Ricardo Joaquín Alfaro Jované has been forced to resign alongside his cabinet, and has requested that Juan Arosema form a new cabinet as President. Arosema's government will likely undo many of the reforms of the Progressive government, especially those regarding the encouragement of labor unions."
panama.4.a:0 "Hopefully the worst is now over."

panama.5.t:0 "Canal in Crisis"
panama.5.d:0 "Since the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, the Panama Canal Zone has been weak and unguarded. We could seize it to protect trade along the Canal and to appease the public, whose opinion is largely against the existence of the Canal Zone."
panama.5.a:0 "Very well."

panama.6.t:0 "Canada Demands That Panama Joins the Entente"
panama.6.d:0 "The Canadians have demanded that we join the Entente so they can have the Canal under their influence. They guarantee that the Canal will remain in Panamanian hands, with a small peacekeeping force deployed to assist us. They will also likely redirect some of the canal profits to their own empire, reducing our own profits from the Canal."
panama.6.a:0 "We have no choice but to join."
panama.6.b:0 "We shall never surrender our sovereignty!"

panama.7.t:0 "Canada Demands Panama Canal"
panama.7.d:0 "The Canadians have demanded that we hand over control of the Panama Canal to them. This would essentially be a restoration of the status quo for us, with the Canal Zone acting as foreign sovereign territory. In return, the Canadians promise not to harm our sovereignty."
panama.7.a:0 "We have no choice but to accept."
panama.7.b:0 "Never again shall our lands be foreign!"

panama.8.t:0 "Canada Prepares Invasion"
panama.8.d:0 "Canada has not taken our refusal well. They have begun planning an all-out invasion to be executed within the next few days."
panama.8.a:0 "Once more unto the breach, dear friends."

panama.9.t:0 "The National Police"
panama.9.d:0 "Our policy of foreign investments does not fit well with the National Police, and they are likely to coup us, should we step too far into that direction. We should find some way to pacify them to avoid such a destabilisation."
panama.9.a:0 "Perhaps some money shall influence their viewpoint..."
panama.9.b:0 "Purge all disloyal elements!"
panama.9.c:0 "Leaving them alone is surely the best choice."

panama.10.t:0 "Status of Trade Unions"
panama.10.d:0 "Trade Unions do not have a long history in our nation. As we begin to become a truly modern, 20th century nation, it may be a good idea to emphasize the government's policy regarding unions. The conservative faction and the National Police both are strongly against unions, fearing events similar to the British and French collapses, and we'll have to deal with their opposition should we encourage unions."
panama.10.a:0 "Encourage unions, but regulate them."
panama.10.b:0 "Encourage unions and leave them unregulated."
panama.10.c:0 "Say nothing on the matter."

panama.11.t:0 "Status of Trade Unions - Followup"
panama.11.d:0 "The conservatives have long complained about our policy regarding trade unions, and strongly suggest that we simply opt to ban trade unions to preserve the de facto coalition between the conservatives and liberals."
panama.11.a:0 "Ban the unions."
panama.11.b:0 "Stay the course."

panama.12.t:0 "Status of Trade Unions - Followup"
panama.12.d:0 "Our complete removal of restrictions on trade unions is going poorly. Both the conservatives and the National Police are urging us to immediately revoke the policy, or they will be forced to take 'significant action'. Unfortunately, at this point, there truly is not much our government can do. Banning the unions would now cause widespread panic and riots, and we can really only appease one of the two factions on our back."
panama.12.a:0 "Suppress political resistance."
panama.12.b:0 "Suppress police resistance."
panama.12.c:0 "Hopefully, it will blow over."

panama.13.t:0 "Who Should We Ask to Invest?"
panama.13.d:0 "Our options for investment are quite thin since no one in Europe or Asia is particularly interested in us, and South America is dealing with its own issues."
panama.13.a:0 "Ask Canada."
panama.13.b:0 "Ask USA."

panama.14.t:0 "Panama Asks for Investment"
panama.14.d:0 "Panama has asked us for a 'generous sum' of investment money, promising profit within a year. There is an obvious benefit to this, but our economy isn't perfect at the moment."
panama.14.a:0 "Let us invest."
panama.14.b:0 "Sounds like some sort of scam."

panama.15.t:0 "Investments Declined"
panama.15.d:0 "Unfortunately, our generous request for investments have been declined."
panama.15.a:0 "Sad."

panama.16.t:0 "Investments Accepted"
panama.16.d:0 "Our investments have been accepted, and we now have funds to continue along with our plans!"
panama.16.a:0 "Excellent!"

panama.17.t:0 "Harmodio A. Madrid's Retirement"
panama.17.d:0 "Harmodio Arias Madrid has been ill for some time, and he has deemed himself unable to hold office. He is therefore retiring permanently from politics and is appointing his brother Arnulfo as the head of the PNR. Arnulfo promises some reforms to the previous PNR doctrine, although it will follow the same basic teachings."
panama.17.a:0 "Farewell, Harmodio."
panama.17.b:0 "Farewell, Harmodio."

panama.18.t:0 "Removing Progressive Reforms"
panama.18.d:0 "The Liberal government implemented several socialist reforms during their tenure, and we now have the task of removing them. The issue is, the people have become adjusted to their new reforms, and removing it could be problematic. As such, we have to choose between compromising and removing some of the reforms or removing all of them."
panama.18.a:0 "Remove all reforms!"
panama.18.b:0 "Remove only some reforms."

panama.19.t:0 "Status of the Party"
panama.19.d:0 "Many have suggested that we finally branch off of the liberal party. We have two choices to do so. We may either merge with the existing conservative party, or form a new party, which many have suggested we call the Partido Nacional Conservador, or the National Conservative Party."
panama.19.a:0 "Merge with CPN."
panama.19.b:0 "Create PNC."

panama.20.t:0 "Military Junta Established"
panama.20.d:0 "A military government has officially been established in Panama. It turns out that even the most stable of Central American democracies eventually fall to authoritarianism."
panama.20.a:0 "Stability, but at what cost?"

panama.21.t:0 "The New Constitution"
panama.21.d:0 "The military junta has been creating its own constitution for Panama. Much of it is agreed upon to be stereotypical for a military government, but there is one thing that very few agree about - elections. There are three schools of thought - we can choose to have rigged elections every four years, have no elections at all, or restore democracy with the military as a legitimate party serving the remainder of the incumbent term."
panama.21.a:0 "Let us rig future elections."
panama.21.b:0 "No elections!"
panama.21.c:0 "Free elections!"

panama.22.t:0 "[GetYear] Presidential Election"
panama.22.d:0 "It's April 20th, election day. Shops, schools, and businesses are closed as the whole populace waits for the election results. It is a particularly contested election this year, and could go any way."
panama.22.a:0 "National Revolutionary Party wins."
panama.22.b:0 "National Liberal Party wins."
panama.22.c:0 "Conservatives win."

panama.23.t:0 "1940 Presidential Election"
panama.23.d:0 "It's April 20th, election day. Shops, schools, and businesses are closed as the whole populace waits for the election results. It is a particularly contested election this year thanks to the formation of the Coalition, and the election could go either way."
panama.23.a:0 "The PNP wins."
panama.23.b:0 "The coalition wins."

panama.24.t:0 "Democratic Opposition Holds Meeting"
panama.24.d:0 "The opposing democratic parties - the Liberals, Conservatives, and the PNR, are holding a meeting to discuss their response to the surge in popularity for our government."
panama.24.a:0 "We shall keep an eye on them."

panama.25.t:0 "Opposition Forms Coalition"
panama.25.d:0 "The PNP's popularity among the people has forced the opposition to form a coalition of its own - the Constitutional Coalition. This could spell trouble for us in future elections, but their own lack of cohesion could be their undoing."
panama.25.a:0 "Arnulfo Arias Madrid shall lead the coalition!"
panama.25.b:0 "Ricardo Joaquín Alfaro Jované shall lead the coalition!"
panama.25.c:0 "Juan Demostenes Arosemena shall lead the coalition!"

panama.26.t:0 "What to Do with Land?"
panama.26.d:0 "We have zoned out and begun clearing land for the creation of new farms and factories, but this leaves us with an important question. What do we do with the land? We could either choose to give the land to corporations and farmers, or choose to keep it for ourselves."
panama.26.a:0 "State-owned."
panama.26.b:0 "Private-owned."

panama.27.t:0 "Land Clearing"
panama.27.d:0 "As part of our ambitious modernisation project, we must clear some of the jungle in our nation. Our politicians, however, are debating on whether we should prioritize agriculture or industry. Industry would likely take more time, but would leave us more modernized, while farming has near-immediate bonuses and gives us more crops to export worldwide."
panama.27.a:0 "Prioritize Industry."
panama.27.b:0 "Prioritize Agriculture."

panama.28.t:0 "The Union Compromise"
panama.28.d:0 "So far, the coalition has been very successful in dealing with major political issues. Now, we face one of our largest, the status of trade unions. Overall, there are three reasonable ideas. We could either create government-owned trade unions, which allows us to have control over the unions while still protecting the workers, or we could allow unions with some safeguards in place to ensure stability, or we may simply leave them disallowed."
panama.28.a:0 "Create government-owned unions."
panama.28.b:0 "Allow unions."
panama.28.c:0 "Ban unions."

panama.29.t:0 "The Constitutional Coalition"
panama.29.d:0 "So far, we have managed to hold the coalition together reasonably well, but with our victory over the PNP, bickering among the many factions has become common. It may be advantageous for us to split the coalition now that we have dethroned the military from our country. We may, however, never again have the opportunity to unify our politics under such a popular system, so it may also be worth it to stick with the coalition and hope it holds together."
panama.29.a:0 "The coalition stays!"
panama.29.b:0 "Dissolve the coalition!"
panama.29.c:0 "Dissolve the coalition!"

panama.30.t:0 "Panama Pressures Coto!"
panama.30.d:0 "The Panamanians have launched a small-scale military assault on the Coto region, which they have claimed for a long time now. If we are not careful, this could escalate to a large-scale conflict. Fortunately, thanks to the Monroe Doctrine, the US will likely put an end to this rather quickly."
panama.30.a:0 "Those Panamaniacs!" #We must prepare for war.

panama.31.t:0 "Panama Pressures Costa Rica"
panama.31.d:0 "The Panamanians have begun a small-scale military assault on the Coto region of Costa Rica, which they have had a claim on for some time. We should threaten intervention to prevent this turning into a full-scale war."
panama.31.a:0 "Let us intervene."

panama.32.t:0 "The US Threatens Us!"
panama.32.d:0 "The United States has decided to threaten us, and has ordered us to turn our troops back or to suffer the consequences. We are now forced to obey the order, as our military forces do not stand a chance against the might of the USA."
panama.32.a:0 "Issue the retreat."

panama.33.t:0 "The US Intervenes!"
panama.33.d:0 "The US has intervened on our behalf, and is ordering Panama to restore the status quo. They would be fools not to comply."
panama.33.a:0 "Let us hope this stability remains."

panama.34.t:0 "The Coto Region"
panama.34.d:0 "The Coto Region of Costa Rica has been legitimately claimed by us for many years now, and many in the newly elected government feel now may be the time to attempt to take it back."
panama.34.a:0 "Perhaps it is time to pressure the region."

panama.35.t:0 "Panama Requests Investments"
panama.35.d:0 "Panamanian diplomats have come to us requesting investments, claiming that, after a short period in the red, we will profit greatly from investing."
panama.35.a:0 "Okay, sure!"
panama.35.b:0 "Sounds like a scam."

panama.36.t:0 "Investments Allowed!"
panama.36.d:0 "Businessmen have scrambled into our country, and are investing money into our own businesses. The economy is thriving, and hopefully both sides will profit greatly."
panama.36.a:0 "Excellent!"

panama.37.t:0 "Investments Denied"
panama.37.d:0 "Sadly, our request for investments has been declined. Neither side will be profiting from the other any time soon."
panama.37.a:0 "Unfortunate."

panama.40.t:0 "Panama Backs Down"
panama.40.d:0 "After hearing of American support for Costa Rica, and not willing to escalate the situation into a full-blown conflict, the forces of Panama have begun to back down across the region. This is a victory for American diplomacy abroad."
panama.40.a:0 "The Monroe Doctrine stands."

panama.99.t:0 "Panama Seizes Canal"
panama.99.d:0 "Upon the start of the American Civil War, Panama took the 13-mile long Panama Canal Zone from the US, officially to 'safeguard it from radicalism'. This could be advantageous for us, as we could demand that Panama either joins the Entente or hands over the Canal, and they would not be in a good position to refuse."
panama.99.c:0 "Leave them alone."
panama.99.b:0 "Demand they join the Entente and redirect some trade to the Entente."
panama.99.a:0 "Demand the canal outright."

panama.100.t:0 "Panama Seizes Canal"
panama.100.d:0 "Upon the start of the American Civil War, Panama took the 13-mile long Panama Canal Zone from the US, officially to 'safeguard it from radicalism'. Unfortunately, there really isn't much we can do about this for the time being, as we have a civil war to fight."
panama.100.a:0 "Oh well."

panama.101.t:0 "Panama Agrees to Terms"
panama.101.d:0 "Panama has agreed to our generous terms, and we now have the Panama Canal under our influence."
panama.101.a:0 "Excellent."

panama.102.t:0 "Panama Declines Terms"
panama.102.d:0 "Despite our highly generous terms, Panama has declined our request to have the Panama Canal in our sphere of influence. We can either admit defeat or prepare an invasion."
panama.102.a:0 "Onwards!"
panama.102.b:0 "Do nothing."

panama.103.t:0 "Calls for Peace"
panama.103.d:0 "Throughout our country and Canada, the populace calls for an end to the war. We should take advantage of this and propose a peace to the Canadians."
panama.103.a:0 "Send the proposal."

panama.104.t:0 "Panama Proposes a Peace"
panama.104.d:0 "Resounding calls for peace have surfaced in both our nations, and Panama has taken advantage of this to publicly propose peace. We can either accept a white peace or continue fighting to the bitter end."
panama.104.a:0 "Let us lower our arms."
panama.104.b:0 "Not until we are in Panama City!"

panama.105.t:0 "Peace in Panama"
panama.105.d:0 "Panama has triumphed over an invading foreign power! We have shown the world our might, protected our sovereignty, and kept the Panama Canal's profits!"
panama.105.a:0 "Peace is soon at hand."

panama.106.t:0 "Canada Stands Down"
panama.106.d:0 "Canada has decided against any further action following our refusal of their demand."
panama.106.a:0 "Lucky for them."

panama.107.t:0 "Panama Renounces Monroe Doctrine"
panama.107.d:0 "Panama has renounced the Monroe Doctrine, citing that, since all surrounding countries have done so, they should also do so to ensure their own safety."
panama.107.a:0 "A shame."

However, since the police assisted the public coup in the early 1930s, spending on the National Police has increased, and officers have attended several other Latin American military academies, turning it into a de facto army that could overthrow any government that it considers to be out of line.\n§RShould a civilian government mismanage a situation or stray too far into radicalism, the National Police can coup the government.§!"

POLITICS_JHOOVER_DESC:0 "Standing as the new face of the Canal Garrison, John Edgar Hoover now lords over Panama as his personal playground, for with Schley out of the picture, Hoover is finally free to run this FBI-backed Blacksite as he truly sees fit. Born in 1895 on New Year’s Day in the nation’s now-burning capital of Washington, D.C., Hoover was immersed in the glow of American leadership and government from birth. Getting his start in government young, he began work at the Library of Congress at age 18, using his salary to pay his way through law school. Immediately after graduation, the young Hoover dived into governmental work in the War Emergency Division, earning a name for himself until at the young age of 24 when he was named the head of the Bureau of Investigation’s General Intelligence Division. Proving himself as an expert lawman, detective, and clerk, this position catapulted the young Hoover’s career until, after beating back both gangs and mobsters in DC and NYC - especially during the Palmer Raids - Hoover was chosen to lead the newly created FBI. Now just over a year into his new position, Hoover has come to Panama tracking down leads of illicit dealings and potential contacts that may help the American war effort and the viability of the Panama Garrison. Instead, he has capitalized on the illegal drug, weapons, and human trafficking rings set up to pay for the Garrison, and has begun to carve out his own criminal empire, all funded and protected by the American military, for though he pockets much of the Garrison’s profits, much still flows home to Washington. With this new King of Crime in charge, the Canal has seen more business than ever, but at what cost..."


POLITICS_DRUG_SCHLEY_DESC:0 "Commanding over the Panama Garrison as the professional face of this newly-minted venture, Julian Larcombe Schley is the main face of the American Canal Authority. Born in 1880 in Savannah, Georgia and attending West Point as a young man, Schley began his military career young, joining the Army Corps of Engineers upon graduation. Classmates and good friends with Douglas MacArthur, the two served and trained together in New Orleans, Cuba, Haiti, and the Philippines, where Schley picked up his knack for working efficiently and diligently in America’s far-off tropical possessions.\n\nFollowing the Weltkrieg, in which Schley was a member of the attache sent to aid the British and French forces before their fall, Schley was sent to the Canal to serve as Governor of the Canal Zone and as main go-between with the Panamanian government. Since his promotion, Schley has lorded over the Canal Authority, running the base like a well-oiled machine, and now with the seizure of total power in Panama by the Americans, he stands as the sole face of power within the nation. Under his watch, dubious and illicit activities are maintained but kept in check in order to properly fund the Garrison, and his staunch, non-nonsense attitude has kept the worst signs of internal corruption at bay. However, with new allies arriving on these shores, it may be difficult for Schley to keep the Garrison entirely above board, or himself entirely in control."

canalzone.1.t:0 "Zone Authority Declares the Panama Zone"
canalzone.1.d:0 "The Americans from the canal zone authority have defeated our forces and seized our capitol, only keeping some of our old leaders to ensure there remains a bureaucracy for them to leash and control. The Americans have made sure we understand we are fully under their boot, by declaring the Panama Zone, now having an official reach over our entire nation.\n\nWith all this new land under the garrison’s control, issues have propped up pertaining to their budget. In the simplest of terms, they can’t afford to hold the infrastructure of the nation up themselves, unless they were to achieve money in an unexpected way. Already rumors exist that the Americans are sending men to control plantations and switch their production to drug and tobacco crops."
canalzone.1.a:0 "An interesting scheme."

canalzone.2.t:0 "Panama Canal Zone Authority Protests Occupation."
canalzone.2.d:0 "We have received telegrams of complaint from the Panama Canal Zone Authority, that authority being the American garrison in charge of holding the canal. However with the chaos in Washington and the wider US, our government has seen fit to send a letter stating we are taking control of the canal and moving in local police forces. While no fighting has occurred yet and nothing went bad as our police forces walked into the areas normally patrolled by American troops, they still appear to be anxious that we are moving into control of their zone, so it remains to be seen what will happen."
canalzone.2.a:0 "Let them stay."
canalzone.2.b:0 "Evict them."

canalzone.3.t:0 "Zone Garrison on the Move"
canalzone.3.d:0 "Reports have flooded into the government as urgent reports come in as we receive word that the American garrison in the Canal Zone are marching on our capital. Any attempts to reach the garrison’s commanders have failed, and now many government ministers are suggesting we order the police and few military units in the area to engage them, as this is technically an invasion of our capitol."
canalzone.3.a:0 "They do have their duty"
canalzone.3.b:0 "Shoot them, or something!"

canalzone.4.t:0 "Battle for the Capital"
canalzone.4.d:0 "Shots ring throughout the capital as the American garrison pushes ever onward and engages our own defence forces. Losses are mounting for both sides and getting any type of info on it is chaotic, besides that their forces are still attempting to push up the streets towards our government’s buildings and courthouses. Some government ministers have already fled in their vehicles out of the city while others remain, trying to coordinate efforts to fight back against the Americans.\n\nOur police and defence forces hold key intersections and road junctions in attempts to slow and stop the Americans advance. Tactics on both sides are tested as the Americans show skill at overrunning or utilizing superior firepower in flushing out our defensive positions, while in other parts of the city we have managed to ambush American command vehicles and squads of men pushing forward on uncleared streets. The chaos of the running battles rises as it spills out onto more streets and plaza’s, and now it appears the fate of the battle is all up to the individual as getting a clear strategic view is impossible."
canalzone.4.a:0 "The capital has fallen!"
canalzone.4.b:0 "We held back the Zone Garrison!"

canalzone.5.t:0 "Future of the Zone"
canalzone.5.d:0 "Having stabilised the nation and consolidated control from any threats we may face, such as the few Socialist cells, we can now deal with another pressing issue at hand; if we want to survive and thrive, we will need more international recognition. The obvious choice would have to be courting Canada and the wider Entente, and doing so would not be too difficult considering their obvious interest in the Canal. However, an alternative path lies before us. With the United States in chaos, we could promote ourselves as the sole successor of their principles and virtues to the wider world, and adopt more American tenets into our system of governance. Perhaps this could attract particular individuals who may invest heavily to preserve such ideals..."

canalzone.6.t:0 "To Lead a Zone within a State..."
canalzone.6.d:0 "So far, it is safe to say that we have been quite successful in controlling the nation - the people are not as rowdy, and the money is starting to flow again through our under-the-table operations. However, some figures within the Canal Zone Authority have begun the discussion of perhaps giving the state a ‘facelift’ of sorts. The argument is quite split; there are those who believe that our legitimacy can be solidified through a ‘pseudo-civilian’ government, rather than what is essentially a military junta. Others have suggested that we further strengthen our bonds with the FBI and invite their contacts within the government itself as a means of crushing any potential forces that may arise to threaten our rule. A few members have even suggested inviting the legitimate President of the United States to take the reigns of the nation, protecting our image as the rightful heirs of America."
canalzone.6.a:0 "A ‘new’ government shall be formed with Mr. Schley as our President!"

canalzone.7.t:0 "A Public Face"
canalzone.7.d:0 "With Julian Larcombe Schley officially inaugurated as President, we have now officially transitioned from a military government to a civilian one, and democracy has finally returned to Panama! At least, in the eyes of the international community and most Panamanians. Behind closed doors, our operations are running just as they were, just with our men in their Sunday bests rather than their fatigues. It seems to have worked quite well too, with citizens celebrating in the streets and appraisal coming in from Democracies around the world. Now we won’t have to worry so much in regards to prying eyes and protests."
canalzone.7.a:0 "The more things change the more they stay the same."

canalzone.8.t:0 "Change Is Unnecessary"
canalzone.8.d:0 "Following a brief deliberation amongst the leaders of the Canal Zone Authority, a conclusion to maintain the current status of the state was met. Though we may still face occasional outcry from our citizens and the international community, it’s nothing but smoke and mirrors, and not something a few battalions of soldiers can’t fix. Besides, we are doing fine as it is - and it’s time that the people of Panama, and the world, accept that one way or another."
canalzone.8.a:0 "Power and wealth are all that matters." 

canalzone.9.t:0 "Relinquishing Control to the FBI"
canalzone.9.d:0 "It’s difficult to say that the FBI has not done us more than a few favours when it comes to keeping us in power. Their array of expertise can definitely be put to good use if it were to be administered directly from the state. To that end, a private contract was struck up under closed doors with the director of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover, where all powers of the state would be handed over to him and his organisation in exchange for a hefty sum and a nice place in the Bahamas for the members of the Canal Authority. With a short, formal transition of power, Hoover and his agents now have complete reign over the Panama Zone. Whatever that means for its citizens, nobody knows..."

canalzone.10.d:0 "It may be a ludicrous idea, but we live in ludicrous times where the United States has fallen, and we are the only ones who can pick up the pieces to form a new Union! The only feasible way we can do so without immediate condemnation is to invite the president of the United States to publicly 'form a new government' in his name. However, his name and image is the only thing we need - there is no intention to truly let him take control after all. How else could we continue our covert drug-dealings? After all, we only need a good figurehead to keep attention away from our main source of income, and to bolster our own legitimacy as a state. The only question is...who do we consider the legitimate President of the United States? A potential candidate is Al Smith who is currently residing in Panama, and it wouldn’t be too hard to portray him as a legitimate candidate, due to the controversy of the ‘28 election. However, many other choices remain..."

canalzone.12.t:0 "Bridging the Darién Gap"
canalzone.12.d:0 "It’s obvious that, while our drug-trafficking operations are going splendidly as it is, we can always push for more. A recent report has discovered that we could have a much easier access to our supplies if we were to simply cross the treacherous Darién Gap. To do that, we will have to take control of Chocó, just across from Darién. Our options in regards to how we can take the land for ourselves are obviously limited; either we can declare war for it with some casus belli we can conjure up, or rather reserve our resources for another day and instead pressure the current occupiers of Chocó to give the land up peacefully, though we cannot be certain they will agree to such terms."
canalzone.12.a:0 "A good war will solve this nice and quick. To arms!"
canalzone.12.b:0 "They already fear us, let’s ‘negotiate’ for it."

canalzone.13.t:0 "Panama Demands Chocó!"
canalzone.13.d:0 "Ever since the Panama Authority had been formed, we have had our gaze sharply placed on them and their actions. It’s obvious to everyone in South and Central America that they are nothing but a rogue state only surviving off the profits of its drug-trafficking. However, their ambitions have seemed to grow far more than anticipated, as an emissary has delivered the message that their government has demanded Chocó, under the threat of war! How are we to respond to such a preposterous threat?"
canalzone.13.a:0 "We can’t take the risk..."
canalzone.13.b:0 "We aren’t going to submit to propped-up drug-lords!"

canalzone.14.t:0 "Chocó Is Ours!"
canalzone.14.d:0 "To the relief of all, and the surprise of some, the original occupiers of Chocó have transferred the entirety of the state straight into our hands, even if begrudgingly. Now we have finally crossed the Darién Gap, and our drug operations can reach new heights like never before!"
canalzone.14.a:0 "I love drugs almost as much as I love money."

canalzone.15.t:0 "They Won’t Give It Up!"
canalzone.15.d:0 "It seems that Chocó is more valuable to our southern neighbour than we had originally anticipated! With a stern reply of denial, we are left to make the final decision on the matter - do we pull the trigger and fight for the land, or have we begun to see signs of our streak of luck running out? If we stop here, there’s little else we can do to further boost our operations and our profits..."
canalzone.15.a:0 "They won’t stop me from getting my drugs!"
canalzone.15.b:0 "Perhaps we are getting ahead of ourselves."

canalzone.16.t:0 "Ignoring the Right People"
canalzone.16.d:0 "To stay in a business like this, you need to keep your hands dirty, and keep shaking them with other dirty hands. Only then can we assure that our system is free of any potential ‘do-gooders’ who may risk destroying everything we have built out of some childish sense of altruism. It also means we won’t have to dig as many graves as we usually have to. If we keep our circle of trust and connections with those who are just as deep in crime as we are, we can guarantee a mutual trust of sorts that keeps us all safe."
canalzone.16.a:0 "We’re all in this together, am I right?"

canalzone.17.t:0 "Ignoring the Ships"
canalzone.17.d:0 "It’s obvious that our under-the-table dealings don’t make us mavericks. Other like-minded people have seen the potential in selling drugs, and their methods are short of ingenious; through a system of small-time fishing ships and inconspicuous trading boats, tons and tons of illegal ‘goods’ are smuggled from ocean to ocean. However, we can’t afford to have competition, and we have the facilities to monopolise the drug-trade, with the use of higher-class ships, perhaps even fleets of drug-runners. Not only that, we can seize these ships for ourselves, and confiscate whatever goods they might hold. We know just what to do with it all."
canalzone.17.a:0 "There can be only one!"

canalzone.18.t:0 "We Need Cash"
canalzone.18.d:0 "With our recent consolidation of Panama, much of our resources have been poured into keeping the state under our control, and our control only. Keeping the reds at bay, playing privy to the international community, has shown that we are in dire need of money, and quickly. However, there seems to be a solution, a controversial one; drugs. Easy to make and easier to sell, there’s a potential for us to create a monopoly in the region, and get all the necessary funds we need for our future. Some have raised concerns regarding if this is really the right decision - but then again, it’s for the greater good... right?"
canalzone.18.a:0 "For the greater good!"

canalzone.19.t:0 "Open for Business"
canalzone.19.d:0 "With the collapse of the United States, businesses have been fleeing in droves in search of more profitable fields to conduct in. How could we ever miss the opportunity to graciously invite these corporations to our door? So far, it has been a major success - new factories under American labels have been sprouting up across the nation, granting profit to these corporations, jobs to the people, and free factories for our usage!"
canalzone.19.a:0 "A win-win situation."

canalzone.20.t:0 "A Home Away from Home"
canalzone.20.d:0 "Against all odds, we have done it. Panama is no longer an irrelevant piece of land, but instead a thriving ‘Little America’! Built on the backs of countless corpses and copious amounts of drugs, we have achieved prosperity unseen anywhere else on the continent! At least, in the cities. Outside of Panama City, drug-related crimes have risen greatly, and the number of citizens admitted to hospitals over drug-abuse is soaring. This is not too much of a concern, though; we will get to help the people any day now, just as soon as we consolidate our ever-growing economy."
canalzone.20.a:0 "Money makes the world go round."

canalzone.21.t:0 "Quid Pro Quo"
canalzone.21.d:0 "Our recent entrance into the Entente have granted us many allies, allies who use our Canal as a vital route of trade and military fleets. However, their access isn’t out of some kindness - in exchange for unrestricted access across the Canal, the representatives of the Entente nations have hesitantly agreed to cooperate with us in our own expeditions into the wild and wealthy world of the drug-trade. By cooperation, we mean turning a blind-eye. After all, they wouldn’t want to lose valuable face to the international community if they were revealed to be involved in such a scandal."
canalzone.21.a:0 "Ignorance is bliss."

canalzone.22.t:0 "Dominion of Central America?"
canalzone.22.d:0 "With our recent pacification of Central America, our government has been met with a new issue. When our influence consisted of Panama, it was still difficult to sweep our underground drug-empire under the rug. Now with the entirety of Central America under our dominion, this almost seems like an impossibility. However, there appears to be a potential opportunity to solve this. Due to our close connections with the Entente, some have suggested that we fully embrace this role to further deviate attention. This would mean officially kneeling to King Edward in Canada, and proclaiming a new British Dominion. It seems almost unfathomable, but it might just work."
canalzone.22.a:0 "Worth a shot. Long live the King!"
canalzone.22.b:0 "Who do you do think we are? Canadian lapdogs?"

canalzone.23.t:0 "The ‘Republic’ Unites Central America!"
canalzone.23.d:0 "After some long and brutal wars against our northern brethren, we have finally united Central America in the name of democracy... and the lesser known name of our drug empire. It won’t be hard to continue operations as it always has been; the people will finally experience a Central America that praises republicanism, and we get a much bigger target audience for our most valued ‘exports’. In the end, the real black gold was actually black tar heroin."
canalzone.23.a:0 "Democracy is the most powerful drug."

canalzone.24.t:0 "Dawn of the Central American Zone"
canalzone.24.d:0 "At the behest of our constantly expanding ambitions, we have finally subjugated the entirety of Central America under our rule. While resistance may lie in the deeper jungles of the region, our position is strong enough to expand our official administration, and now the Panama Zone is the Central America Zone. Some have called our victory a ‘tragedy’, but they will be left in the dust once we get the drug business booming, grander than ever. Soon, our influence and our ‘exports’ will infiltrate the world before its very eyes!"
canalzone.24.a:0 "The grind never ends."

canalzone.25.t:0 "The FBI in Central America"
canalzone.25.d:0 "Through an arduous process of dealing with the other Central American nations through negotiation, sabotage, and implicit dealings, we have finally brought the region under our heels. The cooperation of regional governors who answer only to us is proving to work fine - after all, why would they turn against the very people who put them in power? In the end, it doesn’t matter. We have eyes and ears in all parts of Central America, spies around every corner. Some say that no one can be trusted anymore, but we know better..."
canalzone.25.a:0 "...after all, we’re here to help."

canalzone.26.t:0 "God Bless the United States of Central America."
canalzone.26.d:0 "Our expansion northwards has proven to be a major success - already our citizens are celebrating in Panama City, colloquially known nowadays as the ‘New District of Colombia’. With a grandiose speech of victory from the President himself, operations have already begun to introduce American immigrants who are fleeing the Second American Civil War in greater numbers than ever to our newly consolidated lands. Other operations on the sly include a massive buildup of our drug industry; we might not have made it to where we are without it. Who knows what can come next - perhaps the American Dream can still live on, in the heart of these States of Central America."

canalzone.31.t:0 "Scarface’s Panama"
canalzone.31.d:0 "With our mandate secured, we have moved to invite the one true president of America - Alphonse Gabriel Capone - to serve as the facade of legitimacy for our state, for only a man as intelligent, as well connected, and as morally ambiguous as Capone could ever deem our venture here fully sound. Although the right and honorable Julian Schley sees himself as above the criminal enterprises that keep the Panama Garrison afloat, we know that a criminal mastermind as notorious as Scarface could not shy away from a lucrative and strings-free enterprise such as this. Despite the fact that it is not likely that Al Capone shall ever earn his rightful place in the White House or even ever visit our far-off tropical paradise while he is so busy on the mainland, we have still decided to throw our lot in with him regardless, for he is the one true and rightful leader of the Free World - and likely the only presidential candidate who would put up with the crimes we must commit in order to survive.\n\nTo commemorate this occasion, and to pay tacit attention to our proclamation, the Chicago Outfit - Capone’s criminal gang turned ‘Socialist’ terror cell - has decided to send an envoy to the Canal to witness our venture firsthand, and to see if any money is to be made for themselves and their cause. Arriving by prop plane under the dead of night, Frank Nitti and Jimmy Hoffa have come to Panama, and have been doted on hand and foot by our staff in order to court their favor. Loosening them up with good blow, smoke, and drink, we have managed to hammer out an agreeable deal with these mafiosos-turned-totalists, and now we look forward to future cooperation and dealings."
canalzone.31.a:0 "The start of a beautiful friendship."

canalzone.32.t:0 "Harsh and Illicit Realities"
canalzone.32.d:0 "Here in our tropical paradise, Julian Larcombe Schley is the law. He rules the Panama Garrison like a well-oiled machine, with not a single ounce of resources going to waste under his watch, and with all funds finding their appropriate place to fuel the war effort. However, where these funds come from is an entirely different story. The vast majority of the Panama Garrison’s economy is built on the back of the old Banana and cash crop industry, the income from the canal, and not - most dubiously of all - from a vast array of criminal enterprises maintained by the Garrison Command. Though Governor Schley is entirely against these practices, only seeing them as a necessary evil to keep the Garrison alive while not personally profiting from it at all, these practices still continue, forcing Schley into a moral dilemma as he struggles with the stress of rule.\n\nHowever, below the surface, the Garrison’s command staff are not all as nearly as squeaky clean as Schley. Another major figure within the Panama Garrison is John Edgar Hoover, an influential lawman who has risen to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigations after becoming famous busting Depression-era gangsters. Though a determined federal agent, Hoover also has a reputation for corrupt acts and self-indulgence, and has been caught before skimming funds from the Garrison’s illicit activities for his own coffers, as well as for the budget for the FBI and OSS. Additionally, there have even been rumors of some more illicit, scandalous activities taking up Hoover's personal time. As Schley continues these operations for the good of the Garrison, he must keep a vigilant watch of J. Edgar Hoover and his rising ambitions and greed."
canalzone.32.a:0 "Keep an eye on that lawman."

canalzone.33.t:0 "The Crime-King of Panama"
canalzone.33.d:0 "With Governor Schley out of the way and with his rule now consolidated, J. Edgar Hoover now stands as the Governor of Panama, and the new Crimelord of the Canal. With his rule solidified, all reservations on the Garrison’s illegal activities have been lifted as Panama rapidly transitions into a true criminal paradise. Gambling, human trafficking, gun-running, drug dealing, and more have become legitimate and state-supported sources of income, as long as Hoover and his goons get a slice of the action. Furthermore, the Canal’s rates have skyrocketed as Hoover begins to extort the world trade network in order to fuel his growing appetite for ever-higher profits.\n\nAtop his pile of plunder and treasure, Hoover now reigns over Panama as a modern criminal-king. So affluent and prosperous have these new ventures made him that in the cooler months in Panama’s high mountains, Hoover burns his excess money for warmth in his palatial manor where all sorts of dubious and scandalous activities are said to be delved in. Rumors have abounded that he takes in so much cash that he spends hundreds upon hundreds of dollars on rubber bands alone just to bundle all of his own cash. He has even begun to tickle his most wild fantasies, building himself his own zoo and importing dangerous wildlife from Australia and Africa to fill its enclosures. Most striking of these immigrant species has been the small herd of hippopotamuses Hoover had imported, which have begun to establish a native breeding population within the swamps and wetlands of Panama around the canal and within the Daren Gap. All of these fanciful projects and more would cripple the finances of less men, but not Hoover, for his fortune is great and his income is seemingly unending. With the American military remnant and his agents at his disposal, all kept loyal with these bountiful profits, Hoover’s word has become law, and all of Panama is now bent to his will."
canalzone.33.a:0 "All hail the King!"

canalzone.34.t:0 "Big Bill’s Panamanian Playground"
canalzone.34.d:0 "Long a champion of the downtrodden and the common man, none could have expected the Panama Garrison to choose William Dudley ‘Big Bill’ Haywood as the declared ‘rightful President’ of our little slice of Americana in exile. Long despising war and unnecessary violence, Haywood has become horrified by the burning maelstrom of chaos that now sweeps across the lands of old America, and from Chicago, he and his allies in the IWW and the wider array of Socialist and Syndicalist unions across the burning Union have now taken up arms to fight for their right to survive, and willing to do anything to do so. This desperation and need for allies has brought Big Bill’s associates here to the Canal, as they seek any channel of support they can muster to help feed their flame of rebellion. By declaring Haywood the rightful President of our exiled Garrison, many hope to jump on the bandwagon of good feelings and righteous causes the CSA espouses as they cut down their fellow Americans without mercy - a thin facade of accountability and good wholesome Socialist populism to cover the illicit activities we commit here for the good of the Garrison and the American people. In return for this crimson cover, we have agreed to send shipments of extra guns and war supplies sourced through our gun-running trade to help the aging Big Bill, for only he can save America, but with his advanced age and failing health, the time is ticking for old Haywood. With the Garrison barely agreeing on choosing Haywood in the first place, with the conservatives only budging out of necessity to keep unity within our ranks, and with his likely heir John ‘Jack’ Silas Reed being the laughing stock of America’s Socialist movement, Haywood is the only Red President the Garrison, and likely most of America, would ever accept. Let us hope this cooperation proves fruitful, for the good of all Americans."

canalzone.35.d:0 "A farmer since he was a boy, a lawyer since he was a man, and a President just recently, Alfalfa Bill has led a curious life that is unexpected of a poor boy from small town Texas. After a quite cordial visit to Panama from an Atlanta delegation, the Garrison agreed to throw their support under the leader of the Old Democratic Party. The conservative elements of the Garrison appreciate Murray's history with agriculture in Texas and Oklahoma, and are hopeful that he is open-minded towards a different kind of "farming" that is done in Panama, while the few members of the left view his experience with Latin American diplomacy in Bolivia as at least one positive thing to take away. And if anything is to be clear-cut, it's that Murray will bring his own brand of enforcement down South. As Governor, he deployed the National Guard a record amount of times to keep the peace, and the Garrison hopes that he will assert control in Panama as well. Beset by revolutionaries and tyrants alike, the Constitutional Republic needs all the help it can get, and the Panamanians are willing to oblige. Our gun-running operations and "agriculture" booms have become a great boon for the relatively weak southern economy compared to the industrialists in the north. Hopefully, with our support behind him, Murray can wrest control of the States and bring prosperity to Americans and us alike."

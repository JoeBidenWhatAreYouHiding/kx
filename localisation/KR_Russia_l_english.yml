russia.1.t:0 "A Troubled History"
russia.1.d:0 "After the October Revolution Anti-Bolshevik forces started to consolidate across the former Russian Empire, leading to a massive rebellion against the Soviet Republic in Siberia, and the Don and Kuban steppes during the middle of 1918. The White movement made considerable gains, but could not defeat the well placed Red Army, which still dominated the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. The war changed when the German Empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, intervened on behalf of the Whites in exchange for recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By January 1920, both Moscow and Petrograd had fallen to the White forces. The majority of White leaders decided to hold the Constituent Assembly, and, as a result, a new Russian Republic was established in the former Imperial capital. For the past fifteen years the leading political parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition first under president Sazonov, then under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. Today Russia is becoming increasingly unstable, and other political forces are growing. They consider that it is now time for change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."

russia.1017.d:0 "In 1920 a Constituent Assembly was held, elections which, as in 1918, were won by the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. In the absence of the Bolsheviks in the elections, the Liberal Party of Kadets and the Social Democratic Party of Mensheviks, respectively, came in second and third with some margin.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly thus elected decreed that Russia was a democratic federal parliamentary republic with universal suffrage. The parliament consisted of two chambers: the State Council and the Duma. The State Council, renamed the Senate in 1925, became a bastion of reactionary conservative forces in the young republic because it was formed in a somewhat authoritarian manner.\n\nIn 1920, according to the Constitution, the Senate elected Russia's first president, Sergei Sazonov, a former prime minister in Kolchak's government. He was a compromise candidate that the conservatives and the military imposed for the sake of the predominantly leftist Duma. The real disaster was the first term of Sazonov's government and the Fifth State Duma. After the civil war, the country faced a devastated economy, peasant uprisings, and famine, caused largely by the Bolshevik "black redistribution." In the course of the "black redistribution," several of the most efficient landed estates, where landlords or wealthy merchants farmed according to advanced European methods, and the yields on such farms could exceed the yields on peasant land by 50 percent, were destroyed. Sazonov never fully resolved the land question by abolishing "black redistribution" and returning land to the landlords in the cities. The famine that engulfed the Volga and southern regions led to a reduction of the population and increased discontent. Sazonov vetoed all attempts by the Socialists to socialize land. The Japanese occupation of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk also contributed to this.\n\nIn 1922, just two years after the ratification of the Minsk Treaty, an uprising occurred in Karelia. Thanks to German mediation, the Eastern Karelian uprising was suppressed by the signing of the Treaty of Tartu, under which the townships of Repola and Porajärvi were ceded to the Kingdom of Finland, but full-scale war was averted and Eastern Karelia remained under Russian rule. Thanks to Sazonov's diplomatic efforts, Russia managed to establish good relations with most of the new states that emerged as a result of the Civil War."

russia.1018.d:0 "In the years that followed, the government managed to shake off many of the effects of the Civil War. The economic crisis was coming to an end, and industry began to develop slowly. This was largely due to its vulnerable position in the face of German domination. German business was penetrating into Russia, displacing domestic production and making Russia dependent on the empire. Flirting with the German Empire destroyed the image of the government. Russian industry developed belatedly, and the loss of western territories, rich in human and industrial resources, slowed the process even further. In addition, the democratization of the regime threatened the conservative strata of society, including the Cossacks, wealthy businessmen, and aristocrats.\n\nDissatisfaction with the Sazonov regime and anti-German sentiment grew and culminated in the last months of 1924. The failures of the Sazonov government culminated in spontaneous rallies and protest demonstrations, with the result that Sazonov was forced to resign, and in his place the SRs pushed through Alexander Kerensky, a man who the Duma believed would not interfere with democratic reforms. However, the appointment of a left-wing president did not please the conservatives and the military..."

russia.1019.t:0 "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.1"
russia.1019.d:0 "The various Cossack Hosts likewise grew increasingly wary of the government in Petrograd, fearing that a SR majority would strip them of their traditional rights and privileges on behalf of their territories' vast, non-Cossack populations.\nDespite the Putsch's eventual moniker, Alexander Kolchak was a late addition to the conspiracy, as he had been largely content to sit on his laurels in the aftermath of the Civil War. He was, however, the natural figurehead for an anti-German, anti-Kerenskyist coup, as he had already proven himself as a Russian Cincinnatus, who had made hard choices in war-time before relinquishing them in peace. Feeling assured that the Russian military would overwhelmingly side with him over Kerensky, Kolchak signed-on enthusiastically with the plotters.\n\nThe Cossacks, despite their key role in the coming uprising, had diverse and often unclear motivations. Ataman Pyotr Krasnov, despite a well-known reputation for his cooperation with the Germans during the Civil War, signed on with his Kuban counterpart, Nikolay Bukretov, out of shared concerns for the safety of Cossack privileges, as well as continuing resentment over their treatment by fellow White generals in the past. Much the same could be said of Ataman Dutov of the Orenburg Cossacks and Ataman Semyonov of the Transbaikal Cossacks, who valued their past service with Kolchak, and shared concerns over the Russian government's rapprochement with the Central Asian Turkic peoples and Buryats over the Cossacks' concerns.\n\nThe Czechoslovak Legion was the final part of the puzzle, and its concerns were driven overwhelmingly by hatred for the Central Powers, who continued to occupy their homelands, and while some Legionnaires had returned clandestinely over the years, the majority remained in exile in Russia, at the threat of facing trial as traitors back home."

russia.1020.t:0 "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.2"
russia.1020.d:0 "The date for the Putsch was set for November 14th, 1924, and it began without issues. Kolchak-aligned Russian and Czechoslovak soldiers surrounded the Winter Palace and other key locations of Petrograd, and telegraph offices were seized to announce the immediate arrest of Kerensky on charges of treasonous profiteering and corruption from deals made with the Germans. Meanwhile, the Cossack forces of Atamans Krasnov and Dutov deployed across Southern Russia and Central Asia, chiefly as a show of force to inspire confidence among the rest of the Russian military.\n\nThe response, however, shocked Kolchak and his backers. Rather than rally to his side, the overwhelming majority of Russian enlisted soldiers and even officers refused to join the putsch, and while they refused to open fire on the putschists, no help was extended from that corner. Kolchak immediately laid the blame for this on the shoulders of General Lavr Kornilov, who, despite himself having launched a coup against Kerensky in 1917, refused to help Kolchak out of lingering resentment for not being chosen as White commander-in-chief during the Civil War. More plausibly, Kornilov and the rest of Russia's military high command likely realized that antagonizing the Germans while Russia was in such a weak state would simply make the situation worse, and that Kerensky was a necessary evil to moderate the demands of the still-strong Socialist presence in the country.\n\nRegardless of their motivations, Russia's military largely stood by and watched as the Putschists tried to seize power. Though Kerensky would claim credit for it in later years, it is unlikely any of his statements from the besieged Winter Palace had made it out to the wider world before mass demonstrations paralyzed Russia's cities. Countrywide strikes were called, and those Putschists outside the major cities found themselves stranded as railroad workers sabotaged their attempts to move. The Putsch in Petrograd would last less than 48 hours, as loyalist military units and public protest convinced Kolchak's supporters to lay down their arms peacefully in exchange for amnesty."

russia.1021.t:0 "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.3"
russia.1021.d:0 "Within two weeks, the Cossacks had also all agreed to stand down, albeit with great trepidation for the future. Ataman Dutov was too well ensconced in Central Asia and too beloved by his men to be peacefully removed, and so he was left alone. Much the same could be said of Krasnov and his supporters in the south, who rallied the threat of radical Cossack independence to forestall rash action by the Russian government. Nevertheless, it was likely the German government's own guarantee of a peaceful resolution in southern Russia which saved Krasnov's and Bukretov's regime and establishing a secured border at the Don and Volga rivers, as Mitteleuropa had much to gain with the lingering threat of a Cossack quasi-states.\n\nAs for Kolchak himself, the Admiral and his closest supporters fled east to the Japanese-backed Transamur, the last bastion of "Entente" controlled Russia, wherein he would lay claim to the title of legitimate ruler of Russia. Backed by the Transbaikal Cossack and Eastern Siberian Federalists, the borders were move as far as the Baikal lake and Irkutsk.\n\nKerensky had no choice but to accept what had happened as a fact. The newly formed states were protected by the German and Japanese imperialists, and the country was not ready for a full-fledged war, not yet recovered from the horrors of civil war and with poorly developed industry. Of course, relations with Germany and Japan were damaged, but Russia was still forced to comply with the terms of the Minsk Treaty. Instead of war, Kerensky chose peace, but he also realized the weakness of his power, so it was the following years that shaped Russian reality as it is now."

russia.1022.t:0 "A Troubled History: New Rules"
russia.1022.d:0 "Kerensky's first term was marred not only by the Kolchak campaign, but also by the rise of radicalism in society and the creation of new parties and organizations that demanded radical changes. The bloc 'New Bolsheviks', created by Rykov and Bukharin, took shape as a political party - the NSP and began to promote its ideas of a gradual transition to socialism. And after the Kolchak coup and the loss of the Kuban and Eastern Siberia in the wake of anti-German sentiment, Boris Savinkov, relying on the peasant electorate, creates a huge bloc of right-wing parties - the People's Republican Party of Russia.\n\nAlready in 1925 Kerensky's reaction followed. He began his transformation and strengthening of his own power. The State Council was renamed the Senate, and the procedure for election to it was changed. It became an institution composed of 150 senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations, 50 of whom are appointed by the regional legislatures, 50 - by the president and 50 - elected by the people with sufficient age (30 years) and higher education or social status (former aristocracy) or personal wealth.\n\nBy becoming a stronghold of conservative forces, the Senate guaranteed the blocking of any radical Duma bills aimed at changing the status quo, and at the same time guaranteed the irremovability of Kerensky's power. Kerensky consolidated his power, but a sharp shift toward authoritarianism increased resistance to his rule in the Duma. The leader of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, Chernov, agreed to maintain the coalition only for the sake of stabilizing the situation, hoping for free elections and that sooner or later the Socialist-Revolutionaries would be able to implement their policies."

russia.1023.t:0 "A Troubled History: Stabilisation and Decay"
russia.1023.d:0 "After the upheavals of the Kolchak putsch and the radicalization of society, however, the situation has somewhat stabilized - both in the village and in the city. Yields increased, German technology brought mechanization and new fertilizers, and large cities began to develop industry. In 1927, the Social Revolutionaries won the elections again and re-formed a government with the Kadets, and in 1928 Kerensky was again re-elected president. The status quo persisted.\n\nThis idyll and hopes for further stability were overshadowed by several factors. The first of these was the unfinished land reform, which continued to sow unrest among the peasants. The second is economic dependence on Germany due to the Minsk Agreement and high tariffs. The third is the authoritarian bias of Kerensky, who had to make more and more concessions to the Senate.\n\nWith the hope of reducing dependence on German capital, the conservatives suggested that Kerensky should begin a policy of protectionism aimed at developing domestic production. The state reduced trade with Germany, which in the short term led to a rapid growth of industry, but soon turned into a failure due to the reduction of important supplies of German equipment. In an attempt to combat German influence, the government began inefficient and expensive imports of basic necessities from the United States.\n\nThis policy eventually led to the closure of most German businesses and increased unemployment. In 1929, the economic crisis in the United States led to the fact that short-term loans issued to Russian companies were withdrawn. This led to the collapse of the Russian economy, which was now left without most of the German enterprises and without American loans. Kerensky had no choice but to return to negotiations with Germany. At the Berlin Conference of 1930, Kerensky literally begged for the new loans from Germany, further strengthening German influence than before the policy of protectionism. All this, in general, led to a sharp increase in the popularity of Bukharin's NSP and Savinkov's NRPR."

russia.1024.t:0 "A Troubled History: Radicalization"
russia.1024.d:0 "Bukharin's People's Socialist Party was in a semi-legal position. On the one hand, fearing any manifestations of socialist discontent, Kerensky did not prohibit the activities of the 'New Bolsheviks'. On the other hand, the high threshold for passing to the Duma prevented the presence of any noticeable number of deputies from the NSP.\nThe popularity of the NPRP was very high. They had no flaw in their connection with the Bolsheviks, like Bukharin, and Savinkov was a respected figure during the Civil War.\n\nThe 1932 elections marked the beginning of the end of Kerensky's rule. Savinkov's party was able to overtake the Socialist-Revolutionaries in terms of the number of votes, and only a coalition of Kadets and Socialists-Revolutionaries, once again lobbied by Kerensky, was able to save the situation.\n\nRealizing the power of his influence, Savinkov began to actively promote his own ideas. Being a revolutionary and a supporter of terrorism, he creates the paramilitary wing of the party - the Combat Squads of the NPRP, aimed at a radical solution to the 'Kerensky problem'.\n\nOf course, this could not please the other parties in the Duma, who now saw Savinkov's party as a direct threat to democracy, nor Kerensky and the Senate, who saw Savinkov's party as a direct threat to their power.\n\nThe last years of the republic from 1932 to the present were largely devoted to the fight against radicalism within society: mass events were banned, and Kerensky strengthened anti-terrorist measures. The actual declaration of war was the violent dispersal of an anti-government demonstration of the people's Republicans by the police on the anniversary of the February Revolution in 1934. Attempts on senators and ministers became more frequent, and Kerensky began to think seriously about dissolving the Duma and banning Savinkov's party. However, to do this, he needed the help of the army - and with the commander-in-chief, Lavr Kornilov, he had strained relations, not to mention the more conservative officers who were still convinced monarchists. In 1935, workers ' strikes and clashes between socialists and People's Republicans became more frequent. In November 1935, Kerensky survived an armed attack, and who knows - maybe it will happen again."

russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1920, after the end of the Russian Civil War and three years after the February Revolution, the Constitution of the Russian Republic is a scar of the fractured White movement which saw its adoption. According to the Constitution, Russia, the Russian Democratic Federative Republic, is a democratic parliamentary federation of both national and territorial autonomous oblasts.\nThe legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate.\n\nIn some ways, the Constitution is an updated version of the Tsarist constitution of 1906 - the upper house of the Parliament, the Senate, is the main example of this authoritarian heritage. It is an institution composed of 150 senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations, 50 of whom are appointed by the regional legislatures, 50 - by the president and 50 - elected by the people with sufficient age (30 years) and higher education or social status (former aristocracy) or personal wealth. The lower house, the State Duma, is elected and holds most of the legislative power in the country. The presence of the unelected Senate curbs democratic process in the country, however.\n\nThe executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every four years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers. The Prime-Minister is the head of government, chosen by the Parliament and appointed by President. The Speaker of the Senate is chosen by the Senate and becomes acting president should the President become unable to serve. The new President is elected only after the term of the elected President comes to end.\n\nThe President is the primary actor in executing legislative acts and represents the Republic in foreign affairs. He also has access to the infamous Article 48 of the Constitution, which allows the President to take emergency actions without the approval of the Duma. President Alexander Kerensky has grown fond of using this power to bypass the increasingly fractured legislature and thus pass decrees and laws.\n\nDrafted under the guidance of the White Generals, the Constitution can only call itself a protector of democracy when its articles are not used against it."

russia.2017.t:0 "The Russian Economy"
russia.2017.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War in early 1920's, the Sazonov's government attempted to recover the economy using a mix of socialist economic theories and the propositions of the Kadets and its supporters among the Russian capitalists. Sazonov recognised the de-facto redistribution of the land among the Russian peasants and restored private land ownership. Using the gold reserve of the Russian Empire, which during the Civil War was under Kolchak's control and later was transferred to Petrograd, Sazonov introduced a new currency and launched new economic policies which allowed him to recover the Tsarist industry, including military plants, and involving American investments in the various branches of the Russian economy. However, the reforms were not enough to fully industrialize the country and the slowing growth of the economy as well as the intensification of the confrontation between the right and left parts of the Russian establishment led to the recession in 1933. It is clear that the Russian industry still has great potential, which can strengthen the economy as well as the international position of the country."

russia.3.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.3.d:0 "During the Berlin Conference in November 1935, the Germans forced us to repay the remaining part of the Weltkrieg war indemnities (agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk treaty in 1918) one year earlier than expected, which has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than to impose harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support. Our citizens were already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets and Socialist Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Alexander Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."
russia.3.a:0 "We must increase austerity measures."

russia.4.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.4.d:0 "With the stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions for our citizens during 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash. The only available option to amass sufficient capital to help our economy, was to force the Russian state to prematurely repay the remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Berlin conference in November 1935 president Alexandr Kerensky, together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov, were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastic austerity measures the Russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."

russia.5.d:0 "The sound of gunfire rings across the capital. Alexander Kerensky, the President of the Russian Republic was shot by an extremist while he was climbing the steps to the Senate House. The killer was beaten by an angry mob before he could make his escape. The police arrived soon and the assassin was recognized as Pavel Gorgulov, member of Savinkov's Combat Squads. Regardless, the fate of Russia has been irrevocably changed, for better or worse."

russia.6.d:0 "The assassination of our long term president, Alexander Kerensky, has thrown the country into chaos. According to the Constitution, the Speaker of the Senate, Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov becomes an acting president. However, with the president gone the governing coalition of Kadets and Social Revolutionaries has collapsed. Snap elections should be held, otherwise the military will try to overtake the country by force."

russia.7.d:0 "The life of the President of the Republic was hanging by a thread. In the Admiralty Hospital of Emperor Peter the Great in St. Petersburg, a team of doctors tried to save his life all night. They succeeded. But unfortunately, the president was in a coma. And until he woke up, the government of the country was in the hands of other people. The newspapers were silent all day, the president's condition was not reported. Only high-ranking officials knew about him, who were not ready to declare the president's condition for the time being. In the end, it was not known if he would be able to survive.\n\nFrosty January morning in Petrograd. \n\nRussia may change forever."
russia.7.a:0 "Russia will never be the same."

russia.8.t:0 "Panic in Petrograd!"
russia.8.d:0 "In the blink of an eye, the country was in the deepest political crisis. Another attempt to assassinate the president, the payment of new compensations to Germany, as well as the mysterious disappearance of the murderer from the crime scene made people really worry about the state of affairs. In addition, President Kerensky was still in a coma and there were no statements from officials. Newspapers popular among the townspeople described the attack on Kerensky in colors - some wrote that they had caught the president in the act, and he was wounded, bleeding, lying surrounded by guards and the crowd, waiting for medical help. \n\nOther newspapers popular among the opposition described the attack on Kerensky as an attempt by a madman to end the life of a traitor who sold the country to Germany for loans and investments. The assassin's bullet was described almost as an arrow of liberation from the oppression of the oligarchs given by the Lord himself. And the hand of Gorgulov, unwavering before an attempt to take a person's life, symbolized the punitive hand of popular justice - a deserved lynching of a tyrant. \n\nMeanwhile, the lack of news forced citizens, mainly workers of the Putilov plant, to declare a strike of thousands and take to the streets of the city demanding freedom from the tyranny of capital, saving the country from poverty. On the other hand, a crowd of Savinkov's supporters, radically opposed to socialism, with slogans about true people's freedom under the leadership of a hero Vozhd, was coming towards them."

Early in the morning Green Armymen entered Savinkov's residence in [RUS.Capital.GetName] and shot him and his security dead. At the same time, Savinkov's loyal officials were arrested and imprisoned without trial. After the death of Savinkov, most of the Combat Squads have recognized the leadership of Gorgulov's Green Army. Later in the afternoon, Pavel Gorgulov announced that Boris Savinkov died a sudden death and his last will was to transfer power to Gorgulov. The Green Vozhd, as Gorgulov has proclaimed himself, has recommended everyone to respect Savinkov's last will."

russia.16.d:0 "During the Civil War, the Bolshevik Party split into two parts. Orthodox Leninists, known by their original name of the RCP, are now banned across the country, and their ban is uncontroversial.\n\nThe activities of other radical left-wing parties, namely the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and Bukharin's NSP, were allowed, but they were not allowed to participate in the elections. Since Kerensky himself was partly a socialist, he rather concentrated more on the struggle with the right-wing parties, namely with his former ally Savinkov, as a result of which the Left SRs and Bukharinists calmly conducted their agitation activities. Now we have to decide whether to lift the ban on these parties' participation in the elections or not. On the one hand, the right-wing parties oppose the admission of the left to the elections, fearing the return of Bolshevism. But on the other hand, maybe they're just afraid of losing."

russia.21.t:0 "Dealing With Black Monday"
russia.21.d:0 "At the moment, in the context of the political crisis, it is impossible to take any well-thought-out measures to de-escalate the economic crisis. However, there are two plans for emergency anti-crisis measures: the plan proposed by the Senate and the President, and supported by the right-wing Cadets, conservatives and Eurasians, and the plan proposed by the majority of the Duma - the Social Revolutionaries and Savinkovites.\n\nThe nominally called \"Senate Plan\" and \"Duma Plan\" are trying to solve the Black Monday problem in different ways. The Senate's plan calls for a protectionist approach that tries to keep the state from interfering in the economy and at the same time save it from falling into the abyss by attracting private domestic investment. The Duma's plan is more radical: it involves immediate state intervention in the economy with the nationalization of key industries, and German enterprises, as well as subsidizing agriculture.\n\nNow there is no time for rant and debate, and any plan will be adopted by all houses of parliament and signed by the president, despite the differences of politicians."

russia.22.d:0 "Now that the situation in Russia has begun to stabilise, the Russian people have begun to turn westward. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk has been paraded as an example of a punitive treaty since its inception, but only now has Russia gotten confident enough to consider repudiating it. Printing presses are publishing maps and treatises where Russia's western neighbours are declared 'German-occupied Western Territories' and the locals living there are described as suffering, awaiting the return of Mother Russia. This is one issue which can unite the Russian right, left and centre, though for different reasons. Russian nationalists obviously seek revenge against Germany, whereas the leftists see Germany as the hegemon which prevents the rise of socialism and Syndicalism in Europe.\n\nNo matter what regime may be in charge, they will need to place the reconquest of Russia's western territories at the top of the priority list. Few want to see Russia start this war, however. The general line of thought among the Russian populace, intellectuals and politicians is that Russia needs to wait. Observe. And descend like a hawk when Germany is focused elsewhere. Cunning has saved Russia in countless wars before, and this moment will be no different."

russia.23.d:0 "Russia may hold ambitions of retaking the West, but even the most radical Russian nationalists can tell that she will not be able to challenge Germany in this state. Her military industry has been neglected and her economy is not yet ready to out-produce the West. Though Russia holds massive potential, many sacrifices will have to be made before we will be able to repudiate the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Which is why these sacrifices have been proposed. The government has been introduced a bill for national rearmanent, including austerity policies and the expansion of state owned arms production enterprises, even if they will come at a cost."

To go through with his plans for the army would be an easy affair. He suggests that Russia should rely on our huge numbers to win any future wars, but also insists that a motorisation of our forces is necessary. Wrangel, while not as widely respected as Denikin, is still popular with some parts of the military. He believes in discipline and is respected far and wide for his administrative abilities. With extensive planning and a general motorisation, he believes he can make the Russian army the greatest in the world! Shatilov is a veteran from both the front lines and the staff quarters. While not the first choice of the Military command he does have a circle of close allies who all advocate theories of overwhelming firepower, hammering enemy positions with artillery before attacking. Additionally, more initiative and responsibility needs to be given to the officer at the front-line. And finally, no one doubts the talents of Markov, put to display in every war since the Russo-Japanese one. During the Weltkrieg he was a close assistant to Denikin.

Despite all the efforts of the police to catch the criminal, he managed to cover his tracks. The official position of the leader of the NRPR, Boris Savinkov, is that the criminal was expelled from the party and that he acted alone, without coordinating his actions with the leadership in any way. While the police are on the prowl, Kerensky is still in a coma, and it is unknown how this may end."
russia.103.a:0 "Where is he hiding?"

russia.104.d:0 "Joyful news has been received today in all the newspapers of the country - President Kerensky has come out of a coma, feels well and is aware of everything around him. He will be ready to return to work in the coming days. \n\nHowever, a terrible political and economic crisis has flared up in the country over the past month, and the idea of returning the old politician to his former place has not found a wide response in the eyes of people. Presidential elections are coming in June 1936, and it is obvious that Kerensky will be appointed president again. If he cannot deal with the situation in the country, the situation will worsen."

This body includes people close to the president who should come up with a plan in the near future and begin active actions to improve the situation in the country. Of course, the president will have the final word.\n\nMany have already opposed the creation of the Committee, calling it an unconstitutional and illegal entity that alienates real power from the legitimately elected parliament. However, so far, these are only the objections of people whose opinion does not solve anything."

russia.106.t:0 "Choosing Our Focus"
russia.106.d:0 "With the Committee finally established, we must choose our main aim for the 6 month. While many of Kerensky's advisors now suggest to focus on fighting terrorists, bringing back stability and peace to the republic, the others suggest that we should deal with the Economy problems first. The healthier our economy is - the more stable is the society. However, there is also a third faction, that suggests that we should modernize our army."

russia.107.d:0 "Today, the President of the Republic will hold meetings together with the leaders of the PSR, RSDRP and KDP parties, as well as Prime Minister Pavel Milyukov. \n\nFor the consideration of the audience, the President presented a proposal to create a united anti-radical coalition to solve the political and economic crisis in the country. Despite the fact that the KDP and the Cadets have long been in a single coalition, the addition of Mensheviks to them can significantly shift the ideology of the coalition to the left, which will lead to a more socialist composition of the next coalition. It is precisely these kinds of issues that the assembly should decide."
russia.107.a:0 "Let's talk!"

russia.108.t:0 "Nominating the New Prime-Minister"
russia.108.d:0 "The first and key issue that the audience should solve is the new Prime Minister of the country. At the moment, his position is occupied by Pavel Milyukov, for 20 years. On the part of the Cadets, this candidacy suits them, since Milyukov is a bright politician and ready to compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, President Kerensky has put forward a new candidate - the centrist SR Zenzinov, who is even more ideologically flexible, and is ready to yield even to the most liberal proposals of the Cadets and the most socialist proposals of the SRs. \n\nHowever, on the other hand, the Mensheviks advocated the most optimal option, in their opinion - Irakli Tsereteli, the main contender for the post of Prime Minister of the RSDRP. \n\nAny of the candidates, apparently, can suit everyone if they make concessions to the parties on other issues."
russia.108.a:0 "Zenzinov is a perfect candidate."
russia.108.b:0 "Tsereteli is a more balanced choice."
russia.108.c:0 "Milyukov is still the most prefered choice."

russia.109.t:0 "Question of Land"
russia.109.d:0 "It is not surprising that due to the unfinished land reform, this issue arose almost immediately. \n\nThe Social Revolutionaries did not hesitate for a minute to call for the immediate socialization of the land, simultaneously reminding Kerensky of his membership in the party and his long-standing promises to close the land issue. \n\nHowever, the socialization of the earth in modern realities is considered by the Cadets as a betrayal of the interests of other social strata, and they once again announced the rejection of the SR proposal. In return, they propose the creation of a National Agrarian Fund, which will subsidize private land farms of peasants, and encourage cooperatives.\n\nThe Mensheviks, in turn, have their own program of land reform: the so-called Agricultural Secure Council and Municipalization. According to their program, instead of socialization, the land shall be given to local municipal councils, with a Federal agency created in order to secure the municipal holdings."

It seems that with the creation of a new coalition, Kerensky's unspoken alliance with Dmitry Romanov, the speaker of the Senate, has come to an end."

russia.112.t:0 "Expanding the powers of the Senate"
russia.112.d:0 "The Duma is nothing but a strange mix of people with radically different views that argue how should our president govern the country. Kerensky was one of the first to understand that parliamentarism is an alien value, imposed by failed Canadian and French governments. Their parliamentarism led to socialist revolutions. With the dissolution of Duma as an useless holdover from the old days, we should empower the Senate - assembly of nobles, aristocrats, academicians and the most prominent Russian citizens."
russia.112.a:0 "The Senate should be the only legislative body."

russia.113.t:0 "The End of the Russian Democracy"
russia.113.d:0 "All the power has been finally consolidated in the hands of one man - the only deserving candidate - President Kerensky. With the Duma dissolved, martial law invoked and state of emergency declared, nothing can stop Kerensky from achieving the ultimate goal - becoming the eternal president. Every sensible citizen understands - that both socialists and nationalist will ruin the country or drag it into war; and parliamentarism will lead to constant debates about simple solutions. While almost handling the power of an absolute Tsar, Kerensky will wisely govern, continuing to keep order in a falling apart Empire."

We shall empower our president so he won't become a puppet of the Senate and can easily defend himself. While currently 3/5 of the Senate should vote for the candidate in order to appoint him as a president, this proportion should be changed to 4/5.

russia.134.d:0 "During a meeting of the Left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov's Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Social Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov dyarchy."

russia.135.d:0 "'The whole question of Russia's existence depends on our understanding the true nature of Bolshevism and the nature of its supporters. We have to open our eyes to the fact that Bolshevism is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. That's exactly the reason why we should identify all its supporters and limit their influence to the life of the Russian Republic.' - with these words the main ideologist of the Russian "National Renewal" Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy explained the revocation of the right to vote as well as the part of the other civil rights for the members of the Bolshevik party and some former Soviet officials. With this measure, Boris Savinkov and NRPR are going to improve the situation in the Russian society and get rid of all these elements, who undermine the stability of Russia.\n\nThe October putsch, called a Revolution by some, left Russia changed forever. This means that it is very easy to blame Russia's faults and weaknesses not on inaction, not on the failures of the current government, but on the Bolsheviks who supposedly ruined it all - and the NRPR is sure to take advantage of this myth. History textbooks are being amended, a mass propaganda campaign started, and the message sent that the Bolshevik uprising was not just an ordinary uprising. An international conspiracy, one which sought to destroy holy Russia and make sure it never rises again, was responsible for funding the Bolshevik Party and supplying their uprising across central Russia, and were it not stopped by force of arms, it would have left Russia broken, destroyed and shattered. These textbooks make sure to note the fact that Vladimir Lenin had been sent to Petrograd by the Germans, and that many of the leading members of the Bolshevik Party were not Russian - Caucasians, Balts, Poles, and especially Jews."

It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the 'vox populi' about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."

I believe that this struggle will be continued and our Vozhd will revenge for all these young heroes, who were cowardly killed by the lefts. This struggle must finish with our victory.' - Ivan Shmelyov, Russian conservative writer, whose unarmed son was killed by the Reds at the end of the civil war, demands that Russian government should continue to fight against the left movements, such as Left SRs and Mensheviks not only in Moscow and Petrograd, but also in the various Russian regions. Though these parties were incredibly weakened by special government measures after Savinkov's rise to power and the killing of Maria Spiridonova and Boris Kamkov, their leaders in Russian regions definitely should be arrested and even executed, if necessary."

This is where one of the rising stars in the National Republican Party and the Deputy Minister of Interior, Viktor Abakumov, stepped in to offer a solution. To ensure that the Vozhd's rule is forever solid and his regime lasts a thousand years, the Russian nation must learn to fear, and above all else, its enemies must learn to fear.\n\nAbakunov's brainchild is a purge not from the top down, done via orders to arrest this dissident or that dissident, but instead from the bottom up. All regional governors need to be given quotas of "enemies of the state" they need to find, extract, and purge. Those who do not deserve a bullet to the back of the head should work off their debt instead - the Tsarist Okhrana laid the groundwork for deporting thousands of dissidents to Siberia, but this system can be modernized, industrialized, and turned into an archipelago of destruction. Even those who are not plotting against Russia must know their place - Abakunov offers to incentivize ratting out possible enemies of the state in workplaces, schools or even families, creating an atmosphere of worry and uncertainty under which the masses will flock to the only thing which can keep them safe, loyalty to the Vozhd.\n\nEven fellow members of the NRPR believe that Abakumov's proposal is...crazy, but Savinkov has taken personal interest in the proposal."

russia.139.d:0 "After the end of the Russian Civil War, some of the national minorities which fought on the side of the Soviets against the White Army continued to disobey the central government, not only through acts of terrorism, but also using the opportunity to take part in the local legislative authorities, where they often found support among the left movements, such as the Mensheviks and parts of the Left SRs. This movement of local nationalists became famous as the 'Left Separatists'. Though Boris Savinkov has accepted the new national policy, which should regulate and improve the relations between Russians and the Russian minorities, including groups disloyal to Petrograd, he cannot forget about the problem of the Left Separatists, which still exist even after the proscription of the Russian Left SR party and its allies. Thanks to our Ministry of Security, the leaders, active members and terrorists from the most notorious Left Separatist movements have been arrested and their property has been nationalised."

russia.141.d:0 "After illegal laws, passed by Kerensky, the citizens have rebelled against the oppresive rule of a paranoid President, who has once betrayed the country. His attempt to stop the protesters failed. Soon after the police and parts of army have joined the protest against current President. Later that day, Kerensky was arrested in his office for attempt to seize power in the country. But the future of the country is still unsolved."
russia.141.a:0 "Kornilov storms Moscow and seizes power."
russia.141.b:0 "Provisional Civilian Government established."

russia.142.d:0 "After illegal laws, passed by Kerensky, the citizens have rebelled against the oppresive rule of a paranoid President, who has once betrayed the country. His attempt to stop the protesters succeeded. The army and the police have successfully dispersed the crowd and Kerensky's rule was secured."
russia.142.a:0 "Kerensky secures the rule"

russia.143.d:0 "Kerensky was unable to secure his weak power across in Russia. Today several high military commanders, under the leadership of Lavr Kornilov, with the help of Russian Army have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities."

russia.145.t:0 "Kerenskiy Re-Elected President"
russia.145.d:0 "The presidential term came to an end, and according to the agreements of President Kerensky with the Senate, he was re-elected for a new term.\n\nKerensky's last term from 1932 to the present has been largely devoted to the fight against radicalism within society: mass events were banned, and Kerensky strengthened anti-terrorist measures. Attempts on senators and ministers, workers' strikes and clashes between socialists and popular Republicans have become more frequent. In November 1935, Kerensky survived an armed attack, and then another one in January 1936. Since that moment, life in the country has changed.\n\nDuring the inauguration for a new term, Kerensky announced that the next 4 years would be different for the country. Terror and instability will be destroyed, the modernization of the army will be carried out, the policy of isolation in foreign policy will end due to the end of reparations payments under the Minsk Agreement, and the country will also come out of the terrible crisis of Black Monday. Kerensky promised that industrialization and the final solution of the land issue were waiting for the country."
russia.145.a:0 "4 More Years!"

russia.146.t:0 "Kerensky Ousted From Presidency"
russia.146.d:0 "The formation of a new parliamentary coalition with the participation of the Mensheviks, the conservative Senators, whom Kerensky himself appointed as guarantors of his irremovability, perceived as a violation of the agreements!\n\nBy a majority vote, the Senate voted against Kerensky's candidacy in favor of the current speaker of the Senate, Dmitry Romanov, a well-known lobbyist for the interests of the new Russian aristocracy and oligarchy. Kerensky was removed from his post, which means the beginning of a new era in Russia. As it became known from the evening newspapers, on the same day Kerensky left the country, leaving for Berlin, fearing arrest and imprisonment for anything that could be imputed to him. \n\nHowever, a new problem is brewing in the country, laid down by an imperfect constitution - elections to the Duma will take place only in a year, and it is unlikely that the newly elected president will be able to counteract it without abusing his veto right and dissolving the Duma."
russia.146.a:0 "The end of Eternal President!"

russia.147.t:0 "Dissolution of Duma"
russia.147.d:0 "With the new president taking the reins of power, the Senate-Duma Conflict was never so clear and evident. In this case, to deal with the political crisis, Dmitriy Romanov has enacted temporary state of emergency. Now, the choice to be made, is difficult and can define the future decades. Either President will call for early elections, or appoint a presidential government, willing to cooperate with him until the state of emergency will end, which is, as promised by the President, is until the next elections."
russia.147.a:0 "Russia needs a strong government!"
russia.147.b:0 "Call for early elections!"

russia.148.t:0 "Meeting the Senators"
russia.148.d:0 "During the meeting with Senators, Kerensky, in order to insure his victory in the presidential nomination in June, had to make a number of concessions to conservative senators, among whom, mainly, the new Russian aristocracy and wealthy entrepreneurs.  \n\nThe concessions proposed by the senators were lobbying for the interests of big business, subsidies for the development of industry by large enterprises, in particular, the Putilov Plant. The senators also demanded tax concessions.\n\nIn addition, in view of the last year of reparations payments to Germany, the senators demanded distancing from German capital and imposing additional taxes on German companies - a decision that Kerensky will have to make soon at a diplomatic conference in Berlin."
russia.148.a:0 "We have no choice for now."

russia.149.t:0 "Meeting the General Staff"
russia.149.d:0 "In the course of long reflections, Kerensky came to the conclusion that good relations with the General Staff oblige him to sit down at the negotiating table with Denikin and discuss the state of the army and ways to solve current problems.\n\nThe head of the armed forces since 1921 is General Lavr Kornilov, Kerensky's sworn enemy, but appointed to this position as a commitment of the Democrats to the White Armies. His hostility towards Kerensky for many years prevented an adequate dialogue between the authorities and the general Staff. Despite the fact that Denikin, nicknamed the peasant marshal, is the head of the general staff, he is also a member of the ROVS and is one of Kornilov's close associates.\n\nDuring the discussion with the generals, they made a proposal to immediately lobby for an increase in the country's military budget and the modernization of both the doctrine and equipment of the Russian troops. However, on the part of the army, in turn, Kerensky demanded not to hinder him in exercising his legitimate presidential power, and also announced his intention to declare a state of emergency in the country in connection with radicalism and terrorism, and use this provision to dissolve the Duma and strengthen his own power."
russia.149.a:0 "Something we should do now!"

russia.150.t:0 "Confronting Kornilov"
russia.150.d:0 "Since the Kornilov rebellion in 1917, Kerensky and Kornilov's relations have been not just strained, but hostile. However, when Kerensky gained a foothold in power, Kornilov was already commander-in-chief. Moreover, he did not support Kolchak's coup and remained loyal to the Republican system. His resignation in those years would have meant a betrayal of the victory of the White Armies. However, now everything has changed. Due to the agreements with the General Staff, Kerensky received guarantees from many generals, and the retirement of the elderly Kornilov was seen as something necessary. In addition, there were grounds to believe that Kornilov was connected with Savinkov and his party - Kerensky's main opponents in the political field. \n\nAccording to the Constitution, it is the President who appoints the head of the Russian Army, and, using his legal right, nothing prevents Kerensky from dismissing Kornilov and appointing Denikin's close associate, General Romanovsky, as commander-in-chief."
russia.150.a:0 "Leave him as the head of the army for the sake of stability"
russia.150.b:0 "Appoint Romanovskiy the new Chief of Army!"

russia.152.t:0 "President Kerensky Shot!"
russia.152.d:0 "The sound of gunfire rings across the capital. Alexander Kerensky, the President of the Russian Republic was shot by an extremist while he was climbing the steps to the Senate House. The killer was shot by the police, however, his personality is hidden for now. Regardless, the fate of Russia has been irrevocably changed, for better or worse."
russia.152.a:0 "A shot that will ring across the world."

russia.153.t:0 "Rumors of Kerensky's Resignation?"
russia.153.d:0 "Recently, rumors began to circulate among Moscow saloons that the \"Eternal President\" Kerensky intended to resign and make way for his successor...\n\nMany suspect, however, that Kerensky is already so attached to the presidency that he has no intention of resigning of his own volition.\n\nHowever, as rumors began to spread rapidly through the major cities, Kerensky was approached directly by journalists to find out what he thought about the matter.\n\nAfter thinking for a while, and even with a barely perceptible sigh, Kerensky nevertheless declared loudly and resolutely:"
russia.153.a:0 "I am tired. I am leaving."
russia.153.b:0 "Another 4 years, ladies and gentlemen!"

russia.154.t:0 "Kerensky's Successor"
russia.154.d:0 "A few days after announcing his imminent resignation, Kerensky made a new appeal. He announced that the Senate had decided to terminate his powers early and that his successor until the next election would be Pitirim Sorokin, the famous Russian sociologist.\n\nHe became famous soon after the February Revolution, becoming editor of the central newspaper of the Social Revolutionaries, Volya Naroda, along with Breshko-Breshkovskaya, the \"Grandmother of the Russian Revolution\". He later became Kerensky's personal secretary and was elected to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Pitirim Sorokin became one of the senators from the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, which he was until the current moment. Though few had heard of him as a politician, Kerensky was convinced that it was the intelligent and bright minds who had the future, and only Sorokin would be able to accomplish what Kerensky had not fully succeeded."
russia.154.a:0 "An interesting choice..."


russia.200.t:0 "Attempt on the President’s life"
russia.200.d:0 "Today, during a military parade a crazed assassin tried to strike at President [RUS.GetLeader], this assassin was a man by the name of Sergey Taboritsky; who was killed before he could flee the scene. \n\n The assassination attempt was foiled in part due to the high security at the event, which came about as a result of previous assassinations of Russian Presidents. [RUS.GetLeader] survived the attack and the deranged assassin attempted to flee the scene on foot. However, before he could escape, he was killed by an 18th century ceremonial cannon, which was being used as a display piece before a vigilant guard used it to gun down the man who tried to kill the President.\n\n The cannon was fired into Taboritsky’s chest at point blank range, killing him instantly and reducing his body into a cloud of pulp and entrails. [RUS.GetLeader], while shocked at the attempt on his life continued attending the parade and even gave a speech at the end."

However, with the White forces eventually defeating the Bolsheviks, the private property was reestablished on all Russian territory. Kerensky, while technically being a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, understood the importance of the land question. In order to please the peasants and socialist supporters and voters, he passed the Land Socialization Bill, which originally should have abolished any private property considering land ownership. However, in order to appease the other side of the political spectrum, the liberals and conservatives, the Bill was adopted with some adjustments: while land in the most fertile lands was in a public ownership of special agricultural councils, private property over land was still legal in other areas of Russia. This, however, still led to various problems, including rising support for more radical parties in the country, rough going industrialization and difficulties with building new infrastructure.

During the Civil War, Pavel Gorgulov was engaged in subversive anti-bolshevik actions and got acquinted with Boris Savinkov. Gorgulov's views were influenced by Russian avant-garde poetic movements, such as New Peasant Poets, Imaginists and late Symbolists. Though his view became highly esoteric and even his subordinates aren't sure whether he is...sane. His emphasis on the peasantry culminates in his messianic belief that "wild, primitive, and Scythian" Russian civilization will prevail over Western civilization and establish a new order across the world.\n\nAfter Savinkov's takeover of Russia, Pavel Gorgulov was pardoned and subsequently released from jail. However, with the help of the Green Army, Pavel Gorgulov managed to overthrow Savinkov and install his own dictatorship.

Throughout his colorful life, he has assassinated and bombed many as a part of the Combat Organization of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, before moving on to becoming a pragmatic schemer behind Alexander Kerensky's back - as Assistant War Minister in 1917, he nearly assumed dictatorial power in Russia from the shadows, and only the collapse of the Kornilov coup led to his downfall. However, he rehabilitated himself by organizing the Union for the Defense of the Motherland, an underground resistance organization in Moscow which prepared the soil for the city's fall in 1919.\n\nSavinkov may have once been a socialist, but he has long since abandoned the weak Socialist Revolutionaries in favor of a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced him over the years - all of which merge into a system of totalitarian dictatorial rule, agrarian Socialist-Revolutionary policy, Orthodox Christianity and a concept of palingenetic rebirth: like an eagle rising from the ashes, the Vozhd shall restore the glory of the Russian state and transform it into a hegemon of reaction." 
POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_TSAR_DESC:0 "Among Russian generals of Baltic German birth, of which there are many, Pyotr IV Wrangel is perhaps the most famous. A talented cavalry officer from a family which gifted several commanders to the Imperial Russian Army, Wrangel distinguished himself during the Brusilov Offensive, where he showed himself as an aggressive yet trustworthy commander. For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Wrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist. And no matter what he might do, his officers will follow him regardless - to this day, junior officers in the Army ask themselves "If Tsar Pyotr was here, what would he do?""
POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Born to a Russian father and Polish mother, Anton Denikin chose to embrace the patriotism of the former, and tied the rest of his life with the Imperial Russian Army. By the Great War, he was a major general and a chief of staff in Kiev Military District, and a prolific writer who analysed the shortcomings of the Russian army. A second in command to Lavr Kornilov, he escaped to Southern Russia alongside him and helped form the Volunteer Army which would ultimately put an end to the Bolshevik revolution. It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment. Politics are the last thing on his mind, but should he end up in power one way or another, Denikin's experience in the Russian chief of staff will lead to him commanding the nation like he used to command his regiment."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexandr Fyodorovich Kerensky, born 1881 is the second President of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic so far. To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Alexander Kerensky, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerensky sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks.\n\nKerensky returned to power in 1924, as the appointed President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerensky marks his twelfth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerensky established land reform, though never fully finishing it, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the new economic program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerensky has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition.\nIn case of trouble, unknown forces could attempt to remove Kerensky from power and seize control of Russia."

As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."
POLITICS_VIKTOR_CHERNOV_DESC:0 "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasiliy Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1924, Chernov and Kerensky formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last twelve years. While Kerensky was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."
POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerensky's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Alexander Kerensky. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."

He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Eurasianist Party", a conservative party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pyotr Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defense of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticized Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigoriy Semyenov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1921 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."

Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalized her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead. \n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Eurasianist Party.

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect. \n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armored train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armored vehicles and maneouvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."

Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerensky's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."

Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labor for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticized their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern. \n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Alexandera Kollontay, he founded the Trade Unions Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

Briefly, he worked for the German SPD, before getting expelled as well. He worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did not stay in Russia either, however - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser. \n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life, however - instead of executing him like what the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans and was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system".

During this period, he organized the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."

During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Alexander Shlyapnikov. \n\nKollontay was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."

There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Alexander Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik. \n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organized the right faction of Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party. Wary of possible bureaucratization and "military-feudal exploitation" of the peasantry, Bukharin endorses a moderate approach of cautious industrialization and an alliance between the proletariat and peasantry, as well some elements of market economy."

Though educated as a cavalry officer, he graduated with a report how the cavalry is growing obsolete in the face of motorized forces. He served dutifully in the Weltkrieg and participated in the Brusilov Offensive, but his attitude changed when the February Revolution broke out. An avowed monarchist, Kappel remained silent at first, hoping for a restoration of the Romanov order once the situation stabilizes, but soon began to plot with other future White generals. When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade.

He graduated at the top of his class from the prestigious Pavlovsk Military School and fought in the Russo-Japanese War as an officer in the Life Guards Regiment, where he remained on the front lines despite injury and received several decorations for heroism. In the years that followed, he tried several prospective careers, including submarines and aircraft, but ultimately decided to stick to ground forces. His real career began after the February Revolution, when he was the first to denounce the authority of the republican government in Moscow and disobeyed orders. Stationed in Romania, he watched the Bolshevik takeover from afar and formed a military unit of his own, the Drozdovites, which marched off to join Mikhail Alekseyev's Volunteer Army in the Don.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he gained the reputation of a talented and strict, if reckless commander, who always made sure to assert that he was fighting for the holy House of Romanov. Though the dynasty was not restored, Drozdovskiy continues to harbor hopes that the throne will be assumed by a righteous monarch of noble blood one day, and until that day comes, he has crafted a complex plan for the reform of the Russian army to bring it to modern standards."

Loyal to Lavr Kornilov, he joined the Volunteer Army in the Don and became a commanding officer in the high command. This is where he gained the nickname of the "Bad Luck General". Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovskiy stood by the Republic. His undiplomatic character means that he's been delayed in promotions, but his talent in warfare cannot be mistaken - he is a capable artillery commander and an expert in firepower concentration."

The tight-lipped, mild-mannered, apolitical general has kept his former sympathies towards the Bolshevik Revolution under wraps - not long after Lenin's death at the hands of Fanny Kaplan, he defected from the Red Army, returning to demobilization once again and rejoining the Russian army in 1923. Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare. \n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilization never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilization and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war. In the Russian general staff, he stands as a supporter of army reform according to his military theory."

Staunchly apolitical, he helped maintain order in Kuban when it appeared that it might break between supporters of a union with Ukraine and a union with Russia. After the Civil War, he returned to the Kuban Host, hoping to serve among his countrymen and keep them loyal to the new regime in Moscow. A few years later, however, Pyotr Krasnov raised the banner of rebellion and Naumenko was one of the few notable Cossack leaders who openly resisted him. In battles across the steppes, however, Naumenko was eventually routed and the remnants of his unit escaped to Tsaritsyn. He has since remained in the Russian army, but continues to hold a grudge towards Krasnov for conquering his homeland, the Kuban Host, and awaits the chance to take revenge."

Like many of his peers, Shatilov followed General Kornilov to the Don region and became a member of the Volunteer Army, where he, most notably, became Pyotr Wrangel's close aide. Their friendship survived the war, and even today, Shatilov is always there when Wrangel needs support.\n\nShatilov himself is considered a capable, if particularly cold commander, distinguished by extreme self-control and a permanent frown on his face.

Only when he was drafted to the Russian Army did his superiors begin to take note of his bravery in battle and sent him to accelerated training courses. Stationed in Romania, he was present for the formation of the Drozdovite Regiment and followed Drozdovsky to the Don, where he rose through the ranks of the White Army. In the restored Russian Republic, Turkul was no longer ignored and eventually gained the rank of General.\n\nOne of the youngest generals in the Russian general staff and yet highly talented, Turkul is considered by many to be the vanguard of a new generation of Russian officers.

Even at a young age, he did not lack ambition - once the Weltkrieg began, he proudly declared that he will either be a general at thirty or dead by then. After showing skill and bravery in the Eastern Front, Tukhachevskiy fulfilled this goal - but not in the way he anticipated. He joined the Red Army as a volunteer and rapidly rose in rank, becoming a close associate to Leon Trotsky and achieving the rank of General not long after Lenin's assassination. The Fifth Army he commanded was one of the Red Army's finest units and pioneered the concept of motorized concentration warfare, but was ultimately defeated by Vladimir Kappel.\n\nAlongside several high ranking Bolsheviks and Red Army leaders, Tukhahevskiy escaped to France, a nation he was already familiar with, and offered his service to the newly established Commune. In the following years, he dedicated his time to essay after essay on the reforms which he believed the French army needs - his close associates said that he owns over a hundred volumes on military tactics and has read every single one. Tukhachevskiy expressed dismay at the decentralized, Syndicalist structure of the Commune, believing it unfit for modern warfare, and proposed the creation of a unified, centralized, apolitical army. Because of this, he came into constant conflict with the Faure government, but the CGT could not simply remove him from the academy - even they understood that Tukhachevskiy was the best general which the Internationale has available.\n\nTo resolve this, he and the other Bolsheviks were sent to Patagonia to lead a military mission to help the Argentinean Revolution."

Born to an impoverished Georgian family, Ioseb was physically disabled from young age and had a troubled childhood, marked by fights, abuse and alcoholism. Early in his life, he got drawn to Georgian nationalist poetry and enrolled in the Tiflis Seminary, but abandoned his previous calling when he came into contact with socialist literature. He dedicated himself to Marxism, joined the Bolshevik faction of the RSDRP, and raised money for the revolution with protection rackets, counterfeiting and bank robberies. He was a loyal follower of Lenin and represented the party in the public by running the newspaper 'Pravda', and his articles there helped make a name for himself as well.\n\nDuring the fateful months of 1917, Dzhugashvili helped organize the July Days uprising and the October Revolution, and gained a seat in the Sovnarkom. He, Lenin and Trotsky formed the informal troika which controlled the state - as a result, Dzhugashvili was sent to Tsaritsyn to organize resistance against the Whites, where he showed himself as an okay, if reckless commander. Once Lenin was assassinated in August 1918, it was Trotsky who took charge and not him - but the Soviet state was not one to last, eventually collapsing. Dzhugashvili, unlike Trotsky, managed to escape, making his way to France with the rest of the Bolshevik remnants, and helped reestablish the Party in exile.\n\nTo support the Patagonian Syndicalist revolution, Dzhugashvili was sent to the Southern Cone alongside a mission of other Bolsheviks, and alongside Tukhachevskiy, he is one of the highest ranking Internationale officials in Patagonia, albeit unlike Tukhachevskiy, representing the political interests of the Internationale.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Aligned with the Communist faction."

The Revolution of 1917 left the seventeen year old Chuykov unemployed, but thanks to the contacts of one of his older brothers, he was recruited into the Red Guards, and from there, into the Red Army.\n\nChuykov achieved the rank of company commander, showing off skill at commanding troops, but ending up fairly inconsequential in the grand events beyond his understanding. He did, however, manage to escape to France alongside the remnants of the Red Army. Separated from his home, his family and whatever was left of his ordinary life, he had only one path left to pursue - join the Bolshevik remnants, enroll for officer training and become a commander in the French army.

POLITICS_GRIGORY_ZINOVIEV_DESC:0 "Born in a wealthy family in Yelisavetgrad, Ukraine, Zinoviev, however, became a member of RSDRP and a revolutionary in 1901. Because of his actions, he had to flee to Europe where he got acquinted with Lenin and quickly arose to become one of his closest allies along with Lev Kamenev. Before the October Revolution, he criticized Lenin's idea of armed revolt and advocated for a homogeneous socialist government though. Despite critisim, he supported Lenin in many cases and he was chosen the leader of the Bolsheviks after Lenin's death. Zinoviev was one of the main organisers of the Red Terror and repressions against non-socialist opposition. In 1920, a few months before the end of the Civil War, the party has split into two. While RKP was mostly in immigration and underground, the opposition in RKP, Bukharin, Shaposhnikov and Rykov established their own party and Kerensky even legalized their party, however banning them from elections. On the other hand, Kamenev, Zinoviev and Preobrazhensky became known as the Old Guard and left for France, however still supporting underground activities in Russia. In 1936 RKP are still banned in Russia and even their former allies in NSP are unlikely to lift a ban, however, if the situation in Russia will be too destabilized, they can hope for restoring Bolshevism in Russia again."

POLITICS_VLADIMIR_PURISHKEVICH_DESC:0 "Vladimir Purishkevich was born on August 24th, 1870 to an impoverished noble family. Despite his beginnings, he was able to earn a degree in classics, and his interest in politics only grew from there. In 1905, during the Russian Revolution, he was one of the principal founders of the powerful Black Hundredist movement. At the time, the movement suffered from crippling infighting, and Puriskevich himself had several rivals in the organization. Puriskevich had a role in the 1916 killing of Grigori Rasputin, believing his influence on the Tsarina and the country as a whole to be too dangerous to ignore. He developed many of his strongly anti-semitic, nationalist, and monarchist views during the Russian Civil War, in which he came to believe in an open fight against Jewry. \n\nWhen the Civil War ended, Puriskevich was not idle. His restlessness and charisma were powerful tools that he used to great success in propelling the RNSMA to national status, but they remained a fringe organization due to the existence of the republic. Now that they are in power, this situation has changed. Though he is old, Puriskevich will not squander the opportunity he has been waiting for for decades. His plans to restore the Russian Empire to greatness as one nation under one tsar will not be stopped by any means, and he will see to it that Russia is no longer the laughing stock of the world."

This, and the recent surge of Arabian nationalism, originating from Egypt and Hashemite Arabia, puts our state and its foreign interest in grave danger. To have any hope to survive the approaching struggles with our hostile Arabian neighbours, we must quickly stabilise our eastern borders.

The field of technology was included in this - in the efforts to break the trench warfare of the Western Front, military technology created bold new inventions such as landships in the hopes of finally turning the tide. As result of mobilisation such as this, the line between civilian and military resources became somewhat blurred - and the recent growth of ever-present international tensions have ushered the start of a global arms race, something that nobody can afford to be left behind in.\n\nTo this end, the old and prestigious Russian Academy of Sciences has been given a new mandate by [RUS.GetNameDef] - the coordination of research efforts across Russia and her allies, and the swift dissemination of breakthroughs between them, particularly breakthroughs with potential military applications. As we are currently on very good terms with Russia, we have been extended an invitation to contribute talent to this program and share research between us and other participating nations.

However, in 1924, in the aftermath of the Kolchak Putsch, the whole Don-Kuban region was divided between German and Ottoman spheres of influence. The Don and Kuban Hosts became quasi-states under German protection that ensured the oil shipments to Germany. The Mountain Republic, on the other hand, fell under Ottoman protection, but served the same oil issue. It is hard to imagine that Germany will give up its subjects in the Caucasus, as they won't get the oil and face a serious crisis."

rusfor.1237.d.defeat:0 "Disaster! Our attempt to march into Bessarabia and reclaim that which is ours has been met with far more resistance than we originally envisioned! Not only have the Romanians held off the brunt of the initial assault, but they have also managed to repel us for quite some time by now! If this embarrassment continues, our military machine will become the laughingstock of the world!

rusfor.1273.d:0 "After the annexation of Central Asia, we got many new Muslim citizens, who were ruled before by the local obscurantist priests and preachers. It is obvious, that we have to do something with their legacy and turn our new citizens into loyal and peaceful members of the Russian society. Now we have two propositions - we can establish a special Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Central Asia or give an additional powers to the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly, which is controlled by the loyal Tatars and Bashkirs."

rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."

rusfor.1276.t:0 "Control over Azerbaijan"
rusfor.1276.d:0 "Since we have given our guarantees to Azerbaijan, the Russian business uses the profits of the cooperation between two countries. Maybe now it is the best time to expand our control over this Caucasian country and strengthen our positions in the Caspian region?"

rusfor.1276.b:0 "We don't need it."

rusfor.1277.t:0 "Restoring control over the Northern Caucasus."
rusfor.1277.d:0 "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a:0 "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."
rusfor.1277.b:0 "Continue Krasnov's policy - support the Terek Cossack Host and its nations."
rusfor.1277.c:0 "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1278.d1:0 "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transfered the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has begun to recover very quickly, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.d2:0 "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.d3:0 "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations. But in the non-Russian parts of the region only some Christian nations support our army, while in some Muslim villages the local people try to start a guerrilla against Russia. No doubt we will stop it and punish the criminals, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is restored."
rusfor.1279.d:0 "More than six months have passed since we had retaken Don-Kuban Union. We could finally restore control over the whole region and set up a new local authorities, which help us to pacify Northern Caucasus. The local Russians and other Christian nations have strengthened their positions and are finally free from raids and attacks of the hostile tribes, rebellious nations accepted our rule and the criminals who fought against us either died or immigrated. The new era of the prosperity in the Russian South finally starts!"

rusfor.12810.d:0 "As the War in the Desert reaches a climax, it seems the Ottoman Empire has reached a point of complete collapse, and their forces are in full retreat from Mesopotamia and the Levant. This is a perfect opportunity for us to regain the provinces of Greater Armenia, as the alternative for them is to declare war on us."

rusfor.1280.d:0 "The lands of the Kuban Cossack hosts at the Black Sea, was historically a part of the Russian Empire until, during the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution and ensuing Civil War and German Intervention. Russia seems ready to reincorporate this petty state into the Motherland. How shall we proceed? Whatever course of action we take, we must be prepared for a conflict of interests with Ukraine, as they will certainly not take lightly our ambitions, especially towards a state friendly to them."
rusfor.1280.a:0 "Start consulting with Ukraine."
rusfor.1280.b:0 "Start sending agitators."

rusfor.1281.t:0 "Russia wants to seize Kuban"
rusfor.1281.d:0 "The Russian ambassador has approached the minister of foreign affairs about the [KUB.GetNameDef]. If we withdraw support for the Cossacks and allow the annexation Russia would be much more eager to cooperate with us. Let's remember that Russia has many means of interfering in Don-Kuban so even if we refuse to talk the situation in the Caucasus can change."

rusfor.1463.d:0 "Today the [FROM.GetAdjective] and [ROOT.GetAdjective] foreign ministers have met in Harbin to sign the peace treaty, which is catastrophic for our nation. The treaty was enforced on us and we must avenge it some time in the future. We finally lost Transamur and our influence in Asia has shrunk."
rusfor.1463.a:0 "Too bad!"

rusd.1.t:0 "Political Bombings"
rusd.1.d:0 "The Socialists are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, one of them assassinated a famous General. God only knows who they will kill next time!"
rusd.1.a:0 "I want the head of the bomber on my desk!"

rusd.3.t:0 "Failure of a Bombing Plot"
rusd.3.d:0 "The Socialists are weakening the stability of our Motherland. Recently, they caused a panic in one of the major Russian cities when an assassin tried to kill a famous government representative. Thankfully the bomb went off too early, killing only a few people."

rusd.4.t:0 "Peasant Unrest"
rusd.4.d:0 "Throughout Russian history the peasants' living conditions has always been hard, even during periods of peace and prosperity. Even the emancipation reforms of 1861, which led to the abolition of serfdom, did not improve the situation all that much. Local peasant protests against their grim position, as well as landowners' illegal actions, were common."
rusd.4.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.5.t:0 "Agitation in the Countryside"
rusd.5.d:0 "With the situation in the countryside growing increasingly unstable, the peasants are becoming easy to influence, with various agitators taking advantage of the unrest. One such situation has recently taken place; a charismatic activist visited a number of villages calling for open revolt against our regime. How should we react to this potential threat?"
rusd.5.a:0 "Let him agitate, we have more important business."
rusd.5.b:0 "Eliminate the agitator!"

rusd.6.t:0 "Major Peasant Unrest"
rusd.6.d:0 "Agitated by various groups, the impoverished peasantry has risen up. The local administration is powerless against the mob and it seems that the only way to solve the crisis is to use force. Alternatively we can always attempt to negotiate, although satisfying the peasants' demands may turn out to be quite expensive."
rusd.6.a:0 "Send the army to eliminate the threat!"
rusd.6.b:0 "Attempt to negotiate and fulfil some of their demands."
rusd.6.c:0 "Fully agree to the peasants' demands."

rusd.7.t:0 "Workers' Demonstrations"
rusd.7.d:0 "Even though technological advancement resulted in a slow but steady improvement of working conditions, the workers remained very vulnerable to Socialist agitation. Demonstrations in cities were organised from time to time, their demands varying depending on who was pulling the strings."
rusd.7.a:0 "Oh well..."

rusd.8.t:0 "Workers' Strike"
rusd.8.d:0 "Some workers in one of our cities have organised themselves and began to strike, completely disrupting all industrial production within the city. They demand higher salaries and enforcement of labour regulations preventing unfair treatment of the workforce."
rusd.8.a:0 "Fulfil their demands."
rusd.8.b:0 "Ignore their demands."
rusd.8.c:0 "Send in the army to pacify them!"

rusd.9.t:0 "Negotiating with the Strikers"
rusd.9.d:0 "An attempt to negotiate with the striking workers has been made. All political forces in the country closely watch the meeting, and some are hoping that the strike will become an impulse for further reforms in Russia."
rusd.9.a:0 "Stall the negotiations."
rusd.9.b:0 "Reach an agreement, but keep the reforms to a minimum."
rusd.9.c:0 "Reach a thorough agreement."

rusd.10.t:0 "Harsh Measures"
rusd.10.d:0 "The commander of a local army garrison has proposed that we use brute force in order to disperse the strikers and force them to go back to work."

rusd.10.b:0 "No, we must not be too harsh."

rusd.11.t:0 "The Strikers give up!"

rusd.12.a:0 "Excellent!"

rusd.13.t:0 "General Strike"
rusd.13.d:0 "Workers organisations all over the Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike. Even though the response to their initiative has been rather limited so far, it is very possible that more and more workers will join the strike, should the situation continue to deteriorate."
rusd.13.a:0 "Damned Socialists!"

rusd.14.t:0 "General Strike expands"
rusd.14.d:0 "Workers from other factories have joined the general strike. The situation is on the brink of eruption."

rusd.19.t:0 "Blackhundreds Overthrow The Government"
rusd.19.d:0 "The rigging was suspected and the RNSMA has overthrown the government with the help of pro-monarchist officers. The arrests of socialists have already started and it seems that the situation is bad for the republican forces. Now they have the only way to escape or to accept the new regime."
rusd.19.a:0 "Long Live Monarchy!"

rusd.20.t:0 "Blackhundredists restore the monarchy."

rusd.21.t:0 "Revolution!"
rusd.21.d:0 "The workers demand a return to the proletarian government, the peasants take away the land from the state, and the Internationale sounds again on the streets of the capital! Soviets have been formed all over the country, with the Supreme Soviet standing above them all and claiming political power equal to our government.\n\nDue to the fact that earlier the government got rid of the army mutiny and the influence of conservative generals, the new workers' and peasants' Soviet government practically met no resistance, and soon red flags were flying all over the country."
rusd.21.a:0 "The Constitution forbids such a thing!"

RUS_Future_Of_The_Republic_civil_war:0 "Our country will plunge into civil war!"

rusd.22.t:0 "Senate Seizes Power"
rusd.22.d:0 "It's been almost 6 months since the political crisis in Russia has started. Today several high senators proclaimed the Senate's sovereignity in Russian Republic. Moreover, they argue, according to the constitution, as Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov is current acting president of Russia, it is his supreme duty to restore the control in the country. The Senate, due to the Duma's unability to form a coalition and elect the government, proclaims Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov an incumbent President of the Russian Republic."
rusd.22.a:0 "Another Romanov?"
rusd.23.d:0 "PSR was unable to secure its weak power across in Russia. Today several high military commanders, under the leadership of Lavr Kornilov, with the help of Russian Army have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities.

rusd.26.d:0 "Today there is an armed riot in Petrograd. At first, workers have organized a strike, but it quickly exploded in a mass unrest. The most worrying is however that some of the officers refused to disperse a crowd and joined them. The situation is getting out of control and we should make an important decision."
rusd.26.a:0 "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."

rusd.51.t:0 "Choosing the Prime Minister"
rusd.51.d:0 "The prime minister is one of the most important officials in the Russian Republic, who can define Russian internal policy. Currently, we have 4 candidates to choose. The first one is to leave Felix Yusupov, best friend of Dmitriy Pavlovich and current prime minister. THe second one is to choose Vasily Shulgin, leader of the VNS party, white general. The third one is to choose popular amongst conservatives Anton Denikin, a bit too authoritarian, but experienced general. The last choice is to elect the leader of the Natsional-Demokraty Faction, Nikolay Trubetzkoy, the least famous, but a prominent politician."

rusd.53.t:0 "Forming Cabinet of Ministers"
rusd.53.d:0 "Kornilov has consolidated his junta, but to increase efficiency of his rule, he now should decide on a ministers' cabinet. Boris Savinkov, a former terrorist and socialist turned populist and nationalist and protector of the Russian peasants in the Duma, a talented writer, as well as the leader of the Combat Squads in the different Russian cities and towns, Savinkov is ready to accept the role of a Kornilov supporter and to start rebuilding the Russian society on the basis of his ideology of National Renewal. Another variant is Pyotr Wrangel, Kornilov's ROVS assistant. However, Kornilov is a popular and charismatic leader. The third way is to leave him as a head of government and prepare for taking on the mantle of the Supreme Ruler of Russia."
rusd.53.a:0 "Invite the Vozhd of the peasants into the government!"

Now nothing can stop Savinkov from merging posts of the president and the prime-minister and thus becoming unassailable in his leadership over Russia. The second variant is a military clique led by Denikin that will succeed Kornilov's junta in its core meaning."
rusd.54.d.denikin:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Two cliques are poised to seize control after Kornilov's passing. The first is led by the young officers of Baron Pyotr Wrangel. By no means a liberal, the Baron, however, knows that Russia must modernise and the societal issues of the state be resolved by a certain amount of governmental pragmatism. In opposition stands field marshal Anton Denikin, who favours continued authoritarian military rule solidified by strong traditionalism."
rusd.54.a:0 "Boris Savinkov merges the posts of president and prime-minister."

rusd.66.d.denikin:0 "Denikin has consolidated his power, but now it is time to decide the future of Russian politics. The first choice is to restore democracy under a constitutional monarchy. However, this would take place under an authoritarian conservative rule, rather than the liberal democratic system that some have clamored for for years. the second one is to declare Denikin the Supreme Ruler of Russia and stay as a military dictatorship." 
rusd.66.d.wrangel:0 "Wrangel has consolidated his power, but now it is time to decide the future of Russian politics. The first choice would be to give Kirill I his rightful place as Russian Tsar, which would restore the old absolute monarchy. Another, perhaps more controversial option would be to proclaim Wrangel the Tsar of Russia, while also maintaining military rule."

### Unsorted ###

rusd.35.t:0 "Status of the Orthodox Church"
rusd.35.d:0 "Article 5 of the Constitution of the Russian Republic states that 'Russia is henceforth a state in which no faith or belief can have privileges and rights which other faiths do not share, and religion does not have a say in government'. For a country which, up to that point, was built upon the Russian Orthodox Church, this was a rather shocking change in policy which many people could not agree with. In 1927, the Church saw a new Patriarch rise - Kirill, who has since been vehement in his crusade to amend the Fifth Article and grant the Church a prestigious status in the Russian republic. Now that Kerenskiy is gone and new people are in charge, he has officially petitioned the government to amend the Constitution and elevate the Church to the status of a state religion."
rusd.35.a:0 "Repeal Article 5."
rusd.35.b:0 "Russia shall stay secular!"
rusd.35.c:0 "The Church must have a role in the government"

rusd.36.t:0 "The Liberals Criticise the Clergy"
rusd.36.d:0 "It seems that the liberal elements of our society consider it rather unwise to maintain such strong bonds between the Church and the state. During a small demonstration in the capital, they have demanded more religious pluralism and secularisation of the government."
rusd.36.a:0 "Let them shout!"

rusd.37.t:0 "The Clergy criticises our Government"
rusd.37.d:0 "A number of priests have voiced their disagreement with our policy of a secular and modern state. Even though this fact has little importance, we must keep in mind that religion plays a huge role in common people's lives."
rusd.37.a:0 "Progress cannot be stopped!"

rusd.38.t:0 "The Patriarch criticises our Government"
rusd.38.d:0 "Seeing increased displeasure among the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state. Even if we try to turn a deaf ear on the clergy's demands, we cannot easily ignore a character so influential and powerful such as the patriarch."
rusd.38.a:0 "Everything shall stay as it is!"
rusd.38.b:0 "Encourage a national debate on religious matters."
rusd.38.c:0 "He is right, declare Orthodoxy our state religion!"
rusd.38.e:0 "Root out these narrow minded elements!"

rusd.49.t:0 "Unrest Among the Military"
rusd.49.d:0 "The election of Shlyapnikov to the position of interim president seems to have caused negative repercussions. Much of the top military leadership have vocally spoke out against his premiership and it is alleged that privately, those generals both vocal and quiet of the situation have signalled that they would not intervene were the president to be deposed. Among the lower levels of the military there has been great unrest with reactionary agitation whipping the soldiers into an unruly frenzy."
rusd.49.a:0 "Worrying."

rusd.125.t:0 "Bastion of Democracy"
rusd.125.d:0 "Maintenance of the democratic regime combined with the stable development of the state led to the emigration of some celebrities from syndicalist countries to Russia. This led, for example, to the arrival in Russia of the good friend of Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov, Coco Chanel. That mademoiselle Chanel has chosen to open her office in a village near Tula shows that Russia is a Bastion of Democracy, where everyone can run his or her business without difficulties from the government."
rusd.125.a:0 "Glamour in his democracy!"

rusd.126.t:0 "Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech"
rusd.126.d:0 "Germany's defeat at the hands of combined French and Russian arms some time ago has sent shockwaves across the world, and it has become apparent that this 'Second Weltkrieg' has changed the face of Europe for years to come. The continent has been divided between the Third Internationale and the Russian bloc, both of which wield enormous forces and have a bone to pick with the other side. And yet, neither of them have chosen to strike first, leaving the continent split in twain.\n\nThe Petrograd University in Russia has had the honour of hosting Sir Winston Churchill, a noted British statesman, writer, and former First Lord of the Admiralty of Britain. Speaking to the attending students, Churchill first made sure to note the great sacrifices which the Russian nation has made during the Second Weltkrieg, and assured that the British Empire and Russia shall always be natural allies in this new world order. The politician described Europe as a continent divided between two fundamentally different forces - one of liberty and one of Syndicalist terror, one of good and one of evil, and that an Iron Curtain divides them. He expresses his dismay that so much of Europe's heritage and famous cities now lie in the "French sphere", and hope that Russia and the Commonwealth can unite against this revolutionary threat.\n\nThough Churchill was not the first to express this idea, the striking imagery of his speech have set a new checkpoint in history. Europe, and with it, the world have been divided in a frozen conflict, one of ideological strife rather than power balance. It may only be solved via subversion, arms race and diplomacy...or a conflict far more destructive than the Second Weltkrieg."
rusd.126.a:0 "A new age in world history..."

rusd.220.t:0 "Our Industrial Development Improved!"
rusd.220.d:0 "Due to our efforts in industrializing our country, our current minister of economy has reported to the government, that the pace of industrial growth allows us to talk about bringing our economy to a new level. Despite the fact that we cannot yet fully reckon with Western countries in terms of the level of development of our economy, in the near future we will definitely approach the moment when we can call our country industrially developed."

### Gorgulov Events ###

russia.442.t:0 "The Formation of Great Skythia?"
russia.442.d:0 "Pavel Gorgulov - the Green Vozhd and the reborn Son of the Skythians - has led our peasant armies and the Green Legion to victory after triumphant victory, conquering all the lands of Old Skythia and beyond under the unstoppable tide of our forces. Always a true believer in the storied tradition of the Old Skythians, it is no secret that Gorgulov has modeled much of the new Russian culture on exaggerated accounts of Skythian history, but now he could take it one step further. With the old nomadic lands of the Geloni, the Saka, the Budini, the Androphagi, and all the other Skythian tribes from antiquity all being consolidated into our national fabric by Gorgulov’s hand, there is no one in the way to stop him should he decide to take this fascination even further. \n\nSure, we could go on living in our new Russian Peasant's State, continuing to live our simple Russian lives according to our long, tedious, yet stoic Russian history and culture, but why settle for being mere Russians when we could be Skythian! If we were to indulge Gorgulov’s ‘appreciation’ for Skythian culture, we could finally push the mildly unhinged Green Vozhd to lose all inhibition and fully begin to reform our nation into the reincarnation of the Great Skythia of antiquity! As if we lept from the pages of history and Herodotus’ writings, Skythia can be reborn if we so will it. The noble nomadic warrior culture of these long-lost demigods does not have to be lost, for we can bring it back to life here in our newly consolidated nation. What course shall the Green Vozhd Gorgulov take us on at this all-important crossroads?"
russia.442.a:0 "Like Koloksai and Palacus before him, Gorgulov too shall rise to rule Skythia!"
russia.442.b:0 "Skythia is dead, and our Russia is their new successor. We keep our culture and our name!"

russia.443.t:0 "Choosing the flag of the Skythian nation"
russia.443.d:0 "With the revival of Great Skythia and its warrior-nomad culture under the benevolent rule of the Green Vozhd, we are now presented with the opportunity to adopt a new flag to represent this revival. The issue arises in the fact that the old Skythia never truly had a national flag. However, inspired by the art of the era, Gorgulov has been presented with the choice of two flags - both representing the same iconic deer with the “looped” antlers. The question remains, what colour pattern shall the nation use for this design?"
russia.443.a:0 "§bBlack§! & §YYellow§!"
russia.443.b:0 "§bBlack§! & §WWhite§!"
russia.443.c:0 "The current flag will do."
russia.443.e:0 "Slightly change the current flag."

### Abakumov Events ###

russia.450.t:0 "The Great Purge"
russia.450.d:0 "Our Vozhd, Viktor Abakumov, is no stranger to security and law enforcement, being part of Boris Savinkov's private circle and having insured against his many detractors, be they socialists, tsarists or others. Despite his experience, one thing that even Abakumov did not see coming was the betrayal of Gorgulov and his green armies, who mercilessly murdered our former leader and tried to take over Russia to impose their demented primitivist vision.\n\nHowever, Abakumov has learned from his mistakes, and now that he is Vozhd, he will not tolerate treason in our ranks! That's why, after long investigations, Abakumov has ordered large-scale purges of the party in order to ensure the loyalty of its cadres suspected of showing sympathy towards Gorgulov's cause, towards the old Tsar or even towards socialism, and to provide stability as our country emerges from recession and starts to regain its place in the world!\n\nSome will call him a ruthless tyrant, but the real Russians know that Abakumov is undertaking these purges for the good of the nation and the people!"

rusd.142.a:0 "Everything for the country!"

rusd.143.t:0 "Avenge For 1905"
rusd.143.d:0 "The very idea of liberalism, democracy, republicanism is a poison, that envenoms the lives of Russian citizens. We are an Orthodox state, led by our mighty Tsar and blessed by God. The distemper has pervaded the mind of Russians with the nonsense that they can rule themselves. The ones have overthrown the Tsar, the others have killed them. Everything has led to Revolution, Civil War, blood and vain 15 years of republican rule. But now it is time to end republicanism in Russia. We shall now protect the Russian monarchy once and for all."
rusd.143.a:0 "Long Live Russia! One and Indivisible!"

rusd.144.t:0 "Union of Nikolay II"
rusd.144.d:0 "'Union of the perpetuation of the legacy of the Nikolay II' or just 'Union of Nikolay II' is an organisation, founded by the former tsarist officials such as Pyotr Bark and Vladimir Kokovtsov, who want to keep the remembrance of the last Russian tsar and his policy. They have proposed a program of the events to show the role of Nikolay II for the Russian people all over the country. The Senate pointed out that we should support this union to establish close connections with the former, but powerful officials. It should allow us to gain some votes of the conservative members of the local and state Dumas."
rusd.144.a:0 "We will remember Nikolay for all his good deeds for Russia."

rusd.145.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the [ROOT.GetLeader], who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. The President, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give [ROOT.GetLeader] the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nikolay II and president Kerenskiy didn't have. Nothing can stop the President from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"
rusd.145.a:0 "Long live the Aristocrats!"

rusd.146.t:0 "Endless Deadlock"
rusd.146.d:0 "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov on the top of the Senate unfortunately couldn't stop the lasting crisis, which weakens Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago. It seems that Dmitriy Romanov has to fight for the support also against some of the senators."
rusd.146.a:0 "Oh well."

rusd.147.t:0 "NRPR Goes Bankrupt"
rusd.147.d:0 "Boris Savinkov's NRPR has seen a meteoric rise in popularity during the past few years. All the massive rallies they constantly hold and armed paramilitaries they own are not free, however. Hoping to break from obscurity as quickly as possible, Savinkov and the NRPR took loan after loan to fund their political campaigns, and they hoped that they would be able to write off all of their debts upon coming to power. This has not happened and the National Populist movement has found itself severely indebted, with no way to pay off their staff or workers, and popular support for them waning because of ongoing economic stabilization.\n\nSavinkov was forced to lay off campaigners, disband many of the party's branches, and significantly cut the size of the Combat Squads. His movement has started to splinter, the left wing has broken off and its leaders began blasting Savinkov in national newspapers, accusing him of running the NRPR as a clique of yesmen...all in all, it has not been a good year for them. Popular support for the NRPR has decayed, their rallies have ceased, and their deputies in the Duma have chosen to ally with the Octobrists and Eurasianists.\n\nIt appears that Savinkov's hopes of taking power in Russia have been dashed for good."
rusd.147.a:0 "And nobody shed a tear."

rusd.148.t:0 "New Aristocracy"
rusd.148.d:0 "Though the noblemen in the Senate could defeat this terrible republic and restore the Empire, but they had to admit that the support of the new capitalists and industrialists played the significant role in this restoration. That's why it is the perfect time to show them our gratitude - the most powerful representatives of these classes, who helped us to strengthen the power of the Senate will get a title of nobility, which their descendants will be able to get as well."
rusd.148.a:0 "It's good to be a part of the elite!"

rusd.149.t:0 "Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy"
rusd.149.d:0 "In 1908 Grand Duchess Elizaveta Fyodorovna after the murder of her husband gave away her magnificent collection of jewels, including her wedding ring, and sold other possessions to found a Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy in Moscow, which started to assist sick, wounded, and maimed soldiers in their recovery, and to provide for the needs of the poor and orphans. This saint woman, who was killed in 1918 by the Bolsheviks, was de-facto a stepmother of her nephew Dmitriy Pavlovich, who decided to perpetuate her good deeds by making a great contribution into the Convent."

Though Black Monday seriously hurt the factory, the growing power of the aristocracy and businessmen made the market of the luxury vehicles once again very profitable for ZIR. That's why the name 'Triumph' was suggested for the new limousine ZIR-101, which the plant started to produce at the beginning of 1937."

rusd.151.t:0 "Noviy Kurs"
rusd.151.d:0 "Almost immediately upon assuming power as President, [ROOT.GetLeader] began looking into all the ways he could possibly expand his power while remaining in the trappings of the Constitution. The document has got enough errors that it did not take a long time - soon, the President appeared before the Duma again, this time to announce his "New Course" (Noviy Kurs). Under this reform program to the Constitution, the powers of the State Duma have been limited for an indefinite duration of time, and while they remain the main legislative organ in the state, they now have to share their powers with the Senate, which has received the power of legislative initiative, as well as the ability to promulgate executive orders bypassing the Duma outright. As the Senate is far more loyal to the new president than the Duma ever was, it means that [ROOT.GetLeader] has gained a powerful tool at his disposal in order to reform the state to his whim."

rusd.152.t:0 "Elite Gymnasiums"
rusd.152.d:0 "Each city in the Russian Empire used to have a gymnasium, where the smartest children and the children of the local elite studied. With the republican reforms of Kerensky most of these schools were cancelled and all these students had to study together with the sons and daughters of the workers and peasants. The Senators claim that such elite gymnasiums should be restored to be sure that the best representatives of the next Russian generation will have perfect conditions for study. Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums..."

rusd.183.t:0 "Tradition of the Masquerade balls"
rusd.183.d:0 "Masquerade balls were widespread among the Russian nobles and students before the revolution in 1917. With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprising is that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."

rusd.184.t:0 "Mansions of the Aristocrats"

Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the policies of [ROOT.GetLeader]. There is a possible solution to this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."

Playing the role of a "Modern Romanov", Dmitriy finds his appeal among conservative republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, both of whom see a savior in the man. After getting elected by the Senate, the Grand Duke declared it as his first intention to restore stability to the fallen nation - surprisingly, or perhaps not so, he made sure to omit any promises to support democracy in particular. Neither he nor the right-wing Senators who stand behind his back are all that thrilled with the democratic governance which the Left champions, although they're fine with paying lip service to it.\n\nThe people await the first actions of their new President."

After negotiations, the VNS and a plethora of smaller political parties have chosen to join forces, gathering to a tight political alliance named the Conservative Bloc. Its political program calls for extensive political and social reform to maintain stability and prevent the growth of radical left wing forces, it is funded by several industrialist lobbies and supported by aristocrats.\n\nThe Conservative Bloc has thrown its full weight behind President [ROOT.GetLeader], granting him and his government a stable base of supporters in both houses of Parliament."

As long as they did not raise too much of a fuss, they were allowed to keep on living and doing their jobs. The extent to which Russia is rapidly being transformed to Savinkov's wishes intimidates them, as much as it did the socialists, and so they ultimately decided they had enough. Viktor Chernov, Pavel Milyukov and Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams have collectively drafted a manifesto in which they declared the formation of a Movement to Restore the Constitution and sent a demand to Savinkov to resign and allow free elections. \n\nSavinkov was not pleased, and the regime immediately moved against the democrats. A crackdown on democratic leaders has begun, numerous newspapers have been closed and their editors arrested, and the prisons overflowing with political arrests yet again.

rusd.60.d:0 "With the merger of the offices of president and prime minister, Boris Savinkov continued to solidify his grip over the Russian State by penning Directive No. 1 (also known as the first 'Prikaz Vozhdya'). Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'. Furthermore, the directive raised the Combat Squads to the status of a state organisation and a full-blown branch of the government."

rusd.65.d:0 "After the corruption crisis in the government, the NRPR majority in Duma has announced a new law to merge the posts of president and head of government.

rusd.65.a:0 "Hail to the Vozhd!"

rusd.70.t:0 "Corruption"
rusd.70.d:0 "During the rule of Kerensky, the corruption has raised its peak. Businessmen bribing the officials, officials bribing the military high command and so on.

rusd.139.t:0 "Reforming the Senate"
rusd.139.d:0 "The recent political crisis has shown the need for extensive reform of the governmental apparatus. The Senate is a useless talking shop, many officials are corrupt and local authorities conceal the real situation in their regions. All these problems should be solved as soon as possible.

rusd.140.d:0 "After Savinkov's rise to power, the lower house of the Russian parliament - State Duma was dissolved. However some members of the Supreme Privy Council propose to reestablish this authority with the limited powers. Besides the People's Republican Party of Russia (NRPR) led by Savinkov, which will definitely have a majority, various business circles as well as the conservative groups and politicians also want to take part in the election, promising that they will support our new state policy, but they also want to represent their interests and help the government to strengthen the Russian economy as well as the army. Though their support can be important for Savinkov, but there is a chance that once they will try to take control over the country..."

rusd.206.t:0 "Reform the Russian Language?"
rusd.206.d:0 "The reform of the Russian spelling, firstly attempted by the Soviet government, has been cancelled soon after the Weltkrieg by the government of Kerensky. This decision have led to a situation, where part of our citizens use the old written language, especially intellectuals, academics and nobles. The majority, however, use the reformed writing, considered illiterate and demotic by the ruling class. However, the reform has been planned since the early 1900s. This will help to establish the single written language all over the country and get rid of the remnants of the mass illiteracy."

Housing palaces, cathedrals, gardens, administrative offices, and more, this impenetrable compound lies safely wrapped behind the great Kremlin Wall, guarded by the storied towers that give it its unique shape among the other tall buildings reaching into the skies of our capital. \n\nBefore the horrors of the Russian Civil War, the Kremlin was always painted a crisp and pure white, symbolizing its purity and regality as the political heart of the nation. However, as the fires of that bloody conflict burned, so too did our Kremlin, which was fired upon and besieged many times during the civil war. This conflict not only caused scorch marks and decay to wipe away this pristine paint, but has also caused much of the towers and major wall sections to fall into a state of disrepair and squalor - never being repaired or repainted for the Kremlin is as much a political symbol as a martial or national one, and the debate as to how to repair it and if to paint it White again has already been surround with ideological debate. With our state rebounding from the Civil War and the conflicts that followed, both martial and political, many within our cabinet have cried out that now is the time to restore this great fortress to a station of honor, for now we are easily in a position to be able to do so without economic setbacks or significant political pushback. Using funds recently acquired following our economic restructuring, we could launch a renovation and revitalization project to bring the Kremlin back to its state of original awe-inspiring glory. With a new coat of paint and with the entire premises repaired and restored, the Kremlin would once again rise to be one of the most secure and majestic fortresses on the planet. Alternatively, we can merely repair the least amount of facilities and structural damages possible to restore full function to the Kremlin, leaving it with the noble scars of war earned during our centuries-long history of survival and war. Regardless of our decision, the Kremlin shall forever stand as a bastion and beacon of Russian exceptionalism."

Since then, he has served as a beloved artist, snapshotting windows into the Russian way of life, while also dabbling in his first love of chemistry in order to perfect his color-photo technique. \n\nRecently, given state funding and ample time to work in peace, Prokudin-Gorsky has created a stable, reproducible prototype for a full color camera based off the initial notes given to him by his contemporary James Clerk Maxwell, and it was this breakthrough that sealed his ticket to be honored tonight. With [RUS.getleader] meeting with him in person at a gala held in Moscow, Prokudin-Gorsky has been lauded as a Hero of the Russian Nation, and a banquet is to be held in his honor amid a gallery of his carefully curated best works - some of which are on generous loan from the American Library of Congress who held the only surviving negatives of some of his older works.

Spearheaded by scientists such as Igor Kurchatov, Abram Alikhanov, Georgiy Flyorov and others, our experimental research institutes have formed a sound theory on the potential held by nuclear fission. They were not the only ones, however. It is no secret that nuclear physicists in Germany and the Third Internationale have been delving into the potential of nuclear power as well, and all of them have come to the same conclusion - that it can be weaponised.\n\nIgor Kurchatov and several other Russian nuclear physicists have collectively signed a petition and presented it to [Root.GetLeader], where they have rung alarm bells. Kurchatov informs that foreign scientific journals have ceased any and all publications about nuclear research, even the most mundane reports, which can only mean that it has become confidential information and Russia's enemies must be actively developing nuclear armament. The only answer is to create a dedicated Russian nuclear weapons program - a request which Kurchatov and his peers have been granted. Under [Root.GetLeader]'s personal orders, new facilities have been opened deep in Central Siberia for the RDS-1 project - "Reaktivny Spetsialny Dvigatel" (Reactive Special Engine), which shall recruit Russia's brightest to develop a weapon with the power to manifest Apocalypse on Earth."

rusd.172.t:0 "The Investment Debate"
rusd.172.d:0 "The ability to help fund the Zemstva institutions is a double-edged sword. As it stands, the Zemstva only invest money they gain from local taxes, and if something happens, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetName] can always pin the blame on the local governor and have him replaced, without mentioning the advantages inherent in such a localized form of management. On the other hand, this does limit the scope of what they can achieve. The moment we step in, however, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetName] will be held responsible for anything that fails.\n\nFor this reason, some are recommending cautious - if any - investments on our part. While some cite the need to not get involved in every minor issue in every Siberian hamlet, more market-oriented ministers cite that the Zemstva have largely been doing just fine without our direct intervention and that the state should allow the local governance to function as intended. Other ministers, however, prefer a more direct approach by the government and insist that we can't let a handful of irresponsible career politicians blind us to the potential benefits we could reap by providing state funding to the Zemstva."

rusd.174.d.hospital:0 "Today marked the opening of a new hospital in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName]. As the more localized form of government under the Zemstva allows for local leaders to react more quickly and precisely to the needs of the local citizenry, the new hospital marks a fast response to what could otherwise have turned into a regional health crisis in the wake of our rapid growth. As living standards improve, so too will satisfaction with our government."

rusd.174.d.schools:0 "Thanks to well-placed investments in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName], the state has seen a remarkable up-tick in schools built and teachers being trained. The rapid improvements being made to the education system has led to a marked improvement in the quality of life for the locals. Another success for the Zemstvo is another success for the government as well."

rusd.174.d.housing:0 "A housing program initiated by the local Zemstvo in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] has yielded positive results so far. Already we're seeing reports that homelessness is at a record low. As people's lives improve, so too will their patriotism. After all, fighting for their land is an easier sell when their government makes sure they have a roof over their heads."

rusd.174.d.civilian_industry_1:0 "With a Zemstvo consisting of many wealthy industrialists, [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] has seen considerable investments into building new factories in the region. These newly expanded industrial concerns have proved a boon to the local economy, and the expansion of industry in the region will inevitably be a boon to the state as well."

rusd.174.t.civilian_industry_2:0 "Economic Development"
rusd.174.d.civilian_industry_2:0 "The Zemstvo in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] have pooled their resources and expertise together and embarked on a major economic stimulus plan for the region. Millions of rubles have poured into local companies and the large up-tick in economic activity has acted like a magnet for outside investments as well. Stores and factories have opened in several cities and new railroads are bringing goods from one end of the region to store shelves across Russia. Naturally, these riches will inevitably trickle their way upstream to [RUS.Capital.GetName] as well."

rusd.174.t.military_industry:0 "Increased Arms Production"
rusd.174.d.military_industry:0 "Investments by the local merchants in modernizing production methods in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] have recently resulted in a large up-tick in productivity. With goods filling store shelves at record speeds, we should also count ourselves lucky that the benefits of these investments are trickling down to many of our state-run companies as well. More civilian goods are nice, but we're equally concerned with the more pressing matters of state defense."

rusd.174.d.civilian_industry_3:0 "[RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] has been the epicentre of what can best be described as a localized industrial revolution. A good investment climate, an abundance of expertise and a visionary ruling class has led to the gradual establishment of a new industrial concern in the region.

rusd.174.d.infrastructure:0 "A local governor in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName], appalled by the poor state of the roads in the region, has paid for the construction of new ones out of his own pocket. Over the past several weeks, labourers have put their shovels into the ground and helped to improve our infrastructure. The local papers may be praising his efforts, but it's ultimately the government in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] that reap the benefits of this act of generosity."

We've recently been informed that many factories and companies in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] are poorly run due to gross mismanagement, a situation that unfortunately has flown under the radar for longer than it ought to have. While the governor of the region has stepped in to remedy matters, we're nonetheless left paying the price for not being able to stop this widespread neglect sooner."

rusd.174.t.failure_2:0 "Zemstvo Embroiled in Embezzlement Scandal"
rusd.174.d.failure_2:0 "Though our laissez-faire approach to economic matters has been a great boon to the economy, the lack of oversight means that sometimes the wealth being generated ends up in the pockets of crooks. [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] recently experienced this first-hand when a group of wealthy merchants used their wealth to buy their way into attaining considerable influence over the local Zemstva. With little oversight, they were able to embezzle a good deal of money meant to go to the state's coffers before law enforcement managed to shut their operation down. As their findings seem to indicate that this is merely the tip of the iceberg, however, it seems like we'll be battling this kind of corruption for the foreseeable future..."

rusd.174.t.failure_3:0 "A Zemstvo Needs a Bailout!"
rusd.174.d.failure_3:0 "A string of failed investments and poor planning has led to several key companies involved in a Zemstvo project going so far down into the red that we have no choice but to provide them with a government bailout to keep their projects from utterly falling apart. We'll just have to bite the bullet on this one, tighten our belts, pay up, and tighten our belts in the coming months ahead. Needless to say, the governor that greenlit this will have some explaining to do..."

The day is an official day off, during which festivals, folk games, and free banquets for everyone are held in the central squares of the cities. For many, this day is not only the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of Modern Russia, but also the beginning of Spring, when nature wakes up from a long and cold winter sleep.\n\nState flags and posters are hung up in cities, the annual presidential address is printed in newspapers in connection with the anniversary of the February Revolution, and in 1935 the president spoke for the first time on the radio, where he announced that our country is moving forward on the path of democracy and social justice.\n\nAt the end of the day, festive fireworks are thundering in many cities, the most colorful and largest of which is in Petrograd, marking the final and irrevocable end of the monarchy."

russia.3678.d:0 "Russia is a land full of radicalism, creativity, and an ever-broadening concept of the human experience, making our wild nation home to all sorts of strange and varied movements. From the Social Futurists to the God-Builders, many of these movements have tied themselves to Russian Socialism and Bolshevism, but one movement in particular has been gaining popularity across the state. \n\nCalled Cosmism, this new philosophical and cultural wave emerged at the turn of the 19th century, and has since expanded and diversified as we have marched through the decades. Based on notions tied to Transhumanism, Interplanetary Travel, and Cosmological Evolution, Cosmism was first inspired by Science Fiction authors such as Jules Vernse and H.G Wells, but has since evolved into a true movement. \n\nWith the early forefathers of this new wave of thought such as Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, Nikolai Kibalchich, and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky all having passed on, the Russian Cosmists have floated around, tying themselves to different Socialist groups such as the Prolekult and the Left-Eurasianists, taking on new ideas along the way. For instance, Alexander Bogdanov - Bolshevik theorist and physician - has long tinkered with the idea of using blood transfusions in order to extend human life expectancy while the followers of the late Tsiolkovsky instead push for interplanetary travel, stellar exploration, and cosmic colonization. Others, like Alexander Chizevsky have dabbled with the idea of Heliobiology, or studying how the Sun and its solar rays impact biology and evolution here on Earth, while some have left the physical realm entirely to theorize on the beyond, such as Vladimir Vernadsky and his notion of the Noosphere - a a new geological layer formed from human thought and evolved rationality called the Sphere of Reason that represents the highest form of biospheric development. Though wildly varied and differing in their views and goals, these strange Cosmist groups and figures all share one foundational idea - that a purely Socialist society is the only type of society that can provide the necessary structures needed for these ideas to flourish and carry humanity onwards to the next step of our evolution."

With the prohibition confirmed, communist newspapers with 'Pravda' as the main source of the news became the only allowed and available in the country. However, it seems that people really don't care what to read - citizens of the young socialist republic purchase all the newspapers available."

russoc.23.t:0 "Question of Kulaks"
russoc.23.d:0 "Kulaks, or well-to-do peasants, are a petty-bourgeois class from a certain point of view, who were able to enrich themselves through the use of wage labor and engaged in rural usury. On the one hand, reliance on the petty-bourgeois peasants in our agrarian policy contributes to the entrenchment of capitalist relations in the countryside, and from the point of view of the Socialist-Revolutionary doctrine, this is an inevitable sabotage against the Soviet government. On the other hand, we can allow the Kulaks to coexist with the Soviet government, hoping for the enrichment of the village and cooperation."
russoc.23.a:0 "Seize the Kulak land  in favor of cooperatives!"
russoc.23.b:0 "Let them be... for now."

russoc.24.t:0 "Ethnic Soviets?"
russoc.24.d:0 "One of the main questions about the nature of the Soviet system is the representation of minorities. The Left SRs have suggested to create Ethnic Soviets in order to represent various ethnicities in the lands of the former Russian Empire. However, critics say that this is against internationalist doctrine and can bolster nationalism in the country."
russoc.24.a:0 "This will definitely help."
russoc.24.b:0 "This will only stimulate nationalism!"

russoc.25.t:0 "Formation of Profintern"
russoc.25.d:0 "Solomon Lozovsky has delivered a speech, offering the government to establish the Profintern - the Internationale of Trade Unions that will help the workers globally. Even though in many syndicalist countries the Trade Unions congresses are controlling the government, there are still many democracies where trade unions are still allowed and workers need more social security."
russoc.25.a:0 "Send the invitations."

russoc.26.t:0 "Invitation to Profintern"
russoc.26.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has offered us to assist our trade unions and join the Profintern organisation. The 'Internationale of Trade Unions' aims to create an organisation of trade unions in order to achieve security of workers rights globally. They also stated that their task is not the destruction, but the conquest of the trade unions, that is, the multimillion mass that is in the old trade unions."
russoc.26.a:0 "That sounds shady..."
russoc.26.b:0 "We see benefits in this organisation. Let us join."

russoc.30.t:0 "New Female Image"
russoc.30.d:0 "The new Soviet culture equally rejects both the bourgeois consumer approach to life and the commercial attitude to the dominance of sexuality in female beauty, offering its own solution to the issue: a new type of femininity, based on naturalness, health, hygiene and a complete rejection of the use of decorative cosmetics. An exemplary Soviet beauty should adhere to the following fundamental principles of femininity: neatness / neatness, cleanliness, professionalism, modesty and only in special cases — elegance. \n\nIn addition, the point of view began to dominate that a woman is not only equal in rights to men, but should also be a mother-worker. The image of a working-mother (Rabotnitsa-Mat'), universally propagandizing work and family values, became the basis of our new Soviet culture. The new female image should become an example for the whole world."
russoc.30.a:0 "All the women of the world are following you to fight against capital!"

russoc.31.t:0 "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution"
russoc.31.d:0 "Maria Spiridonova is not just a revolutionary terrorist, but now the leader of a capital-free Russia, so the image of the "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution" immediately began to take shape around her. Participation in the first Russian revolution and the subsequent ones largely secured this complimentary nickname for her. Moreover, Maria Spiridonova became the first woman at the head of Russia, which in many ways spurred feminists, suffragettes and women all over the world. Ready to lead Revolutions forward and liberate all women of the world, Maria Spiridonova became the new idol of socialism all over the world. \n\nA cult of personality also began to form spontaneously around her, which, however, manifests itself in the universal imitation of the image of Spiridonova, as well as the mass movement of women in Councils at all levels."
russoc.31.a:0 "Long live Russian Revolution!"

russoc.35.t:0 "Suspicious Nomination"
russoc.35.d:0 "Today was the most ordinary day in Soviet Russia. Peasants and workers were working, and almost no one noticed how something terrible happened in the country. Few people have heard that by yesterday's decree, the Soviet government intended to disband the counterintelligence bodies, the Cheka, and give more power to the police, since it no longer saw the need for the existence of this organization for revolutionary terror. \n\nHowever, this did not happen. Instead, today the new deputy head of the country is Yakov Fishman, the head of the Cheka, who clearly claims to be the subsequent nomination for the post of head of the Soviet republic."
russoc.35.a:0 "That's really strange!"
russoc.35.b:0 "Sounds like a coup, better remove him from any power!"

russoc.36.t:0 "Decree on Abolising the Parties"
russoc.36.d:0 "With the filing of Yakov Fishman, today the government adopted a decree on the abolition of political parties for their uselessness and the transfer of full power to the Soviets. The decree caused a wide resonance among the political elite, as well as the public, although, in fact, it does not imply a rejection of the ideology of parties or their ideas, but only makes all Councils non-partisan authorities."
russoc.36.a:0 "Do the government has authority to do so?"

russoc.37.t:0 "Legalist Coup"
russoc.37.d:0 "After the creation of a virtually shadow government, the abolition of parties and the implementation of terror on an even larger scale, a group of left-wing Socialist-Revolutionary politicians and revolutionaries led by Vladimir Trutovsky.\n\nThey declared the presence of the Chekists in power illegal and unjustified and demanded immediate resignation from leadership positions as well as the abolition of the Cheka. \n\nFurther events developed quite quickly, however, it all ended with the fact that..."

russoc.42.d.nep:0 "As the New Economic Policy of Bukharin stated, the private property was never fully abolished, allowing citizens, especially peasants, to own land and make business. However, this is contrary to our new centralist doctrine, as Rykov believes that all property should be nationalized as soon as possible. Though that does not mean we fully abandon NEP, we can give the land to peasants, though without their right to own it. They still can do some profit, but this time the land and everything else shall be nationalized."
russoc.42.d.no_nep:0 "During the times of NEP, the private property was never fully abolished, allowing citizens, especially peasants, to own land and make business. However, this is contrary to our socialist doctrine, as Rykov believes that all property should be nationalized. While the first nationalization policies are already ongoing, there is still much to do and we should nationalize all the private property in our country as soon as possible." 
russoc.42.a:0 "Complete nationalization!"

russoc.43.t:0 "Dissolution of the Union!"
russoc.43.d:0 "Today, our premier, Aleksey Kuznetsov has announced the dissolution of the union in its current form and instead establishing Autonomous Republics as part of Russian SR. This event has outraged many nationalities, that live in our big countries who see Kuznetsov's decision as traitorous to their autonomy and nation. The riots are being suppressed all across the country, especially in Turkestan, Caucasus and Westernmost regions. However, the riots can escalate..."

russoc.44.t:0 "Ukrainian Revolt!"
russoc.44.d:0 "As a response to the dissolution of the union, the Ukrainian Left SRs, led by Aleksandr Shumskiy, have declared Ukrainian independence. The rebels have gathered people and volunteers in the Western part of Ukraine. While they have a right to do so, according to the Unionist constitution, it is no more accepted, as the Union has been dissolved. We must immediately respond to their unauthorized seizure of power!"

russoc.121.t:0 "Death of Bukharin"
russoc.121.d:0 "The leader of the NSP, Nikolai Bukharin has passed away in his house in Moscow. He was one of the symbols of the new Soviet state. The Soviet people will remember Bukharin and his great deeds forever. His duties will be carried out by the Supreme Soviet until the general elections next year. Supreme Soviet has decided to build a Mausoleum in his honour which will be situated in the Red Square, and consist of a big tower, crowned with a sculpture of Bukharin, to glorify their friend and comrade."
russoc.121.a:0 "Goodbye, Nikolai. You can now rest."

russoc.122.t:0 "Leninist Faction Evolves"
russoc.122.d:0 "In the aftermath of Bukharin's death, the NSP party has once again been fractioned with several new faces appearing to be the new leaders. One of them is Martemyan Ryutin, who was a Chairman of workers' and soldiers' deputies in Harbin, who failed and was forced to leave for Ikrutsk. After the civil war he became one of the members of the New Bolsheviks Bloc, but was rather irrelevant, until now. Being a member of the Supreme Soviet, he actively promoted the NEP in public speeches, arguing that if Lenin was alive, he would definitely go with NEP. Calling himself a true Leninist, rallying some supporters, he quickly became known as leader of the Leninist Faction, which seeks to continue the NEP policy, though giving more attention to the workers as well as perpetuating Lenin's name in history of Bolshevism and the Soviets."
russoc.122.a:0 "Interesting."

russoc.123.t:0 "Bukharinist Faction"
russoc.123.d:0 "Shortly after Leninist faction evolved, some of the NSP members have nominated Kosygin, a young economist, as a true successor of Bukharin. Kosygin outlined that the NEP system is perfect for Russia and preserving it is a great good for the country. Moreover, he wants to expand the system. While criticized as a revisionist by some party members, his ideas seem rather attractive to the Soviet people."
russoc.123.a:0 "Another faction evolves!"

russoc.124.t:0 "National-Syndicalist Faction"
russoc.124.d:0 "Shortly after Bukharin's death, it became known about the creation of a faction of national syndicalists within the NSP, led by Aleksey Kuznetsov, a young politician who joined the NSP in 1930. Considering themselves opponents of the NEP and ideological successors of the Rykov and Tomsky cause, the national syndicalists seek to combine centralism and syndicalism, and also, most importantly, to disband the Union, which, in their opinion, should not have existed. In addition, they demand to abandon the Soviet system and switch to the Western model of trade unions as real representatives of the working class. Having criticized Ryutin and Kosygin, the national syndicalists accused them of betraying Russia's national interests."
russoc.124.a:0 "A dangerous movement."

russoc.125.t:0 "[GetYear] NSP Chairman Elections"
russoc.125.d:0 "The time has come to elect the new chairman after the death of Nikolay Bukharin. There are currently several factions struggling for power, notably: Kosygin's Bukharinists, Ryutin's True Leninists and Kuznetsov's National Syndicalists."

russoc.126.d:0 "The Congress of Fabkoms (Factory Committees) or Labour Collectives is to be held in Moscow and unite all the syndicates, recently established in the republic. It shall become the first Congress of such kind and it shall now navigate our economy instead of the Congress of Soviets. Similar to the French Commune system, the Congress of Labour Collectives will be elected only by the workers from the trade unions of all level."
russoc.126.a:0 "Towards workers' democracy!"

russoc.127.t:0 "Amnesty"
russoc.127.d:0 "Today, many of the prisoners of the regime were pardoned by the government. Most of them included the politicans and activists of liberal and bourgeois parties, as well as the Right SR members, like Avksentiev and Chernov. The radical anti-socialists and monarchists, at the same time are still under arrest or imprisoned. The decision was made in order to show that the new revolutionary government won't oppress its opponents by taking away their freedom. Despite that the parties are still banned, the Right SR members were allowed to re-join the new PSR party and take part in politics for the good of peasants and workers."
russoc.127.a:0 "That would be fair."

russoc.128.t:0 "On the Cult of Capital and Its Consequences"
russoc.128.d:0 "Comrades, in the report of the Central Committee of the Party, and in a number of speeches held by delegates to the Congress, quite a lot has been said about the Cult of Capital and about its harmful consequences. Comrade Andrei Zhdanov has reminded us how severely the classics of Marxism-Leninism denounced every manifestation of this Cult of Capital, and with the genius of the Revolution that is Comrade Zhdanov at our helm, we shall make it our mission to eradicate this caustic and decaying force. \n\nCiting that Comrade Nikolai Bukharin and his crypto-capitalist allies as the main source of this corrosive cult, Comrade Zhdanov has declared these sycophants to the damaging New Economic Policy to be traitors to the Revolution, with their revisionist acts being tantamount to national betrayal. Their influence must be thoroughly eradicated so that the wider Union can be secured, and Comrade Zhdanov knows just the way to do so without crippling the State. Through mass centralization, close adherence to Party doctrine and proven ideology and theory as dictated by Comrades Lenin, Rykov, and himself, and through the complete dismantling of the NEP along with the expulsion of its proprietors and supporters, the Nation, the State, the Party, and the People shall all know security and prosperity under a truly red dawn. We are absolutely certain that our Party, armed with the historical resolutions of Comrade Zhdanov, will lead the Soviet people along the Leninist path to new successes and to new victories!"
russoc.128.a:0 "Long live the victorious banner of our party - Leninism-Rykovism-Zhdanovism!"

russoc.129.t:0 "The Downfall of Comrade Malenkov"
russoc.129.d:0 "As Chairman Zhdanov progresses the Party and the State towards our new future tied inexorably to total ideological devotion, anti-technocratic and anti-moderate tensions have exploded in recent months as Zhdanov’s own views against these groups leak into wider public consciousness. Major cities such as Tsentralgrad face large riots and protests against these so-called crypto-capitalist traitors, and what was once to be handled internally has now devolved into a very public scene. \n\nSeeking to quell the unrest and boost his popularity and support while simultaneously eliminating his largest source of detractors and potential obstacles to his plans of centralization, Chairman Zhdanov has publicly proclaimed all enemies to his faction to be traitors to the State. These detractors, centered around Zhdanov’s most fervent rival Comrade Georgy Malenkov, as well as the Techno-Pragmatist whelps, are to be expelled from all government positions or any other seat of power and influenced, reduced to common citizens and forced into secluded early ‘retirements.’ In one fell swoop, Zhdanov has easily been able to legally eliminate most of his political rivals, all with the support of the people, allowing him free reign to reform the State as he saw fit. However, the chaos would not stop for all, for fate had more in store for poor Comrade Malenkov. \n\nExpelled from all public posts and forced into obscurity, Georgy Malenkov had fallen from grace. Once one of the most senior party officials, Malenkov was now reduced to practical imprisonment to a State-provided dacha just a few miles outside his hometown of Orenburg, and it is here - so close to the place of his birth - where Malenkov would meet his final and pitiable end. Eating his buckwheat porridge, blinis, and syrniki with warm Russian tea in the morning air, a single shot rang out from the treeline just a few yards from his patio. Without a whimper or fuss, without commotion, drama, or gravitas, Malenkov slumped back in his lounge chair, lifeless as he bled rapidly from a rifle wound to the neck. Newspapers would pick up the story shortly, with rumors circulating that some lone radical or perhaps a Cheka agent carried out the hit. However, an investigation would never be held, for the State and its new direction did not care - or perhaps already knew. Malenkov represented a pragmatic and compromising past that has no place in our new Union, and for that, he shall be forgotten to history as we march forth into our Soviet future."
russoc.129.a:0 "Do not shed a tear for poor Malenkov, for there is better history to be made!"

russoc.130.t:0 "Relentless Drive Towards Sovietification"
russoc.130.d:0 "With the policy of Sovietification among ethnic Russians themselves well under way, the time soon came for various minorities scattered around the nation to partake in this new cultural revolution as well. Their choice was simple: either renounce the imperialist errors that cling to the backwards idea of 'ethnicity', or deal with the consequences of being stuck in the tsarist past. \n\nWhile most realized the foolishness of their old ways and joined the greatest collective ever known to man - the Soviet identity - some foolishly refused. Those who refused this new glorious destiny were transported to special Sovietification education centers, located across the farthest reaches of the State. The main critics and detractors of our government say that these centers are nothing more than brutal labor camps meant to break the spirit of innocent people who don't follow the party line, but that is nothing more than venomous slander spat out by nationalist madmen and former russificators themselves, all afraid of Great Russian chauvinism disappearing forever. Regardless, their numbers are small, and our republic only grows more centralized, united, and cohesive with every soul reeducated or inducted into this new society. We alone know the true path forward, and we shall show it to all within the State!"
russoc.130.a:0 "We shall not rest until the superstition of 'ethnicity' itself is swept away!"

russoc.131.t:0 "Alcohol Declared 'Capitalist Debauchery'"
russoc.131.d:0 "For far too long, alcoholism has been the greatest vice and sin afflicting the Russian, and now the Soviet, people. From the first vodka plants operated by the Tsars to keep us permanently drunk, stupid, and distracted to the rise of mass-scaled production with the advent of modern Capitalism, alcohol has been a plague for centuries. \n\nWith this in mind, Zhdanov himself has put down the bottle as the first step in a plan to totally rid our union of this liquid sin. Alcohol in all forms is to be declared nothing more than ‘Capitalist Debauchery’, fully outlawing alcohol production and consumption while also making it illegal to keep any alcohol in the home or on your person without permission. The only allowed alcohols shall be certain wines and spirits for culinary and other cultural uses, and will be heavily controlled by the State to ensure there is no abuse of this new law. Additionally, new water bottling plants shall replace the old vodka factories in order to provide the Soviet people with good, wholesome drink that is not a detriment to their physical and mental health, with distribution centers rising in every major city. \n\nThis has led to some pushback, but also a resurgence in other cultural drinks of our people, such as Russian Tea which has exploded in popularity once again as people jump from alcohol to caffeine to curb their addictions. With samovars being a common sight in Soviet households around the nation, Zhdanov is sure that this alcohol-ban is here to stay."
russoc.131.a:0 "No longer shall our nation be a land of drunks and wastrels."

russoc.132.t:0 "Cementing the Cult of Rykov?"
russoc.132.d:0 "A devoted follower of the late Rykov and his principles, Premier Zhdanov has long felt it fitting to honor his former mentor and friend. Before him lies two plans for how to honor the great Rykov. \n\nThe first plan is opulent and grandiose, but still far from gaudy, and revolves around the expansion of Rykov’s cult of personality, with new statues, shrines, and other small offerings and homages to the great Rykov being built all across the State. From the smallest towns to the largest metropolises, everywhere you go, Rykov’s face shall be there, shining his wisdom down onto any onlooker. Though this plan is expansive, it pales in comparison to the alternative. \n\nThe second plan is to not only build these statues and shrines across our Union, but to also build a monumentally-large mausoleum in the heart of the capital in order to permanently house Rykov and other Heroes of the Union once they finally pass. This mausoleum would be one of the largest buildings in the Union, scraping the heavens with its marble spinnerets while decorated in the most extravagant decorations our State can muster, with the beloved Rykov entombed inside a glass sarcophagus for all Soviet citizens to witness. Though some see this as idolatry and borderline dogma, with many critics stating it would overshadow Lenin’s legacy and be a huge waste of resources while also inching far too close to religion or spirituality, Premier Zhdanov has assured these warry minds that this is what Rykov and Lenin would have truly wanted. The final choice however, lies solely on Zhdanov’s shoulders, so how should we honor the great Rykov?"
russoc.132.a:0 "Rykov shall not know true rest until his mausoleum touches the heavens!"
russoc.132.b:0 "New statues and shrines shall be enough to honor the great Rykov."

russoc.133.t:0 "The Forgotten Commission"
russoc.133.d:0 "During our reorganization efforts as we work to centralize the state and prepare Moscow for new development, it was discovered that there was a committee from the original revolution that has been entirely forgotten about - the Commission on Road Paving. A bit of a strange group, it has been deduced that this group once sought to not only modernize the infrastructure network of old Russia, but to also work towards the total urbanization of our capital region as a whole. Their highly ambitious plan would take decades at the least and would cost untold billions, but the prospect of controlling the largest, most advanced, most well-planned city in history is almost too good an opportunity to pass up. \n\nWe can either resign this forgotten commission to the pages of history, condemning them to be forgotten fully as the madmen they were, or we can humor this old plan, establishing the Central Commission of Urban Development and tasking them to slowly transform Tsentralgrad into the largest urban center ever known or even attempted. If they are successful, Tsentralgrad will one day come to span across every square mile of our great State, but until then, this will largely be a job-creating money sink. What shall be our final decision?"
russoc.133.a:0 "They are nothing but fools and madmen, disband the Commission at once!"
russoc.133.b:0 "Perhaps they are onto something. Our metropolis shall span from coast to coast, pole to pole!"

russoc.134.d:0 "Premier Zhdanov has always been a patron of the fine arts. From childhood as a boy in Mariupol, Zhdanov loved to play piano, compose music, and listen to the classics on the radio or on old wax pressings. Now, with Zhdanov rising from that mere boy to become the leader of our glorious new Union, this love of music has not left our Premier, and with his newfound power and with his home city of Mariupol now finally back within Soviet hands, perhaps something can be done to pay homage to this legacy. \n\nA plan has been drafted to construct a massive and ornate concert hall in the city, built in the newly popularized Soviet Realism style, so that Mariupol may truly become the Soviet capital of music and composition. Furthermore, the concert hall shall serve as a gathering space and workshop for our Union’s most popular and beloved musicians and composers so that these fine artists may have a place to work on their masterpieces in peace in the company of other geniuses of their ilk. The plan has been supported heavily by Zhadanov himself, but many of his most dedicated supporters wish to take it a step further, renaming Maripol to be named after Zhdanov himself as a final and ultimate homage to our beloved Premier. Though a name change is not necessary to the completion of the concert hall, perhaps it would be good to cement Zhdanov’s lasting legacy."

This plan, while flexible and successful so far, leaves much to be desired in the mind of Zhdanov, who seeks to fully eradicate the modern Russian language in favor of a new shared Soviet tongue. Zhdanov and his allies have two main ideas on how this new Soviet Language could be formed. \n\nThe first plan, far less far-reaching of the two, is to transliterate Russian into the Latin alphabet before making it mandatory for all Soviet citizens to use as the one accepted language. Despite the relative ease of this plan compared to Zhdanov’s other idea, it would likely greatly anger any non-Russian speaker in the nation. Alternatively, Zhdanov’s more wide-sweeping plan is to combine the many languages of old Russia into one cohesive language based around a Russian foundation, then transliterating it to the Latin alphabet before making it the one accepted language for all Soviet citizens. Though this plan would require far more effort, it would also include aspects of all Soviet groups, creating a truly comprehensive and inclusive Soviet language for all in the State to use without playing favorites with any one group. However, both of these ideas require great effort and fly in the face of the late Rykov’s dream, so the debate around this move has been fierce to say the least. In the end, it is up to Premier Zhdanov to decide the fate of Soviet language."

Some have even evoked the program of collectivization to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destablized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."

However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the amount of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the land compromising this nations.

Now that Kerensky's identity is considered highly controversial, as is his politics, it may be time to restore the old names of these cities under which they saw the glorious times in the history of our motherland, under new names they experienced only the instability and crises of the young Russian democracy."

Now we need to decide the fate of the city: whether we should leave it a German name, or whether it should be renamed Krolevets, as it was called by our ancestors, the Slavs who lived in Prussia before the Germans. Some patriots would like to give the city a new name-in honor of the great figures who raised Russia from its knees, some are in favor of remembering the glorious victories of the Seven Years' War in the new name. The choice is ours."

Mikhail Gordeevich Drozdovsky, with a volunteer detachment of 1000 people, marched 1,700 km from Yassy to Rostov, freed him from the Bolsheviks, then helped the Cossacks to defend Novocherkassk. Drozdovsky's regiment took part in the liberation of the Kuban and the North Caucasus. Drozdovsky was called the crusader of the crucified Motherland. Nervous, thin, Colonel Drozdovsky was a type of ascetic warrior: he did not drink, did not smoke and did not pay attention to the blessings of life; always - from Yassy until now - in the same shabby jacket, with a worn St. George's ribbon in his buttonhole. Now Drozdovsky is in head of leading Russia to its Glory and Holiness, and he's determined to not to stop in fron of any obstacle that may be in his way, after all, he himself say that:\n\n“Only courage and strong will do great things. Only an unshakable decision gives success and victory ”"

If not for them, we would have already got everything done.\n— Are you against the monarchists?\nHe was embarrassed and silent.\n— Against the monarchists, but for a Tsar?\n— For a Tsar? I'm not for anyone. I am not involved in politics. I'm a soldier. I will never recognize the Brest Peace and will never take off my epaulettes. I don't give a damn about the rest.\nHe gets angry. He feels that he is wrong in something, but he cannot comprehend what his mistakes are.:\n— Ah, Volodya, Volodya. It's good to be a colonel, to ride a horse, to dine at Kyub's and look after the ladies in a city. It is also good to shoot down the Hungarian cavalry from a trench. But it is bad to be not even White, but just a bandit, to fight workers in the streets, without a Tsar on the throne and in the head. Is this what we are fighting for?\n— I only know for sure, that constant speeches, squabbles and, again, speeches won't lead us anywhere. Your Nobleness.\nThen he stands silent. The most difficult thing here is that he’s not wrong."

But let me say this, our conflict of interests is the conflict of the past and the future. You are the past, general, and don’t argue with me. The only monarchist option I will genuinely support is Vladimir Kirillovich. He’s just like me, and he knew the consequences of what his reigning relatives were doing back in 1917.

The film is a historical drama depicting the invasion of Novgorod in the 13th century by the dastardly Teutonic Knights, who are defeated and chased out of the nation by the heroic Alexander Nevsky, Prince of Novgorod and an important figure in Russian history. The film has received wide-spread acclaim across Russia for many reasons - its cinematography and special effects is unlike any movie out there, especially with its grand and monumental climax depicting the Battle of the Ice. Many have also commended Eisenstein for his choice to use sound for the first time with the film, as its musical score composed by Sergei Prokofiev is met with admiration and praise. The film itself surprisingly had almost never seen the light of day, due to Einsentein's Jewish ancestry. However, having been baptised, the government green-lighted its production almost reluctantly.\n\nMany film-critics were keen to note the obvious allegory present in the film, as Eisenstein himself had pointed out in an article, between the Teutonic Knights and the German Empire, as well as Novgorod with our Mother Russia. Another theme that was present within the film was the strong sense of traditionalism, with the film acting almost as an outcry to all Russians to embrace their rich culture and history. Arguably, in part due to the massive success of the film, these messages has emboldened the general population, and high morale has been reported amongst our soldiers."

After hours of fierce competition against the likes of other chess masters such as Peter Romanovsky, Nikolai Riumin, Viktor Goglidze, and many more,  this charismatic starlet has trounced them all, emerging from the tournament as the highest national chess champion in all of Russia. This historic victory marks the first time a woman had ever won such an event, truly showing the keen mind the Countess has become famous for. With another new laurel to rest on, the people of Russia cheer as their Countess continues to show what a Russian woman truly can be!"

The Tsar and his family are to be deemed Martyrs, shedding their blood for the sole fact that they were Christian. To many, both within and without Russia, this comes as no shock. It is no secret that the government of [RUS.GetLeader] has been investing and pushing strongly for the late Tsar's canonization almost since he took power.

He told of the struggle of their short few weeks of house assert, their patience in the face of abuse, and their resilience in the face of death.\n\nShortly after the canonization ceremony, [RUS.GetLeader] officially announced a new national holiday, On the [GetDate] of ever year, the Russian shall take the day off to attend Divine Liturgy, and to pay respect to the late Tsar, and remember the evils of Socialism.

Led by great heroes of the Civil War, such as Lavr Kornilov, Pyotr Wrangel, Anton Deninkin, and of course, our own honored Mikhail Drozdovsky, these true sons of Russia fought valiantly at Kiev, Peregonovka, Tsaritsyn, and beyond, slaughtering the Bolshevik menace wherever it sprouted from. Galich has put the realities of these brave men’s sacrifices and heroics to the page in an organized collection so that all of Russia may read of these great deeds and of the great deeds of our Marshall Mikhail Drozdovsky, for without the valiant acts and deaths of these men, all of Russia as we know it would not exist today.

While Kornilov and his supporters expected for some kind of blow black from the population, we hardly expected something from within our own ranks. Based on limited intelligence gathered by Kornilov loyalists within monarchists circles, it appears that Black-Hundredists officers, centered around Mikhail Drozdovsky, are plotting to overthrow our government while it's still in it's infancy. While we have little more then hearsay to back up these claims, many with access to this intelligence, chief among them being Denikin, are calling on Kornilov to purge these officers, to secure our position. While it would weaken our officer pool, with enough men on their side, these monarchists could pose a real threat too our state. The choice, however, is Kornilov's alone to make."

Led by Mikhail Drozdovsky, the group of his veterans, Black-Hundredists and other White officers sympathetic to the royal cause moved to secure government buildings and armories all around the capital. While Kornilovite forces tried to stop them at first, they were quickly overwhelmed in what became an absolute bloodbath on the streets and inside various houses loyalist regiments hid in.\nThe whole situation lasted for roughly eight hours, after which republican generals and senior officers were either arrested or shot while ordinary soldiers were ordered to swear fealty to their new supreme commander. With the battle for soul of Russia itself won by Drozdovsky, he can finally rouse the sleeping masses to save Holy Rus and make their noble ancestors proud."

rusdroz.60.d:0 "Just as in 1598 when Russia faced a secession crisis following the death of Vasili IV, the greatest minds from the Nobility, Clergy and Commoners have once more gathered together to elect a new Tsar for the Empire. As Marshal Drozdovsky has clearly explained to the men gathered, very few truly have a claim to the throne of Tsar Nicholas. Grand Duke Kirill, while the most 'accepted' claimant, is little more then a snake, who would poison Holy Russia if he were to assent to the Throne, due to his traitorous acceptance of the February Revolution. Grand Duke Dmitri, while making no claim to the Throne, has likewise dishonored himself, due to his participation in the murder of Rasputin.\n\nWith this in mind, Marshal Drozdovsky has presented before the Zemsky Sobor two candidates, both from the House of Romanov, but both lacking claims to the Imperial Throne. These two men are Prince Roman Petrovich and Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich. Both men are set to appear before the Zemsky Sobor, before this most hollowed meeting makes it's decision in regards to the new Tsar."

rusdroz.61.t:0 "Prince Roman Petrovich"
rusdroz.61.d:0 "Born in the now burning City of peter in 1896, Prince Roman is the son of the deceased Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich - the occultist socialite infamous for his role in bringing Rasputin to the Imperial Court. Long the black sheep of the Russian Imperial Family, this cadet-branch of the Romanovs is perfectly distanced from the corruption and decadence of the former line, and with the black stain that was the Grand Duke now dead, his titles have fallen to Prince Roman. Nothing like his odd father, Roman served in the Weltkrieg as a sapper on the Turkish Front and has proven himself to be a measured and straight-headed man - fitting qualities for a possible Tsar. Additionally, the Prince has already been wed to a woman of high standing, the Countess Praskovia Sheremeteva, and with her has already sired legitimate issue, staving off any possible succession crisis. All in all, the young aristocrat would be a fitting Tsar for our reborn Empire, but that is not up for our regime or Drozdovsky alone to decide, for only the Zemsky Sobor holds that right."
rusdroz.61.a:0 "...and now for the Zemsky Sobor to decide."

rusdroz.62.t:0 "Grand Duke Boris"
rusdroz.62.d:0 "Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich was born in 1877, being a grandson to Alexander II. Being a member of the Romanov dynasty he has always lived a luxurious lifestyle that was relatively carefree from the nuances of the average day russian peasantry. However he often made himself more notable from the average romanov nobles, besides being a grand duke who often was not thought of in the wider family, he also served as a major general in the army. He still did not make much of his career, preferring parties where he could socialize and enjoy himself. This remained his lifestyle throughout the great war and civil war, where he typically kept his head down from wider monarchist affiliation but kept himself a proud russian noble. His attempts however have not been unnoticed by those who pay attention to the romanov bloodline, and now the Grand Duke might just prove to be a worthy candidate for the throne under Drozdovsky."

While many predicted had predicted debating, there has been shockingly little debate. The reason for this, it seems, is that most within the assembly are awaiting for Marshal Drozdovsky to make his own choice.\n\nAfter a long period of silence, the Marshal produced from his coat a pen, with which he wrote a single word on a piece of paper, which he handed to  Patriarch Kirill who had been presiding over the Zemsky Sobor. The Patriarch, speaking for the whole assembly, then rose and proclaimed; 'We, the gathered members of the Zemsky Sobor, do hereby proclaim the election of a new Tsar! May God guide his hand, protect his soul and bring him a long love! With one accord, we proclaim...       "

russia.36589.d:0 "It was a cold day in Petrograd, I was going for a daytime stroll as I existed the Duma building. From the crowd emerged a shadowy figure who, before the police could do anything, discharged a gun. I saw my entire life flash before my eyes, from my birth to my childhood, to the Revolution, all the way until the very second where I was shot. It all went blank, until I woke up in my bed the next day. I assumed it was all a dream, just a bad dream, surely my guards wouldn’t allow my assassination?\n\nBut as I exited the Duma, I saw the same gunman approach, and the same bullet fly towards my head, but as soon as the bullet pierced my skull, and ass soon as my brains splattered all over the Duma’s walls, I awoke in my bed the very next morning. It kept going on like this, on and on, for what felt like an eternity\n\nEvery day as I awoke I saw the world change around me, familiars faces changing, the world becoming a little different every time I awoke. The first day I was trapped in this loop, Italy was divided into two pieces, eventually I came to find that it was divided into five, a few years later it was back to two pieces. I liked it better when it was in 5 pieces. I found out who that hooded gunman was, it was one of Savinkov’s insane lackeys, Pavel Gorgulov. But even as I find out more and more of the world I live in, I could never seem to avoid the tragic events of my death.\n\nMy assassination seemed to be the only constant left in the world, until the one day where I defied my set-in stone fate. As I saw Gorgulov approach, I stood unflinching, I knew the bullet would reset this loop at any second; I had just grown used to that. But as the gun fired, I took a deep breath, and ran like hell towards my eternal assassin. With all my might I tackled Gorguov, even as he feebly tried to shoot me again and again; the bullets simply glanced off of me. With the combined rage I had build up over the countless years stuck in this time loop hell, I thrust my hand into Pavel Gorgulov’s chest, and pulled out his still-beating heart. As I saw his life force fade, I grimaced. I had finally done it, I had broken the loop, I had finally survived.\n\nThat was almost 500 years ago, and I have ruled Russia as their Eternal President ever since. I have seen nations crumble, men die, systems fall, but in all of this, in all of the chaotic uncertainty of the world, I, President Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky remain as the one, true unflinching constant in this dark and dreary world.

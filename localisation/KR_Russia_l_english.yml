RUS_totalist_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya\n§LRussian Communist Party§!\n§gThe Russian Communist Party emerged from a left-wing group of Bolsheviks, that were against Bukharin. The RKP, led by Zinoviev, supports orthodox Marxism-Leninism, collectivisation, rapid industrialisation and is strongly opposed to Bukharin's market socialism. The RKP is banned in Russia, but they still retain a solid following. They may see an opportunity to take power if the situation in the country radically changes.§!"
RUS_syndicalist_party_long: "Partiya Levykh Sotsialistov-revolyutsionerov\n§LParty of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries§!\n§gThe Party of the Left Socialists-Revolutionaries (PLSR) has traversed a tumultuous path since its inception as an ally of the Bolsheviks during the revolution. Though its fortunes waned after the civil war, the PLSR's resilience and commitment to their ideals enabled their survival and resurgence. Following their shift from Bolshevik allies to adversaries, the PLSR faced political isolation and a loss of support. However, they managed to avoid bans and arrests that affected other groups. This allowed them to persist and eventually regain their footing in the Russian political landscape. A notable transformation occurred within the PLSR, as Steinberg's anarcho-syndicalist economic-political doctrine gained prominence. This ideology bordered on anarchism and libertarian socialism, emphasizing workers' self-governance through syndicates and soviets. This shift towards extreme leftist ideals showcased the party's commitment to the empowerment of the working class. Amidst the social upheaval that gripped Russia, the PLSR seized the opportunity to regain momentum. Spiridonova and the Left SRs emerged as leaders in strikes and peasant uprisings, appealing to the left-wing radical electorate. Spiridonova's image as a revolutionary symbol further boosted their standing, culminating in a government ban on Left SR activities in 1928.§!"
RUS_radical_socialist_party_long: "Narodnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya\n§LPeople's Socialist Party§!\n§gPreviously known by many other names, such as the \"Workers' Party\" or the \"Left Trade Unions\", the People's Socialist Party is just one of the names of the bloc of Moscow Bolsheviks, convicted and released in the early 1930s. Under the leadership of Nikolay Bukharin, Alexey Rykov and Lev Kamenev, the party broke with the Russian Communists of Zinoviev and his supporters on the issue of economic policy. The \"red star\" and the highlight of the NSP program is the so-called \"New Economic Policy\" - the coexistence of private property within the framework of Russia's gradual transition from a capitalist economy to socialism. The NEP describes a system entailing a coexistence of markets, private property, and a planned economy.§!"
RUS_social_democrat_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Rabochaya Partiya\n§LRussian Social Democratic Labour Party§!\n§gDuring the Constituent Assembly elections, the Mensheviks, led by Yuliy Martov, secured second place, positioning themselves as a key party advocating for the rights of the proletariat. Their absence paved the way for their prominence. Despite their socialist stance, the Mensheviks maintained cooperation with the government, and some of their reforms received approval from Kerensky. From the outset, the Mensheviks faced internal divisions. Martov led the faction of Internationalists, bolstered by the success of the French proletarian revolution. A more radical group of Lozovsky's Novozhiznentsy, which had briefly collaborated with the Bolsheviks, merged back into the Mensheviks. Conversely, a right-wing faction, led by Askelrod, and then - Potresov and Tsereteli, advocated for bourgeois-oriented reform and cooperation with liberal and Socialist-Revolutionary parties.§!"
RUS_social_liberal_party_long: "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov\n§LParty of Socialists-Revolutionaries§!\n§gThe Socialist-Revolutionary Party (PSR) has held the reins of power for the past 15 years, but its leadership and policies have been marked by internal divisions and external challenges. Despite being in power, the PSR's program was often deemed too radical by President Kerensky, who maintained his nominal membership in the party. Viktor Chernov, the PSR leader, held significant positions but remained in the shadows. His focus was more on promoting Socialist-Revolutionary reforms and aligning with the Mensheviks rather than the Kadets. The 1932 elections marked a turning point for the PSR. They lost the Duma elections to the NRPR, and only a coalition with the Kadets prevented a complete defeat. Fearing the activities of Savinkov and the NRPR, Kerensky tightened legislation against opposition parties and assemblies, leading to heightened security measures. By 1936, attempts on high-ranking officials, including Kerensky, escalated. Despite this environment, factions within the PSR remain divided on the party's future. Some advocate for cooperation with the Kadets, while others lean towards Savinkov and his right-wing orientation. The PSR faces complex choices in navigating these internal and external dynamics.§!"
RUS_market_liberal_party_long: "Konstitutsionno-Demokraticheskaya Partiya\n§LConstitutional Democratic Party§!\n§gThe Party of Constitutional Democrats (Kadets) has been an enduring presence in Russia's political landscape, drawing support from a diverse spectrum of liberal-minded individuals. From landowners and industrialists to merchants, bankers, teachers, doctors, employees, and intellectuals, the Kadets' constituency represents a broad cross-section of society. Emerging as the sole major non-socialist entity, the party secured a third-place position in the Constituent Assembly elections, asserting itself as a pivotal force in shaping Russia's future.§!"
RUS_social_conservative_party_long: "Vserossiysky Natsionalniy Soyuz\n§LAll-Russian National Union§!\n§gThe All-Russian National Union (VNS) is a paramount conservative political party in Russia, serving as a unifying force for various nobles, landlords, and constitutional monarchists. Originally established in 1908, the party brought together different conservative factions and organizations across the nation. Following the turmoil of the Civil War, the VNS was reconstituted in 1922 in direct opposition to the republican governance that had emerged. Led by Vasily Shulgin, the party's primary aim is to restore constitutional monarchy in Russia, reverse federalization policies, and reassert the primacy of Russians as the core nationality in the country. Vasily Shulgin's leadership within the VNS signifies a fervent commitment to the reinstatement of a constitutional monarchy in Russia. Championing a progressive interpretation of nationalism, Shulgin envisions a monarchy rooted in democratic principles, striving to initiate a referendum to determine the future monarch. His vision extends beyond mere restoration, aiming to reformulate the monarchy's role in a rapidly evolving society. By prioritizing the unity of the nation and embracing a more inclusive approach, Shulgin's faction seeks to merge historical values with contemporary governance, ensuring that the monarchy serves as a symbol of national cohesion.§!"
RUS_authoritarian_democrat_party_long: "Vserossiysky Natsionalniy Soyuz\n§LAll-Russian National Union§!\n§gThe All-Russian National Union (VNS) is a paramount conservative political party in Russia, serving as a unifying force for various nobles, landlords, and constitutional monarchists. Originally established in 1908, the party brought together different conservative factions and organizations across the nation. Following the turmoil of the Civil War, the VNS was reconstituted in 1922 in direct opposition to the republican governance that had emerged. Dmitry Romanov and Felix Yusupov spearhead a faction within the VNS that embraces a diverse range of political and economic objectives. While retaining loyalty to the idea of constitutional monarchy, Romanov and Yusupov prioritize personal and economic influence within the government. Romanov, who holds legitimate claims to the throne, exhibits aspirations for an aristocratic republic founded on a strong authoritarian rule. This faction also features Yusupov's influential perspective, advocating for a future centered around oligarchy and substantial capital influence. United by their ambitions, they seek to consolidate power within their ranks and navigate the intricacies of Russia's evolving political landscape.§!"
RUS_paternal_autocrat_party_long: "Rossiysky Obshche-Voinsky Soyuz\n§LRussian All-Military Union§!\n§gThe Russian All-Military Union is an organization created by Russian General Lavr Kornilov. It seek to unite all White Army generals that were opposed to Bolsheviks during the civil war. The ROVS believes that socialism is a curse, and that Russia should be led by a strong ruler, willing to unite and stabilize the fractured country by any means necessary.§!"
RUS_national_populist_party_long: "Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii\n§LPeople's Republican Party of Russia§!\n§gThe NRPR stands as a synthesis of diverse ideological currents that have found resonance within Boris Savinkov. This intricate blend entails an authoritarian and all-encompassing system of governance, underscored by a fervent belief in Agrarian Socialist Neo-Narodnichestvo. The party also champions the cause of Revolutionary Christianity, serving as a form of apocalyptic rebirth for leading to the creation of a Third Russia. At the helm of the NRPR stands Boris Savinkov, a former SR member and a figure known for his terrorist past and resolute ideals. Savinkov's leadership is marked by a fervent dedication to his vision, driven by the belief in the righteousness of his cause. As uncertain future looms, the 'Vozhd,' has succeeded in galvanizing a broad spectrum of the revolutionary and protest-oriented electorate. With a distinctive blend of agrarian socialism, authoritarianism, and a promise of rebirth, the NRPR has positioned itself as a formidable contender. While the path to victory may not be without challenges, the party's increasing influence suggests that it may yet shape the future of Russia.§!"

RUS_eurasianist_party: "YeP"
RUS_eurasianist_party_long: "Yevraziyskaya Partiya\n§LEurasianist Party§!\n§gThe Eurasianist Party (YeP) emerged in 1922 with the publication of "Exodus to the East. Premonitions and Achievements. The Approval of the Eurasianists," authored by prominent intellectuals like Nikolay Trubetskoy, Pyotr Savitsky, and Georgy Florovsky. The party gained traction quickly, establishing its own publishing house, attracting notable figures such as G. V. Vernadsky, R. O. Yakobson, L. P. Karsavin, and even composer Stravinsky by 1925. By 1925, the Eurasianists entered politics, forming a party and gaining several mandates in the early Senate elections. Their popularity surged, partially fueled by anti-German sentiments and the appeal of their "rejecting Europe" concept, resonating particularly among right-wing and conservative-leaning groups. This resonance effectively diverted much of the Republican electorate from other parties. As the party grew, ideological divisions started to emerge. While the "Center" represented by Trubetskoy, Savitsky, and Vernadsky maintained their influence, ideological leaning towards the left, represented by figures like Mirsky, brought Narodism into the equation. A subtle right bias was also present, with the national-maximalist faction of Prince Shikhmatov-Shirinsky, leaning toward nationalism and allying with Boris Savinkov. The Central Committee further demonstrated diverse perspectives. Jacobson advocated for social-democratic ideas within Eurasianism, Tyrkova-Williams pushed for liberalization of the regime and broader access to Eurasianism, and Chkheidze supported the idea of a Eurasianist monarchy.§!"

RUS_mensheviks_party: "RSDRP"
RUS_mensheviks_party_long: "Rossiyskaya Sotsial-Demokraticheskaya Rabochaya Partiya\n§gThe Russian Social Democratic Labour Party is one of the major socialist parties represented in the Russian Parliament. Led by Irakliy Tsereteli, so-called Mensheviks admire Western democratic socialism and hope for a peaceful and legal path to socialist reform in Russia.§!"

RUS_social_rev_party: "PSR"
RUS_social_rev_party_long: "Partiya Sotsialistov-Revolyutsionerov\n§gThe Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries has been the dominant party in Russia for the last 20 years. The party has existed in a coalition with the Kadets under the leadership of President Kerensky, but almost none of the SR's reforms were made. Victor Chernov, leader of the SRs, believes that agrarian socialism is the best path to appease various socialist groups in Russia, but it is unlikely that he can revamp the economic system without the help of other parties.§!"

RUS_tsar_party: "RMS"
RUS_tsar_party_long: "Russkyi Monarchicheskyi Soyuz\n§gThe Russian Monarchist Union is organization, representing monarchists in Russia that support a Tsarist autocracy.§!"

RUS_chernosot_party_long: "Russky Narodniy Soyuz imeni Mikhaila Arkhangela\n§gThe Russian People's Union of Archangel Michael is a conservative national-legionary monarchist organization led by Vladimir Purishkevich. It supports Tsarist autocracy and a radical policy detailing widespread persecution of the country’s Jewish minority.§!"

RUS_solidarist_party: "NSNP"
RUS_solidarist_party_long: "Natsionalniy Soyuz Novogo Pokoleniya\n§LNational Union of New Generation§!\n§gThe National Union of the New Generation (NSNP) stands as a distinctive political entity born out of the "National Union of Russian Youth" in 1930. With the establishment of its Central Committee and adoption of a defining party charter, the NSNP set itself apart by implementing an age limit, welcoming only those born after 1895. This threshold was introduced to guard against the perceived \"sins and prejudices of the past,\" distancing the party from the influence of figures deemed partly responsible for historic tragedies. The NSNP's ideological foundation germinated amid the aftermath of the Civil War, marked by vehement anti-socialist sentiment and Kerensky's failed reforms. Counter to general strife, the NSNP's youthful adherents championed the principles of solidarity and societal unity.§!"

RUS_gorgulov_party: "VNKPZ"
RUS_gorgulov_party_long: "Vserossiyskaya Narodnaya Krestyanskaya Partiya Zelyonikh\n§LThe All-Russian People's Peasant Party of the Greens§!\n\n§gThe VNKPZ was once an independent party before it merged into the NRPR to become its right wing faction. Since the end of the Civil War, Pavel Gorgulov decided to support those who fought against Bolshevism and who were disappointed with the current government. After the death of Boris Savinkov, Pavel Gorgulov reorganized the NRPR into the VNKPZ. The party denounces common moral values, seeking to create a 'Scythian' totalitarian ethnostate of Russian peasants and Green Army Legionnaries.§!"

RUS_abakumov_party: "NRPR-MVD"
RUS_abakumov_party_long: "Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii - Ministerstvo Vnutrennih Del\n§LPeople's Republican Party of Russia - Ministry of Internal Affairs§!\n§gIn the wake of Boris Savinkov's death and the chaos that followed multiple factions emerged to try and claim the mantle of the Vozhd. Among them was the Ministry of State Security headed by Viktor Semyonovich Abakumov, Savinkov's trusted chief of security and one the man responsible for NRPR's policies towards subversive elements. Due to his own power base and the backing of other 'Siloviki' within the ministries, such as the MVD, now merged with the MGB to create one over-agency, Abakumov stood triumphant after the chaos dissipated. Now in charge of not only the ruling party, but also the entire national state security, Vozhd Abakumov aims to transform Russia into a Republic of the Strongmen, with unlimited extent of state reach into every aspect of life and broad continuation of Savinkovist policies, albeit with noticeable turn away from 'socialism' and towards state-oligarchic capitalism.§!"

Emerging as the sole major non-socialist entity, the party secured a third-place position in the Constituent Assembly elections, asserting itself as a pivotal force in shaping Russia's future. As historical and tactical issues emerged after the Constituent Assembly, the Kadets experienced shifts in their internal dynamics. The victory of Milyukov's centrists prevailed in a contest of various currents, consolidating their hold. However, the subsequent years saw the rise of internal challenges and divisions. The left wing, spearheaded by Nekrasov, advocated for a revival of the revolutionary coalition, seeking ties with parties like the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks. This coalition-oriented approach aimed to bolster the power of the Duma, marking a significant departure from the party's early days.§!"

Nabokov's commitment to alliances with conservative factions shaped this wing's aspirations.

rus_industry_lack_desc: "Kerensky's inability to carry out land reform led to the fact that entire regions of the country lost effective ways of industrialization. Moreover, after the Civil War, Russia faced economic ruin, a short period of growth, and then a recession due to stagnation and corruption caused by Kerensky's ineffective rule. Now Russia is still behind industrially compared to Western Europe and the United States.\n§W--------------\nPolitical Power Gain: [?ROOT.RUS_backward_industry_political_power_gain|=%+0]\n£prod_eff  Production Efficiency growth: [?ROOT.RUS_backward_industry_efficiency_gain|=%+0]\n£prod_eff_cap  Production Efficiency Cap: [?ROOT.RUS_backward_industry_max_efficiency|=%+0]\nFactory Output: [?ROOT.RUS_backward_industry_industrial_capacity|=%+0]\nConstruction Speed: [?ROOT.RUS_backward_industry_production_speed_buildings|=%+0]\nResearch Speed: [?ROOT.RUS_backward_industry_research_speed|=%+0]\nMonthly Industrialisation Rate: [?ROOT.RUS_backward_industry_industrialisation_rate|=%+2]"

rus_unfinished_land_reform_desc: "The land was once nationalized by the Bolsheviks in the first days of the 1917 October Putsch, as well as private property abolished. However, with the White forces eventually defeating the Bolsheviks, the private property was reestablished on all Russian territory. Kerensky, while technically being a member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, understood the importance of the land question. In order to please the peasants and socialist supporters and voters, he passed the Land Socialization Bill, which originally should have abolished any private property considering land ownership. However, in order to appease the other side of the political spectrum, the liberals and conservatives, the Bill was adopted with some adjustments: while land in the most fertile lands was in a public ownership of special agricultural councils, private property over land was still legal in other areas of Russia. This, however, still led to various problems, including rising support for more radical parties in the country, rough going industrialization and difficulties with building new infrastructure. The Land Reform is still unfinished and it must be solved once and for all as soon as possible."

### Leaders ###

POLITICS_GORGULOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! June 29th, 1895, in Labinskaya Stanitsa, Kuban Oblast, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! A Kuban Cossack writer and political ideologue, Pavel Gorgulov, otherwise known infamously as 'The Green Vozhd', became widely known for murdering Russian ex-president, Alexander Kerensky. During the Civil War, Pavel Gorgulov was engaged in subversive anti-bolshevik actions and got acquinted with Boris Savinkov. Gorgulov's views were influenced by Russian avant-garde poetic movements, such as New Peasant Poets, Imaginists and late Symbolists. Though his view became highly esoteric and even his subordinates aren't sure whether he is...sane. His emphasis on the peasantry culminates in his messianic belief that "wild, primitive, and Scythian" Russian civilization will prevail over Western civilization and establish a new order across the world.\n\nAfter Savinkov's takeover of Russia, Pavel Gorgulov was pardoned and subsequently released from jail. However, with the help of the Green Army, Pavel Gorgulov managed to overthrow Savinkov and install his own dictatorship. He will try to transform Russia into one of his dreams - a radically nationalist peasant agrarian state." 
POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 31st, 1879, in Kharkov, Kharkov Gubernia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! A terrorist, a revolutionary and a dictator is just a few of many labels given to Boris Savinkov, the leader of the People's Republican Party of Russia. Throughout his colorful life, he has assassinated and bombed many as a part of the Combat Organization of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, before moving on to becoming a pragmatic schemer behind Alexander Kerensky's back - as Assistant War Minister in 1917, he nearly assumed dictatorial power in Russia from the shadows, and only the collapse of the Kornilov coup led to his downfall. However, he rehabilitated himself by organizing the Union for the Defense of the Motherland, an underground resistance organization in Moscow which prepared the soil for the city's fall in 1919.\n\nSavinkov may have once been a socialist, but he has long since abandoned the weak Socialist Revolutionaries in favor of a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced him over the years - all of which merge into a system of dictatorial rule, Agrarian Socialist policy, and Revolutionary Apocalyptic Christianity. Like an eagle rising from the ashes, the Vozhd shall restore the glory of the Russian state and transform it into a hegemon of reaction." 
POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_BIO: "Born to a Russian father and Polish mother, Anton Denikin chose to embrace the patriotism of the former, and tied the rest of his life with the Imperial Russian Army. By the Great War, he was a major general and a chief of staff in Kiev Military District, and a prolific writer who analysed the shortcomings of the Russian army. A second in command to Lavr Kornilov, he escaped to Southern Russia alongside him and helped form the Volunteer Army which would ultimately put an end to the Bolshevik revolution. It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment. Politics are the last thing on his mind, but should he end up in power one way or another, Denikin's experience in the Russian chief of staff will lead to him commanding the nation like he used to command his regiment."

Alexandr Fyodorovich Kerensky, born 1881 is the second President of the Russian Democratic Federative Republic so far. To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Alexander Kerensky, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerensky sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks.\n\nKerensky returned to power in 1924, as the appointed President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerensky marks his twelfth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerensky established land reform, though never fully finishing it, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the new economic program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerensky has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition.\nIn case of trouble, unknown forces could attempt to remove Kerensky from power and seize control of Russia."

Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, now Kirill I of Russia, is one of the most troublesome members of the House of Romanov. Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication.\n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. While Kirill accepts his role as the restored Russian monarch, it truly doesn't matter to him whether Russia is constitutional or authoritarian - as long as he is the one in charge."

Vladimir III Romanov is the new Tsar of the restored Russian Empire, being an heir to the throne ever since his father claimed it. He is a different man from his father and many other members of his dynasty - a young man who has never even seen Nikolay II or the former Russian Empire, and thus only knows it from stories and history books. Educated in Canada and having received a course in military affairs in Russia, Vladimir gives off the aura of an erudite and an intellectual. He speaks several languages - English, French, Spanish and German - besides his native Russian, he shows competence in diplomatic affairs and domestic issues alike. Assuming the throne at such a young age has had a toll on him and the first few years of his reign were bound to be awkward, but the Russian aristocracy and populace have great hopes in the young Tsar.

Since his childhood, he has been seen as the forefront of a new generation of royals, unlike, say, the ageing Grand Duke Kirill — he is an avid sportsman and ambitious adventurer integrated into modern Western society. Through his friendship with Prince Feliks Yusupov, he is said to have participated in the assassination of Grigory Rasputin and was banished to Persia as a result — thanks to this, however, he survived the Russian Revolution and escaped to Western Europe. After an affair with Coco Chanel and Audrey Emery, Dmitry returned to Russia, and accepted the new Republican order — at least in the open.\n\nA coalition of monarchists and moderate right wing republicans have assembled behind Dmitry, seeing a saviour in his persona. Those afraid of Kirill's character believe that the \"Modern Romanov\" would make for a great constitutional monarch, whereas aristocratic republicans see a strong and charismatic persona which could unite the left and the right.

A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakliy Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognize the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDRP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDRP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."

Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasiliy Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1924, Chernov and Kerensky formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last twelve years. While Kerensky was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."

Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerensky's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Alexander Kerensky. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."

A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Eurasianist Party", a conservative party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pyotr Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Aleksander Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik. \n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. Following the suppression of the revolution, Nikolay Bukharin, like other Bolshevik leaders in Moscow, was detained by the White Army and sentenced to lengthy imprisonment. However, upon receiving an amnesty from Kerensky, he, along with fellow leftists, actively resumed his political activities. Bukharin recognized bureaucratization within the party and \"military-feudal exploitation\" in the countryside as the primary causes of Bolshevism's failure. He proposed a moderate approach characterized by cautious industrialization, fostering unity between the proletariat and peasantry, and incorporating elements of market economics as interim measures prior to achieving genuine world communism."

Vladimir Purishkevich was born to an impoverished noble family. Despite his beginnings, he was able to earn a degree in classics, and his interest in politics only grew from there. In 1905, during the Russian Revolution, he was one of the principal founders of the powerful Black Hundredist movement. At the time, the movement suffered from crippling infighting, and Puriskevich himself had several rivals in the organization. Puriskevich had a role in the 1916 killing of Grigori Rasputin, believing his influence on the Tsarina and the country as a whole to be too dangerous to ignore. He developed many of his strongly anti-semitic, nationalist, and monarchist views during the Russian Civil War, in which he came to believe in an open fight against Jewry. \n\nWhen the Civil War ended, Puriskevich was not idle. His restlessness and charisma were powerful tools that he used to great success in propelling the RNSMA to national status, but they remained a fringe organization due to the existence of the republic. Now that they are in power, this situation has changed. Though he is old, Puriskevich will not squander the opportunity he has been waiting for for decades. His plans to restore the Russian Empire to greatness as one nation under one tsar will not be stopped by any means, and he will see to it that Russia is no longer the laughing stock of the world."

In the early 1890s Potresov participated in the work of the social-democratic circles of P. B. Struve and Y. O. Martov, and in 1903 he became one of the organizers and leaders of the Menshevik Party.  In the following months, Potresov did a lot of work to inform European Social democracy about the ideological origins of the split of the RSDRP. Largely due to his activities, such prominent socialists as K. Kautsky and R.

In May 1917, Potresov returned to Petrograd. Remaining the leader of the Menshevik Defencists, he defended the coalition Provisional Government, defending the idea of uniting the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the name of national unity and the triumph of statehood. Potresov categorically did not accept the October Revolution. He assessed it as 'the murder of democracy', and the political situation that developed after it as 'socialism of fools'.\n\nThe Extraordinary Congress of the RSDRP(o), held in November-December 1917, was dominated by sentiments with which Potresov categorically disagreed. He, along with his supporters, refused to participate in the elections of the Central Committee of the RSDRP(o). Potresov planned to formally withdraw from the party by the autumn of 1918, but his plans were hindered by the murder of Lenin and the transfer of the initiative to the hands of the white forces, and was perceived by Potresov as an opportunity to unite the Social Democrats around the Mensheviks.\n\nHis predictions about the mass transition of the workers' movement after the defeat of the Bolsheviks and the Left SRs were justified, and as a result, the Mensheviks took second place in the elections to the new constituent Assembly, but the internationalist Martov dominated the party. The split of the Mensheviks into leftists-internationalists, and right-wing moderates was obvious. In 1928, Potresov became the leader of the Menshevik Party, and already quite elderly, he now became the president of the republic - doing everything possible for the triumph of social democracy."

He joined the Red Army as a volunteer and rapidly rose in rank, becoming a close associate to Leon Trotsky and achieving the rank of General not long after Lenin's assassination. The Fifth Army he commanded was one of the Red Army's finest units and pioneered the concept of motorized concentration warfare, but was ultimately defeated by Vladimir Kappel.\n\nAlongside several high ranking Bolsheviks and Red Army leaders, Tukhahevsky escaped to France, a nation he was already familiar with, and offered his service to the newly established Commune. In the following years, he dedicated his time to essay after essay on the reforms which he believed the French army needs - his close associates said that he owns over a hundred volumes on military tactics and has read every single one. Tukhachevsky expressed dismay at the decentralized, Syndicalist structure of the Commune, believing it unfit for modern warfare, and proposed the creation of a unified, centralized, apolitical army. Because of this, he came into constant conflict with the Faure government, but the CGT could not simply remove him from the academy - even they understood that Tukhachevsky was the best general which the Internationale has available.\n\nTo resolve this, he and the other Bolsheviks were sent to Patagonia to lead a military mission to help the Argentinean Revolution."

In his lectures and articles, he called for the total destruction of the 'old bourgeois culture' in favour of a 'pure proletarian culture' of the future.\n\nAfter the end of the civil war, like many Bolsheviks, he went to the Commune, where, together with Lunacharsky, he continued the activities of the Proletkult abroad and achieved significant success in promoting proletarian culture in France.\n\nBogdanov was educated in medicine and psychiatry. His broad scientific and medical interests ranged from the theory of universal systems even to the possibility of human rejuvenation through blood transfusions. He invented an original philosophy called 'tectology'. He was also an economist, cultural theorist, science fiction writer, and political activist.\n\nOn his return to Russia, he joined Lunacharsky's Proletkultists faction and became a minister in his government. However, now that he was his successor and became the head of the government, most likely he will want to implement all his concepts, even the most esoteric."
POLITICS_VALERIAN_POLYANSKY_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! January 2nd, 1882, in Melenki, Vladimir Gubernia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Valerian Polyansky (real name Pavel Lebedev-Polyansky) - one of the Bolshevik activists since 1903, an active participant in the 1905 revolution. In 1907, he met Lenin, Bogdanov, and Lunacharsky, and later became secretary of the Marxist Forward group founded by Lunacharsky and Bogdanov.\n\nAfter the October Revolution, he was appointed Commissar of the Literary Publishing Department of the People's Commissariat of Education and became Chairman of the All-Russian Council of the Proletkult. In 1918-1936, he was the editor-in-chief of the Proletarian Culture publishing house. His views on art were formed under the influence of A. A. Bogdanov. Polyansky believed that art is 'an educational tool', 'an instrument of social organization of people'. Literature, according to Polyansky, 'directly and indirectly is a means of organization', and ' every literary and artistic work, not excluding works of 'pure art', solves some organizational task, sometimes personal, sometimes broadly social'.\nIn an era when the proletariat has become the leading class,  'organizational class', and when 'our epoch is exclusively organizational, all life is being rebuilt on completely new principles', the artist must 'take the necessary material and process it without diverging from the requirements of the time'. He argued that the proletariat needed collectivist art.\n\nAfter Lunacharsky became chairman of the party, Polyansky was appointed chairman of the Glavlit and became the creator of the so-called Soviet censorship. He claimed that censorship protects the dictatorship of the proletariat and is guided by 'party directives'.\n\nAfter the sudden death of Bogdanov, Polyansky was elected the new chairman of the People's Commissariat of Education and the Party. Perhaps, under him, the country will completely center itself and get rid of dissent."
POLITICS_NIKOLAY_KRESTINSKY_DESC: "§YLeader Description\nBorn:§! October 25th, 1883, in Mogilyov, Mogilyov Gubernia, Russian Empire\n§YPolitical Career:§! Nikolai Krestinsky, a member of the RSDLP since 1903, has a long history as a Bolshevik. In 1908-1914, he was a legal adviser to a number of trade unions and social-democratic factions in the III and IV State Duma. After the February Revolution of 1917, he was elected chairman of the Ekaterinburg provincial committee of the RSDRP(b) and found himself in opposition to the \"right-wing\" course pursued by Kamenev, but at the March meeting he remained in the minority. In April 1917, Krestinsky, together with Sverdlov, prepared and held the First Urals Social Democratic Conference in Yekaterinburg. In a passionate speech at it, Krestinsky made a worthy denunciation of the \"defenseists\", declaring, \"We will oppose the bourgeois government and wrest power from its hands in order to hand it over to the proletariat and the peasantry.\" His effectiveness in Yekaterinburg is evidenced by the fact that the local Soviet was the first in Russia to become fully Bolshevist in composition and in June 1917 to take power into its own hands.\n\nIn the days of the October Revolution, he was chairman of the Ekaterinburg VRK. He was elected a deputy of the Constituent Assembly. From December 1917, he was a member of the board of the People's Commissariat of Finance of the RSFSR, the Chief Commissar, Deputy Chairman of the People's Bank, Commissar of Justice of the Petrograd Labor Commune and the Union of Commune of the Northern Region.\n\nIn emigration, Krestinsky became a member of the Jacobin party, although he clearly understood that his homeland was not ready to join the internationalist proletarian movement until a real working class was created and developed. He abhorred syndicalism, considering it a revisionism of Marx's ideas and began to consider Zinoviev their pawn. Krestinsky planned that a closed system would be implemented in Soviet Russia, outside cooperation with the International. Now that he was head of state, he would do everything to build a just and equitable society, the main principle of which he proclaimed was to build "socialism in one country," and only then to build socialism in all others."

Georgy Ivanovich Blagonravov was born in 1896 in Yegoryevsk. He graduated from the Yegoryevskaya Gymnasium in 1914, and entered Moscow University in the same year, where as a student at the Faculty of Law of Moscow University, he joined the revolutionary movement.\n\nIn May 1915, he was drafted into the Russian Imperial Army. After graduating from the Alexander Military School with the rank of ensign, he served in the 80th reserve Infantry Regiment in Yegoryevsk. In February 1917, he was elected chairman of the regimental committee, and in March joined the RSDRP(b), then became chairman of the Yegoryevsky Council of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies.\n\nAt the 1st All-Russian Congress of Soviets, he was elected a member of the Central Executive Committee, where he worked as a secretary of the Bolshevik faction. He was a member of the Combat Organization of the RSDRP(b). He took an active part in the October armed uprising in Petrograd. On October 23, Blagonravov was appointed by the Petrograd VRK Commissar of the Peter and Paul Fortress, whose guns fired on the Winter Palace on October 25. Blagonravov prepared cells in the Trubetskoy Bastion for the arrested ministers of the Provisional Government. Since December 1917, he worked as an extraordinary commissioner for the protection of Petrograd. Until May 1918 he served as the Extraordinary Commissioner of the protection of Petrograd. From November 1918 he worked in the organs of the Cheka in various positions related to railway transport.\n\nBlagonravov became one of the closest associates of Zinoviev in Petrograd and joined him in exile.After Dzerzhinsky and Menzhinsky finally focused all their attention on Poland, where they hoped to stage a coup and left the Cheka, citing the impossibility of a second revolution in Russia in the near future, Blagonravov was appointed head of the Cheka and the main contender for the post of People's Commissar of Internal Affairs in the event of a seizure of power by Zinoviev.\n\nMostly sharing the same ideals as Zinoviev, Blagonravov understands the true possibilities of terror and is likely to use them against traitors. So that the Revolution will be saved."
POLITICS_DROZDOVSKY_DESC: "Unlike a number of other major leaders of the White Movement, Mikhail Gordeevich should be considered the standard of the White General, the spokesman for the monarchist part of the White Guard movement, in essence, the only one fully true to its mission - "the war against the evil of the revolution in the deepest sense, implying also the February traitors."Loyal to the throne and oath, Drozdovsky formed around himself a circle of "knighted" monarchists, "the secret order of the general."\n\nHis own regiment was considered not only the military elite of the White Guard, but also the ideological one, which consisted almost entirely of supporters of traditional, imperial Russia. Mikhail Gordeevich Drozdovsky, with a volunteer detachment of 1000 people, marched 1,700 km from Yassy to Rostov, freed him from the Bolsheviks, then helped the Cossacks to defend Novocherkassk. Drozdovsky's regiment took part in the liberation of the Kuban and the North Caucasus. Drozdovsky was called the crusader of the crucified Motherland. Nervous, thin, Colonel Drozdovsky was a type of ascetic warrior: he did not drink, did not smoke and did not pay attention to the blessings of life; always - from Yassy until now - in the same shabby jacket, with a worn St. George's ribbon in his buttonhole. Now Drozdovsky is in head of leading Russia to its Glory and Holiness, and he's determined to not to stop in fron of any obstacle that may be in his way, after all, he himself say that:\n\n“Only courage and strong will do great things. Only an unshakable decision gives success and victory ”"

President Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky, the hero that freed us from the shackles of the Tsardom and ultimately brought the mad civil war to a close, is nearly dead. The Russian people can now only await if the head of state awakens from his coma, or drifts off into the eternal void, dragging everything else down into the darkest pits of hell."

RUS_Reintroduce_Okhranka_desc: "With revolutionary movements active throughout Russia, some members of the Duma are suggesting a complete reorganisation of the internal police on the basis of the old Tsarist secret police, 'Okhrannoye Otdeleniye'.

The Duma is in chaos, the Senate is paralyzed, the people are rioting, and the President is still in slumber of the post-assassination coma. If we do not act in the coming days it may finally signal to the sinister forces behind the tragic attempt that the Federative Republic is over, and the time to overthrow the old world is upon them."

RUS_Persecute_Bolsheviks_desc: "No matter what side of the political spectrum they fall on, radicals have always tried to undermine my presidency.

RUS_Empower_Senate_desc: "After I have reached an agreement with the formerly monarchist Conservatives of the VNS one thing became clear, the Senators will be a vital ally in the road that Russia shall find itself on. The Duma's hold over the daily operations of the state is at an end, for it is now the Senate that shall play the crucial part in my administration."

RUS_Martial_Law: "Martial Law"
RUS_Martial_Law_desc: "Thanks to the support of Lavr Kornilov and his ROVS organization, the streets of our Motherland will soon be secured. A martial law will take effect, placing the ultimate authority over the armed forces away from the hands of unproven generals and into the newly-founded emergency staff headed by me and the friendly marshals."

RUS_Soc_Lib_Dictator_desc: "There are nations which cannot be brought to modernity without kicking and screaming along the way, without the reactionary forces needing to be put down by methods we all would wish to put aside and forget. Just like Pyotr Velikiy before me, so too shall I, Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky, bring my Motherland into the light that shines in the darkness, illuminating and dispelling the structures of old. A new era is upon Russia, an age of Republican Samoderzhaviye."


RUS_Arrest_Bukharin: "Arrest Bukharin"
RUS_Arrest_Bukharin_desc: "Despite his best attempt to fool the general public by promoting an idea of 'New Economic Policy', Nikolay Bukhairn will always remain a blood-thirsty Leninist at heart. No matter how much the deluded Centre-Left element of my party may have thought, there is no place for cooperation with the leader of the People's Socialists, he must be put down."

RUS_Committee: "Komitet Spaseniya Respubliki"
RUS_Committee_desc: "With clear mind and regained senses, it is clear to see that the assassination attempt left weak not only me, but Russia itself too. To handle the danger of our nation collapsing into a backwards autocracy yet again, or worse, a civil war, the only solution left is to proclaim a decree announcing the creation of the Committee for the Salvation of the Republic."

RUS_I_Was_Never_A_Socialist: "I Was Never a Socialist"
RUS_I_Was_Never_A_Socialist_desc: "The obscenities hurled at me by my former allies do not concern me anymore, for what have the 'Centre-Left' SRs or the Mensheviks ever done for Russia beyond being a thorn in its side? They were only necessary to attain power in the era of the Tsars and the Bolsheviks, to combat their reaction and revolution. The Kadets, my dear collaborators, know exactly that my intentions were always to abandon the delusions of a 'Coming Paradise on Earth', of Socialism."

RUS_I_Was_Never_A_Liberal: "I Was Never a Liberal"
RUS_I_Was_Never_A_Liberal_desc: "My party is right, I have gone too far in appeasing the crypto-monarchists among the Constitutional Democrats. My goal in allying them was merely pragmatic, they were necessary to accumulate enough political capital to push forward the reforms that Russia desperately needed. But we shall listen to their drivel no more, Russia requires real reforms, real praxis. The American-esque mirage of reckless pursuit of profits shall never plague our nation."

RUS_Find_A_Compromise: "Find a Compromise"
RUS_Find_A_Compromise_desc: "Socialist, Liberal, Autocrat, Radical. Does it all even matter in the state we find ourselves in right now? Do the people of our Motherland care who works with whom to reach an agreement that can put an end to the raging flames? No, they do not. Thus, I have authorized my party to seek the widest united front possible in order to harness the power of the moderates against the terrorists on both wings."

RUS_Forge_A_New_Coalition: "Forge a New Coalition"
RUS_Forge_A_New_Coalition_desc: "It would be foolish to continue as a lone soul, a force without help in the landscape fraught with danger.

RUS_Appease_Duma: "Appease the Duma"
RUS_Appease_Duma_desc: "The Duma, for all its faults and the provincial simpletons filling its seats, is the institution common Russians came to see as most representative of their will. Thus, it cannot be removed or put down, for that would be a betrayal of the very people I have sworn to represent and protect. I will have to do much to make myself a persona non grata no longer in its chambers, but it will surely be worth it." 

RUS_Appease_Senate: "Appease the Senate"
RUS_Appease_Senate_desc: "The constant reliance on factions with ideological zeal unbefitting enlightened moderates has only resulted in the prolonged crisis of the Republic. I am left with no other choices but to turn my gaze towards the Senate, a chiefly Conservative institution that has proven itself to be a constant roadblock against changes they do not approve of. The people may complain, but the senators need to be consulted too."

RUS_Appease_Military: "Appease the General Staff"
RUS_Appease_Military_desc: "If not for my swift recovery, the situation in Russia could have devolved into utter chaos and barbarism, with the risk of a military coup ever-approaching and paralyzing the temporary cabinet. As much as general Kornilov could disagree with certain policies of the government, he has been a faithful ally in the struggle to secure Russia and his help would be much appreciated."

RUS_Secure_The_Coalition: "Secure the Coalition"
RUS_Secure_The_Coalition_desc: "Due to the recent reshuffling of my political allies, the SR dominated coalition has been left relatively weak compared to the uniform established parties. If there is to be any chance for the Republic to survive, it must be under an emboldened unity government. Let's do everything possible to ensure that the coalition will not shatter at the first sign of adversity."

RUS_Reform_Electoral_Law: "Reform Electoral Law"
RUS_Reform_Electoral_Law_desc: "In the coming years, Russia will not be able to survive as a democratic nation if we allow the same laws as are currently in effect to dictate who gets to 'represent' the people. The electoral reform must come into effect, with a few and necessary additions as suggested by the allies that have allowed my government to survive."

RUS_Eyes_To_The_Right: "Eyes to the Right"
RUS_Eyes_To_The_Right_desc: "As much as my republican nature may irritate and disagree with the monarchists in the VNS, it is more than obvious that any bill in the Senate will die without their approval. Perhaps the time of 'Liberalism' has passed over our Motherland and failed to make an impact, for the Conservatives are those who are most willing to work with me in preserving the nation."

RUS_Correct_Mistakes: "Correct Past Mistakes"
RUS_Correct_Mistakes_desc: "I have made mistakes in Russia, that is indeed true. However, many other people have also made mistakes that weigh down Russia to this day - mistakes far more egregious than any of my own. After this initial period of early stabilization, the time has finally come to correct them all, for I love my ailling people and they will come to love me too."

RUS_Russo_German_Relation: "Russo-Germanic Diplomatic Overtures"
RUS_Russo_German_Relation_desc: "While it is not a situation that we are entirely comfortable with, the Germans have won the Weltkrieg and thus earned the right to dominate Eastern Europe for the time being. Cutting off diplomatic channels with Berlin would accomplish nothing, which is why we should make an effort to secure a good rapport with them. Even a personal visit to the capital of the Reich by me could be in order."

RUS_Final_Land_Policy_Solution: "An Ultimate Resolution to the Land Issue"
RUS_Final_Land_Policy_Solution_desc: "The Land Question has been the bane of Russia ever since the dissolution of the Tsardom, for it was the incompetent rule of the Romanovs that left us with a situation that could only be patch-worked so far. While many of our citizens may have been upset that my government has done nothing concrete in terms of solving the problem, this shall change now. The land has to be clarified lest we want a grand peasant rising to topple our very existence."

RUS_Begin_Industrialisation: "Kickstart Industrialization"
RUS_Begin_Industrialisation_desc: "Owing to centuries of mismanagement and limited private ventures, the Russian urban centres have been left lacking when it comes to a proper factory sector. It is shameful that even in the early days of my political career the city of Łódź in Congress Poland was one of the only big industrial points across the Motherland, with the situation not changing much other than the resources of the West falling away from us. The time is finally upon us to change this sorry state of affairs and launch an ambitious industrialization programme."

RUS_Establish_Federal_Autonomies: "Towards Federalization?"
RUS_Establish_Federal_Autonomies_desc: "The Federative Republic, perhaps my greatest achievement, has been sadly burdened with a major mistake in its construction. The myriad of unique ethnicities and cultural groups of the former Empire that are still left within our borders are still not heard, their displeasure at not being properly autonomous yet is considerable. Perhaps it is finally time to transform Russia into an entity never before seen in this part of the world, a genuine federation."

RUS_Reinforce_Local_Parliament: "Reinforce Local Parliaments"
RUS_Reinforce_Local_Parliament_desc: "The devolved nature of the nation is a good idea on paper, but sadly it has not been properly implemented yet. Granting more powers to local assemblies will not only endear me to the locals, but also remove countless scheming bureaucrats from inside the centralized administration. The decrease in upkeep cost of the far-flung bureaus, of course, is simply a nice bonus."

RUS_Presidential_Government: "A Purely Presidential Government"
RUS_Presidential_Government_desc: "Parliamentary republics are something that could not be emulated in our lands, for the people of Russia have always excelled under the power of strong and dedicated rulers. While that, of course, doesn't mean a one-man rule, the government should be reshuffled to serve the needs of the man in charge, with loyal members carrying out their limited tasks."

RUS_Everything_Is_Under_Control: "Everything is Under Control"
RUS_Everything_Is_Under_Control_desc: "While many have doubted me or the methods that have been chosen along the way, the results speak for themselves. Russian can now enjoy a period of peace and stability that has not been seen in centuries, with any possible danger squashed by a resolute response of their President. The Motherland can sleep soundly, suspended by the strings I set."

RUS_Persecute_Radicals: "Persecute the Radicals"
RUS_Persecute_Radicals_desc: "It is clear that the scum that dared to raise a hand against me was not just a common thug, but a political radical. There are many like him hiding in Russia, escaping the judgement that ought to befall them in a righteous nation. Their time has, thankfully, come now, for they will no longer escape the day of wrath."

RUS_Focus_On_Socialists: "Focus on the Socialists"
RUS_Focus_On_Socialists_desc: "The former Combat Squads can wait, for they are nothing when compared to the eternal blight. The red wickedness, the seductive spectre of Socialism, has gotten out of control. I will be doing the people a favor by dealing with those who feed them lies and think that the upheaval of the French and British revolutions, not to mention the Bolshevik uprising, would somehow save Russia."

RUS_Ban_NSP_PLSR: "Outlaw the NSP & PLSR"
RUS_Ban_NSP_PLSR_desc: "Although already banned from running in the elections, lest they'd infect people's minds with their platform of a mirage 'democratic transformation towards Socialism', the NSP and the PLSR are still allowed to operate. It's a mistake that I should have never allowed to happen, for their consistent propaganda campaign among the population played a big part in leading to the recent instability. Their entire existence has to be shut down."

RUS_Remember_1917: "Remember 1917"
RUS_Remember_1917_desc: "We should never forget where the Left SRs and the NSP were back in the tragic year of 1917, the Bolshevik attempt at plunging the very essence of Russia into material terror. I could never forgive Spiridonova's party for being at least supportive of the Leninists, while Bukharin was part of the very brutes strangling Russia. They have to be dealt with immediately."

RUS_Focus_On_Savinkovites: "Focus on the Savinkovites"
RUS_Focus_On_Savinkovites_desc: "Despite the Socialists posing a considerable threat to my rule ever since I came to power, the betrayal of a former associate is more brutal. The many members of the SR Combat Squads that joined Savinkov's party need to be stopped before they put a stain on the Socialist-Revolutionary legacy that could not be wiped away in the future."

RUS_Ban_NRPR: "Ban the NRPR"
RUS_Ban_NRPR_desc: "While they may claim to represent the people's will, the same as I do, to form a national state fit for the modern era, the NRPR are nothing more than dangerous radicals spewing slogans filled with pseudo-Hegelian nonsense. Their drive towards a coming Apocalypse that would usher in the Third Russia is delusional, and such the only place for their party is in a mental asylum."

RUS_Condemn_Radicalism: "Condemn Right Radicalism"
RUS_Condemn_Radicalism_desc: "The sweeping tide of the right-wing has been an increasingly concerning issue on the global stage, a situation to which our homegrown radicals also contributed. It is not enough that they have fomented an atmosphere of hate in their Motherland, but in recent years influenced movements outside of the Russian boundary. I must ensure that this disease does not spread further."

RUS_Respect_The_Minsk_Treaty: "Respect the Minsk Treaty"
RUS_Respect_The_Minsk_Treaty_desc: "We would gain nothing by breaking the promises that bind Russia ever since the end of the war, at least in spirit if not on paper. For who would I be if I alone could plunge Russia into the fires of conflict like the deluded Nicholas II did? A common fool, nothing more. Let us negotiate with the representatives of Berlin, there is nothing to lose."

RUS_Join_The_Reichspakt: "Russia in the Reichspakt"
RUS_Join_The_Reichspakt_desc: "The Russian people could not have called their German neighbors friends ever since the breakdown of the League of the Three Emperors, an ambitious project by the great Otto von Bismarck. Yet, with a successful mission to Berlin I have proven myself to be a statesman no lesser than the powerful Reichskanzler, for the great Eastern bear will now support the Central European eagle in its mission."

RUS_Try_To_Change_Terms: "An Attempt at Renegotiations"
RUS_Try_To_Change_Terms_desc: "While the Treaty of Minsk will have to stay, that much has been made abundantly clear, it does not mean that we cannot try at changing the provisions of the paper. My best diplomats will work to convince the Kaiser and his representatives that the continued and peaceful state between our nations can only be preserved with an inclusion of necessary changes to the treaty."

RUS_Negotiations_Fail: "Negotiations Fail!"
RUS_Negotiations_Fail_desc: "Do not think that I have come to bring war to Germany. I have come to bring peace, not a sword. But you have denied me, your hearts have been hardened and made deaf to the pleas of the good people of Russia. I shall set every man, every woman, every child, against you."

RUS_Destroy_German_Imperialists: "Challenge German Imperialism"
RUS_Destroy_German_Imperialists_desc: "The whole Reich will be a burning waste of salt and sulfur, nothing planted, nothing sprouting, no vegetation growing on it.

RUS_Solving_Territorial_Disputes: "Solve Territorial Disputes"
RUS_Solving_Territorial_Disputes_desc: "With our new found position in the Reichspakt it is only natural that we would want to re-negotiate certain 'temporary' arrangements on the map. There are many in the Oststaats that were left wanting for their natural Motherland to come back, and thus we have to solve certain issues that arose in an environment the people and I found ourselves in."

RUS_Dissolve_Duma: "Dissolve the Duma"
RUS_Dissolve_Duma_desc: "While once serving the greatest mission one could be tasked with, the members of the Duma have become useless and corrupt as my rule went on. They were jealous of the position of the President, and seemingly helped in orchestrating the wave of instability that shocked Russia. The institution cannot be allowed to continue its business, let us shut it down for good."

RUS_Emergency_Powers: "Emergency Powers to President Kerensky"
RUS_Emergency_Powers_desc: "While the Committee for the Salvation of the Republic has already been granted considerable powers, they were split between multiple members of the KSR on an extra-legal basis. While such a solution was fine enough for a temporary measure, the continued reform of Russia will require a strong position enshrined in law. This is exactly why my personal office, the Presidency, shall be granted special powers previously only implied by the decrees."

RUS_Eradicate_Extremism: "Eradicate Extremism"
RUS_Eradicate_Extremism_desc: "All things in moderation in all spheres of life, even politics. That is exactly why the extremists oh so common in the modern Russian political landscape concern me so deeply. They are amiss of how the world ought to be and that has to change, once and for all."

RUS_Arrest_Savinkov: "Arrest Savinkov"
RUS_Arrest_Savinkov_desc: "One could be perhaps surprised by the actions of Boris Viktorovich, if not for the fact that I always knew what kind of man Savinkov is. He never had any civility in politics nor common sense in social spheres. He is but a rabid beast with no other purpose than to be put down, the sooner the better."

RUS_Eternal_President: "The Eternal President"
RUS_Eternal_President_desc: "The haunted ages of petty dictators, Tsarist samoderzhaviye, and violent radicals deluded by visions of shattering the 'chains' has been finally exorcised from the soul of Russia. It is by my hands alone that the Federative Republic, singed off of its flaws, survived and can move into the future with a vision of boundless prosperity. Yet this situation cannot be endangered by a lesser man stepping into my position. A president that is one with the very spirit of the nation, without whom the nation cannot exist, that Russia shall have."

RUS_Empower_President: "Empower the Executive"
RUS_Empower_President_desc: "It is stunning how much I would have been able to accomplish if only I were elected the president of America and not Russia. The system that their Founding Fathers enshrined, with certain notable modifications along the way, was vital in ensuring their success. The people of Russia may be shocked, but a strong president is the only way that the government will be able to function during the coming calamities."

RUS_Empower_Duma: "Empower the Duma"
RUS_Empower_Duma_desc: "The Duma, despite its many flaws, has been an undeniable boon for all of the efforts undertaken during my presidency. It is clear that empowering it for now is the only course of action if I want to proceed in reforming the internal politics of Russia."

RUS_Witch_hunt: "The Final Witch Hunt"
RUS_Witch_hunt_desc: "While the parties of the far-left and the far-right have been vanquished, my people cannot rest until so-called independent radicals are free to roam the streets. A grand operation is to be carried out, perhaps the greatest law enforcement sweep since the days of the Tsars. Soon, no revolutionary no matter their 'color' will escape from our iron sights."

### Focuses ###
RUS_black_monday: "Black Monday Hits Russia"
RUS_black_monday_desc: "Black Monday has hit our country, but we still don't know how to combat it. It will be nice if government create a special committee to deal with economic crisis."
RUS_taxes: "Increase Taxes"
RUS_taxes_desc: "With our budget deficit becoming uncontrollable, the only way our government sees is to increase taxation. Even if it will cause some political problems, the amount of money in circulations will decrease and fight inflation."
RUS_currency: "Stabilize the Ruble"
RUS_currency_desc: "When the Black Monday hit Russia, the Ruble drastically dropped in its value and the currency was taken off the Gold Standard. Now that some time has been allowed to pass, we can properly reintroduce the Ruble in its new floating form and increase our efforts to stabilize it."
RUS_black_monday_recovery: "Black Monday Recovery"
RUS_black_monday_recovery_desc: "We have weathered the storm. While it still will take some time for our economy to fully recover, the initial stabilization after Black Monday is done."
RUS_Establish_The_VES: "Establish the VSNKh"
RUS_Establish_The_VES_desc: "The experience of the past twenty years demonstrated clearly that a disjointed policy of industrial development cannot uplit our Motherland from its dire state. With our consolidation of the state apparatus, we can finally set our sights on establishing a central entity governing the economic growth of our nation. The 'Supreme Board of the National Economy' shall ensure that every region in Russia can be brought to standards befitting a truly modern nation."

RUS_Ural_Tractor_Plants: "Complexes in the Urals"
RUS_Ural_Tractor_Plants_desc: "The question inherent to any industrialized nation is where to place the factory sectors. One may suggest that the heartlands are the obvious choice, yet for Russia those are too close to inevitable conflicts our brave people may find themselves in. Thus we shall establish specialized complexes producing mechanized vehicles across the Ural Mountains, far from the range of any bomber which may fly from either the West or the East."

RUS_Machine_And_Tractor_Stations: "Machine & Tractor Stations"
RUS_Machine_And_Tractor_Stations_desc: "The Land Reform promised by Vozhd Savinkov allowed for the creation of multiple farms in Central Russia. The next step is to provide our peasants with agricultural equipment, connected to the new initiative known as Machine & Tractor Stations. Organized as specialized rural agencies, the MTS shall guarantee that every farmer tending to our shared land is provided with only the best of new machinery."

RUS_Railway_Nationalisation: "The Iron Veins"
RUS_Railway_Nationalisation_desc: "You would not allow someone else to control your blood veins, turning you into their puppet. The same logic applies to the rail infrastructure of Russia, the iron veins of our Motherland. The Vozhd decreed that all railways and trains shall be nationalized, and then brought into modern standards, with utmost haste, lest elements hostile to our mission shall sabotage our lifelines."

RUS_Korporatsiya_Yusupova: "The Inevitable Industrialisation"
RUS_Korporatsiya_Yusupova_desc: "Despite the People's Republican Party of Russia overwhelming focus on the matters concerning the rural population and peasantry, we cannot deny that extensive industry is the future. The previous governments failed to deal with the backwardness spread across the non-urban centers, which means it falls to us to bring the light of this certain 'progress' to the regions."

RUS_Economic_Draft_Scheme: "Economic Draft Scheme"
RUS_Economic_Draft_Scheme_desc: "Although we have made great strides in improving the industrial capabilities of our nation, there is still a large labour pool of able-bodied Russians we could mobilize. We shall enact a scheme that will allow men to avoid the military draft in exchange for three years of service at state owned facilities, with social and financial incentives for each additional year served beyond that."

RUS_Reinstitute_The_Zemstva: "Reinstitute the Zemstva"
RUS_Reinstitute_The_Zemstva_desc: "The Zemstvo is a form of local governance and representation first introduced by Alexander II in 1864. It strongly weights favour to aristocrats but it still assures representation of the lower classes. It will, without a doubt, assure stability in our torn nation."

RUS_National_Investment_Bank: "National Investment Bank"
RUS_National_Investment_Bank_desc: "A national investment bank will safeguard not only the resources invested by the Zemstvo, but should also offer beneficial loans to local projects. This bank will also help us to control many transactions of our Zemstva and the local businessmen."

RUS_Local_Development: "Local Development"
RUS_Local_Development_desc: "The large, bloated state apparatus of the past has often been a hindrance to local development as directives slowly trickled down through an inefficient chain of command. The best way to tackle this is to delegate more responsibilities to local structures of government led by the regional landowners. After all, who knows better how to improve local affairs than the people that own those land?"

RUS_Zemstvo_Research_Initiatives: "Zemstvo Research Initiatives"
RUS_Zemstvo_Research_Initiatives_desc: "Economies, and businesses, need to be kept competitive in order to grow and expand. We should invest not only in these actual businesses but also the theories behind them. With sufficient science funding, it should benefit not only local companies, but Russia as a whole."

RUS_War_Preparations_Programme: "War Preparations Programme"
RUS_War_Preparations_Programme_desc: "With Russia's economy once again looking strong there's no doubt that our neighbours will look at us with envy hunger. We must make no mistake, a civilian economy in a time of war would end the rising star in a matter of months."

RUS_Funding_Frenzy: "Funding Frenzy"
RUS_Funding_Frenzy_desc: "By offering more economic support and tax reductions to the Zemstvo, we can make sure they start funding local projects like never before. More over it will strengthen the connections between the people of Russia and these new established state authorities."

RUS_Restructure_Economy: "Restructure the Economy"
RUS_Restructure_Economy_desc: "After the Black Monday the Economy was in ruins, but hopefully now we can restructure it and start our industrialisation efforts."

RUS_Bureaucratic_Overhaul: "Bureaucratic Overhaul"
RUS_Bureaucratic_Overhaul_desc: "Our economy should, no matter what our government may look like, be governed by faceless but loyal bureaucrats. We need to remove the old Guard of the Kerensky regime and set up something else. Something new."

RUS_MinProm: "MinProm"
RUS_MinProm_desc: "Ministry of Industry or 'MinProm' in Russian is a united ministry, which will reorganise the industry in our country. Its first task will be to delegate industrial investments to several urban centres in order to boost our industry logically."

RUS_Agricultural_Modernisation: "Agricultural Modernisation"
RUS_Agricultural_Modernisation_desc: "In the eyes of the rest of the world, Russia is considered a backwards, poor country. We will show them that they are wrong, harnessing the massive resources hidden in the countryside through new technologies."

RUS_Military_Production_Act: "Military Production Act"
RUS_Military_Production_Act_desc: "Many of our military setbacks in the Weltkrieg were the result of shortages and shortcomings due to our outdated military industry. Proposed by our lawmakers, the MPA seeks to impose new standards and regulations on our military industry to bolster production quotas. While meeting these standards will be costly in the short term, it'll allow us to improve our production in the long term."

RUS_Economic_Efficiency_Act: "Economic Efficiency Act"
RUS_Economic_Efficiency_Act_desc: "Russia was the last great power in Europe to industrialize and as a result our industries have struggled to compete with its western rivals. The newly proposed ECA seeks to rectify this by creating a new legal framework for industrial production and safety standards. Though costly in the short term, it will be worth it once Russian factories can outproduce their western competitors in both quality and quantity!"

RUS_National_Administration_School: "National Administration School"
RUS_National_Administration_School_desc: "With the new bureaucracy steadily growing we should set up a National Administration School which prepares our future army of bureaucrats for the necessary work ahead of them."

RUS_Cooperative_Capitalism: "Cooperative Capitalism"
RUS_Cooperative_Capitalism_desc: "In the spirit of democracy, we should grant strong, local governance to the communes of our nation. Russia is a massive nation and to believe that it could all be governed from a single place is crazy!"

RUS_New_Industrial_Programme: "New Industrial Programme"
RUS_New_Industrial_Programme_desc: "By industrialising the far reaches of our country side we do not only make sure our whole nation stays alive, but also that targeting our industries becomes much more difficult for our enemies. More over it will help us to reduce the unemployment rate in Russia."

RUS_Industry_In_The_Urals: "Industry in the Urals"
RUS_Industry_In_The_Urals_desc: "When the industrial revolution came to Russia its riches rarely stretched beyond the major cities. Beyond the Ural mountains many localities rely on the same trades that they have since Ivan IV's eastward expansion. Instead of further industrializing the already wealthy cities, it's high time that we brought the riches of the Industrial revolution to the Urals and beyond."

RUS_The_Wealth_Of_Siberia: "The Wealth of Siberia"
RUS_The_Wealth_Of_Siberia_desc: "Beneath the Siberian soil there's an immense untapped wealth of resources. Metals, minerals and fuels that surpass the output of entire empires is within our reach. By investing capital and expertise into the neglected regions of our east, we can turn Siberia into an economic powerhouse as the crown jewel of our resource industry."

RUS_Education_Campaigns: "Education Campaigns"
RUS_Education_Campaigns_desc: "The Russian nation, torn apart by social and political unrest, has been unable to initiate any massive education programs successfully. There's still a large rural population dominating the countryside. A school in every village will allow us to integrate even more people in our society and economy."

RUS_Decentralised_Logistics: "Decentralised Logistics"
RUS_Decentralised_Logistics_desc: "Russia's size is both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness. As hard as it is for hostile armies to remain in supply, it is so too for our armies. By establishing local supply points in key areas, we can make sure our troops stay in good supply at all times."

RUS_Expand_The_Railway_Network: "Expand the Railway Network"
RUS_Expand_The_Railway_Network_desc: "The importance of our railways to our military and economy cannot be overstated. With the infrastructure therein strained by growth, we must expand it, building new railways and junctions using newer technology."


### Savinkov Tree ###
RUS_savinkov: "Savinkov Shapes the Destiny"
RUS_savinkov_desc: "'There was the desire, and I accomplished my task. Now the desire is gone. Why should I do anything? For the stage? For the puppet show?'\n\nMuch has changed since Boris Savinkov wrote such words as a reflection on the 1905 Revolution, in a way his sense of belonging to the nation and purpose of his actions was renewed. Through his own individualist strength, the will of a man above the ordinary vanity, the man has risen to the very top. It is now time for the sole unit to shape the future of the state."

RUS_A_New_Russia: "True Revolution"
RUS_A_New_Russia_desc: "Russia experienced multiple Revolutions by this point, and all of them have failed. Be it in their supposed purpose or in their methods. The traitor Bolsheviks were vanquished, but has the Republican government not betrayed the people the same? Breaking the promise of a happy life to all in the Motherland. The Vozhd has a special obligation to carry out the vision trampled under the boots of the politicians and generals, the ideologues and brutes. No longer shall cowards deceive our countrymen, a True Revolution is about to begin."

RUS_Natsguardiya: "The Parallel of Natsgvardiya"
RUS_Natsguardiya_desc: "While the Combat Squads helped restore order in our nation and have been granted an extended commission of keeping peace, it would be foolish to give so much power to sole organization. Much to Abakumov's chagrin, Savinkov issued a new 'Dekret' organizing the 'National Guard', in some ways modelled after the one in America. But the Natsgvardiya of our own shall be loyal only to the office of the President himself, and thus the Vozhd which has subsumed it. Being recruited and stationed in every region of our Motherland the National Guard shall ensure that no revolt may ever threaten the position of our leader."

RUS_Yunarmiya: "Found the NSSR"
RUS_Yunarmiya_desc: "With the collapse of the Empire and the establishment of the temporary Bolshevik government, the 'Russian Scouts' movement was shattered into multiple entities. While most of the ideologically socialist ones were disbanded in the aftermath of the War, many organizations such as the liberal 'National Organization of Russian Scouts' or the conservative 'Organization of Russian Young Pathfinders' continued to exist. With the rise of our party, we must ensure that the future generations of Russia can grow up with the proper values enshrined in them, and thus the old splinter groups shall be amalgamated into a reformed organization, the 'People's Union of Russian Scouts' (Narodnyy Soyuz Skautov Rossii)."

RUS_fight_corruption: "Anti-Corruption Campaigns"
RUS_fight_corruption_desc: "The fallacy of thought that the heads of state in Russia had no hand in its destitution and collapse has run for centuries by now, exemplified in the saying 'Tsar is good and the boyars are evil.' The blame one could put on the monarchs which allowed corruption to run rampant can be put on the government of Kerensky, but they are all gone. With our hold on power we can turn our rightful judgement towards those who steal from the good people of Russia."

RUS_purge_leftists_savinkov: "Severing the Past"
RUS_purge_leftists_savinkov_desc: "It is no secret that Boris V. Savinkov has been a long-time member of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party before the events of recent decades and the creation of the NRPR. While he no longer believes in all the doctrines of that side of the spectrum, they were grandly formative upon his philosophy.\n\n'Happy is he who believes in socialism, in the coming paradise on earth.'\n\nNo one exactly knows why the Vozhd ordered immediate actions against all the Socialists in our Motherland, despite his focused hatred against the Bolsheviks specifically whom he holds as traitors that reject the kinship of their countrymen. Perhaps the SRs are no different in his mind, or perhaps it's about cutting loose ends, freeing yourself from the past."

RUS_Cossack_Forces: "Utilize the Hosts' Troops"
RUS_Cossack_Forces_desc: "The Hosts of our new allies have proven their merit on the battlefield numerous times in the days of the Tsardom and the Civil War. While the Combat Squads already increased the size of our army, infusing it with the Cossacks would be not only beneficial but also ensure those wild spirits can find an appropriate outlet."
rus_cossack_forces_tt: "\n§GRaise§! 4 §YIrregular Cavalry§! divisions with the following composition:\n - 4 £GFX_unit_irregular_cavalry_icon_small battalions.\n"


RUS_Support_Cossacks: "The Cossack Bedrock"
RUS_Support_Cossacks_desc: "The Cossacks should, according to Vozhd Savinkov, serve as a bedrock for the renewal of Russia. It is due to their tradition as proud martial warriors and 'owners' of vast swathes of land while still being freemen, something which the peasantry of Russia has been granted under our government. The Cossack spirit, their non-aristocratic 'noble' soul should be the blueprint from which the rest of our population can learn."

RUS_True_Federation: "True Federation"
RUS_True_Federation_desc: ""

RUS_Ally_Evraziytsy: "Connections to Eurasia"
RUS_Ally_Evraziytsy_desc: "The Eurasianists, despite being an inherently aristocratic movement, might still prove useful in shaping the future foreign policy of a renewed Russia. It would also not be an outrageous request for an alliance, considering the National-Maximalist faction of their party and their leader Prince Yuri Shirinsky-Shikhmatov are deeply influenced by Savinkovism. Yet an open alliance with them may seem too radical to the rest of the Yevraziytsy, and thus we should grant the Orthodox faction's leader Nikolay Trubetzkoy the office of the Minister of Foreign Affairs."

RUS_Combat_Squads: "Ingraining the Combat Squads"
RUS_Combat_Squads_desc: "Our paramilitary wing, the Combat Squads, originates from the breakaway sections of the SRs Fighting Organization. Among its members was Boris Savinkov himself, carrying his experience from such 'Terrorist Organization' as he puts himself and utilizing it during his fight against the governments of post-Civi War Russia. With the increased presence in official government structures the OB now have, it is only logical that their chief Viktor Abakumov and his Ministry of State Security ought to be merged with the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Ensuring that the security of our Motherland is preserved."

RUS_Pale_Horse: "Pale Horse"
RUS_Pale_Horse_desc: "...and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death... - Revelation 6:8\n\nBut he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. - 1 John 2:11"

RUS_Advisory_Parliament: "A Technical Senate"
RUS_Advisory_Parliament_desc: "The recent bouts of political instability have laid bare the utter contempt the old Senate holds for the future of Russia. While most within the party wish to see the chamber abolished or even the building itself blown up we cannot go that far, especially after the Duma was already dissolved. We should instead transform the Senate into an institution gathering the brightest non-political minds of Russia, of course under the careful watch of the masses enrolled in the NRPR."

RUS_Black_Horse: "Black Horse"
RUS_Black_Horse_desc: "...and I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. - Revelation 6:5\n\nBut he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that darkness hath blinded his eyes. - 1 John 2:11"

RUS_propaganda_savinkov: "The Truth of the Man"
RUS_propaganda_savinkov_desc: "Ever since our rise to prominence, the institutions and organizations hostile to our mission have carried out a vicious campaign of negative propaganda, targeting not only our policies but the character of our Vozhd. He has been called anything and everything, tied to any and all radical movements across the world, ridiculous notion. Let us spread the truth about Boris Savinkov, by ensuring that new editions of his books can be distributed in every city and village of Russia."
RUS_vozhd: "A Certain Sense of Glory"
RUS_vozhd_desc: "With the True Revolution in Russia coming to an end, many have declared Boris Viktorovich Savinkov a savior of the Russian people, of the very idea of our Motherland. The old elites have been swept away and the broken promises of the Social Revolution were carried out in full, beyond what anyone might have expected in the past. Yet is the fanatical devotion of his subjects, ensured by those who zealously cling to the structures established with the power of the party, his office and the paramilitaries, what the Revolution was meant to be? Perhaps the real aim of Savinkovism is what never happened.\n\n'I don't want the prayers of slaves... Suppose Christ has set the world alight with the Word. I don't want serene light. Suppose love can save the world. I don't want love.'\n\nThat is the question only the Vozhd can answer, maybe it is only the next part of the 'puppet show' in which he has taken part ever since his SR days.\n\n'Life has become an accursed and empty thing to me in a single hour: all is a lie and all is vanity.'"
RUS_kornilov: "Kornilov Restores Control"
RUS_kornilov_desc: "The Supreme Commander-in-Chief Lavr Kornilov and his Russian All-Military Union have taken over the government apparatus in the wake of the recent instability plaguing Russia. The newly sworn in President Kornilov can now set out on the road towards full stabilization and restoration of a strong Motherland."
RUS_Deal_With_The_Split_In_The_Rovs: "Deal With The Split In The ROVS"
RUS_Deal_With_The_Split_In_The_Rovs_desc: "Despite the loyalty of the commanders and officers within the ROVS organization to Kornilov and his ambitious cause a certain rot began to creep in. The rot of internal strife and divisions between various cliques of the most popular generals. We will not accomplish our ultimate goals if such tensions are not dealt with swiftly and decisively."
RUS_Focus_On_Internal_Situation: "Focus On Internal Situation"
RUS_Focus_On_Internal_Situation_desc: "While it may be undeniable that our Military Union has been suffering from certain sectarian conflicts caused by various cliques coalescing around the most ambitious generals, the ROVS are still more united than most conventional parties. We should not pay too much attention to the petty squabbles mostly carried out by junior officers when our Motherland needs to be saved, for the internal affairs require our immediate attention."
RUS_secure_military: "Secure Military Apparatus"
RUS_secure_military_desc: "Despite the Russian All-Military Union representing the vast majority of the White forces, it does not account for the entirety of the Republican army. In the near two decades that Kerensky had to bring the nation near the brink, a great amount of ideologically suspicious elements enrolled into the armed forces. We need to ensure that they are incapable of exerting any influence, the same going to traitorous elements within our movement such as the Drozdovsky regiments."
RUS_consolidate_the_rule: "Consolidate the Rule"
RUS_consolidate_the_rule_desc: "Despite the immediate threats to our rule having been removed, it does not mean we have dealt with every danger lurking in the shadows. There still remain enemies who would rather bring the country to ruin than see Kornilov restore the glory of our Motherland. That is why we need to immediately secure our position."
RUS_purge_leftists: "Purge Leftists"
RUS_purge_leftists_desc: "Just like rats a vast horde of leftist reprobates escaped our just grasp following the first days of our rule, yet many of the most deluded still remain. The cling foolishly to the notion of 'breaking the chains' which they have convinced themselves have been put upon the people of Russia. But true patriots know that such talk is nothing but vile lies, spread by elements who need to be rejected for the security of our Motherland."
RUS_state_economy: "State Economy"
RUS_state_economy_desc: "If there is one word to describe the Russian economy since the Civil War, it would be 'confused.' Due to the tired rule of our former President and the bickering of politicians unable to agree what shall become with the nation not much developed since the days of the last Tsar our industrial output remained frozen in time. Thanks to our increased authority we can finally end such debates and re-gear the economy to total state control, ensuring clearer objectives for continuous development."
RUS_traditional_values: "Traditional Values"
RUS_traditional_values_desc: "The abolition of the Tsardom and the Civil War have caused immeasurable damage towards the tradition so dear to the common people of Russia. With the vast majority of our movement holding conservative views, it is only natural that we should set out onto a crusade of morals, ensuring that a certain socio-spiritual rebirth can come into existence and renew our lands."
RUS_ban_unions: "Ban Trade Unions"
RUS_ban_unions_desc: "Free trade unions cannot be allowed to exist for much longer. These nefarious radical organizations, dressed up in supposed common sense ideals of 'worker rights' or 'fair labour standards', have proven themselves to be nothing more than fronts for revolutionary socialist organizations and underground political parties. The state alone knows what is the best for the labourers, and thus there is no need for a hostile column to exist within that matter."
RUS_orthodox_support: "Gain Orthodox Support"
RUS_orthodox_support_desc: "The one true and universal Orthodox Church, represented by the Moscow Patriarchate, has been the bedrock upon which our entire nationhood was born. The pious clergy, so shunned and violated by the Bolshevik and liberal Republican regimes, never lost their faith and willingness to help the ordinary folk of our Motherland. Let us restore their rightful place as a powerful and influential voice of how the future of Russia shall be shaped."
RUS_propaganda_focus: "Focus on Propaganda"
RUS_propaganda_focus_desc: "The 20th century ensured that the means of influencing the public opinion have ascended to a level never before seen in the past. A humble radio, situated in every homestead, can become under the right circumstances the greatest weapon against the ideological obscurantism of the population. Every Russian family shall know who they can thank for their renewed spirit and outlook for a more prosperous future."
RUS_full_centralisation: "Full Centralisation"
RUS_full_centralisation_desc: "The idea of the federative republic has been thoroughly discredited by the experiences of the last decades. We do not need such lofty notions as federal 'autonomism' or decentralized councils, in such a state of beings leads only to disorder and bureaucratic confusion. The power under the old Tsardom was centralized around the figure of the monarch, with everyone living in peaceful coexistence and loyalty to his figure. We only need to transport the notion onto our newly established Supreme government."
RUS_form_cabinet: "Form a New Cabinet"
RUS_form_cabinet_desc: "Not much remains in our road of total consolidation of power within the officer of the Supreme Commander, mostly just trivial bureaucratic paperwork, and thus we can turn our gaze towards the creation of a new ministerial cabinet of the Republic. While many loyalists hope to see their beloved Lavr Kornilov confirm his status as the sole sovereign of the state, the burden of saving the entire Motherland is hard to bear on his lonesome. Perhaps it is time to designate a true second-in-command, an eventual successor if a disaster was to ever strike the President."

RUS_loyal_military: "Loyal Military"
RUS_loyal_military_desc: "If not for the hard work our great Commander Kornilov carried out, the ROVS would have surely fallen into a bloody conflict among its members. Yet with the increased scrutiny put onto disloyal confederates of our own and thorough reevaluation of the radical Republican officers the Supreme Commander-in-Chief ensured that the entire force of our Republic shall remain loyal to him and his eventual successor."
kornilov_tsar: "§RKornilov will proclaim himself the Supreme Ruler of Russia!§!"
RUS_kornilov_ruler: "Proclaim Kornilov the Supreme Ruler"
RUS_kornilov_ruler_desc: "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, the man who has saved Russia from its demons, both external and internal, twice over by now is nothing short of a living legend for the people of his beloved Motherland. A true military messiah, he brought not peace but the sword to the traitors and enemies of Russia and, in the process, ensured the total rebirth of the unstable Kerenskyist Republic. We can do nothing more than just honor such deeds by granting our Commander the title of the Supreme Ruler."

RUS_denikin: "The Peasant Marshall"
RUS_denikin_desc: "With the passing of our Commander-in-Chief, Lavr G. Kornilov, Anton Denikin utilized his popularity among the common people of Russia and also rallied his supporters to ensure that his position as the official successor of our previous President remains undisturbed. With his ascensions to the highest offices, the shape of our Republic may yet return to a form acceptable to the old forces represented by the Duma, of course under our terms."

RUS_Stratocratic_Government_denikin: "All Power to the President"
RUS_Stratocratic_Government_denikin_desc: "With the more constitutional minded outlook of our beloved Marshall, perhaps it is time to shift the methods by which we govern. Let us consolidate the powers vested onto our leader in the office of the President, both for the eventual restoration of a 'democracy' and the lessening of the influence the military apparatus, staffed by officers still supportive of the other generals, could exert."
RUS_Stratocratic_Government: "Stratocratic Government"
RUS_Stratocratic_Government_desc: "While the work accomplished thus far by the ROVS administration is admirable, the dead Republic was merely controlled and somewhat governed by military commanders. The new Empire cannot allow itself to fall into the traps of the bureaucratism of the old system, it has to be run like an actual armed force. The entire Imperial system shall be shaped according to the principles governing stratocratic regimes."

RUS_Bring_Prosperity_To_Peasants: "Bring Prosperity to Peasants"
RUS_Bring_Prosperity_To_Peasants_desc: "The Peasant is the backbone of the State and will lead Russia into a new age. To bring prosperity to the peasant is to bring prosperity to the Russian nation. Agricultural Reforms and Tax cuts will help the farmer to increase crop yield and play his part in building our great nation into a superpower. Mechanization and modernization of equipment and farming techniques will radically increase our food exports and help us stabilize our economy in these troubled times. If the masses are prospering, slowly but surely, the higher classes will begin to feel this wonderful effect and our whole nation will move forward as one into the future. Perhaps we may not see the effects of this but our children will surely enjoy the fruits of our toils."

RUS_Desocialization_Trade_Unions: "'Desocialization' of Trade Unions"
RUS_Desocialization_Trade_Unions_desc: "The Desocialization of the Unions is an idea proposed by Denikin to further stabilize our nation and to protect the republic from 'Bolshevik radicals' who wish to halt our walk towards a democratic state under the guidance of our great leader. We will ban all unions related to the leftist radicals and will use the hammer of the state to crush those who dare defy our rules. Though there may be discontent among the masses, we shall enlighten and guide them to the unions related to those who swear allegiance to the vision of our great leader."

RUS_Socialism_Under_Control: "Socialism Under Strict Supervision"
RUS_Socialism_Under_Control_desc: "To prevent a disaster like the October Revolution of 1917, we must implement strict countermeasures in place to make sure that the Reds never raise their heads again. Strict supervision of Socialist parties will help us make sure that there aren’t any unfavorable attitudes being spread among the ignorant masses. The Okhrana will enforce this through a network of informants and spies inside the Leftist Leadership, making sure to cut off the serpent head if any of the suspected leaders start talking about questionable subjects. With the Trade Unions already out of their hands, these Radicals will have to toe the line set by our supreme leader to ensure their survival in our state. The PSR and RSDRP will never bare their dirty fangs towards the innocent Russian people or they will face our wrath."

RUS_legacy_of_the_Whites_denikin: "Memories of the Southern Volunteers"
RUS_legacy_of_the_Whites_denikin_desc: "The Volunteer Army which was crucial in defeating the Bolshevik menace and ultimately saving Russia from certain doom was organized by none other than Marshall Denikin in the Southern regions of Russia. Many good men were forced to flee those territories in the post-war border shifts, men who have proven their valour as dutiful soldiers in the White Army. We should draw on their loyal work for the Motherland and put their experience to good use."
RUS_Legacy_Of_The_Whites: "A Legend Among White Officers"
RUS_Legacy_Of_The_Whites_desc: "The actions, dedication, and deep sense of purpose behind every decision taken by our new Tsar while he commanded the anti-Bolshevik forces have ingrained themselves among the lower strata of our military. There is not a day during which an unsure junior officer does not ask himself 'If Baron Wrangel was here, what would he do?'. Such a legacy is important in ensuring the new army of the Tsardom is not only fanatically loyal to their monarch, but also competent in every mission it is tasked with."

RUS_Recreate_the_Osvag_desc: "OSVAG was formed in the Civil war as an Information Agency to control the flow of sensitive information from one part of the country to others. Under Denikin’s command, this will be reformed into the Ministry of Propaganda to promote the views of our supreme leader and to spread education among the illiterate masses. Using this, we can also diminish radical or extremist views as anti-state and encourage the average Russian to denounce such persons to the police or Okhrana to ensure no further radicalization happens. Although charges of antisemitism have been made against the offices of this division, our supreme leader assures us that these charges have been made by ignorant fools who do not know anything about this world."

RUS_Protector_Of_Slavs_desc: "Denikin has long voiced his views for Pan-Slavic unity, if not in one state, then at least in an alliance. Such an unfathomable and gigantic task is no easy feat, as the different Slavic nations of our world are each in their way unique and require different ways to handle them. Still, Denikin has not given up and has prioritized meetings with ambassadors of the different nations to ensure a form of alliance, however weak it may be or even in name but alliance it must be. Their Sovereignty will be guaranteed and no encroachment will be made into their States."

Marshal Denikin is proud of his army and will make its development as well as its logistical and financial maintenance his top priority. "

RUS_Restore_Duma_desc: "The Duma is an essential institution of Russia and its democracy, allowing the entire Russian people to express their will through representatives of different parties using the vote. Denikin is not a dictator and is well aware of his people's attachment to democracy and the Duma, and has therefore decided to restore this essential assembly, although full democracy can only return to Russia when the situation is suitable for such a restoration, we can be sure that the Marshal will restore democracy when the necessary conditions are met."

Some have even started calling him the Great Savior for whom the Russian people have waited for all these years. Denikin, on the other hand, calls himself a True Patriot who is ready to serve his Motherland and also allow other people to serve the Motherland as well. Hence Denikin has declared that elections will be held for the Russians to elect their representatives but he will remain president, to ensure the peaceful transition of power from the military dictatorship and to make sure no radical or extremist can deceive the masses and take Russia down a dark path and leave it in shambles."

This duty has been maintained ever since Constantinople fell to the barbaric arms of the Turks nearly 500 years ago, and as the inheritor of such a mantle its people and monarch became the 'Katechon', the bearer of the responsibility to hold back all that is evil and satanical from overtaking the world. God-Bearing Russia and its people were dragged to its Golgotha in 1917 to be crucified and made an atoning sacrifice, emerging stronger and more faithful than ever before.

RUS_Gorgulov_desc: "In the wake of the Boris Savinkov's death, the true Russians, ones forced into the margins by the traitors within the NRPR and their unwillingness to commit fully to the agrarian people's ideal, have made their bold move. The All-Russian People's Peasant Party of the Greens, directed by the Pavel Timofeyevich Gorgulov, a former doctor and veteran of the Civil War, has now taken the reins of the Great Russian Beast, ready to charge into the so-called modernity and shatter the Western order."

It is not enough that a singular man is allowed to shape the destiny and future of Russia, especially if the people do not back him with all of their vital forces.

RUS_Persecute_Monarchists_desc: "Many former oppressors have hoped that the ascent of a veteran of the Whites would herald a restoration of their position and lands. They are sorely mistaken, for the peasants of Russia have suffered long enough under the yoke of the serflords. 'Reformed' boyars run mad with the Westernizer infection brought into Russia by the Devil-Tsar Peter I. We have no love for the monarchists, aristocrats, oligarchs.

What's worse is such delusions have been used to bewitch our proud peasants to make them work for nothing less than aristocrats of the warped future. The world of money shall burn, its followers shall burn, and on ashes true prosperity shall grow anew."

RUS_Savage_Nationalism: "Savage Steppe Nationalism"
RUS_Savage_Nationalism_desc: "Much has been said about how Russians are unrepentant, ungovernable and unwilling to follow the customs and methods of the West. And that is indeed true, it is our greatest strength against the decadent world. For we have inherited a wild and savage nature from the steppes of Eurasia, forging our people into avatars of the Sword of 'Mars', the powerful war God the foreigners called the Scythian 'Ares' so revered by those who came before. Let that legacy reshape our primitive nationalism."

RUS_Republic_Of_Peasants: "Return to the Traditional Base"
RUS_Republic_Of_Peasants_desc: "The common man, a simple peasant, was always the true blood and flesh of our Russia.

RUS_Form_Village_Cooperatives: "Our Village Cooperatives"
RUS_Form_Village_Cooperatives_desc: "The Reds, despite spreading falsehoods and lies to our people, did find a fruitful ground for gathering followers among the Russian peasantry. It was chiefly due to the promise of reform and cooperation between the agrarian masses, a feeling which we need to address with utmost haste. A series of village cooperatives shall be established across our land, ensuring that the common bonds of the people of this earth are strengthened and the socialistic variants of this idea are defeated."

The humble horse-drawn cart, known as Tachanka, equipped with a machine gun has long sown terror and dread across the lines drawn by the Civil War.

RUS_A_Violet_Will_Defeat_A_Machine: "The Violet Will Defeat the Machine"
RUS_A_Violet_Will_Defeat_A_Machine_desc: "'Fialka pobedit mashinu!'\nWith such exclamations our Vozhd Gorgulov greets both his enemies and friends, re-affirming his long-held stance on the nature of modern reality itself. For the words 'Violet will defeat the machine' may sound meaningless, yet they carry a profound message. The simple and weak violet, associated with delicacy and love, is but a symbol that nature no matter its severity will always overcome the sickness brought by the modern world's machinery. But the 'machine' is not only physical, it too refers to the Western-model states themselves, corrupting the folk-bound collective into uncaring individuals. And thus the philosophy of us, the Greens, can be expressed by just the humble violet."

Yet despite what many think is a delusion we know is the honest truth. The wild and barbarous steppes of Skythia should guide us into the future. For the Ordas established by our ancestors struck fear into the hearts of the so-called 'civilized' entities like the Greek polities."

RUS_Here_Comes_The_Messiah: "The New Messiah"
RUS_Here_Comes_The_Messiah_desc: "After our second ancestral faith of Orthodoxy was cleansed with our first ancestral faith, the judaizer deviations were cast away in favour of the true fusion of the Old Gods and the Logos Incarnate. The truth of that would not have been revealed to the good Russian people if not for their new Messiah, Pavel Gorgulov, the second God-Son of our Heavenly Sky Father. Let us praise our newly consecrated Saviour and carry out the Highest Will in his name and image."

RUS_Green_Legionnaries_desc: "The most radical in the legions established by our predecessor are a perfect foundation for a force loyal to our cause, yet they are too centralized around the seat of power and lacking in numbers. We should look back to the tradition of the Green Armies of the Civil War, once again bringing the galvanized peasant masses to massacre the enemies of Russia and ensure their way of life can continue."

RUS_Russia_For_Russians: "Purity of the Autochtons"
RUS_Russia_For_Russians_desc: "Russia will never be reborn if it continues to be corrupted by elements which are foreign to its bloodstream. For it was our shared ethnos, our faith, the pure expression of the collective will of the autochthonous Rus tracing back their ancestry to the Scythian progenitors, which allowed us to overcome every hardship. Everyone that does not fit such categories shall be forced to renounce their citizenship and either flee, or let the renewed Gods judge them."

RUS_Neopaganism_desc: "The decadent clergy and their hedonistic, selfish elitism have only made the otherwise-pure Russian people weak and subservient to false conceptions of God built on modernity’s mortal sins. Most of the corrupt clergy and the rest of the Orthodox Church’s rotting subsections shall be torn down and eradicated, replaced with humble loyalists from both Christian and Neo-Pagan backgrounds while certain revitalized ideas of Slavic and Skythian-based Neopaganism shall fill in the holes we gouge out of both this decayed old order and any other false faith that infect Russia, rebuilding the Faith anew specifically to fit the needs of true ethnic Russians, for only ethnic Russians devoted to this new faith shall be allowed citizenship. With this cleansing, we can finally return to the gnarled and ancient roots of our spiritual history, linking past and present in a reborn and syncretic faith that shall guide us into a bright, pious, strong, and pure future. We praise Thee, O Rod, Perun, Svarog, and Christ!"

RUS_Eternal_Fraternity: "Swear on Fraternal Blood"
RUS_Eternal_Fraternity_desc: "The great folk of Scythia existed within the tribal structures on the bigger scale, yet they also had particular and strong connections of blood with their closest compatriots. Be it due to serving in the same wars or just working on the same matter, a fraternal bond was the highest value held among the people of the old steppes. We should adopt that outlook in the current days, for Russians divided can only weaken the shared national mission laid out by our Green Vozhd."

RUS_Gorgulov_Cult_Of_Personality: "Gorgulov's Version"
RUS_Gorgulov_Cult_Of_Personality_desc: "Our Vozhd's mind is an enigma to most of the population, especially considering he does not make grand political speeches or write meaningless drivel in the form of ideological dissertations. Yet the idea of the Peasant Revolution, of the Green Dictatorship restoring Russia through the hands of its new Saviour, does indeed have a basis, scattered across newspapers, books, and brief notes of Gorgulov. Let us create an illustrated incarnation of his thought, a sort of 'Biblia Pauperum' for the masses who do not require the ability to read long-winded theory."

Let the drums of war sound so the whole world can hear the thunder of our voices, shouting into the heavens with the guidance of the Sky Father. Glory to Vozhd!"

Anyone that has worked within the vast security bureaus now holding primacy in our Motherland can attest to how much of the nation's burden is carried by those honor-bound.

Savinkov and the mastermind behind the plans outlining total subjugation of the state apparatus to the party's will, has risen to the top after the creation of the power vacuum following the late Vozhd's death. Wielding the highest position in our State, Abakumov is now ready to create a Russia which shall never falter under the threat of subversive sabotage, be it external or internal."

With the recent merger of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Ministry of Internal Security, our Vozhd has become the strongest of such Siloviki, yet many more remain across different departments and offices. Let us enlist their help in creating a truly stable Republic, one that cannot bend under any pressure which has been the case so far, when the spineless politicians had any say on state matters."

A grand cleansing of all the disloyal elements shall be held across the entire width of our Motherland, authorized by Abakumov himself."

RUS_Expand_The_Combat_Squads_desc: "The Combat Squads, turned into an official armed section of the People's Republican Party of Russia after its establishment, have long served Boris Savinkov as his most loyal followers and soldiers, willing to be sent wherever need be. It would only be wise to integrate their extensive structures into the official national security apparatus, further expanding their role in maintaining order."

RUS_Art_Of_Propaganda: "Reshaping Their Thoughts"
RUS_Art_Of_Propaganda_desc: "Despite the mass movement our predecessors have built, they never had a precise method or specific ability when it comes to influencing the minds of countrymen not yet enrolled in the party. Thanks to the expanded powers of the ministries, the Russia of Abakumov is now able to creep into the thoughts and desires of any ordinary citizen, even the ones which may hold fear in their hearts."

RUS_Labour_Camps_Abakumov_desc: "Political dissidents, common scum, petty criminals. Call them what you like, there is no denying that such units do not only contribute nothing to the state, but they also actively rob it from the resources. Thus, the vital energies of our prisoners shall be directed towards the improvement of our land, especially in regions in much need of modernization where honest workers could not stand the pre-existing conditions. We can accomplish that by establishing the Main Administration of Correctional Labour Camps."

RUS_State_Capitalism: "All Capital Under the State"
RUS_State_Capitalism_desc: "Owing to its origins as, in part, an ideological splinter from the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, the NRPR has always had a noticeable socialistic element when it comes to the doctrines outlined for the state's relationship with the economy. While our Vozhd agrees that the former course was correct on the matters of national overwatch when it comes to production, the time has come to cast away the red-tinted delusion and instead infuse our industry with much needed capitalism."

RUS_Corporatocracy: "The Oligarch System"
RUS_Corporatocracy_desc: "With the vastness of our territory, managing Russia's resources and industrial development proves to be a considerable challenge, one which even an all-seeing security state may not handle on its own. That is exactly why we should turn to the oft forgotten captains of industry, to the entrepreneurial titans who can uplift entire regions from the muck and mire into heartlands filled with factories."

Despite our recent turn to capitalism and our contacts with industrial oligarchs, the Russian people cannot be allowed to grow meager and decadent at the same time. We have to instill the value of austerity, of refusing and reusing, of the virtue that is temperance."

RUS_Republic_Of_Siloviks: "The Republic of the Strongmen"
RUS_Republic_Of_Siloviks_desc: "It is only thanks to the pure strength exhibited by our glorious Vozhd Viktor Abakumov that our Motherland was able to cast away the chains of weakness which bound it before. The mindset of a Silovik, so foreign to the ineffective and inefficient hordes that came before us, has finally allowed Russia to transform from a backwater into a premier superpower, one able to project its will across not only its own population but also the world beyond."

RUS_VRA_TSAR: "Wrangel is Tsar"
RUS_Black_Tsar: "The Black Tsar"
RUS_Black_Tsar_desc: "Before our former Commander-in-Chief Lavr G. Kornilov died, he named Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel as his designated successor. The 'Black Baron', as he is called, decided that the Romanvos cannot be trusted in restoring the true glory of the former Empire and thus crowned himself as the 'Black Tsar' Pyotr IV. He shall set his sight on restoring the legacy of Tsar Pyotr I, whose name was sullied by the reign of the incompetent Peter III."

RUS_Bonapartism: "Bonapartism"
RUS_Bonapartism_desc: "As much as once can loathe Napoleon I for being the great invader of Russia barely over a century his rulership can serve as a great example of truly modern military monarchy. For is our new Tsar not a great Russian 'Bonaparte', utilizing his charisma and military prowess to restore the greatness of our Motherland, keeping the radical revolutionaries at bay, and selectively implementing reformist ideas if need be?"

RUS_Ban_Socialist_Parties: "Ban All Socialist Parties"
RUS_Ban_Socialist_Parties_desc: "While Commander Kornilov did much good for our case, he certainly did not go far enough in combating the red rot, acting like miasma on our Motherland. It is only logical that with the renewed import of proper Western models worth emulating the degenerated ones have to be combated. And thus any party advocating for policies which can be considered socialistic, a vile West-spawned ideology, have to be immediately removed from the political life of our nation."

RUS_Cooperate_With_VNS: "Cooperate With VNS"
RUS_Cooperate_With_VNS_desc: "The leader of the All-Russian National Union, Vasiliy Shulgin, has long been a friend of the Black Tsar, with some even claiming that he himself floated the idea of Baron Wrangel being crowned as a new Tsar if an eventual restoration was to happen. The VNS is the most powerful conservative party across all of our Motherland, holding great sway among the aristocratic elite of our nation. We cannot waste the opportunity of garnering their support for our restored Empire."

RUS_Teutonic_Discipline: "Teutonic Discipline"
RUS_Teutonic_Discipline_desc: "Peter von Wrangel, born into a Baltic German nobility, is but one among the countless of his group who have served dutifully under the old Tsardom and contributed to its successes. The population of the former Gubernias in what is today the abomination of 'United Baltic Duchy' still holds much loyalty to the institution of the Russian Crown, just as Wrangel's own father Nikolai did as the adjutant to the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch. Let us take inspiration from their strong and disciplined outlook, and instill their positive values into the wider swathes of the Russian population."

RUS_Prussian_Constitutionalism: "Prussian Constitutionalism"
RUS_Prussian_Constitutionalism_desc: "The very notion of a British-style constitutional monarchy is sick, deranged. It servers as nothing but a tool for the bewitched masses to do the bidding of political radicals. A far more worthy inspiration comes from the stable Prussian Landtag system, yet we cannot simply adopt every idea wholesale. Let us take inspiration from it and create a unique 'Russian Constitutionalism.'"

RUS_Cossack_Soul: "Cossack Soul"
RUS_Cossack_Soul_desc: "Pyotr IV served among the Transbaikal Cossack Corp during his early days in the Tsarist military. This experience proved to him what many bright minds in the Empire have always known, the Cossack 'Soul', wild and chaotic as it sometimes may be, is what Russia needs for its continued success. Everyone in our reborn Tsardom should emulate these brave warriors in cases which call for that."

RUS_Autonomy_For_Cossacks: "Autonomy for Cossacks"
RUS_Autonomy_For_Cossacks_desc: "The Cossacks have time and again proven themselves to be the most loyal of the subjects of our great Tsars. They have bravely served on every front in which Russia called for their aid, and thus they deserve to retain the rights given to them by the old Tsardom. We should ensure that they can gather in autonomous hosts across our territory in an effort to ensure their continued support."

RUS_White_Army_Black_Baron: "White Army, Black Baron"
RUS_White_Army_Black_Baron_desc: "The thankfully dead Red Army once sung a song when marching towards their failed cause, singing of the 'White Army' and the 'Black Baron' so set on restoring the Tsarist throne. While they were nothing but fools, they did predict the future. Baron Wrangel has truly restored the Russian Empire to its deserved glory, and for that all within our Motherland should be thankful."

RUS_Gendarme_of_Europe: "Gendarme of Europe"
RUS_Gendarme_of_Europe_desc: "By following in the footsteps of his brother Alexander I, Tsar Nicholas I dealt with upstart revolutionary movements threatening the stability of the entire continent with great haste and ruthlessness. Such dedication earned him the nickname of the 'Gendarme of Europe. ' Pyotr IV shall follow his example, and set his sights against the dark heart of all the future revolutions, France; the birthplace of communism and modern warped royalism, Germany; and the sick man among all the monarchies, torn by ethnic and socialistic strife, Austria."

RUS_Zhukov_Rules_Alone: "Zhukov Rules Alone"
RUS_Zhukov_Rules_Alone_desc: "There is no other military commander within our reborn Red Army so deserving of being the new chief helmsman other than Georgy Zhukov. A Socialist of true zeal and conviction, the general has never forgotten the revolutionary cause even despite having to hide his true intentions from the reactionary monarchist staff of the now dead bourgeois republic. The time has come for his long struggle to be finally rewarded."
RUS_Strengthen_Party: "Strengthen the Party"
RUS_Strengthen_Party_desc: "We cannot allow for the revolution to be hijacked by one madman with dictatorial ambitions. To prevent that exact situation, the Party needs to have it’s powers broadened."
RUS_Strengthen_Chairman: "Strengthen the Chairman"
RUS_Strengthen_Chairman_desc: "For the revolution to be succesful  and the proletariat to be represented, the powers of the Chairman must be broadened so he can safeguard the march of progress."

RUS_Dictatorship_Of_Red_Army_desc: "If the revolution is to survive the turbulent times that await there must be a strong ruling class, free from the cowardice so common against the intellectual and political strata. The honest men of the Red Army must make up the government apparatus, lest it fall into utter chaos and degenerative disorder."
RUS_Cut_Red_Tape: "Fight Bureaucratisation"
RUS_Cut_Red_Tape_desc: "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant fight, something Lenin already understood. We will have to fight the bureaucracy, before it can establish itself already, something we have to avoid at all costs. We will also have to train truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the reactionary bureaucrats we still have plenty of."
RUS_Bureaucratic_Centralism: "Bureaucratic Centralism"
RUS_Bureaucratic_Centralism_desc: "The general Party opinion must be brought in line with the Chairman’s vision. There is no need and no time for discussion."
RUS_Democratic_Socialism: "Democratic Socialism"
RUS_Democratic_Socialism_desc: "We have proven that socialism can be achieved through democratic means. By emulating the example of western democratic socialists an utopia can be made for the Russian workers."
RUS_Proletarian_Humanism: "Proletarian Humanism"
RUS_Proletarian_Humanism_desc: "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role in the All-Union Communist Party. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."
RUS_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict: "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
RUS_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc: "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."
RUS_Voluntary_Collectivisation: "Voluntary Collectivisation"
RUS_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc: "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivisation, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

RUS_Create_The_VSP: "Power to the VSP"
RUS_Create_The_VSP_desc: "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."
RUS_Control_Press: "Control the Press"
RUS_Control_Press_desc: "While some may think the idea of 'free' press would be natural to our Socialist aims they would be only deluding themselves in a reactionary lie. The so-called independent press is governed by the profit motive, bankrolled by the aristocratic elite concerned with keeping the masses ignorant. In a true Communist nation, one we have been tasked with establishing, only the party press organ can be allowed to exist, for everything else is bound to spread falsehoods."
RUS_Break_The_Smychka: "Break the Smychka"
RUS_Break_The_Smychka_desc: "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."
RUS_Mass_Collectivisation: "Mass Collectivisation"
RUS_Mass_Collectivisation_desc: "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar and the capitalist. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of rapid collectivisation of our farms. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."
RUS_Separation_Of_Powers: "Separation of Powers"
RUS_Separation_Of_Powers_desc: "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."
RUS_Cement_Chairman_Authority: "Cement Chairman's Authority"
RUS_Cement_Chairman_Authority_desc: "With our actions we have ensured that the Chairman’s authority is paramount."
RUS_Revolutionary_Commissars: "Revolutionary Commissars"
RUS_Revolutionary_Commissars_desc: "Commissars are to our Socialist state what doctors are for a sick body. They are the first but also final line of defence against creeping rot, against the ideological deviation present within the less zealous segments of our army. Without their hard work, the revolutionary light would have long been shrouded in darkness, for it would lack their purifying touch."
RUS_Labour_Camps: "Labour Camps"
RUS_Labour_Camps_desc: "The reactionaries now rightful put into the category of 'prisoners' are useless on their own, parasites on the good people of Russia. To make sure that they contribute to society and work for their rehabilitation all shall be forced into a grand system of labour camps."
RUS_Prodrazvyorstka: "Prodrazvyorstka"
RUS_Prodrazvyorstka_desc: "Prodrazvyorstka, or food appointment, is the policy of confiscation of grain and other agricultural products from the peasants at nominal fixed prices according to specified quotas. To ensure that our people are equal and content, we must launch a campaign to strike at the greed of the hoarding kulaks."

Glory to the Red Marshall! Glory to Zhukov!"
RUS_Cult_Of_Personality_Zhukov: "Cult of Personality"
RUS_Cult_Of_Personality_Zhukov_desc: "It is only natural that great men of history gather around themselves devout followers. As was the case with Lenin, the ever-living father of our cause, and now is the case with Zhukov. All people within our glorious renewed union cannot express anything but the highest of praise for the revolutionary work carried out by our leader."

RUS_Allow_Small_Traders: "Allow Small Traders"
RUS_Allow_Small_Traders_desc: "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

RUS_Khozraschyot: "Khozraschyot"
RUS_Khozraschyot_desc: "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

RUS_SOV_Establish_The_VVS: "Establish the VVS"
RUS_SOV_Establish_The_VVS_desc: "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."

RUS_SOV_Airspace_Defence: "Airspace Defence"
RUS_SOV_Airspace_Defence_desc: "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilize aircraft in every possible way to conquer our airspace and terrorize the land troops, something we will have to avoid at all costs if we want to be victorious in future encounters."

RUS_SOV_The_ORT_System: "The ORT System"
RUS_SOV_The_ORT_System_desc: "Modern wars are only partially won on the battlefield. Equally important are the men and women behind desks and radios, dealing with intelligence and transmissions. We need to make their work easier."

RUS_SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry: "Nationalise the Aircraft Industry"
RUS_SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc: "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, however often it is still private. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry and integrate it into the state apparatus if we want to create a modern and strong air force."

RUS_SOV_Aviation_Bureaus: "Aviation Bureaus"
RUS_SOV_Aviation_Bureaus_desc: "Opening aviation bureaus throughout the nation will allow us to improve our pilots, something which is always an important duty of the nation, if we want to create a capable air force."

RUS_SOV_New_Fighters: "New Fighters"
RUS_SOV_New_Fighters_desc: "While bombers may damage our opposition, not a single one of them will reach their targets without sufficient protection from our fighters. These fighters can also provide cover for our own troops and industry."

RUS_Equipment_Modernisation: "Equipment Modernisation"
RUS_Equipment_Modernisation_desc: "The Weltkrieg has clearly demonstrated what could have been glimpsed as far back as the Crimean War, the modern world and its military equipment have moved past the Russian Army at a speed the Tsardom was not able to handle. The Republic has, sadly, inherited that sorry state of affairs and must now act. It's high time we took a closer look at various proposed plans concerning modernization of our war-fighting equipment."

RUS_Special_Forces_Office: "Special Forces Office"
RUS_Special_Forces_Office_desc: "Our chief of staff believes that while weight isn't bad, finesse is definitely the better option. With elite units trained for specific circumstances, we can cut enemy lines apart."

RUS_Army_Motorisation: "Expand the AMO"
RUS_Army_Motorisation_desc: "Mechanization of our infantry is very expensive but would offer substantial protection, firepower and mobility to our leg infantry. It won't be easy, but it will be worth it."

RUS_VVSR: "Modernize the VVSR"
RUS_VVSR_desc: "The VVSR (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily Rossii, 'Russian Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."

RUS_The_ORT_System: "The ORT System"
RUS_The_ORT_System_desc: "The Okhrannoye Otdeleniye are ready to set up a so-called Radio Technology System, inspired by foreign technologies. They believe they could keep track of any hostile troop movements if only they are fed enough resources."

RUS_Standardise_Pilot_Training: "Standardise Pilot Training"
RUS_Standardise_Pilot_Training_desc: "Military aviation still bears many of the hallmarks of an emerging craft, one of which is the incredibly haphazard nature by which knowledge is shared. There is no unified training regimen — instead, experienced pilots are expected to find their own way to teach their art, leading to a shockingly inconsistent body of knowledge among our pilots. It is time we standardised this process."

RUS_Promote_Amateur_Flying: "Promote Amateur Flying"
RUS_Promote_Amateur_Flying_desc: "The amateur pilot has been a growing phenomenon — a number of civilians have begun to make a hobby of flying in recent years, with some achieving such impressive feats as flights across the Atlantic and winning great fame. If we cultivate and direct this popular image, we might be able to grow an experienced manpower pool for our air force."

RUS_Night_Witches: "Night Witches"
RUS_Night_Witches_desc: "The renowned aviator Marina Raskova has approached the VVS with a shocking idea: an all-female aviation regiment. Despite all conventional wisdom, there are actually certain officers who are supportive of her scheme. They argue that it has immense proaganda value, and may inspire our other pilots to reach bold new heights for Russia."

RUS_Aviation_Bureaus: "Aviation Bureaus"
RUS_Aviation_Bureaus_desc: "Aviation is a delicate craft. A seemingly small flaw can spell disaster in the skies, and designing an aircraft to withstand the rigors of combat demands perfection. Many a dogfight was decided before either plane even took flight: by establishing aviation bureaus across the country, we can proactively design and test more effective aircraft."

RUS_Long_Range_Bombing: "Long Range Bombing"
RUS_Long_Range_Bombing_desc: "As the limits of aviation are pushed, military theorists have conceived of a radical use for the technology: behemoth long-range bombers, operating in enemy industrial regions, and armed with enough firepower to level factories. This doctrine of 'strategic destruction' promises to annihilate the enemy's ability to wage war without so much as a boot on the ground."

RUS_Create_The_VDV: "Create the VDV"
RUS_Create_The_VDV_desc: "Some of the more experimental members of our high command suggests that the motorisation of our troops is only the first step. The next would be to move infantry not by ships or by trucks, but by planes! By dropping so called paratroopers behind enemy lines we can cut off enemy units and hit supply points. This new division of 'airborne forces' — vozdushno-desantnye voyska — would be the tip of the spear."

RUS_Death_From_Above2: "Death from Above"
RUS_Death_From_Above2_desc: "The third dimension of warfare is poised to revolutionise the art as we know it — between its immense tactical and strategic applications, control of the skies is certain to be critical not just to the next Great War, but every war to follow. The Russian military shall embrace the future: the Rodina's sons will no longer languish in misery on the earth, but win glory in the clouds."

RUS_Transpolar_Flights: "Transpolar Flights"
RUS_Transpolar_Flights_desc: "Our proximity to the Arctic has unexpected boons for our aviation industry: there are few better places in the world to put aircraft through their paces.

RUS_Expand_The_Aircraft_Industry: "Expand the Aircraft Industry"
RUS_Expand_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc: "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, but most of it is still in private hands. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry. integrate it into the state apparatus, and expand it considerably if we want to build a modern and strong air force."

RUS_Airspace_Defence: "Airspace Defence"
RUS_Airspace_Defence_desc: "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our skies and terrorise the land troops. Defending our land is no longer enough: the motherland's skies must be as impregnable as her ground if we are to triumph."

RUS_Specialise_in_Ground_Support: "Specialise in Ground Support"
RUS_Specialise_in_Ground_Support_desc: "New technologies open tantalising new possibilities for the development of new bombers. Aircraft may now serve as highly mobile artillery, able to strike enemy positions with precise and devastating attacks, able to be deployed anywhere on a front much faster than conventional support. This surely represents the future of military aviation."

RUS_Maintain_Tactical_Flexibility: "Maintain Tactical Flexibility"
RUS_Maintain_Tactical_Flexibility_desc: "The advance of aviation technology clears the way not only for more nimble aircraft, but also more durable ones. Some schools of theory have begun to champion a new 'tactical' bomber — a ground support craft with more range and survivability than 'close' support. This kind of bomber could perform further from bases and in more adverse conditions, as well as destroy enemy structures."

RUS_Jet_Engine_Experiments: "Jet Engine Experiments"
RUS_Jet_Engine_Experiments_desc: "For all its history, heavier-than-air flight has only been possible via propeller. However, the cutting edge of flight technology suggests that a new method of powered flight may be possible. In theory, an engine could compress air, combine it with fuel, and use the mixture to generate thrust — bypassing the issues inherent to propellers. While clearly insane, sane ideas rarely make breakthroughs."

RUS_Naval_Bomber_Development: "Naval Bomber Development"
RUS_Naval_Bomber_Development_desc: "As on land, the development of military aviation has begun to make its mark at sea. Theorists and designers have devised ways through which aircraft can carry a large enough payload to fell a dreadnought, opening lanes of attack that would be impossible any other way. Some dare to say that air-based firepower could render conventional sea power obsolete entirely."

RUS_Carrier_Development: "Carrier Development"
RUS_Carrier_Development_desc: "While the old guard speaks fondly of battleships, a new generation of naval theoreticians speak of the potential of the aircraft carrier as the future centrepiece of our navies. Each of these floating airfields can carry an armada of fighters and bombers directly into the heart of our foes, giving us unmatched power projection potential."

RUS_High_Command_Reforms: "High Command Reforms"

RUS_National_Planning_School: "National Planning School"
RUS_National_Planning_School_desc: "Wrangel believes that Russia doesn't need to rely on 'wasting lives' at the front lines, if our officers receive proper training and stick to our closely monitored battle plans. New officer schools designed to train young officers on how to follow these plans should be set up."

RUS_Overwhelming_Firepower: "Reform the Army: Shatilov's Plan"
RUS_Overwhelming_Firepower_desc: "Pavel Shatilov advocates for the theories of overwhelming firepower as the cornerstone of our modernization program, hammering enemy positions with artillery before attacking. Additionally, more initiative and responsibility needs to be given to the officer at the front-line."

RUS_Commander_Initiative: "Commander Initiative"
RUS_Commander_Initiative_desc: "Shatilov believes we should give our lower ranking officers clear goals and resources to fulfil those goals, but leave the planning in their hands. This will allow them to take local circumstances into consideration and help them respond accordingly to any changes in those circumstances, making our forces more flexible."

RUS_National_High_Command_Formation_School: "National High Command Formation School"
RUS_National_High_Command_Formation_School_desc: "The final step of Shatilov's plan, before our army stands unmatched, requires us to invest heavily into the officers which we will entrust the front lines to. A National High Command Formation School should help us find the most suitable recruits, leaving us with a new elite officer corps."

RUS_Spearhead_Doctrine: "Reform the Army: Markov's Plan"
RUS_Spearhead_Doctrine_desc: "No one doubts the talents of Markov, put to display in every war since the Russo-Japanese one. During the Weltkrieg he was a close assistant to Denikin. However, his ideas are foreign to many of the general staff of Russia and it might take some persuading to get everyone on board with his plans. Still, Russian tank armies, swift strikes through enemy lines! What a thought!"

RUS_Armour_Modernisation: "Armour Modernisation"

RUS_War_Of_Numbers_desc: "More conservative member of the Russian high command, Anton Denikin, suggests that we should continue to rely on our huge numbers to win any future wars, just as Russia has in the past. Going forward with such a plan would be the easiest and quickest way of reforming the Russian army model."

RUS_Mass_Mobilisation: "Mass Mobilisation"

RUS_Equipment_Standardisation: "Equipment Standardisation"
RUS_Equipment_Standardisation_desc: "By standardising our equipment, and how we produce it, we can assure that our ever-growing army will never lack for rifles. Unarmed men will serve the army quite poorly despite the best efforts of our officers, or so the generals tell us."

RUS_Local_Training_Barracks: "Local Training Barracks"
RUS_Local_Training_Barracks_desc: "Every city, every town, every hamlet should hold their own army barracks, where low ranking officers train the local men into militia formations.

While these ships are expensive they claims that while the Weltkrieg naval warfare was dominated by dreadnoughts, they will soon be overshadowed by the massive aircraft carriers and the punching power of naval bombers."

RUS_Floating_Fortresses: "Reform the Navy: Kolomeitsev Plan"
RUS_Floating_Fortresses_desc: "Vice-Admiral Nikolai Kolomeitsev believes in the power of discipline and of majestic dreadnoughts based on experiences in the Weltkrieg and the Russian civil war. They advocate for these massive warships to remain the centerpieces of our navy."

RUS_War_Under_The_Sea: "Reform the Navy: Monastyriov Plan"
RUS_War_Under_The_Sea_desc: "While carriers and battleships may be the future, it may not be realistic for our young republic to focus on these massive ships. Building a large navy is expensive and [RUS.GetNameDef] does not have the dockyards nor the resources to produce a fleet of that size. Instead we should focus on the cheaper but equally deadly submarines to harass enemy shipping lanes."

RUS_The_Invisible_Navy: "The Invisible Navy"
RUS_The_Invisible_Navy_desc: "The Weltkrieg taught us that it isn't always the biggest naval gun that wins the war. Cheap, silent and deadly submarines can bring entire empires to their knees. With our shipbuilding capacity limited by Brest-Litovsk, focusing on these types of vessels will allow us to quickly regain an offensive capacity in the deep oceans."

RUS_Coastal_Defences: "Coastal Defences"
RUS_Coastal_Defences_desc: "Because our naval capacity has historically been less than that of our natural rivals, many of our naval theoreticians are advocating for a defensive stance against the enemy. By focusing on mining the seas, we could limit their movement at sea and cause losses to their fleets while exposing ourselves to minimal risks."

RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada: "A Destroyer Armada"
RUS_A_Destroyer_Armada_desc: "Destroyers are the backbone of every navy. Considering the fact that the Reichspakt's dominance in the Baltics, this will be doubly true for us. Fast, resourceful and fast to build, we'll need need a large force of these ships if we are to contest the straits and make it into the open seas."

RUS_Fleet_Protectors: "Fleet Protectors"
RUS_Fleet_Protectors_desc: "Until we finish our naval expansion program every ship is valuable and difficult to replace. By having our cruisers act as defensive centerpieces able to protect our screens and capital ships alike, our admiralty believes that we'll be able to greatly improve the survivability of our naval assets."

RUS_Commerce_Raiders: "Commerce Raiders"
RUS_Commerce_Raiders_desc: "Modern cruisers have proved very effective in the past as commerce raiders by combining good mobility with great firepower. Given their potential and our need to strike at the arteries of our enemies, we should devote more resources towards maximizing their effectiveness in this particular role."

RUS_Fleet_Vanguards: "Fleet Vanguards"
RUS_Fleet_Vanguards_desc: "Striking a middle ground between larger battleships and smaller screens, cruisers are a versatile type of ship that can strike hard without being a 'white elephant' for the enemy to strike down. By modernizing their offensive gunnery we'll effectively turn these ships into pocket battleships, hard-hitting ships able to stand up to capital ships in a fight."

RUS_Naval_Infantry: "Naval Infantry"
RUS_Naval_Infantry_desc: "Landings against fortified enemy islands or beaches carried out by regular infantry without special training and equipment is a disaster waiting to happen. If we are to take on the holdings of the empires to our west, south and east, we'll need to establish a new branch of marine infantry to act as the vanguard in any future naval invasion."

RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships: "New Tactics for New Ships"
RUS_New_Tactics_For_New_Ships_desc: "Modern ships are barely any more useful than the ships of the last century if we don't update our naval doctrine as well. Ready as ever, the admiralty has outlined a doctrinal modernization plan that will help us rapidly overhaul our tactics and retrain our officers."

RUS_Modernise_The_Petrograd_Dockyards: "Modernise the Petrograd Dockyards"
RUS_Modernise_The_Petrograd_Dockyards_desc: "With Petrograd being the largest port city in western Russia it's only natural that it will serve as the linchpin for any fleet expansion project. With a relatively modern infrastructure and skilled engineers already in place, modernizing its dockyards be the fastest way of expanding our shipbuilding capacity."

RUS_Modernise_Murmansk: "Modernise Murmansk"
RUS_Modernise_Murmansk_desc: "As a gateway into the Barents Sea, Murmansk could be turned into a pivotal strategic location for our northern navy. Though its facilities are as of yet under-developed, expanding them could allow us to move submarines and other ships into the North Sea and beyond into the Atlantic, bypassing any western navies in the Baltic Sea."

RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints: "Recover Foreign Blueprints"
RUS_Recover_Foreign_Blueprints_desc: "As a result of the decades lost to turmoil, we've fallen significantly behind several of our competitors. With the right resources and connections, however, we could learn from their efforts to speed up our own naval research program."

RUS_Submarines_In_Kamchatka: "Submarines in Kamchatka"
RUS_Submarines_In_Kamchatka_desc: "The loss of Vladivostok primed a generation of naval reformers to focus on smaller and more cost-effective ways to safeguard the Pacific. With all of the Sea of Okhotsk within its reach, basing a submarine fleet in Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky would let us strike at any potential enemy throughout the entire Pacific theater of operations."

RUS_Repair_Sevastopol: "Repair Sevastopol"
RUS_Repair_Sevastopol_desc: "With Crimea once again under Russian control we finally have a warm water port to the south and a permanent foothold in the Black Sea. However, its facilities are currently built with Ukrainian and Reichpakt specifications in mind. We need to rebuild and overhaul Crimea's shipyards and ports to fully utilize its potential!"

RUS_Repair_Vladivostok: "Repair Vladivostok"
RUS_Repair_Vladivostok_desc: "With Vladivostok back under our control we're finally in a position to contest the other world powers for dominance over the Pacific ocean. After decades of Kolchak's neglect and Japanese influence, however, it's pivotal that we renovate the port and bring it up to our naval specification."

RUS_Battleship_Development: "Battleship Development"
RUS_Battleship_Development_desc: "From the carracks of old to the contemporary dreadnoughts, capital ships have been the centerpiece of every major navy for countless centuries. Building these mighty warships isn't just a massive boon to our navies, but also a clear sign to the rest of the world that we have overcome the injustices of Brest-Litovsk once and for all."

RUS_Seek_Allies_desc: "With our bloc established, it's time we sought out allies, for we cannot hope to take on Germany alone."
RUS_Rearmament_Programme: "Rearmament Programme"
RUS_Rearmament_Programme_desc: "As the world burns around us, the order of the senile Kaiser rotting on its own foundations, our former allies in the Weltkrieg preparing to return to Europe, and the Western socialist order preparing to take their revenge, it would be wise for Russia not to stand idly by and prepare for the coming conflicts. For this purpose, the President proposed to the Duma a detailed general rearmament program, one of the few subjects on which almost all political formations in our country can agree. It will be the subject of a non-partisan vote and is sure to pass, as we forge an iron resolve to defend our homeland."
RUS_Bring_Back_Cossacks: "Cossack Resurgence"
RUS_Bring_Back_Cossacks_desc: "The lands known to the world as Don-Kuban have been part of Russia for centuries. That grand link has sadly been severed by the chaos of the Civil War and German meddling, which resulted in rebellious and treacherous Cossack leaders seceding from the Motherland. Despite their elite being rotten, we know these brave men always held Russia in their patriotic hearts. It's high time to resurrect the Cossack spirit and welcome them back into Russia, by force if need be."
RUS_Reclaim_Far_East: "Reclaiming the Far East"
RUS_Reclaim_Far_East_desc: "The Far Eastern Republic was born out of Kolchak’s treachery and Japanese support. Those two forces are mocking us, occupying our rightful territories. We must wipe that traitorous stain off the face of the earth! It's time to reignite the Eastern flame and reclaim what is rightfully ours."
RUS_Expansionism: "Russian Expansionism"
RUS_Expansionism_desc: "The theory of expansionism constitutes that Russia's borders are only as safe as they are distant from our heartland. Every neighboring state which is not a puppet of the Russian state is, as such, a threat or a target, depending on their military and political strength. Our ambitions know no bounds, and we understand that this adaptation of policies will not be well-liked by the rest of the world. But it is time for Russia to be unleashed, reaching beyond its borders."
RUS_Realpolitik: "Masters of Diplomacy"
RUS_Realpolitik_desc: "Realpolitik is politics or diplomacy based primarily on considerations of given circumstances and factors, rather than explicit ideological notions or moral and ethical premises. The term Realpolitik is sometimes used pejoratively to imply politics that are coercive, amoral, or Machiavellian. But as masters of diplomacy, we embrace this pragmatic approach to achieve our strategic goals and secure the greatness of Russia."

russia.1.t: "A Troubled History"
russia.1.d: "After the October Revolution Anti-Bolshevik forces started to consolidate across the former Russian Empire, leading to a massive rebellion against the Soviet Republic in Siberia, and the Don and Kuban steppes during the middle of 1918. The White movement made considerable gains, but could not defeat the well placed Red Army, which still dominated the Russian industrial heartland and transportation networks. The war changed when the German Empire, fearing the success of a dangerous ideology, intervened on behalf of the Whites in exchange for recognition of the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. By January 1920, both Moscow and Petrograd had fallen to the White forces. The majority of White leaders decided to hold the Constituent Assembly, and, as a result, a new Russian Republic was established in the former Imperial capital. For the past fifteen years the leading political parties, the Social Revolutionaries and Kadets, have governed in an uneasy coalition first under president Sazonov, then under Kerensky, maintaining their power through electoral manipulation and a lack of serious political opposition. Today Russia is becoming increasingly unstable, and other political forces are growing. They consider that it is now time for change, so that the country may once again assert its power in the world..."
russia.1.a: "Long live Russia!"
russia.1.b: "I want to know more about Russian lore"

russia.1017.t: "A Troubled History: First Years"
russia.1017.d: "In 1920 a Constituent Assembly was held, elections which, as in 1918, were won by the Socialist-Revolutionary Party. In the absence of the Bolsheviks in the elections, the Liberal Party of Kadets and the Social Democratic Party of Mensheviks, respectively, came in second and third with some margin.\n\nThe Constituent Assembly thus elected decreed that Russia was a democratic federal parliamentary republic with universal suffrage. The parliament consisted of two chambers: the Gossovet and the Duma. The Gossovet (State Council), renamed the Senate in 1925, became a bastion of reactionary conservative forces in the young republic because it was formed in a somewhat authoritarian manner.\n\nIn 1920, according to the Constitution, the Senate elected Russia's first president, Sergei Sazonov, a former prime minister in Kolchak's government. He was a compromise candidate that the conservatives and the military imposed for the sake of the predominantly leftist Duma. The real disaster was the first term of Sazonov's government and the Fifth State Duma. After the civil war, the country faced a devastated economy, peasant uprisings, and famine, caused largely by the Bolshevik "black redistribution." In the course of the "black redistribution," several of the most efficient landed estates, where landlords or wealthy merchants farmed according to advanced European methods, and the yields on such farms could exceed the yields on peasant land by 50 percent, were destroyed. Sazonov never fully resolved the land question by abolishing "black redistribution" and returning land to the landlords in the cities. The famine that engulfed the Volga and southern regions led to a reduction of the population and increased discontent. Sazonov vetoed all attempts by the Socialists to socialize land. The Japanese occupation of Vladivostok and Khabarovsk also contributed to this.\n\nIn 1922, just two years after the ratification of the Minsk Treaty, an uprising occurred in Karelia. Thanks to German mediation, the Eastern Karelian uprising was suppressed by the signing of the Treaty of Tartu, under which the townships of Repola and Porajärvi were ceded to the Kingdom of Finland, but full-scale war was averted and Eastern Karelia remained under Russian rule. Thanks to Sazonov's diplomatic efforts, Russia managed to establish good relations with most of the new states that emerged as a result of the Civil War."

russia.1018.t: "A Troubled History: Consolidating Power"
russia.1018.d: "In the years that followed, the government managed to shake off many of the effects of the Civil War. The economic crisis was coming to an end, and industry began to develop slowly. This was largely due to its vulnerable position in the face of German domination. German business was penetrating into Russia, displacing domestic production and making Russia dependent on the empire. Flirting with the German Empire destroyed the image of the government. Russian industry developed belatedly, and the loss of western territories, rich in human and industrial resources, slowed the process even further. In addition, the democratization of the regime threatened the conservative strata of society, including the Cossacks, wealthy businessmen, and aristocrats.\n\nDissatisfaction with the Sazonov regime and anti-German sentiment grew and culminated in the last months of 1924. The failures of the Sazonov government culminated in spontaneous rallies and protest demonstrations, with the result that Sazonov was forced to resign, and in his place the SRs pushed through Alexander Kerensky, a man who the Duma believed would not interfere with democratic reforms. However, the appointment of a left-wing president did not please the conservatives and the military..."

russia.1019.t: "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.1"
russia.1019.d: "The various Cossack Hosts likewise grew increasingly wary of the government in Petrograd, fearing that a SR majority would strip them of their traditional rights and privileges on behalf of their territories' vast, non-Cossack populations.\nDespite the Putsch's eventual moniker, Alexander Kolchak was a late addition to the conspiracy, as he had been largely content to sit on his laurels in the aftermath of the Civil War. He was, however, the natural figurehead for an anti-German, anti-Kerenskyist coup, as he had already proven himself as a Russian Cincinnatus, who had made hard choices in war-time before relinquishing them in peace. Feeling assured that the Russian military would overwhelmingly side with him over Kerensky, Kolchak signed-on enthusiastically with the plotters.\n\nThe Cossacks, despite their key role in the coming uprising, had diverse and often unclear motivations. Ataman Pyotr Krasnov, despite a well-known reputation for his cooperation with the Germans during the Civil War, signed on with his Kuban counterpart, Nikolay Bukretov, out of shared concerns for the safety of Cossack privileges, as well as continuing resentment over their treatment by fellow White generals in the past. Much the same could be said of Ataman Dutov of the Orenburg Cossacks and Ataman Semyonov of the Transbaikal Cossacks, who valued their past service with Kolchak, and shared concerns over the Russian government's rapprochement with the Central Asian Turkic peoples and Buryats over the Cossacks' concerns.\n\nThe Czechoslovak Legion was the final part of the puzzle, and its concerns were driven overwhelmingly by hatred for the Central Powers, who continued to occupy their homelands, and while some Legionnaires had returned clandestinely over the years, the majority remained in exile in Russia, at the threat of facing trial as traitors back home."

russia.1020.t: "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.2"
russia.1020.d: "The date for the Putsch was set for November 14th, 1924, and it began without issues. Kolchak-aligned Russian and Czechoslovak soldiers surrounded the Winter Palace and other key locations of Petrograd, and telegraph offices were seized to announce the immediate arrest of Kerensky on charges of treasonous profiteering and corruption from deals made with the Germans. Meanwhile, the Cossack forces of Atamans Krasnov and Dutov deployed across Southern Russia and Central Asia, chiefly as a show of force to inspire confidence among the rest of the Russian military.\n\nThe response, however, shocked Kolchak and his backers. Rather than rally to his side, the overwhelming majority of Russian enlisted soldiers and even officers refused to join the putsch, and while they refused to open fire on the putschists, no help was extended from that corner. Kolchak immediately laid the blame for this on the shoulders of General Lavr Kornilov, who, despite himself having launched a coup against Kerensky in 1917, refused to help Kolchak out of lingering resentment for not being chosen as White commander-in-chief during the Civil War. More plausibly, Kornilov and the rest of Russia's military high command likely realized that antagonizing the Germans while Russia was in such a weak state would simply make the situation worse, and that Kerensky was a necessary evil to moderate the demands of the still-strong Socialist presence in the country.\n\nRegardless of their motivations, Russia's military largely stood by and watched as the Putschists tried to seize power. Though Kerensky would claim credit for it in later years, it is unlikely any of his statements from the besieged Winter Palace had made it out to the wider world before mass demonstrations paralyzed Russia's cities. Countrywide strikes were called, and those Putschists outside the major cities found themselves stranded as railroad workers sabotaged their attempts to move. The Putsch in Petrograd would last less than 48 hours, as loyalist military units and public protest convinced Kolchak's supporters to lay down their arms peacefully in exchange for amnesty."

russia.1021.t: "A Troubled History: Kolchak Putsch Pt.3"
russia.1021.d: "Within two weeks, the Cossacks had also all agreed to stand down, albeit with great trepidation for the future. Ataman Dutov was too well ensconced in Central Asia and too beloved by his men to be peacefully removed, and so he was left alone. Much the same could be said of Krasnov and his supporters in the south, who rallied the threat of radical Cossack independence to forestall rash action by the Russian government. Nevertheless, it was likely the German government's own guarantee of a peaceful resolution in southern Russia which saved Krasnov's and Bukretov's regime and establishing a secured border at the Don and Volga rivers, as Mitteleuropa had much to gain with the lingering threat of a Cossack quasi-states.\n\nAs for Kolchak himself, the Admiral and his closest supporters fled east to the Japanese-backed Transamur, the last bastion of "Entente" controlled Russia, wherein he would lay claim to the title of legitimate ruler of Russia. Backed by the Transbaikal Cossack and Eastern Siberian Federalists, the borders were move as far as the Baikal lake and Irkutsk.\n\nKerensky had no choice but to accept what had happened as a fact. The newly formed states were protected by the German and Japanese imperialists, and the country was not ready for a full-fledged war, not yet recovered from the horrors of civil war and with poorly developed industry. Of course, relations with Germany and Japan were damaged, but Russia was still forced to comply with the terms of the Minsk Treaty. Instead of war, Kerensky chose peace, but he also realized the weakness of his power, so it was the following years that shaped Russian reality as it is now."

russia.1022.t: "A Troubled History: New Rules"
russia.1022.d: "Kerensky's first term was marred not only by the Kolchak campaign, but also by the rise of radicalism in society and the creation of new parties and organizations that demanded radical changes. The bloc 'New Bolsheviks', created by Rykov and Bukharin, took shape as a political party - the NSP and began to promote its ideas of a gradual transition to socialism. And after the Kolchak coup and the loss of the Kuban and Eastern Siberia in the wake of anti-German sentiment, Boris Savinkov, relying on the peasant electorate, creates a huge bloc of right-wing parties - the People's Republican Party of Russia.\n\nAlready in 1925 Kerensky's reaction followed. He began his transformation and strengthening of his own power. The State Council was renamed the Senate, and the procedure for election to it was changed. It became an institution composed of 150 senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations, 50 of whom are appointed by the regional legislatures, 50 - by the president and 50 - elected by the people with sufficient age (30 years) and higher education or social status (former aristocracy) or personal wealth.\n\nBy becoming a stronghold of conservative forces, the Senate guaranteed the blocking of any radical Duma bills aimed at changing the status quo, and at the same time guaranteed the irremovability of Kerensky's power. Kerensky consolidated his power, but a sharp shift toward authoritarianism increased resistance to his rule in the Duma. The leader of the Socialist-Revolutionary party, Chernov, agreed to maintain the coalition only for the sake of stabilizing the situation, hoping for free elections and that sooner or later the Socialist-Revolutionaries would be able to implement their policies."

russia.1023.t: "A Troubled History: Stabilisation and Decay"
russia.1023.d: "After the upheavals of the Kolchak putsch and the radicalization of society, however, the situation has somewhat stabilized - both in the village and in the city. Yields increased, German technology brought mechanization and new fertilizers, and large cities began to develop industry. In 1927, the Social Revolutionaries won the elections again and re-formed a government with the Kadets, and in 1928 Kerensky was again re-elected president. The status quo persisted.\n\nThis idyll and hopes for further stability were overshadowed by several factors. The first of these was the unfinished land reform, which continued to sow unrest among the peasants. The second is economic dependence on Germany due to the Minsk Agreement and high tariffs. The third is the authoritarian bias of Kerensky, who had to make more and more concessions to the Senate.\n\nWith the hope of reducing dependence on German capital, the conservatives suggested that Kerensky should begin a policy of protectionism aimed at developing domestic production. The state reduced trade with Germany, which in the short term led to a rapid growth of industry, but soon turned into a failure due to the reduction of important supplies of German equipment. In an attempt to combat German influence, the government began inefficient and expensive imports of basic necessities from the United States.\n\nThis policy eventually led to the closure of most German businesses and increased unemployment. In 1929, the economic crisis in the United States led to the fact that short-term loans issued to Russian companies were withdrawn. This led to the collapse of the Russian economy, which was now left without most of the German enterprises and without American loans. Kerensky had no choice but to return to negotiations with Germany. At the Berlin Conference of 1930, Kerensky literally begged for the new loans from Germany, further strengthening German influence than before the policy of protectionism. All this, in general, led to a sharp increase in the popularity of Bukharin's NSP and Savinkov's NRPR."

russia.1024.t: "A Troubled History: Radicalization"
russia.1024.d: "Bukharin's People's Socialist Party was in a semi-legal position. On the one hand, fearing any manifestations of socialist discontent, Kerensky did not prohibit the activities of the 'New Bolsheviks'. On the other hand, the high threshold for passing to the Duma prevented the presence of any noticeable number of deputies from the NSP.\nThe popularity of the NRPR was very high. They had no flaw in their connection with the Bolsheviks, like Bukharin, and Savinkov was a respected figure during the Civil War.\n\nThe 1932 elections marked the beginning of the end of Kerensky's rule. Savinkov's party was able to overtake the Socialist-Revolutionaries in terms of the number of votes, and only a coalition of Kadets and Socialists-Revolutionaries, once again lobbied by Kerensky, was able to save the situation.\n\nRealizing the power of his influence, Savinkov began to actively promote his own ideas. Being a revolutionary and a supporter of terrorism, he creates the paramilitary wing of the party - the Combat Squads of the NRPR, aimed at a radical solution to the 'Kerensky problem'.\n\nOf course, this could not please the other parties in the Duma, who now saw Savinkov's party as a direct threat to democracy, nor Kerensky and the Senate, who saw Savinkov's party as a direct threat to their power.\n\nThe last years of the republic from 1932 to the present were largely devoted to the fight against radicalism within society: mass events were banned, and Kerensky strengthened anti-terrorist measures. The actual declaration of war was the violent dispersal of an anti-government demonstration of the people's Republicans by the police on the anniversary of the February Revolution in 1934. Attempts on senators and ministers became more frequent, and Kerensky began to think seriously about dissolving the Duma and banning Savinkov's party. However, to do this, he needed the help of the army - and with the commander-in-chief, Lavr Kornilov, he had strained relations, not to mention the more conservative officers who were still convinced monarchists. In 1935, workers ' strikes and clashes between socialists and People's Republicans became more frequent. In November 1935, Kerensky survived an armed attack, and who knows - maybe it will happen again."

russia.2.t: "The Russian Constitution of 1920"
russia.2.d: "Signed in 1920, after the end of the Russian Civil War and three years after the February Revolution, the Constitution of the Russian Republic is a scar of the fractured White movement which saw its adoption. According to the Constitution, Russia, the Russian Democratic Federative Republic, is a democratic parliamentary federation of both national and territorial autonomous oblasts.\nThe legislative branch consists of the State Duma, elected every five years, and the Senate.\n\nIn some ways, the Constitution is an updated version of the Tsarist constitution of 1906 - the upper house of the Parliament, the Senate, is the main example of this authoritarian heritage. It is an institution composed of 150 senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations, 50 of whom are appointed by the regional legislatures, 50 - by the president and 50 - elected by the people with sufficient age (30 years) and higher education or social status (former aristocracy) or personal wealth. The lower house, the State Duma, is elected and holds most of the legislative power in the country. The presence of the unelected Senate curbs democratic process in the country, however.\n\nThe executive branch is divided into the office of President, elected every four years by the Senate, and the Council of Ministers. The Prime-Minister is the head of government, chosen by the Parliament and appointed by President. The Speaker of the Senate is chosen by the Senate and becomes acting president should the President become unable to serve. The new President is elected only after the term of the elected President comes to end.\n\nThe President is the primary actor in executing legislative acts and represents the Republic in foreign affairs. He also has access to the infamous Article 48 of the Constitution, which allows the President to take emergency actions without the approval of the Duma. President Alexander Kerensky has grown fond of using this power to bypass the increasingly fractured legislature and thus pass decrees and laws.\n\nDrafted under the guidance of the White Generals, the Constitution can only call itself a protector of democracy when its articles are not used against it."

russia.2017.t: "The Economic State of Russia"
russia.2017.d: "After the end of the Civil War, the government attempted to rebuild the economy using a combination of socialist economic theories and the proposals of the Kadets and their supporters among Russian capitalists. In order to restore the economy after the civil war, Russia introduced Chervonets - gold-backed rubles, which were to replace kerenkas, sovznaks and securities, which were not trusted by the population. It was decided that the country's economic and financial policy should be oriented towards restoring gold backed money. While the gold reserve of the Russian Empire, which had been under the control of Kolchak during the Civil War and then transferred to Petrograd, was insufficient to cover all economic expenditures, the Сhervonets was greeted with confidence by the population and were seen as a non-monetary security rather than a means of circulation. Many people expected that the exchange of paper chervonets for gold would be free, and these hopes were realized. As a result, the exchange rate of the chervonets remained stable, which gave solid ground for stabilization of the economy, increased investor confidence in the Russian market and active investment by other countries in the industrialization of the country. On the other hand, it strengthened German influence - after all, the German mark was also tied to the Gold Standard.\n\nThe land reform finally adopted by the Duma in 1925 proved insufficient to satisfy the interests of the various social groups. Despite attempts at compromise, contradictions between left and right parties persisted, and agriculture faced problems of instability and peasant discontent. Misunderstandings between industry and the countryside persist, and among former owners and small peasant households there is persistent discontent with land reform. Industry did not achieve full efficiency due to poor management and limited financial resources, industrialization was slow, and the energy sector was heavily dependent on foreign investment. In addition, because of the Riga Accords of 1930, Russia fell into a strong economic dependence on Germany, which created risks and influenced domestic policy decision-making. The Russian economy in 1936 faces serious difficulties due to limited domestic resources, political instability, and foreign dependence. Industry and the electric power sector were struggling to reform, and agriculture required a more balanced approach. Solving these problems requires not only internal reforms, but also a stronger position in foreign relations."

russia.3.d: "During the Berlin Conference in November 1935, the Germans forced us to repay the remaining part of the Weltkrieg war indemnities (agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk treaty in 1918) one year earlier than expected, which has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than to impose harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support. Our citizens were already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets and Socialist Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Alexander Kerensky, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."

russia.4.d: "With the stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions for our citizens during 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash. The only available option to amass sufficient capital to help our economy, was to force the Russian state to prematurely repay the remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Berlin conference in November 1935 president Alexandr Kerensky, together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov, were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastic austerity measures the Russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."

In the Admiralty Hospital of Emperor Peter the Great in St. Petersburg, a team of doctors tried to save his life all night. They succeeded. But unfortunately, the president was in a coma. And until he woke up, the government of the country was in the hands of other people. The newspapers were silent all day, the president's condition was not reported. Only high-ranking officials knew about him, who were not ready to declare the president's condition for the time being.

Another attempt to assassinate the president, the payment of new compensations to Germany, as well as the mysterious disappearance of the murderer from the crime scene made people really worry about the state of affairs. In addition, President Kerensky was still in a coma and there were no statements from officials. Newspapers popular among the townspeople described the attack on Kerensky in colors - some wrote that they had caught the president in the act, and he was wounded, bleeding, lying surrounded by guards and the crowd, waiting for medical help. \n\nOther newspapers popular among the opposition described the attack on Kerensky as an attempt by a madman to end the life of a traitor who sold the country to Germany for loans and investments. The assassin's bullet was described almost as an arrow of liberation from the oppression of the oligarchs given by the Lord himself. And the hand of Gorgulov, unwavering before an attempt to take a person's life, symbolized the punitive hand of popular justice - a deserved lynching of a tyrant. \n\nMeanwhile, the lack of news forced citizens, mainly workers of the Putilov plant, to declare a strike of thousands and take to the streets of the city demanding freedom from the tyranny of capital, saving the country from poverty. On the other hand, a crowd of Savinkov's supporters, radically opposed to socialism, with slogans about true people's freedom under the leadership of a hero Vozhd, was coming towards them."

russia.15.d: "In the twilight of his remarkable life, Alexander Guchkov, the distinguished statesman, and adventurer, has bid farewell to the mortal realm at the age of 73. Hailing from a background uncharacteristic of the conservative politicians of his era, Guchkov, born in Moscow, bore a lineage entwined with the fabric of Old Believers, while his mother was French. Guchkov's academic pursuits led him through Moscow State University, where he delved into history and humanities. However, the sedentary nature of scholarly life failed to satiate his active and adventurous spirit. Embarking on a journey, he traversed Mongolia to western Siberia on horseback, encountering perilous situations that forged his reputation as a daredevil. His penchant for risk manifested in volunteering for the Boer army during the Second Boer War, where he faced wounds and captivity, adding yet another chapter to his storied life. An integral figure in the tumultuous times of the Russian Revolution of 1905, Guchkov avoided doctrinaire groupings, choosing a path that advocated military reform. Guchkov's role as Chairman of the Duma's Committee of Imperial Defence during the Russo-Japanese War showcased his commitment to the welfare of Russian soldiers.\n\nHowever, as the winds of change swept across Russia, the Octobrists, led by Guchkov, found themselves on shifting ground. His resignation as Speaker of the Duma reflected a waning faith in peaceful evolution of the Tsardom. Linked to the intrigues surrounding Rasputin, Guchkov's political career was further complicated by the outbreak of the Weltkrieg. Having led the Red Cross on the German front, he later became a key figure in the Central Committee of War Industries. His participation in the Progressive Bloc and revolutionary sentiments were the prelude to the seismic events of the February Revolution of 1917. Guchkov's influence persisted in Russia's subsequent Provisional Government, where he served as Minister of War until he was forced to resign amid public unrest. After the Bolshevik Revolution, he provided financial support to the White Guards, joining efforts to constitutionally restore the monarchy. As Russia bids farewell to this multifaceted figure, Alexander Guchkov leaves behind a legacy marked by indelible imprints of adventurism and statesmanship."

However, this ban was easily circumvented by creating organizations in the name of non-convicted supporters \"sympathizing with the Bolsheviks\", or by creating proxy lists of candidates for elections. At the moment, the most popular such proxy party is the \"People's Socialist Party\" of Nikolay Bukharin and his supporters - Lev Kamenev, Aleksey Rykov and others. On the eve of the elections, the government once again considered the possibility of creating all sorts of obstacles for this proxy list in order not to let them into parliament, as before.

russia.21.d: "At present, in the context of the political crisis, it is virtually impossible to take any elaborate measures to de-escalate the economic depression. The Economic Council of the Russian Parliament has nevertheless developed two plans for emergency anti-crisis measures. One plan, proposed mainly by conservative senators and liberals, implied a protectionist approach that should keep the state from interfering in the economy by attracting private domestic investment, both voluntary and forced through taxes. Additionally, it is proposed to reintroduce the floating Ruble before inflation turns it into worthless paper. The plan proposed by the Socialists and the People's Republicans calls for immediate state intervention in the economy - with priority nationalization of unprofitable German companies and key industries, as well as subsidizing agriculture to prevent a collapse in the countryside.\n\nThe two plans have something in common - the abandonment of the Chervonets, introduced 15 years ago to stabilize the economy by adopting the gold standard. As there is no time for ranting and debate, any plan will be adopted by all chambers of the parliament, despite the politicians' differences."

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk has been paraded as an example of a punitive treaty since its inception, but only now has Russia gotten confident enough to consider repudiating it. Printing presses are publishing maps and treatises where Russia's western neighbours are declared 'German-occupied Western Territories' and the locals living there are described as suffering, awaiting the return of Mother Russia. This is one issue which can unite the Russian right, left and centre, though for different reasons. Russian nationalists obviously seek revenge against Germany, whereas the leftists see Germany as the hegemon which prevents the rise of socialism and Syndicalism in Europe.\n\nNo matter what regime may be in charge, they will need to place the reconquest of Russia's western territories at the top of the priority list. Few want to see Russia start this war, however. The general line of thought among the Russian populace, intellectuals and politicians is that Russia needs to wait. Observe. And descend like a hawk when Germany is focused elsewhere. Cunning has saved Russia in countless wars before, and this moment will be no different."

Her military industry has been neglected and her economy is not yet ready to out-produce the West. Though Russia holds massive potential, many sacrifices will have to be made before we will be able to repudiate the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Which is why these sacrifices have been proposed. The government has been introduced a bill for national rearmanent, including austerity policies and the expansion of state owned arms production enterprises, even if they will come at a cost."

russia.24.d: "After the end of the Civil War in 1920, Russia was in a state of ruin. In 1925, the new government formed by SRs and Kadets set itself the ambitious task of electrifying the country. The government introduced measures for state regulation of private energy companies as a part of privatisation of the industry. Companies that failed to fulfill state orders could be nationalized, which stimulated the fulfillment of obligations and improvement of the quality of services. High customs tariffs and low taxes attracted foreign investment even more.\n\nThe once pioneer of Russian energy sector, the German company Siemens-Halske and the Deutsche Bank received their share in the famous “Obschestvo-1886” (Society-1886), the first Russian electric company, established by Alexander III.\n\nThe following year several projects were launched to build district peat-fired power plants, called “Elektroperedachi” (Electric Transmission Plants), similar to the power plant in Bogorodsk near Moscow. At the same time, the electrification of railroads began, increasing the efficiency and speed of freight and passenger transportation. With the arrival of German investment and technology, the pace of electrification accelerated, and by 1928, the government began actively building hydroelectric power plants on the Volga river, which increased electricity production. By 1934, most of Russia was electrified. Major industrial and agricultural regions had access to electricity. However, problems also arose - economic dependence on foreign investment made the energy sector vulnerable to external economic shocks. As a result, when Berlin Stock Exchange collapsed, Russia, much of whose economy depended on German investment, was plunged into chaos. Siemens stopped their investments and froze many projects - and the government saw a perfect chance to nationalize all Siemens facilities in an absolutely legal way - failure to fulfill state orders."

Salvation from corruption, arrogance, lying officials, German domination, and the dominance of big capital. But in light of the assassin's personality, his fanaticism, his pseudoscientific and near-religious judgments, at least the leadership of the socialist parties realized that the president's death only threw Russia into chaos. With the collapse of the ruling coalition and the resignation of the government, it became at least obvious to the leadership of the NSP, PLSR and RSDRP that liberal ministers and SRs were not capable of pulling Russia out of chaos in this situation. And only elections, fair and honest, are capable. It is necessary to take power into their own hands, and to demand fair conditions. \n\nWith these thoughts, in major cities a strike of workers was organized, demanding an immediate increase in wages and working conditions. The so-called \"Popular Front\" of the left-wing socialist parties also turned to political demands - the formation of a unified socialist government and the legalization of radical left-wing parties in order to save Russia from the dictatorship and terror that, in their opinion, the extreme right-wing deputies were going to carry out. \n\nAppealing to the mind of the SR ministers still capable of influencing something, referring to the socialist bills and promises stifled by Kerensky, the Popular Front hoped for the prudence of the SR lobby and satisfaction of both economic and political demands.\n\nHowever, the strikes had already degenerated into haphazard and unorganized chaos. Some of the more radical workers had shifted from slogans of socialist democracy to calls to overthrow the government by force and establish Soviet rule without waiting for any elections. Against this background, the SRs are under tremendous pressure. The wrong decision could wreak havoc not only in Russia, but also in the party itself."

Residents of the city could watch from their windows as a huge crowd of radical activists closed in on the procession. In the vanguard of the procession were BO fighters, carrying banners reading \"Down with the Liberal Ministers\" ('Doloy Ministrov Liberalov') and \"Let's Restore Russia's Greatness\" ('Vosstanovim Velichie Rossii'). \n\nBoris Savinkov himself was seen leading the march, along with his associate and part-time head of the BO, Viktor Abakumov, who led the fighters. It was not long before the People's Republicans reached the square in front of the Winter Palace, where Savinkov addressed the assembled activists, fighters, and onlookers from the rostrum. He gave a fiery speech to his supporters, calling for the immediate banning of all socialist parties, the arrest of provocateurs and trade union leaders, and a \"People's Tribunal\" on the Kadets and the SRs, the ministers who had allowed chaos in the country. However, this was not the end.\n\nThe heated crowd took Savinkov's calls to heart, and some of the most radicalized citizens marched to the Field Of Mars, where a socialist rally was being held. It was becoming clear that soon the city risked becoming the center of violent unrest, which should not be allowed to happen in any case. However, it was unclear whether the increased contingent of police detachments would be able to cope. The responsibility placed on the shoulders of the government is greater than ever. The negotiators from the Winter Palace reported to the government that Savinkov had given an ultimatum to ban the activities of the Socialist parties within a short time and officially report this to the population by radio. Only then did he vow to stop the march and prevent bloodshed in the city."

russia.32.d.accept_sav: "The government decided to give in to Savinkov's ultimatum, and has announced that in order to prevent another Revolution, the activities of RSDRP, PLSR and NSP are hereby outlawed. However, the police has also surrounded Palace Square, limiting the violent crowd's ability to head toward the Field of Mars. Under the onslaught of the police, the NRPR supporters were surrounded on the square. The radio broadcast demanded that the protesters immediately disperse to their homes. Despite all the opposition from the police, clashes could not be avoided. Some of the nationalist-minded crowd was still able to leave the police barrier and reach Field Of Mars. Despite their small number, they had a big scuffle with the socialists. On Palace Square, a number of protesters clashed with the police, demanding passage to the Field Of Mars.\n\nIt seems that the government had no choice but to try to negotiate with both sides at this point. And there can only be one compromise - fair elections, in which the strongest party will win. However, there is a more radical option - to involve the army. By appealing to the General Staff, the government could impose a curfew and martial law in Petrograd in order to disperse the demonstrations with the help of the army and bring stability back to the city."

russia.49.d: "Today in Moscow, the stronghold of Moscow Bolsheviks and their proxy party, a rally was held in response to a major strike at a Moscow factory. Despite the official ban on political activity, the leader of the party, Nikolay Bukharin, addressed the crowd. However, it was not the party itself that organized the event, but rather a 'list of workers' representatives', as they termed it.\n\nIn recent years, Bolsheviks have been using various names and strategies, but their participation in elections has been justified by the existence of \"workers' electoral lists\". These lists have provided them with a degree of support from workers and peasants, albeit in an unobtrusive manner.\n\nThis rally was particularly noteworthy as it was specifically organized for workers, despite the fact that peasants had recently become Bukharin’s primary constituency, owing to the reform agenda he crafted in collaboration with economist Nikolay Kondratiev. The representatives of the All-Russian Central Committee of Trade Unions (VTsSPS), including their leader, Solomon Lozovsky, an advocate of the Menshevik faction, were also in attendance.\n\nDespite the substantial divergence in ideologies between Menshevik and Bolshevik perspectives, Lozovsky nonetheless aligned himself with Bukharin, urging the masses to support the Popular Front, which he described as the sole avenue to workers' triumph in the forthcoming elections."

russia.50.t: "The Left SRs Boycott Elections"
russia.50.d: "Despite the fact that the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries has distanced itself from its left faction, which has evolved into the independent Party of Left SRs, the former still occasionally publishes articles in its newspapers authored by its erstwhile comrades on the left, such as Isaak Shteinberg, who some years ago published a lengthy article justifying the necessity of Russia's transformation to anarcho-syndicalism and the establishment of a syndicalist form of labour organisation, and the true power of the Soviets, of course, now preserved only at the level of villages and small towns. The new publication, published almost immediately following the initial editorial process, was dedicated to the call for a boycott of elections by the Left SRs.\n\nBoris Kamkov and Maria Spiridonova have once again urged all true adepts of socialism, Narodism, and other revolutionary ideologies to abstain from participating in the upcoming elections. They themselves have declined to submit their own lists.\n\nWhile a number of prominent figures associated with the left SR movement, such as Isaak Shteinberg and Vladimir Trutovsky, have consistently advocated for the support of both the right PSR and the Mensheviks, they have yet to achieve a decisive majority within the Central Committee of the PLSR. Consequently, the Central Committee maintains its revolutionary stance and calls upon all workers and peasants to establish mass soviets across the nation, aiming to dismantle the grip of the bourgeois class and capitalism. And although this excerpt has been carefully excised from the published manifesto by the conscientious editor-in-chief of the SR newspaper with the aim of avoiding unnecessary attention from the law enforcement authorities, the stance of the PLSR remains transparent to many."

russia.53.a: "I will have a look."

russia.54.t: "Choosing the Army Reform Plan"
russia.54.d: "Our military now is not in a good condition. It has not been reformed for a long time since the Weltkrieg. Not only have we divided military staff, but there's a huge lack of equipment. Field marshal Denikin is popular with the politicians and most of our officer corps. To go through with his plans for the army would be an easy affair. He suggests that Russia should rely on our huge numbers to win any future wars, but also insists that a motorisation of our forces is necessary. Wrangel, while not as widely respected as Denikin, is still popular with some parts of the military. He believes in discipline and is respected far and wide for his administrative abilities. With extensive planning and a general motorisation, he believes he can make the Russian army the greatest in the world! Shatilov is a veteran from both the front lines and the staff quarters. While not the first choice of the Military command he does have a circle of close allies who all advocate theories of overwhelming firepower, hammering enemy positions with artillery before attacking. Additionally, more initiative and responsibility needs to be given to the officer at the front-line. And finally, no one doubts the talents of Markov, put to display in every war since the Russo-Japanese one. During the Weltkrieg he was a close assistant to Denikin. However, his ideas are foreign to many of the general staff of Russia and it might take some persuading to get everyone on board with his plans about doctrine of quick war: Russian tank armies, swift strikes through enemy lines. The choice we make today has to be considered carefully and thoroughly, for it will influence the shape of our military for years to come."

The same reform has been made by Bolsheviks in their \"The Decree On Land\" and later by Kerensky. However, the reform was not brought to a conclusion, as most of the land in urban regions is mostly private in hands of wealthy landowners.

Despite all the efforts of the police to catch the criminal, he managed to cover his tracks. The official position of the leader of the NRPR, Boris Savinkov, is that the criminal was expelled from the party and that he acted alone, without coordinating his actions with the leadership in any way. While the police are on the prowl, Kerensky is still in a coma, and it is unknown how this may end."

russia.104.d: "Joyful news has been received today in all the newspapers of the country - President Kerensky has come out of a coma, feels well and is aware of everything around him. He will be ready to return to work in the coming days. \n\nHowever, a terrible political and economic crisis has flared up in the country over the past month, and the idea of returning the old politician to his former place has not found a wide response in the eyes of people. Presidential elections are coming in June 1936, and it is obvious that Kerensky will be appointed president again. If he cannot deal with the situation in the country, the situation will worsen."
russia.104.a: "Brief the President about the situation!"

This body includes people close to the president who should come up with a plan in the near future and begin active actions to improve the situation in the country. Of course, the president will have the final word.\n\nMany have already opposed the creation of the Committee, calling it an unconstitutional and illegal entity that alienates real power from the legitimately elected parliament. However, so far, these are only the objections of people whose opinion does not solve anything."

russia.106.t: "Choosing Our Focus"
russia.106.d: "With the Committee finally established, we must choose our main aim for the 6 month. While many of Kerensky's advisors now suggest to focus on fighting terrorists, bringing back stability and peace to the republic, the others suggest that we should deal with the Economy problems first. The healthier our economy is - the more stable is the society. However, there is also a third faction, that suggests that we should modernize our army."

russia.107.t: "At the Negotiating Table"
russia.107.d: "Today, the President of the Republic will hold meetings together with the leaders of the PSR, RSDRP and KDP parties, as well as Prime Minister Pavel Milyukov. \n\nFor the consideration of the audience, the President presented a proposal to create a united anti-radical coalition to solve the political and economic crisis in the country. Despite the fact that the PSR and the Kadets have long been in a single coalition, the addition of Mensheviks to them can significantly shift the ideology of the coalition to the left, which will lead to a more socialist composition of the next coalition. It is precisely these kinds of issues that the assembly should decide."
russia.107.a: "Let's talk!"

russia.108.t: "Nominating the New Prime-Minister"
russia.108.d: "The first and key issue that the audience should solve is the new Prime Minister of the country. At the moment, his position is occupied by Pavel Milyukov, for 20 years. On the part of the Kadets, this candidacy suits them, since Milyukov is a bright politician and ready to compromise.\n\nOn the other hand, President Kerensky has put forward a new candidate - the centrist SR Zenzinov, who is even more ideologically flexible, and is ready to yield even to the most liberal proposals of the Kadets and the most socialist proposals of the SRs. \n\nHowever, on the other hand, the Mensheviks advocated the most optimal option, in their opinion - Irakli Tsereteli, the main contender for the post of Prime Minister of the RSDRP. \n\nAny of the candidates, apparently, can suit everyone if they make concessions to the parties on other issues."
russia.108.a: "Zenzinov is a perfect candidate."
russia.108.b: "Tsereteli is a more balanced choice."
russia.108.c: "Milyukov is still the most prefered choice."

russia.109.t: "Question of Land"
russia.109.d: "It is not surprising that due to the unfinished land reform, this issue arose almost immediately. \n\nThe Social Revolutionaries did not hesitate for a minute to call for the immediate socialization of the land, simultaneously reminding Kerensky of his membership in the party and his long-standing promises to close the land issue. \n\nHowever, the socialization of the earth in modern realities is considered by the Kadets as a betrayal of the interests of other social strata, and they once again announced the rejection of the SR proposal. In return, they propose the creation of a National Agrarian Fund, which will subsidize private land farms of peasants, and encourage cooperatives.\n\nThe Mensheviks, in turn, have their own program of land reform: the so-called Agricultural Secure Council and Municipalization. According to their program, instead of socialization, the land shall be given to local municipal councils, with a Federal agency created in order to secure the municipal holdings."
russia.109.a: "Socialization of Land."

russia.110.d: "The initial agreements between the parties were reached and adopted, as a result of which today the Committee for the Salvation of the Republic announced the creation of a parliamentary and extra-parliamentary coalition \"The Democratic Bloc\", consisting of Social Revolutionaries, Kadets and Mensheviks, which will have to resist radical and conservative groups in the country. \n\nThis step, however, was critically perceived both by Savinkov's NRPR, which declared the monopolization of power by corrupt Democrats, and by Senators and Deputies from the VNS, who were one of the guarantors of Kerensky's irremovability of power in exchange for concessions to the aristocracy and oligarchy. It seems that with the creation of a new coalition, Kerensky's unspoken alliance with Dmitry Romanov, the speaker of the Senate, has come to an end."

russia.111.a: "Coalition talks fail!"

russia.112.t: "Expanding the Powers of the Senate"
russia.112.d: "The Duma is nothing but a strange mix of people with radically different views that argue how should our president govern the country. Kerensky was one of the first to understand that parliamentarism is an alien value, imposed by failed Canadian and French governments. Their parliamentarism led to socialist revolutions. With the dissolution of Duma as an useless holdover from the old days, we should empower the Senate - assembly of nobles, aristocrats, academicians and the most prominent Russian citizens."
russia.112.a: "The Senate should be the only legislative body."

russia.113.t: "The End of the Russian Democracy"
russia.113.d: "All the power has been finally consolidated in the hands of one man - the only deserving candidate - President Kerensky. With the Duma dissolved, martial law invoked and state of emergency declared, nothing can stop Kerensky from achieving the ultimate goal - becoming the eternal president. Every sensible citizen understands - that both socialists and nationalist will ruin the country or drag it into war; and parliamentarism will lead to constant debates about simple solutions. While almost handling the power of an absolute Tsar, Kerensky will wisely govern, continuing to keep order in a falling apart Empire."

russia.118.d: "Today on [GetDateText] the leader of NSP was arrested for terrorism. The judicial session will be held the next day, but there's no doubt that Bukharin will be given a life sentence for terrorism and treason against the fatherland."

russia.118.b: "What if we just kill him?"

russia.119.t: "Savinkov Arrested"
russia.119.d: "5 hours before [GetDateText] the agents of Okhranka arrested Mr. Savinkov, leader of NRPR party. He is accused of establishing and sponsoring a paramilitary organisation which committed crimes against citizens of Russia. The judicial session will be held tomorrow and it is expected that Savinkov will be sentenced for life."
russia.119.a: "He will have a lot of time to write another 'Memoirs of a Terrorist.'"
russia.119.b: "Maybe we should kill him?"

russia.120.t: "State of Emergency Declared"
russia.120.d: "Today Alexander Kerensky, the President of Russia has announced state of emergency in connection with radicalisation of social spirits. He states that the state of emergency will be active until all causes of destabilization will be eradicated. Since today the "Decree №121" will go into operation. Elections will be postponed, freedom of assembly is temporarily banned as well."

russia.121.d: "According to the Constitution elections are to be held every five years. The VII Duma has been dissolved due to the end of its term and the time has come to elect a new parliament."

russia.121.b: "Liberal Opposition wins!"
russia.121.c: "Conservative Opposition wins!"
russia.121.e: "Kerensky’s Coalition wins once again!"
russia.121.f: "Savinkov wins a landslide victory!"

russia.1210.t: "Kerensky Retires!"
russia.1210.d: "After the shameful defeat at the recent elections, President Kerensky has voluntarily retired from his office. It is likely that the President won't be elected as soon as possible, but the government already plans to appoint the new president in a few months."
russia.1210.a: "The end of Kerenskyism!"

russia.122.t: "Remnants of Radicalism"
russia.122.d: "Despite the fact that both NSP and NRPR are now eliminated, some of their elements are still active. We should be sure that never ever our country and citizens will suffer from terrorism."
russia.122.a: "Sounds like a witch hunt."

russia.123.t: "Dissolving State Duma"
russia.123.d: "State Duma is now nothing, but an obstacle to Kerensky's rule. NRPR is the second largest party in the Duma and it should be dealt with. New elections will be announced and we'll make sure that Kerensky's party secures the majority."
russia.123.a: "State Duma is a nonsense"

russia.124.t: "Emergency Powers of President Kerensky"
russia.124.d: "During these harsh times it became obvious that the country need a strong hand. President Kerensky has been with our country, struggling for its independence and prosperity since 1917 and he precisely knows what to do to save Russia. In this case, the Committee For the Salvation of Republic has announced that during the state of emergency, President Kerensky has emergency powers to form the government and dismiss its ministers, dissolve the Duma, and to appoint the Speaker of the Senate."
russia.124.a: "Glory to Kerensky!"

russia.125.t: "Eternal President"
russia.125.d: "Our country has seen elevations and depressions since the Weltkrieg. But the only man who was able to secure the stability and freedom of our citizens, the only one who was able to fight radicals and save Russia from terrorism is our great President, Mr. Kerensky. He has survived many assassination attempts, and we, people of Russia, are immensely grateful for that."
russia.125.a: "Long Live President Kerensky!"

russia.126.t: "Expanding Presidential Powers"
russia.126.d: "Why some may argue that Kerensky already has a lot of power, he is appointed by the Senate, and therefore his power depends on it. We shall empower our president so he won't become a puppet of the Senate and can easily defend himself. While currently 3/5 of the Senate should vote for the candidate in order to appoint him as a president, this proportion should be changed to 4/5. Moreover, the President candidacy shall be approved by the Government. By achieving this Constitutional reform, President will become stronger - and our country will become more powerful."
russia.126.a: "President is all we need."

russia.127.t: "Empower Duma"
russia.127.d: "Only in pluralism, in ability to agree and disagree is the real power. The State Duma ensures that our country is a real bastion of democracy."

russia.128.t: "Innocent Man Tortured To Death!"
russia.128.d: "Today all newspapers report that they have evidence that Kerensky has personally ordered to torture an innocent man who is believed to be an NSP agent. The fact that Kerensky's government brings about repressions against Russian citizens because of their political views."
russia.128.a: "How did they know that?"

russia.129.t: "NSP's Safehouse Found"
russia.129.d: "Thanks to the information that Bukharin's contact voluntarily told us, we found the safehouse of NSP revolutionaries. Okhranka tells that several rifles and self-made bombs were discovered. However, we still look for Bukharin himself."
russia.129.a: "Mission Completed"

russia.130.t: "Anti-government Protests in [Root.Capital.GetName]"
russia.130.d: "The state of emergency, declared by Kerensky, led to mass protests in [Root.Capital.GetName]. People are protesting against restriction of their rights and freedoms. It seems, that the rule of Kerensky is as shaky as it was never before."
russia.130.a: "Let them protest."
russia.130.b: "The police will disperse the crowd."

russia.131.t: "The Protesters Demand Kerensky's Retirement"
russia.131.d: "The Protesters demand Kerensky to retire. They claim that they do not need uneffective president who cannot respect their freedoms and rights and save the country from economic crisis. Now we have two choices only: to give in the demands of the protesters or to declare state of emergency."
russia.131.a: "Kerensky should retire. Now!"
russia.131.b: "Declare state of emergency!"
russia.131.c: "Deploy army in the city."

russia.132.t: "Shooting Incident in Petrograd"
russia.132.d: "We managed to make the fur fly as Combat Squads and NSP entered an open fight. Tonight there was a shooting incident in Petrograd. It was dark night when several shots were heard. The police arrived just at the time when Combat Squads and NSP Revolutionaries started to shoot each other. As a result of a skirmish, several police officers were wounded, two were killed. The Okhranka arrived too late only to see about 15 dead bodies. Street firing can now justify our measures against paramilitary organisations that destabilize Russian society."
russia.132.a: "Ban Combat Squads."

russia.133.t: "Savinkov Found Dead"
russia.133.d: "While waiting for the judicial session, Savinkov was left alone in the investigatory isolation ward. Those who secured him suddenly noticed that Savinkov slowly dropped on his knees foaming at the mouth. The doctors were called immediately but they only have to state the death. The Vozhd of Peasants has committed suicide."
russia.133.a: "He should have been in jail!"

### Non-Kerensky events ###
russia.134.t: "Assassination of Maria Spiridonova"
russia.134.d: "During a meeting of the Left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov's Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Social Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov dyarchy."
russia.134.a: "Thus unto all enemies of the state!"
leftists_purged: "Maria Spiridonova is dead"

russia.135.t: "The Myth of October"
russia.135.d: "'The whole question of Russia's existence depends on our understanding the true nature of Bolshevism and the nature of its supporters. We have to open our eyes to the fact that Bolshevism is a global threat, not just local Russian disease. That's exactly the reason why we should identify all its supporters and limit their influence to the life of the Russian Republic.' - with these words the main ideologist of the Russian "National Renewal" Dmitriy Merezhkovsky explained the revocation of the right to vote as well as the part of the other civil rights for the members of the Bolshevik party and some former Soviet officials. With this measure, Boris Savinkov and NRPR are going to improve the situation in the Russian society and get rid of all these elements, who undermine the stability of Russia.\n\nThe October putsch, called a Revolution by some, left Russia changed forever. This means that it is very easy to blame Russia's faults and weaknesses not on inaction, not on the failures of the current government, but on the Bolsheviks who supposedly ruined it all - and the NRPR is sure to take advantage of this myth. History textbooks are being amended, a mass propaganda campaign started, and the message sent that the Bolshevik uprising was not just an ordinary uprising. An international conspiracy, one which sought to destroy holy Russia and make sure it never rises again, was responsible for funding the Bolshevik Party and supplying their uprising across central Russia, and were it not stopped by force of arms, it would have left Russia broken, destroyed and shattered. These textbooks make sure to note the fact that Vladimir Lenin had been sent to Petrograd by the Germans, and that many of the leading members of the Bolshevik Party were not Russian - Caucasians, Balts, Poles, and especially Jews."
russia.135.a: "You wanted to revoke our rights in 1917, but now you will lose yours."

russia.136.t: "Vox Populi"
russia.136.d: "Boris Kamkov, pre-1917 Savinkov's ally and later one of his main enemies, who had became the leader of the Left SRs after the assassination of Maria Spiridonova, died this night in Moscow. It happened when Savinkov's Combat Squads broke into the house, where an illegal Left SR meeting took place, and Kamkov, trying to escape, jumped in the Moscow River and drowned. According to the famous sarcastic writer Ivan Bunin, the 'vox populi' about this incident seems to be sneers or indifference - just like Savinkov and the NRPR want."
russia.136.a: "Farewell Boris, farewell Boris, I'll see you in my dreams."

russia.137.t: "The Great Crusade"
russia.137.d: "'I'm so delighted with the events of January 1936, with the great heroic deed of the Knight, who raised with his hand the sword to kill the Devil. I believe that this struggle will be continued and our Vozhd will revenge for all these young heroes, who were cowardly killed by the lefts. This struggle must finish with our victory.' - Ivan Shmelyov, Russian conservative writer, whose unarmed son was killed by the Reds at the end of the civil war, demands that Russian government should continue to fight against the left movements, such as Left SRs and Mensheviks not only in Moscow and Petrograd, but also in the various Russian regions. Though these parties were incredibly weakened by special government measures after Savinkov's rise to power and the killing of Maria Spiridonova and Boris Kamkov, their leaders in Russian regions definitely should be arrested and even executed, if necessary."
russia.137.a: "Russia won't be a syndicalist country. Never."

russia.138.t: "The Purge"
russia.138.d: "Though thousands have already been summarily executed and many more arrested for real or suspected crimes, Savinkov's paranoia has not been satiated. Enemies still lurk at every corner to him and the Syndicalists may come for his head any moment now. This is where one of the rising stars in the National Republican Party and the Deputy Minister of Interior, Viktor Abakumov, stepped in to offer a solution. To ensure that the Vozhd's rule is forever solid and his regime lasts a thousand years, the Russian nation must learn to fear, and above all else, its enemies must learn to fear.\n\nAbakunov's brainchild is a purge not from the top down, done via orders to arrest this dissident or that dissident, but instead from the bottom up. All regional governors need to be given quotas of "enemies of the state" they need to find, extract, and purge. Those who do not deserve a bullet to the back of the head should work off their debt instead - the Tsarist Okhrana laid the groundwork for deporting thousands of dissidents to Siberia, but this system can be modernized, industrialized, and turned into an archipelago of destruction. Even those who are not plotting against Russia must know their place - Abakunov offers to incentivize ratting out possible enemies of the state in workplaces, schools or even families, creating an atmosphere of worry and uncertainty under which the masses will flock to the only thing which can keep them safe, loyalty to the Vozhd.\n\nEven fellow members of the NRPR believe that Abakumov's proposal is...crazy, but Savinkov has taken personal interest in the proposal."
russia.138.a: "This all sounds rather dreary..."
russia.138.b: "Just like we said. Through pain, a stronger Russia will rise."

russia.139.t: "Trial of the Left Separatists"
russia.139.d: "After the end of the Russian Civil War, some of the national minorities which fought on the side of the Soviets against the White Army continued to disobey the central government, not only through acts of terrorism, but also using the opportunity to take part in the local legislative authorities, where they often found support among the left movements, such as the Mensheviks and parts of the Left SRs. This movement of local nationalists became famous as the 'Left Separatists'. Though Boris Savinkov has accepted the new national policy, which should regulate and improve the relations between Russians and the Russian minorities, including groups disloyal to Petrograd, he cannot forget about the problem of the Left Separatists, which still exist even after the proscription of the Russian Left SR party and its allies. Thanks to our Ministry of Security, the leaders, active members and terrorists from the most notorious Left Separatist movements have been arrested and their property has been nationalised."
russia.139.a: "You fought the law and the law won!"

russia.140.t: "Fight Radicals"
russia.140.d: "Our government realizes that there are certain groups in the country that try to destabilize our society and use it to come to power. We should strengthen our internal security to prevent the bloodshed."
russia.140.a: "Stability is good."

### Back To Kerensky ###

russia.141.t: "Kerensky Arrested"
russia.141.d: "After illegal laws, passed by Kerensky, the citizens have rebelled against the oppresive rule of a paranoid President, who has once betrayed the country. His attempt to stop the protesters failed. Soon after the police and parts of army have joined the protest against current President. Later that day, Kerensky was arrested in his office for attempt to seize power in the country. But the future of the country is still unsolved."
russia.141.a: "Kornilov storms Moscow and seizes power."
russia.141.b: "Provisional Civilian Government established."

russia.142.t: "The Protesters Dispersed"
russia.142.d: "After illegal laws, passed by Kerensky, the citizens have rebelled against the oppresive rule of a paranoid President, who has once betrayed the country. His attempt to stop the protesters succeeded. The army and the police have successfully dispersed the crowd and Kerensky's rule was secured."
russia.142.a: "Kerensky secures the rule"

russia.143.d: "Kerensky was unable to secure his weak power across Russia. Today several high military commanders, under the leadership of Lavr Kornilov, with the help of Russian Army have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities."

russia.145.t: "Kerensky Re-Elected President"
russia.145.d: "The presidential term came to an end, and according to the agreements of President Kerensky with the Senate, he was re-elected for a new term.\n\nKerensky's last term from 1932 to the present has been largely devoted to the fight against radicalism within society: mass events were banned, and Kerensky strengthened anti-terrorist measures. Attempts on senators and ministers, workers' strikes and clashes between socialists and popular Republicans have become more frequent. In November 1935, Kerensky survived an armed attack, and then another one in January 1936. Since that moment, life in the country has changed.\n\nDuring the inauguration for a new term, Kerensky announced that the next 4 years would be different for the country. Terror and instability will be destroyed, the modernization of the army will be carried out, the policy of isolation in foreign policy will end due to the end of reparations payments under the Minsk Agreement, and the country will also come out of the terrible crisis of Black Monday. Kerensky promised that industrialization and the ultimte resolution of the land issue were waiting for the country."
russia.145.a: "4 More Years!"

russia.146.t: "Kerensky Ousted From Presidency"
russia.146.d: "The formation of a new parliamentary coalition with the participation of the Mensheviks, the conservative Senators, whom Kerensky himself appointed as guarantors of his irremovability, perceived as a violation of the agreements!\n\nBy a majority vote, the Senate voted against Kerensky's candidacy in favor of the current speaker of the Senate, Dmitry Romanov, a well-known lobbyist for the interests of the new Russian aristocracy and oligarchy. Kerensky was removed from his post, which means the beginning of a new era in Russia. As it became known from the evening newspapers, on the same day Kerensky left the country, leaving for Berlin, fearing arrest and imprisonment for anything that could be imputed to him. \n\nHowever, a new problem is brewing in the country, laid down by an imperfect constitution - elections to the Duma will take place only in a year, and it is unlikely that the newly elected president will be able to counteract it without abusing his veto right and dissolving the Duma."
russia.146.a: "The end of Eternal President!"

russia.147.t: "Dissolution of Duma"
russia.147.d: "With the new president taking the reins of power, the Senate-Duma Conflict was never so clear and evident. In this case, to deal with the political crisis, Dmitriy Romanov has enacted temporary state of emergency. Now, the choice to be made, is difficult and can define the future decades. Either President will call for early elections, or appoint a presidential government, willing to cooperate with him until the state of emergency will end, which is, as promised by the President, is until the next elections."
russia.147.a: "Russia needs a strong government!"
russia.147.b: "Call for early elections!"

russia.148.t: "Meeting the Senators"
russia.148.d: "During the meeting with Senators, Kerensky, in order to insure his victory in the presidential nomination in June, had to make a number of concessions to conservative senators, among whom, mainly, the new Russian aristocracy and wealthy entrepreneurs.  \n\nThe concessions proposed by the senators were lobbying for the interests of big business, subsidies for the development of industry by large enterprises, in particular, the Putilov Plant. The senators also demanded tax concessions.\n\nIn addition, in view of the last year of reparations payments to Germany, the senators demanded distancing from German capital and imposing additional taxes on German companies - a decision that Kerensky will have to make soon at a diplomatic conference in Berlin."
russia.148.a: "We have no choice for now."

russia.149.t: "Meeting the General Staff"
russia.149.d: "In the course of long reflections, Kerensky came to the conclusion that good relations with the General Staff oblige him to sit down at the negotiating table with Denikin and discuss the state of the army and ways to solve current problems.\n\nThe head of the armed forces since 1921 is General Lavr Kornilov, Kerensky's sworn enemy, but appointed to this position as a commitment of the Democrats to the White Armies. His hostility towards Kerensky for many years prevented an adequate dialogue between the authorities and the general Staff. Despite the fact that Denikin, nicknamed the peasant marshal, is the head of the general staff, he is also a member of the ROVS and is one of Kornilov's close associates.\n\nDuring the discussion with the generals, they made a proposal to immediately lobby for an increase in the country's military budget and the modernization of both the doctrine and equipment of the Russian troops. However, on the part of the army, in turn, Kerensky demanded not to hinder him in exercising his legitimate presidential power, and also announced his intention to declare a state of emergency in the country in connection with radicalism and terrorism, and use this provision to dissolve the Duma and strengthen his own power."
russia.149.a: "Something we should do now!"

russia.150.t: "Confronting Kornilov"
russia.150.d: "Since the Kornilov rebellion in 1917, Kerensky and Kornilov's relations have been not just strained, but hostile. However, when Kerensky gained a foothold in power, Kornilov was already commander-in-chief. Moreover, he did not support Kolchak's coup and remained loyal to the Republican system. His resignation in those years would have meant a betrayal of the victory of the White Armies. However, now everything has changed. Due to the agreements with the General Staff, Kerensky received guarantees from many generals, and the retirement of the elderly Kornilov was seen as something necessary. In addition, there were grounds to believe that Kornilov was connected with Savinkov and his party - Kerensky's main opponents in the political field. \n\nAccording to the Constitution, it is the President who appoints the head of the Russian Army, and, using his legal right, nothing prevents Kerensky from dismissing Kornilov and appointing Denikin's close associate, General Romanovsky, as commander-in-chief."
russia.150.a: "Leave him as the head of the army for the sake of stability"
russia.150.b: "Appoint Romanovsky the new Chief of Army!"

russia.152.t: "President Kerensky Shot!"
russia.152.d: "The sound of gunfire rings across the capital. Alexander Kerensky, the President of the Russian Republic was shot by an extremist while he was climbing the steps to the Senate House. The killer was shot by the police, however, his personality is hidden for now. Regardless, the fate of Russia has been irrevocably changed, for better or worse."
russia.152.a: "A shot that will ring across the world."

russia.153.t: "Rumors of Kerensky's Resignation?"
russia.153.d: "Recently, rumors began to circulate among Moscow saloons that the \"Eternal President\" Kerensky intended to resign and make way for his successor...\n\nMany suspect, however, that Kerensky is already so attached to the presidency that he has no intention of resigning of his own volition.\n\nHowever, as rumors began to spread rapidly through the major cities, Kerensky was approached directly by journalists to find out what he thought about the matter.\n\nAfter thinking for a while, and even with a barely perceptible sigh, Kerensky nevertheless declared loudly and resolutely:"
russia.153.a: "I am tired. I am leaving."
russia.153.b: "Another 4 years, ladies and gentlemen!"

russia.154.t: "Kerensky's Successor"
russia.154.d: "A few days after announcing his imminent resignation, Kerensky made a new appeal. He announced that the Senate had decided to terminate his powers early and that his successor until the next election would be Pitirim Sorokin, the famous Russian sociologist.\n\nHe became famous soon after the February Revolution, becoming editor of the central newspaper of the Social Revolutionaries, Volya Naroda, along with Breshko-Breshkovskaya, the \"Grandmother of the Russian Revolution\". He later became Kerensky's personal secretary and was elected to the Constituent Assembly.\n\nAfter the Civil War, Pitirim Sorokin became one of the senators from the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, which he was until the current moment. Though few had heard of him as a politician, Kerensky was convinced that it was the intelligent and bright minds who had the future, and only Sorokin would be able to accomplish what Kerensky had not fully succeeded."
russia.154.a: "An interesting choice..."

russia.200.t: "Attempt on the President’s life"
russia.200.d: "Today, during a military parade a crazed assassin tried to strike at President [RUS.GetLeader], this assassin was a man by the name of Sergey Taboritsky; who was killed before he could flee the scene. \n\n The assassination attempt was foiled in part due to the high security at the event, which came about as a result of previous assassinations of Russian Presidents. [RUS.GetLeader] survived the attack and the deranged assassin attempted to flee the scene on foot. However, before he could escape, he was killed by an 18th century ceremonial cannon, which was being used as a display piece before a vigilant guard used it to gun down the man who tried to kill the President.\n\n The cannon was fired into Taboritsky’s chest at point blank range, killing him instantly and reducing his body into a cloud of pulp and entrails. [RUS.GetLeader], while shocked at the attempt on his life continued attending the parade and even gave a speech at the end."
russia.200.a: "We need more security at these events..."

rusfor.52.d: "We've received a request today from [FROM.Capital.GetName] itself, they wish to invite us into a mutually beneficial military alliance. While [FROM.GetNameDef] certainly needs all the help it can get in these uncertain times we should also contemplate the risk of being brought into unwanted entanglements with other nations. How should we respond?"
rusfor.52.a: "We accept."
rusfor.52.b: "We want the return of our claims in exchange."

rusfor.53.d.refuse: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has outrageously refused our request to form an alliance, if they will not come to the dicussion table then war seems like the only solution to this problem. For now we will wait but mark our words, Russia will return!"
rusfor.53.a: "Magnificent!"
rusfor.53.b: "They are either crazy, or desire our territory. Probably both."

rusfor.54.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Aligns With Russia"
rusfor.54.d: "Important news has reached us today - [FROM.GetNameDef] has officially dissolved the Belgrade Pact, having announced an alliance with [RUS.GetNameDef]. It seems that while the Belgrade Pact was useful for containing regional threats in the Balkans, it would ultimately be unable to stand against the major powers in Western Europe by itself, hence [FROM.GetNameDef]'s decision to join the [RUS.GetFactionName]. The question to be asked now is if we follow them or strike our own path instead."
rusfor.54.a: "Ask to join Russia's sphere."
rusfor.54.b: "We will seek our own path, then."

rusfor.55.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Asks to Join Our Alliance"
rusfor.55.d.ROM: "Following the dissolution of the Belgrade Pact, [FROM.GetNameDef] has been left isolated , surrounded by many nations that have lukewarm relations with it at best. We have received a message from their embassy in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] today. Left with little alternative, the government of Bucharest has requested ‘cooperation’ between our two nations in military affairs. There is a condition attached to this however. In exchange for [FROM.GetAdjective] entry into the [ROOT.GetFactionName], we must officially renounce all claims to Bessarabia and the [FROM.GetAdjective] majority territories in Galicia. This is certainly a steep price for us to pay although the benefits are also significant - denying Germany one of its major oil suppliers as well as potentially gaining us a major ally in the Balkans. What should our reply be?"
rusfor.55.d.other: "Following [SER.GetNameDef] entry into the Russian Sphere, we have received a request from [FROM.GetNameDef], a former Belgrade Pact member.

rusfor.56.d: "We've received a response from [From.Capital.GetName] about our request for a military alliance today. After careful consideration, we have been declined entry into the Russian sphere, stating that our foreign policy and national goals simply did not align with theirs. It appears as though we will have to look elsewhere for assistance."
rusfor.56.a: "They are either crazy, or desire our territory. Probably both."

rusfor.58.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Desires the Return of their Lands"
rusfor.58.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has requested the transfer of any of their core lands currently held by Russia in exchange for their entry into the Moscow Accord. While accepting their request could strengthen our international position, the steep cost of giving away Russian land has caused opposition within our government who want to reject [From.GetNameDefCap]'s request for Russian land."
rusfor.58.a: "It's a worthy price."
rusfor.58.b: "These are rightful Russian lands!"

rusfor.59.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Accepts"
rusfor.59.d: "[Root.GetAdjective] diplomacy has proven to be successful today as [From.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to return our core lands in exchange for our entry into the Moscow Accord.

rusfor.60.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has shown its true colours as an enemy of [Root.GetName] and has refused to return our rightful land. There is no doubt now that diplomacy is impossible with the Russian bear and only war will be able to solve our issues."
rusfor.60.a: "As expected."

rusfor.61.t: "The Russian Academy of Sciences"
rusfor.61.d: "While the Moscow Accord and our membership within it is, theoretically, of a purely military nature, the reality is far more complex than that. One of the legacies of the Great War was the advent of mass mobilisation - the consolidation of large swathes of potentially useful sectors of society into an apparatus designed to aid the war effort. The field of technology was included in this - in the efforts to break the trench warfare of the Western Front, military technology created bold new inventions such as landships in the hopes of finally turning the tide. As result of mobilisation such as this, the line between civilian and military resources became somewhat blurred - and the recent growth of ever-present international tensions have ushered the start of a global arms race, something that nobody can afford to be left behind in.\n\nTo this end, the old and prestigious Russian Academy of Sciences has been given a new mandate by [RUS.GetNameDef] - the coordination of research efforts across Russia and her allies, and the swift dissemination of breakthroughs between them, particularly breakthroughs with potential military applications. As we are currently on very good terms with Russia, we have been extended an invitation to contribute talent to this program and share research between us and other participating nations. The potential boons that this could have for our technological development are, of course, obvious and plentiful."
rusfor.61.a: "Excellent."

rusfor.70.t: "Agreement of Russo-Finnish Friendship"
rusfor.70.d: "[From.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a surprising proposal. To ensure the safety of both St. Petersburg and [FIN.GetDefName] against ever-present German aggression, our two nations must put aside their disagreements and work together for safer Baltic region. The Russians are giving up any claims on our territory, if in exchange we ally them and agree to defend the region together, and not cede in to German pressure.\nThere is a thinly-veiled edge to their words, in almost a manner of presumed acceptance, but their offer seems genuine."
rusfor.70.a: "Quite a surprise, but a welcome one."
rusfor.70.b: "This is another of their plots. No!"

rusfor.71.t: "$rusfor.56.t$"

rusfor.104.d: "The Black Monday crisis has opened the possibility for Kalmyks to secede from the Don Republic peacefully. However, a recently established state of Kalmykia is too weak. We can try to seize a vital port of Astrakhan for us."
rusfor.104.a: "Use the chance to seize Astrakhan"
rusfor.104.b: "We are too weak ourselves now."

rusfor.105.d: "The Russian forces have crossed the border and engaged into open armed fights with our militia. The Russian government seeks to seize Astrakhan - a vital port of the Caspian, where the majority of our industry is located. Our existence is dependent on whether we control Astrakhan or not."

rusfor.106.d.rus: "We have managed to seize Astrakhan. It will greatly destabilize Kalmykia, so we can offer them to join us peacefully."

rusfor.107.a: "Bad year for us"

rusfor.108.t: "Stalemate in Astrakhan"
rusfor.108.d: "Fighting in Astrakhan has died down after both sides withdrew from the contested region, citing mounting casualties and dwindling supply but still very little in the way of territorial gains. Recognizing the futility of further offensives, the enemy has asked for a ceasefire, at least for the time being."
rusfor.108.a: "At least we gained experience."

rusfor.109.t: "Leaving for Berlin Conference"
rusfor.109.d: "President Kerensky as representative of Russian Republic in foreign affairs, together with Foreign Minister, has left for Berlin in order to discuss several economic questions and prepare the ground for the future foreign policy discussions."

rusfor.110.a: "Let us negotiate."

rusfor.111.t: "German Companies"
rusfor.111.d: "In order to kickstart our industry, we need money. This year marks the last payment of the Minsk reparations and even though this fact leaves us with much more money in budget next year, it is still not enough. After the Black Monday, the Germans have closed some enterprises in Russia and now we can ask to return them back, though with a greater Russian share."
rusfor.111.a: "Ask for German companies to return to Russia"

rusfor.112.t: "Russia Asks for German Companies in Russia"
rusfor.112.d: "During the Black Monday, many of our companies, including the state-owned ones, have withdrawn their capital from Russia and closed the companies. However, now Russian President has asked to re-open the enterprises, though at a greater Russian share."
rusfor.112.a: "Sure, we need money as well as them"

rusfor.115.d: "The Minsk Treaty should be considered dead by now! Everyone understands this, including Kerensky. The last reparations were paid, but the future of Russo-German Relations shall be discussed with Germans. President Believes that the terms shall be changed and that cooperation with Germany will give us more good than solely repudiating the treaty. We should start the negotiations and try to change the terms."
rusfor.115.a: "Ask Germany for renegotiations."

rusfor.116.t: "Russia Attempts to Re-Negotiate Treaty of Minsk"
rusfor.116.d: "Russian leader has once again arrived in Berlin in order to discuss the Treaty of Minsk. 1936 Reparations were the last ones and now Russia hungrily eyes its own lands - the ones, that never were listed in the treaty. Having Russia as an ally against the Internationale and the Japanese can seem a good idea, but the question is if we ready to give up some of the territories we consider our sphere of influence."

rusfor.118.a: "Treaty of Minsk is considered dead!"

rusfor.119.t: "Central Asian Question"
rusfor.119.d: "We consider that the Central Asian countries should be a part of Russian Sphere of Influence. Despite the fact that the Treaty of Minsk never mentioned these countries, we can try to talk with Germans about them, as they are neighbouring Persia and Afghanistan - regions that might be of German interest."
rusfor.119.a: "Ask the Germans" #-> RUS 120
rusfor.119.b: "We can decide fate of Central Asia without Germany." #-> RUS 117

rusfor.120.t: "Russia Wants to Intervene in Central Asia"
rusfor.120.d: "The fate of Central Asian region was never discussed in the Treaty of Minsk. Therefore, it is up to Russia to decide its fate. However, this can open a Russian border with Persia and Afghanistan, which can fall under Russian influence as well."
rusfor.120.a: "The only thing we restrict is intervention in Persia and Afghanistan!"

rusfor.121.t: "The Matter of Persia and Afghanistan"
rusfor.121.d: "As we thought, the Germans don't think of Central Asia as valuable region. Therefore, it is up to us to decide its fate. However, the Persian and Afghani lands shall not be attacked or invaded by Russian Army."

rusfor.122.t: "Russia Demands Afghani and Persian Subjugation"
rusfor.122.d: "The Russian government has refused our terms, demanding Persia and Afghanistan to be brought into their sphere of influence. If we don't agree with that, it is likely that Russia will tear apart the treaty and act on their own. The only reasonable thing we can offer is joining the Reichspakt. Otherwise, we will become enemies."

rusfor.124.d: "The Germans have left the Conference in anger, making it clear for Russian citizens that the conflict between Berlin and Petrograd is soon to become inevitable, as both sides dig themselves even deeper into their trenches."

rusfor.125.t: "Russians Joins the Reichspakt!"
rusfor.125.d: "To our great surprise, the Russian Government has agreed to join the Reichspakt. This means that an equal power is now present in the alliance and we have nothing to do but to talk to them as equals."

rusfor.126.a: "This marks the end of the Treaty of Minsk!"

rusfor.127.t: "Caucasus Question"
rusfor.127.d: "The region of Caucasus was originally agreed on as a part of Russian Territory. However, in 1924, in the aftermath of the Kolchak Putsch, the whole Don-Kuban region was divided between German and Ottoman spheres of influence. The Don and Kuban Hosts became quasi-states under German protection that ensured the oil shipments to Germany. The Mountain Republic, on the other hand, fell under Ottoman protection, but served the same oil issue. It is hard to imagine that Germany will give up its subjects in the Caucasus, as they won't get the oil and face a serious crisis."
rusfor.127.b: "The whole region should be under Russian control, as was negotiated in Treaty of Minsk!"
rusfor.127.a: "We don't care about Caucasus!"

rusfor.128.t: "Russia Demands the Return of Don-Kuban!"
rusfor.128.d: "The whole region of Caucasus was originally agreed on as a part of Russian Territory. However, in 1924 the whole region was divided between us and the Ottomans. Now, the Russians demand the return of this region to them."

rusfor.128.c: "This region will stay under our control." #-> RUS 131

rusfor.129.t: "Germany Insists on Oil Ownership!"
rusfor.129.d: "Germany has agreed to give up the Caucasus, but they should have the access to the most oil in the region. While this seriously contradicts our chance to own the oil ourselves, we will be able to stay in good terms with Kaiserreich."
rusfor.129.a: "We can't agree with this!" 
rusfor.129.b: "We agree to their terms!" #-> RUS 117

rusfor.130.t: "Germany Wants to Discuss Transcaucasia"
rusfor.130.d: "Germany has agreed to give up the Caucasus, especially the lands we initially owned. However, they still want to have access to Azeri oil through Georgia. Therefore, the Transcaucasian states should stay as they are."

rusfor.132.d: "The most major issue of the Conference is the fate of Eastern European countries, established as German puppet states after the end of Weltkrieg. We'll see what Germans can offer us."
rusfor.132.a: "The Eastern Europe is Russian!"

rusfor.133.t: "Question of Eastern Europe"
rusfor.133.d: "The most major issue of the Conference is the fate of Eastern European countries, established as our satellites after the Weltkrieg. No wonder that they are of primary interest for Russia because of Major slavic population living there. However, we must adapt to current realities and offer Russia some reasonable concessions there."
rusfor.133.a: "Let us see."

rusfor.134.t: "Question of White Ruthenia"
rusfor.134.d: "White Ruthenia is a weak state with weak national identity, where the majority of population is Russian-speaking peasants. We won't loose much by giving it away, but we also should consider that Ukraine will be cut from us."
rusfor.134.a: "Give up White Ruthenia for alliance!"

rusfor.135.d.subj: "Ukraine is the breadbasket of our entire alliance, without its grain and food, we may be at risk of capitulation in the confrontation with the Third International. There are only two solutions that will satisfy both us and the Russians - to give them eastern Ukraine, or leave everything as it is."
rusfor.135.d.ind: "Ukraine has treacherously left our alliance, putting us at risk of extinction. We can't leave it to the Russians without getting any benefit from it. We offer the Russians to join the Reichspakt in exchange for the eastern territories of Ukraine, and no 'buts'!"

rusfor.142.t: "Russia Confronts Japan"
rusfor.142.d: "The Far-Eastern territory of Russia, similar to the Don-Kuban region, seceded to the Japanese-backed state of Transamur. Japan is actively intervening into our affairs in Asia and having Russia an extra threat to the Japanese Empire is just what we need."

Despite the fact that these territories are legally part of Russia, as stipulated by the Minsk Treaty, we are committed to safeguarding the independence of these republics. Failure to uphold these responsibilities would result in a significant escalation of Russian influence in the Caucasus, posing a potential threat not only to the countries of Transcaucasia that have been internationally recognized, but also to [TUR.GetNameDef].\n\nMoreover, Russia will undoubtedly utilize the Minsk Treaty to justify its demands, and engaging in confrontation with them would grant them the freedom to disregard other provisions of the agreement, potentially affecting our immediate allies in Eastern Europe."
rusfor.1000.a: "Threaten Russia!"
rusfor.1000.b: "We must abandon the Caucasus to its fate."

rusfor.1001.t: "Germany Offers Protection"
rusfor.1001.d: "Russian attempts to reassert its sphere of influence on the Caucasus has not gone unnoticed by the German Empire. Diplomatic representatives of German Empire have approached us, seeking to include us into the Reichspakt as a means of protection from Russia. How should we react?"
rusfor.1001.a: "Accept their offer."
rusfor.1001.b: "Refuse."

rusfor.1002.a: "Excellent!"

rusfor.1003.t: "Russia Withdraws From the Caucasus"
rusfor.1003.d: "Today, the Russian ambassador stated that Russia is de-escalating its military presence in the Caucasus and has no intention of exacerbating the situation. However, Russia expressed its utmost dissatisfaction with the German government for its failure to adhere to the Minsk Treaty, which Russia itself had imposed and which clearly delineates Russia's boundaries, and it remains perplexed by the establishment of any "sovereign" entities in the Don, Kuban, and North Caucasus regions."
rusfor.1003.a: "Invite the endangered nations to the Reichspakt!"

rusfor.1004.t: "Germany Withdraws From the Caucasus"
rusfor.1004.d: "In response to Russia's increasing belligerence in the Caucasus, the German Empire chose to completely evacuate all its forces from the region, effectively renouncing any pledges of support or independence for our nation. The German decision not only terminated their \"unviable\" investments but also abandoned us to confront the mounting threat posed by a resurgent Russia."
rusfor.1004.a: "Oh no!"

rusfor.1005.t: "German Empire Threatens Russia!"
rusfor.1005.d: "Today, our ambassador to Germany conveyed a message from the German government indicating that the German Empire supports the independence of the states of the North Caucasus and the Transcaucasus if Russia were to attempt to invade these regions. In essence, they have implied that our legitimate claims to return to internationally recognized boundaries are not a priority for them.\n\nThis egregious violation of international law by Germany cannot be ignored, although some alarmists within the government propose that we focus our military efforts on other areas before directly confronting Berlin."
rusfor.1005.a: "Tear this tattered document — the Minsk Treaty — to shreds!"
rusfor.1005.a2: "Who cares?"
rusfor.1005.b: "Let's focus on other priorities instead!"

rusfor.1006.a: "Cease all contacts between the Reichspakt and Russia!"
rusfor.1006.b: "We will not deviate from our principles."
rusfor.1006.c: "Back down, we can not afford a conflict with Russia."

rusfor.1007.t: "The Reichspakt Ceases All Contacts With Us"
rusfor.1007.d: "In reaction to our refusal to alter the planned 'stabilisation' of the Caucasian region the German Empire has ordered the cessation of all trade and diplomatic contacts between our state and the Reichspakt. Our industrial sector is already feeling the consequences of such drastic actions."
rusfor.1007.a: "We shall survive!"

rusfor.1008.t: "The Caucasus Crisis"
rusfor.1008.d: "Sparked by Russia's increasing hostility in the Caucasus region, the German Empire has taken it upon themselves to stand against their expansionism. This has sparked a crisis between the two states, marked by diplomatic exchanges and mutual boycotts. However, Russia has not backed down, and relations between the two states remain frozen.\n\nRussia was considered to be a second rate power by many across the world, but it has been rebuilding over the years, and this conflict shows that it is not afraid of challenging the German Empire anymore."
rusfor.1008.a: "An enemy of our enemy..."
rusfor.1008.b: "Stand down!"
rusfor.1008.c: "Let us hope peace prevails."


rusfor.1009.t: "What to do with [DKB.GetName]"
rusfor.1009.d: "The Don Republic, also known as the Almighty Don Host, was established on May 18, 1918 under the leadership of Ataman Pyotr Krasnov during the tumultuous period of the Russian Civil War. He helped the White Army fighting the Bolsheviks and strengthened his position in southern Russia by entering into an alliance with the Kuban People's Republic, until, as the end of the war approached, the central white government of Russia ordered the liquidation of the Kuban Republic, which, although cooperating with the Whites, wanted to preserve its independence and even unite with Ukraine. However, the Don managed to maintain a small amount of autonomy as a result of Krasnov's compromise with Kolchak and President Sazonov.\n\nThe course of events took a dramatic turn following the defeat of the Kolchak putsch. General Krasnov, a staunch monarchist who opposed the establishment of a republic, seized the moment to declare a new government. He attempted to march towards Volgograd, only to be met with failure and forced to retreat.\n\nThanks to the German intervention, they achieved full independence and became a buffer state in the Caucasus. Despite the existence of this quasi-state, it cannot be recognized as independent, and our intention is to restore our internationally recognized borders through any means necessary. Our demand is that this region be immediately incorporated into our nation."
rusfor.1009.a: "Demand immediate annexation of Don!"
rusfor.1009.b: "Offer them autonomy as part of Great Russia!"

rusfor.1010.t: "Russia Demands [DKB.GetName]"
rusfor.1010.d.DKB: "Yesterday, the Russian government issued a demand for our full annexation. Should we accede to Russia's claims, we would forfeit our sovereignty entirely, while refusal would result in an imminent Russian incursion. How should we address these dire conditions imposed by the Russian authorities?"
rusfor.1010.d.DKB_overlord: "Yesterday, under the guise of \"restoring Russia's sovereignty within the boundaries established by the Minsk Treaty\", Russia has issued an ultimatum to our government, demanding the immediate transfer of control over several critical areas to Russia. This would effectively result in Russia assuming full control over the [DKB.GetAdjective] region. While their demands may be considered reasonable, we are bound by several binding agreements with the government of [DKB.GetNameDef], which guarantee its independence from Russia. Should we reject these demands, it is possible that Russia will invade."
rusfor.1010.a: "Accept their terms."
rusfor.1010.b: "Never!"

rusfor.1011.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses!"
rusfor.1011.d: "It seems that our peaceful policy towards illegitimate government of [FROM.GetNonIdeologyAdjective] region has failed. Now we have to reconsider more aggressive paths."
rusfor.1011.d.DKB_overlord: "Despite our best efforts the [FROM.GetAdjective] government have refused to withdraw their guarantee of independence of \"[DKB.GetNameDef]\".\n\nThe only solution to this problem for us is war with [FROM.GetNameDef]."
rusfor.1011.a: "Then it is war."
rusfor.1011.b: "We must prepare better first."

rusfor.1012.t: "Liberation of Don"
rusfor.1012.d: "Yesterday, it came to light that the administration of the self-proclaimed [FROM.GetName] has acknowledged the legitimacy of our claims. Today, [DKB.GetLeader] was invited to [217.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], where he met with [ROOT.GetLeader], who accepted his request for Russian liberation of Don region."
rusfor.1012.d.DKB_overlord: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has acceded to our prudent demands for adherence to the terms of the Minsk Treaty. Yesterday, in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], there took place the so-called \"[FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Arbitration\" for the urgent resolution of the Russian–Don crisis, which was conducted by the foreign ministers of [FROM.GetName] and [RUS.GetName]. The delegation from the [DKB.GetName] was led by their Minister of Foreign Affairs. Initially, the delegations of [DKB.GetName] and [RUS.GetName] were invited to articulate their positions. After that, the [FROM.GetAdjective] arbitrator continued negotiations with both delegations over a meal. The arbitral awards were issued around 7pm\n\nThe arbitral decision stated that, in accordance with internationally recognized borders of [RUS.GetNameDef], the government of [DKB.GetName] is obliged to resign voluntarily and sign an instrument on the termination of [DKB.GetNameDef]'s existence as a subject of international law, transferring these powers to the government of Russia. Furthermore, it is required to ensure the peaceful integration into Russia without any resistance. Russia must ensure the security and protection of the population of the [DKB.GetAdjective] region, while [FROM.GetName] must act as a guarantor for a peaceful resolution to the issue. Following this, all [FROM.GetAdjective] troops must vacate the territory of the Don.\n\nThe very next day, our troops liberated the entire territory of Don, and the army of Don was disarmed."
rusfor.1012.a: "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

rusfor.1013.t: "Russia Offers Autonomy"
rusfor.1013.d: "Yesterday, the Russian authorities extended an offer of autonomy and preservation of Cossack priveleges, contingent upon our voluntary reintegration to the Motherland. While these assurances were met with a degree of scepticism, the government appears to be receptive to the concept. After all, we are bound by a shared history and a collective destiny."
rusfor.1013.a: "It's time to put an end to our differences - to serve Russia!"
rusfor.1013.b: "We can never be sure of them."

rusfor.1014.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed!"
rusfor.1014.d: "[FROM.GetAdjective] government was ardent in its support for the concept of voluntary reunion with Russia, considering our shared history, cultural heritage, and, of course, destiny. In turn, we pledged to uphold their rights and privileges."
rusfor.1014.a: "Za Otechestvo!"

rusfor.1015.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Betrayed Us!"
rusfor.1015.d: "As a consequence of the Russian ultimatum, [From.GetNameDef] has left us alone against this threat.\n\nWhat shall we do?"
rusfor.1015.a: "There is nothing we can do..."
rusfor.1015.b: "Resist the invader!"

rusfor.1016.a: "We will crush them!"

rusfor.1020.t: "The Baku Oil Fields"
rusfor.1020.d: "Russia needs oil, and lots of it, if it is going to keep up with the other major powers in industrial and military production. While we have limited oil fields in the central Siberia, our former province of Azerbaijan has a gigantic petroleum industry, which it is finding increasingly difficult to maintain. Should we seek to promote our interests in this region?"
rusfor.1020.a: "Take over the Baku Oil Concern and control their Government!"
rusfor.1020.b: "Guarantee the security of Azerbaijan and invest in the oil fields."
rusfor.1020.c: "Who built Baku's oil plants? Make plans for a hostile takeover!"
rusfor.1020.e: "We shall take back our stolen plants by force, right now!"

rusfor.1021.t: "Russian Investment"
rusfor.1021.d: "The Russian Government has purchased a massive stake in the Baku Oil Concern and are planning on administering, securing and building up large portions of our oil fields themselves. This would mean that we would lose control over much of our government but would at least present us with a powerful patron."
rusfor.1021.a: "Invite the Russians to protect and develop Azerbaijan."
rusfor.1021.b: "Decline the offer, attempt to limit Russian influence!"

rusfor.1022.t: "Azerbaijani Resistance"
rusfor.1022.d: "The foolish Azerbaijani government rejected our attempts to exert our influence over their government. How shall we react to this insolence?"
rusfor.1022.a: "War will solve this!"

rusfor.1023.t: "The Azeris Agree!"
rusfor.1023.d: "Azerbaijan has accepted our purchase of a majority stake in their state oil industry. This gives us a large enough foothold to either totally dominate the economy and government of the country or attempt to begin plans to reincorporate them into Russia."
rusfor.1023.a: "Establish control over the Azeri economy."
rusfor.1023.b: "Start to plan on how best to incorporate Azerbaijan into Russia!"

rusfor.1024.t: "Azerbaijani Autonomy"
rusfor.1024.d: "With Russian domination over Azerbaijan stable some members of our government think that the time has come for the integration of Azerbaijan into the growing Russian empire. It would be quite easy to pass a series of laws which would ensure that the region is more firmly integrated into Russia."
rusfor.1024.a: "It is time for Russia to directly rule over Azerbaijan!"

rusfor.1025.t: "The Georgian Question"
rusfor.1025.d: "Now that the Don-Kuban Union no longer exists we must choose our stance towards the independent state of Georgia. We can either try to bring them into the fold using the direct threat of military power or via covert operations using existing pro-monarchist resistance groups. What shall we do?"
rusfor.1025.a: "Threaten them with force!"

rusfor.10251.d: "Friendly government in Russia has proposed that we join their country. Russians offers us a wide autonomy and we can even win governmental sits in the upcoming elections. We can fully agree, demand more autonomy or secure our independence and join their alliance. However, we can still cut ties with them."

The primary terms are that we would relinquish any and all claims to the territories they rightfully control, including the Transmur-Primorsk region, while this would certainly secure the Russian flank for the forseeable future and potentially give us even greater economic dividends than the Transamurian regime, many of our general staff are ambievalent as to whether it is worth giving up our ambitions over the far east."

rusfor.1110.d: "Mongolia, a product of the Xinhai Revolution, stands as a natural ally for us in the East and serves as a stepping stone for regaining our influence in China and across Asia. Following the defeat of Chinese occupation in 1921, Baron Roman von Ungern-Sternberg assumed the role of de facto dictator and warlord in Mongolia, supported by the Russian army and the ROVS. In 1925, amidst the chaos of the Kolchak coup, the baron seized control over Uriankhai, Ulala and Minusinsk regions, initially presenting it as a response to the putschist threat, but in reality, it was driven by his own ambitions. This development significantly cooled relations with this semi-independent state.\n\nThe government insists on the immediate return of our territories and the establishment of lasting peace in Mongolia through the imposition of a comprehensive agreement. The terms of this accord may range from the securing Mongolia's neutrality to Mongolia's full integration into the Russian military alliance."

rusfor.1112.d.mongolia: "For many Mongols, this day is not a day of joy, as a new agreement has been signed between Russia and the government of [ROOT.GetName] in Khem-Beldyr, which cements a new reality for the region. This treaty obligates us to cede the northern territories to Russia, which many viewed as a yoke in our relationship with Russia. Moreover, under the terms of this agreement, Russia relaxes trade restrictions against us and offers financial assistance to our government.\n\nHowever, the crux of the matter, which many find objectionable and to which our government was compelled to accede, is that it effectively abandons our ambitions. We are compelled by these unfavourable terms to forego any military action to protect the Mongols still under Chinese domination. The agreement mandates us to adopt a neutral stance, and this neutrality appears to be pro-Russian. Alongside our commitment to neutrality, Russia maintains the prerogative to station its military forces and establish military installations within our borders, which serves as a stark reminder of the apprehensions that this agreement is merely the inaugural step in Russia's trajectory towards our subservience."
rusfor.1112.d.russia: "The signing of the latest Russian-Mongolian agreement in Khem-Beldyr represents a significant milestone in our pursuit of regaining our former greatness in Asia. Of particular importance is the fact that the territories of Yenisey and Altay, once seized by the mad Baron, have been returned without bloodshed. Russian newspapers portray this as an undeniable triumph of the government.\n\nHowever, this is just one aspect of the agreement. Its essence lies in ensuring Mongolia's status as a neutral state, renouncing any military action against Russia, and refraining from joining any anti-Russian alliances. Alongside neutrality, there is the provision for unhindered passage of our troops and the establishment of military bases, effectively transforming this sparsely populated and impoverished province into a launching pad for our military operations.\n\nWe hope that in the years to come, we will be able to forge an even closer alliance with the Mongolian government."

rusfor.1113.d.russia: "The signing of the latest Russian-Mongolian treaty in Khem-Beldyr marks a significant step forward in our quest to reclaim our former grandeur in Asia.

rusfor.1224.d: "Finland, while unremarkable and poor, poses a grave threat to our northern flank against Germany. The Karelian Isthmus offers the perfect springboard for a German invasion of Petrograd - one can shell the city without ever leaving Finland. For this reason, it is of utmost importance to neutralise the threat of Finland.\n\nThe first option would be the diplomatic one: demand anti-German neutrality from Finland and promise to respect their sovereignty - a relationship that could later become a proper alliance. The other option is to drop the pretext and demand territorial concessions in the Karelian Isthmus to ensure that the Finns cannot threaten Petrograd even if they wanted to.\n\nWe should start moving forces to the Finnish border to bolster our demands - and if the negotiations go sour, exchange the quill for a sword."

Their great fear is that the Karelian Isthmus will be used as a springboard by the German army against Russia's Baltic jewel.\n\nA draft of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation has been forwarded to the desk of [FIN.GetLeader]. This proposed treaty would ensure a pact of non-aggression between our two nations and allow Russian forces and ships to utilise our bases for the defence of Petrograd. Additionally, we would grant Russia the same economic benefits as those we grant to the states of Mitteleuropa. We would also be forbidden from committing to a military alliance with any power hostile to Russia. While the text talks of neutrality, it is obviously a pro-Russian neutrality.\n\nWhile there has been some military build-up on the border to bolster the demands, it seems surprisingly reasonable of the Russians. It would still obviously limit our sovereignty - and possibly leave us diplomatically isolated, should the Russians decide to demand more. Alternatively, we could always attempt to appeal to the Germans for protection, though it would no doubt increase our dependence on Mitteleuropa."

Their great fear is that the Karelian Isthmus will be used as a springboard by the German army against Russia's Baltic jewel. These territorial demands are merely defensive in nature, the Russian delegation has assured, but we can see them for what they are: naked aggression against our sovereignty.\n\nThe Russians are demanding the Karelian Isthmus and a number of smaller concessions, such as the Outer Isles of the Finnish Gulf and the right to utilise Finnish territory and naval bases to defend Petrograd.\n\nRussian forces are already being mobilised on our borders, ready to bolster their demands with military threats. While we may be outmatched in numbers and industrial production, our military urges us not to surrender an inch of land without a fight, claiming that the loss of the Isthmus would cripple us should Russia decide once more to encroach on our sovereignty. Of course, recognising our weakness before Russia, we could always attempt to appeal to the Germans for protection, though it would no doubt increase our dependence on Mitteleuropa. And of course, there is the option to accept the Russian demands and avoid spilling any blood."

rusfor.1226.d.finland: "The national mood was not entirely cheery as news of the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Russia was signed. The language used in the treaty was rosy, and in it Russia assured their respect for Finnish sovereignty, and intent to defend Finland against any aggression by third-party powers. Finland was declared to be neutral and to maintain friendly relations with all of its neighbours. To achieve this, Russia was granted freedom to utilise Finnish military bases, and a number of smaller islands in the Finnish Gulf were leased to Russia to protect Petrograd. Additionally, the economic appendix included easing restrictions on trade.\n\nWhile the treaty has clarified the Finnish-Russian relationship for now, it does leave much up in the air. A common fear is that it is only the first of many Russian demands, which Finland will now be less able to resist. Still, a much more dangerous bullet - war with Russia - was dodged."
rusfor.1226.d.russia: "Signing the Agreement of Friendship, Cooperation, and Mutual Assistance with Finland was a clear propaganda victory for [RUS.GetLeader]'s government. While the language used in the treaty was purposefully rosy, with our assurances to respect Finnish sovereignty and neutrality, the real achievement was clear: Finland was barred from allying with Germany, and this was enforced by our right to utilise Finnish soil to defend Petrograd against any foreign threats. Additionally, a number of smaller islands in the Finnish Gulf were leased to us, and the economic appendix included easing restrictions on trade. Hopefully, we can persuade the Finns to accept an even closer alliance in the future."

Faced with an overwhelming show of force, the Finnish government has agreed to our demands, and our units are already moving in to occupy the region.\n\nThis bloodless conquest is celebrated as a great victory for [RUS.GetLeader]'s government, the first step on the long road to tearing up Brest-Litovsk, his supporters claim. Regardless, all recognise the triumph as a sign that Russia has returned to the world stage."

rusfor.1228.d: "Russia has issued demands to Finland, wishing to force them to cut ties with us and give the Russians various concessions. While the Russians portray this as merely defensive action to protect Petrograd from potential aggression, it is obvious to us that it's merely a matter of Russian expansionism.\n\nThe Finnish leadership has decided to seek mediation from us, as they already did in 1922 during the East Karelian Uprising. Desperate for a respite from the bloodshed and hoping to find a diplomatic solution, Finland dispatches envoys to Berlin, urging the government to intervene and mediate between Russia and Finland."

The envoys, having traveled to Berlin with hopes of a diplomatic intervention, return with a heavy heart, bearing the weight of Germany's rejection. The Finnish government, faced with the stark reality of standing alone in the brewing conflict, grapples with the consequences of Germany's decision. The rejection of mediation leaves us to face the Russian juggernaut without the prospect of external intervention."

rusfor.1229.b: "Give in."

rusfor.1230.t: "Germans Intervene in Dispute"
rusfor.1230.d: "The Finns have realised that they're no match for us in strength, but rather than accepting our demands, it seems they've gone running to the Germans for protection. Unsurprisingly, the German Empire's foreign minister has claimed that Russia must respect her diplomatic obligations and honour the Treaty of Minsk, but the Germans advocate for a peaceful resolution that could spare both nations from the ravages of war. They suggest that Finland cede us Reboly and Porosozero, as well as border area near Petrograd, though leaving Vyborg in their hands. Finland will receive Petsamo, though, and be guaranteed independence by both our nations\n\nOur government is now presented with a critical decision: accept the German-mediated proposal and engage in diplomatic negotiations, or reject the offer, opting to pursue the military option to resolve the Karelian question. Recollecting the previous Treaty of Tartu, that eventually led to the current war, perhaps, the German mediation is not the best solution for Russian interests? If we decide to reject Germany's offer, public opinion and the economic crisis would prevent them from launching a full-scale intervention."

The joint work of Russian, Finnish and German diplomats managed to negotiate on some concessions, however - we will receive Petsamo, a rich region in the north of Russia and guarantees from both countries, in return - we had to cede Repola, Porajärvi and Raivola. Despite this minor territorial loss, our people are happy that there will be no war."
rusfor.1231.d.germany: "In a move many have seen as inevitable, it seems the Russians have accepted our compromise. Russian forces near the Finnish border have begun to demobilise, and as promised, certain large corporations have been encouraged to sell their assets in Russia to state corporations.\n\nOur influence in the East may have been weakened, but Russia's territorial ambitions have been constrained, and Finland's ties to Mitteleuropa have only been increased. This development is widely seen as a victory for us."

In a recent statement by the empire's foreign minister, the German government claimed that Russia must respect her diplomatic obligations, while rumours circulated that Germany was willing to surrender part of their economic influence over Moscow as compensation. However, Russia has refused to back down. [RUS.GetLeader] has given a statement in which he claimed that these demands are a matter of national security for Russia, and no amount of backroom politics will change that.\n\nDespite the hopes of many in the government, our ambassador to Germany has also quietly informed [FIN.GetLeader] that the mood in Germany is decidedly against a full-scale intervention, meaning that if we refuse the Russian terms again, we'll be on our own. Whether we choose to give in to Russian demands or stand firm, we must take a decisive stance, and quickly."
rusfor.1232.d.germany: "Despite our generous overtures, Russia has refused to back down. [RUS.GetLeader] has given a statement in which he claimed that these demands are a matter of national security for Russia, and no amount of backroom politics will change that.\n\nThe hawks in our government have urged us to prepare a full-scale intervention, resorting to war if necessary, but the disastrous economic and political situation at home, as well as a war-wary public, would make such an action so unpopular as to be unworkable. For now, we have advised the Finns to avoid a full military stand-off with Russia."

rusfor.1240.d: "The state of [WHR.GetName] lies just between us and the Germans. The Slavic population of the country should be brought under our protection before it is too late and we face German forces at the border. There are certain pro-Russian, or at least anti-German movements in the country and we should contact them and try to organize a coup, bringing [WHR.GetName] back to us."

rusfor.1241.d: "Today, definitely with some investment from the Russian government, certain forces in our country have risen against our rule, eventually trying to change the government and join Russia. While we can fear Russian aggression, if the coup fails, at least we will be ready for it."

rusfor.1250.d: "Despite the brave efforts of our troops, our worst fears are beginning to be realised - the Russians have overwhelmed Vyborg, and with control of the city, now possess the capability to push further into our nation, possibly even threatening the capital.\n\nIf we continue to fight on, it is likely the entire nation will be overrun. The vast majority of our generals and politicians urge us to sue for peace before it's too late, though a few hardliner hawks believe the situation may still be turned around."

These terms are what we originally demanded. Having achieved our primary objective, many in our government urge us to accept the deal, claiming that attempting to push further would run the risk of German intervention.

rusfor.1252.d: "After hours of last-minute negotiations between our foreign ministers, Russia has finally accepted our terms of surrender, ending the conflict.\n\nThe scars the war has left on our nation may not heal for quite some time - the region of Vyborg was home to over 400,000 souls now stripped from their homeland, as well as a substantial portion of our industry. We fought as best we could, yet in the end, this is a sad day for Finland."
rusfor.1252.a: "Alas..."

rusfor.1253.t: "Russia Refuses Peace"
rusfor.1253.d: "Despite our numerous attempts at reaching a peace settlement, the Russians have wholly rejected negotiations and now demand our complete submission! This outcome is nothing short of disastrous for our nation. Left with few other options, our only chance of preserving our independence and pressuring the Russians to withdraw would be to call upon the Germans for intervention.\n\nEven in spite of the economic crisis, the prospect of a Russian-dominated Finland would probably be too dangerous for them to ignore, though it would mean surrendering Vyborg to Russia as compensation. And of course, there still remains the option, however reckless, to reject German intervention and fight to the last man."

rusfor.1254.d: "The Russo-Finnish war has reached a turning point. Russian forces have captured Vyborg, achieving their stated objective for the war, but now seem determined to subjugate all of Finland. Left with no other options, the Finnish government has submitted a plea to us through their ambassador, practically begging us to force the Russians to stand down.\n\nFor many in our government, there are few reasons not to intervene. Allowing the Russians to dominate that country would not only be a direct challenge to our sphere of influence, but it would also shake the confidence of our Eastern European allies, all of whom have much to fear from the new Russian regime's aggressive rhetoric. Intervention, however, would come at a cost. We could threaten to pull out of the country, sending them into severe economic troubles, but without offering Vyborg as compensation - in effect agreeing to Russia's original demands - there is no chance of forcing Moscow to back down. Further compensation would also have to be offered through the surrender of a part of our economic influence, weakening our hand should the Russians encroach upon Eastern Europe once more."

rusfor.1254.b: "We don't like them THAT much."

rusfor.1255.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
rusfor.1255.d: "We have been betrayed. The Germans, unwilling to jeopardise their economic interests in Russia or simply too marked by the scars of the Great War to risk fighting another one, have refused all of our requests for intervention.\n\nUpon the breaking of the news, a trickle of high-ranking politicians have already begun to flee abroad, while morale among our armed forces sinks lower and lower. We are on our own."

rusfor.1256.t: "Germans Intervene in Peace Talks"
rusfor.1256.d: "Even with the ongoing volatile international climate, it seems the Germans are still determined to salvage what they can out of their crumbling empire. The German Empire's foreign minister has made a public statement condemning our war with Finland and calling for an immediate resolution to the crisis. We've also heard rumours of German troops preparing to mobilise at a moment's notice, and, perhaps a much more real prospect, German corporations have threatened to pull out of our country if we 'continue to jeopardise stability in Europe', wreaking economic havoc over the nation.\n\nFew believe that the Germans would be willing to act so hastily over Finland, but the possibility has intimidated many in our government into seeking a solution. Communicating through diplomatic backchannels, the Germans have secretly offered to let us walk away with some border territores, along with offering the more immaterial compensation of a sale of Russian assets owned by German companies at a price far below their value, effectively lowering their economic influence over our country in return for peace. Unfortunately, the threat of war, offer of compensation, and still-great German economic influence holding a dagger over our industries mean that we have no choice but to accept."

rusfor.1257.t.finland: "Germans Agree to Intervene"
rusfor.1257.t.germany: "Russians Stand Down"
rusfor.1257.d.finland: "The Germans may be struggling to keep their empire together, but even they can't accept an ally such as ourselves falling to a hostile power. The German Empire's foreign minister has made a public statement condemning Russian aggression on our nation, calling for an immediate resolution to the crisis. Though the threat of direct German intervention was unlikely, the Russians have backed down. In a treaty signed earlier today, we officially ceded Vyborg to [RUS.GetNameDef], but they were forced to drop their claims on the rest of our territory.\n\nA series of Russian asset sales by German companies at prices far below their real value and coerced buy-outs have also brought many to suspect that the Germans have sacrificed a part of their economic influence in Moscow to the Russian government as compensation for the treaty. Whatever the case, our independence has been secured once more."
rusfor.1257.d.germany: "Seemingly unable to risk the smaller threat of war and far closer prospect of economic ruin should we choose to wield our economic influence, the Russians have signed a peace settlement with Finland, gaining Vyborg and promising not to seek any more territory from that country. We may have saved a vital ally, but unfortunately, the compensation offered to Moscow won't be easy to gain back.\n\nThe Russian government has bought back Russian assets from many of our companies, weakening our influence there. Even worse, we've received reports of coerced sales, no doubt as further backlash due to our attempts to halt the country's aggressive expansion. Few believe these costs outweigh the benefits of reaffirming Finland's place in our sphere, though."
rusfor.1257.a: "Thank God for Germany."
rusfor.1257.b: "The Finns had better be grateful."

rusfor.1258.t: "The Finns are Winning"
rusfor.1258.d: "Given the colossal difference in manpower, industry, and size between ourselves and Finland, many believed that the conflict over Vyborg would be a short affair, ending with Russian soldiers parading triumphantly through Helsinki. The reality has turned out to be quite different. Our commanders have proved incompetent, our soldiers undisciplined, and our foe far more tenacious than we expected.\n\nThe Finns have made advances into our territory, capturing key cities and humiliating our soldiers in battle after battle. While there are those among us who refuse to accept defeat, taking such a hardline stance would likely only embarrass us further and bring our regime crumbling down."

Our intelligence networks report that morale among Russian troops has sunk to a new low, while public opinion in that nation has turned decisively against the [RUS_leader].\n\nAs our soldiers have advanced into Russian territory, capturing key cities and proving their military is unable to so much as defend their homeland, the Russians have now offered us peace. Not only has [RUS.GetNameDef] offered to drop their claims on our lands, but we've also been offered control over our claims in Northern Russia. With nothing more to be gained from continuing the war, there is no reason not to accept."
rusfor.1259.d.timeout: "In spite of the world's doubt, the Finnish David has triumphed over the Russian Goliath. [RUS.GetLeader] has led his nation into a war against an enemy which he has clearly underestimated. Undoubtedly believing at first that their forces would easily smash through our defences, the Russian army has time and time again failed to advance into our territory, at most making minor gains before our stiff resistance forces them back.\n\nOur intelligence networks also report that morale among Russian troops has sunk to a new low, while public opinion has turned decisively against the [RUS_leader]. Now admitting defeat, the Russians have offered us peace. We will retain sovereignty over all of our nation, and [RUS.GetNameDef] will drop their claims on Vyborg.

The arrogant Finnish nation would be 'overwhelmed' by the might of the Russian army, or so he claimed. The reality, however, has left everyone dumbfounded at the result.\n\nOur poor performance in the war has already begun to dampen morale. Desertion and defiance among the ranks grow each day, while [RUS.GetLeader] himself has come under increasing scrutiny for leading the nation into a war for which it was not prepared. Should we continue to push on with the war, it will only bring our government closer to collapse - we have no choice but to cut our losses and make peace while we're still the ones in charge."

rusfor.1277.t: "Restoring Control Over the Northern Caucasus"
rusfor.1277.d: "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a: "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."

rusfor.1277.c: "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t: "The Order in the Northern Caucasus is Partially Restored"
rusfor.1278.d1: "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transfered the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has begun to recover very quickly, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.d2: "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.d3: "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations. But in the non-Russian parts of the region only some Christian nations support our army, while in some Muslim villages the local people try to start a guerrilla against Russia. No doubt we will stop it and punish the criminals, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.a: "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t: "Restoration of Order in the Northern Caucasus"
rusfor.1279.d: "More than six months have passed since we had retaken Don-Kuban Union. We could finally restore control over the whole region and set up a new local authorities, which help us to pacify Northern Caucasus. The local Russians and other Christian nations have strengthened their positions and are finally free from raids and attacks of the hostile tribes, rebellious nations accepted our rule and the criminals who fought against us either died or immigrated. The new era of the prosperity in the Russian South finally starts!"

rusfor.1280.d: "The Kuban People's Republic, declared in 1918, became embroiled in a tumultuous political landscape in southern Russia. The shifting power dynamics and indecisiveness of Hetman's Ukraine left Kuban vulnerable to its enemies, ultimately resulting in its annexation by the Armed Forces of Southern Russia.\n\nIn response, a rebellion led by Ryabokon erupted in Kuban, lasting until 1925, when internal instability in Russia culminated in the secession of Kuban region from Russian control. Power shifted to the Kuban Insurgent Army, reinstating the People's Republic and Rada. Vasil Ivanis, a prominent figure in the pro-Ukrainian Chernomortsy (Black Sea) movement, was elected as the new Ataman of the Republic. Under his leadership, Kuban experienced robust economic growth, fostered a strong cooperative spirit, and embraced democratic traditions, positioning itself as one of the most prosperous fragments of the erstwhile Russian Empire.\n\nBut it is high time to bring an end to this \"samostiynost'\". Kuban is undeniably a part of the larger whole that is Russia, and it is now time to assert the full subjugation of this region."

This would effectively result in Russia assuming full control over the [KUB.GetAdjective] region. While their demands may be considered reasonable, we are bound by several binding agreements with the government of [KUB.GetNameDef], which guarantee its independence from Russia.

rusfor.1283.d.KUB_overlord: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has acceded to our prudent demands for adherence to the terms of the Minsk Treaty. Yesterday, in [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], there took place the so-called \"[FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] Arbitration\" for the urgent resolution of the Russian–Kuban crisis, which was conducted by the foreign ministers of [FROM.GetName] and [RUS.GetName]. The delegation from the [KUB.GetName] was led by their Minister of Foreign Affairs. Initially, the delegations of [KUB.GetName] and [RUS.GetName] were invited to articulate their positions. After that, the [FROM.GetAdjective] arbitrator continued negotiations with both delegations over a meal. The arbitral awards were issued around 7pm\n\nThe arbitral decision stated that, in accordance with internationally recognized borders of [RUS.GetNameDef], the government of [KUB.GetName] is obliged to resign voluntarily and sign an instrument on the termination of [KUB.GetNameDef]'s existence as a subject of international law, transferring these powers to the government of Russia. Furthermore, it is required to ensure the peaceful integration into Russia without any resistance. Russia must ensure the security and protection of the population of the [KUB.GetAdjective] region, while [FROM.GetName] must act as a guarantor for a peaceful resolution to the issue. Following this, all [FROM.GetAdjective] troops must vacate the territory of the Kuban.\n\nThe very next day, our troops liberated the entire territory of Kuban, and the army of Kuban was disarmed."
rusfor.1283.a: "Another victory for Russian diplomacy!"

rusfor.1285.t: "What to do with [KLY.GetName]"
rusfor.1285.d: "The Kalmyk national movement emerged in the immediate aftermath of the February Revolution, comprising two distinct factions. One faction advocated for the establishment of Zemstvos and democratic reforms, while the other sought to integrate the Kalmyks into the Cossack community and supported constitutional monarchist Russia.\n\nFollowing the Bolshevik seizure of power, Danzan Tundutov, who had been elected as the ataman of the Astrakhan Cossack Host, declared the formation of a \"Kalmyk Military Government\" and promulgated a \"Cossack Constitution\". This marked the triumph of the Cossack-Kalmyk faction. However, the Astrakhan rebellion was ultimately suppressed, and Tundutov did not return to Kalmykia until 1918. He then formed an army with support from Hetman Skoropadsky and Ataman Krasnov, aiming to regain control.\n\nIn the year 1919, in the course of the struggle against the secessionist movements, General Kornilov deprived Tundutov of his position as leader of the Astrakhan Cossacks. Tundutov was compelled to seek refuge abroad, residing in the Azerbaijan People's Republic and subsequently in Germany. However, he returned to Astrakhan in the year 1925. There, in collaboration with Krasnov, they orchestrated a coup d'état in support of Kolchak, re-establishing the Astrakhan-Kalmyk Cossack Host. Subsequently, Tundutov assumed control over the occupied Astrakhan region as an autonomous entity, eventually declaring \"independence\".\n\nAt present, this quasi-state of Kalmykia serves as a hindrance to the restoration of Russia's territorial integrity. It is high time to bring an end to this Buddhists' disobedience and incorporate the steppes back into our fold."
rusfor.1285.a: "Demand immediate annexation of Kalmyks!"
rusfor.1285.b: "Offer them autonomy as part of Great Russia!"

rusfor.1286.t: "Russia Demands [KLY.GetName]"
rusfor.1286.d.KLY: "Yesterday, the Russian government issued a demand for our full annexation. Should we accede to Russia's claims, we would forfeit our sovereignty entirely, while refusal would result in an imminent Russian incursion. How should we address these dire conditions imposed by the Russian authorities?"
rusfor.1286.d.KLY_overlord: "Yesterday, under the guise of \"restoring Russia's sovereignty within the boundaries established by the Minsk Treaty\", Russia has issued an ultimatum to our government, demanding the immediate transfer of control over several critical areas to Russia. This would effectively result in Russia assuming full control over the [KLY.GetAdjective] region. While their demands may be considered reasonable, we are bound by several binding agreements with the government of [KLY.GetNameDef], which guarantee its independence from Russia. Should we reject these demands, it is possible that Russia will invade."

rusfor.1288.t: "Liberation of the Kalmyk Steppe"
rusfor.1288.d: "Yesterday, it came to light that the administration of the self-proclaimed [FROM.GetName] has acknowledged the legitimacy of our claims.

rusfor.1295.a: "They can have Northern Caucasus."

rusfor.1302.b: "Back down."

rusfor.1303.t: "The Ottomans Gave Up"
rusfor.1303.d: "It looks like the Ottoman Empire has given up. They understand that fighting over the land that they are not even connected to by land or sea is worthless."

We have several choices, however. The first one is to sign a non-aggression treaty with Japan and improve our trade, it will likely satisfy the Japanese Government, but we don't really profit from it. The second one is to ask for Sakhalin in exchange for treaty and trade. The third one is to ask for the Kuril islands along with Sakhalin. However, the Japanese government is unlikely to agree to such terms. But, we can only check it if we send a proposition."

rusd.9.b: "Reach an agreement, but keep the reforms to a minimum."
rusd.9.c: "Reach a thorough agreement."

rusd.10.t: "Harsh Measures"
rusd.10.d: "The commander of a local army garrison has proposed that we use brute force in order to disperse the strikers and force them to go back to work."
rusd.10.a: "Why not? It's quicker than those negotiations!"
rusd.10.b: "No, we must not be too harsh."

rusd.11.t: "The Strikers Give Up!"
rusd.11.d: "The slow war of attrition between us and the strikers has been won by the government. The workers, seeing little success in their efforts, are about to call off the strike."
rusd.11.a: "Splendid!"

rusd.12.t: "The Workers Return to the Factories"
rusd.12.d: "With the crisis resolved, the factories may return to their previous efficiency."
rusd.12.a: "Excellent!"

rusd.13.t: "General Strike"
rusd.13.d: "Workers organisations all over the Russia have reached an agreement and decided to call for a general strike. Even though the response to their initiative has been rather limited so far, it is very possible that more and more workers will join the strike, should the situation continue to deteriorate."
rusd.13.a: "Damned Socialists!"

rusd.14.t: "General Strike Expands"

rusd.19.t: "Blackhundreds Overthrow the Government"
rusd.19.d: "The rigging was suspected and the RNSMA has overthrown the government with the help of pro-monarchist officers. The arrests of socialists have already started and it seems that the situation is bad for the republican forces. Now they have the only way to escape or to accept the new regime."

rusd.21.t: "Revolution!"
rusd.21.d: "The workers demand a return to the proletarian government, the peasants take away the land from the state, and the Internationale sounds again on the streets of the capital! Soviets have been formed all over the country, with the Supreme Soviet standing above them all and claiming political power equal to our government.\n\nDue to the fact that earlier the government got rid of the army mutiny and the influence of conservative generals, the new workers' and peasants' Soviet government practically met no resistance, and soon red flags were flying all over the country."
rusd.21.a: "The Constitution forbids such a thing!"

RUS_Future_Of_The_Republic_civil_war: "Our country will plunge into civil war!"

rusd.22.t: "Senate Seizes Power"
rusd.22.d: "It's been almost 6 months since the political crisis in Russia has started. Today several high senators proclaimed the Senate's sovereignity in Russian Republic. Moreover, they argue, according to the constitution, as Dmitri Pavlovich Romanov is current acting president of Russia, it is his supreme duty to restore the control in the country. The Senate, due to the Duma's unability to form a coalition and elect the government, proclaims Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov an incumbent President of the Russian Republic."
rusd.22.a: "Another Romanov?"
rusd.23.d: "PSR was unable to secure its weak power across Russia. Today several high military commanders, under the leadership of Lavr Kornilov, with the help of Russian Army have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities. NSP members have been arrested and are going to be judged for treason against the Motherland."

rusd.24.t: "Military Coup d'etat"
rusd.24.d: "The government was unable to secure its weak power across Russia. Today several high military commanders, under the leadership of Lavr Kornilov, with the help of Russian Army have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities."
rusd.24.a: "Kornilov shall save Holy Russia!"

rusd.25.t: "Rumors of a Plot"
rusd.25.d: "There are rumors that some high military generals are planning a coup against our government. We have a choice to purge them, however our army is in weak position and purging talented generals can only make the things complicated."
rusd.25.a: "Purge them."
rusd.25.b: "We'll try to bring them over"

rusd.26.t: "Riot in Petrograd!"
rusd.26.d: "Today there is an armed riot in Petrograd. At first, workers have organized a strike, but it quickly exploded in a mass unrest. The most worrying is however that some of the officers refused to disperse a crowd and joined them. The situation is getting out of control and we should make an important decision."
rusd.26.a: "Liquidate the unrest at any cost."
rusd.26.b: "Try to negotiate with their leaders."

rusd.27.t: "The Riot Expands!"
rusd.27.d: "We were unable to negotiate with their leaders and now the riot has expanded to the neighbouring regions. The similar situation is in Moscow and other large industrial cities. We should do something now, or else the rebels can seize the control of the government."
rusd.27.a: "Shoot them."

rusd.28.t: "Victory of Revolutionaries!" 
rusd.28.d: "Military Junta was unable to secure its weak power across Russia. Today several high military commanders, led by Zhukov, have seized administrative buildings in large Russian cities. Kornilov's government has been arrested, while some White generals escaped to Transamur. However, the Siberia is still uncontrolled by us, and Kolchak is likely to capture these territories."

russia.1901.d: "A heavily encrypted telegram has just been delivered by a diplomat from [RUS.GetNameDef] today, bearing grave tidings. Due to heavy pressure and occupation by enemy forces, the Russian Army is unlikely to be able to mount a coordinated defence. As such, [RUS.GetLeader] has opted to go into exile, and mount a defence from their allies' territories. However, with the leader of the alliance in such a dire predicament, it is unlikely that us, and other members of the [RUS.GetFactionName] will pursue a prolonged conflict with the enemies of [RUS.GetNameDef], and will instead seek for peace, out of self-preservation. With this, the collapse of the [RUS.GetFactionName] will be inevitable."

russia.1902.t: "The Fall of Russia"
russia.1902.d: "Not long ago, [RUS.GetNameDef] was at the zenith of their power - fueled by revanchist sentiment, the Moscow Accord posed one of the most credible threats to the German world order. Some went as far as to say that, in a few years, Russia was poised to take Germany's place as world hegemon. \n\nHowever, its current war effort has proven to be disastrous. With several major cities fallen, the situation has reached the point where the Russian government can no longer offer serious resistance to its enemies, and has begun to seek peace terms - and with its defeat, the international alliance that it led has broken down. Its surviving members must now fend for themselves in an uncertain future."

rusd.31.t: "Fund Rebels in Karelia?"
rusd.31.d: "[RUS.GetName] is now in a weak position. A chaotic revolution led to insurgency in Siberia and strengthening of Transamur. We can take an advantage of the situation and capture Eastern Karelia - the land that is ought to be ours!"

rusd.33.b: "We cannot intervene now."

rusd.34.t: "Install Puppet Government in Karelia?"
rusd.34.d: "The Eastern Karelia independence is not only caused by weakness of Russian government, but also by fellow Karelians who wished to be a part of Finland. We must install close ties between our countries and prepare for their integration."

### Kerensky Events ###

rusd.40.t: "End the State of Emergency"
rusd.40.d: "The political crisis is gone and it seems that all radical factions have been eliminated. Now it's time for snap presidential elections."
rusd.40.a: "Kerensky retires, KSR is dissolved."
rusd.40.b: "Kerensky stays."

rusd.50.t: "Kornilov Consolidates His Rule"
rusd.50.d: "It has been a while since Lavr Kornilov and his loyal military generals have seized power in Russia. Now it's time to reform the country and establish a new provisional government to satisfy our needs."
rusd.50.a: "Russia has only two friends: army and fleet"

rusd.51.t: "Choosing the Prime Minister"
rusd.51.d: "The prime minister is one of the most important officials in the Russian Republic, who can define Russian internal policy. Currently, we have 4 candidates to choose. The first one is to leave Felix Yusupov, best friend of Dmitriy Pavlovich and current prime minister. The second one is to choose Vasily Shulgin, leader of the VNS party, and a leading figure of the Whites. The third one is to choose popular amongst conservatives Anton Denikin, a bit too authoritarian, but experienced general. The last choice is to elect the leader of the Natsional-Demokraty Faction, Nikolay Trubetzkoy, the least famous, but a prominent politician."
rusd.51.a: "Yusupov, President's Closest Friend."
rusd.51.b: "Vasily Shulgin, a Russian nationalist and monarchist."
rusd.51.c: "Marshall Denikin, Authoritarian Militarist."
rusd.51.e: "Mr. Trubetzkoy, National-Democrat."

rusd.53.t: "Forming the Cabinet of Ministers"
rusd.53.d: "Kornilov has consolidated his junta, but to increase efficiency of his rule, he now should decide on a ministers' cabinet. Boris Savinkov, a former terrorist and socialist turned populist and nationalist and protector of the Russian peasants in the Duma, a talented writer, as well as the leader of the Combat Squads in the different Russian cities and towns, Savinkov is ready to accept the role of a Kornilov supporter and to start rebuilding the Russian society on the basis of his ideology of National Renewal. Another variant is Pyotr Wrangel, Kornilov's ROVS assistant. A third possibility is to turn to the ever popular 'Peasant Marshall' Anton Denikin. However, Kornilov is a popular and charismatic leader. The last option is to leave him as the head of government and prepare for taking on the mantle of the Supreme Ruler of Russia."
rusd.53.a: "Invite the Vozhd of the peasants into the government!"
rusd.53.b: "The Black Baron will lead the government"
rusd.53.e: "The Peasant Marshall will lead the government"
rusd.53.c: "Kornilov shall stay as head of government"

rusd.54.t: "Kornilov's Death"
rusd.54.d.savinkov: "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Now nothing can stop Savinkov from merging posts of the president and the prime-minister and thus becoming unassailable in his leadership over Russia. The second variant is a military clique led by Denikin that will succeed Kornilov's junta in its core meaning."
rusd.54.d.denikin: "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Two cliques are poised to seize control after Kornilov's passing. The first is led by the young officers of Baron Pyotr Wrangel. By no means a liberal, the Baron, however, knows that Russia must modernise and the societal issues of the state be resolved by a certain amount of governmental pragmatism. In opposition stands field marshal Anton Denikin, who favours continued authoritarian military rule solidified by strong traditionalism."
rusd.54.a: "Boris Savinkov merges the posts of president and prime-minister."
rusd.54.b: "Field marshal Denikin rallies the conservative officers!"
rusd.54.e: "Baron Wrangel succeeds him."
rusd.55.a: "Boris Savinkov and his combat squads capture power"
rusd.56.d: "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief, one of the four officers that led the White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the civil war, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68.  Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."
rusd.56.a: "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more." 

rusd.57.t: "Kornilov is Proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia"
rusd.57.d: "Lavr Kornilov, faithful servant of Russia through the Russo-Japanese War and all the way to the Russian Civil War, has solidified his rule to such a degree that there remains no other reasonable option for leadership of the Russian people other than himself. His militarized governorship seems set to continue indefinitely, with all who would oppose such a measure having long since entered silence or been put into a grave.\n\nThe decision for Kornilov to finally become the Supreme Ruler of Russia, until his death or a well-deserved retirement, was announced before a crowd of both civilians and soldiers in Moscow, with Kornilov himself declaring that the era of Russian governance that lacked power and confidence would be firmly set in the past, that the rot of the Kerensky regime had now been finally washed away and the stains of corruption on the Motherland would now be just a bitter memory. Immediately, his fiery words brought cheers and jubilation from those in attendance to his speech, which the once-humble man from Turkestan was more than pleased to witness. The uproar intensified upon his promise of greater victories for the Russian pople now being in the near future, not the least of which being his assurance that under his benevolent, if strict, leadership, that Russia would establish itself as a power that would make the world tremble.\n\nThrough an unflinching committment to the mission of saving Russia, Kornilov has now become the most powerful man within it, and now all that remains is seizing the future."
rusd.57.a: "Glory to Kornilov! Glory to Russia!"

rusd.66.t: "Fate of Russia"
rusd.66.d.denikin: "Denikin has consolidated his power, but now it is time to decide the future of Russian politics. The first choice is to restore democracy under a constitutional monarchy. However, this would take place under an authoritarian conservative rule, rather than the liberal democratic system that some have clamored for for years. The second one is to declare Denikin the Supreme Ruler of Russia and stay as a military dictatorship." 
rusd.66.d.wrangel: "Wrangel has consolidated his power, but now it is time to decide the future of Russian politics. The first choice would be to give Kirill I his rightful place as Russian Tsar, which would restore the old absolute monarchy. Another, perhaps more controversial option would be to proclaim Wrangel the Tsar of Russia, while also maintaining military rule." 
rusd.66.a: "Restore Constitutional Monarchy"
rusd.66.b: "Proclaim Denikin the Supreme Ruler"
rusd.66.c: "Restore Absolute Monarchy"
rusd.66.e: "Proclaim Wrangel the Tsar"

rusd.67.t: "Provisional Government"
rusd.67.d: "Denikin has decided to restore constitutional monarchy in Russia, but under authoritarian and conservative rule to secure Russian from socialists and syndicalists. Snap Elections will be held in 2 months, but for now a provisional government shall be chosen."
rusd.67.a: "Trubetzkoy, leader of Yevraziytsy"
rusd.67.b: "Shulgin, leader of VNS"
rusd.67.c: "A provisional military government shall rule before the elections"

rusd.68.d: "Wrangel has decided to restore absolute monarchy in Russia. The republican system proved to be unstable and unpopular amongst Russian people and Tsar is the only person who can save Russia."

rusd.69.t: "Denikin Is Proclaimed Supreme Ruler of Russia!"
rusd.69.d: "Denikin has decided to maintain his leadership as a military dictator and today he was officially proclaimed the Supreme Ruler of Russia."
rusd.69.a: "Denikin is the new vozhd."

### Unsorted ###

rusd.35.t: "Status of the Orthodox Church"
rusd.35.d: "Article 5 of the Constitution stipulates that «Russia is a secular state in which no religion can enjoy privileges or rights that are exclusive to it, and no religious body has the right to participate in governmental decision-making». For a country which, up to that point, was built upon the Russian Orthodox Church, this was a rather shocking change in policy which many people could not agree with. In 1927, Sergius ascended to the patriarchal throne, and since then, he has vigorously advocated for changes to Article 5 and the granting of a prominent status to the Church in the Russian state. Now, with Kerensky's departure and a new administration in place, he has formally petitioned the government to revise the Constitution, granting the Orthodox Christianity the status of an official state religion.\n\nOur «pious» deputies have swiftly seized upon this opportunity, and both liberals and progressives — including many Muscovite Old Believers, like Ryabushinsky family — are actively lobbying for these amendments."
rusd.35.a: "Repeal Article 5."
rusd.35.b: "Russia shall stay secular!"

rusd.36.t: "The Liberals Criticise the Clergy"
rusd.36.d: "It seems that the liberal elements of our society consider it rather unwise to maintain such strong bonds between the Church and the state. During a small demonstration in the capital, they have demanded more religious pluralism and secularisation of the government."
rusd.36.a: "Let them shout!"

rusd.37.t: "The Clergy Criticises Our Government"
rusd.37.d: "A number of priests have voiced their disagreement with our policy of a secular and modern state. Even though this fact has little importance, we must keep in mind that religion plays a huge role in common people's lives."
rusd.37.a: "Progress cannot be stopped!"

rusd.38.t: "The Patriarch Criticises Our Government"
rusd.38.d: "Seeing increased displeasure among the common people, the patriarch has decided to voice his concern about the increasing secularisation of our state. Even if we try to turn a deaf ear on the clergy's demands, we cannot easily ignore a character so influential and powerful such as the patriarch."
rusd.38.a: "Everything shall stay as it is!"
rusd.38.b: "Encourage a national debate on religious matters."
rusd.38.c: "He is right, we must change the system."

rusd.39.t: "Constitutional Court Examines the Legislation"
rusd.39.d: "Today, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation has deliberated on an appeal submitted by a group of liberal-minded individuals and left-leaning politicians, representing their interests. In light of the ongoing parliamentary discussion on a bill aimed at establishing state religion in Russia, the ultimate decision rests with the Constitutional Court, as Article 5 of the Constitution explicitly states that Russia is a secular state. This fundamental principle cannot be altered in any manner.\n\nAmong others articles of the first chapter of the Constitution, Article 5 serves as the bedrock of our constitutional framework, and repealing it will underscore the essence of our nation's foundation, as acknowledged by the initiative group. The Constitutional Court is likely to align with the group's stance, but left-leaning politicians express concern that if the legislation proposal includes amendments guaranteeing respect for other faiths and promoting religious tolerance, the Court may be swayed by promises from the right."
rusd.39.a: "The left are right - we should not change it"
rusd.39.b: "The Сourt requested revisions, which the conservatives acceded to."

rusd.47.t: "Article 5 Remains in Force!"
rusd.47.d: "The ruling of the Constitutional Court regarding the contentious draft legislation, which proposed amending Article 5 to declare Orthodoxy as the state religion of Russia, was unequivocal and resolute — no one possesses the authority to alter the fundamental provisions of the Constitution, particularly those enshrined in the initial chapter of our fundamental laws.\n\nThis decision met with a resounding failure in Parliament, and the bill swiftly withdrew. While the Right is in turmoil, the Left is celebrating their minor triumph."
rusd.47.a: "Interesting."

rusd.48.t: "Cossack Privileges and Their Hosts"
rusd.48.d.intro: "The Russian Cossacks, descendants of military settlers hailing from the steppes, roamed the southern and eastern frontiers of Russia, embodying a unique cultural identity that is undeniably Russian. Despite their valiant efforts during the Civil War, their quest for official autonomy was thwarted by the Constitution, and their fortunes took a sharp turn for the worse under the policies of the early SR-Kadet government from 1920 to 1924. This led them to consider a coup in 1925. Despite their absence of ethnic majority status outside their own villages, the Cossacks often owned the majority of land in their territories. Their political power and educational opportunities placed them in a privileged position compared to ordinary tenant farmers and urban dwellers, constituting a significant obstacle in their interactions with the SRs and other socialists. By the beginning of 1936, there were no Cossack Hosts left within the actual, not official boundaries of our state, and the country had lost a vital tool for quelling internal unrest."
rusd.48.d.srs: "$rusd.48.d.intro$\n\nIn practice, the Cossacks are our enemy. They are substantial landowners who possess unwarranted advantages compared to the common Russian peasants residing on their estates. Indeed, we appreciate the Cossacks' martial prowess, yet is it not the responsibility of every patriotic Russian to uphold this virtue? A person should not be rewarded merely for fulfilling what is expected of them, and thus, many within the party advocate for the eradication of the Cossack presence in New Russia, with their lands being naturally redistributed in favour of the loyal peasantry of Russia, who are as capable and patriotic as their Cossack counterparts."
rusd.48.d.rovs: "$rusd.48.d.intro$\n\nMany of the most prominent and brilliant Russian military commanders either have Cossack ancestry or have led Cossack units. There is no doubt that the legacy of the Cossacks embodies the enduring chivalry and valor of the Russian warrior. While there are certainly social considerations to be taken into account in the implementation of Cossack formations, it is ultimately imperative that the government uphold this tradition."
rusd.48.d.dem: "$rusd.48.d.intro$\n\nTo many, the image of the Cossacks is associated with a vestige of the bygone era of the aristocratic and militaristic Imperial Russia under Nicholas I. Others perceive Cossack identity as an integral part of Russian culture, a distinctive regional identity that should be nurtured and cherished. Regardless of any political or social considerations, it is important to acknowledge that the Cossacks constitute a valuable asset in maintaining internal stability, serving as a ready-to-mobilize force against potential domestic unrest. This role may prove advantageous for any regime, irrespective of one's ideological beliefs."
rusd.48.a: "They must be the forefront of our army!"
rusd.48.b: "We shouldn't change the situation."

rusd.49.t: "Unrest Among the Military"
rusd.49.d: "The election of Shlyapnikov to the position of interim president seems to have caused negative repercussions. Much of the top military leadership have vocally spoke out against his premiership and it is alleged that privately, those generals both vocal and quiet of the situation have signalled that they would not intervene were the president to be deposed. Among the lower levels of the military there has been great unrest with reactionary agitation whipping the soldiers into an unruly frenzy."
rusd.49.a: "Worrying."

rusd.125.t: "Bastion of Democracy"
rusd.125.d: "Maintenance of the democratic regime combined with the stable development of the state led to the emigration of some celebrities from syndicalist countries to Russia. This led, for example, to the arrival in Russia of the good friend of Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov, Coco Chanel. That mademoiselle Chanel has chosen to open her office in a village near Tula shows that Russia is a Bastion of Democracy, where everyone can run his or her business without difficulties from the government."
rusd.125.a: "Glamour in his democracy!"

rusd.126.t: "Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech"
rusd.126.d: "Germany's defeat at the hands of combined French and Russian arms some time ago has sent shockwaves across the world, and it has become apparent that this 'Second Weltkrieg' has changed the face of Europe for years to come. The continent has been divided between the Third Internationale and the Russian bloc, both of which wield enormous forces and have a bone to pick with the other side. And yet, neither of them have chosen to strike first, leaving the continent split in twain.\n\nThe Petrograd University in Russia has had the honour of hosting Sir Winston Churchill, a noted British statesman, writer, and former First Lord of the Admiralty of Britain. Speaking to the attending students, Churchill first made sure to note the great sacrifices which the Russian nation has made during the Second Weltkrieg, and assured that the British Empire and Russia shall always be natural allies in this new world order. The politician described Europe as a continent divided between two fundamentally different forces - one of liberty and one of Syndicalist terror, one of good and one of evil, and that an Iron Curtain divides them. He expresses his dismay that so much of Europe's heritage and famous cities now lie in the "French sphere", and hope that Russia and the Commonwealth can unite against this revolutionary threat.\n\nThough Churchill was not the first to express this idea, the striking imagery of his speech have set a new checkpoint in history. Europe, and with it, the world have been divided in a frozen conflict, one of ideological strife rather than power balance. It may only be solved via subversion, arms race and diplomacy...or a conflict far more destructive than the Second Weltkrieg."
rusd.126.a: "A new age in world history..."

rusd.220.t: "Our Industrial Development Improved!"
rusd.220.d: "Due to our efforts in industrializing our country, our current minister of economy has reported to the government, that the pace of industrial growth allows us to talk about bringing our economy to a new level. Despite the fact that we cannot yet fully reckon with Western countries in terms of the level of development of our economy, in the near future we will definitely approach the moment when we can call our country industrially developed."
rusd.220.a: "That's really great."

### Gorgulov Events ###

russia.442.t: "The Formation of Great Skythia?"
russia.442.d: "Pavel Gorgulov - the Green Vozhd and the reborn Son of the Skythians - has led our peasant armies and the Green Legion to victory after triumphant victory, conquering all the lands of Old Skythia and beyond under the unstoppable tide of our forces. Always a true believer in the storied tradition of the Old Skythians, it is no secret that Gorgulov has modeled much of the new Russian culture on exaggerated accounts of Skythian history, but now he could take it one step further. With the old nomadic lands of the Geloni, the Saka, the Budini, the Androphagi, and all the other Skythian tribes from antiquity all being consolidated into our national fabric by Gorgulov’s hand, there is no one in the way to stop him should he decide to take this fascination even further. \n\nSure, we could go on living in our new Russian Peasant's State, continuing to live our simple Russian lives according to our long, tedious, yet stoic Russian history and culture, but why settle for being mere Russians when we could be Skythian! If we were to indulge Gorgulov’s ‘appreciation’ for Skythian culture, we could finally push the mildly unhinged Green Vozhd to lose all inhibition and fully begin to reform our nation into the reincarnation of the Great Skythia of antiquity! As if we lept from the pages of history and Herodotus’ writings, Skythia can be reborn if we so will it. The noble nomadic warrior culture of these long-lost demigods does not have to be lost, for we can bring it back to life here in our newly consolidated nation. What course shall the Green Vozhd Gorgulov take us on at this all-important crossroads?"
russia.442.a: "Like Koloksai and Palacus before him, Gorgulov too shall rise to rule Skythia!"
russia.442.b: "Skythia is dead, and our Russia is their new successor. We keep our culture and our name!"

russia.450.d: "Our Vozhd, Viktor Abakumov, is no stranger to security and law enforcement, being part of Boris Savinkov's private circle and having insured against his many detractors, be they socialists, tsarists or others. Despite his experience, one thing that even Abakumov did not see coming was the betrayal of Gorgulov and his green armies, who mercilessly murdered our former leader and tried to take over Russia to impose their demented primitivist vision.\n\nHowever, Abakumov has learned from his mistakes, and now that he is Vozhd, he will not tolerate treason in our ranks! That's why, after long investigations, Abakumov has ordered large-scale purges of the party in order to ensure the loyalty of its cadres suspected of showing sympathy towards Gorgulov's cause, towards the old Tsar or even towards socialism, and to provide stability as our country emerges from recession and starts to regain its place in the world!\n\nSome will call him a ruthless tyrant, but the real Russians know that Abakumov is undertaking these purges for the good of the nation and the people!"
russia.450.a: "The enemies of the people have nowhere to hide!"

### Senate Events ###

rusd.143.t: "Never Another 1905, Never Another 1917"
rusd.143.d: "When Tsar Nicholas II caved to the rabble-rousers in 1905 and gave the commoners a voice via the State Duma, his benevolence was rewarded with spiteful demands for even more until we finally found ourselves in the midst of civil war. While the White Movement, led by the finest military minds in Russia, managed to eventually restore order, it came at a perilous cost. Millions of Russian lives had been extinguished by the scourges of Bolshevism, liberal republicanism, and every other ill that the enemies of Russia sought to tear her apart with.\n\nWith these lessons learned through the furnaces of war and the grievous sacrifice of our people, the Tsar knows that he cannot repeat the mistakes that his predecessors made when giving the people an inch only for them to take a mile. From here on, the Imperial ruler of Russia will reign with a firm hand, free to move the nation and her people forward without the constraints of lesser men and their petty concerns that merely exist in the here and now, devoid of the Tsar's prospicience and divinely ordained rule.\n\nThe mistake of democracy will not be repeated, and Russia's people will be happier for it with the stability and prosperity that their Tsar will bring them."
rusd.143.a: "Long Live Russia! One and Indivisible!"

rusd.144.t: "Union of Nikolay II"
rusd.144.d: "'Union of the perpetuation of the legacy of the Nikolay II' or just 'Union of Nikolay II' is an organisation, founded by the former tsarist officials such as Pyotr Bark and Vladimir Kokovtsov, who want to keep the remembrance of the last Russian tsar and his policy. They have proposed a program of the events to show the role of Nikolay II for the Russian people all over the country. The Senate pointed out that we should support this union to establish close connections with the former, but powerful officials. It should allow us to gain some votes of the conservative members of the local and state Dumas."
rusd.144.a: "We will remember Nikolay for all his good deeds for Russia."
rusd.144.b: "Many people are still republicans - we won't support the Union."

rusd.145.t: "Day of Triumph"
rusd.145.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the [ROOT.GetLeader], who is the Head of the Senate could finally stop the lasting crisis, which weakened Russia. The President, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give [ROOT.GetLeader] the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nikolay II and president Kerensky didn't have. Nothing can stop the President from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"
rusd.145.a: "Long live the Aristocrats!"

rusd.146.t: "Endless Deadlock"
rusd.146.d: "The Senate, which represents the richest Russian industrialists, the old aristocracy and the Russian Church together with the Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich Romanov on the top of the Senate unfortunately couldn't stop the lasting crisis, which weakens Russia. The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago. It seems that Dmitriy Romanov has to fight for the support also against some of the senators."
rusd.146.a: "Oh well."

rusd.147.t: "NRPR Goes Bankrupt"
rusd.147.d: "Boris Savinkov's NRPR has seen a meteoric rise in popularity during the past few years. All the massive rallies they constantly hold and armed paramilitaries they own are not free, however. Hoping to break from obscurity as quickly as possible, Savinkov and the NRPR took loan after loan to fund their political campaigns, and they hoped that they would be able to write off all of their debts upon coming to power. This has not happened and the National Populist movement has found itself severely indebted, with no way to pay off their staff or workers, and popular support for them waning because of ongoing economic stabilization.\n\nSavinkov was forced to lay off campaigners, disband many of the party's branches, and significantly cut the size of the Combat Squads. His movement has started to splinter, the left wing has broken off and its leaders began blasting Savinkov in national newspapers, accusing him of running the NRPR as a clique of yesmen...all in all, it has not been a good year for them. Popular support for the NRPR has decayed, their rallies have ceased, and their deputies in the Duma have chosen to ally with the Octobrists and Eurasianists.\n\nIt appears that Savinkov's hopes of taking power in Russia have been dashed for good."
rusd.147.a: "And nobody shed a tear."

rusd.148.t: "New Aristocracy"
rusd.148.d: "Though the noblemen in the Senate could defeat this terrible republic and restore the Empire, but they had to admit that the support of the new capitalists and industrialists played the significant role in this restoration. That's why it is the perfect time to show them our gratitude - the most powerful representatives of these classes, who helped us to strengthen the power of the Senate will get a title of nobility, which their descendants will be able to get as well."
rusd.148.a: "It's good to be a part of the elite!"

rusd.149.t: "Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy"
rusd.149.d: "In 1908 Grand Duchess Elizaveta Fyodorovna after the murder of her husband gave away her magnificent collection of jewels, including her wedding ring, and sold other possessions to found a Martha and Mary Convent of Mercy in Moscow, which started to assist sick, wounded, and maimed soldiers in their recovery, and to provide for the needs of the poor and orphans. This saint woman, who was killed in 1918 by the Bolsheviks, was de-facto a stepmother of her nephew Dmitriy Pavlovich, who decided to perpetuate her good deeds by making a great contribution into the Convent."
rusd.149.a: "It's all for you, Aunt Elizabeth..."

DM_Senate_support: "The President has started to transform Russia into aristocratic republic.\n"
DM_Can_Empower_Senate: "The Senate reforms were successful"

rusd.150.t: "'Triumph'"
rusd.150.d: "Ryabushinsky's Plant (also known as ZIR) is one of the major Russian automobile manufacturer, which also produced luxury vehicles in very low quantities, primarily for the officials and the other wealthy citizens of Russia. Though Black Monday seriously hurt the factory, the growing power of the aristocracy and businessmen made the market of the luxury vehicles once again very profitable for ZIR. That's why the name 'Triumph' was suggested for the new limousine ZIR-101, which the plant started to produce at the beginning of 1937."
rusd.150.a: "Vroom-vroom!"

rusd.151.t: "Noviy Kurs"
rusd.151.d: "Almost immediately upon assuming power as President, [ROOT.GetLeader] began looking into all the ways he could possibly expand his power while remaining in the trappings of the Constitution. The document has got enough errors that it did not take a long time - soon, the President appeared before the Duma again, this time to announce his "New Course" (Noviy Kurs). Under this reform program to the Constitution, the powers of the State Duma have been limited for an indefinite duration of time, and while they remain the main legislative organ in the state, they now have to share their powers with the Senate, which has received the power of legislative initiative, as well as the ability to promulgate executive orders bypassing the Duma outright. As the Senate is far more loyal to the new president than the Duma ever was, it means that [ROOT.GetLeader] has gained a powerful tool at his disposal in order to reform the state to his whim."
rusd.151.a: "Let it be."
rusd.151.b: "Better not destroy the democracy"
RUS_Senate_Warning_tooltip: "§RIf we fail in transforming our country to the aristocratic republic, [ROOT.GetLeader] will be forced to retire.\n§!"

rusd.152.t: "Elite Gymnasiums"
rusd.152.d: "Each city in the Russian Empire used to have a gymnasium, where the smartest children and the children of the local elite studied. With the republican reforms of Kerensky most of these schools were cancelled and all these students had to study together with the sons and daughters of the workers and peasants. The Senators claim that such elite gymnasiums should be restored to be sure that the best representatives of the next Russian generation will have perfect conditions for study. Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums..."
rusd.152.a: "Elite gymnasiums for the smartest children!"
rusd.152.b: "Public schools for everyone!"

rusd.183.t: "Tradition of the Masquerade balls"
rusd.183.d: "Masquerade balls were widespread among the Russian nobles and students before the revolution in 1917. With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprising is that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."
rusd.183.a: "This youth is beautiful as Russia itself."

rusd.184.t: "Mansions of the Aristocrats"
rusd.184.d: "The richest people of Russia, who are partially represented in the Senate could take back some of their mansions after the awful land redistribution in the Civil war, but they suffered a lot from the high land taxes of the Kerensky's regime. Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the policies of [ROOT.GetLeader]. There is a possible solution to this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."
rusd.184.a: "Let's hope nobody will notice this reform."
rusd.184.b: "The senators have enough money, they don't need state investments!"

rusd.185.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Assumes Power"
rusd.185.d.romanov: "Dmitriy Romanov, Grand Duke of the House of Romanov and member of the Senate, has been elected as the new President of Russia with a narrow majority of aristocrats, Russian nationalists, Eurasianists, and right wing Kadets. Playing the role of a "Modern Romanov", Dmitriy finds his appeal among conservative republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, both of whom see a savior in the man. After getting elected by the Senate, the Grand Duke declared it as his first intention to restore stability to the fallen nation - surprisingly, or perhaps not so, he made sure to omit any promises to support democracy in particular. Neither he nor the right-wing Senators who stand behind his back are all that thrilled with the democratic governance which the Left champions, although they're fine with paying lip service to it.\n\nThe people await the first actions of their new President."
rusd.185.d.notromanov: "[ROOT.GetLeader], an honorable member of the Senate, has been elected as the new President of Russia with a narrow majority of aristocrats, Russian nationalists, Eurasianists, and right wing Kadets. [ROOT.GetLeader] finds his appeal among conservative republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, both of whom see a savior in the man.

rusd.185.a: "Perhaps he can save Holy Russia."

rusd.186.t: "The National Bloc"
rusd.186.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader] has yet to get accustomed to his new duties and powers, which means that a large clique is starting to gather around him in hope that they will be able to use him to their interest. After negotiations, the VNS and a plethora of smaller political parties have chosen to join forces, gathering to a tight political alliance named the Conservative Bloc. Its political program calls for extensive political and social reform to maintain stability and prevent the growth of radical left wing forces, it is funded by several industrialist lobbies and supported by aristocrats.\n\nThe Conservative Bloc has thrown its full weight behind President [ROOT.GetLeader], granting him and his government a stable base of supporters in both houses of Parliament."
rusd.186.a: "It is time for a return to normalcy."

rusd.187.t: "Shattering the Democratic Opposition"
rusd.187.d: "Until this point, leaders and high ranking members of the "establishment" parties, namely the Kadets, Right SRs and VNS, have gotten away lightly. As long as they did not raise too much of a fuss, they were allowed to keep on living and doing their jobs. The extent to which Russia is rapidly being transformed to Savinkov's wishes intimidates them, as much as it did the socialists, and so they ultimately decided they had enough. Viktor Chernov, Pavel Milyukov and Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams have collectively drafted a manifesto in which they declared the formation of a Movement to Restore the Constitution and sent a demand to Savinkov to resign and allow free elections. \n\nSavinkov was not pleased, and the regime immediately moved against the democrats. A crackdown on democratic leaders has begun, numerous newspapers have been closed and their editors arrested, and the prisons overflowing with political arrests yet again. The downfall of the democratic constitutionalists left the last possible challenge to Savinkov's unquenched ambition dead in a ditch."
rusd.187.a: "It was not a matter of if. Only when."

rusd.188.t: "A Pious Curriculum"
rusd.188.d: "With secular education being firmly rooted in the material, it has left the sons and daughters of Russia without a proper moral compass in life, let alone a sense of higher spiritual purpose. A large portion of the generation that grew up in the wake of the civil war have therefore been left rudderless with grievous consequences, from alcoholism to public immorality.\n\nBy reintroducing faith and religious virtues into our national curriculum, we hope to undo these damages and better equip the coming generations of Russian children for the challenges that lie ahead. They shall meet their futures not only with the knowledge in their heads that they deserve, but with enough faith in their hearts to become upstanding subjects of God and Tsar alike."
rusd.188.a: "We must do our best to prepare Russia's children for the future."

### Savinkov Events ###
rus_fight_corruption: "Anti-Сorruption Raids"
rus_no_corruption: "Corruption Eradicated"

rusd.60.t: "Decree No. 1"
rusd.60.d: "Following the merging of the offices of the President and Prime Minister, the new master of destiny of Russia penned the first grand proclamation in his role as the Vozhd of All-Russia. The so-called 'Ukaz Vozhdya', also known as Decree No. 1, outlines an ambitious plan of reform of the Motherland through the use of both old institutions and newly created governmental positions. The disbanded Duma will remain in such state while the Senate shall be reformed into a more useful chamber in the future. All parties other than the NRPR are to be banned or merged into the structures of the People's Republican Party of Russia, a process hastened due to the help of recently officialised Combat Squads under the chief of the Ministry of State Security Victor Abakumov. According to Savinkov the aim of these reforms is the creation of a reborn Russia, a fairer nation free from corruption, capable of providing labor security and carrying out proper land reform."
rusd.60.a: "A true revolution for our nation."

rusd.70.t: "Cracking Down on Corruption"
rusd.70.d: "While our fair Motherland has never been truly free from corruption, one only has to look back into the times of Tsarist officials, the disaster that has been now-rotting Kerensky's regime ensured the worst excesses of materialist addicts reached their zenith. Military, civil service, governors and Duma members, all engaged in a vicious circle of bribery and favours for cash. We cannot allow such sorry state of affairs to continue, and thus with a new Ukaz our magnanimous Vozhd decreed that corruption is to be eliminated, with anyone found participating in such endeavours liable to be subjected to harsh penalties, and for worst offenders even the death sentence."
rusd.70.a: "No mercy for those who steal from the people."

rusd.124.t: "Volga-Volga"
rusd.124.d: "Volga-Volga is a Russian film comedy directed by Grigori Aleksandrov, released on April 24, 1938. Widely claimed to be Boris Savinkov's favourite movie, this classic musical comedy is a must-see. It centres on a group of amateur performers on their way to Moscow to perform in a talent contest called the Moscow Musical Olympiad. Most of the action takes place on a steamboat travelling on the Volga River."
rusd.124.a: "Funny enough to make the Vozhd smile!"

rusd.139.t: "Reforming the Senate"
rusd.139.d: "Time and time again, the Senate, a useless institution filled with decadent aristocrats holding back any change the Russian mass wanted to carry out, has proven itself to exaggerate any crisis our nation has found itself in. While we have gotten rid of the State Duma already removing the last vestige of the 'old' system may result in a backlash we are still not prepared to handle. That is why Boris Savinkov has once again decreed a new direction for the state, outlining an ambitious reform of the Senate into a chamber filled with representatives of the most important sectors of the Motherland, be it science, economy or military. It will also be overseen by an outside control council, staffed by NRPR loyalists, to ensure the institution shall never go back to its old corrupt methods."
rusd.139.a: "A new Senate for a new Russia."

rusd.198.t: "The Black Horse: A Novel"
rusd.198.d: "While Boris Savinkov has written many books throughout the years, all deeply influenced by the existential musings inherent in the poetry of the post-Narodist creators, only one of them captures the bleak reality of the Civil War and its influence on all who have gone through it. The 'Black Horse' is a profound examination of the Revolutionary and Counter-Revolutionary movements, penned in 1924 after the Vozhd had enough time to ponder his own experience during the conflict.\n\n'I have no home and no family. I have no losses because I have no property. And I am indifferent to many things. I don’t care who exactly goes to Yar - a drunken Grand Duke or a drunken sailor with an earring: after all, it’s not about Yar. I don’t care who exactly “gets rich”, that is, steals - a tsarist official or a “conscious communist”: after all, man does not live by bread alone. I don’t care whose power controls the country - the Lubyanka or the Okhrana Department: after all, who sows wind, reaps whirlwind... What has changed? Only the words have changed. Is it for vanity that one raises a sword?..'\n\n'We won. But there is no joy in me, no familiar intoxication: the Russians defeated the Russians. There is a white proclamation on the wall. I rip it off. It talks about us - “robbers” and “bandits”. And I ask myself: brother against brother or bug against bug?'\n\nAnd so the novel became a best-seller not only locally, but also in the West, for it is fundamental to understanding the political philosophy of Savinkovism. A product of the sadness connected with seeing his fellow countrymen kill each other, the rage against being treated like scum, disillusionment with the 'Green Armies', utter contempt towards the traitorous Communists. While the 'Pale Horse' may have, in a way, served as the death of a Revolutionary, the 'Black Horse' is a daring proclamation. A genuine expression of Russia's rebirth initiated by a man whose individualist nihilism gave way to a mass party, all due to the spiritual horrors of the Civil War."
rusd.198.a: "I understand why they hate. But why do I hate?"

rusd.199.t: "The Pale Horse"
rusd.199.d: "The first novel the now-Vozhd of Russia has written, 1909's 'Pale Horse' serves as a striking example of the Russian Silver Age in poetry, being deeply influenced by the collapse of the early incarnation of Narodism and Symbolist writers such as Zinaida Gippius and Dmitry Merezhkovsky. Recounting the memoirs of a Socialist-Revolutionary assassin back in the days of the First Russian Revolution of 1905, the novel is a thinly veiled autobiography of Savinkov himself, also allowing for a polemic as to the nature of political killing and the aims of the SR Combat Organization. Something which has drawn much ire from Boris' former party over the years, decrying the work as a spoof.\n\n'Happy is he who believes in the Resurrection of Christ, in the Resurrection of Lazarus. Happy is he who believes in socialism, in the coming paradise on earth. These old tales seem simply ridiculous to me: fifteen acres of apportioned land do not tempt me. I have said to myself: I do not want to be a slave. Is this my freedom? It is indeed a poor freedom! Why am I pursuing it? In the name of what do I go out to kill? Is it only for the sake of blood, and more blood?...'\n\nFrom such portrayal emerges a deeply complex and troubled soul, one unsure about his course in life, both past and present. The protagonist, George, exhibits strong individualism consistent with Savinkov's belief that only he can be the judge of his actions. He also inherits the Vozhd's disillusion with the PSR programme, Socialism as a whole, and religion. But also the will to pursue methods more akin to that of the Narodnaya Volya and utter nihilism, existing in a world between life and death where sin is no longer acknowledged and no love is held.\n\nAfter the rise of the NRPR, and their consolidation of power, printing of a new series of the 'Pale Horse' started, proving to be a major hit among the literate portion of our population. Perhaps the people simply want to understand what made Boris V. Savinkov the man he is today."

rusd.200.d: "Yesterday a new monument, built to commemorate one of Russia's greatest poets, has been uncovered in our capital.

rusd.201.d.noteur: "'Princypi Geopolitiki', published in the late 30's by Nikolay Trubetzkoy, is now considered a cornerstone of modern geopolitics. In his book the Russian conservative philosopher and politician envisioned a new Russian Empire. Defined not by the Tsardom or religion but rather by pragmatic control over the Eurasian continent. His ideas were further developed by Lev Gumilov thus creating the so-called Eurasian Doctrine."
rusd.201.d.eur: "Nikolay Trubetzkoy has published 'Princypi Geopolitiki'. This book will be a corner stone of modern geopolitics. In his book the great politician wrote about our future: Eurasian Empire. Defined not by the Tsardom or religion but rather by pragmatic control over the Eurasian continent.

rusd.202.d: "With the Russian situation slowly stabilising, some politicians, philosophers and scholars are attempting to revive the 19th century concept of Pan-Slavism, a vision of a united Slavic federation, centred around Russia. These ideas are gaining quick support among the conservative military officers, including Anton Denikin and Pyotr Wrangel."

rusd.204.d: "The first event marking Russian bilateral relations with Siam was the 1897 visit of King Rama V in Saint-Petersburg. Two years later, a permanent Russian embassy was established in the ancient Thai kingdom, serving as a certain symbol and guarantee of Siamese independence from foreign interference by the other great powers. Due to the turbulent times of the Weltkrieg and the Civil War, many ambassadors had to be recalled back to the Motherland, spelling the end of long relationships between our country and others around the globe. Perhaps it's high time to re-establish the cooperation we once had with the Thai people?"

rusd.205.d: "Emperor Nicholas II with his family was violently murdered by the Bolshevik maniacs, but his memory is embalmed in our hears. By a royal decree of [ROOT.GetLeader], the statue will be erected to the memory of Nicholas II and his family next to the Kremlin Wall at Red Square."
rusd.205.a: "Nicholas is underestimated."

rusd.206.t: "Reform the Russian Language?"
rusd.206.d: "The reform of the Russian spelling, first attempted by the Soviet government, was been cancelled soon after the Weltkrieg by the government of Kerensky. This decision has led to a situation where part of our citizens use the old written language, especially intellectuals, academics and nobles. The majority, however, use the reformed writing, considered illiterate and demotic by the ruling class. However, the reform has been planned since the early 1900s. This will help to establish the single written language all over the country and get rid of the remnants of the mass illiteracy."
rusd.206.a: "We shall implement the reform."
rusd.206.b: "Better stay with the old spelling."

rusd.207.t: "An Ancient Green for Our Newly Green Russia"
rusd.207.d: "An amazing archeological find has rocked the nation and our green government as new Scythian artifacts are being exhumed at ancient sites around the Black Sea. Alongside new pieces of art, jewelry, and other treasures made from bronze, gold, stone, antler, bone and wood, a peculiar and particular set of two bucket-shaped vessels dated back over 2,400 years ago made from gold has garnered the most attention. Thought to be the two main pieces of a Skythian water pipe, this find only further proves past theories and discoveries that tie the old Sycthian kingdom to cultural drug-use, with even the great Greek historian Herodotus writing about such practices in 430 BCE after his alleged visit to their kingdom, writing that ‘Scythians used a plant to produce smoke that no Grecian vapour-bath can surpass which made them shout aloud’. \n\nInitial tests on the black residue inside the two vessels show that it contains traces of both marijuana and opium smoke, while the outside of both pieces is engraved with artistic images of battle - with one adorned with a depiction of the famed Bastard Wars of old Scythia which saw warriors returning from battle with the true Persians that the original Skythians descended and fled from to find their lonely wives had borne children to their slaves back at home who were all inevitably slaughtered, while the other depicts a griffon tearing apart a horse and a stag which all are major animal symbols of the old kingdom. \n\nBefore this new discovery, the oldest water pipes or other similar paraphernalia like hookahs or bongs came from Ethiopia, being dated to between 1100 and 1400 BCE, but they were mostly not portable, with some even being built into structures as primitive cooling systems, making these Scythian artifacts the oldest portable water pipes known to mankind. Additionally, a dual burial site found years ago in the same digsite held not only dead bodies of the couple with their slaves and horses, but also an ornate bag of cannabis seeds dated back to between 700 and 300 BCE as well, further cementing this truth of Scythian cultural and societal drug consumption despite the first written appearance of water pipes not showing up until the Ming dynasty for use with tobacco over a thousand years later. \n\nWith this history in mind, should we embrace this part of Scythian heritage fully and allow our people to partake in the hallucinogenic pastimes of our ancestors, or shall we yield to more Orthodox views on the matter by appreciating the history without allowing such drug use in our pure state?"
rusd.207.a: "Embrace even this piece of Skythian heritage and culture."
rusd.207.b: "Respect our history but reject the use of this sinful decadence."

rusd.209.d: "With Lavr Kornilov quickly rising to power to become the leader of Russia, the split in the ROVS became even more serious. Two brilliant officers, Anton Denikin and Pyotr Wrangel are struggling to influence Lavr Kornilov and his politics.\nOn the one hand, Anton Denikin, Chief of Army, is looking forward to becoming Kornilov's right hand and either return to democracy or at least restore constitutional monarchy.\nOn the other hand, there is Pyetr Wrangel, who is Kornilov's Vice President in the ROVS and who seeks to restore absolute monarchy.\n\nBoth generals have supporters and will try to become Kornilov's head of government."

rusd.214.t: "Denikin Delivers Speech"
rusd.214.d: "Denikin has publicly delivered the speech to explain what had happened during the Civil War. He said that these were not pogroms, but terror against Bolshevik partisans. He added that it is not a secret that many Bolsheviks were Jews, so the actions were anti-Bolshevist and helped to win the war. He also added that he signed the decree banning Jews from joining the Russian Army because of existing anti-Semitic moods in the army, and not because of his own personal views. We could demand his resignation, but this may only fire up his supporters."

rusd.217.a: "Start the investigation."

rusd.218.t: "Wrangel Delivers Speech"
rusd.218.d: "Wrangel has publicly disposed of Denikin's argument, claiming that this is a complete lie and speculation as he has always been a Russian patriot. He also accused Denikin of having a groundless accusation and attempting to harass his political enemies."
rusd.218.a: "Better withdraw the suit from the court."
rusd.218.b: "He's definitely a spy, trust me."

rusd.219.t: "Judgement of the Court"
rusd.219.d: "The Court decided that Denikin's accusations of Wrangel are complete nonsense. There is no evidence that Wrangel is a German spy, so the case was dismissed."

rusd.109.t: "Renovating the Once-White Kremlin?"
rusd.109.d: "The Moskovskiy Kreml’ stands at the heart of Moscow - an iron and concrete citadel built by the Rurikids centuries ago that rises above the Moscow skyline as an imposing and wondrous example of Russian might. Housing palaces, cathedrals, gardens, administrative offices, and more, this impenetrable compound lies safely wrapped behind the great Kremlin Wall, guarded by the storied towers that give it its unique shape among the other tall buildings reaching into the skies of our capital. \n\nBefore the horrors of the Russian Civil War, the Kremlin was always painted a crisp and pure white, symbolizing its purity and regality as the political heart of the nation. However, as the fires of that bloody conflict burned, so too did our Kremlin, which was fired upon and besieged many times during the civil war. This conflict not only caused scorch marks and decay to wipe away this pristine paint, but has also caused much of the towers and major wall sections to fall into a state of disrepair and squalor - never being repaired or repainted for the Kremlin is as much a political symbol as a martial or national one, and the debate as to how to repair it and if to paint it White again has already been surround with ideological debate. With our state rebounding from the Civil War and the conflicts that followed, both martial and political, many within our cabinet have cried out that now is the time to restore this great fortress to a station of honor, for now we are easily in a position to be able to do so without economic setbacks or significant political pushback. Using funds recently acquired following our economic restructuring, we could launch a renovation and revitalization project to bring the Kremlin back to its state of original awe-inspiring glory. With a new coat of paint and with the entire premises repaired and restored, the Kremlin would once again rise to be one of the most secure and majestic fortresses on the planet. Alternatively, we can merely repair the least amount of facilities and structural damages possible to restore full function to the Kremlin, leaving it with the noble scars of war earned during our centuries-long history of survival and war. Regardless of our decision, the Kremlin shall forever stand as a bastion and beacon of Russian exceptionalism."

Once the loyal photographer of Tsar Nicholas II, Prokudin-Gorsky traveled the old Empire from 1909 to 1915 by train car gifted to him by the Tsar himself, snapping crisp and clear photographs of the Russian countryside using his unique 3-lens camera that, using pre-colored plates, provided rudimentary colored photos. Since then, he has served as a beloved artist, snapshotting windows into the Russian way of life, while also dabbling in his first love of chemistry in order to perfect his color-photo technique. \n\nRecently, given state funding and ample time to work in peace, Prokudin-Gorsky has created a stable, reproducible prototype for a full color camera based off the initial notes given to him by his contemporary James Clerk Maxwell, and it was this breakthrough that sealed his ticket to be honored tonight. With [RUS.getleader] meeting with him in person at a gala held in Moscow, Prokudin-Gorsky has been lauded as a Hero of the Russian Nation, and a banquet is to be held in his honor amid a gallery of his carefully curated best works - some of which are on generous loan from the American Library of Congress who held the only surviving negatives of some of his older works.

Kurchatov informs that foreign scientific journals have ceased any and all publications about nuclear research, even the most mundane reports, which can only mean that it has become confidential information and Russia's enemies must be actively developing nuclear armament. The only answer is to create a dedicated Russian nuclear weapons program - a request which Kurchatov and his peers have been granted. Under [Root.GetLeader]'s personal orders, new facilities have been opened deep in Central Siberia for the RDS-1 project - "Reaktivny Spetsialny Dvigatel" (Reactive Special Engine), which shall recruit Russia's brightest to develop a weapon with the power to manifest Apocalypse on Earth."

This strain of political thought proposes that Russia must transcend simply being a European nation, and that grander destiny is in store for a nation that spans two continents. Western-oriented reformism, as many of our forefathers sought, can't be used as a blueprint for governing such a vast and multiracial place.\n\nWith the hardships of Brest-Litovsk and the betrayal of the Entente, these Eurasianist ideas have gained a significant amount of traction in recent years, leading to calls to grant them and their ideas a place in our government. Doing so would orient our economic and foreign policies eastward towards Asia where we can earn new friends and expand into fresh markets, while still keeping a door open to the western Europeans should they finally adopt more rational policies towards us.\n\nBreaking with tradition and going forward with this decision is not without risks or controversy, with many of the intelligentsia actually still affectionate towards western culture, but it could very well open up doors to new possibilities for us in the future. It's useful that the mainline leaders of the Eurasianist movement, Nikolai Trubetzkoy and Pyotr Savitsky, have their own connections across aristocracy and academia respectively, and Konstantin Chkheidze, a front runner of the movement, is heavily amenable to the concept of a Eurasianist Monarchy. All the Eurasianists need now is some official support from the Tsar, and their movement is sure to flourish."
rusd.43.a: "The Eurasianists have earned a place in our administration."
rusd.43.b: "We see little point in adopting their radical and unproven ideas."

rusd.72.t: "Mass for the Motherland"
rusd.72.d.secular: "Despite our secular politics there are still some religious elements within the country that wish well for its future, no matter who is in charge of the government. Yesterday a small mass was dedicated to the prosperity of our motherland."
rusd.72.d.orthodox: "A small celebration dedicated to the prosperity of our Motherland has been performed yesterday in one of our towns. Even though it was very modest in scale and attendance, it attracted the conservative media's attention. Many common people consider this to be a visible sign of the Church's support for the Motherland."

rusd.74.d.not_monarchy: "A large scale celebration has taken place is our capital. Apart from thousands of common Russians, the Patriarch, members of the Romanov family and dozens of nobles, politicians and high-ranking officers have attended the mass. This is a great occasion to underline the ties between the government and the Church in these uncertain times."

rusd.153.t: "The Holy Coronation of Their Imperial Majesties"
rusd.153.d: "Today on [GetDateText], the day of the Coronation, in all the churches in [RUS.Capital.GetName], the liturgy was read and prayers of thanksgiving recited. The metropolitan cathedrals could not accommodate all the worshippers, in view of which prayers were also recited in the squares near a number of cathedrals and some churches, as well as in the Horse Guards.\n\nThe coronation ceremony began early in the morning, with the emperor seating on the throne on a special raised platform installed in the middle of the cathedral. The emperor sat on the throne of Tsar Mikhail Feodorovich\n\nAfter the coronation, the public post-coronation festivities were held, involving many people, both rich and poor, who praised the new emperor. In addition, a commemorative silver medal was established "In memory of the coronation of Emperor [RUS.GetLeader]".\n\nNow the Empire has been officially restored, led by our benevolent Tsar and the [ROOT.GetRulingParty]."
rusd.153.a: "A constitutional monarchy is just what we need to protect Russia!"

rusd.154.t: "The Rebirth of the Russian Tsardom"
rusd.154.d: "It has become clear that our nation's brief flirtations with the last century's liberal mantras have only brought us instability, uncertainty and a grievous lack of purpose as we stood without a proper leader to guite our people forward and face the challenges that lie ahead. The republican experiments of the past two decades wasn't meant to be.\n\nWith the return of the rightful Tsar on the Russian throne, our people will once again be guided by someone with a divine right to rule from here on rather than squabbling and the self-serving parliamentarians of yesteryear. With the upending of the old system, we can finally mend the damages caused by the events of 1917."
rusd.154.a: "Long live the Tsar!"

rusd.1541.t: "The Empire's Prime Minister"
rusd.1541.d: "As the Tsar cannot lead with the advice of God alone, the appointment of a capable Prime Minister as his primary advisor is of utmost importance and is something that must be made with great care and consideration as this man will wield great influence on the future of Russia. Out of the many subjects of the Tsar, the selection has been narrowed down to several potential men who are up for consideration.\n\nFirst, there's Vladimir Purishkevich, the ever-faithful leader of the black-hundredists. While his personality has certainly caused a great deal of controversy in political circles, his devotion to the Tsarist monarchy and hatred for Russia's enemies cannot be questioned in the slightest.\n\nOur second option is Vasily Shulgin, the leader of the VNS party, and whose appointment would guarantee us the support from his supporters as well as set forward a clear and conservative political trajectory for this administration. A notably influential figure alongside Shulgin in the conservative movement as well is Felix Yusupov, a personal friend of Dimitri Romanov who has leveraged his connection exceptionally well.\n\nAnother option is Pyotr Wrangel, a capable military mind whose service to the Tsardom is second to none and whose deeds may very well have saved us from the clutches of Bolshevism. With conflict looming on the horizon, his appointment would mean that we'd have one of Russia's foremost military minds as the Tsar's right-hand man at a very dire moment. \n\nLastly, there's Patriarch Sergius, whose high standing within the Church and nigh-peerless devotion to Christ would no doubt have a calming effect on the Empire after its recent instability. Appointing such a venerable religious leader would also instill a spirit of virtuosity in the Tsar's subjects through both words, deeds and policies.\n\nUltimately, the choice falls upon the Tsar to make his pick as to who will be given the high honor of serving Russia and taking on these important responsibilities."
rusd.1541.a: "Purishkevich, and his faithful Black-Hundredists!"
rusd.1541.b: "Yusupov, Dmitri Pavlovich's faithful friend since childhood!"
rusd.1541.c: "Shulgin, the shrewd leader of the conservative VNS!"
rusd.1541.e: "Wrangel, the White movement's most outstanding general!"
rusd.1541.f: "Patriarch Sergius, the Orthodox Church's voice!"

The first step on this road to our new destiny shall be to decide on a flag for our nation, with two main choices being available. We could either use our party banner, utilizing the symbol of Gorgulov’s own creation, or we could draw inspiration from our pagan roots to create a new flag to symbolize all the Russians under our care."

rusd.168.t: "Earth"
rusd.168.d: "Every single one of you, Russian citizens, should once ask himself. Who am I? Why do I exist? And I believe that the majority of you will find it hard to answer these questions. They are complex - and they are quite serious.\nBut I will give you the answer - you are an Eurasian person. You live at the joints of two major civilization - The European one and the Asian one. Our great country is the only ever existed country that had an amazing chance to contemplate how these two civilizations run into one.\n\nN.Trubetzkoy, 1928"
rusd.168.a: "We are special."

rusd.169.t: "Culture"
rusd.169.d: "Our cultural singularity cannot be view as European or Asian. Instead, it is Eurasian - a mixture, an alloy. We shall turn to our ancestors - children of Turan, children of Genghis Khan, brave warriors, equestrians and skilled workers. We shall never forget our origins and our roots. And we shall always remember who we are - the Eurasians.\nP.Savitsky, 1926."
rusd.169.a: "The sun rises in the East."

rusd.170.t: "Idea"
rusd.170.d: "I believe you understood my lessons right - the Principles you should always remember and never forget. Remember your origins - and remember who you are. The Idea is what rules the nation, what makes people fight in wars for their survival. The Idea that they can be free. That they can live, love, marry, earn their living. Our nation of Eurasians should be founded on a conscious idea, rather than materialistic ideals. And I want for every Russian, Ukrainian, Buryat, Tatar to remember this idea. We are Eurasians and we shall preserve our unique culture.\nG.Vernadsky, 1932"
rusd.170.a: "In the beginning was the Idea."

rusd.171.t: "Space"
rusd.171.d: "A unique combination of landscapes where our nation has been born is called Mestorazvitie. The tundra of Kola, the taiga of Olonets, the forests and steppes. An unlimited expanse of sea and the horizonless sky. Our Eurasian State is a living organism and it is natural for it to expand. The Space is the reason we have people speaking Russian in Harbin and Vladivostok, in Bokhara and Baku, in Warsaw and Lemberg. We shall protect our space - and we shall conquer more space.\nP.Savitsky, 1934"

### Zemstva Events ###

rusd.172.t: "The Investment Debate"
rusd.172.d: "The ability to help fund the Zemstva institutions is a double-edged sword. As it stands, the Zemstva only invest money they gain from local taxes, and if something happens, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetName] can always pin the blame on the local governor and have him replaced, without mentioning the advantages inherent in such a localized form of management. On the other hand, this does limit the scope of what they can achieve. The moment we step in, however, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetName] will be held responsible for anything that fails.\n\nFor this reason, some are recommending cautious - if any - investments on our part. While some cite the need to not get involved in every minor issue in every Siberian hamlet, more market-oriented ministers cite that the Zemstva have largely been doing just fine without our direct intervention and that the state should allow the local governance to function as intended. Other ministers, however, prefer a more direct approach by the government and insist that we can't let a handful of irresponsible career politicians blind us to the potential benefits we could reap by providing state funding to the Zemstva."
rusd.172.a: "Keep it small."
rusd.172.b: "Give them increased funding."
rusd.172.c: "Make a large investment."

rusd.173.t: "Direction of Investment"
rusd.173.d: "As we help expand the Zemstva institutions, new investment opportunities have opened up. Now we must decide where and how to direct our investments, in order to maximize their impact."
rusd.173.a: "Focus on bureaucratic matters."
rusd.173.b: "Fund industrial development of the region."
rusd.173.c: "Invest in local research facilities."

rusd.174.t.hospital: "Healthcare Expansion"
rusd.174.d.hospital: "Today marked the opening of a new hospital in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName]. As the more localized form of government under the Zemstva allows for local leaders to react more quickly and precisely to the needs of the local citizenry, the new hospital marks a fast response to what could otherwise have turned into a regional health crisis in the wake of our rapid growth. As living standards improve, so too will satisfaction with our government."

rusd.174.t.schools: "New Schools Opened"
rusd.174.d.schools: "Thanks to well-placed investments in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName], the state has seen a remarkable up-tick in schools built and teachers being trained. The rapid improvements being made to the education system has led to a marked improvement in the quality of life for the locals. Another success for the Zemstvo is another success for the government as well."

rusd.174.t.housing: "Zemstvo Housing Programme"
rusd.174.d.housing: "A housing program initiated by the local Zemstvo in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] has yielded positive results so far. Already we're seeing reports that homelessness is at a record low. As people's lives improve, so too will their patriotism. After all, fighting for their land is an easier sell when their government makes sure they have a roof over their heads."

rusd.174.t.civilian_industry_1: "Industrial Expansion"
rusd.174.d.civilian_industry_1: "With a Zemstvo consisting of many wealthy industrialists, [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] has seen considerable investments into building new factories in the region. These newly expanded industrial concerns have proved a boon to the local economy, and the expansion of industry in the region will inevitably be a boon to the state as well."

rusd.174.t.civilian_industry_2: "Economic Development"
rusd.174.d.civilian_industry_2: "The Zemstvo in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] have pooled their resources and expertise together and embarked on a major economic stimulus plan for the region. Millions of rubles have poured into local companies and the large up-tick in economic activity has acted like a magnet for outside investments as well. Stores and factories have opened in several cities and new railroads are bringing goods from one end of the region to store shelves across Russia. Naturally, these riches will inevitably trickle their way upstream to [RUS.Capital.GetName] as well."

rusd.174.t.military_industry: "Increased Arms Production"
rusd.174.d.military_industry: "Investments by the local merchants in modernizing production methods in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] have recently resulted in a large up-tick in productivity. With goods filling store shelves at record speeds, we should also count ourselves lucky that the benefits of these investments are trickling down to many of our state-run companies as well. More civilian goods are nice, but we're equally concerned with the more pressing matters of state defense."

rusd.174.t.civilian_industry_3: "Large Industrial Expansion in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName]"
rusd.174.d.civilian_industry_3: "[RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] has been the epicentre of what can best be described as a localized industrial revolution. A good investment climate, an abundance of expertise and a visionary ruling class has led to the gradual establishment of a new industrial concern in the region. Thousands of people now find themselves employed on these factory floors and goods are being produced at an astonishing rate. This is clearly a great success for our economic policies!"

rusd.174.t.infrastructure: "Infrastructural Improvements"
rusd.174.d.infrastructure: "A local governor in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName], appalled by the poor state of the roads in the region, has paid for the construction of new ones out of his own pocket. Over the past several weeks, labourers have put their shovels into the ground and helped to improve our infrastructure. The local papers may be praising his efforts, but it's ultimately the government in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] that reap the benefits of this act of generosity."

rusd.174.t.agriculture: "Increased Crop Yields"
rusd.174.d.agriculture: "New agricultural initiatives in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] have recently led to a large bumper crop this year! Store shelves are full and so are the bank accounts of the farmers! Of course, one way or another, a lot of the benefits of this abundant yield will trickle back to us in due time."

rusd.174.t.synthetics: "Breakthrough in Synthetic Oil"
rusd.174.d.synthetics: "It'd seem that the recent spending increases towards the Zemstvo has yielded a tremendous breakthrough! [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] report that they've established a synthetic plant, adding a healthy production to its fuel and rubber production. This will help keep the region's population more self-sufficient, and is already yielding large export profits. Naturally, this development is quite pleasing to our military industrial complex as well..."

rusd.174.t.failure_1: "Mismanagement Plagues a Zemstvo"
rusd.174.d.failure_1: "While more decentralized rule has its benefits, the lack of government oversight can sometimes have a negative side as well. We've recently been informed that many factories and companies in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] are poorly run due to gross mismanagement, a situation that unfortunately has flown under the radar for longer than it ought to have. While the governor of the region has stepped in to remedy matters, we're nonetheless left paying the price for not being able to stop this widespread neglect sooner."

rusd.174.t.failure_2: "Zemstvo Embroiled in Embezzlement Scandal"
rusd.174.d.failure_2: "Though our laissez-faire approach to economic matters has been a great boon to the economy, the lack of oversight means that sometimes the wealth being generated ends up in the pockets of crooks. [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] recently experienced this first-hand when a group of wealthy merchants used their wealth to buy their way into attaining considerable influence over the local Zemstva. With little oversight, they were able to embezzle a good deal of money meant to go to the state's coffers before law enforcement managed to shut their operation down. As their findings seem to indicate that this is merely the tip of the iceberg, however, it seems like we'll be battling this kind of corruption for the foreseeable future..."

rusd.174.t.failure_3: "A Zemstvo Needs a Bailout!"
rusd.174.d.failure_3: "A string of failed investments and poor planning has led to several key companies involved in a Zemstvo project going so far down into the red that we have no choice but to provide them with a government bailout to keep their projects from utterly falling apart. We'll just have to bite the bullet on this one, tighten our belts, pay up, and tighten our belts in the coming months ahead. Needless to say, the governor that greenlit this will have some explaining to do..."

rusd.174.t.industrial_research_failure: "Industrial Research Set Back!"
rusd.174.d.industrial_research_failure: "Our researchers in [RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] are reporting a major setback. The professors in the employ of the Zemstvo made a dire miscalculation in their assessments and it turns out (unfortunately only after extensive testing) that a lot of their hard work was based on a faulty premise. Unfortunately, some of our state-run research teams had used their work as a basis for their own projects as well, meaning that we're likely to see an overall slowdown of our research efforts in the months ahead."

rusd.180.t: "February Revolution Anniversary!"
rusd.180.d: "After the Civil War ended and Kerensky consolidated the power of the democratic coalition throughout the country, the day when the tsar abdicated, March 2 (according to the old style), began to be celebrated annually as a state holiday - Republic Day.\n\nOn this day, every year we celebrate the end of the autocracy, the power of the landowners and the aristocracy. The day is an official day off, during which festivals, folk games, and free banquets for everyone are held in the central squares of the cities. For many, this day is not only the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of Modern Russia, but also the beginning of Spring, when nature wakes up from a long and cold winter sleep.\n\nState flags and posters are hung up in cities, the annual presidential address is printed in newspapers in connection with the anniversary of the February Revolution, and in 1935 the president spoke for the first time on the radio, where he announced that our country is moving forward on the path of democracy and social justice.\n\nAt the end of the day, festive fireworks are thundering in many cities, the most colorful and largest of which is in Petrograd, marking the final and irrevocable end of the monarchy."
rusd.180.a: "Long live the Republic!"  

rusd.181.t: "Sergei Rachmaninoff Returns to Russia"
rusd.181.d: "Sergei Rachmaninoff, one of the most prolific Russian-born composers of the 20th century has finally returned to his ancestral homeland after almost 20 years of self imposed exile. The gifted pianist and romantic composer had fled Russia during the Russian Revolution, settling in New York City with his family after Social-Revolutionaries seized his personal estate as communal property; leading to Rachmaninoff leaving Russia and vowing never to return.\n\n With the Civil war in full swing, Rachmaninoff and his family have had many brushes with violence; with Rachmaninoff himself narrowly managing to escape Red Guard militias after they advanced on the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra while he was conducting his 3rd Symphony, only managing to escape due to red-guard members mistaking him for a Bolshevik émigré.\n\n The horrific violence that grips his adoptive home of America; coupled with a lucrative offer from a Petrograd based recording company and promise of a formal apology from SR representatives for the seizure of his property has moved Rachmaninoff to finally end his exile and return to his ancestral home of Russia.\n\n While Rachmaninoff had made himself at home in America, gradually gaining solvency and adjusting to the warmer climate in the United States (which was more suitable to him due to a myriad of health issues); he will now bid America adieu and continue on with his musical endeavors in the concert halls of Moscow and Petrograd; and while the aging composer still holds out hope that he can return to America once the violence ceases, the chances of such an occurrence grow slimmer by the day."
rusd.181.a: "While he has returned under tragic circumstances, we welcome him home."

rusd.182.t: "For Motherland and Freedom"
rusd.182.d: "The 1918 was, according to Boris Viktorovich himself, the most incredible year in the history of Russia. The Bolsheviks managed to suppress the armed revolt of the SRs in Moscow, Rybinsk and Murom, destroying a number of its prominent organizers. Savinkov himself, thanks to his brilliant talent for 'reincarnation' and conspiracy, managed to escape from the Chekists' capital, although, it would seem, his life hung in the balance. When checking his documents, he was detained by the Chekists, but with the composure of a real werewolf, the terrorist presents them with a fake mandate from an employee of the Moscow CHEKA. And at the same time, he demands that they assist him in finding Boris Savinkov, the worst enemy of the Soviet government! Having received a horse and a guide from his "comrades", this truly "adventurer" safely reached Kazan, which by that time had already been captured by Kappel's People's Army.\n\nSavinkov was not alone in Kazan. The members of the central staff of his \"Union\" - SZRS or the Union for Motherland and Freedom, General Rychkov and Colonel Perkhurov, who survived the defeat in Rybinsk, also arrived here. All of them, like Savinkov, offered their services to yesterday's enemies, the monarchist Kappel and the White Guard. Despite their different interests, they were all united by their hatred of the Bolsheviks, whom they considered usurpers who had illegally gained power. That is why the paths of such seemingly irreconcilable enemies, the monarchist Kappel and the socialist-revolutionary Savinkov, converged.\n\nSavinkov always remained a man of action and did not sit idly by at the most crucial moments. Perhaps, like no one else, he understood well that now that Kazan was in the hands of the Whites, further delay was like death, and that at all costs it was necessary to continue the offensive in order to capture the railway bridge at Sviyazhsk. Here, the Reds, having recovered from a series of defeats and the loss of Kazan, were preparing a counteroffensive. It was here in those hot days that the chairman of the Strategic Missile Forces, Lev Trotsky, arrived on an armored train, for whom Savinkov felt almost pathological hatred.\n\nTogether with Kappel and Fortunatov, Savinkov developed a plan for a raid on Sviyazhsk and was personally involved in the combat operation. On that foggy morning of August 29, 1918, when Kappel's White Guard detachment broke through to the rear of the Reds, Savinkov himself, as part of a cavalry squadron, stood in ambush, hiding in the woods near Kazan, at the Observatory crossing. His task was to impose a battle on the left-bank red group in order to distract their forces from the Kappelites rushing to Sviyazhsk. Soon, a dugout train with Red Army soldiers approached the departure. The red fighters who poured out of the wagons could not think of anything better than to start a rally right under the barrels of machine guns of the whites, who were watching them through binoculars, hiding behind pine trees.\n\nThe revolutionary "discipline" led to the fact that the Reds did not even bother to set up patrols. For which they paid in full: having imperceptibly surrounded the protesters, the Whites opened sudden dagger machine-gun fire on them. Savinkov, clinging to the Vickers, personally shot the rushing Red Army soldiers. A few minutes later, it was all over — the clearing near the station was covered with the bodies of the dead, and the remnants of the Reds, firing randomly, retreated towards Paratsk."

russia.3678.t: "Cosmism Spreads in Popularity"
russia.3678.d: "Russia is a land full of radicalism, creativity, and an ever-broadening concept of the human experience, making our wild nation home to all sorts of strange and varied movements. From the Social Futurists to the God-Builders, many of these movements have tied themselves to Russian Socialism and Bolshevism, but one movement in particular has been gaining popularity across the state. \n\nCalled Cosmism, this new philosophical and cultural wave emerged at the turn of the 19th century, and has since expanded and diversified as we have marched through the decades, with the movement branching out into the fields of science, art, philosophy, and even theology more rarely. Based on notions tied to Transhumanism, Futurism, Panpsychism, Interplanetary Travel, and Cosmological Evolution, Cosmism was first inspired by Science Fiction authors such as Jules Verne and H.G Wells, but has since evolved into a true movement. \n\nWith the early forefathers of this new wave of thought such as Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov, Nikolai Kibalchich, Vladimir Solovyov, and Konstantin Tsiolkovsky all having passed on, the Russian Cosmists have floated around, tying themselves to different Socialist groups such as the Prolekult and the Left-Eurasianists, taking on new ideas along the way. For instance, Alexander Bogdanov - Bolshevik theorist and physician - has long tinkered with the idea of using blood transfusions in order to extend human life expectancy while the followers of the late Tsiolkovsky instead push for interplanetary travel, stellar exploration, and cosmic colonization. Others like Alexander Chizevsky have dabbled with the idea of Heliobiology, or studying how the Sun and its solar rays impact biology and evolution here on Earth, while some have left the physical realm entirely to theorize on the beyond, such as Vladimir Vernadsky and his notion of the Noosphere - a new geological layer formed from human thought and evolved rationality called the Sphere of Reason that represents the highest form of biospheric development. Additionally, there are those who fuse Cosmist ideas into other fields, including Nikolai Aleksandrovich Kozyrev who folds Cosmism into his work as an astronomer and lunar scientist, Ivan Yefremov who infuses Cosmism into his work as a sci-fi author and paleontologist, or the composer and mystic Alexander Scriabin who believes in the centrality of music’s role in philosophy and focuses on how music and spirituality can be transformative powers in pursuit of Cosmist goals. Though wildly varied and differing in their views and goals, these strange Cosmist groups and figures all share one foundational idea - that a purely Socialist society is the only type of society that can provide the necessary structures needed for these ideas to flourish and carry humanity onwards to the next step of our evolution."
russia.3678.a: "An interesting group of theories, but not something to focus on."

orth.1.t: "Faith and Nation"
orth.1.d: "Our Government's religious policies have been popular, both among our own people and abroad. They show how our Faith can bring order and stability to societies in this chaotic modern world. There are now a variety of political groups in neighbouring countries following a new form of politicised Orthodox Christianity. A loose organisation, calling itself 'Faith and Nation', has grown within Russia and is training activists and paramilitaries from these organisations, with the aim of developing their principles and forming an international brotherhood of Orthodox nations. While this could lead to international complications, it may provide an opportunity for Russia to acquire a firm position and role within the world once more."
orth.1.a: "Let them operate, they are backed by the Clergy after all."
orth.1.b: "Promote peaceful religious groups in Russia instead."

orth.2.t: "The Most Holy Governing Synod"
orth.2.d: "Prime Minister-Patriarch Kirill provoked a major crisis and has threatened to resign his position unless the Synod of the Russian Church be allowed to exercise veto power on all new legislation. He has also demanded that the monasteries should benefit from public taxation and that priests should be granted a high salary, paid for by the state."
orth.2.a: "We have no choice but to agree."

orth.3.t: "Holy Rus"
orth.3.d: "The power in the country lies totally in the hands of the priests and clergymen. Our ultimate goal, to create the Kingdom of God on Earth, is almost done. For many centuries Moscow was the Third Rome and now we can proudly claim that we are the New Jerusalem. The treason of the Bolsheviks and indifference of the Republicans never stopped us and the Russian Orthodox faithful from retaining who we are - Children of God. Our divine plan for man, our divine justice is clear, because it is dictated by God."
orth.3.a: "God With Us!"
orth.3.b: "The Patriarch shall rule supreme!"

orth.4.t: "Our Flag"
orth.4.d: "With Russia under the guidance of the Clergy we must now decide on a new flag to better represent our Kingdom of God right here on these wretched lands. There are two designs proposed, the first is the tricolor with a canton that incorporates the Russian cross, while the second design uses the black and yellow tricolor while depecting St. George slaying a dragon."
orth.4.a: "Go with the first design!"

russianews.1.d: "A few days ago, Lavr Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away in his sleep. With Kornilov’s death, Prime Minister Boris Savinkov, appointed by Kornilov, used his power in the government to merge the post of Prime Minister and President, becoming the first Vozhd of Russia. Savinkov and his ‘People's Republican Party of Russia’ (NRPR) had been growing in influence in Russia long before Kerensky’s death. The NRPR and Savinkov have promised to free Russia from the chains of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and bring the Russian people to their former glory. It is unclear how his plans will unfold, however, one thing is clear - Boris Savinkov is now the undisputed leader of the new Russian State."

After hours of bloody street fighting, Kornilov took full control of Moscow and was sworn in as Supreme Commander-in-Chief and President of Russia."

russianews.3.d: "Fearing a general collapse of Russia, Field Marshal Pyotr Wrangel and his regiment marched into Moscow. In a bloodless coup, Wrangel convinced the Duma and the Senate to hand over power to himself, then invoked Article 48 of the Constitution to suspend civil liberties and establish martial law. With the Duma and Senate in Wrangel's control, a de-facto military dictatorship has been established in Russia."

So, ultimately, army officers led by Lavr Kornilov and others launched a coup, detaining the politicians and dissolving the Duma.\n\nHowever, it seems that the army vastly overestimated its support. Massive protests and armed insurrections proved fatal against Kornilov's coup, who was forced to surrender Moscow to the left-wing forces.

Pyotr Nikolayevich Wrangel, the famed 'Black Baron' of the Baltic-German noble stock in service of the Russian Empire ever since his father's role as adjutant to the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovitch, now sits atop the Tsardom's throne.\n\nAs one of the major figures within the White Movement and the ROVS organization ever since the Civil War, Baron Wrangel has made many allies within the aristocracy and monarchist officer corps. His rising popularity amongst the common people of Russia and close ties with major conservative politicians eventually resulted in him being once again tied to the restorationist cause, just like his Bolshevik enemies sang about during their struggle.\n\nYet contrary to what many could have then expected, Pyotr Wrangel has neither taken autocratic reins of All-Russia nor has he restored a Romanov by himself, but he has been chosen by both certain elements the establishment and the people to lead the restored Russian Empire. Many now wonder how the jump from a Baron to a Tsar will affect the man himself, wider Russia and even the World."

Given that the Ottomans are facing challenges in other areas, this development is unlikely to favor them. However, it is premature to draw conclusions or make predictions. Will Russia succeed in regaining its influence in the Caucasus and Middle East, or will the Sick Man of Europe continue to resist?"

Though expensive and fragile, we have been able to send a few models to the major allies, allowing our armies and the armies of our friends to utilize this unique technology to further our ambitions. With our growing airfleet also using autogyros, rotabuggies, and other novel transports devised by crack scientists and our allied lackeys, we shall be able to ferry our populace, our goods, and our troops all around the world without issue or delay while also delivering devastating payloads at a moment’s notice.

These ‘hoverflies’ are unique aircraft that can take off and land vertically, and have been dubbed helicopters or advanced autogyros by the initial designers. Primarily designed to quickly ferry supplies and precious cargo in and out of rough areas and terrain, some of these helicopters have also been out-fitted with weaponry, functioning as basic light aerial gunships and bombers while also being adept at recon and supply. Looking more like something out of Da Vinci’s sketchbooks and less like a real war machine, we shall give these new helicopters and the other tech the Russians sent us a thorough testing against the varied enemies of our alliance."

If not for them, we would have already got everything done.\n— Are you against the monarchists?\nHe was embarrassed and silent.\n— Against the monarchists, but for a Tsar?\n— For a Tsar? I'm not for anyone. I am not involved in politics. I'm a soldier. I will never recognize the Brest Peace and will never take off my epaulettes. I don't give a damn about the rest.\nHe gets angry. He feels that he is wrong in something, but he cannot comprehend what his mistakes are.:\n— Ah, Volodya, Volodya. It's good to be a colonel, to ride a horse, to dine at Kyub's and look after the ladies in a city. It is also good to shoot down the Hungarian cavalry from a trench. But it is bad to be not even White, but just a bandit, to fight workers in the streets, without a Tsar on the throne and in the head. Is this what we are fighting for?\n— I only know for sure, that constant speeches, squabbles and, again, speeches won't lead us anywhere. Your Nobleness.\nThen he stands silent. The most difficult thing here is that he’s not wrong."

rusdroz.2.b: "We need strength, and we need it now. Cheer up our soldiers."

rusdroz.3.t: "Plans for a Coalition"
rusdroz.3.d: "Invitations were sent and plans for several negotiations were set. Now we can only pray that ours’ allies demands won’t be too much for us to agree, or this idea of a monarchist coalition will be doomed even before the start."
rusdroz.3.a: "We need them, starting with Nikolay Markov"

rusdroz.4.t: "A Meeting with Nikolay Markov"
rusdroz.4.d: "Nikolay Yevgeniyevich was a pedantic man, even in his old age. With grey moustache a la Peter the Great, he radiated with energy and insolence. His demands were clear from the beginning:\n— No dismissal for Black Hundreds! Actually, we will use them in direct actions on the streets. We need to show all these Bolsheviks and Anarchists that there won’t be a new 1917 and all they can get is a hammer in their skull. Give my men the rifles."
rusdroz.4.a: "We agree"
rusdroz.4.b: "More rifles on the streets? You are madman!"

rusdroz.5.t: "A Meeting with Purishkevich"
rusdroz.5.d: "With his arms folded at the elbows, Vladimir Purishkevich said loud and clear, as he always does:\n — Autocratic monarchy proved itself outdated and unnecessary. People won’t buy it anymore, Mikhail Gordeyevich, and you know it yourself too well. People won’t forget the Republic and the only way to restore a Tsar is to guarantee parliamentarism won’t be abolished, to guarantee their voice will be heard anytime. Consider this my only demand."
rusdroz.5.a: "We'll see when we get to the point when we can safely talk about reforms."
rusdroz.5.b: "No, Vladimir Mitrofanovich. Just no."

rusdroz.6.t: "Negotiations with Engelgardt"
rusdroz.6.d: "Boris Engelgardt light his cigarette and smiled. Perhaps, the most unneeded by Drozdovsky, this politician represented the Centre of the monarchists. Engelgardt was a progressive man, to the point of accepting the reality of the Republic and supporting Kerensky for the sake of continuation of Russia’s war against Germany.\n — I know what you might be thinking about right now, Mikhail Gordeyevich, — he said, — You think: what an insolent bastard this Boris Aleksandrovich is. But let me say this, our conflict of interests is the conflict of the past and the future. You are the past, general, and don’t argue with me. The only monarchist option I will genuinely support is Vladimir Kirillovich. He’s just like me, and he knew the consequences of what his reigning relatives were doing back in 1917. That’s why he accepted the February Abdication."
rusdroz.6.a: "We agree"
rusdroz.6.b: "You’re right, you are an insolent bastard. I can’t accept the traitor on the throne."

rusdroz.7.t: "Results of Our Initiative"
rusdroz.7.d_success: "With a heavy heart, we agreed on the terms monarchist leaders demanded and now the coalition is formed. For a time of troubles, political squabbles will be stopped, but we can't say for how long this calm will last."
rusdroz.7.d_fail: "Manshtein was right all along! Politicians will lead us anywhere but success! All this insolent, stupid bastards that try to look so smart and noble have nothing on their mind but their pride and their very own foolishness. Away with the Democracy! Now the reigh of our guns begins!"
rusdroz.7.a: "We reap what we sow"

rusdroz.8.t: "Drozdovites Rule Alone"
rusdroz.8.d: "The streets lie silent for now. But anyone can say that there is something that coming for Russia. Everyone talks about it, everyone feels it. It's in the air. Soldiers of Drozdovsky's Regiments are staying on the crossroads, watching the crowds, holding rifles in their hands. You can see their hands tremble with tense. If there is a rifle on a scene, it absolutely must shoot during a play."
rusdroz.8.a: "Lock n' Load"

rusdroz.9.t: "Denikin and his Clique are Purged"
rusdroz.9.d: "We can't trust Denikin. He saw his intentions during the War with Bolsheviks. We don't need that lousy and sneaky bastard who easily accepts the false Republic and forgets his oath."

rusdroz.9.b: "His fellows shall serve the motherland well from Urga"
rusdroz.9.c: "Take his honest word and let him go"

rusdroz.10.t: "Markov and his Clique are Purged"
rusdroz.10.d: "You understimate us, General Markov! That's were the words Drozdovsky said to him, when this staunch republican whined about the large amount of tsarist soldiers and officers among the ranks of Volunteer Army back in the times of Civil War. Now, this is the time we can show him the true meaning of our words."
rusdroz.10.a: "He can join his beloved republic, in hell"

rusdroz.11.t: "Kornilovites are Purged"
rusdroz.11.d: "Kornilovites remain loyal to the Usurper and most of them are republicans. We can't let them just command the Imperial Army, where they can organize plots and conspiracies against us."
rusdroz.11.a: "We will not tolerate the lackeys of a traitor"

rusdroz.12.d: "Wind has cleaned the evidences, the footprints, shovel marks, rifles' cases. Those who were left alive or escaped, hide in their dark caves, waiting for what we do next.

rusdroz.13.t: "Army Mutiny"
rusdroz.13.d: "Gunshots! Artillery barrage! Cossack with a brave smile, with a sabre, on a sword, chops heads of the soldiers in red-white caps. With the people's praise, counter-coup has won and Drozdovites run scattered and wounded."

rusdroz.16.t: "Arrest of Mensheviks"
rusdroz.16.d: "Despite the fact that Mensheviks don't call for workers' revolution right away and their low support leaves them dangerous for us, we still carpet-ban them as every other socialists."
rusdroz.16.a: "No one can hear them scream"

rusdroz.17.t: "Arrest of Maria Spiridonova"
rusdroz.17.d: "Spiridonova didn't surrender without a fight. Shootout broke up between Drozdovite soldiers and Left-SRs militants. A lot of civilians got wounded and killed in the process, as both sides shoot anything that moves in their eyes' sights."
rusdroz.17.a: "No negotiations with terrorists"

rusdroz.18.t: "Nikolay Bukharin Escaped"
rusdroz.18.d: "Leader of the NSP, Nikolay Bukharin was ahead of us, and before the wave of arrests started, escaped to Finland, using NSP secret agent nets. He probably won't stay in Finland long and will run as far as he can."

rusdroz.19.t: "Total Ban on Socialist Parties"
rusdroz.19.d: "With the latest decree of Drozdovsky's junta, all socialist, revolutionary or not, parties were banned from participating in any kind of politics, local and all-Russian governments; their newspapers must be shut down and public meetings or every expression of Anti-Russian 'Bolshevik-SR' ideology are prohibited."

rusdroz.20.d: "At about five o'clock in the morning, of the Drozdovite officers, only Manshtein and several other people were in the palace. Guards' commander again turned to Manshtein:\nThe soldiers are tired, and there is no end in sight. What if we stop this chatter?\nManshtein thought a bit and waved his hand:\n- Stop it, and tomorrow we'll figure it out!\nGuards' commander entered the hall through the left side entrance, slowly went up to the presidium, walked around the table behind and touched Milyukov on the shoulder. Loudly, to the whole room, in an unobjectionable tone he said:\n- The guard is tired. I ask you to stop the meeting and go home.\nMilyukov muttered something in confusion. The deputies began to make their way to the exit. Nobody even asked if there would be a next meeting."

rusdroz.21.t: "Attacks on Oppositional Newspapers"
rusdroz.21.d: "Series of attacks woke up the major cities. Drozdovite soldiers were burning publishings, throwing out people and papers.

rusdroz.23.d: "In the autumn of 1918, during the Second Kuban Campaign, there was an officer that got in hospital with a heavy wound. Nobody expected him to survive, but he endured. Without the arm, lopsided, he looked comical in the ranks. Fragments that didn't kill him, managed to harden him. He found himself being called one-handed demon, the slayer of commissars. He single-handedly destroyed the rails, leading to a train with Bolsheviks crushing, and then shot every single survived red soldier.\n If there is someone, who can hate socialists more than Drozdovsky, it will be him"

rusdroz.25.t: "The Implacable"
rusdroz.25.d: "They killed three of his brothers. They betrayed the Rus, they are proud of that they have no Motherland, they desecrate everything that is sacred and destroy everything that is built. There will be no peace until any of them exists. There will be no honor until the shame of Brest Peace and Bolshevik Uprising will be washed off with blood and sweat.

rusdroz.26.t: "Turkul Bureau"
rusdroz.26.d: "Even though Anton Turkul, switched his place from the battlegrounds to cabinets of military intelligence, he still fights the fight that is might be even harder than shootouts. His army of analysts and spies will be the new apparatus of our military and counter-intelligence."

rusdroz.33.d: "- Russia is being destroyed?\n- Yes.\n- Do the churches being robbed?\n- Yes, they do.\n- Are you being massacred?\n- Yes, we are.\n- Why don't you rise up?\nThe young peasant who was talking to me shrugged his shoulders and asked me in turn,\n- Have you been at the front? Have you been in battles?\n- Yes.\n- What do you think is a battle without artillery?\nIt was true. In some villages, rifles brought from the front have been preserved. Even machine guns have been preserved in some places. But how should the peasants organize themselves? There are almost no roads. There are crowds of people who hate the enemies."

rusdroz.36.d: "\"One good shout, and everyone will fall into place... They are all cowards, they only rebel because everyone is afraid of them. And if they saw the hardness, they would hide now... But in St. Petersburg they don't dare, they are afraid there themselves. The real reason for the revolution there is fear, weakness...\nNow this manifesto has been thumped. The Constitution! They think this will calm you down. Crazy people! Is it possible to calm down with an obvious expression of fear. Who to calm down? Dreamy constitutionalists. These will not go into trouble anyway, and this will not calm the dynamiters. On the contrary, now they will take wing, now they will lead the assault.\nI'm not talking about the substance anymore. It's done. You can't bring it back. But how long Russia will last without autocracy - who knows. Will "constitutional Russia" stand up to some formidable test?.. \"For the Faith, the Tsar and the Fatherland" - they died, and this created Russia. But that they would go to die \"for the State Duma\" is nonsense.\nBut this is ahead. Now repel the assault. Because there will be an assault. Now they will climb.

rusdroz.38.t: "By Sword"
rusdroz.38.d: "Black Hundreds since the day they were found, have always were a decentralized local force formed by urban patriots. To coordinate their patriotic will and desire to protect the Holy Rus, we'll start the reorganization of Black Hundreds, turning them into something more than paramilitary crowds.

rusdroz.39.d: "By Order of the Ruler of Russia and its State, Mikhail Drozdovksy, has decreed formations of autonomies.

rusdroz.40.t: "Crackdowns on Leftists in Moscow"
rusdroz.40.d: "The morning today started with a siege of what was suspected as a headquarters of an anarchist and revolutionary cell. Doors were blocked with anything Black Hundredists could find and the fire was lit to smoke out barricaded anarchists. The news have spread and soon the whole city was the battleground between monarchists and socialists, leaving hundreds of people dead and thousands injured.\n\n But at least, we liquidated another revolutionary cell."
rusdroz.40.a: "There is a shootings on the streets, honey, don't go outside"

rusdroz.41.t: "Ufa Pogrom"
rusdroz.41.d: "Outrageous news coming from Ufa, the capital of Bashkiria - few days ago local cell of anti-monarchists, formed by socialists and islamists, probably, funded by the Ottomans, tried to murder local city head. Our loyal militiamen answered with a pogrom, litting the fires and killing and beating every suspected 'Bolshevik' on the street."
rusdroz.41.a: "Violence raises"

rusdroz.42.t: "Murder of Sergey Kirov"
rusdroz.42.d: "On a dark night, in the cold streets of Petrograd, Sergey Kirov would wait on a bench, shrouded in a dark coat and a long hat. It was not the usual spot where Kirov would meet his informants, but the letter he had received detailed something urgent with regards to his fellow comrades who had recently been arrested by the State; there was no time to waste, it seemed. After what had seemed like a millennia, Kirov would perk up at the sound of pacing footsteps. Down the street, and quickly approaching him, was a man clad in all black, just as he was. ‘’Hold on, let me see your face first-’’ A bullet would silence the former Bolshevik as it pierced through his chest. As he laid on the bench, wide-eyed and gasping for breath. As soon as he had appeared, the assassin was now gone. The NSP were now without a figurehead to lead them, and the Drozdovites are on their heels."
rusdroz.42.a: "Another Judas got his reward tonight"

rusdroz.43.t: "Red Uprising in Petrograd and Moscow"
rusdroz.43.d: "The reaction on the killing of Sergey Kirov was the loudest in the recent years. Few days since the murder has happened, in the night, thousands of socialist activists and their Red Guards came out to the streets in an attempt to capture Moscow and Petersburg important places like City center, Post stations, Ports and Garrisons fortifications. Luckily, our soldiers managed to beat them back and now both of our Capitals are battlegrounds for fierce battle of rifles, artillery and armored cars."
rusdroz.43.a: "Rus once again hangs by a thread!"

rusdroz.44.t: "At the Ruins"
rusdroz.44.d: "On the banks of the Neva, the once-great metropolis of Saint Petersburg burns in an immolating maelstrom of chaos of napalm. What was at one time the famed ‘Window to the West’, the ‘Venice of the North’, and the ‘City of White Nights’ has now been turned into nothing more than a city of ash and bone, laid siege and brought to ruin by anarchists and bolsheviks. From landmarks such as the Alexander Column and the Hermitage Theatre to the opulent Marble, Yusupov, and Yelagin palaces, all common people's neighbourhodds in this famed Petrograd has been either scarred by fires and fired lead, or utterly reduced to rubble. Not a soul can be heard amongst the ashen plains and mountains of rubble - it was but a week ago when the city was as vibrant and radiant like none other. As news of the destruction rapidly spreads across the nation and worldwide, we are met no longer with outcry - instead, a shallow silence.\n\nAs our soldiers walk across the barren stretches of nothingness, most are reminded of another aptly-given name for the old capital - the ‘City Built On Bones’. However, this is no time for mourning. Already, Marshal Drozdovsky has proclaimed, with the socialist taint now firmly vanquished, Russia is now free to step forth into a new age unlike any other. Petrograd will be rebuilt to be grander, and greater - a city ordained by God himself."
rusdroz.44.a: "Piter shall be rebuilt in marble and gold from this ash and cinder."

rusdroz.45.t: "Felix Yusupov Connections"
rusdroz.45.d: "The Romanov Dynasty is opulent and affluent, but even these lords of All Russia are not the wealthiest in our lands. For decades, the Yusupov family has reigned as one of the wealthiest families in the nation, and with their esteemed standing and access to great wealth, aligning with this powerful family would be of great use to the state. \n\nCurrently, the House of Yusupov is primarily rallied behind Prince Felix Yusupov, patriarch of the family and chief of their finances. Ever the flamboyant and eccentric noble, Felix is an educated and free-spirited man infamous for his role in the death of Rasputin and for his social outings and escapades, but nonetheless has also proven to be a shrewd financier. By drafting agreements with this aristocrat, we shall establish a new monetary slush fund for our government to draw from using Yusupov family assets and capital, and in exchange, Felix Yusupov has been given a position within the Russian government, full absolution for his role in the murder of Rasputin, and he has been given great liberties and benefits that shall allow him to continue his odd lifestyle, so long as he keeps his more outlandish behaviors away from the public eye. With this arrangement, our resurging empire shall have far greater access to the funds it needs to truly flourish as we crusade to reclaim the glories of old Imperial Russia."
rusdroz.45.a: "Once hated by the Tsarina, and now utilized by the Tsar."

rusdroz.46.t: "Legacy of Minin"
rusdroz.46.d: "When we look back on the legacy of our great nation, many heroes and icons of the Russian people appear. During the Time of Troubles, a dark age for our people, there was one man who stood out like a light in shining darkness; Kuzma Minin - a man of the Kupechestvo who rallied men under the Imperial banner to support the Prince Dmitry Pozharsky against the invading Poles. A symbol of Russian patriotism, he is a man deserved of respect - and what better way can this be shown than through fostering closer bonds with the Kupechestvo?\nAlready we have begun to supply the merchants with shipments of rifles in exchange for their generous ‘donations’ to the state. We are always in need for additional sources of income, but to do so in remembrance of this hero of our past is an honor no other administration before us had."
rusdroz.46.a: "The legacy of Minin and Pozharsky lives on in new Russia!"

rusdroz.47.t: "One Party to Rule Them All"
rusdroz.47.d: "In an effort to bring further unity to the Russian people, Drozdovsky along with his cabinet and closest allies have ordered the merger of every single political party, along with every related entity attach to these parties into the All-Russian Popular Union. While this move, as was expected, is quite unpopular, many have expressed gratitude at the merger. Unlike the monstrous Bolsheviks who would have simply banned these same parties and hunted down their leadership, or the meddling Republicans who, while allowing these parties to exists, would never have allowed them to share power, which they so greedily held onto. With every party merged into one entity, it ensures that every man will truly be represented, while also allowing a degree of freedom of debate. Regardless, the removal of party politics shall surely bring a true unity to the Russian people, who have so long suffered division at the hands of these petty parties."
rusdroz.47.a: "...and in the Darkness bind them"

rusdroz.48.t: "The Russian People are United"
rusdroz.48.d: "The Flags wave proudly in every city while in villages that once were on the border of contesting states the villagers get together and celebrate. The celebrations are for the simple reason of the Russian peoples finally being united together under one state, rather than a bunch of squabbling armies with their petty political differences. Newspaper presses and the few radio stations prepare to record the words of Russia’s leader for era’s to come. Now as Drozdovsky comes out he speaks to the gathered crowds outside the Kremlin. Speaking both in a mechanical yet sincere tone, he states to the entire Russian state and the world, today is the day which Russia will remember as its “unity day”, for never again will Russia be divided."
rusdroz.48.a: "But can it truly be called unity?"

rusdroz.49.t: "Cultural Awakening"
rusdroz.49.d: "Directed by aspiring film-maker Sergei Einsentein, 'Alexander Nevsky' has made its first appearance in theatres across Russia's cities. The film is a historical drama depicting the invasion of Novgorod in the 13th century by the dastardly Teutonic Knights, who are defeated and chased out of the nation by the heroic Alexander Nevsky, Prince of Novgorod and an important figure in Russian history. The film has received wide-spread acclaim across Russia for many reasons - its cinematography and special effects is unlike any movie out there, especially with its grand and monumental climax depicting the Battle of the Ice. Many have also commended Eisenstein for his choice to use sound for the first time with the film, as its musical score composed by Sergei Prokofiev is met with admiration and praise. The film itself surprisingly had almost never seen the light of day, due to Einsentein's Jewish ancestry. However, having been baptised, the government green-lighted its production almost reluctantly.\n\nMany film-critics were keen to note the obvious allegory present in the film, as Eisenstein himself had pointed out in an article, between the Teutonic Knights and the German Empire, as well as Novgorod with our Mother Russia. Another theme that was present within the film was the strong sense of traditionalism, with the film acting almost as an outcry to all Russians to embrace their rich culture and history. Arguably, in part due to the massive success of the film, these messages has emboldened the general population, and high morale has been reported amongst our soldiers."

rusdroz.50.t: "Religious Art Exhibition"
rusdroz.50.d: "With a government that finally is treating the faith of the Russian people with the respect that it deserves, an almost enumerable amount of programs dedicated to revitalizing that faith have sprung up. One such program is the [RUS.GetCapital] National Exhibition of Religious Art. Displaying such works as Andrei Rublev's famous Hospitality of Abraham, and several glorious depictions of Christ Pantocrator. While all in all a small and modest affair, this state sponsored showing of Holy Russia's most glorious icons seems to have already triggered the desired effect; In the days since the Exhibition's opening, more and more churches are beginning to be packed to the brim, bringing the salvation of the Russian people just a little closer."

rusdroz.51.d: "Countess Nina Podgorichani-Petrovich has long enjoyed the spotlight and adoration of the Russian public for her enticing and tantalizing poems and translations of foreign folktales and novels. A darling of the Russian socialite scene, Countess Nina has long caught the eye of the masses with both her literary skill and her witty charm, and in her long career the Countess has earned many honors and drawn the attention of the masses many times. However, it seems this now matured aristocrat is not done drawing our attention quite yet! \n\nIn a tense and grueling tournament for the national chess championships currently being held in Irkutsk, Nina has been pitted against greats odds once more as she faces some of the best strategists and tacticians in the Empire. After hours of fierce competition against the likes of other chess masters such as Peter Romanovsky, Nikolai Riumin, Viktor Goglidze, and many more,  this charismatic starlet has trounced them all, emerging from the tournament as the highest national chess champion in all of Russia. This historic victory marks the first time a woman had ever won such an event, truly showing the keen mind the Countess has become famous for. With another new laurel to rest on, the people of Russia cheer as their Countess continues to show what a Russian woman truly can be!"

rusdroz.52.t: "Tsar Nicholas II to Be Canonized"
rusdroz.52.d: "This morning, after a meeting with a majority of Russian bishops, Patriarch Krill announced to an elated crowd outside of Saint Basil's Cathedral that the late Nicholas II and his family are to be canonized in the near future.  The Tsar and his family are to be deemed Martyrs, shedding their blood for the sole fact that they were Christian. To many, both within and without Russia, this comes as no shock. It is no secret that the government of [RUS.GetLeader] has been investing and pushing strongly for the late Tsar's canonization almost since he took power. Regardless, the people of Russia can sleep a little more soundly, know that Nicholas II and his family are praying for us in the Heavenly Kingdom above. "
rusdroz.52.a: "A Martyrdom recognized at last."

rusdroz.53.t: "Canonization of the Imperial Family"
rusdroz.53.d: "Following a beautifully conducted ceremony including Patriarch Krill, [RUS.GetLeader] and several minor Bishops, Tsar Nicholas II and his family have been officially canonized. In a short speech, Patriarch Krill espoused the virtues of the Imperial Family, as he retold a dramatic retelling of their martyrdom. He told of the struggle of their short few weeks of house assert, their patience in the face of abuse, and their resilience in the face of death.\n\nShortly after the canonization ceremony, [RUS.GetLeader] officially announced a new national holiday, On the [GetDate] of ever year, the Russian shall take the day off to attend Divine Liturgy, and to pay respect to the late Tsar, and remember the evils of Socialism. While some have complained about such a holiday, calling it an abomination of State and Church relations in the modern age. Such naysayers have quickly be silenced, due to both the overwhelming majority of people supporting his canonization, and the ever listening ears of the Turkul Bureau."

rusdroz.54.d: "Bookstores and libraries across the Empire are seeing near-record breaking turnouts as Yuriy Galich's newest novel hits shelves today. Galich’s newest work is a collection of memoirs, notes, letters, and more from the brave and heroic souls of the Dobrovolcheskaya Armiya, the Volunteer Army of South Russia that valiantly fought back the Red hordes that threatened the lands of Ukraine and the Caucasus. Led by great heroes of the Civil War, such as Lavr Kornilov, Pyotr Wrangel, Anton Deninkin, and of course, our own honored Mikhail Drozdovsky, these true sons of Russia fought valiantly at Kiev, Peregonovka, Tsaritsyn, and beyond, slaughtering the Bolshevik menace wherever it sprouted from. Galich has put the realities of these brave men’s sacrifices and heroics to the page in an organized collection so that all of Russia may read of these great deeds and of the great deeds of our Marshall Mikhail Drozdovsky, for without the valiant acts and deaths of these men, all of Russia as we know it would not exist today. To these heroes of the Civil War, and to Galich for bringing the lost words of these true Russian sons home!"

rusdroz.56.t: "Rumors of a Monarchist Plot in the Military"
rusdroz.56.d: "Following Kornilov's coup of the dedadent a weak Republican government, Russia once more finds herself under the hand of the armed forces. While Kornilov and his supporters expected for some kind of blow black from the population, we hardly expected something from within our own ranks. Based on limited intelligence gathered by Kornilov loyalists within monarchists circles, it appears that Black-Hundredists officers, centered around Mikhail Drozdovsky, are plotting to overthrow our government while it's still in it's infancy. While we have little more then hearsay to back up these claims, many with access to this intelligence, chief among them being Denikin, are calling on Kornilov to purge these officers, to secure our position. While it would weaken our officer pool, with enough men on their side, these monarchists could pose a real threat too our state. The choice, however, is Kornilov's alone to make."
rusdroz.56.a: "Hearsay is not justification to remove talented officers."
rusdroz.56.b: "Purge them, better safe than sorry."

rusdroz.57.t: "Drozdovsky's Regiment Makes its Move!"
rusdroz.57.d: "General Kornilov soon realized his folly. Rashly acting on the rumors of a restorationist plot, word broke out and the would be conspirators sprung into action, their intentions made manifest by necessity. Led by Mikhail Drozdovsky, the group of his veterans, Black-Hundredists and other White officers sympathetic to the royal cause moved to secure government buildings and armories all around the capital. While Kornilovite forces tried to stop them at first, they were quickly overwhelmed in what became an absolute bloodbath on the streets and inside various houses loyalist regiments hid in.\nThe whole situation lasted for roughly eight hours, after which republican generals and senior officers were either arrested or shot while ordinary soldiers were ordered to swear fealty to their new supreme commander. With the battle for soul of Russia itself won by Drozdovsky, he can finally rouse the sleeping masses to save Holy Rus and make their noble ancestors proud."
rusdroz.57.a: "March, the people of Russia, for your salvation!"

rusdroz.60.t: "The Great Zemsky Sobor of [GetYear]"
rusdroz.60.d: "Just as in 1598 when Russia faced a secession crisis following the death of Vasili IV, the greatest minds from the Nobility, Clergy and Commoners have once more gathered together to elect a new Tsar for the Empire. As Marshal Drozdovsky has clearly explained to the men gathered, very few truly have a claim to the throne of Tsar Nicholas. Grand Duke Kirill, while the most 'accepted' claimant, is little more then a snake, who would poison Holy Russia if he were to assent to the Throne, due to his traitorous acceptance of the February Revolution. Grand Duke Dmitri, while making no claim to the Throne, has likewise dishonored himself, due to his participation in the murder of Rasputin.\n\nWith this in mind, Marshal Drozdovsky has presented before the Zemsky Sobor two candidates, both from the House of Romanov, but both lacking claims to the Imperial Throne. These two men are Prince Roman Petrovich and Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich. Both men are set to appear before the Zemsky Sobor, before this most hollowed meeting makes it's decision in regards to the new Tsar."
rusdroz.60.a: "Let us see what Prince Roman has to offer..."

rusdroz.61.t: "Prince Roman Petrovich"
rusdroz.61.d: "Born in the now burning City of peter in 1896, Prince Roman is the son of the deceased Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich - the occultist socialite infamous for his role in bringing Rasputin to the Imperial Court. Long the black sheep of the Russian Imperial Family, this cadet-branch of the Romanovs is perfectly distanced from the corruption and decadence of the former line, and with the black stain that was the Grand Duke now dead, his titles have fallen to Prince Roman. Nothing like his odd father, Roman served in the Weltkrieg as a sapper on the Turkish Front and has proven himself to be a measured and straight-headed man - fitting qualities for a possible Tsar. Additionally, the Prince has already been wed to a woman of high standing, the Countess Praskovia Sheremeteva, and with her has already sired legitimate issue, staving off any possible succession crisis. All in all, the young aristocrat would be a fitting Tsar for our reborn Empire, but that is not up for our regime or Drozdovsky alone to decide, for only the Zemsky Sobor holds that right."
rusdroz.61.a: "...and now for the Zemsky Sobor to decide."

rusdroz.62.t: "Grand Duke Boris"
rusdroz.62.d: "Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich was born in 1877, being a grandson to Alexander II. Being a member of the Romanov dynasty he has always lived a luxurious lifestyle that was relatively carefree from the nuances of the average day russian peasantry. However he often made himself more notable from the average romanov nobles, besides being a grand duke who often was not thought of in the wider family, he also served as a major general in the army. He still did not make much of his career, preferring parties where he could socialize and enjoy himself. This remained his lifestyle throughout the great war and civil war, where he typically kept his head down from wider monarchist affiliation but kept himself a proud russian noble. His attempts however have not been unnoticed by those who pay attention to the romanov bloodline, and now the Grand Duke might just prove to be a worthy candidate for the throne under Drozdovsky."
rusdroz.62.a: "...time to make a choice"

rusdroz.63.t: "The Zemsky Sobor's Decision"
rusdroz.63.d: "Having seen both candidates and having had a few days to process and deliberate, the time has come for the Zemsky Sobor to make a decision. While many predicted had predicted debating, there has been shockingly little debate. The reason for this, it seems, is that most within the assembly are awaiting for Marshal Drozdovsky to make his own choice.\n\nAfter a long period of silence, the Marshal produced from his coat a pen, with which he wrote a single word on a piece of paper, which he handed to  Patriarch Kirill who had been presiding over the Zemsky Sobor. The Patriarch, speaking for the whole assembly, then rose and proclaimed; 'We, the gathered members of the Zemsky Sobor, do hereby proclaim the election of a new Tsar! May God guide his hand, protect his soul and bring him a long love! With one accord, we proclaim...       "
rusdroz.63.a: "...Long Live Tsar Boris II!'"
rusdroz.63.b: "...Long Live Tsar Roman I!'"

rusdroz.64.t: "Gridlock Coalition"
rusdroz.64.d: "With the People's Union being a big-tent coalition of various monarchists that hold different views on who should be crowned Tsar, we're a long far from agreement. It seems it will be another year of Russia being without a Tsar on the throne and in the heads of its people."
rusdroz.64.a: "We all want the same thing, then why can't we agree on anything?"

russia.36589.t: "The Eternal President"
russia.36589.d: "It was a cold day in Petrograd, I was going for a daytime stroll as I existed the Duma building. From the crowd emerged a shadowy figure who, before the police could do anything, discharged a gun. I saw my entire life flash before my eyes, from my birth to my childhood, to the Revolution, all the way until the very second where I was shot. It all went blank, until I woke up in my bed the next day. I assumed it was all a dream, just a bad dream, surely my guards wouldn’t allow my assassination?\n\nBut as I exited the Duma, I saw the same gunman approach, and the same bullet fly towards my head, but as soon as the bullet pierced my skull, and ass soon as my brains splattered all over the Duma’s walls, I awoke in my bed the very next morning. It kept going on like this, on and on, for what felt like an eternity\n\nEvery day as I awoke I saw the world change around me, familiars faces changing, the world becoming a little different every time I awoke. The first day I was trapped in this loop, Italy was divided into two pieces, eventually I came to find that it was divided into five, a few years later it was back to two pieces. I liked it better when it was in 5 pieces. I found out who that hooded gunman was, it was one of Savinkov’s insane lackeys, Pavel Gorgulov. But even as I find out more and more of the world I live in, I could never seem to avoid the tragic events of my death.\n\nMy assassination seemed to be the only constant left in the world, until the one day where I defied my set-in stone fate. As I saw Gorgulov approach, I stood unflinching, I knew the bullet would reset this loop at any second; I had just grown used to that. But as the gun fired, I took a deep breath, and ran like hell towards my eternal assassin. With all my might I tackled Gorguov, even as he feebly tried to shoot me again and again; the bullets simply glanced off of me. With the combined rage I had build up over the countless years stuck in this time loop hell, I thrust my hand into Pavel Gorgulov’s chest, and pulled out his still-beating heart. As I saw his life force fade, I grimaced. I had finally done it, I had broken the loop, I had finally survived.\n\nThat was almost 500 years ago, and I have ruled Russia as their Eternal President ever since. I have seen nations crumble, men die, systems fall, but in all of this, in all of the chaotic uncertainty of the world, I, President Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky remain as the one, true unflinching constant in this dark and dreary world.

rus_karelian_crisis.17.t: "Finland Requests Mediation"
rus_karelian_crisis.17.d: "Amidst the escalating war with Russia, with the echoes of artillery fire resonating across the borderlands, the toll of war has become painfully apparent for the Finnish government, with losses mounting and the reality of protracted conflict looming on the horizon. Recognizing the gravity of the situation, the Finnish leadership has decided to seek mediation from us, as they already did in 1922 during the East Karelian Uprising. Desperate for a respite from the bloodshed and hoping to find a diplomatic solution, Finland dispatches envoys to Berlin, urging the government to intervene and mediate between Russia and Finland."

rus_karelian_crisis.18.d: "A somber realization has set in – Germany has refused Finland's plea for mediation. The envoys, having traveled to Berlin with hopes of a diplomatic intervention, return with a heavy heart, bearing the weight of Germany's rejection. The Finnish government, faced with the stark reality of standing alone in the brewing conflict, grapples with the consequences of Germany's decision. The rejection of mediation leaves Finland to face the Russian juggernaut without the prospect of external intervention. The news of Germany's refusal reverberates through the streets of Helsinki and beyond, casting a shadow of uncertainty over the nation. The Finnish populace, once hopeful for a diplomatic resolution, now confronts the harsh actuality of a protracted and potentially devastating war."

Tampere, the chosen venue, becomes the focal point for high-stakes negotiations. The Finnish people, weary of the impending conflict, cautiously embrace a glimmer of hope for a peaceful resolution. As Russian diplomats prepare to sit across the table, there is a palpable sense of anticipation and apprehension. The fate of Karelia hangs in the balance, and the outcome of these talks will shape the future of the region."

rus_karelian_crisis.20.t: "German Mediation of the Conflict"
rus_karelian_crisis.20.d: "Faced with the intensifying conflict with Finland, Germany has stepped forward, proposing a diplomatic solution to ease tensions. A diplomatic envoy arrives in [ROOT.Capital.GetName], extending an invitation to engage in mediated talks in Tampere, Finland. The Germans advocate for a peaceful resolution that could spare both nations from the ravages of war.\n\nOur government is now presented with a critical decision: accept the German-mediated proposal and engage in diplomatic negotiations, or reject the offer, opting to pursue the military option to resolve the Karelian question. Recollecting the previous Treaty of Tartu, that eventually led to the current war, perhaps, the German mediation is not the best solution for Russian interests?"

The Kaiser's envoy, laden with hopes for de-escalation, returns to Berlin with somber news. Russia's refusal raises concerns about the potential ramifications of a failed diplomatic intervention.

The failure of German diplomacy casts a dark shadow over hopes for a peaceful resolution. Finland now confronts the stark reality that the diplomatic avenue, once promising, has closed. The rejection raises the stakes, pushing the nation closer to the brink of all-out war for control over Karelia. The Finnish people brace themselves for the impending storm, knowing that the path to conflict has become all but inevitable."

For Finland, this represents an opportunity to resolve the Karelian question without further bloodshed. The Finnish people, weary of the looming conflict, cautiously embrace the prospect of a diplomatic solution. Tampere, the city of negotiations, is now the stage where the fate of Karelia will be discussed, and the outcome of these talks holds the key to a lasting peace or renewed hostilities."
rus_karelian_crisis.24.d.rus: "Representatives from Russia and Finland have gathered in Finnish city of Sortavala (Serdobol) to sign a ceasefire agreement. This marks the initiation of formal peace talks, and the delegates will soon head to Tampere for negotiations. Our government, having agreed to the German-mediated process, expresses a commitment to exploring diplomatic avenues for resolving the Karelian crisis. The ceasefire offers a temporary reprieve from hostilities, and both nations cautiously hope that reason will prevail over the specter of war."

rus_karelian_crisis.25.t: "Tampere Peace Talks: Our Strategy"
rus_karelian_crisis.25.d: "With the peace talks about to start, the Russian delegation faces a critical decision on their approach to the peace talks. Three distinct viewpoints emerge among the delegates, each carrying its own implications for the outcome of the negotiations. Some members advocate for a cautious strategy, understanding the delicate balance between appeasing Germany and managing Finnish expectations. The emphasis is on avoiding excessive demands that might provoke international intervention while securing concessions that align with Russia's interests.\n\nA middle ground is proposed, advocating for a balanced strategy that seeks compromises from both sides. The delegation believes that a fair agreement, which acknowledges the concerns of both Russia and Finland, would be more likely to garner international support and foster long-term stability in the region.\n\nThere are those within the delegation who argue for a firm stance, demanding significant territorial and political concessions from Finland. This approach prioritizes Russia's security and seeks to assert dominance over Finland, even at the risk of further straining international relations. It is seen as a way to ensure a favorable outcome for Russia, regardless of external opinions. As the delegates deliberate on these divergent strategies, the choice made in Tampere will profoundly influence the direction of the peace talks and the future relationship between Russia and Finland."
rus_karelian_crisis.25.d.ger: "In the role of mediator, the German delegation faces a crucial decision on how to navigate the delicate dance between Russian demands and Finnish aspirations at the Tampere Peace Talks. Two distinct strategies emerge, each carrying its own set of consequences and implications for German-Russian relations.\n\nSome German diplomats advocate for a cautious mediation strategy. This approach seeks to prevent further escalation with Russia by avoiding actions that might be perceived as too favorable to Finland. The emphasis is on maintaining a delicate balance, ensuring that German efforts do not alienate the Russian delegation while still fostering a fair resolution that respects the concerns of both parties.\n\nOthers within the German delegation argue for a more balanced mediation approach. This strategy aims to address Russian concerns by facilitating concessions from Finland, but also ensuring that the Finns do not feel overly coerced. The goal is to reach a compromise that pacifies Russian interests to some extent while also maintaining the stability of German-Finnish relations. As the German delegation contemplates these divergent strategies, the choice made in Tampere will significantly shape the outcome of the peace talks and influence the broader diplomatic landscape in Northern Europe. The delicate act of balancing Russian sensitivities and Finnish expectations falls squarely on the shoulders of the German mediators."

rus_karelian_crisis.26.d: "$rus_karelian_crisis.26.d.intro$ In a cautious move, Russia reclaims the territories of Repola and Porajärvi (Reboly and Porosozero), originally ceded to Finland after the East Karelian Uprising of 1922 and the Treaty of Tartu. Finland is compelled to cease all support for Karelian separatists. In an effort to maintain stability, Russia establishes the Autonomous Republic of Karelia in White Karelia, centered around the city of Ukhta.

In exchange, Russia secures a northern border strip, including the Finnish region of Raivola. Finland commits to ending support for Karelian separatists, and Russia establishes the Autonomous Republic of Karelia in White Karelia, with Ukhta as its capital.

Finland's support for Karelian separatists ceases, and Russia establishes the Autonomous Republic of Karelia in White Karelia.

rusfor.499.t: "The Disobedient Steppe" 
rusfor.499.d: "For many years, the entirety of the Kirgiz steppe constituted a part of Russia. The tumultuous aftermath of the Civil War resulted in the establishment of autonomy for locals roaming the steppes within the framework of post-revolutionary Russia. Subsequently, they attained even greater independence, albeit their government could never fully achieve true sovereignty.\n\nNow, as the entire steppe once again falls under our control, we face uprisings, acts of subversion, and sabotage. The Kirgiz people have taken refuge in the steppes, disrupting peaceful life.\n\nThe government is faced with a critical decision: how to address these rebellious territories in order to foster integration and quell chaos and rebelliousness."
rusfor.499.a: "Restore the Steppe General-Governorate."
rusfor.499.b: "Rely on the Cossack to pacify the [GetKazakhEtnonym]s."
rusfor.499.c: "They shall have their autonomy, but under our strict control."
rusfor.499.e: "Kazakhs deserve their own autonomous Soviet republic."

rusfor.500.t: "The Basmachi Resistance"
rusfor.500.d: "Insurgencies and acts of subversion are rampant throughout the territories of Turkestan, a region renowned for its abundance of cotton, gold, and other valuable resources. The influence of the local Kurbashis, commonly known as Basmachis, meaning \"bandits\" in their native Turkic tongue, remains potent. It is up to our government to determine how best to ensure the full reintegration of this region into the fold of our Motherland."
rusfor.500.a: "Put things in order with a firm hand."
rusfor.500.b: "Rely on the Cossacks to pacify the Basmachi."
rusfor.500.c: "The idea of autonomies was good, but the implementation suffered."
rusfor.500.e: "The Soviet republics will solve the problem."

rusfor.501.t: "The Pan-Turkist Threat"
rusfor.501.d: "The process of Turkestan's integration continues, yet several of our advisors have come to the realization that the widespread nature of these uprisings can be attributed to the shared belief among local populations that they constitute a unified Turkic nation. Consequently, the notion emerged that combating Pan-Turkism as an ideology advocating for the separation of Turkic peoples from Russia could potentially resolve the issue. In essence, it is imperative to dismantle Turkestan and eradicate any sense of unity among these ethnic groups, fostering a heightened sense of national identity within them. Of course, only within the framework of Russia can these nations maintain their existence and thrive."
rusfor.501.a: "We will be content with Turkestan autonomy."
rusfor.501.b: "Time to end this nonsense, there is work for ethnographers."
rusfor.501.c: "Divide the region according to the economic principle."

rusfor.502.t: "Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Turkestan"
rusfor.502.d: "Muslims of Turkestan have always been viewed as more conservative and, in all honesty, luddite and backward compared to more culturally Russified regions like Dagestan, Tatarstan and Bashkiria. Many have identified this obscurantism as one reason why Turkestan has been stubbornly refusing to integrate into modern Russia and to the modern world at large.\n\nAs part of the overhaul of Central Asian security services and bureaucracy, we have also launched religious reforms in cooperation with the Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly. Its Tatar and Bashkir priests are loyal to the government and have drafted plans for reforming the Turkestani religious institutions into a more modern form, closer to those of developed Muslim countries like [TUR.GetName]."
rusfor.502.a: "Yes, it is a good initiative."
rusfor.502.b: "We should strive for secularism instead."
rusfor.502.c: "What, we should undermine Islam as much as possible!"

rusfor.504.t: "Problems in Turkestan"
rusfor.504.d: "Though we have established a new Spiritual Administration of the Muslims of Turkestan, but it is still controlled mainly by the same priests, who had been playing a significant role in Turkestan since the Civil war till the annexation. Of course we will have to change the situation here, but it will take us a lot of time."
rusfor.504.a: "Oh well..."

rusfor.505.t: "Pacification of Turkestan"
rusfor.505.d: "Good news from Turkestan - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
rusfor.505.a: "That's great!"

rusfor.508.t: "Deciphering the 1897 Census"
rusfor.508.d: "In the census conducted by the Tsarist government in 1897, a substantial portion of the settled urban population in Turkestan, specifically in the cities such as Samarkand, Tashkent and Skobelev, was designated by the ethnonym \"Sarty\". However, many scholars and orientalists maintain that this is not a genuine ethnic designation, but rather a class label that refers to the urban bourgeoisie and merchant class. There exist more speculative theories that suggest the Sarts may be a people of Aryan descent, distinct from the neighboring Uzbeks and Tajiks. For many years, local intellectuals in Turkestan have been advocating against the use of the term \"Sart\", viewing it as a remnant of Tsarist oppression."
rusfor.508.a: "Discard this Tsarist label!"
rusfor.508.b: "It is most correct to call both peoples Turkestanis."
rusfor.508.c: "The Sarts are a special people of Aryan origin."

rusfor.514.t: "The Iron Veins of Turkestan"
rusfor.514.d: "The railways, which until 1936 were under our auspices and reliable supervision, are of paramount significance in the peaceful amalgamation of Turkestan. The oversight of these railways guaranteed tranquility and order across Turkestan. While many of our advisors advocate the restoration of control over the railways and cargo transportation, there may be a more advantageous course of action."
rusfor.514.a: "The control will be given to the workers of the railway workshops!" #socialist/SR
rusfor.514.b: "Auction them off." #liberal/conservative
rusfor.514.c: "Only state control - they are of great importance." #all other

RUS_create_uzbekistan: "Unite the Uzbeks"
RUS_create_uzbekistan_desc: "For centuries, Turkestan was divided among various khanates — Kokand, Bukhara, and Khiva — which until recently remained separate. Some scholars argue that these distinct feudal entities serve as a means of distinguishing their respective populations, while others maintain that all these states were essentially Uzbek, populated predominantly by Uzbeks. This suggests that it would be advantageous to merge them into a single category, including in administrative terms, ultimately bringing an end to this archaic division."
RUS_create_tajik_republic: "Create the Tajik Republic"
RUS_create_tajik_republic_desc: "The metropolises of Turkestan serve as melting pots for diverse ethnic groups, including Turkic tribes, Bukharan Jews, Russians, and Germans. However, none of these populations can claim both a greater degree of influence and a more oppressed status than the Tajiks — the Persian-speaking Muslim community that has long endured the oppression of Bukharan Emirs. It is possible to establish a Tajik autonomous region in Eastern Bukhara; however, the majority of Tajiks residing in urban areas will likely continue to live outside this autonomous territory."

However, there is a distinct sub-group of the mountain Kirgiz who reside in the vicinity of Przhevalsk and Pishkek, known as the Kara-Kirgiz or Black Kirgiz, who differ from their steppe counterparts. However, their geographical and cultural proximity to the steppe Kirghiz (or Kazakhs as they refer to themselves), makes us think they should be united under a single administration."
RUS_create_kyrgyzia: "Establish Mountainous Kirgizstan"
RUS_create_kyrgyzia_desc: "The Kirgiz people, a vast ethnic group, traditionally inhabited both the vast steppes and the majestic Tyan-Shan mountains. However, there is a distinct sub-group of the mountain Kirgiz who reside in the vicinity of Przhevalsk and Pishkek, known as the Kara-Kirgiz or Black Kirgiz, who differ from their steppe counterparts. Despite their geographical and cultural proximity to the steppe Kirghiz (or Kazakhs as they refer to themselves), it is worth exploring the unique characteristics of these mountain dwellers and recognizing their distinct identity."

RUS_create_karakalpakstan_desc: "Ethnographers have devoted particular attention to the area near the Aral Sea inhabited by the Karakalpaks, who are descendants of the Pechenegs. Their name is derived from their distinctive black hats. A number of scholars maintain that the Karakalpaks have maintained close ties with Uzbek khanates over the centuries, while speaking a language close to [GetKazakhEtnonym] one."

A number of scholars maintain that the Karakalpaks share a close affinity with the [GetKazakhEtnonym]s in the north, sharing a similar dialect and should be united with them."
RUS_create_turkmen_autonomy: "Create the Turkmen Autonomy"
RUS_create_turkmen_autonomy_desc: "The territory of the Transcaspian region, centred in the city of Askhabad and inhabited by diverse Turkmen tribes, holds particular significance for us. These tribes are perhaps among the most militant peoples, having actively engaged in what they call \"gazavat against Russian colonialism\" for nearly half a century. Junaid Khan, the leader of one such Turkmen tribe, was arguably the most formidable and perilous adversary of Russia in Central Asia during his reign. As he governed his domain with an iron fist, he also pursued a goal of unifying all Turkmen tribes under a single tribal-state. We must impose unity and autonomy upon these tribes through force."

We could replicate the status quo prior to 1936 — establishing direct oversight over New Tashkent, a district predominantly inhabited by Russians and railway workers, while designating Old Tashkent for the Muslim population, irrespective of their ethnic background."

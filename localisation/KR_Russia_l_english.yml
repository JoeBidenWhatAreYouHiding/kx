### Leaders ###
POLITICS_BORIS_SAVINKOV_DESC:0 "A terrorist, a violent madman, a murderer, a revolutionary and a dictator is just a few of many labels given to Boris Savinkov, the leader of the National Republican Party of Russia. Throughout his colorful life, he has assassinated and bombed many as a part of the Combat Organization of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, before moving on to becoming a pragmatic schemer behind Aleksandr Kerenskiy's back - as Assistant War Minister in 1917, he nearly assumed dictatorial power in Russia from the shadows, and only the collapse of the Kornilov coup led to his downfall. However, he rehabilitated himself by organizing the Union for the Defense of the Motherland, an underground resistance organization in Moscow which prepared the soil for the city's fall in 1919.\n\nSavinkov may have once been a socialist, but he has long since abandoned the weak Socialist Revolutionaries in favor of a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced him over the years - all of which merge into a system of totalitarian dictatorial rule, extreme Russian nationalism, and a concept of palingenetic rebirth: like an eagle rising from the ashes, the Vozhd shall restore the glory of the Russian state and transform it into a hegemon of reaction. Owing to his history of being a terrorist, constantly hiding from the authorities and anyone who might hand him over to the Okhrana, Savinkov is almost psychotically paranoid. He still sees enemies at every corner and constantly keeps his party on edge. Above anyone else, however, he despises socialism, in all of its forms."
POLITICS_DMITRI_ROMANOV_DESC:0 "Grand Duke Dmitriy Pavlovich is a first cousin of the last Emperor of all Russians, Nikolay II, and one of the most famous members of the House of Romanov. Since his childhood, he has been seen as the forefront of a new generation of royals, unlike, say, the aging Grand Duke Kirill - he is an avid sportsman and ambitious adventurer integrated into modern Western society. Through his friendship with Prince Feliks Yusupov, he participated in the assassination of Grigory Rasputin and was banished to Persia as a result - thanks to this, however, he survived the Russian Revolution and escaped to Western Europe. After an affair with Coco Chanel and Audrey Emery, Dmitriy returned to Russia, and accepted the new Republican order - at least in the open. \n\nA coalition of monarchists and moderate right wing republicans have assembled behind Dmitriy, seeing a savior in his persona. Those afraid of Kirill's character believe that the "Modern Romanov" would make for a great constitutional monarch, whereas aristocratic republicans see a strong and charismatic persona which could unite the left and the right. Dmitriy has never seen himself as a ruler, nor is he all that competent at governance, but should he be thrusted into power, he certainly would not object - if he can extract amusement out of lording over Russia."

POLITICS_PAVEL_II_DESC:0 "Only 12 at the moment of his father's death, young Pavel II is very likely to become a puppet at the hands of the regency council. Still, it is obvious that he inherited at least some of his father's charm - which, if combined with a sufficient political capacity, may someday give him a chance for independent rule."
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, now Kirill I of Russia, is one of the most troublesome members of the House of Romanov. Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays some lip service to greater democratic ideals, it truly doesn't matter to him whether Russia is constitutional or authoritarian - as long as he is the one in charge."

POLITICS_VLADIMIR_ROMANOV_CON_DESC:0 "Vladimir III Romanov is the second Tsar of the restored Russian Empire, taking the throne from his father Kirill in 1938, at a mere 21 years of age. He is a different man from his father and many other members of his dynasty - a young man who has never even seen Nikolay II or the former Russian Empire, and thus only knows it from stories and history books. Educated in Canada and having received a course in military affairs in Russia, Vladimir gives off the aura of an erudite and an intellectual. He speaks several languages - English, French, Spanish and German - besides his native Russian, he shows competence in diplomatic affairs and domestic issues alike. Assuming the throne at such a young age has had a toll on him and the first few years of his reign were bound to be awkward, but the Russian aristocracy and populace have great hopes in the young Tsar. Perhaps he can prevent a yet another Revolution."

POLITICS_PYOTR_WRANGEL_TSAR_DESC:0 "Among Russian generals of Baltic German birth, of which there are many, Pyetr IV Vrangel is perhaps the most famous. A talented cavalry officer from a family which gifted several commanders to the Imperial Russian Army, Vrangel distinguished himself during the Brusilov Offensive, where he showed himself as an aggressive yet trustworthy commander. For a brief time, after the October Revolution, he worked with Pavlo Skoropadsky's Ukrainian State and still remembers the Hetman fondly, but resigned from his post to not serve the German occupation and volunteered for the Volunteer Army instead. It is here where the legend of the so-called "Black Baron" began - the air of nobility and respectable loyalty around his persona built up gravitas among his men and his enemies, who started singing songs about the evil baron restoring the Tsar's throne. \n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Vrangel remained in the army and rapidly climbed up in command thanks to the talent he showed during the war. Though generally apolitical, he vividly remembers the Russian Civil War and is willing to do anything it takes to prevent such a travesty from befalling Russia again - even if it means taking control of the nation and directing it with an iron fist. And no matter what he might do, his officers will follow him regardless - to this day, junior officers in the Army ask themselves "If Tsar Pyotr was here, what would he do?""
POLITICS_ANTON_DENIKIN_DESC:0 "Born to a Russian father and Polish mother, Anton Denikin chose to embrace the patriotism of the former, and tied the rest of his life with the Imperial Russian Army. By the Great War, he was a major general and a chief of staff in Kiev Military District, and a prolific writer who analysed the shortcomings of the Russian army. A second in command to Lavr Kornilov, he escaped to Southern Russia alongside him and helped form the Volunteer Army which would ultimately put an end to the Bolshevik revolution. It was Denikin who commanded the units which seized Moscow, and thus gained great adoration among his peers.\n\nAfter the Russian Civil War, Denikin returned to military matters, creating plans for army reforms and pushing forth a proposal to transform the Russian army into a "people's army" via mass mobilization and modernization of recruitment. Politics are the last thing on his mind, but should he end up in power one way or another, Denikin's experience in the Russian chief of staff will lead to him commanding the nation like he used to command his regiment."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "To talk about modern Russian politics is to talk about the life of Aleksandr Kerenskiy, the Republic's founding father to some and a symbol of its decay to others. A noted lawyer and legal professor, Kerenskiy sympathized with the radical socialist movement in his youth and served as legal counsel to several revolutionaries imprisoned after the Revolution of 1905, he was even a childhood friend of Vladimir Lenin. Eventually, however, he accepted that socialism can only be achieved through reform, and by the time the Great War began, he was a leading member of the socialist opposition in the State Duma. This propelled him to lead the republican Provisional Government after the February Revolution - briefly, before he was overthrown by the Bolsheviks. Kerenskiy returned to power in 1921, as the first President of the Russian Republic, a man changed by years of exile and the damage which the Russian Civil War dealt to the country.\n\nIn 1936, Kerenskiy marks his fifteenth year as President, a feat achieved thanks to a lack of competent opposition, plenty of political manipulation, fearmongering over the everpresent Kolchak putschist threat, and often just downright luck. In all these years in power, Kerenskiy established land reform, helped rejuvenate the Russian economy with the New Economic Policy program, and recognized his country's territorial losses in the west. Recent political crises, corruption scandals, and growing opposition to his rule have turned his rule shaky, however. As time went, Kerenskiy has turned more and more towards the right, his socialist credentials now practically non-existent and his bitterness growing, which is eroding the last of his allies in the SR-Kadet coalition. The President remains certain, however - his rule will end either by constitutional decree or by a bullet."
POLITICS_IRAKLIY_TSERETELI_DESC:0 "A noble from the famous Tsereteli lineage, Irakliy Tsereteli turned towards socialism during his childhood, when he came to recognize the vast difference between his wealthy family and the impoverished citizens of Kutaisi, and swore to fix this imbalance. As a law student in Moscow, Tsereteli became embroiled in student protests, was imprisoned, and willingly chose to be deported to Siberia instead of returning to his home. There, he became acquainted with Marxism and joined the RSDLP, although he came to conflict with Lenin and joined the Menshevik faction instead. In 1906, he was elected to the Duma despite being only twenty five years old, and became one of the most prominent leaders of the Menshevik faction. He was once again arrested and deported after the Stolypin coup, but by then, his status as the champion of social democracy was solidified.\n\nIn exile, Tsereteli developed the idea of Siberian Zimmerwaldism - internationalist social democracy - and he returned to Petrograd after the February Revolution. He took a leading role in the Menshevik party, the Petrograd Soviet and Provisional Government, but broke with the Soviets after the Bolshevik takeover and fled to Georgia. Though he worked in the Menshevik government of Noe Zhordania for some time, he became disillusioned with its growing nationalism, which clashed with his internationalism, and thus Tsereteli returned to Russia after the Civil War. The Mensheviks, with the destruction of their former Bolshevik allies, took the RSDLP mantle solely for themselves, and thanks to Tsereteli's leadership, they have managed to return to prominence from the clutches of death. For the longest time, he has served as Leader of the Opposition. In Russian politics, Tsereteli represents innocence and optimism which has long since been lost - he refuses to partake in dirty politics, violence, and concerns himself with eradicating inequality above anything else."
POLITICS_VIKTOR_CHERNOV_DESC:0 "Viktor Chernov was born to the old Russian nobility in Saratov and turned towards revolutionary politics after getting acquainted with the works of the Russian Populist movement in his gymnasium. Studying in Tartu and later in Moscow, Chernov was inducted into a circle of revolutionary friends which included Vladimir Lenin, Vasiliy Maklakov, Pavel Milyukov and numerous others who later ended up moulding Russian history. He vehemently rejected Marxism and its hostility towards the peasantry, and saw a potent revolutionary force in the impoverished, enserfed Russian villages - this ultimately drew him to the Socialist-Revolutionaries. By the turn of the century, he was a prominent member of the Tambov Zemstvo, a leading theorist of agrarian socialism, and a founding member of the PSR. He convinced his party to participate in electoral politics after the Revolution of 1905, until the 1907 Stolypin Coup, which shattered any hopes of a democratic Tsarist regime and convinced Chernov that only revolutionary methods will establish democracy in Russia.\n\nIn 1917, a bitter Chernov returned to Russia, joined the February Revolution and the Petrograd Soviet, only to witness that a decade of exile has shattered the unity of his party. He maintained a centrist position between the Right and Left SRs, but ultimately turned to the Right when the party broke, and became one of the most powerful allies of the Russian Republic. After the restoration of the Republic in 1921, Chernov and Kerenskiy formed a tandem which dominated Russia for the last fifteen years. While Kerenskiy was a gifted speaker and an excellent scapegoat, Chernov worked behind the scenes, forming increasingly unstable and big-tent coalitions to maintain the Socialist-Revolutionaries in power. The left hates him for betraying the October Revolution and the right despises him for being a leftist, but Chernov plays the two sides off to stay in power as long as he possibly can."
POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Milyukov came from the affluent, educated upper urban class and has represented it for his entire life. A veteran of the Russo-Turkish War and a philosophy professor, Milyukov was influenced by the liberal ideas of Herbert Spencer and the Positivist thought of Auguste Comte. To compete in the constitutionally empowered Duma after the Revolution of 1905, he founded the Constitutional Democratic Party (Kadets), which he has run for the next forty years of his life. A party of intellectuals, liberal Zemstvo men, officials and Jews, the Kadets campaigned for a federal, constitutional solution for the Russian nation - if it's republican or democratic, doesn't matter. The Weltkrieg saw Milyukov heavily lurge to the right - he became a nationalist and a supporter of territorial expansion into the Balkans, which gave him the nickname "Milyukov of the Dardanelles".\n\nMilyukov was arguably one of the reasons for the collapse of the Provisional Government - as Kerenskiy's Minister of Foreign Affairs, he staunchly opposed even the discussion of peace with the Central Powers. Despite this, he and the Kadets were too influential to sideline, and after the Russian Civil War, they became one of the most influential political parties in the country. Milyukov has served in several governments and held the position of Prime Minister numerous times, most notably during the assassination of Aleksandr Kerenskiy. His age is catching up to him, but his mind is still sharp - and though Milyukov may be a constitutional democrat, he is a more vehement Russian imperialist than even the average NRPR-er."
POLITICS_NIKOLAI_TRUBETSKOY_DESC:0 "Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy represents a new generation of Russian nobility, an educated, ideologically driven upper class which is opposed to radicalism from the right and from the left. A notable linguist and researcher into phonology, he spent much of his life working with Roman Jakobson to develop the foundations of modern phonetics and started the Prague School of linguistics research. He returned to Russia in the 1920s, however, in charge of the "Russian Union", a conservative monarchist party which declared itself to be a bridge between the increasingly anti-democratic right and the weakening moderate left.\n\nAlongside Pavel Savitsky, Nikolay Trubetskoy developed the ideology of Eurasianism, one which he and his party ascribe to. Trubetskoy's Eurasianism decrees that Russia is intrinsically tied to the peoples of Asia as well as Europe, and that their geopolitical position and history creates an exceptional role for Russia in world history. Russia should lead the fight against what Trubetskoy perceives as "the Europeanization of the world" - Romano-Germanic culture, which, having developed its set of values and moral beliefs, drilled into its head that they are somehow universal. Russia should be at the forefront of a crusade against this cultural imperialism and create a world where each nation is able to develop independently of others. This ideology places Trubetskoy as a nationalist, Russian exceptionalist, and conservative staunchly opposed to Western ideals."

POLITICS_VASILY_MAKLAKOV_DESC:0 "Born to the Muscovite intellectual upper class, Vasiliy Maklakov was practically destined to become a member of the Constitutional Democrats, the party which represented the interests of his class. His political career started while studying law - as a part of his thesis on ancient Greek democracy, he visited Paris and left impressed by its political system, one which he has sought to replicate in Russia since. He gained prominence as a briliant legal mind and an orator, the high point of his legal career was the defense of Menahem Mendel Beilis, a Russian Jew wrongfully accused of committing ritual murder in 1913. He was one of the founding members of the Kadets and represented the party's conservative wing - he sharply criticized Pavel Milyukov, but never to a point of destroying party unity.\n\nSome claim that Maklakov supplied Feliks Yusupov with the poison to murder Grigoriy Semyenov, but he himself denied it - however, Maklakov was opposed to Rasputin and declared the Tsarist regime a vehicle with no brakes, driven by a mad chaffeur. During the Russian Civil War, he maintained Russia's embassy in France, first in Paris and then in Algiers, and returned to his homeland in 1921 to restore the Kadet party. Though calling himself a liberal, Maklakov is a staunch opponent of socialism in all of its forms, and a believer that Russia's fragile democracy needs to be protected from domestic insurrection or foreign invasion at all costs - as long as the price to pay is not liberty."
POLITICS_TYRKOVA_WILLIAMS_DESC:0 "Ariadna Tyrkova was born to the landowning nobility in Novgorod and studied in Saint-Petersburg, where she became acquainted with the liberal reformist publications of Pyotr Struve and thus shifted towards the liberal cause. She was a founding member of the Constitutional Democratic Party, a notable member of its right wing and a proponent of an alliance with the Octobrists. Her defining political stance, however, was her unassailable fight for the rights of women, which got the Kadets to add women's suffrage to their party platform. The Russian Civil War radicalized her, however. After a brief exile to Britain, she returned to Rostov in 1919, where she declared that liberal democracy has failed Russia and a strong, uniquely Russian government form must take charge instead. \n\nThis got her associated with Eurasianist circles after the Russian Civil War, and ultimately concluded in her becoming a founding member of the Russian Union. Russia's first democratically elected female head of state has a deeply conservative society to resist against, but she is no pushover, and will not shy away to assert Russia's role as the harbringer of Eurasia."

He graduated as an artillery officer and tasted warfare in the Russo-Japanese War, where he gained the nickname of "Leather General" - named as such for his style to wear black leather from head to toes. Already, his tendency for recklessness and unconventional, yet brilliant tactics began to show. After his service in Manchuria, Markov became a teacher in the prestigious Pavlovsk military academy, but duty called him to war once again when the Weltkrieg began. There, he served in the same unit as Anton Denikin, as one of his closest aides, and the two officers developed a mutual feeling of respect. \n\nAfter supporting Lavr Kornilov in his coup attempt, Markov was arrested, but escaped in the chaos after the Bolshevik takeover and escaped to the Don, where he joined the Volunteer Army. There, he distinguished himself as a legend among the White commanders, who would often take matters to his own hands, defeat numerically superior Red forces with the craziest tactics (such as standing on the tracks to stop an armored train, yelling curses at the Bolsheviks as he bombed it with grenades), and saved the White cause from an early defeat. After the end of the Russian Civil War, Markov, a committed republican, remained in the army, and began crafting a new form of warfare based of his experiences of surprise engagements, armored vehicles and maneouvre in the war - though his ideas are radical, the potential behind them is incomprehensible."
POLITICS_LAVR_KORNILOV_DESC:0 "One of the most famous military commanders in modern Russian history, Lavr Kornilov is nevertheless a man of surprising mystery. Even his ancestry is a mystery - however, he is definitely of Siberian Cossack birth, and was raised in the harsh militaristic culture of his people. His military career began before the Weltkrieg and culminated in him being appointed the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian army in 1917 - briefly, before the Kornilov affair. In an event which still stumps researchers, Kornilov marched troops on Petrograd, presumably under Kerenskiy's orders, and yet was removed from his post for this treason and escaped to the Don. There, he volunteered for the White Army and became one of its most talented commanders.\n\nKornilov's conflict with the government flared up after the end of the civil war, but at this point, it was him who had the upper hand, and he remained at his post. To those who believed that he might be a traitor, Kornilov proved himself by valiantly standing against Kolchak's coup attempt and helping save the Republic from destruction. Still, he remains one of the most ambitious, and yet at the same time most disillusioned of the White generals. It is no secret that he has formed an alliance with far right forces in the Russian republic, and once in power, he will not shy away from enabling them."
POLITICS_ALEXANDER_SHLIAPNIKOV_DESC:0 "Born from a family of poor Old Believers, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov worked in various factories in Petrograd since he was thirteen and grew to become an ardent revolutionary. Devoted to trade unionism and the struggle of Russian labor for control of their means of production, he allied himself with several radical leftist parties before finally joining the Bolsheviks, although he always pronounced his goals above any of their ideological designs. Because of this, though he participated in the October Revolution, Shlyapnikov constantly came into conflict with Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and constantly criticized their authoritarian tendencies when the rights of workers should be their primary concern. \n\nAs a less prominent Bolshevik, Shlyapnikov escaped the gallows, but continued his political crusade. Alongside his lover Aleksandra Kollontay, he founded the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, and started drifting towards Syndicalism after seeing the success of the French revolution - the TUSP proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."
POLITICS_KARL_RADEK_DESC:0 "Karl Radek would struggle to count the number of socialist movements he's had a hand in over the years. Born in Austria-Hungary to a Jewish Litvak family, he joined the Social Democracy of Poland and Lithuania and participated in the Revolution of 1905 in Warsaw - only to get expelled a few years later as a part of an anti-semitic and anti-Leninist campaign within the party. Briefly, he worked for the German SPD, before getting expelled as well. He worked for the Bremen Left, attended the Zimmerwald Conference in Zurich, and ultimately left for Petrograd in the same sealed train as Lenin to join the October Revolution. He did not stay in Russia either, however - in late 1918, he crossed borders in secret to join the revolutionary events taking place in Germany, moments before they were crushed by the Kaiser. \n\nThis brief adventure is what saved his life, however - instead of executing him like what the Whites did to all Bolsheviks they could find, Radek was kept in prison by the Germans and was eventually released in the late twenties, at which point he once again moved to Russia, "the weakest link in the capitalist system". An ardent revolutionary and a radical even among radicals, Radek stresses the need for Russia to quickly develop itself through use of extensive state planning, in order to prepare for the coming world revolution."
POLITICS_ALEKSEY_RYKOV_DESC:0 "Born from rural Russian peasantry, Aleksey Rykov was an early member of Social Democratic Labour's Bolshevik faction and a supporter of Vladimir Lenin over his political rivals in the movement. After returning from exile in Siberia in 1917, he joined the October Revolution, although he disagreed with the radical inclinations of the Bolshevik movement, and was put in charge of the fledgling Soviet state's industry. During this period, he organized the policy of War Communism, although he later regretted its most brutish measures and the peasant resentment it sparked.\n\nRykov survived the end of the Russian Civil War and joined Nikolay Bukharin in exile to form the People's Socialist Party - the two men found a lot of common ground in their call for caution while transforming the Russian economy and for moderation among the radical factions of the Central Committee."
POLITICS_ALEXANDRA_KOLLONTAI_DESC:0 "Aleksandra Domontovich, marriage name Kollontay, was born to a liberal cavalry general from whom she inherited an interest in history, analytics and political reform. Her leftist sympathies began when she was sent to Western Europe to distance her from a relationship with a poor fellow student, and she started reading into radical leftist literature during the exile. During this time, she became an ardent supporter of women rights, and trade unionism, these views of hers were further driven towards Syndicalism by her lover, Aleksandr Shlyapnikov. \n\nKollontay was a Menshevik until 1915, when she broke over the issue of the Great War, and joined the Bolsheviks instead. During the botched October Revolution, she was a member of the Central Committee and sought to use her position to put her feminist ideology into practice, but the Russian Civil War put an end to her designs. Alongside Shlyapnikov, she helped found the Trade Unions’ Socialist Party, the movement closest to orthodox French syndicalism on Russian soil - it proclaims the needs of the urban worker, the forefront of the Revolution, and declares trade unions to be the building bloc of socialism, while distrusting the Russian peasantry and rural labourers, whom they see as inherently reactionary."
POLITICS_NIKOLAI_BUKHARIN_DESC:0 "Born in a middle class family in the capital of Russia, Bukharin has been a member of the Russian far left for the last three decades. He was an early member of Social Democratic Labour and its Bolshevik faction, convened the conference which founded its youth movement, the Komsomol, and maintained contact with the rest of the party while in exile in the West. There, his political thought was influenced by the European Left, the Austrian Marxists and non-Marxist scholars such as Aleksandr Bogdanov, and he constantly came into ideological conflict with Vladimir Lenin despite remaining a loyal Bolshevik. \n\nBukharin played a key role in the botched October Revolution and emerged as a member of the Soviet republic's left wing - he vehemently opposed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and believed in the prospect of a world revolution, especially when revolutionary events in France began to break out. After the revolution was suppressed, Bukharin was one of the few who managed to escape the gallows, and organized the underground Bolsheviks in the following years into the People's Socialist Party. Wary of possible bureaucratization and "military-feudal exploitation" of the peasantry, Bukharin endorses a moderate approach of cautious industrialization and an alliance between the proletariat and peasantry."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_KAPPEL_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 28th, 1883\nTsarskoye Selo, St. Petersburg Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\n\nVladimir Kappel hails from a noble family of military officers and thus decided to follow the steps of his father, even though he perished in battle when he was still a child. Though educated as a cavalry officer, he graduated with a report how the cavalry is growing obsolete in the face of motorized forces. He served dutifully in the Weltkrieg and participated in the Brusilov Offensive, but his attitude changed when the February Revolution broke out. An avowed monarchist, Kappel remained silent at first, hoping for a restoration of the Romanov order once the situation stabilizes, but soon began to plot with other future White generals. When the Bolsheviks seized power, he was in Perm, and travelled to Samara in order to join the People's Army of Komuch, a republican socialist force which avowed to restore the Constituent Assembly - a monarchist leading a socialist force was a sight to see. \n\nKappel performed his duties with spectacular results - he showed his skill as a calculating tactician and an expert at winter warfare, which allowed him to rout Bolshevik forces several times larger with little difficulty. Bolshevik newspapers even dubbed him "little Napoleon" - the nickname which stuck, however, was "Soldier-General" - a commander who always stayed by his men and fought side by side with a rifle and grenade. After the end of the Bolshevik uprising, Kappel remained in the army and became one of the most important generals in its infantry corps. He is a proponent of army motorization and officer corps modernization."
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_DROZDOVSKY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 7th, 1881\nKiev, Kiev Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\n\nMikhail Drozdovskiy came from a long lineage of Russian nobles in Eastern Ukraine, many of whom served as officers in the army - and so did he. He graduated at the top of his class from the prestigious Pavlovsk Military School and fought in the Russo-Japanese War as an officer in the Life Guards Regiment, where he remained on the front lines despite injury and received several decorations for heroism. In the years that followed, he tried several prospective careers, including submarines and aircraft, but ultimately decided to stick to ground forces. His real career began after the February Revolution, when he was the first to denounce the authority of the republican government in Moscow and disobeyed orders. Stationed in Romania, he watched the Bolshevik takeover from afar and formed a military unit of his own, the Drozdovites, which marched off to join Mikhail Alekseyev's Volunteer Army in the Don.\n\nDuring the Civil War, he gained the reputation of a talented and strict, if reckless commander, who always made sure to assert that he was fighting for the holy House of Romanov. Though the dynasty was not restored, Drozdovskiy continues to harbor hopes that the throne will be assumed by a righteous monarch of noble blood one day, and until that day comes, he has crafted a complex plan for the reform of the Russian army to bring it to modern standards."
POLITICS_IVAN_ROMANOVSKIY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nApril 28th, 1877\nLuhansk, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\n\nAn artillerist by heritage and by education, Ivan Romanovskiy was a veteran of the Russo-Japanese War and a respected division commander in the Weltkrieg when the 1917 revolutions began. Loyal to Lavr Kornilov, he joined the Volunteer Army in the Don and became a commanding officer in the high command. This is where he gained the nickname of the "Bad Luck General". Though a talented commander, he was blunt, sharp and never minced his words, shooting down ideas he thought unacceptable and berating those who proposed them in the general staff, which meant that he ended up hated by every single officer in the army corps except for Denikin and Kornilov. Republicans suspected him of being a monarchist and monarchists believed him to be a republican, but once the Civil War came to an end and he had to choose, Romanovskiy stood by the Republic. His undiplomatic character means that he's been delayed in promotions, but his talent in warfare cannot be mistaken - he is a capable artillery commander and an expert in firepower concentration."
POLITICS_BORIS_SHAPOSHNIKOV_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\nOctober 2nd, 1882\nZlatoust, Ufa Governorate, Russian Empire\n§YMilitary Career:§L\n\nThe backstory of Boris Shaposhnikov, one of the most talented generals in the Russian general staff, has so far remained mostly a mystery. The tight-lipped, mild-mannered, apolitical general has kept his former sympathies towards the Bolshevik Revolution under wraps - not long after Lenin's death at the hands of Fanny Kaplan, he defected from the Red Army, returning to demobilization once again and rejoining the Russian army in 1923. Shaposhnikov's most famous contribution to the Russian army is the three volume military theory work named 'The Brain of the Army', in which he detailed his view on the future of warfare. \n\nDrawing from his experience of the Weltkrieg, he asserts that wars following it will be even more deadly than before, and require mass mobilization never once imagined, the 'opium of war'. For a country to prevail in modern warfare, they must subordinate military matters to political imperative and a some sort of overarching ideology, which would be able to justify mass mobilization and maintain the morale of the average soldier during years of war. In the Russian general staff, he stands as a supporter of army reform according to his military theory."

Staunchly apolitical, he helped maintain order in Kuban when it appeared that it might break between supporters of a union with Ukraine and a union with Russia. After the Civil War, he returned to the Kuban Host, hoping to serve among his countrymen and keep them loyal to the new regime in Moscow. A few years later, however, Pyetr Krasnov raised the banner of rebellion and Naumenko was one of the few notable Cossack leaders who openly resisted him. In battles across the steppes, however, Naumenko was eventually routed and the remnants of his unit escaped to Tsaritsyn. He has since remained in the Russian army, but continues to hold a grudge towards Krasnov for conquering his homeland, the Kuban Host, and awaits the chance to take revenge."

He followed the family tradition, easily enrolling in the Cadet corps, serving in Cossack regiments and graduating from the Academy of General Staff. He served in the Russian Civil War and the Weltkrieg, achieving the rank of Major General by the time of the Revolution. Like many of his peers, Shatilov followed General Kornilov to the Don region and became a member of the Volunteer Army, where he, most notably, became Pyetr Vrangel's close aide. Their friendship survived the war, and even today, Shatilov is always there when Vrangel needs support.\n\nShatilov himself is considered a capable, if particularly cold commander, distinguished by extreme self-control and a permanent frown on his face. Cavalry and military intelligence are his fields of expertise."

Only when he was drafted to the Russian Army did his superiors begin to take note of his bravery in battle and sent him to accelerated training courses. Stationed in Romania, he was present for the formation of the Drozdovite Regiment and followed Drozdovsky to the Don, where he rose through the ranks of the White Army. In the restored Russian Republic, Turkul was no longer ignored and eventually gained the rank of General.\n\nOne of the youngest generals in the Russian general staff and yet highly talented, Turkul is considered by many to be the vanguard of a new generation of Russian officers. He's taken a liking to attracting attention to himself and helping craft this image as well - though he might be a little vain, he is still a valuable commander."

### Events ###
russia.1.t:0 "A Troubled History"
russia.1.d:0 "The February Revolution put an end to centuries of Tsarist despotism, but its achievements were on the verge of being undone. In October of 1917, the Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, stormed the Winter Palace and seized control of Russia, declaring the world's first revolutionary socialist state, Soviet Russia. A wide front of monarchists, republicans, moderate socialists and foreign interventionists rose up against it. The Bolshevik revolution was stillborn - in September of 1918, Lenin was assassinated by Fanny Kaplan, a disgruntled Left SR, and the Bolshevik cause began to disintegrate. This, combined with German supplies provided to the White Movement throughout the civil war, meant that by 1920, the revolution was successfully suppressed.\n\nIn 1922, the White generals dictated a constitution for the new Russian Republic, which, albeit democratic, was riddled with issues and did not satisfy everyone. Hoping that he would prove to be a weak figurehead, the Whites pushed forward Aleksandr Kerenskiy, the leader of the Provisional Government before the October coup, as the first President of the Russian Republic. Kerenskiy would prove to be capable, however, he survived the 1925 Kolchak Putsch and implemented New Economic Policy to restore economic growth, and has governed the country for the past fifteen years. A lack of serious political opposition and widespread electoral manipulation have certainly helped his longevity as well.\n\nBy 1936, however, President Kerenskiy has eroded the last of his allies in the government, and New Economic Policy is no longer yielding any dividends. Nationalists see him kowtow to Germans, democrats believe that he is turning into a dictator, and socialists simply want the entire system gone. All of them share one belief, however - that Russia still has potential to assert its power in the world..."
russia.1.a:0 "Long live Russia, one and indivisible!"

russia.2.t:0 "The Russian Constitution of 1922"
russia.2.d:0 "Signed in 1922, after the end of the Russian Civil War and five years after the February Revolution, the Constitution of the Russian Republic is a scar of the fractured White movement which saw its adoption. It defines Russia as a federal democratic republic, guarantees universal freedoms and rights to every citizen of the Republic, and is the document by which the country's political institutions have been organized since then.\n\nIn some ways, the Constitution is an updated version of the Tsarist constitution of 1906 - the upper house of the Parliament, the Senate, is the main example of this authoritarian heritage. It is an unelected institution composed of senior statemen and delegates from upper strata, such as aristocrats, university professors and business associations. The lower house, the State Duma, is elected and holds most of the legislative power in the country. The presence of the unelected Senate curbs democratic process in the country, however.\n\nThe President is elected by the Senate, but many of his powers and duties are styled after the position of Tsar in the 1906 Constitution - therefore, he holds significant executive power, and appoints the Council of Ministers with the approval of both legislative houses. The President is the primary actor in executing legislative acts and represents the Republic in foreign affairs. He also has access to the infamous Article 48 of the Constitution, which allows the President to take emergency actions without the approval of the Duma. President Aleksandr Kerenskiy has grown fond of using this power to bypass the increasingly fractured legislature and thus pass decrees and laws.\n\nDrafted under the guidance of the White Generals, the Constitution can only call itself a protector of democracy when its articles are not used against it."
russia.2.a:0 "At least the Constitution guarantees stability!"

russia.2017.t:0 "New Economic Policy"
russia.2017.d:0 "The Russian Civil War left the economy of the Republic in a pitiful position - the conflict had devastated the country and left millions dead, famine was breaking out in the Volga Region and anarchy reigned across much of the country. The government of Aleksandr Kerenskiy had a lot of political capital and used it for a vast series of economic stimulus programs dubbed "New Economic Policy" (Novaya ekonomicheskaya politika)\n\nThe NEP combined financial stabilization with concessions to the progressive movement. A new currency was introduced, the Chervonets Ruble, backed by the gold standard, which put an end to rampant inflation. The de facto land redistribution in the countryside was recognized and additional land reform promulgated in order to restore the efficiency of agriculture. A restored agricultural sector allowed Russia to become an exporter and use the revenue from these exports, combined with considerable American and German investment, to restore industrial zones and rebuild the rail system. By the late 1920s, despite losing access to the Don-Kuban chernozem, Russia was one of the fastest growing economies on the planet with plenty of potential to spare.\n\nThe economic miracle began to slow down by 1933. The Great Depression in America depreciated investment in Russia, agricultural efficiency stopped growing due to lacking mechanization, and the gold standard was shackling finances rather than stabilizing them. By 1936, the state has entered a full on recession. \n\nAlthough some hold out hope that the prosperous German market will salvage Russia, the consensus is that New Economic Policy has run its course and a change in policy is needed. Should Russia recover and its economy once again become vibrant, however, its untapped potential will likely turn it to an industrial giant."
russia.2017.a:0 "We should strengthen the economy."

russia.3.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.3.d:0 "During the Berlin Conference in November 1935, the Germans forced us to repay the remaining part of the Weltkrieg war indemnities (agreed upon in the Brest-Litovsk treaty in 1918) one year earlier than expected, which has put the government in a delicate position. The current budget for 1936 is already stretched to a bare minimum, and if we are to pay the accursed Teutons, the cabinet sees no other alternative than to impose harsh austerity measures. The cuts in government spending will be most harshly felt in the social services sector and in the many homes of invalided war veterans depending on the state's support. Our citizens were already disgruntled and dissatisfied with the incumbent coalition of Kadets and Socialist Revolutionaries united under the even more unpopular presidency of Aleksandr Kerenskiy, and it is feared that these austerity measures will bring still more extreme political groupings unto the political scene."

russia.4.t:0 "Payment of the Brest-Litovsk Reparations"
russia.4.d:0 "With stagnation of our economy and worsening conditions of our citizens during 1935, our government has decided that in order to restart our economy we need additional cash, the only available option to amass sufficient capital to help our economy, was to force the Russian state to prematurely repay the remaining reparations from the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. During the Berlin conference in November 1935 president Aleksandr Kerenskiy together with prime minister Pavel Milyukov were forced to accept the premature payment of Brest-Litovsk reparations. With drastic austerity measures the Russian government was able to prematurely repay the remaining parts of its reparations as they were agreed in the treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
russia.4.a:0 "Excellent!"

russia.5.t:0 "The Assassination of Kerenskiy"
russia.5.d:0 "The sound of gunfire rings across the capital. Aleksandr Kerenskiy, the President of the Russian Republic, was shot and killed by an assassin while he was climbing the steps to the Senate House. His killer was shot dead by the military police before he could make his escape. His motives will forever be unknown. Regardless, the fate of Russia has been irrevocably changed."
russia.5.a:0 "A shot that will ring across the world."

russia.6.t:0 "The Aftermath of the Assassination of Kerenskiy"
russia.6.d:0 "Kerenskiy may have been hated by many, but it is only when he died did it become clear how much Russia needed him. The coalition between Kadets and Socialist Revolutionaties has begun to dissolve immediately. Kerenskiy's right hand man, Viktor Chernov, who had usually handled the nitty gritty of coalition building while the President acted as the public face of the party, has suddenly found his job to be a lot harder. All while the right wing forces in the Senate and the Duma coalesce and gather their forces - their soon-to-be savior is Grand Duke Dmitriy, who has all the material to be a fine President in their eyes. Chernov's only hope is that the Left opposition, the Mensheviks and radical socialists represented by Irakliy Tsereteli and Aleksandr Shliapnikov, will put rivalries aside and join forces with the hated SRs and Kadets.\n\nAnti-democratic forces plot in the shadows, too. Pyetr Vrangel, the Black Baron, and Field Marshal Lavr Kornilov have independently drawn their plans on seizing control of the state for this exact occasion. They have no reason to play ball with the parliamentarians in Moscow now that Kerenskiy is gone, after all...\n\nWhatever may be the outcome of the January Crisis, it is bound to leave a lasting impact upon Russian history."

Already, the aristocracy and the business lobby have reached out to him to advise him on his next move - and since Dmitriy has little to no political experience, he is willing to listen. Several candidates are on the table and each one brings their own supporters..."

russia.8.t:0 "Appointing an Acting President"
russia.8.d:0 "At the last moment, thanks to Chernov's efforts, an agreement was found between all the forces to the left of the Kadets - the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Mensheviks, Socialists, Syndicalists and numerous others all joined into a plural left coalition for the defense of the Constitution. Though plenty of work needs to be done from here on out, it can safely be said that the hardest step has been passed.\n\nThe Left coalition has shown itself to be unwilling to bypass constitutional term limits and elect a President for a full term, therefore, only an Acting President will be appointed until the election of 1937. Several candidates have been proposed already, delegated by parties left and right. It is a time of chaos and uncertainty, however, so even factions which used to be weak could strongarm allies and crawl over heads to get the top spot..."

He and his junta are faced with a dilemma, however - to ensure a smooth transition of power, he needs to form a collaborationist civilian government which will help him manage the day to day affairs of the state. Though the list of possible stooges is long, only a few of them bring the necessary skills and bases of support to prove of use, and this choice will determine where Vrangel's rulership shall lead."

russia.10.t:0 "The Kornilov Affair"
russia.10.d:0 "The news that Kornilov's forces are descending upon Moscow sparked a repeat of 1917 - trade unions and leftist organizations broke out their arms to defend Russia's democracy and Constitution from a soon-to-be dictator. Kornilov chose not to retreat this time, however, and, cooperating with the Combat Squads, the paramilitary of the National Republican Party (NRPR), took the fight to streets. After hours of barricade raising and street clashes, order was finally restored, the Duma dissolved, and a provisional military government installed, headed by the new Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Army and Acting President, Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov.\n\nHowever, he also understands that without a coherent political programme, his control over the country will swiftly be lost. The temporary prime-minister, General Aleksandr Lukomskiy, a well-known supporter of Kornilov, can maintain a modicum of order, but he has awful relations with almost all republican factions in the country. Kornilov's first choice would be to invite Boris Savinkov, the leader of the NRPR, to assume the office of Prime Minister. Though he is far from being on the best of terms with Savinkov, his far-right concept of national renewal sounds very appealing. On the other hand, perhaps Savinkov is too suspicious to trust and Marshal Denikin would help Kornilov consolidate his control over the country..."

russia.37.t:0 "The Kornilov-Savinkov Alliance"
russia.37.d:0 "The boogeyman of any socialist in the Duma and the most powerful far right force in the country, the 'National Republican Party' (Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii) once started out as an anti-Bolshevik conspiracy in Moscow, the 'Union for the Defense of the Motherland'. Its leader, Boris Savinkov, is one of the most interesting political leaders in the country, a former Socialist-Revolutionary terrorist turned nationalist politician, who has developed a political ideology based on his own extreme and somewhat esoteric beliefs, and the influence of his close allies such as Symbolist poet Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy. \n\nHaving remained in the fringe of Russian politics in the 1920s, the NRPR exploded in popularity in the 1930s, its affinity to spectacle politics, populism, paramilitary violence and irredentism attracting many, and even inspiring imitators outside of Russia. Approached by Kornilov, his old ally from back in 1917, Savinkov accepted and has dedicated the NRPR Combat Squads to the apparatus of the state."
russia.37.a:0 "Kornilov and Savinkov shall save holy Russia!"

russia.38.t:0 "Assassination of Maria Spiridonova"
russia.38.d:0 "During a meeting of the left SRs in Moscow, Maria Spiridonova was assassinated by members of Savinkov's Combat Squads. The liquidation of such a prominent Socialist leader provoked an early and consequently ill-organised rebellion against the government. The rising was easily suppressed by a concert of the police and Combat Squads. Today, General Kornilov published a new law prohibiting the Left SR party and proscribing its leaders. With the flower of its leadership cut down by the scythe of the state, the Socialist Revolutionaries no longer pose any threat to the Kornilov-Savinkov dyarchy."

With Kornilov gone nothing stands in the way of Savinkov merging the posts of prime minister and president and thus becoming unassailable in his leadership over Russia. The merger was approved by a dubious plebiscite where more than 90 percent of the electorate voted 'Da' (Yes). Savinkov now rules a potent and aggravated nation, ready to shed itself of the many humiliations faced since the Weltkrieg and step into the sun once more. The Vozhd commands!"
russia.39.d.denikin:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief and President of Russia, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68. Two cliques are poised to seize control after Kornilov's passing. The first, led by Field Marshal Anton Denikin, favours continued authoritarian military rule solidified by strong traditionalism. In opposition stands the young officers of Baron Pyetr Vrangel.

Amongst other things, the directive dismissed the Duma whilst outlawing all political parties besides Savinkov's own 'Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii'. Furthermore, the directive raised the Combat Squads to the status of a state organisation and an auxiliary force to the Russian army, tasked to enforce ideological control of the nation.\n\nTo fulfill his revanchist ideals, Savinkov chose to appoint a close ally of his party, entrepreneur and industrialist Aleksey Putilov, as his Minister of the Economy.

russia.21.d:0 "A famous linguist and historian, Prince Nikolay Trubetskoy turned to politics in the 1930s and has now chosen to codify his ideological doctrine of Eurasianism into a single book - "Genghis Khan's Legacy: A Look at Russian History from the East". It has already begun making rounds across Russian literary circles and crude quotes are being passed around across the public.\n\nEurasianism believes in the concept of "living space" ("mestorazvitiya"), geographical conditions which define the peoples living within them. People who live in the same biome or geographic area form a common civilization and have a natural desire to unite. Russia, in their view, forms the core of a "steppe civilization" which encompasses all peoples in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Eurasianists ascribe them a collective kinship and call for them to unite under Russian rule. Trubetskoy declares that the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and therefore Russia, is the successor to the Mongol Empire and Genghis Khan was a hero of the Russian people.\n\nThis "Russia-Eurasia" needs to embody ideas and beliefs which Eurasianists believe are "Eurasian" - selflessness, heroism, societal hierarchy and obedience. Eurasianists believe that democracy is a form of governance for "sea peoples" and is completely unfitting for Russia - not only should Russia fight against democracy being imposed upon it, but also liberate other non-European nations from Western rule and defeat what they perceive as Western "cultural imperialism".\n\nAfter the publication of the book, its ideas have begun to float around the Russian right."

The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk has been paraded as an example of a punitive treaty since its inception, but only now has Russia gotten confident enough to consider repudiating it. Printing presses are publishing maps and treatises where Russia's western neighbours are declared 'German-occupied Western Territories' and the locals living there are described as suffering, awaiting the return of Mother Russia. This is one issue which can unite the Russian right, left and center, though for different reasons. Russian nationalists obviously seek revenge against Germany, whereas the leftists see Germany as the hegemon which prevents the rise of socialism and Syndicalism in Europe.\n\nNo matter what regime may be in charge, they will need to place the reconquest of Russia's western territories at the top of the priority list. Few want to see Russia start this war, however. The general line of thought among the Russian populace, intellectuals and politicians is that Russia needs to wait. Observe. And descend like a hawk when Germany is focused elsewhere. Cunning has saved Russia in countless wars before, and this moment will be no different."

This alliance, dubbed the "Left Cartel" (Levyj Kartel'), is understandably shaky, but nevertheless presents a serious challenge to established political forces in Russia.

Only the most cynical pessimists could have imagined that in a matter of weeks, Russia would be set ablaze with the fires of revolution once more. Although Kornilov's decision to transfer power to a civilian administration was enough to keep the centrists from breaking ranks with the rightists, the fact remained that the army's heavy-handed methods of mass arrests had caused the left in the country to overwhelmingly move towards more radical parties. With any hope for reform as dead as Kerenskiy, it was only a matter of time before many of them took to the streets.\n\nWhat started out as riots by radicals in Petrograd and Moscow quickly gained steam as the police was unable to quell them. When the army, allegedly acting by orders from Kornilov rather than Dmitriy, stepped in it only made matters worse with its heavy-handed measures. As the days went on the riots grew in intensity with more and more people siding with the reds. Despite the best efforts of the civilian government to keep things under control, the fact of the matter is that it was a government in name only. It'd barely been inaugurated and had already lost any legitimacy it may once have had with a large portion of the country's population, particularly those victimized by Kornilov's draconian measures.\n\nMere days after the riots began to sweep the western parts of the nation, the army was forced to evacuate Dmitriy and his cabinet from the capital. A provisional capital was set up in the east, and already preparations were made to fight to reclaim the western parts of the country. In the old capital, the revolutionaries that seized the moment may have done so without broad popular support, but once they were in power many regions surrounding Moscow and Petrograd soon joined ranks with them as many peasants and intellectuals alike seized the chance to gain by revolution what they could never gain through reform. Though the new socialist government is in a precarious position, it's already taking measures to mobilize militias and and rally popular support as Russia seems to be spiralling towards yet another bloody civil war."
russia.1917.d.kornilov:0 "After the 'Russian counter-revolution' happened no one expected things to calm down anytime soon. Only the most cynical pessimists could have imagined that in a matter of weeks, Russia would be set ablaze with the fires of revolution once more. The heavy-handed approach of mass-arrests and numerous summary executions had managed to push many leftists towards more radical movements. Many liberals and even some conservatives were alienated by the drastic measures taken by the army, quickly eroding the broad support that Kornilov had in the initial days after the coup. Before long there were widespread protests in several major cities in Russia's western regions with only the army to stand against them.\n\nWhat started out as a mixture of people of all stripes voicing their dislike of Kornilov's autocratic methods quickly became dominated by the radical left, something Kornilov was all too happy to use as a justification to crack down even harder against them. As things spiralled out of control, the situation began to resemble that of 1917 more and more by the minute. What started out as soldiers disobeying orders to attack their countrymen soon spiralled into clashes between troops and Bolshevik rioters as the most radical elements on both sides took action when calmer heads seemed paralyzed by confusion and hesitance.\n\nDays after the riots began to sweep the western parts of the nation, Kornilov ordered the bulk of his forces to withdraw eastwards in order to regroup and prepare to fight back against the reds. Meanwhile in the old capital, a loose coalition of moderate socialists and various strands of Bolsheviks had seized power and formed a shaky government. As Kornilov's authority in the west evaporated, many peasants and city-dwellers alike, many victims of the recent repression, soon joined up with the revolutionaries. Though the socialist government's situation is currently precarious at best, it has already started to mobilize militias and army deserters to take arms against Kornilov's expected counter-attack aimed at retaking the capital from the reds.

russia.1918.d:0 "Despite [ROOT.GetLeader] being made interim president of Russia, the country's vast military apparatus was still dominated by the Whites, who would be at best distrustful of someone of his background. The same could also be said for many civilian officials, as well as the masses of Russians that resented the left. When he failed to restore any semblance of order after the assassination of Kerenskiy, it was only a matter of time before the government fell apart. [ROOT.GetLeader] was despised by the right from the moment he assumed office, was far too much of a socialist to be considered a compromise candidate by the liberals, and was even unable to rally Russia's left due to the utter paralysis of his administration.\n\nFearing that [ROOT.GetLeader]'s failing government would crumble and give way to a syndicalist takeover, several reactionary officers led by Lavr Kornilov made their move at the crack of dawn. Thanks to widespread treachery within the army, intelligence services and civilian institutions, they were able to seize multiple key government buildings and strategic infrastructure both in the capital and across the country before loyalists could put up any resistance. In a radio address heard from Smolensk all the way to Kamchatka, Kornilov declared that the age of anarchy was over and that the army had once more liberated Russia from the reds.\n\nBy noon, the interim government was no more. [ROOT.GetLeader] was placed under arrest and garrisons in several major cities began rounding up prominent leftist politicians and their supporters. While many Russian conservatives, nationalists and even some liberals were cheering on the developments, others watched in horror as Kornilov brutally destroyed any hope of political reform. No matter how Kornilov acted from here on, few in Russia or abroad considered this the end of the nation's troubles.\n\nFor now, though, Kornilov and his aides had to decide how Russia would be governed. While he feels quite confident in both his ability to rule and in the necessity of a strong hand in such times, advisors close to him insist that he should win the hearts and minds of the Russian people by restoring the senate and announcing elections. The top candidate for the job is Dmitriy Romanov, an avid supporter of the counter-revolution and one of Russia's most influential rightist politicians."

russia.1949.d.kornilov:0 "When Kornilov overthrew Russia's legitimate government he killed Russia's democracy in its infancy and signaled to millions of Russians that a return to autocracy was inevitable. As thousands were marched off to the jails, many more took to the streets to protest. Protests turned into riots, and into a revolution. Gaining widespread popular support against the draconian measures undertaken by the Kornilov junta, the revolutionary ranks quickly swelled. With only the most strident rightists remaining in Kornilov's fold, the hardened and veteran White Army soon found itself pushed back by the vast numbers of the reconstituted Red Army. In the end, with only Siberia to retreat towards, they eventually fragmented. Though holdouts will likely remain past the Urals for quite some time, the White Movement has been thoroughly defeated and stands no chance of reversing its fortunes.\n\nThough the vanguard of the revolution was initially sidelined by more moderate elements that joined up simply to stand up against the prospect of a stratocracy, there's no doubt that this is a victory won by the radical socialists. No matter what path the fledgling Russian Socialist Republic takes after this, she will remain firmly in the socialist bloc for years to come. Indeed, the prospects of a socialist Russia joining forces with the syndicalists in Paris is already keeping many strategists in the Reichspakt up at night."
russia.1949.d.dmitriy:0 "When Kornilov overthrew Russia's socialist government, he seemed to be aware of the possible ramifications of assuming power all by himself. As such, he was quick to announce the transition of power from the military to the rightist forces in the Senate. Despite this however, the act of overthrowing what many still saw as Russia's legitimate government served to radicalize millions and sway them towards radical socialism. Made out of a revolutionary vanguard, their revolution spread quickly in the western parts of Russia despite lacking much in the way of widespread popular support at first. As it started to rack up victories against the White Movement, however, the revolutionary vanguard took control over one city after another from the fledgling democracy. In the end, the radical socialists managed to push them into Siberia and once their last major fallback capital fell, the movement evaporated. Though disorganized resistance will likely linger east of the Urals for years to come, the vanguard's victory has been achieved.\n\nMade out of a hardened core of revolutionaries, Russia is now controlled by the most radical socialists in the movement. Whether they'll remain in power or if the socialist republic moves to more orthodox interpretations of syndicalism now that the war is over remains to be seen. Whatever happens, however, Russia will remain firmly in the socialist bloc for years to come. Indeed, the prospects of a communistic Russia joining forces with the syndicalists in Paris is already keeping many strategists in the Reichspakt up at night."

Though it had widespread popular support at first, that quickly melted away as a resurgent White Movement started to rack up more and more victories against the 'socialist menace'. As the war went on, the Russian Socialist Republic slowly but surely started to lose the soft support it'd once enjoyed from more moderate elements of Russian society that were repulsed by Kornilov's power grab. By the end, only the most ideologically strident socialists remained to hold the torch of revolution against the seemingly unstoppable advances of the White Army.\n\nIn the end, the Second Russian Civil War ended much like the last one had with the defeat of the reds. What's different this time, however, is that there is no Kerenskiy, no Duma to speak of, not any other person or institution left that can oppose the White Movement. As suspected dissidents and stragglers are rounded up and the last vestiges of socialism are being erased from the few villages that still hold out, there can be no doubt that this is a victory without compromises for the military. International observers all seem to be in unanimous agreement that with the complete eradication of Russia's left and the hollowing out of the centre, the country's almost inevitably going to remain a right-wing autocracy for years to come. Kornilov's vision of a firm hand to protect Russia from Bolshevism has now come to pass."
russia.1951.d.dmitriy:0 "Today marks the end of the Second Russian Civil War, a bloody affair that started out as a revolt led by a communist vanguard against a fledgling democracy that failed to get back on its feet after the assassination of Aleksandr Kerenskiy. Its promises quickly spread in the large cities in the west where years of mismanagement and Kornilov's brief draconian reign had taken their toll, but was eventually stopped dead in its tracks when Dmitriy Romanov managed to rally the rest of Russia against the far-left radicals. With most of the nation and the army eventually siding with Dmitriy's government over the socialist upstarts, the reds were eventually pushed out of their last few cities with only a few holdouts remaining in the countryside.\n\nIn the end, the Russian civil war ended much like the last one - with the defeat of the socialists and the preservation of a shaky democratic institution still in its infancy. Although initially seen by many as a stooge of the White Army, the government led by [ROOT.GetLeader] is holding true to its promises that democracy will be preserved in Russia and that the people have won their freedom back against a violent revolutionary mob. Be that as it may, no one doubts that with two bloody civil wars fresh within its memory, Russia will likely remain firmly within the rightist camp for years to come."

The White forces in the Russian Civil War operated their own measures against Bolshevik subversion, and several departments were formed under the Ministry of Internal Affairs to fulfill the same purpose, such as the Third Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, or the Gendarmerie. Aleksandr Kerenskiy's government used these institutions with little hesitation to prevent a second Revolution, the most famous of their actions was the assassination of Tambov revolutionary Aleksandr Antonov. \n\nBy mid 1935, the President was planning to reorganize the internal police and establish the Department for Protecting Order (Otdeleniye po Okhraneniyu Poryadka), which would bear the same name as the Tsarist Okhrana.

Others, such as General Sergey Markov, were impressed by the effectiveness of armored cars, tanks and trains during the Weltkrieg and hope to organize the army around this armored breakthrough priority.

A coalition of democratically inclined parties in the State Duma have banded together to maintain stability and elect an Acting President until the Elections of 1937.

Elected Acting President, he immediately activated Article 48 of the Constitution to grant himself emergency powers and suspend civil liberties in the name of public order.\n\nA few hours later, he took to the radio waves, informing the startled Russian people of exactly what had just happened, and explained that though this was a difficult decision for him, a military man first and foremost, he could not stand by and watch his beloved nation decay.

On the other hand, this does limit the scope of what they can achieve. The moment we step in, however, the government in [RUS.Capital.GetName] will be held responsible for anything that fails.\n\nFor this reason, some are recommending cautious - if any - investments on our part. While some cite the need to not get involved in every minor issue in every Siberian hamlet, more market-oriented ministers cite that the Zemstva have largely been doing just fine without our direct intervention and that the state should allow the local governance to function as intended. Other ministers, however, prefer a more direct approach by the government and insist that we can't let a handful of irresponsible career politicians blind us to the potential benefits we could reap by providing state funding to the Zemstva."

[RUS_zemstvo_state.GetName] recently experienced this first-hand when a group of wealthy merchants used their wealth to buy their way into attaining considerable influence over the local Zemstva. With little oversight, they were able to embezzle a good deal of money meant to go to the state's coffers before law enforcement managed to shut their operation down.

After several months of cooperation, the Mensheviks have finally broken with their Socialist-Revolutionary allies. This has once again left the Russian left splintered.

rusd.125.d:0 "Maintenance of the democratic regime combined with the stable development of the state led to the emigration of some celebrities from syndicalist countries to Russia. This led, for example, to the arrival in Russia of the good friend of Dmitriy Pavlovich, Coco Chanel. That mademoiselle Chanel has chosen to open her office in a village near Tula shows that Russia is a Bastion of Democracy, where everyone can run his or her business without difficulties from the government."

rusd.126.t:0 "Churchill's Iron Curtain Speech"
rusd.126.d:0 "Germany's defeat at the hands of combined French and Russian arms six months ago has sent shockwaves across the world, and it has become apparent that this 'Second Weltkrieg' has changed the face of Europe for years to come. The continent has been divided between the Third Internationale and the Russian bloc, both of which wield enormous forces and have a bone to pick with the other side. And yet, neither of them have chosen to strike first, leaving the continent split in twain.\n\nThe Petrograd University in Russia has had the honour of hosting Sir Winston Churchill, a noted British statesman, writer, and former First Lord of the Admiralty of Britain. Speaking to the attending students, Churchill first made sure to note the great sacrifices which the Russian nation has made during the Second Weltkrieg, and assured that the British Empire and Russia shall always be natural allies in this new world order. The politician described Europe as a continent divided between two fundamentally different forces - one of liberty and one of Syndicalist terror, one of good and one of evil, and that an Iron Curtain divides them. He expresses his dismay that so much of Europe's heritage and famous cities now lie in the "French sphere", and hope that Russia and the Commonwealth can unite against this revolutionary threat.\n\nThough Churchill was not the first to express this idea, the striking imagery of his speech have set a new checkpoint in history. Europe, and with it, the world have been divided in a frozen conflict, one of ideological strife rather than power balance. It may only be solved via subversion, arms race and diplomacy... or a conflict far more destructive than the Second Weltkrieg."

Accepting this proposal will surely boost the strength of our army and give significant propaganda value - but conservative elements in our armed forces, unwilling to change the status quo, have to be taken into consideration as well..."

rusd.131.d:0 "Maria Spiridonova's death was a severe blow to the Left SR, but many enemies of Savinkov's regime remain. As time passed, the Vozhd has turned increasingly paranoid that he will go the way of the tyrants his younger self eliminated with a bomb in his hand, and to ease this paranoia, the National Republican Party has put a plan into action. Russian newspapers have increasingly begun to speak of a 'plot against Russia', orchestrated by Syndicalists and socialists in cahoots with Germany and the other powers, numerous high ranking public figures such as Dmitriy Merezhovskiy and Dmitriy Romanov have published their own articles in which they assert that some "bloodletting" is necessary to restore stability in Russia.\n\nUnder the organization of Minister of the Interior, [RUS.GetMinisterOfInterior], a wave of mass crackdowns on suspected political opponents has begun. The Okhrana has been given extraordinary powers to search homes and arrest dissidents without the approval of any judicial institution, several notable leftist politicians and publicists have disappeared off the face of Russia outright. While some are given show trials, others, especially the rank and file of the SR, Mensheviks and Syndicalist parties, are summarily executed or deported. Savinkov has personally presided over several of the show trials, especially those for his old comrades in the Socialist Revolutionaries. In private, to Merezhovskiy, he has remarked how much of a catharsis it is to see the Okhrana, the police he used to flee from and fear three decades ago, now bow to his every whim."

Will we leave them in trouble? Never. Will we save them? Yes, because we cannot abandon our brothers and sisters. We are the Phoenix that was destroyed and yet reborn. Wait for us - we will come.' - millions of Russians would hear today on their radios, declared by several energetic speakers under the state propaganda services. The NRPR always decreed irredentism as their primary goal in foreign policy and they were going to live up to their promises. \n\nThough Savinkov's expansionist plans cannot be realised right now, this declaration of common blood and common struggle shows that Russia won't avoid confrontation with the German Empire anymore."

rusd.133.t:0 "National Rebirth"
rusd.133.d:0 "Though Savinkov has never been much of a public speaker, his National Republican Party has always been one of spectacle politics, and their growth in power has only made this more visible. Mass rallies of NRPR members are held across the country, hundreds of thousands attending and flooding the streets to intimidate political opponents with this display of popular might. Armed members of the Combat Squads, Savinkov's personal paramilitary, maintain order - their black uniforms, modelled after the Kornilov Regiment from the Civil War era, make them easily stand out from the crowd. The speakers in these rallies vary in their topics and invoked themes, but a few of them are shared - Russia's impending national rebirth and return to greatness, the complete reformation of the state, and the role of two living giants in seeing this through - Lavr Kornilov and Boris Savinkov.\n\nStarting with "The Pale Horse", Savinkov has consistently invoked the theme of "national rebirth" in his literature. Borrowing the original concept from Russian Symbolists, such as Dmitriy Merezhkovskiy, he asserts that a new, stronger Russia will be born through pain and suffering, and this third Russia, neither Tsarist nor democratic, will be able to assert its rightful place among the Great Powers. Though Savinkov has never personally used the term, his emphasis on nationality, national unity, and the power of the masses, the populus, to restore national glory, got the intellectual Nikolay Trubetskoy to dub it "National Populism" (Natsionalniy populizm). When he coined the term in the 1920s, Trubetskoy meant it in a negative light, implying that it is little more than populistic slogans, but it has since become popular, even among parties outside of Russia who try to imitate the NRPR."

Forgotten and unremarkable wasteland in the North-East suburbs of Moscow was turned into an ideal model of the future of Russia. Facades of the pavilions of the Russian regions showed the strategic meeting of architectural traditions with the arts and crafts of each part of the country together with motives of important collective labour. Moreover, this exhibition is used by the government to help the farmers to establish contacts between them and the new regime and also to conclude long-term contracts with the Republic."

rusd.135.d:0 "Though Savinkov and Kornilov have established a dictatorship, disputes between Savinkov's NRPR republicans and Kornilov's young officers can still endanger the cooperation of these two sides of the new regime. It is obvious that the government can't allow the left radicals in the State Duma and the monarchists in the Senate to use these controversies to destroy the rule of the army and the NRPR. To prevent such unwanted events, Savinkov has proposed a recreation of the Supreme Privy Council ('Verkhovnyi Tainyi Sovet'), which once had both executive and legislative power and consisted of a small number of the most important Russian ministers. Membership of the SPC, known as "Verkhovniki", will consist of 3 party members with Savinkov on top along with Kornilov and 3 of his old comrades from the Russian Army. The Council will be able to issue executive orders, which will have superiority over Russian law."

With the creation of the SPC Yusupov has finally understood how he can get one of the highest posts in the Russian Republic. Yusupov has proposed to create the united civil and military engineering organisation with him on the top, which will use Yusupov's money as a start-up capital. But in exchange for this necessary investment for our country, Feliks asks us to make him the new 'Verkhovnik'."

rusd.140.d:0 "Almost immediately upon assuming power as President, Dmitriy Romanov began looking into all the ways he could possibly expand his power while remaining in the trappings of the Constitution. The document has got enough errors that it did not take a long time - soon, the President appeared before the Duma again, this time to announce his "New Course" (Noviyi Kurs). Under this reform program to the Constitution, the powers of the State Duma have been limited for an indefinite duration of time, and while they remain the main legislative organ in the state, they now have to share their powers with the Senate, which has received the power of legislative initiative, as well as the ability to promulgate executive orders bypassing the Duma outright. As the Senate is far more loyal to the new president than the Duma ever was, it means that Dmitriy has gained a powerful tool at his disposal in order to reform the state to his whim."

The Senators claim that such elite gymnasiums should be restored to be sure that the best representatives of the next Russian generation will have perfect conditions for study. Otherwise we can support the public schools, though it is clear that they will never reach the level of the old gymnasiums…"

With the opening of the new gymnasiums the old tradition was reborn and became very popular and attractive for the students all over the Russian cities and towns, where the Gymnasiums were founded. What is really surprising is that even some students from the public school try to take part in these balls, using the masks. Let's hope that this nice tradition won't disappear in the future."

rusd.143.d:0 "The richest people of Russia, who are partially represented in the Senate could take back some of their mansions after the awful land redistribution in the Civil war, but they suffered a lot from the high land taxes of the Kerenskiy's regime. Though these taxes are really profitable for our economy, the loyalty of the Senators are highly important for the realisation of the policies of Dmitriy Pavlovich. There is a possible solution to this problem - the mansions of some senators can be secured by the Republic as historical heritage - it means that the Senators will pay the taxes, but the government will partially invest into the maintenance of these buildings."

They have proposed a program of the events to show the role of Nikolay II for the Russian people all over the country.

The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, but also doesn't forget to analyse various propositions of the Senate became the real leader of the Russians and got many new allies even in the State Duma. That's why the Senate unanimously decided to give Dmitriy Romanov the broad powers, which even the last tsar Nikolay II and president Kerenskiy didn't have. Nothing can stop the Duke from the modernisation of Russia, which will allow the republic to take its place under the Sun!"

The Grand Duke, who controls the country with an iron fist in a velvet glove, paid no attention to the ideas of this state authority. That's why the majority of the Senate decided to revoke the broad powers, which were given to the Duke one year ago.

All the massive rallies they constantly hold and armed paramilitaries they own are not free, however. Hoping to break from obscurity as quickly as possible, Savinkov and the NRPR took loan after loan to fund their political campaigns, and they hoped that they would be able to write off all of their debts upon coming to power. This has not happened and the National Populist movement has found itself severely indebted, with no way to pay off their staff or workers, and popular support for them waning because of ongoing economic stabilization.\n\nSavinkov was forced to lay off campaigners, disband many of the party's branches, and significantly cut the size of the Combat Squads. His movement has started to splinter, the left wing has broken off and its leaders began blasting Savinkov in national newspapers, accusing him of running the NRPR as a clique of yesmen... all in all, it has not been a good year for them. Popular support for the NRPR has decayed, their rallies have ceased, and their deputies in the Duma have chosen to ally with the Octobrists and Eurasianists.\n\nIt appears that Savinkov's hopes of taking power in Russia have been dashed for good."

rusd.148.d:0 "Eminent professor Nikolay Ustryalov has published a history of the Russian Revolution and the Civil War, sparking discourse among intellectuals. In his history, Ustryalov presents a massive break from standard Russian historiography, delving deep into the political and social policy of the Bolshevik movement and doing away with its villainization. He states that while the bloodshed committed during the Russian civil war was unacceptable and could not be tolerated, Vladimir Lenin and his followers had very clear reformist goals, some of which they implemented - such as calendar reform, land reform, and equality between sexes. If the Bolsheviks were more moderate in their approach, a Russia led by them could have been stronger in the long term. Ustryalov even challenges the limits of our tolerance by considering that the Bolsheviks were the only 'nationalist' faction in the Civil War - they were supported by no one, whereas the White movement was supported by the Entente Powers and later by Germany.\n\nMore right wing intellectuals, such as Ustryalov's former ally Nikolay Trubetskoy, have challenged this viewpoint, creating a debate in the scientific community on how the Russian Civil War should be treated. It is thanks to our liberal, democratic society that this debate can take place without any intervention from above."

The so-called 'Russo-German Study Society' has been established in Moscow and unites a circle of historians, writers, and politicians who all share staunch right-wing ideals. In its first proclamation, the Society has stated that Russia should finally come to terms with the losses of Brest-Litovsk, and strike an agreement with Germany to reclaim Caucasus and Central Asia in exchange for forming an anti-Syndicalist axis. This 'Berlin-Moscow Axis' would be able to overcome Syndicalism through sheer combined might and manpower.\n\nThe Society's call to abandon Russian irredentism in the West has eroded the influence it could have over our policy, however."

Though it holds massive potential, many sacrifices will have to be made before Russia will be able to repudiate the treaty of Brest-Litovsk. Which is why these sacrifices have been proposed.

Its political program calls for extensive political and social reform to maintain stability and prevent the growth of radical left wing forces, it is funded by several industrialist lobbies and supported by aristocrats.\n\nThe National Bloc has thrown its full weight behind President Romanov, granting him and his government a stable base of supporters in both houses of Parliament."

Dmitriy Romanov, Grand Duke of the House of Romanov and member of the Senate, has been elected as the new President of Russia with a narrow majority of Octobrists, Russian nationalists, Eurasianists, and right wing Kadets. Playing the role of a "Modern Romanov", Dmitriy finds his appeal among conservative republicans and constitutional monarchists alike, both of whom see a savior in the man. After getting elected by the Senate, the Grand Duke declared it as his first intention to restore stability to the fallen nation - surprisingly, or perhaps not so, he made sure to omit any promises to support democracy in particular. Neither he nor the right-wing Senators who stand behind his back are all that thrilled with the democratic governance which the Left champions, although they're fine with paying lip service to it.\n\nThe people await the first actions of their new President."

This means that it is very easy to blame Russia's faults and weaknesses not on inaction, not on the failures of the current government, but on the Bolsheviks who supposedly ruined it all - and the NRPR is sure to take advantage of this myth. History textbooks are being amended, a mass propaganda campaign started, and the message sent that the Bolshevik uprising was not just an ordinary uprising. An international conspiracy, one which sought to destroy holy Russia and make sure it never rises again, was responsible for funding the Bolshevik Party and supplying their uprising across central Russia, and were it not stopped by force of arms, it would have left Russia broken, destroyed and shattered. These textbooks make sure to note the fact that Vladimir Lenin had been sent to Petrograd by the Germans, and that many of the leading members of the Bolshevik Party were not Russian - Caucasians, Balts, Poles, and especially Jews."

As long as they did not raise too much of a fuss, they were allowed to keep on living and doing their jobs. The extent to which Russia is rapidly being transformed to Savinkov's wishes intimidates them, as much as it did the socialists, and so they ultimately decided they had enough. Viktor Chernov, Pavel Milyukov and Ariadna Tyrkova-Williams have collectively drafted a manifesto in which they declared the formation of a Movement to Restore the Constitution and sent a demand to Savinkov to resign and allow free elections. \n\nSavinkov was not pleased, and the regime immediately moved against the democrats. A crackdown on democratic leaders has begun, numerous newspapers have been closed and their editors arrested, and the prisons overflowing with political arrests yet again. The downfall of the democratic constitutionalists left the last possible challenge to Savinkov's unquenched ambition dead in a ditch."

rusd.160.d:0 "Though thousands have already been summarily executed and many more arrested for real or suspected crimes, Savinkov's paranoia has not been satiated. Enemies still lurk at every corner to him and the Syndicalists may come for his head any moment now. This is where one of the rising stars in the National Republican Party and the Deputy Minister of Interior, Viktor Abakumov, stepped in to offer a solution. To ensure that the Vozhd's rule is forever solid and his regime lasts a thousand years, the Russian nation must learn to fear, and above all else, its enemies must learn to fear.\n\nAbakunov's brainchild is a purge not from the top down, done via orders to arrest this dissident or that dissident, but instead from the bottom up. All regional governors need to be given quotas of "enemies of the state" they need to find, extract, and purge. Those who do not deserve a bullet to the back of the head should work off their debt instead - the Tsarist Okhrana laid the groundwork for deporting thousands of dissidents to Siberia, but this system can be modernized, industrialized, and turned into an archipelago of destruction. Even those who are not plotting against Russia must know their place - Abakunov offers to incentivize ratting out possible enemies of the state in workplaces, schools or even families, creating an atmosphere of worry and uncertainty under which the masses will flock to the only thing which can keep them safe, loyalty to the Vozhd.\n\nEven fellow members of the NRPR believe that Abakumov's proposal is... crazy, but Savinkov has taken personal interest in the proposal."

rusd.161.t:0 "Trial of the Left Separatists"
rusd.161.d:0 "The NRPR's policy towards Russia's numerous ethnic minorities has always been very abstract. Though much of its support comes from Russian nationalists, Savinkov himself recognizes that Russia is too ethnically divided for him to be able to go too far. What he and the Party can do, however, is take action against Russia's ethnic minorities via proxy. During the Russian Civil War, many ethnic minority groups joined the Bolshevik side, hoping to achieve autonomy in a greater Soviet Russia, and thus gained the collective term of "Left Separatists".\n\nCiting this as an example of possible minority disloyalty, Savinkov's regime has begun the move against them, pressuring numerous ethnic newspapers to close and arresting hundreds of high profile minority politicians, such as Jews, Tatars, Finns, Volga Germans, and Yakuts. Minority regions have had their administration staffed with "loyalists", generally Russians."

rusd.163.t:0 "Pavel Gorgulov and the KPZ-NRPR"
rusd.163.d:0 "Rapidly growing in strength during the 1930s, the NRPR absorbed several other far right parties in the Russian sphere to its enormous mass, all of them bringing political concepts and ideas of their own. One of these was the Peasant Green Party (Kryestyanskoy partii zelyonikh), led by Pavel Gorgulov, a Kuban Cossack writer and political ideologue. Though as Russian chauvinist, anti-semitic and nationalist as any other member in Savinkov's party, the KPZ emphasizes the connection which the Russian people have with the soil and with the peasant life.\n\nAfter Savinkov's takeover of Russia, Pavel Gorgulov, now appointed as the Minister of Agriculture, has began taking on tours across the country, bringing the message of the NRPR to dozens of villages across Central and Southern Russia. His call of "Russia for Russians" and this emphasis on the "national peasantry" reflects in the reforms he's undertaken ever since his appointment - their aim is to turn Russian villages into tightly knit, ethnically pure communities, perfectly obedient to the Vozhd and representative of Russian national superiority.\n\nGorgulov's views are also highly esoteric and even his subordinates aren't sure whether he is... sane. His emphasis on the peasantry culminates in his messianic belief that "wild, primitive and Scythian" Russian civilization will prevail over Western civilization and establish a new order across the world. His somewhat low ranking role in the government means that this creed has little influence over the government, although his "agrarian" faction within the NRPR, composed mostly of former members of the KPZ, stand by his ideology."

This, and the recent surge of Arabian nationalism, originating from Egypt and Hashemite Arabia, puts our state and its foreign interest in grave danger. To have any hope to survive the approaching struggles with our hostile Arabian neighbours, we must quickly stabilise our eastern borders.

Its breadbasket, Ukraine, was turned into an independent state, the Baku oil fields fell from their grasp, their presence in the Baltic Sea was eliminated with the formation of the United Baltic Duchy, and Reichspakt troops stand in striking distance from its new capital Moscow. In the intervening decades, German influence helped weaken Russia further by backing Pyetr Krasnov's rebellion in the Don-Kuban region. All of it was done with the perception that Russia will always be the greatest threat to German domination of Europe - France may be Germany's eternal rival and Britain rule the waves, but Russia, if left alone, can muster the manpower and resources needed to topple Berlin.\n\nOur diplomatic services in Moscow have caught onto the Russian government's new plans of expansion. Our Foreign Ministry is well aware that Russia has been rebuilding internally in the past few years, and now they seek to restore order to the Caucasus region. If left unchecked, the Don-Kuban chernozem and Azerbaijani oil reserves will fuel a Russian war machine which will be able to overturn Brest-Litovsk!

Now, however, Russia seems ready to reincorporate this petty state into the Motherland. How shall we proceed?

rusfor.1275.d:0 "Good news from Central Asia - new Tatar and Bashkir Muslim leadership could finally reorganise the system of the local Islamic institutions and partly defeat the obscurantism of the local notable theologians and preachers. Now Orenburg Muslim Spiritual Assembly proposes a new vision of Islam for the Central Asian citizens, which means, that Central Asia will be loyal enough to us and we will be able to pay less attention to this region of Russia."
rusfor.1275.a:0 "That's great!"

rusfor.1276.t:0 "Control over Azerbaijan"
rusfor.1276.d:0 "Since we have given our guarantees to Azerbaijan, the Russian business uses the profits of the cooperation between two countries. Maybe now it is the best time to expand our control over this Caucasian country and strengthen our positions in the Caspian region?"
rusfor.1276.a:0 "Let's do it!"
rusfor.1276.b:0 "We don't need it."

rusfor.1277.t:0 "Restoring control over the Northern Caucasus."
rusfor.1277.d:0 "After the reunification of Don-Kuban with Russia, our government faced the problem of integration of the eastern mountainous districts of the former Cossack state. During the 1920s and early 1930s Ataman Krasnov supported the Terek Cossack Host, which consisted of many Russians, Ossetians and other Christian nations, who kept this part of the Caucasus under Yekaterinodar's control. We have currently deployed the Russian army in the region, but this is a temporary measure. Multiple plans for the reconstruction and pacification of the region have been proposed and we should choose one of them."
rusfor.1277.a:0 "Put the region under control of the local civilian Russians."
rusfor.1277.b:0 "Continue Krasnov's policy - support the Terek Cossack Host and its nations."
rusfor.1277.c:0 "Keep the region under military control!"

rusfor.1278.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is partially restored."
rusfor.1278.d1:0 "After we had restored military bases in such towns of the Northern Caucasus as Vladikavkaz and Grozny and had left here the limited part of the troops, we have transferred the control over this territory to the local Russians, who had been both members of the Terek Cossack Host or just citizens in the various towns and villages. It seems that while the Russian part of the region has begun to recover very quickly, the districts without Russian involvement are sliding into anarchy and tribal wars. Now many leaders of the non-Russian nations of the Northern Caucasus ask us to restore control over the whole region and promise that they will serve well to the Russian government, since it is the only power, which can secure the region from the eternal crisis."
rusfor.1278.d2:0 "Since we started to support the Terek Cossack Host, we could reach an order rather quick, but because our support exceeded the extent of the support from Krasnov's government, the Host started to expand itself over the non-Christian territory of the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus, which naturally led to the multiple conflicts, especially between the Russians and Ossetians on one side and the Chechens and Ingushes on the other. Moreover, the readiness of the Russian government to deal with the local small nations and tribes led to conflicts with them in Dagestan, where many nations want to become a junior partner of Russia and dominate over their neighbours using Russian protection. All these conflicts will be solved by our government, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.d3:0 "We kept the army deployed in the eastern part of the Northern Caucasus and it brought the order to the Russian part of this land, where the local citizens are finally free from the raids and attacks of the mountainous nations. But in the non-Russian parts of the region only some Christian nations support our army, while in some Muslim villages the local people try to start a guerrilla against Russia. No doubt we will stop it and punish the criminals, but it will take some time."
rusfor.1278.a:0 "We should have expected it."

rusfor.1279.t:0 "The order in the Northern Caucasus is restored."
rusfor.1279.d:0 "More than six months have passed since we had retaken Don-Kuban Union. We could finally restore control over the whole region and set up new local authorities, which help us to pacify the Northern Caucasus. The local Russians and other Christian nations have strengthened their positions and are finally free from raids and attacks of the hostile tribes, rebellious nations accepted our rule and the criminals who fought against us either died or immigrated. A new era of prosperity in the Russian South finally starts!"
rusfor.1279.a:0 "Perfect!"

Savinkov and his ‘National Republican Party of Russia’ (NRPR) had been growing in influence in Russia long before Kerenskiy’s death. The NRPR and Savinkov have promised to free Russia from the chains of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and bring the Russian people to their former glory.

### Events
ass.1.t:0 "Ma'dān Shelter Criminals"
ass.1.d:0 "The Ma'dān, or Marsh Arabs, who inhabit the marshes near the city of Basra have long been a thorn in the side of central authority in the region just as their marshland home has been all but terra incognita for the Ottoman administration. Explorers who venture into their lands never return, and the Ma'dān who cooperate with outside authorities often find themselves severely punished by their local leaders in retaliation. The inhospitable nature of their marshes has, up until now, mostly ensured their autonomy, and their political apathy towards the Ottoman regime has kept them off the radar.\n\nRecent Assyrian damming and settlement projects made in an effort to develop new agricultural land and to flush out the Shiite resistance fighting the Assyrian settlers have forced them to take a more active stance; now, the Marsh Arabs are not only sheltering fugitives from Assyrian operations but also those of the Baghdadi Wali. The latter, angered by this development, has requested reinforcements from Konstantiniyye to bring them in line and impose both taxes and conscription for the Ottoman army."
ass.1.a:0 "Leave them be."
ass.1.b:0 "Accept his request."

ass.2.t:0 "Massacre in Al-Qurnah"
ass.2.d:0 "The site of the now-famous Battle of Al-Qurnah during the initial phase of the Mesopotamian Campaign of the Weltkrieg, the eponymous city of Al-Qurnah became home to a large community of Assyrian refugees and settlers following the war. While relations between the Assyrian settlers and the local (predominantly Ma'dān Arab) population have never been warm, tensions escalated earlier this week as thirty Assyrian settlers were massacred in a raid on their quarter with the destruction of fifty more homes. The Assyrian local government has already declared the action a deed of extreme barbary and, in addition to demanding support from the Ottoman Army to push the Ma'dān further into the marshes, has called up its own local militia forces, the Assyrian Levies, who have largely assumed peacekeeping and policing duties in the British-controlled regions of Basra Vilayet."
ass.2.a:0 "Send a detachment from Baghdad."
ass.2.b:0 "Order the Assyrian Levies to stand down."

ass.3.t:0 "Assyrian Levies Exact Revenge for Al-Qurnah"
ass.3.d:0 "In retaliation for the murder of Assyrians and the destruction of their property, the Assyrian local government has sent out the Assyrian Levies to exact revenge on the Ma'dān. Burning down multiple villages and driving the Marsh Arabs further into the swamps and marshes of Southern Mesopotamia, their actions show a clear intent to forefully dislocate the native population in order to acquire more fertile land.\n\nThe Wali in Basra has requested confirmation from the government to disband the Assyrian Levies, as he fears that further actions could lead to a massacre rivaling the Lebanese Civil War, which took place only a few decades ago. However, he also sees in this challenge an opportunity to weaken the autonomy of the Assyrians and hasten their full integration into the new Ottoman society."
ass.3.a:0 "Disband the Levies!"
ass.3.b:0 "Leave them be."

ass.4.t:0 "Shimun XXI Eshai Pleads for the Preservation of the Assyrian Levies"
ass.4.d:0 "The Patriarch of Babylon and de-facto leader of the Assyrian community, Shimun XXI Eshai, has pleaded for permission to maintain the Assyrian Levies. Without them, he says, his people are fully left to the mercy of Muslim gendarmerie forces and have no way to prevent the Marsh Arabs from murdering more Assyrians."
ass.4.a:0 "Nonsense! The Ottoman Gendarmerie protects all, regardless of religion."
ass.4.b:0 "Allow them to maintain the Levies."

ass.5.t:0 "Assyrian Government Refuses Demands"
ass.5.d:0 "Continuing to maintain that the Levies are the only thing between life and death for the Assyrian people, Rab Khaila Dawid d’Mar Shimun has rescinded the order from the Wali in Basra and has mobilised his troops. Backed by the Church of the East, Shimun has declared Basra an autonomous region within the empire and has demanded immediate withdrawal of the Wali's forces from the region, self-government for the Assyrian people, the right to collect taxes independently, and further protection of the Assyrian Church from Shiite discontent.\n\nThe Wali of Basra has, in response, mobilised the city's gendarmerie to disband the Levies, by force if necessary. However, he finds himself substantially outgunned and outnumbered within the city. In Konstantiniyye, the Grand Vizier is furious at this betrayal, and has demanded all Mesopotamian troops mobilised to put down the Assyrian insurrection before foreign intervention in their favour can occur."
ass.5.a:0 "Send in the Army!"
#ass.5.b:0 "Assyria shall not fall!" #The final insult, play as Assyria

ass.6.t:0 "Assyrian Revolt Crushed"
ass.6.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Assyrian revolt has been crushed by our vastly superior army. Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai has ordered his government to lay down their weapons. Our sources say he was spotted embarking on an unmarked Indian vessel bound for Delhi just before the fall of Basra. With this action, no organised resistance remains in Southern Iraq, and Ottoman might is once again victorious."
ass.6.a:0 "Praise Allah!"

# Entente Mediation
ass.7.t:0 "Shimun XXI Eshai Pleads for Assistance"
ass.7.d:0 "Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East and de-facto ruler of the Assyrian State, which has just declared its independence, Shimun XXI Eshai requests assistance in the fight against the Ottoman authorities. Having served with distinction in the Mesopotamian Campaign during the Weltkrieg and as civil servants and industrialists in our economic concessions in Basra following the war, the Assyrians are our closest allies on the ground within the influence of the Porte and are used by our nationals to direct British affairs in Iraq.\n\nHowever, despite their close ties to the Entente, many in our government see this development as a premature attempt by the Assyrians to break free, both ruining their own chances of survival should they be defeated (which is very likely without our support) and compromising the fragile relation between ourselves and the Porte, which will surely react unkindly to any attempts to meddle in their internal affairs."
ass.7.a:0 "Intervene directly in the Middle East!"
ass.7.b:0 "Open negotiations with the Ottomans."
ass.7.c:0 "We cannot risk our relations with the Ottomans."

ass.8.t:0 "[CAN.GetName] Demands an End to Hostilities in Basra"
ass.8.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Canadian government has dared to directly interfere in our domestic affairs. They are demanding an immediate withdrawal of all Ottoman forces from Basra Vilayet, and calling for an end to hostilities with the newly proclaimed Assyrian state. Not only would conceding inflict immense damage on the prestige of the Porte, it would likely also give rise to increased separatism elsewhere in the empire, most notably amongst the Greeks and Arabs."
ass.8.a:0 "We will not stand down!"
ass.8.b:0 "We have no choice but to give in..."

ass.9.t:0 "[OTT.GetName] Refuses Demands"
ass.9.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Sublime Porte has refused our ultimatum and has increased its operations in Basra in an attempt to bring a quick and decisive end to the Assyrian revolt. From Ottawa to Delhi, Entente troops are mobilising to fight once more besides the Assyrian Levies and secure both their independence, and more importantly, the vital oil deposits of Iraq."
ass.9.a:0 "Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!" 

ass.10.t:0 "[OTT.GetName] Concedes to Our Demands"
ass.10.d:0 "Fearful of another extended military campaign in Mesopotamia, the Ottoman government has cabled back early this morning that they will refrain from further intervening in the Assyrian matter, all but officially granting them their independence. Even though they refuse to recognise the Assyrians, maintaining that Basra Vilayet remains in its entirety part of the Ottoman Empire, in practice, the Turks will no longer interfere in Basra."
ass.10.a:0 "A joyous day for all!"

ass.11.t:0 "[CAN.GetName] Opens Negotiations Concerning Assyria"
ass.11.d:0 "In continuation of their age-old policy of meddling in the business of other nations, the British ambassador has called on the Ottoman government to discuss a peaceful resolution to the Assyrian debacle.\n\nProposing a semi-independent state within the Ottoman Empire, they ask for the Assyrians to be ruled by their own parliament, train and operate their own security forces, and manage policy within Basra whilst remaining, for all other affairs, a province of the Ottoman Empire."
ass.11.a:0 "We refuse their terms!"
ass.11.b:0 "We will accept this offer."

ass.12.t:0 "[OTT.GetName] Accepts Our Proposition"
ass.12.d:0 "Agreeing with our proposal, the Ottoman Army has called an end to hostilities with the Assyrian rebels. Granting them the right to create their own parliament and maintain their own security forces, the Porte has conceded to most of their demands save full independence."
ass.12.a:0 "Another peaceful resolution!"

ass.13.t:0 "[OTT.GetName] refuses our proposition"
ass.13.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Sublime Porte has refused our proposition and has increased its operations in Basra in an attempt to bring a quick and decisive end to the Assyrian revolt. As the situation continues to worsen for the Assyrian Levies, some have called for direct military intervention to both ensure protection of the Assyrian people and secure the vast oil deposits of Iraq."
ass.13.a:0 "We should refrain from intervening."
ass.13.b:0 "Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!"

ass.14.t:0 "[CAN.GetName] Refuses to Intervene on Our Behalf"
ass.14.d:0 "Ignoring pleas from the Patriarch himself, the government in Ottawa has notified Basra "that conflict with the Turkish government is not desired" and as such will refrain from intervening in the conflict in any shape or form."
ass.14.a:0 "We are doomed..."

# Peace Events
ass.15.t:0 "Assyria proclaims victory in Iraq"
ass.15.d:0 "Beating back the Turkish forces against all possible odds, the Assyrian Levies have won their war of independence and proclaimed their full authority over Iraq."
ass.15.a:0 "Accept their demands."
ass.15.b:0 "We shall never give in!"

ass.16.t:0 "Victory in the Levant!"
ass.16.d:0 "The Ottoman forces are in full retreat as the brave sons of Assyria hold steadfast against nigh insurmountable odds. Victory is ours and so are its spoils!"
ass.16.a:0 "Basra will be the new Assyria!"

ass.17.t:0 "Victory in the Levant!"
ass.17.d:0 "The Ottoman forces are in full retreat as the brave sons of Assyria break through the walls of Baghdad. Victory is ours and so are its spoils!"
ass.17.a:0 "From Mosul to Basra the Assyrian nation stretches!"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ODISHO_MOSHE_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1919\nOdisho Moshe rose to command by merely being the right man, at the right time. Only being a mere Rab Khamshi (Sergeant), he was able to rally the Assyrian Tribesmen, who are scattered within the Mesopotamian region. His early life had him defending his Karkas, to then join the Assyrian Levies and was seen as a natural leader. Furthermore, he appears to have no interest in politics, which to many other Assyrian Officers is a further blessing..."

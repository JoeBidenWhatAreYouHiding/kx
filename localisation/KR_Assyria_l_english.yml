### Ideas ###
ASY_Technical_Illiteracy:0 "Technical Illiteracy"
ASY_Technical_Illiteracy_desc:0 "A population of agrarian and tribal descent, one of the main issues plaguing the Basra project is the lack of skilled personnel as forced and voluntary exclusion from the Ottoman educational system has greatly hampered the capabilities of our people. Whilst there is no lack of Assyrians with a clerical education, we severely lack engineers, scientists and educators."
ASY_Poor_Land_Use:0 "Crippling Poverty"
ASY_Poor_Land_Use_desc:0 "An unfair and theocratic land system has only accentuated the crippling poverty that has come to represent the Assyrians in Basra. Forced to live in shanty towns, struggling settlements in the marshes of the Lower Euphrates or in the shadow of their richer Muslim and Jewish neighbours, the war for independence has given rise to calls for a redistribution of wealth. Great differences in wealth and status between the Arabic Christians, integrated in the Ottoman system, and the adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East only further complicate the issue and have brought division into an already struggling community."
ASY_Church_Monopoly:0 "Patriarchal Dictatorship"
ASY_Church_Monopoly_desc:0 "Venerated as a Saint by his people, the patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East has developed a union of church and state over the years wherein he and his inner circle, mostly consisting of family members, have governed and represented the Assyrian people as kings. This situation, of which Mar Shimun has grown rather fond, has obstructed other political formations and given rise to a sizeable anti-patriarchal front that desires equal representation."
ASY_Ethno_Religious_Divide:0 "Ethnic-Religious Divide"
ASY_Ethno_Religious_Divide_desc:0 "The lower Mesopotamian plain has for centuries been the home of the Arab Shiites and various small splinter movements of the Abrahamic faiths. The arrival of the Assyrians in this previously muslim dominated land has greatly upset the balance of power and their push for a Christian state in the Levant has excluded large portions of the native population. The Muslim population, desiring unification with Baghdad and their religious freedom guaranteed, has become a thorn in the side of the Assyrian government as their protests, obstructionism and even guerilla warfare in the marshes of Lower Mesopotamia continue to harass our goals."

### Decisions ####
ASY_land_reclamation_decisions:0 "Land Reclamation Programme"
ASY_land_reclamation_decisions_desc:0 "Driven from our fertile lands on the Plain of Nineveh, life has been rough for the Assyrian émigrés. An inhospitable, disease ridden and difficult swamp has become our new home as the marshes of the Lower Euphrates and Tigris became the destination of large scale resettlement operations at the tail end of the Weltkrieg. Over the years as our people grew used to their new surroundings, we carved out farmland, pastures and towns with our 'Karkas' (following the Zionist example of walled settlements) becoming the centrepiece of a large-scale land reclamation campaign. Although the going is tough and frequent conflicts with the original inhabitants of the Basra region such as the Marsh Arabs and Shi'ite tribes occur, we are well underway towards establishing a new Assyria."

### Focuses
assyria_focus:0 "Assyria Focus Tree"

ASS_Declaration_Independence:0 "Assyrian Declaration of Independence"
ASS_Declaration_Independence_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire has once again shown its true face. Having slaughtered our people and banished us to Basra, they now seek to erase the last vestiges of our autonomy, taking away our only defense against the raids that endanger our very lives. For all our suffering at the hands of Constantinople, it is clear now that only one choice remains: Assyria must be free."
ASS_Fortify_Tigris:0 "Fortify the Tigris Positions"
ASS_Fortify_Tigris_desc:0 "The great Tigris river provides the only natural defense preventing the Ottomans from marching on Basra, one of the few advantages we have in our struggle. The future of our people rests on our ability to hold this vital barrier, therefore every effort must be made to do so."
ASS_End_Tribal_Divide:0 "Propose an End to Tribal Divide"
ASS_End_Tribal_Divide_desc:0 "The disparate tribes of Assyria have never known a more grave danger than this. Whatever our disputes may have been in the past, in this, Assyria's greatest hour of need, there can be no division between us. We must stand together, or we shall die alone."
ASS_Expand_Assyrian_Levies:0 "Expand the Assyrian Levies"
ASS_Expand_Assyrian_Levies_desc:0 "The levies that have protected us from the incursions of the Ma'dān have now been called upon to defend us from the Turks, but they are simply not enough. If we are to survive, then the levies must be expanded to include every able-bodied Assyrian man that we can muster. We can afford nothing less."
ASS_Appeal_Foreign_Missions:0 "Appeal to Foreign Missions"
ASS_Appeal_Foreign_Missions_desc:0 "The reprehensible actions of the Ottoman Empire during the Weltkrieg have won them few friends. The plight of the Armenians saw the opinion of much of the world turn against the Turks, and our survival may depend on our ability to cause this to repeat. We must work to persuade foreign governments of the justness of our cause, and encourage them to put pressure on the Porte."
ASS_Appeal_Holy_See:0 "Appeal to the Holy See"
ASS_Appeal_Holy_See_desc:0 "Our lands are home to many Christians of many creeds, and we count among our number a sizeable contingent of Catholics. The temporal power of the Holy See may not be what it once was, but the international Catholic community remains large, and the word of His Holiness may further undermine the Ottoman position. All we must do is reach out."
ASS_Avenge_Raqa_Raqa:0 "Avenge the 'Raqa Raqa'"
ASS_Avenge_Raqa_Raqa_desc:0 "We remember the days of the Raqa Raqa, "the Flight", when countless Assyrians were expelled from their homes at the hands of the Turks. It is thanks to them that we were forced to make new start in the lands behind the British lines, in the lands surrounding Basra. The wounds of these dark days run deep in many an Assyrian, and we have neither forgotten what the Turks did to us, nor forgiven."
ASS_Last_Stand_Assur:0 "The Last Stand of Assur"
ASS_Last_Stand_Assur_desc:0 "This may very well be the final stand of the Assyrian people. If we do not succeed here, we may never get another chance at our independence, and a future as subjects of the Ottomans looks grim. The ancient land of Assur is to finally control its own destiny again, we must not fail in our duty. And if we do, it certainly won't be for a lack of trying."

ASS_New_Assur:0 "Assyria Rising"
ASS_New_Assur_desc:0 "After all the trials and tribulations the Assyrian people have endured, we have finally won our right to a homeland, a nation to call our own, where we may live by our own laws and decide our own destiny. We stand at the precipice of a beautiful new era, but we have much work ahead of us if we are to become a truly stable and prosperous nation. We must move at once to secure the future of our young state."
ASS_Standardise_Language:0 "Standardise the Assyrian Language"
ASS_Standardise_Language_desc:0 "The Assyrian language is spoken in many different ways by many different people, a reality that looms large over any aspirations for national unity. The nations of the world have gone to great lengths to ensure that a common language unites their citizens, and if Assyria is to last then she must follow suit. A body must be created to standardize the Assyrian language and ensure its uniform use."
ASS_Directorate_Education:0 "Found the Directorate for Education"
ASS_Directorate_Education_desc:0 "Among the many difficulties our young nation faces is an endemic lack of literacy that greatly hampers our development. It is crucial that we work to provide schooling to our people and vigorously fight illiteracy among our populace, so that they may grow into proud citizens and form the basis of a skilled labour pool that will drive our nation's growth."
ASS_Unitas_in_Diversitate:0 "Unitas in Diversitate"
ASS_Unitas_in_Diversitate_desc:0 "The state that the Assyrians have strived to create has been an exclusively Christian one, but the fact of the matter is that the borders of Assyria include numerous people who do not identify with our cause. The animosity between us will not be healed overnight, but we must endeavor regardless to prove ourselves as just rulers who will not infringe on the rights of Muslims or any other faiths."
ASS_Basra_University:0 "Open the University of Basra"
ASS_Basra_University_desc:0 "The crowning achievement of our newly established Directorate for Education, the University of Basra is to be the highest place of learning in all of Assyria. The brightest minds that our nation has to offer shall gather here to become the foundation of a new generation of Assyrian technicians and scientists, and help build a new tradition of Assyrian culture."
ASS_Implement_Racial_Segregation:0 "Implement Racial Segregation"
ASS_Implement_Racial_Segregation_desc:0 "Our new homeland for the Assyrians has been met with resistance since its inception. The Muslims within our borders have made no secret of their opposition to our cause, constantly obstructing our government and even pushing for the end of our state. If our nation is to survive this, we must move to preserve the undiluted will of the Assyrians, free from those who would see us destroyed."
ASS_Cultural_Revolution:0 "Advance the Cultural Revolution"
ASS_Cultural_Revolution_desc:0 "Ours is a nation under siege. With each day that passes, stability in the region and the world erodes bit by bit, and only a fool would believe that Assyria will be spared the coming storm. The salvation of the Assyrian nation must be a cultural revolution: an aggressive campaign to promote faith in the nation and sacrifice for her safety. Every man must do his part."
ASS_Assyro_Iraqi_Exchange:0 "The Assyro-Iraqi Population Exchange"
ASS_Assyro_Iraqi_Exchange_desc:0 "Despite our triumph against the Ottoman yoke, Assyrians remain beyond our borders, where our establishment of a Christian state in the Levant has opened them up to suspicion from the local Muslim populace. We wish for our brothers and sisters to come home, and the Iraqis wish for them to leave...perhaps an agreement can be reached between us."
ASS_Expand_Bureau_Resettlement:0 "Expand the Bureau for Resettlement"
ASS_Expand_Bureau_Resettlement_desc:0 "While the good work of the Bureau of Resettlement thus far has certainly been appreciated, the flow of new immigrants to the new Assyrian state requires more from us. The influx of new Assyrians from Iraq and beyond have placed significant strain on the existing infrastructure, making clear the necessity of an expansion of the Bureau."
ASS_Maintain_State_of_Emergency:0 "Maintain the State of Emergency"
ASS_Maintain_State_of_Emergency_desc:0 "Unfortunately, our great victory against the Turks has done little to change the fact that our newborn state is beset with enemies on all sides. Our future still sits on the edge of a knife, and it would be foolish to pretend that we can afford to drop our guard while we are still vulnerable. Our wise Patriarch has deemed it necessary to keep a state of emergency for the foreseeable future, for the safety of us all."
ASS_Rally_Faithful:0 "Rally the Faithful"
ASS_Rally_Faithful_desc:0 "It is for the safety and security of the Assyrian nation that all able-bodied Christian men must be prepared to take up arms in her defense, a necessary duty in a land as endangered as ours. In the next war, we will once again be fighting to protect our hard-won independence, where the difference between life and death will be the ability of the children of God to answer the call. The Patriarch has proclaimed it so."
ASS_Institute_Intelligence:0 "Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations"
ASS_Institute_Intelligence_desc:0 "Our military is small, as such, we cannot afford to go into great battles against our enemies for dominance. To counter this, a new school has been opened at our military headquarters to train new officers in modern forms of small unit combat and intelligence gathering work. With these skills, our military may be able to combat larger threats."
ASS_Centralise_Religious_Authority:0 "Centralise Religious Authority"
ASS_Centralise_Religious_Authority_desc:0 "The myriad Christians of Assyria have long lacked a strong religious figure to guide them and bind them into one community. As the father of our nation, the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East has seen it fit to take sole responsibility for the spiritual well-being of all Assyrian Christians, so that we may be united against our enemies."
ASS_Codify_Unification_Church_State:0 "Codify the Unification of Church and State"
ASS_Codify_Unification_Church_State_desc:0 "Nobody can dispute that the most defining trait of the Assyrian people is their Christian faith, and that the quest for an Assyrian homeland has been one of founding a Christian state. As the state is the embodiment and representative of the Assyrian people, there is no need for a secular state. In a truly Assyrian homeland, faith and state must be bound."
ASS_Kingdom_New_Assur:0 "The Kingdom of New Assur"
ASS_Kingdom_New_Assur_desc:0 "The splendor of our Patriarch, Mar Ehsai XII Shimun, truly knows no bounds. Under his guidance Assyria has become a free and prosperous nation, delivering us from our darkest days and into a glorious new golden age. His eyes have now opened to a beautiful new future: a New Assur to rival the Assyrian empires of old, spreading along Mesopotamia from Basra to Kirkuk... all under the glory of our new King."
ASS_Abolish_Kuwait:0 "Abolish the Shaykhdom of Kuwait"
ASS_Abolish_Kuwait_desc:0 "The Shaykhdom of Kuwait, once a British protectorate that had lapsed with the British Revolution and their subsequent withdrawal from the Persian Gulf, continues to exist within our borders as a historical relic and obstacle to our government. We can no longer tolerate this parallel authority within our lands: The time has come for Kuwait to submit to the new Assyrian state."

ASS_Consecrate_Bishoprics_desc:0 "The relatively recent arrival of a large number of Christians in the area that now constitutes Assyria has meant that there simply aren't enough clergy to meet their spiritual needs. Our new role as a homeland for Christians in the Levant obligates us to oversee the establishment of new bishoprics, so that all Assyrians may have shepherds to tend to them."
ASS_Cathedral_St_Hurmzid:0 "The Cathedral of St. Hurmizd"
ASS_Cathedral_St_Hurmzid_desc:0 "The Cathedral of St. Hurzmid is to be the first Assyrian church in our new nation, and is intended to be the highest house of worship in Nestorian Christianity, playing host to the Patriarch himself. Its construction will be a very large prestige project and an important step in reversing the gloomy mentality that has set in among our people since our flight to Basra."
ASS_Denounce_Schiasmatics:0 "Denounce the Schismatics"
ASS_Denounce_Schiasmatics_desc:0 "Our great and magnificent Patriarch, in all his wisdom, has decreed that the followers of Christ cannot stand divided in the face of those who would oppose us. The schismatics who defy our Patriarch's righteous guidance and divide us further do not act in the interests of the Assyrian nation, and must be brought to heel."
ASS_Mend_Schism:0 "Mend the Great Schism"
ASS_Mend_Schism_desc:0 "The Nestorian and Chaldean spiritual leadership has decided that the followers of Christ cannot stand divided in the face of those who would oppose us. Assyria's survival hinges on the unity of the churches and the fraternity of all the children of God, no matter their creed. It is time for us to put our differences aside and greet each other as brothers and sisters."
ASS_Embrace_Sons_Assur:0 "Embrace the Lost Sons of Assur"
ASS_Embrace_Sons_Assur_desc:0 "The Assyrian people have been scattered to the wind like leaves, a stateless people, cast adrift to look for new homes abroad. With the establishment of an Assyrian state, these lost sons may finally return to where they will finally have a nation to call their own. After generations of pain at the hands of the Turks, we welcome them home with open arms." 
ASS_Relinquish_Temporal_Power:0 "Relinquish Temporal Power"
ASS_Relinquish_Temporal_Power_desc:0 "Having led our people to safety in their time of need, Patriarch Shimun and representatives from the other religious groups of Assyria have agreed that the state of emergency can now be lifted, and a more permanent and responsible government be allowed to form. A convention shall be called at the earliest convenience to write a constitution for the basis of a democratic government."
ASS_Proclaim_Assyrian_Constitution:0 "Proclaim the Assyrian Constitution"
ASS_Proclaim_Assyrian_Constitution_desc:0 "After a great deal of discussion, debate, dialogue, and discourse (and at least one thrown shoe), the constitutional convention has finally managed to produce a working document. The Assyrian constitution places the Patriarch as a ceremonial head of state while also asserting parliamentary supremacy over government, and legally enshrines religious pluralism as a guiding principle of society."
ASS_Encourage_Religious_Dialogue:0 "Encourage Religious Dialogue"
ASS_Encourage_Religious_Dialogue_desc:0 "The foundation of a healthy democracy is a tradition of political dialogue, but in the unique political landscape that has formed in Assyria there is often a great deal of overlap between one's political affiliation and their religious one. As such, it is just as important that we work to open the theological sphere as much as the political one."
ASS_Assyrian_Parliament:0 "Open the Assyrian Parliament"
ASS_Assyrian_Parliament_desc:0 "In accordance with his declared intent to relinquish emergency powers, the Patriarch has seen that a Parliament be established and elections held at the soonest convenience. Once an elected body is established, a government can  be formed and the dictatorial powers that the Patriarch has wielded since the declaration of independence may finally be put to rest, to the relief of many a malcontent."
ASS_Freedom_Press:0 "Ensure the Freedom of Press"
ASS_Freedom_Press_desc:0 "A free and prosperous media has always been a hallmark of the most developed nations. If we are to catch up with our neighbors and prove we are mighty enough to stand on the world stage with them, we must make strides to increase our influence on the global news sector. A free press will further these goals greatly."
ASS_Assyrian_Petro_Union:0 "Found the Assyrian Petrochemical Union"
ASS_Assyrian_Petro_Union_desc:0 "To stimulate the nascent Assyrian economy, the government has decided it necessary to establish a state-owned company for exploiting Assyria's crude oil deposits, a market that is becoming increasingly lucrative as the world arms itself for war. The profits from these oil ventures will hopefully fund government projects aimed at addressing the numerous issues facing Assyrian society."
ASS_Labour_Laws:0 "Ratify Labour Laws"
ASS_Labour_Laws_desc:0 "The oil industry is far from a pretty place to work, and the current mordibund state of labour legislation has given rise to a number of legal loopholes allowing for poor working conditions to become the norm. This has already given rise to a young labor movement calling for a tightening of legal protections for workers, and many members of parliament agree that some degree of reform is called for."
ASS_Reform_Bureaucracy:0 "Reform the Assyrian Bureaucracy"
ASS_Reform_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "As the state matures, it has become increasingly and painfully obvious that the thus-far unstandardized and disorganized nature of the Assyrian bureaucracy is simply unacceptable. In much of the land exists a great deal of confusion as it is unclear which offices are responsible for what areas, creating a great deal of dysfunction across the government. A comprehensive review is needed."

ASS_Frontline_Imperialism:0 "The Frontline of Imperialism"
ASS_Frontline_Imperialism_desc:0 "Turks, Arabs, and Persians alike all decry the evils of British imperialism...but the Assyrian people have never known a more true friend than the British Empire. Our only ally in the Weltkrieg, it was thanks to them that an autonomous region for our people was established, which now serves as our homeland. It is in the best interests of Assyria that we embrace and deepen the ties that bind the two of us together."
ASS_Restore_Persian_Gulf_Protectorates:0 "Restore the Persian Gulf Protectorates"
ASS_Restore_Persian_Gulf_Protectorates_desc:0 "The British Empire once maintained protectorates along the coast of the Persian Gulf, these lands being lost to the Ottomans after the government's flight to Canada. However, with the Empire having restored a regional foothold in Assyria, the Gulf's strategic situation seems to have shifted in our favor. Perhaps this is the chance we've needed to restore these long lost jewels to the crown?"
ASS_Secure_Kirkuk_Oil_Fields:0 "Secure the Kirkuk Oil Fields"
ASS_Secure_Kirkuk_Oil_Fields_desc:0 "The war machines of the Entente have an insatiable hunger for oil. This so-called black gold is critical to many military production lines, and any natural deposits of it have become strategically invaluable. Assyria has some of it to provide, but the oil production in Iraq significantly overshadows our own. It has become a strategic necessity that we secure these oil fields for us and our allies."
ASS_Protectorate_Assyria:0 "Establish the Protectorate of Assyria"
ASS_Protectorate_Assyria_desc:0 "After a great deal of discussion between the Patriarch the British government-in-exile in Ottawa, an agreement has finally been reached to establish a Protectorate of Assyria so that the British may more directly aid in the development of our young nation. An Imperial Economic Development Council commission will assume responsibility for most of Assyria's day-to-day affairs, so that our fledgling state is carefully and responsibly governed."
ASS_IEDC:0 "IEDC Development Program"
ASS_IEDC_desc:0 "The Imperial Economic Development Council has wasted no time in drawing up a detailed development plan to foster the underdeveloped Assyrian economy, with a particular focus on investments and importing technical specialists from elsewhere in the Entente to mitigate the, frankly, dismal state of Assyrian skilled labour. The plan shows great promise, and should hopefully provide a much needed shot in the arm to our economic development."
ASS_Anglican_Missions:0 "Expand Missionary Work of the Catholic Church"
ASS_Anglican_Missions_desc:0 "The Catholic Church has a very long history of sending missionaries abroad to spread the faith and aid the needy, and Assyria has no shortage of the latter. Calling upon and expanding the Assyrian network of missionaries will no doubt aid our government, reassure the local Catholic community, and provide a counterweight to the Patriarch's authority... though the other religious groups may not be as thrilled."
ASS_Smash_The_Patriarchy:0 "Curb Patriarchal Power"
ASS_Smash_The_Patriarchy_desc:0 "The political monopoly that the Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East possesses has proven to be more of a liability than anything else. Despite his broad popularity with Nestorians, the other Christian sects within Assyria have come to feel left behind and his autocratic government has created a sizeable, and frustrating, opposition bloc. He must be made to know his place."
ASS_Indian_Bureaucracy:0 "Import the Indian Bureaucracy"
ASS_Indian_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Between the investments that the IEDC has been funneling into Assyria and the needs of a small nation, the rather shoddy administration we have inherited simply won't do the job. The administrators of British India have a reputation for their efficiency, a trait that will prove very useful in establishing a new colonial bureaucracy."
ASS_Tibal_Civil_Criminal_Disputes_Regulation:0 "Tribal Civil & Criminal Disputes Regulation"
ASS_Tibal_Civil_Criminal_Disputes_Regulation_desc:0 "Assyria is host to numerous tribes, coming together to form a mind-bending web of intertribal relations and disputes, disputes that can turn violent if not resolved properly and justly. Regulations and legal circuits concerning these disputes and their mediation must be established with all due haste."
ASS_Paramount_Chiefs:0 "Appoint the Paramount Chiefs"
ASS_Paramount_Chiefs_desc:0 "Our experiences in ruling ethnically diverse regions has led to some working models. Particularly interesting is the system of Paramount Chiefs that has seen use in South Africa's High Commissioner Territories, where autonomous rulers for each ethnic group are appointed to ensure these groups' loyalty. There are certainly aspects of this system that may translate well to Assyria's diverse ethnic situation."
ASS_Farm_City_Connections:0 "Expand Farm-to-City Connections"
ASS_Farm_City_Connections_desc:0 "The state of Assyrian infrastructure is...lacking. The marshes of Lower Mesopotamia are generally poor for most roads, and a lack of funds or interest from the Ottomans outside of the port has done little to remedy this. Roads and rails are necessary for industry, and if the IEDC program is to bear fruit, ways must be found to efficiently bring rural produce to Basra for processing."

ASS_Resettlement_Immigration_Bureau:0 "Bureau for Immigration and Resettlement"
ASS_Resettlement_Immigration_Bureau_desc:0 "There are many immigrants to our lands, and many refugees both domestically and beyond. This new bureau shall see to their needs, and get our people settled, productive, and most importantly taxable as soon as possible."
ASS_Industrial_Bank_Basra:0 "Establish the Industrial Bank of Basra"
ASS_Industrial_Bank_Basra_desc:0 "No new industries can be established without a source of capital, and the young Assyrian economy needs a large injection of it. The first step to the industrialization of Assyria is the establishment of a bank to provide low-interest loans to aspiring industrial projects."
ASS_Basra_Dominion_Cartridge:0 "Basra Dominion Cartridge Co."
ASS_Basra_Dominion_Cartridge_desc:0 "Assyria's new status as a beneficiary of the British Empire's patronage has opened up some new opportunities for joint ventures. Entrepreneurs from across the dominions have proposed the creation of a colonial arms company to help expand the local economy and aid the protectorate's armament."
ASS_Local_Production:0 "Encourage Local Production"
ASS_Local_Production_desc:0 "The state of the Assyrian economy is best described as infantile. A significant portion of the population are subsistence farmers, and the local economy has historically been oriented around a greater Ottoman system and isn't adapting well outside of it. A scheme of subsidies and strategic tariffs can help develop local production."
ASS_Land_Reclamation:0 "The Land Reclamation Commission"
ASS_Land_Reclamation_desc:0 "Large stretches of Lower Mesopotamia are prone to regular flooding or are perpetually waterlogged, a fact that creates much fertile land but just as much marshland, unsuitable for agriculture. With a flow of immigrants expected, a commission must be established to reclaim these marshes and expand our pool of arable land."
ASS_Madan_Land_Seizures:0 "Ma'dan Land Seizures"
ASS_Madan_Land_Seizures_desc:0 "The demands of economic expansion and the constant flow of new immigrants has necessitated more drastic action. Despite our victory, the Ma'dan, or Marsh Arabs, continue to persist and launch raids on our settlements, and were known to shelter criminals even before our independence. Between all of these things, we have enough legal justification to appropriate their land for better use."
ASS_Establish_Agricultural_Bank:0 "The Agricultural Bank of Assyria"
ASS_Establish_Agricultural_Bank_desc:0 "Most farmers in Assyria do not sell much of their produce, generally only growing enough to feed themselves and their dependents with the primitive tools they have access to. Following the model of the successful Industrial Bank, we should establish a bank for providing loans to finance new and more efficient farming equipment."
ASS_Livestock_Program:0 "Program for the Import of Sheep & Cows"
ASS_Livestock_Program_desc:0 "Years of strife and war in the Assyrian lands has taken its toll on our pool of livestock, drained by Ma'dan raids and Ottoman incursions. Assyria is decently suited for the raising of sheep and cattle, so we should implement a program for importing livestock so that we may replenish our reserves."
ASS_Cash_Crop_Diversification:0 "Cash Crop Diversification"
ASS_Cash_Crop_Diversification_desc:0 "Our economy is currently based on a select few resources, one of which being our agriculture. To further economic development, we must diversify what raw materials our farms produce."
ASS_Eucalyptus_Forestry:0 "Eucalyptus Forestry Program"
ASS_Eucalyptus_Forestry_desc:0 "The warm climate of Assyria is well suited for the cultivation of the eucalyptus tree, native to Australia and southeast Asia but grown widely as a fast-growing source of pulpwood and useful oils. The tree has all the makings of a lucrative cash crop for the impoverished nation of Assyria, one we would do well to exploit."
ASS_Commence_Mechanisation:0 "Commence Agricultural Mechanisation"
ASS_Commence_Mechanisation_desc:0 "Like most of our nation, the Assyrian agricultural sector is extremely underdeveloped as we still use ancient techniques to plow the ground and grow our crops. The great reforms in our society currently ongoing must stretch to all corners of the land, and with such a heavy reliance on our farmers, we must supply them with the best materials possible."
ASS_Modernise_Port_Kuwait:0 "Modernise the Port of Kuwait"
ASS_Modernise_Port_Kuwait_desc:0 "To promote the free trade of materials both in and outbound of the Persian Gulf, it is vital that the Port of Kuwait be capable of handling more modern vessels. Increasing our dockyard capabilities as well as improving the infrastructure of our ports is of the utmost importance."
ASS_Burgan_Oil:0 "Exploit the Burgan Oil Field"
ASS_Burgan_Oil_desc:0 "Oil is debatably the most important material on earth, and with our abundance of it, we must expand our facilities on the fields to further increase our impact on the world market. Burgan is home to massive supplies of oil, yet it is currently underdeveloped. We must move quickly to secure these assets."
ASS_Magwa_Oil:0 "Exploit the Magwa Oil Field"
ASS_Magwa_Oil_desc:0 "The operations in Burgan's oil fields have been a massive success for our economy. In the hopes of gaining even more, further exploitation of the Magwa Oil Field is now possible with the money we've gained from the Burgan field. Oil is the future, and we must get on now."

ASS_Reform_Assyrian_Levies:0 "Reform the Assyrian Levies"
ASS_Reform_Assyrian_Levies_desc:0 "The levies that have defended our homes from Ma'dan raids and so bravely won our independence have served their purpose up to now, but simply won't suffice without reforms. As a newly independent state, our military needs have greatly expanded beyond a settlement defense force, necessitating that these levies are shaped from their current state to a proper professionalized fighting force."
ASS_Assyrian_Coast_Guard:0 "Form the Assyrian Coast Guard"
ASS_Assyrian_Coast_Guard_desc:0 "With the advent of the dreadnought in the Weltkrieg, the navies of the world have seen incredible change. In order to stay competitive, developing a Coast Guard to protect our coastal waters and administrate our ports has been found to be the best solution, as we cannot afford a true blue-water fleet."
ASS_Enfield_Ontario_Contract:0 "The Enfield-Ontario Rifle Contract"
ASS_Enfield_Ontario_Contract_desc:0 "We have long suffered from an industry incapable of producing the weapons of war needed to ensure our sovereignty. In a bid to remedy this situation, the British have agreed to supply us with rifles in exchange for further cooperation with the Entente."
ASS_Standardise_Rifles:0 "Standardisation of Rifles"
ASS_Standardise_Rifles_desc:0 "Our military has been in a state of disorganization since its inception. In the hopes of regimenting our military from the ground up, we must develop a universal standard for our weaponry should we wish to fight in this new modern world."
ASS_NCO_Training:0 "NCO Training"
ASS_NCO_Training_desc:0 "The Non-Commissioned Officer is the backbone of any modern military. The bridge between our enlisted men and the officers which command them, we must make certain our NCO Corps is capable of not only being this bridge, but that it is also strong enough to carry any weight which may attempt and cross them."
ASS_Wireless:0 "Integrate Radio Communication"
ASS_Wireless_desc:0 "The advent of radio has made the transmission of information almost instant. If our military is to hold an upper hand against our larger and stronger adversaries we must have a well organized command structure that allows for us to react to issues as they come up. The radio grants us this ability, as such, we must provide all units with sufficient radios and training to use them."
ASS_Modern_Markawta:0 "The Modern Markawta"
ASS_Modern_Markawta_desc:0 "The face of warfare is changing before our very eyes: the endless march of technology has yielded new markawta, or vehicles, that bear armor and guns of their own, all while moving much faster than a soldier on foot. Military theorists from home and abroad predict that these vehicles will play a decisive role in modern warfare, and that it would be foolish not to incorporate them into our strategies."
ASS_Assyrian_Army:0 "Establish the Assyrian Army"
ASS_Assyrian_Army_desc:0 "Disorganized militias are no way to organize the protection of a nation. While we are eternally grateful to our vast supply of volunteer soldiers, we must develop a professional army should we wish to stand a chance against the coming storm."
ASS_RAF_Shaibah:0 "Establish RAF Shaibah"
ASS_RAF_Shaibah_desc:0 "In order to ensure that our people and our land are protected from the Ottoman menace, the British have agreed to construct a base for the Royal Air Force within our borders to act as a deterrent, and to further expand the Entente's influence in the region."
ASS_Signaller_Corp:0 "Signaler Corps"
ASS_Signaller_Corp_desc:0 "In the pursuit of further military modernization, it has been deemed necessary to form schools to begin training our own professional Signal Corps. This corps will be focused on the management of information to and from the battlefield to further coordinate our regiments. This will be a vital organ in our military in the wars to come."
ASS_Middle_Eastern_Listening_Post:0 "Middle Eastern Listening Post"
ASS_Middle_Eastern_Listening_Post_desc:0 "With our increasing experience in the use of radio communication, a group of ambitious young officers have approached command with an idea they have heard is used in militaries abroad; a discreet listening post fitted with advanced radio communications facilities to stalk enemy radio communications. Our commanders only had one question. "Where should we start construction?""
ASS_Mandatory_Conscription:0 "Enact Mandatory Conscription"
ASS_Mandatory_Conscription_desc:0 "The war for the soul of our people is upon us, and all sons of Assyria must be called upon in this sacred act. Our current military forces are not nearly enough to hold our territory, and while volunteers are flooding in, we must look to expand our conscription requirements to defend our home."
 
### Events
ass.1.t:0 "Ma'dān Shelter Criminals"
ass.1.d:0 "The Ma'dān, or Marsh Arabs, who inhabit the marshes near the city of Basra have long been a thorn in the side of central authority in the region just as their marshland home has been all but terra incognita for the Ottoman administration. Explorers who venture into their lands never return, and the Ma'dān who cooperate with outside authorities often find themselves severely punished by their local leaders in retaliation. The inhospitable nature of their marshes has, up until now, mostly ensured their autonomy, and their political apathy towards the Ottoman regime has kept them off the radar.\n\nRecent Assyrian damming and settlement projects made in an effort to develop new agricultural land and to flush out the Shiite resistance fighting the Assyrian settlers have forced them to take a more active stance; now, the Marsh Arabs are not only sheltering fugitives from Assyrian operations but also those of the Baghdadi Wali. The latter, angered by this development, has requested reinforcements from Konstantiniyye to bring them in line and impose both taxes and conscription for the Ottoman army."
ass.1.a:0 "Leave them be."
ass.1.b:0 "Accept his request."

ass.2.t:0 "Massacre in Al-Qurnah"
ass.2.d:0 "The site of the now-famous Battle of Al-Qurnah during the initial phase of the Mesopotamian Campaign of the Weltkrieg, the eponymous city of Al-Qurnah became home to a large community of Assyrian refugees and settlers following the war. While relations between the Assyrian settlers and the local (predominantly Ma'dān Arab) population have never been warm, tensions escalated earlier this week as thirty Assyrian settlers were massacred in a raid on their quarter with the destruction of fifty more homes. The Assyrian local government has already declared the action a deed of extreme barbary and, in addition to demanding support from the Ottoman Army to push the Ma'dān further into the marshes, has called up its own local militia forces, the Assyrian Levies, who have largely assumed peacekeeping and policing duties in the British-controlled regions of Basra Vilayet."
ass.2.a:0 "Send a detachment from Baghdad."
ass.2.b:0 "Order the Assyrian Levies to stand down."

ass.3.t:0 "Assyrian Levies Exact Revenge for Al-Qurnah"
ass.3.d:0 "In retaliation for the murder of Assyrians and the destruction of their property, the Assyrian local government has sent out the Assyrian Levies to exact revenge on the Ma'dān. Burning down multiple villages and driving the Marsh Arabs further into the swamps and marshes of Southern Mesopotamia, their actions show a clear intent to forcefully dislocate the native population in order to acquire more fertile land.\n\nThe Wali in Basra has requested confirmation from the government to disband the Assyrian Levies, as he fears that further actions could lead to a massacre rivaling the Lebanese Civil War, which took place only a few decades ago. However, he also sees in this challenge an opportunity to weaken the autonomy of the Assyrians and hasten their full integration into the new Ottoman society."
ass.3.a:0 "Disband the Levies!"
ass.3.b:0 "Leave them be."

ass.4.t:0 "Shimun XXI Eshai Pleads for the Preservation of the Assyrian Levies"
ass.4.d:0 "The Patriarch of Babylon and de-facto leader of the Assyrian community, Shimun XXI Eshai, has pleaded for permission to maintain the Assyrian Levies. Without them, he says, his people are fully left to the mercy of Muslim gendarmerie forces and have no way to prevent the Marsh Arabs from murdering more Assyrians."
ass.4.a:0 "Nonsense! The Ottoman Gendarmerie protects all, regardless of religion."
ass.4.b:0 "Allow them to maintain the Levies."

ass.5.t:0 "Assyrian Government Refuses Demands"
ass.5.d:0 "Continuing to maintain that the Levies are the only thing between life and death for the Assyrian people, Rab Khaila Dawid d’Mar Shimun has rescinded the order from the Wali in Basra and has mobilised his troops. Backed by the Church of the East, Shimun has declared Basra an autonomous region within the empire and has demanded immediate withdrawal of the Wali's forces from the region, self-government for the Assyrian people, the right to collect taxes independently, and further protection of the Assyrian Church from Shiite discontent.\n\nThe Wali of Basra has, in response, mobilised the city's gendarmerie to disband the Levies, by force if necessary. However, he finds himself substantially outgunned and outnumbered within the city. In Konstantiniyye, the Grand Vizier is furious at this betrayal, and has demanded all Mesopotamian troops mobilised to put down the Assyrian insurrection before foreign intervention in their favour can occur."
ass.5.a:0 "Send in the Army!"

ass.6.t:0 "Assyrian Revolt Crushed"
ass.6.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Assyrian revolt has been crushed by our vastly superior army. Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai has ordered his government to lay down their weapons. Our sources say he was spotted embarking on an unmarked Indian vessel bound for Delhi just before the fall of Basra. With this action, no organised resistance remains in Southern Iraq, and Ottoman might is once again victorious."

ass.7.d:0 "Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East and de-facto ruler of the Assyrian State, which has just declared its independence, Shimun XXI Eshai requests assistance in the fight against the Ottoman authorities. Having served with distinction in the Mesopotamian Campaign during the Weltkrieg and as civil servants and industrialists in our economic concessions in Basra following the war, the Assyrians are our closest allies on the ground within the influence of the Porte and are used by our nationals to direct British affairs in Iraq.\n\nHowever, despite their close ties to the Entente, many in our government see this development as a premature attempt by the Assyrians to break free, both ruining their own chances of survival should they be defeated (which is very likely without our support) and compromising the fragile relation between ourselves and the Porte, which will surely react unkindly to any attempts to meddle in their internal affairs."

ass.8.t:0 "[CAN.GetName] Demands an End to Hostilities in Basra"
ass.8.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, the Canadian government has dared to directly interfere in our domestic affairs. They are demanding an immediate withdrawal of all Ottoman forces from Basra Vilayet, and calling for an end to hostilities with the newly proclaimed Assyrian state. Not only would conceding inflict immense damage on the prestige of the Porte, it would likely also give rise to increased separatism elsewhere in the empire, most notably amongst the Greeks and Arabs."

ass.11.t:0 "[CAN.GetName] Opens Negotiations Concerning Assyria"
ass.11.d:0 "In continuation of their age-old policy of meddling in the business of other nations, the British ambassador has called on the Ottoman government to discuss a peaceful resolution to the Assyrian debacle.\n\nProposing a semi-independent state within the Ottoman Empire, they ask for the Assyrians to be ruled by their own parliament, train and operate their own security forces, and manage policy within Basra whilst remaining, for all other affairs, a province of the Ottoman Empire."

ass.12.t:0 "[OTT.GetName] Accepts Our Proposition"
ass.12.d:0 "Agreeing with our proposal, the Ottoman Army has called an end to hostilities with the Assyrian rebels. Granting them the right to create their own parliament and maintain their own security forces, the Porte has conceded to most of their demands save for full independence."
ass.12.a:0 "Another peaceful resolution!"

ass.13.t:0 "[OTT.GetName] Refuses Our Proposition"
ass.13.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the Sublime Porte has refused our proposition and has increased its operations in Basra in an attempt to bring a quick and decisive end to the Assyrian revolt. As the situation continues to worsen for the Assyrian Levies, some have called for direct military intervention to both ensure protection of the Assyrian people and secure the vast oil deposits of Iraq."
ass.13.a:0 "We should refrain from intervening."

Our continuous press deeper into the swamplands, clearing and draining vast tracts of land to cleanse away disease and settle our people, has displaced and angered many Ma'dān; while some have fled further into the receding swamplands and take up arms against our forces, some now live in shantytowns or camps outside of Basra, having become dependent on the city.\n\nThe number of displaced people is approaching critical mass and Ma'dān attacks on our settlers have only become more ferocious, tying up more and more of our critical manpower, while the shanties outside Basra grow every day."

ass.20.t:0 "American Isaqta"
ass.20.d:0 "Assyrian people have lived in the United States for decades, but it was only with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg and the Assyrian genocide that they began to flee in large numbers. The United States, on the other side of the world and so reluctant to involve itself in the affairs of Eurasia, seemed like a safe bet and communities in Illinois swelled with their numbers.\n\nHowever, as the Great Depression ravaged the nation throwing many back into poverty, a few former Assyrian immigrants are looking back to Iraq, entranced by a message of unity and support pleaded by their priests."
ass.20.a:0 "All are welcome in Assyria!"

ass.21.t:0 "Russian Isaqta"
ass.21.d:0 "Assyrian people first arrived in significant numbers following the Treaty of Turkmenchay in 1828, when the border between Persia and the Russian Empire was formally drawn. A second wave arrived after the Weltkrieg, when many fled north across the Caucasus to escape the clutches of the Ottomans and the Kurds. Most settled in Krasnodar and Rostov, while some went on to Moscow after the end of the Russian Civil War. However, increasing persecution by the Russian government has led many Assyrians to dream of a new, Assyrian, home further South."
ass.21.a:0 "Welcome to the Russian Assyrians!"

ass.22.t:0 "Unruly Tribesmen"
ass.22.d:0 "Almost immediately after the withdrawal of Ottoman forces, the shaky tribal alliances that pledged themselves to the Patriarch have started to disintegrate with border guards leaving their posts, skirmishes between various tribes breaking out and general disobedience amongst their ranks.\n\nTurning their swords into ploughshares, many have simply deserted from the army to take up a life of farming in the protected settlements whilst others are taking refuge in the camps and shantytowns surrounding Basra."
ass.22.a:0 "Their lack of discipline will be our undoing..."

ass.23.t:0 "Christian Division"
ass.23.d:0 "The Assyrian Christian Democratic party is not to be thought of as a conventional political party, but is rather a conglomerate of smaller religious associations. These smaller associations can be divided into two greater groups, representing the two main faiths of the Assyrian people. One being Yousef VI Emmanuel II Thomas of the Chaldean Catholic Church, with the other being Shimun XXI Eshai, of the Church of the East.\n\nThe prestige of Mar Shimun and his firm grip over the Assyrian Levies has led to concerns amongst the Chaldeans who fear that he wishes to either absorb their church or discriminate against its members. Others are less opposed, believing that there might be room for mediation and that mending the great schism would be crucial to the survival of an Assyrian state."
ass.23.a:0 "All are united under God."

ass.24.t:0 "A Union of Communion"
ass.24.d:0 "Today, the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East issued a joint synodal declaration proclaiming that their respective adherents were to be formally allowed to take Communion together. This news is especially momentous for the Assyrians. The established Chaldean Catholic community in the new Assyrian homeland proved to be gracious hosts in offering their churches for the Assyrians to conduct their own ceremonies and rites, most notably offering the use of the Cathedral of Our Lady, the largest Christian church in the city, for use in Church of the East functions."
ass.24.a:0 "Though the Church itself has seen better days."

ass.25.t:0 "Cornerstone of the Cathedral of St. Hurmizd Laid"
ass.25.d:0 "Mar Eshai XXI Shimun, reigning patriarch of the Assyrian Church, laid the ceremonial cornerstone of the Cathedral of St. Hurmizd Laid today in Basra, in a ceremony attended by hundreds of Assyrians. The cathedral, which will be the first true Assyrian church built in their new homeland in Basra and is designed as the seat of power for the Nestorian Patriarch, is named in honour of the holy Rabban Hormizd, whose holiday is celebrated the second Sunday after Easter and is a symbol in both the Chaldean and Nestorian liturgy.\n\nAs the day went on, construction began in earnest, and crews were hard at work well into the twilight hours of the day."
ass.25.a:0 "A monument to God for his blessings."

# Foreign events
ass.26.t:0 "Assyria Wishes to Join the Entente"
ass.26.d:0 "Having only recently won their war of independence against the Ottoman Turk, the small and fledgling state of Assyria has requested our assistance and a restoration of the protection and alliance we provided to them during the Weltkrieg. Although many see them as a liability, surrounded by peoples who want their existence erased, opportunists are seeing it as an opportunity to access the oil reservoirs of the Middle East and as such supply our efforts on the Indian continent."
ass.26.a:0 "We welcome them as friends."
ass.26.b:0 "We have no need for them."

ass.27.t:0 "Offer Rebuked"
ass.27.d:0 "Just like they abandoned us after the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, so have the vile British imperialists once more turned their backs on us. Alone, inexperienced and with little financial means, the Assyrian people will have to fend for themselves in an inhospitable environment."
ass.27.a:0 "Those bastards!"

ass.30.t:0 "The Dreams of Old New Assyria"
ass.30.d:0 "Finally free of the Ottoman yoke and finally stabilized after surviving the chaotic rigors and arduous growing pains that comes with newly-won independence, our Assyrian state is now in a position to pursue our own destiny - one entirely self-serving to our own needs and ambitions. The most common idea tied to this resurgence in national ambition and Assyrian exceptionalism is to rekindle some form of the Greater Assyrian idea, perhaps even tied to a pseudo-resurrection of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, or māt Aššur, of old - though only in name of course, keeping our current government’s structure intact. Should we cave in to these ludicrous demands in order to strive towards some notion of an imperialist national agenda, marching to reclaim long-abandoned and formerly Assyrian lands in the Levant, Southern Anatolia, and across the Iraqi heartlands, or should we maintain our current course while banishing these foolish ideas for good?"
ass.30.a:0 "The Neo-Assyrian Empire shall be reborn!"
ass.30.b:0 "Pursue this Greater Assyria idea under the pink tricolor."
ass.30.c:0 "Pursue this Greater Assyria idea under the pink tricolor affixed with a bull and rider."
ass.30.e:0 "Pursue this Greater Assyria idea under our current banner."
ass.30.f:0 "Let us not be so hasty in painting a target on our backs so soon after independence."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ODISHO_MOSHE_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§L\n1919\nOdisho Moshe rose to command by merely being the right man, at the right time. Only being a mere Rab Khamshi (Sergeant), he was able to rally the Assyrian Tribesmen, who are scattered within the Mesopotamian region. His early life had him defending his Karkas, to then join the Assyrian Levies and was seen as a natural leader."

POLITICS_SHIMUN_ESHAI_XXI_DESC:0 "Born February 26th 1908 in South-Eastern Anatolia, the Catholicos Patriarch Mar Eshai Shimun XXI was first hand witness to the horrors experienced by his people. As a young boy, he was groomed as the successor to his uncle who was the then ruling patriarch but as the Weltkrieg arrived in the Middle East and the Ottoman persecutions of the Assyrian people intensified, he was forced to flee his homeland in 1919 when a returning, revanchist, Ottoman army retook the plains of Nineveh. Ordained in 1920, just 12 years old, after the death of his uncle, he was taken abroad by his family to study in England and received support from the Anglican church in his endeavours. Just 5 short years later, he once more found himself on the run as syndicalist revolutionaries overthrew the British government. Returning home to his people in Basra, he took on a leading role in negotiations with the Sublime Porte and served as the unofficial leader of the Assyrian people, although real leadership was in the hands of his father David Mar Shimun and his aunt Surma d'Mar Shimun. As he grew older and his influence over the Assyrian movement grew, further reinforced by his role as official liaison between the Ottoman government and their community per the Millet system, he more openly supported the independence movement and became part of the underground organisation HAA. Lashing out against the centralising reforms of the Ottoman government, intent on eradicating the autonomy of the Assyrian community, he became the official leader of Assyria during the war for independence, a position he is unlikely to let go."

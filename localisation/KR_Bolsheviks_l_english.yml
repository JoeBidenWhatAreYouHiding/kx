### Leader Desc ###
POLITICS_GRIGORY_ZINOVIEV_DESC:0 "Born in a wealthy family in Yelisavetgrad, Ukraine, Zinoviev, however, became a member of RSDRP and a revolutionary in 1901. Because of his actions, he had to flee to Europe where he got acquinted with Lenin and quickly arose to become one of his closest allies along with Lev Kamenev. Before the October Revolution, he criticized Lenin's idea of armed revolt and advocated for a homogeneous socialist government though. Despite critisim, he supported Lenin in many cases and he was chosen the leader of the Bolsheviks after Lenin's death. Zinoviev was one of the main organisers of the Red Terror and repressions against non-socialist opposition. In 1920, a few months before the end of the Civil War, the party has split into two. While RKP was mostly in immigration and underground, the opposition in RKP, Bukharin, Shlyapnikov and Rykov established their own party and Kerensky even legalized their party, however banning them from elections. On the other hand, Kamenev, Zinoviev and Preobrazhensky became known as the Old Guard and left for France, however still supporting underground activities in Russia. In 1936 RKP are still banned in Russia and even their former allies in NSP are unlikely to lift a ban, however, if the situation in Russia will be too destabilized, they can hope for restoring Bolshevism in Russia again."
POLITICS_LEV_KAMENEV_DESC:0 "Lev Rosenfeld was born to a family that was involved in revolutionary politics. Lev was an early member of the Bolshevik Party, which he joined as early as 1901. He took part in the first Russian Revolution in 1905, then lived abroad, where he became a close supporter of Lenin, but was arrested on arrival in Russia in 1914. Released from prison in the early days of the February Revolution, Lev Kamenev led the Bolshevik resistance along with Vladimir Lenin and Grigory Zinoviev.\n\nKamenev, like Zinoviev, voted against the armed insurrection of the Bolsheviks, and then they were against the decision of Lenin and Trotsky to create a one-party dictatorship of the proletariat. Recently appointed to the post of head of the VTSIK, Kamenev resigned soon after. The turning point was the assassination of Lenin in 1918. Kamenev supported Zinoviev as the new leader of the Bolshevik party and, as a result of the defeat of the Reds in the civil War, was forced to leave Russia for the French Commune.\n\nAbroad, Kamenev continued to work in the Bolshevik Party, but still tended to create a homogeneous socialist government when returning to Russia. Zinoviev, on the other hand, assumed that if the Bolsheviks returned, if they were not arrested, the other parties would clearly not be happy with them, and therefore advocated a one-party dictatorship, as Lenin had bequeathed.\n\nNow Kamenev is at the head of the party, and despite the internal party opposition, he will strive to adapt the Bolshevik program to the new Russian realities and create a homogeneous socialist government with other parties."
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_MAYAKOVSKY_DESC:0 "Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky was born to an impoverished noble family in Georgia. In 1907 he became an activist in underground Social Democrats' circle and later joined the RSDRP the same year. As a Bolshevik activist he was finally imprisoned for almost a year. He left the party soon after his release, but remained an ardent socialist and became involved in the socialist art instead. He attended the Moscow Art School and became one of the pioneers of Futurist literature in Russia.\n\nMayakovsky embraced the Bolshevik Russian Revolution wholeheartedly and became a fiery propagandist of Bolshevism. A vigorous spokesman for the Communist Party, Mayakovsky contibuted much in a popular image of the Bolsheviks. In 1919 he tried to established Komfut - a Futurist organisation affiliated to the Bolshevik party, but it was swiftly dissolved following the intervention of Anatoly Lunacharsky.\n\nAfter the Civil War Mayakovsky left for Georgia, where he served his role as a Bolshevist propagandist. He occasionally went on journeys to syndicalist Europe, where he promoted Futurism and Proletkult of Lunacharsky. On the basis of his experience, he developed a new ideology of Social-Futurism: what can be called his own desire to create a society of educated and talented people."
POLITICS_ANATOLY_LUNACHARSKY_DESC:0 "Anatoly Lunacharsky is a truly dedicated Marxist with a huge revolutionary experience. A member of the RSDRP since 1895, he had great influence as one of the leaders of the Bolsheviks, along with Alexander Bogdanov and Vladimir Lenin. Lunacharsky became known all over the world after his successful project of Proletarian Culture. Anatoly believed that the workers should belong to the only and exclusive culture of the proletariat, which included more radical aspects, such as the construction of a new religion and god-building - the cult of Reason.\n\nShortly after the October Revolution, Lunacharsky became a People's Commissar and began his ambitious project of Proletkult - firstly a federation of local cultural societies and avant-garde artists. Proletkult aspired to radically modify existing artistic forms by creating a new, revolutionary working-class aesthetic, which drew its inspiration from the construction of modern industrial society in backward, agrarian Russia.\n\nAfter the Civil War the Proletkult was reestablished abroad, where it became not only an international organisation, but also a political program of the French Communards. Lunacharsky led a successful cultural revolution in France, where the ideas of proletarian culture, despite their blatant syndicalist overtones, had a wide impact on the people. His success won him widest possible acceptance.\n\nWith his return to Russia, Lunacharsky is eager to expand his Proletkult project, changing the Russian Society rapidly and radically. As a staunch internationalist, his ultimate dream is to create a unified utopian socialist state."
POLITICS_ALEKSEI_GASTEV_DESC:0 "Alexey Gastev - a member of the RSDRP since 1901, who took part in the 1905 Revolution. Working in Europe at the turn of the century, Gastev witnessed the application of assembly line production which was inspired by the Ford plant in the United States. At that time, he became familiar with French Syndicalism and adopted many of its views, seeing trade unions as a chief means of confronting capitalism by bringing concrete improvements into the lives of workers. By 1913, Gastev had joined the Circle of Proletarian Culture, established by Anatoly Lunacharsky.\n\nIn 1918 after the Revolution, Gastev won election as the Chairman of the Central Committee of the newly created All-Russian Union of Metal Workers. After the defeat of the Bolsheviks, Gastev had to flee for French Commune, where he continued his work not only as a proletarian, but also as a scientist. He developed the theory of Scientific Management of Labor and became widely known for greatly expanding Taylor's ideas and Ford's assumptions. As one of the ideologists of the Proletkult, Gastev's ideas had considerable success in France. Although Gastev is not a true follower of the ideas of Lenin and Zinoviev, his contribution to socialism cannot be denied. Once he is at the head of the country, who knows what great successes Russia will achieve."
POLITICS_GRIGORY_SOKOLNIKOV_DESC:0 "Grigory Sokolnikov is an outstanding revolutionary, who received a doctorate in economics from the Sorbonne, and has been a member of the RSDRP since 1905. Sokolnikov was closely acquainted with Bukharin - with him he organized the social-democratic organization of students in Moscow in 1906. Later, for his revolutionary activities, he was sent into exile, from which he managed to escape abroad. Abroad, he became an active member of the party, became close to Lenin, but opposed their divisive positions and advocated unity within the RSDRP.\n\nSokolnikov returned to Russia with Lenin in the "sealed wagon" and very quickly became one of the leaders of the Moscow Bolsheviks. During the Civil War, he led the nationalization of banks, and also became known as the man who signed the Brest-Litovsk Peace.\n\nSince 1918, he was on the fronts of the Civil War, was the commander of the 8th Army: Sokolnikov, who did not have a military education and experience of independent command, was appointed to this post to strengthen the confidence of the personnel in the supreme military leadership. He was a supporter of the creation of the Red Army on a regular basis with the use of military specialists and was against the policy of decossackization.\n\nAfter losing the civil war, Sokolnikov fled abroad, where he continued to work in the party. He supported Bukharin's idea of the NEP, but did not accept his creation of a new party and regarded it as a betrayal of the Bolsheviks and Lenin. Thus, Sokolnikov became a follower of the idea of 'slow, gradual and cautious implementation of socialism in practice' and strongly opposed Preobrazhensky's position on collectivization and forced industrialization. However, in the party environment, the idea of Preobrazhensky won.\n\nAfter the Bolsheviks took power in Russia, Sokolnikov began to demand a gradual transition to socialism and the introduction of Bukharin's economic policy. It is expected that he was branded as a 'Bukharinist', 'Menshevik' and 'revisionist'. However, with the assistance of other right-wing Bolsheviks, he managed to take a leading position in the Council of People's Commissars and become chairman of the government."
POLITICS_GEORGY_CHICHERIN_DESC:0 "'Chicherin is a great worker, conscientious, intelligent, knowledgeable. Such people should be appreciated. That his weakness is a lack of" command", it does not matter. You never know people with reverse weakness in the world!' - Lenin described Chicherin shortly before his death.\n\nIndeed, Chicherin does not have the necessary ability to manage people. But he is good at something else - diplomacy. He was one of the Bolsheviks who personally signed the Brest-Litovsk Peace, along with Sokolnikov. Soon he became the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, until the collapse of the Bolshevik government.\n\nIn exile in France, he became a representative of Soviet Russia and the RKP at the Third International, ideologically becoming close to the Jacobins.\n\nUpon his return to Russia, Chicherin was elected one of the members of the Central Committee of the RKP at the Congress of Soviets. However, due to his poor physical condition, it is unlikely that he can fully manage the country. Nevertheless, he supported Sokolnikov and said that an immediate transition to socialism in Russia would be a disaster.\n\nNow, once at the head of the country, it is unknown whether Chicherin will be able to be an effective manager. In any case, he relies on the help of supporters, among whom is Mikhail Kalinin."
POLITICS_VYACHESLAV_MOLOTOV_DESC:0 "Vyacheslav Molotov joined the RSDRP in 1906, where he soon joined the Leninist faction of the Bolsheviks. As a member of the Petrograd Revolutionary Military Committee, he was one of the planners of the 1917 revolution.\n\nAfter Lenin's death, Molotov became one of Grigory Zinoviev's closest associates, a proponent of industrialization, urbanization, and modernization in opposition to more moderate Bolsheviks like Kamenev and Sokolnikov.\n\nIn exile in France, Molotov proved to be a good diplomat - he organized all the meetings of the top leadership of the RKP with French leaders, including the leaders of the Jacobin and Sorel parties, and became one of the preachers of Bolshevism among the Jacobin party.\n\nNow, at the head of the state and the party, Molotov is ready to continue the work of Lenin and Zinoviev, albeit with minor improvements, which include forced industrialization and immediate collectivization, an emphasis on nationalism instead of internationalism, as well as a kind of cleansing of society from parasites and hostile elements with the help of labor camps and the Cheka."
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_KALININ_DESC:0 "Mikhail Kalinin - for a long time was one of the most famous Bolsheviks, close associates of Lenin and Zinoviev. He came from a poor peasant family, worked in a factory, and became a member of the RSDRP in 1898. He supported the Bolsheviks in the split of the RSDRP, as he was a supporter of the creation of a militant proletarian party.\n\nHis leadership qualities were shown when, during the February Revolution, he led the disarmament of the guards and the capture of the Finlandsky Railway station, and in August 1917, he was elected a speaker of the Petrograd City Duma. Kalinin actively participated in the preparation and conduct of the October Revolution. In October 1917, several meetings on the preparation of an armed uprising were held by Lenin in Kalinin's apartment on the Vyborg side of Petrograd. After the victory of the October Revolution, in November 1917, he was again elected a speaker of the Petrograd City Duma and, by the decision of the Duma, became the mayor.\n\nAfter Sverdlov's death in 1919, he was elected chairman of the VTsIK. On behalf of the Central Committee, Lev Kamenev, who was appointed chairman of the faction, first appointed Kalinin to the Central Executive Committee, and then to the Chairman. During the Civil War, he conducted propaganda work, traveling to the areas of combat operations, where he spoke as a public speaker-propagandist in the Red Army units and in front of the local population.\n\nAfter losing the civil war, he went into exile in France, where he still held the post of chairman of the Central Executive Committee in exile, and upon the return of power to the Bolsheviks, he had to return to his post formally.\n\nSince the head of the Central Executive Committee is the position of the nominal head of state, in the West Kalinin began to be called the Soviet President or the Workers' and Peasants' President, and in Russia during the civil War the he was generally known as All-Russian Starosta."
POLITICS_NIKOLAY_YEZHOV_DESC:0 "The origin of Nikolai Yezhov remains largely unknown and unsubstantiated. Some say that in St. Petersburg in the family of a Russian worker-foundry, others - that his father served in the Zemstvo guard (police). In any case, what is known for certain is that Yezhov joined the Bolsheviks and in April 1919 was called up to serve in the Red Army, sent to the Saratov base of radio formations, where he first served as a private, and then as a copyist under the commissar of the base management. In October 1919, he took the post of commissar of the school that trained radio specialists, and later remained in Russia, managing to hide his identity.\n\nHowever, Yezhov was always devoted to the ideas of Bolshevism, and soon foreign spies from the RKP came to him and he became their informant in Russia, working personally for Yagoda.\n\nYezhov passionately expected the second revolution and the return of the Bolsheviks, and as soon as this happened, he immediately appeared in the Cheka and was appointed by Yagoda to the post of head of the special department of the OO, whose task was to inform and inform the Red Army.\n\nSoon after he revealed the anti-Soviet activities of his boss Yagoda, he was appointed head of the Cheka in his place. Convinced of the presence of enemies everywhere, together with loyal Chekist supporters, he led the putsch, declared an emergency and took the post of interim chairman of the party.\n\nWho knows how long the state of emergency will last..."
POLITICS_STEPAN_PETRICHENKO_DESC:0 "Stepan Petrichenko is an anarcho-communist who became world-famous after leading the world's first anarchy, the Soviet Republic of Sailors and Builders, in December 1917.\n\nDuring the February Revolution in Russia, he was with the fleet on the Estonian island of Nargen (now Naissaar). Eighty sailors and about two hundred native islanders organized local self-government, which lasted until the capture of Tallinn by the troops of Kaiser Germany on February 26, 1918.\n\nThe red and black flag of the anarcho-communists was lowered, and her government boarded the ships of the Baltic Fleet, heading for Helsinki, and from there to Kronstadt.\n\nIn emigration, Petrichenko's authority among former members of the Soviet Republic of sailors and builders, as well as other anarcho-communists, was high. He emigrated to France, where he supported Makhno and became one of his advisers, although he was never an anarchist by conviction and leaned towards anarcho-communism.\n\nReturning to Russia, he led the anarchist movement of sailors and again the red and black flag of anarchists is flying over the Free Territory of Russia."
POLITICS_GENRIKH_YAGODA_DESC:0 "Genrikh Yagoda, like many other high-ranking Bolsheviks, was directly involved in the October Revolution. From the end of 1919 until the defeat of the Bolsheviks, Yagoda was the head of the Special Department of the Cheka, where he managed to enjoy all the delights of revolutionary terror. During his exile, Yagoda led terrorist cells in Russia from abroad. The operations consisted of recruiting supporters, organizing sabotage and sabotage, and anti-Kerensky and anti-Bukharin propaganda. After Dzerzhinsky and Menzhinsky finally focused all their attention on Poland, where they hoped to stage a coup and left the Cheka, citing the impossibility of a second revolution in Russia in the near future, Yagoda was appointed head of the Cheka and the main contender for the post of People's Commissar of Internal Affairs in the event of a seizure of power by Zinoviev.\nNow Yagoda returned and headed the Cheka directly on the territory of Russia. And soon became the new chairman of the party. This means that the enemies have nowhere to run."
POLITICS_LAZAR_KAGANOVICH_DESC:0 "Who is Lazar Kaganovich? For many, he is an ordinary apparatchik, who would have remained a typical representative of the Bolshevik party, not standing out in any way. Under the influence of agitation and following the example of his older brother Mikhail, who joined the Bolsheviks in 1905, Lazar became a member of the RSDRP at the end of 1911. From 1914 to 1915, he was a member of the Kiev Committee of the RSDRP. In 1915, he was arrested and exiled to his homeland, but soon returned to Kiev illegally. In 1916, he worked as a shoemaker at a shoe factory in Ekaterinoslav, was the organizer and chairman of the illegal Union of Shoemakers, as well as the head of the district and a member of the Ekaterinoslav Committee of the Bolshevik Party. Then he moved to Yuzovka, where he worked at the shoe factory of the Novorossiysk Society and was the head of the Bolshevik organization and the organizer of the Shoemakers' Union.\n\nAfter the February Revolution of 1917, he took an active part in the reconstruction of the Bolshevik organization of Yuzovka, was elected a member of the Committee and Council, and became deputy chairman. In March, he was elected a delegate to the regional conference of the Donbass Councils in Bakhmut. At the end of March, he left for party work in Kiev.\n\nAn active participant in the October Revolution-led the uprising in Gomel. In the elections to the Constituent Assembly, he passed on the Bolshevik list. In December 1917, Kaganovich also became a delegate to the III All-Russian Congress of Soviets. At the Congress of Soviets, Kaganovich was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the RSFSR. From January 1918, he worked in Petrograd. Together with other members of the VTSIK in the spring of 1918, he moved to Moscow, where he became a commissar of the organizational and agitation department of the All-Russian Board for the Organization of the Red Army. At the end of June 1918, he was sent by the Central Committee of the RKP (b) to Nizhny Novgorod, where he was an agitator of the Gubernatorial committee, head of the Central Committee. agitotdel, chairman of the gubernatorial committee and the gubernatorial executive committee. However, soon by the end of 1919, together with other Bolsheviks, he fled the country.\n\nAbroad, Lazar was appointed head of the organizational and instructional department of the Central Committee of the RKP(b). In 1924, he was already accepted into the Central Committee of the RKP and became its secretary. And so his life and work as a secretary continued, until the Bolsheviks again seized power in Russia.\n\nInspired by the successes of the Bolsheviks in Georgia, Kaganovich planned that a similar system would be implemented in Soviet Russia. Now that he is at the head of the state, he will do everything to build a just and equal society, the main principle of which he proclaimed the construction of 'Socialism in one country', and only then - the construction of socialism in all others."
POLITICS_PAVEL_DYBENKO_DESC:0 "Pavel Dybenko is one of the most controversial participants in the civil war. From December 1911, he became a sailor in the Baltic Fleet, was a member of an underground Bolshevik group and engaged in revolutionary activities.\n\nDuring the February Revolution of 1917, he took part in the armed uprising in Petrograd. In April 1917, he became chairman of the Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet. Together with Antonov-Ovseenko, he took an active part in the anti-government action in July 1917 in Petrograd, in the preparation of the fleet for the October armed uprising.\n\nDuring the October Revolution, Dybenko led the formation and dispatch of detachments of revolutionary sailors and warships from Helsingfors and Kronstadt to Petrograd.\n\nIn November 1917, he was elected to the Constituent Assembly of the Baltic Fleet. In January 1918, having at his disposal more than 5 thousand revolutionary sailors, concentrated in Petrograd "to protect public order" in connection with the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, Pavel Dybenko took a direct part in the dispersal of the "Constituent Assembly".\n\nIn February 1918, during the general offensive of the German troops on the Russian-German front, he commanded a detachment of sailors near Narva. Soon Dybenko's squad left Narva. Dybenko's detachment, which retreated to Gatchina, was disarmed on March 6, 1918. For the surrender of Narva, Dybenko was expelled from the RKP, and on March 16, at the IV Congress of Soviets, he was deprived of all posts. Soon arrested. On March 25, 1918, he was released on bail with the condition of remaining in Moscow until the trial, but fled to Samara, from where he was returned to Moscow. In May 1918, he was put on trial and sentenced to death by firing squad, but at the request of his lover Kollontai, he was pardoned. This was the end of Dybenko's valiant activity as a member of the Bolsheviks.\n\nHe did not hide his anarchist views and even supported Makhno in Ukraine, but was forced, like everyone else, to flee to France.\n\nReturning to Russia, he was elected chairman of the Central Baltic, again, and taking advantage of the chaos caused by the Bolsheviks, with the help of sailors, he broke up the government and established the dictatorship of the Central Baltic with the hope of building an anarcho-communist society.\n\nKnown as an avid drunk and bully, it is not known whether Dybenko will be able to be a worthy head of the anarchist movement."
POLITICS_ALEKSANDR_BOGDANOV_DESC:0 "Alexander Bogdanov was a key figure in the early history of the RSDRP and its Bolshevik faction. Bogdanov was one of the founders of the Bolsheviks in 1903, when they split with the Menshevik faction. Moreover, he was a rival of Vladimir Lenin and one of the contenders for the role of leader of the Bolsheviks, until he was expelled in 1909.\n\nAfter the Russian revolutions of 1917, when the Bolsheviks came to power in the disintegrating Russian Republic, during the first years of the RSR, he was an influential opponent of the Bolshevik government and of Lenin, and later of Zinoviev, from a Marxist left-wing point of view. Nevertheless, he became known as one of the creators of Proletkult along with Anatoly Lunacharsky. Between 1918 and 1920, Bogdanov co-founded the proletarian art movement Proletkult and was its leading theoretician. In his lectures and articles, he called for the total destruction of the 'old bourgeois culture' in favour of a 'pure proletarian culture' of the future.\n\nAfter the end of the civil war, like many Bolsheviks, he went to the Commune, where, together with Lunacharsky, he continued the activities of the Proletkult abroad and achieved significant success in promoting proletarian culture in France.\n\nBogdanov was educated in medicine and psychiatry. His broad scientific and medical interests ranged from the theory of universal systems even to the possibility of human rejuvenation through blood transfusions. He invented an original philosophy called 'tectology'. He was also an economist, cultural theorist, science fiction writer, and political activist.\n\nOn his return to Russia, he joined Lunacharsky's Proletkultists faction and became a minister in his government. However, now that he was his successor and became the head of the government, most likely he will want to implement all his concepts, even the most esoteric."
POLITICS_VALERIAN_POLYANSKY_DESC:0 "Valerian Polyansky (real name Pavel Lebedev-Polyansky) - one of the Bolshevik activists since 1903, an active participant in the 1905 revolution. In 1907, he met Lenin, Bogdanov, and Lunacharsky, and later became secretary of the Marxist Forward group founded by Lunacharsky and Bogdanov.\n\nAfter the October Revolution, he was appointed Commissar of the Literary Publishing Department of the People's Commissariat of Education and became Chairman of the All-Russian Council of the Proletkult. In 1918-1936, he was the editor-in-chief of the Proletarian Culture publishing house. His views on art were formed under the influence of A. A. Bogdanov. Polyansky believed that art is 'an educational tool', 'an instrument of social organization of people'. Literature, according to Polyansky, 'directly and indirectly is a means of organization', and ' every literary and artistic work, not excluding works of 'pure art', solves some organizational task, sometimes personal, sometimes broadly social'.\nIn an era when the proletariat has become the leading class,  'organizational class', and when 'our epoch is exclusively organizational, all life is being rebuilt on completely new principles', the artist must 'take the necessary material and process it without diverging from the requirements of the time'. He argued that the proletariat needed collectivist art.\n\nAfter Lunacharsky became chairman of the party, Polyansky was appointed chairman of the Glavlit and became the creator of the so-called Soviet censorship. He claimed that censorship protects the dictatorship of the proletariat and is guided by 'party directives'.\n\nAfter the sudden death of Bogdanov, Polyansky was elected the new chairman of the People's Commissariat of Education and the Party. Perhaps, under him, the country will completely center itself and get rid of dissent."

### Events ###
bolsheviks.1.t:0 "The Bolsheviks Return" 
bolsheviks.1.d:0 "This moment happened. A moment that everyone, even the most committed socialists, feared. In Moscow, a plane landed, on board of which was a delegation from the top leadership of the Central Committee of the RKP. Grigory Zinoviev, the leader of the party since Lenin's death, his right-hand man Lev Kamenev, the main ideologists of the Proletkult - Lunacharsky, Bogdanov and Gastev, economists Grigory Sokolnikov and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky, successful organizers and diplomats Georgy Chicherin and Vyacheslav Molotov, the Kaganovich brothers, as well as the most dangerous man, terrifying all capitalists, Genrikh Yagoda.\n\nDespite all the horror that the Bolsheviks brought to Russia, they were not immediately arrested. They were met by a government car and soon they were placed in the Hotel Metropol. What was it all about? Why were these gentlemen not arrested, or at best executed, and their memory wiped from the face of the earth? Until recently, the Bolsheviks were the terror of all of Europe, but a small group of people who no longer had as much influence and were hated by many. They have no chance of seizing power."
bolsheviks.1.a:0 "It's a miracle if they succeed."

bolsheviks.2.t:0 "Calm Before the Storm?"
bolsheviks.2.d:0 "With the young republic being still too unstable, the decision of military leaders to give all the powers for Bolsheviks seems like madness. The Siberian Insurgency has already damaged the stability in the country, but now is situation is getting out of control. Peasants, who still remember the Red Terror, famine and fear, are starting to become nervous. Very-very nervous. We must expect further insurgency in whole our regions and we will have to deal with it as soon as possible.\n\nBecause if we fail, the Russia will even in a greater danger."
bolsheviks.2.a:0 "Everything's under control..."

bolsheviks.3.t:0 "Yagoda's First Move"
bolsheviks.3.d:0 "Cheka. One word. A great fear for the entire nation.\n\nIn the first months of the Civil War, a special institution was established to fight the 'counter-revolutionaries'. By the end of 1918 it was already the primary organisation, responsible for Red Terror. Thousands of Russians were shot. All of them were against Bolsheviks and Revolution.\n\nWhen in 1920 the Bolsheviks lost the Civil War, the supreme leadership of the Cheka left as well. But they never stopped their activities. During all these 15 years the underground cells were active in Russia, directed by Cheka from abroad. By [GetYear] the leader of the Cheka in Russia is Genrikh Yagoda - a man with no principles, except one - everything for the revolution.\n\nWith the Bolsheviks in power, too weak now, Yagoda makes his first move - he sent the message to all local councils and his message was published in all newspapers. He stated that the Cheka organisation is now back and hiring volunteers to serve the state. And a warning below. Do not resist the Bolshevik Power. Otherwise, you will be punished."
bolsheviks.3.a:0 "Red Terror again?"

bolsheviks.4.t:0 "Peasant Riots"
bolsheviks.4.d:0 "Though the Bolsheviks has just begun their rule over Russia, the first resistance followed. In the prosperous lands of South Russia the Penza peasants began their rebellion. They demand that the Bolsheviks immediately give up power to the Soviets, consisting of socialists and that their individual power must end now. The local Chekists, Militia and even army has already arrived in the region, but still do nothing, awaiting the orders of Zinoviev."
bolsheviks.4.a:0 "First move of peasants..." 

bolsheviks.5.t:0 "The Congress of Soviets"
bolsheviks.5.d:0 "With the Bolsheviks return, the Congress of Soviets was called to decide on some major issues that Bolshevist leaders often quarell on. The supreme executive power is now in the hands of Sovnarkom - Soviet of People's Commissars. The government consists of the Chairman of the Sovnarkom - Grigory Zinoviev, People's Commissars of Economy, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Education (Enlightenment) and others. The decisions, made at the Congress will directly affect the Sovnarkom and the policies, that will be implemented."\
bolsheviks.5.a:0 "The session begins."

bolsheviks.6.t:0 "Mayakovsky Returns From Georgia"
bolsheviks.6.d:0 "The futurist poet, known throughout Europe, Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky returned from Georgia, where he conducted the propaganda policy of the Proletkult. Although he is not a member of the party, he was invited to join the Congress of Soviets, where the supreme leadership of the RKP sits. Joining his colleagues, Lunacharsky and Gastev, Mayakovsky is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland, inspiring the working class of Russia to labor feats, and... submission."
bolsheviks.6.a:0 "He's back."

bolsheviks.7.t:0 "The Peasant Riots Expand"
bolsheviks.7.d:0 "Our first measures were not enough to put down the rebellion, and now the discontent spreads across the regions. While heavily threatening our stability, other revolts will follow if we don't manage to overcome them in time."
bolsheviks.7.a:0 "The Cheka will deal with it!"

bolsheviks.8.t:0 "Proletkultisty Faction Emerges"
bolsheviks.8.d:0 "A faction of Proletcultists - active participants in the Proletkult (Proletarian Culture) program of Lunacharsky have united under his guidance in a small faction in the RKP. Represented by three main leaders, recently repatriated Vladimir Mayakovsky, technocrat and syndicalist Aleksei Gastev and a Proletkult Boss Anatoly Lunacharsky, the faction demands more funds in the Ministry of Education and Enlightenment, as well as beginning of the Second Russian Proletkult as soon as possible. While we cannot stop them, we can support them - and relocate funds to their ministry."
bolsheviks.8.a:0 "Full support for Proletkult!"
bolsheviks.8.b:0 "Right now we have more important matters..."

bolsheviks.9.t:0 "Sokolnikov Against Plan"
bolsheviks.9.d:0 "A prominent Bolshevik, Grigory Sokolnikov has recently held a speech at the Congress, denouncing the Preobrazhensky's Planned Economy. Claiming that the society and economy are not ready for such undertakings, Sokolnikov argued that a cautious and mild approach is needed. If we fail to appease the peasants, they will crush us in a rebellion. Therefore, Sokolnikov stated that Bukharin's NEP should be implemented, at least in the beginning. By doing so, we can expect less resistance from peasants and appease the socialist opposition."
bolsheviks.9.a:0 "An interesting proposal."
bolsheviks.9.b:0 "We won't change our program."

bolsheviks.10.t:0 "The Riot Spreads"
bolsheviks.10.d:0 "We were unable to suppress the riot and now it has spread to the region with Russian minority, sparkling national rebellions of Tatars and Bashkirs. This situation is getting much worse every hour, and if the Cheka is too weak to deal with it, what can we expect from other ministers?\n\nPerhaps, it becomes obvious that Sokolnikov's proposal of adopting NEP is not so bad after all."
bolsheviks.10.a:0 "A disaster!"

bolsheviks.11.t:0 "Peasant Riots Supressed"
bolsheviks.11.d:0 "The peasant riots seem to be finally suppressed by the forces of Cheka, once again proving that this is a powerful organisation that can do anything to secure the stability in the country."
bolsheviks.11.a:0 "Cheka tightens its grip over Russia."

bolsheviks.12.t:0 "The Riot Radicalizes"
bolsheviks.12.d:0 "The Cheka has once again failed to restore control in the regions of peasants and nationalities revolts. But now the situation has gone out of the control.\n\nA Triumvirate of three leaders of the Idel-Ural Tatar Nationalist organisations, Musa Dzhalil, Shafi Almas and Akhmet Temir, has declared the independence of Tatarstan and Bashkurdistan from the Bolshevist Russia. The local militia is already armed and ready to fight us on what they call their national territory. We must immediately crush them to avoid further national rebellions, but some of the RKP members suggest that we should not intervene and crush them later, when the country will be stabilized, avoiding possible war with Transamur."
bolsheviks.12.a:0 "Their state won't live for long."
bolsheviks.12.b:0 "Fight for independent Idel-Ural!"

bolsheviks.13.t:0 "The Tatars and Bashkirs Revolt"
bolsheviks.13.d:0 "The illegitimate government of Bolsheviks have caused the Tatars and Bashirs to rebel. The government, including [ROOT.GetLeader] suggest we should immediately intervene in the war, perhaps at a cost of losing these territories, but right now we have an advantage over forces of Bolsheviks. Perhaps it is our last chance to quickly overthrow them and restore our power over Russia."
bolsheviks.13.a:0 "Guarantee their independence."
bolsheviks.13.b:0 "Declare war on Bolsheviks!"
bolsheviks.13.c:0 "Neither we recognize them!"

bolsheviks.14.t:0 "Sokolnikov and Zinoviev Blamed in Revisionism"
bolsheviks.14.d:0 "The Congress Members, most prominent of whom are Preobrazhensky, current economy minister, joined by Kaganovich and Molotov have denounced the Zinoviev's support for Sokolnikov and accused both of them of revisionism and 'rightism'. Zinoviev though parried the Congressmens' thrust on him, claiming that his allegiance to Marxism is undoubtful, but this left everyone with a shady feeling though."
bolsheviks.14.a:0 "NEP? Never heard about it..."

bolsheviks.15.t:0 "Yagoda Demands Expansion of Cheka"
bolsheviks.15.d:0 "Genrikh Yagoda demanded the expansion of funds and subsidies to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and to be more precise, he wants to make the Cheka a larger and stronger institution. While this is an absolute threat to all non-conformists in Russia, it will possible secure our rule."
bolsheviks.15.a:0 "Subsidize the Cheka!"
bolsheviks.15.b:0 "No more money to Yagoda."

bolsheviks.16.t:0 "More Delegates Announce Support for NEP"
bolsheviks.16.d:0 "Each day more and more RKP members announce support for NEP as a possible choice at least for the first couple of years of the Bolshevist rule. The undeveloped industry, peasant riots and Russia being still a capitalist country affects the popularity and stability of our regime.\n\nHowever, talking about the Central Committee of the RKP and the SOVNARKOM, the opinions there are greatly polarized. The ones who support NEP are in minority. Among them there are Grigory Sokolnikov and Grigory Chicherin with Kamenev having an opinion of creating a homogeneous socialist government and, therefore, appeasing the other socialist parties, who, in majority, are in favour of NEP. On the other side there are Proletkultists, Molotov, Yagoda and Kamenev, who are denouncing the revisionists and looking forward implementing the First Five-Year plan. Zinoviev, personally looking towards the Planned Economy, is somewhat mistrusting every faction, which is not a good sign for the Chairman. But eventally, a formal decision should be made."
bolsheviks.16.a:0 "Announce support for the NEP."
bolsheviks.16.b:0 "Denounce NEP supporters for Menshevism."

bolsheviks.17.t:0 "The Question of Land"
bolsheviks.17.d:0 "Since the first Bolshevist decrees in 1917, the question of land was considered to be solved once and for all. However, with the NEP supporters arising in the party, it is once again debatable. While some believe that in terms of the NEP some private ownership must be saved, the majority of the Sovnarkom believes in immediate land nationalisation and destruction of capitalism in the village as soon as possible."
bolsheviks.17.a:0 "Some of private property shall be saved... for now."
bolsheviks.17.b:0 "Immediately nationalize the land!"

bolsheviks.18.t:0 "The Issue of Third Internationale"
bolsheviks.18.d:0 "While the Bolsheviks were in exile in France, they supported the syndicalist regimes, though claiming that their program shall stay the same and Trade Unions will be state-controlled, at least in Russia. With Bolsheviks now in power, they must decide if they stay with the Third Internationale in their struggle against capitalism and imperialism, or follow their own way of Bolshevism and found the Fourth Internationale."
bolsheviks.18.a:0 "We must respect our ties."
bolsheviks.18.b:0 "Fourth Internationale shall rise!"

bolsheviks.19.t:0 "Connections With Imperialists"
bolsheviks.19.d:0 "Some members of the Party suggest that while we are still in vulnerable position, we must cooperate with Imperialists countries and save our trading contracts and contacts. As expected, this view was suggested by Sokolnikov and supported by Chicherin. The other delegates, though, once again denounced this proposal as 'Imperialistic', 'Revisionist' and 'Menshevist'."
bolsheviks.19.a:0 "We'll need this connections for now."
bolsheviks.19.b:0 "Cooperating with Third Internationale is enough!"

bolsheviks.20.t:0 "Sokolnikov-Chicherin Opposition Grows"
bolsheviks.20.d:0 "With the Congress more and more accepting Sokolnikov's and Chicherin's ideas, two of them have decided to formally announce their Opposition Bloc. Sokolnikov-Chicherin Bloc, already been called 'Rightist Lean' by the other Bolsheviks, is looking forward creating a popular Economy, saving trade contracts with Capitalist countries and appeasing the peoples of Russia. The Bloc almost immediately gained a lot of support from peasants and common citizens, as well as from the other socialist parties, which are still active in our country."
bolsheviks.20.a:0 "Moderate Bolsheviks or Traitors of Lenin?"

bolsheviks.21.t:0 "The Congress Wants Zinoviev's Opinion"
bolsheviks.21.d:0 "With the establishement of the Rightist Lean Opposition Bloc, Zinoviev is now for some reason viewed as a solution to this problem. Though the final decision will still be made by the majority of the Congress members, those who will be supported by Zinoviev will be the likely winners.\n\nZinoviev understood that this decision is very serious and the stability of the party, as well as the stability of country in whole now depends on him.\nMoreover, the opposition was unofficially supported by Kamenev, Zinoviev's closest associate and a very influential Bolshevik. Having always been a supporter of homogeneous socialist government, Kamenev has seen the failure of Lenin and the first socialist revolution as a result of the RKP's previous unability to cooperate with other socialists.\n\nNevertheless, Zinoviev's final decision is..."
bolsheviks.21.a:0 "Support The Rightist Lean"
bolsheviks.21.b:0 "Follow the plan and denounce the opposition."

bolsheviks.22.t:0 "Proletkultisy Opposition Bloc"
bolsheviks.22.d:0 "The Proletcultists have announced their own opposition, based on the Proletkult ideals. Opposed to the Zinoviev's indifference and Yagoda's Cheka priority, they have stated that the best solution to the political crisis in the country is to immediately start Proletkult program and greatly expand it. The Proletarian Enlightenment will bring popular opinion about Bolsheviks as saviors of Russia from illiteracy, exploitation and oppression."
bolsheviks.22.a:0 "The party falls apart..."

bolsheviks.23.t:0 "Molotov-Yagoda-Kaganovich Troika"
bolsheviks.23.d:0 "After the formation of Rightist Lean Opposition bloc, Molotov, Yagoda and Kaganovich announced their triumvirate or troika. They denounced all the Central Committee members of the RKP, including Zinoviev and Kamenev and demanded immediate restitution of original RKP program and ban of any opposition inside the party. Moreover, they once again denounced NEP as 'Menshevist revisionism' and Proletkult as 'Bourgeouis Art Circle' and demanded immediate transition to the socialist society and implementation of planned economy.\nWith the establishement of Troika, the RKP party has finally found itself divided."
bolsheviks.23.a:0 "The Congress Will Decide."

bolsheviks.26.t:0 "Kamenev Joins Opposition"
bolsheviks.26.d:0 "After the assassination of Zinoviev, Lev Kamenev, now alone, has announced his support for the 'Rightist Lean' Opposition Bloc. Known for his anti-radical stance and support of homogeneous socialist government, Kamenev has now openly shown his proper spirit."
bolsheviks.26.a:0 "It was expected."

At first they were our allies during the Civil War, but in 1918 they tried to overthrow us and since then have been our enemies. With our rule still shaky, the Left SRs use any possibility to terrorize the nation and our party. This must be stopped as soon as possible. So, there are several choices and we must make one of them.\nThe first one is to ban the party and arrest the leaders, including Spiridonova and Kamkov. The second choice is to send them in exile to France, where they won't be able to influence us.

Having departed from the orthodox path and program of the Bolshevik Party, [ROOT.GetLeader] threatened the stability of state power and allowed the party to break up into warring factions. For the sake of maintaining stability in the state, the leadership of the Cheka decided to dismiss the revisionist and traitor who tried to take away the future from the workers' and peasants' society."

Nevertheless, Pavel Dybenko has proclaimed the supreme rule of Tsentrobalt and now all the power in the country belongs to him."

bolsheviks.46.t:0 "Chairman Zinoviev's 'Appeal to the Nation'"
bolsheviks.46.d:0 "Today, the chairman of the party, Zinoviev, for the first time since the Bolsheviks came to power, spoke at a rally of thousands in Moscow, where he addressed the nation.\n\n'Comrades! Workers and peasants! Soldiers and officers! The time of capitalist oppression is over. The imperialists of Germany and America are already preparing to lay down their arms and be defeated, to realize the power and strength of the workers 'and peasants' state. Our allies in France and Britain are ready to assist us in the return of our fraternal peoples to their homeland-Ukrainians, Belarusians, friendly Baltic socialists.\n\nComrades! To achieve this goal, we need to rally around the Bolshevik party, because only the Bolshevik party can lead our country to victory - to the power of the workers and peasants! I appeal to the revisionists and the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik opposition, as well as to the followers of the traitor Bukharin! Lay down your weapons, stop fighting. The Soviet government is already here and it will not leave. The government will be organized through the Soviets, under the supervision of the Council of People's Commissars. The enemies of the people will be brought to justice. Once again, citizens! Express your opinion through the Soviets of workers and peasants, and not through Bukharin-Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik revisionist nonsense! Only through cooperation can our nation find unity!'"
bolsheviks.46.a:0 "He has a point!"

bolsheviks.47.t:0 "Centralization of Power"
bolsheviks.47.d:0 "Despite the assurances that the Bolshevik party is democratic to the core, Grigory Zinoviev declared the centralization of power in the hands of authorized Soviets. He says that this measure is temporary and certainly forced because society is unstable. In the future, when the country is sufficiently developed, the power will be decentralized. This decision, however, was received ambiguously by some of the more right-wing members of the party. They were outraged by Zinoviev's decision to centralize power, as this contradicts Marxism. However, Zinoviev, our leader, was able to quickly convince this bunch of unrighteous Bolsheviks of their wrongness"
bolsheviks.47.a:0 "Long live the Council of People's Commissars!"

bolsheviks.48.t:0 "Dissatisfaction With The Collectivization"
bolsheviks.48.d:0 "To our surprise, many peasants were dissatisfied with the collectivization. They were dissatisfied with the socialization of the land, the good that socialism brought them. They are in revolt, demanding the return of their crops, their livestock, and, worst of all, their property. This month, about 3,000 peasant riots have already been suppressed, and a terrible famine has broken out in some regions. The peasants flee to the cities and become workers, because they think that the life of the worker is much better. They are right only in one thing - it is a state for workers, built by workers. While they are rioting, we have achieved results that Kerensky could only dream of. We must bear this burden of collectivization until the end of time, for all power comes from the people, and we are their representatives."
bolsheviks.48.a:0 "They will obey."

bolsheviks.49.t:0 "Vozhd of the Proletariat"
bolsheviks.49.d:0 "Long live the Communist Party of Lenin-Zinoviev! Long live Zinoviev, the Vozhd of the Proletariat!\n\n\nGrigory Zinoviev is the man who led our Communist Party forward to a bright future for 20 years. Having become a worthy successor to Lenin, Zinoviev rallied the party and never left it. Even in the most difficult and cruel days of the Civil war, when Zinoviev was forced to capitulate and go abroad, all this time in exile he remained loyal to the cause of Lenin and socialism. Let his name forever remain in history, and monuments to Zinoviev will be erected in all Russian cities."
bolsheviks.49.a:0 "Cause of Lenin lives because of Zinoviev!"

bolsheviks.50.t:0 "Famine!"
bolsheviks.50.d:0 "In our country, as reported to the Chairman, entire regions are facing a terrible famine. The main factors contributing to the famine, according to the report, are the forced collectivization of agriculture, forced grain purchases combined with rapid industrialization, a reduction in the agricultural labor force, and several severe droughts. All this, of course, is nonsense, and the main reason is the drought, and perhaps the actions of Western spies and saboteurs. In any case, we will have to deal with the famine and its consequences."
bolsheviks.50.a:0 "A tragedy!"

bolsheviks.51.t:0 "The Cause Of Lenin"
bolsheviks.51.d:0 "The precepts of Ilyich became a popular expression, now used at almost every party congress, as well as in the press, which indicates that our country should live and develop along the path set by its founder, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.\n\nLeninism is our ideology! We will create a state for the workers, as Lenin bequeathed, and we will follow its doctrines: socialist industrialization, the co-operation of the peasantry, and the cultural revolution."
bolsheviks.51.a:0 "By following his testaments, we will build communism!"

bolsheviks.52.t:0 "The Ideals of Bolshevism"
bolsheviks.52.d:0 "What is Bolshevism? Of course, the main theorist of Bolshevism is Vladimir Lenin, but many attribute to Bolshevism the ideology of the traitor Bukharin, as well as other various revisionist movements.\n\nIn fact, the ideology of Bolshevism was carefully developed first by Vladimir Ilyich, and then in exile by Grigory Zinoviev and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky. In practice, Bolshevism is a centralized country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which exercises its power through a cohesive and disciplined Bolshevik party. These are industrialization, collectivization, and the creation of a society of justice and intolerance towards revisionists and counter-revolutionaries.\n\nHaving built such a country, we will finally rise from the ashes."
bolsheviks.52.a:0 "Bolshevism is our main doctrine!"

bolsheviks.53.t:0 "Chairman Kamenev"
bolsheviks.53.d:0 "Lev Kamenev, along with Grigory Zinoviev, was for a long time one of Lenin's closest associates. He became known as one of the opponents of the armed revolution in October 1917, and many have not forgotten this, both colleagues and enemies. In addition, for a long time he tried to persuade Zinoviev to reconsider his relations with other socialist parties, because after losing the civil war, Zinoviev thought that no party would accept the Bolsheviks in the coalition.\n\nHowever, history had its own plans. And now Kamenev is at the head of the party, and all the main decisions will be up to him."
bolsheviks.53.a:0 "Long live Chairman Kamenev!"

bolsheviks.54.t:0 "The Fate of the Supreme Soviet"
bolsheviks.54.d:0 "Since the Bolsheviks came to power, the supreme power belonged to the Council of People's Commissars - the so-called Upper Council.\n\nKamenev suggests that the best option would be to decentralize the Sovnarkom - that is, to create a coalition government with other parties, including the Social Revolutionaries, Bukharinites and Mensheviks. This met with a sharply negative reaction among the Central Committee, where most of the members are radically opposed to coalitions with other parties.\n\nNevertheless, as long as the Council of People's Commissars is still subordinate not to the majority, but to the chairman, Kamenev has carte blanche to form a homogeneous socialist government."
bolsheviks.54.a:0 "Let's Choose Our Partners"

bolsheviks.55.t:0 "Lift the PLSR Ban?"
bolsheviks.55.d:0 "Earlier, the Council of People's Commissars banned the activities of the left SR party in Russia and arrested its leaders. This approach was wrong, and now in preparation for the creation of a coalition government, perhaps we should reconsider this decision, and release the leaders of the PLSR from arrest and offer them seats in the Council of People's Commissars?"
bolsheviks.55.a:0 "Lift the ban!"
bolsheviks.55.b:0 "We remember their betrayal during 1918 Uprising"

bolsheviks.56.t:0 "Lift the NSP Ban?"
bolsheviks.56.d:0 "Earlier, the Council of People's Commissars banned the activities of Bukharin's Party of People's Socialists in Russia and arrested its leaders. This approach was wrong, and now in preparation for the creation of a coalition government, perhaps we should reconsider this decision, and release the leaders of the NSP from arrest and offer them seats in the Council of People's Commissars?"
bolsheviks.56.b:0 "We remember Bukharin's betrayal."

bolsheviks.57.t:0 "Lift the RSDRP and PSR Ban?"
bolsheviks.57.d:0 "Earlier, the Council of People's Commissars banned the activities of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary party in Russia and arrested its leaders. This approach was wrong, and now, in preparation for the creation of a coalition government, perhaps we should reconsider this decision, and release the leaders of the RSDRP and PSR from arrest and offer them seats in the Council of People's Commissars?"
bolsheviks.57.b:0 "We fought on different sides in the Civil War!"

bolsheviks.58.t:0 "A New Chairman?"
bolsheviks.58.d:0 "The most important part of creating a homogeneous socialist government and decentralizing power is to be able to concede. That is why Kamenev suggests that in the new Council of People's Commissars, decisions should be made by a majority vote and not by a single decision of the chairman. He is going to resign from the post of chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, while remaining the nominal head of state and Minister of Foreign Affairs. The chair of the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars will go to one of the leaders of the coalition parties. It remains only to choose who exactly."
bolsheviks.58.a:0 "Aleksander Shlyapnikov - a trade-unionist from NSP"
bolsheviks.58.b:0 "Maria Spiridonova - leader of the Left SRs"
bolsheviks.58.c:0 "Nikolai Bukharin should become the chairman!"
bolsheviks.58.e:0 "Viktor Chernov - leader of the PSR"
bolsheviks.58.f:0 "Rafail Abramovich, head of the Mensheviks-Internationalists!"

bolsheviks.59.t:0 "Sokolnikov Leaves the Central Committee"
bolsheviks.59.d:0 "Despite Sokolnikov's support for Bukharin's NEP policy, he was a staunch opponent of Bukharin's treachery. After the appointment of Bukharin to the post of chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Sokolnikov announced that he was leaving the Central Committee of the RKP and the Bolshevik Party. Sokolnikov will probably leave the country, fearing persecution."
bolsheviks.59.a:0 "His authoritarian nature showed up."

bolsheviks.60.t:0 "Zinoviev Leaves the Central Committee"
bolsheviks.60.d:0 "For almost 20 years, the chairman of the Bolshevik Party, Grigory Zinoviev, was an honest fighter for the rights of workers and an active defender of Leninism and Marxism. However, after the decision to appoint a new chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he perceived it as a betrayal and a personal insult. Zinoviev announced his withdrawal from the Central Committee of the party and the creation of an opposition to the current anti-Bolshevik regime of Kamenev."
bolsheviks.60.a:0 "He just cannot recognize his mistakes."

bolsheviks.61.t:0 "Kamenev Curtails Homogeneous Government"
bolsheviks.61.d:0 "After it became clear that all the parties that could presumably be taken into the coalition remained banned, and their leader was still under arrest, Kamenev had no choice but to resign as chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. This role is claimed by many Bolshevik figures, and it is likely that soon the Central Committee of the RKP will re-elect a new candidate."
bolsheviks.61.a:0 "Too bad for us."

bolsheviks.62.t:0 "A New Chairman Re-Elected"
bolsheviks.62.d:0 "As expected, the Central Committee of the RKP re-elected a new chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, who enjoyed the greatest popularity and respect among the members of the Bolshevik party. We can only hope that the life of the workers and peasants will improve under the new chairman."

bolsheviks.63.t:0 "Down With the Cheka Influence!"
bolsheviks.63.d:0 "Since the arrival of the Bolshevik Party to power, the state security body of the Cheka actively began to engage in anti-counter-revolutionary activities. However, the new government believes that the influence of the Cheka is becoming too comprehensive, and the real number of enemies inside the country is not so large. It is necessary to sharply cut the funding of the Cheka and limit their activities before they arrange something bad for us..."
bolsheviks.63.a:0 "The Cheka Power should be limited!"

bolsheviks.64.t:0 "A United Party"
bolsheviks.64.d:0 "After the creation of the coalition government, the Council of People's Commissars came to the conclusion that there was no longer a need for the existence of a structure of various parties with a complex internal mechanism for electing the Central Committee, etc. From now on, there will be a single platform, that is, a united party, in which it will be legally possible to create factions. The Central Committee of the party will be unified and will include representatives from different socialist parties."
bolsheviks.64.a:0 "This will threaten our socialist democracy!"
bolsheviks.64.b:0 "Proletarians of all parties, unite!"

bolsheviks.65.t:0 "Socialist Democracy"
bolsheviks.65.d:0 "Everything happens as planned by Kamenev. The country has begun to slowly recover from the ruins - the workers receive a decent salary, and the peasants work hard in the Russian fields and do not deny themselves anything.\n\nKamenev always saw socialist Russia as such-without the dictatorship of the proletariat, war, deprivation and hunger. All parties work together for the happiness of the citizens of their state, and do not fight with each other for power.\n\nThis, perhaps, was the ideal to which Lenin aspired, but which he could not realize because of the time when the war of man with man raged everywhere. We will remember Comrade Lenin, because it was he who lit up the way for us-a worthy way, how a person should live. And as long as people still have memories of the great Lenin in their memory, our country will stand firm and inexorably go forward to communism."
bolsheviks.65.a:0 "Long Live Russian Socialist Republic!"

bolsheviks.66.t:0 "Choosing Sovnarkom Direction"
bolsheviks.66.d:0 "Before establishing the work of the Council of People's Commissars, we must choose the direction on which we will focus in the course of development. The program will last for a year. We can allocate funds for the development of foreign relations, so as not to find ourselves in international isolation, for the development of the economy, to recover from Kerensky, for the development of the Cheka, to defeat the enemies of the people and spies, or to stop at education: to get rid of illiteracy and promote Soviet power."
bolsheviks.66.a:0 "Focus on foreign relations."
bolsheviks.66.b:0 "Focus on economic development."
bolsheviks.66.c:0 "Focus on internal security."
bolsheviks.66.e:0 "Focus on the Enlightenment."

bolsheviks.67.t:0 "[SOV.GetLeader] Becomes A New Chairman"
bolsheviks.67.d:0 "As a result of the internal party struggle for power somewhere deep inside the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, [SOV.GetLeader] was elected the new chairman of the party and the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Socialist Republic.\n\nRed banners depicting Vladimir Lenin and [SOV.GetLeader] - two leaders of the Russian proletariat are now appearing on the streets of Moscow. Under the new chairman, life in Russia promises to be better, freer and fairer."
bolsheviks.67.a:0 "We congratulate the new Chairman!"
bolsheviks.67.b:0 "Another Soviet Dictator..."


### Prolekult Events ###
proletkult.1.t:0 "Proletkultists Faction Majority"
proletkult.1.d:0 "With the end of the Congress of Soviets, a member of the Proletkultists factiom, [ROOT.GetLeader] became elected the Chairman of the Sovnarkom. The new People's Commissars were appointed soon and now we can start to implement our important policies in the territories of Russia. With the experience we have, the Cultural Revolution will be achieved in few years. The most important issues shall be soon decided on by the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment."
proletkult.1.a:0 "Long live the Proletkult!"

proletkult.2.t:0 "The Issue of Illiteracy"
proletkult.2.d:0 "The absence of Proletkult in republican Russia has led to the fact that most of the population of our country cannot be called literate. Even so, they are not literate from the point of view of proletarian culture. Various capitalist, bourgeois and philistine views have enslaved the consciousness of these people, which means that measures must be taken to proletarize their culture.\n\nThe new program within the framework of the Proletkult was called "Likbez" or the elimination of illiteracy. Active literacy training will begin, and the literate will be obliged to teach the illiterate through labor service. Illiterate students will be taught: to read clear printed and written fonts; to make brief notes necessary in life and official affairs; to read and write down whole and fractional numbers, percentages, to understand diagrams; the students will be explained the main issues of the construction of the Soviet state."
proletkult.2.a:0 "To be illiterate equals to be blind!"

proletkult.3.t:0 "Proletarian Ethics"
proletkult.3.d:0 "The so-called proletarian ethic is a necessary condition for the development of proletarian culture. Instilling a proletarian ethic will not be easy, but it is important - with the help of a powerful propaganda campaign of our ideas, we will achieve unprecedented success. Our proletkult program will be very powerful, such as the world has never seen before."
proletkult.3.a:0 "Long live the Cultural Revolution!"

proletkult.4.t:0 "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.d:0 "Mayakovsky proposed to introduce his own ideas into the Proletkult - what he calls Social-Futurism. He proposes to create a society of educated and talented people. Everyone should master any art - the one that he or she will like. Training in painting, and especially in modern styles, architecture, and music, will be necessary and mandatory for everyone, both adults and children. The creation of the Soviet intelligentsia is the ultimate goal of the Mayakovsky plan. And he sincerely does not understand and is not going to recognize the right of people to choose if they should do arts or not. 'Art is not a hindrance to work' - as Mayakovsky correctly put it\nThe only question is whether the People's Commissariat of Education will support such an initiative."
proletkult.4.a:0 "Full support for Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.b:0 "That's somewhat... insane."

proletkult.5.t:0 "Soviet-Syndicalist System"
proletkult.5.d:0 "Aleksei Gastev, a scientist and proletarian who worked in Europe for many years, argues that the People's Commissariat of Education is obliged to put the issue of trade unions on the agenda. According to Gastev, Russia needs to combine the Soviet and syndicalist system of government. All economic power should belong to trade unions and autonomous collectives (syndicates) of workers, and all political power should belong to Soviets elected at all levels.\n\nGastev's ideas have surprised some people's commissars, but many recognize the success and viability of the syndicalist system of government. Perhaps in symbiosis with the Soviets, the system will work even better."
proletkult.5.a:0 "Full support for Soviet Syndicalism"
proletkult.5.b:0 "You can't combine incongruity"

proletkult.6.t:0 "Proletarian Religion"
proletkult.6.d:0 "Lunacharsky, being a respected man, suggested that the People's Commissariat of Education return to his early ideas: the creation of a proletarian religion. Of course, many people are skeptical: after all, Marxism is equal to atheism. However, Lunacharsky insists on his own, as the head of the People's Commissariat of Education, he has the right to do so. Unless, of course, the ideas of Mayakovsky or Gastev are more preferred by the People's Commissars."
proletkult.6.a:0 "Full support for Proletarian religion!"
proletkult.6.b:0 "The idea is insane, Lunacharsky should forget about it!"

proletkult.7.t:0 "New Chairman of the Narkompros"
proletkult.7.d:0 "It is time to choose the new chairman of the Narkompros. The most possible candidate is likely to be the candidate, who has more influence and authority over Sovnarkom, and whose ideas are more liked by the People's Commissars. However, a compromissable variant can be made: fulfill the program of the new chairman, though implementing some ideas of the other candidates."
proletkult.7.a:0 "Mayakovsky is a preferable choice"
proletkult.7.b:0 "Gastev is a preferable choice"
proletkult.7.c:0 "Lunacharsky is a preferable choice"

proletkult.8.t:0 "Chairman Mayakovsky"
proletkult.8.d:0 "Mayakovsky has found himself at the very top: he's now the Vozhd of the Proletariat and Chairman of the Sovnarkom. Though he's not a member of the RKP, he decided to change the name of the party and become its new leader. In his first decree, the Communist party was renamed into Proletarian Party of Futurists and its main ideology was stated as Social-Futurism - a minor branch of Marxism. Though some did not like the changes, blaming Mayakovsky in revisionism - they were quickly silented by exclusion from the party. With PPF standing triumphant, Mayakovsky is standing firmly as the Leader of the Avant-Garde."
proletkult.8.a:0 "It's time to implement our policies!"

proletkult.9.t:0 "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.9.d:0 "For many members of the already modified party, it is not entirely clear what social-futurism is. Despite the fact that Mayakovsky made many speeches about the new ideology of the proletarian state, not everyone clearly represents the implementation of his projects in practice.\n\nIn fact, everything is much simpler than it seems. The main idea of social futurism is to create a society of talented and educated people, where everyone has mastered some art and is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland and world socialism. Perhaps Mayakovsky's ideas are in many ways utopian and unrealizable - but with what optimism the people's poet strives for this goal!"
proletkult.9.a:0 "Long Live Social-Futurism!"

proletkult.10.t:0 "Modern Art Exhibitions"
proletkult.10.d:0 "Wonderful leisure and entertainment in the proletarian republic are available to everyone!\n\n\nBy a new decree of the Chairman of the Federal Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vladimir Mayakovsky, all exhibitions of contemporary art featuring works by world-famous artists will be free for everyone forever.\n\nContemporary art, including its new forms such as suprematism and Cubism, is the voice of the proletarian, a challenge to capitalism and exploitation. Admiring contemporary art is not a right or a desire, it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen who believes in socialism and hates the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe exhibitions will feature works by Kazemir Malevich, one of the leading figures of futurism and chairman of the Art Board of the Art Department of the People's Commissariat of Education, Marc Chagall , one of the leading avant-garde artists, as well as some works by Picasso brought from chaos-ridden Spain."
proletkult.10.a:0 "Awesome!"

proletkult.11.t:0 "Free Master Classes"
proletkult.11.d:0 "Free clubs and master classes will be organized throughout the country, in which young and adult citizens of the proletarian republic will be taught the relationship of chromatic tones, contrasts and nuances of light and dark, black and white gradations, graphic means of line and silhouette, and the texture of the paint layer.\n\nIn addition to painting, young avant-gardists will be given lessons in dance and music, including modern futuristic genres. Music clubs will study the theory of music and sound, harmony, musical notation and musical forms. At the dance lessons, you will be able to learn harmonic movements and poses, plastic and facial expressions, tempo and rhythm, as well as master modern and popular genres.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to literary circles: in Moscow and Petrograd, master classes will be given by Velimir Khlebnikov, Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak and Daniil Kharms. There are rumors that even the master of verse, the thunderstorm of all capitalists and the genius of the poetic word, will perform at the literary master class in the capital: Vladimir Mayakovsky himself."
proletkult.11.a:0 "Proletkult is great!"

proletkult.12.t:0 "Theater and Cinema"
proletkult.12.d:0 "in all cities of Russia in the largest theaters will be free performances with the latest productions of Vsevolod Meyrehold, based on the plays of Mayakovsky. In the same cities where there is no theater yet, it was decided to immediately build and open to the public the so-called people's theaters.\n\nCinema is also rapidly developing. Thanks to the achievements of socialism, this year viewers across the country will be able to see Sergei Eisenstein's film "Alexander Nevsky"for free. In it, the Old Russian prince confronts the imperialist invaders of the Teutonic Order, who are referred to in the film as the Germans. Surprisingly, the main antagonist, the leader of the Teutonic Knights, was named Wilhelm. Is this a reference to the German Kaiser, or is it just a satire on inhumane capitalism? In any case, the film tells about the victory of the Russian people-ordinary peasants and workers, led by the Vozhd, who composes his words in beautiful verses."
proletkult.12.a:0 "Masterpiece!"

proletkult.13.t:0 "Obligatory Creative Education"
proletkult.13.d:0 "The resolution of the Council of People's Commissars, signed personally by Vladimir Mayakovsky, reads as follows:\n\nEvery citizen of the Proletarian Republic is obliged from an early age to learn any kind of art: painting, music, dance, acting, or literature. Attendance at children's clubs is mandatory and will be supervised by teachers and school principals. For adults, separate clubs will be organized, which they will be required to attend every week on weekends.\n\nThanks to the organized free exhibitions within the framework of the Proletkult, which contributed to the popularization of art among most of the citizens of the proletarian republic. Even though some of them are dissatisfied with this decision, the Council of People's Commissars knows better, doesn't it?"
proletkult.13.a:0 "We'll build a nation of the talanted!"

proletkult.14.t:0 "With Hammer and Sickle"
proletkult.14.d:0 "The new 'Soviet identity' must be forged with a hammer and sickle. The rich culture and history of all the peoples inhabiting the Proletarian Republic should undoubtedly be perpetuated in memory. But as for the present and the future, the Proletkult takes over.\n\nThe new Soviet identity is not just a brand in the passport of citizenship. This is a new Soviet culture, a new nationality and a new language.\n\nMeasures to internationalize the Russian language and the languages of national minorities, that is, to translate them into the Latin alphabet, are not enough. What is needed is a more radical reform of the language and its slow transformation into a new one: free from the yoke of capitalism, not imposed from outside. The new Proletarian language will be based on the Latin alphabet and use Latin roots to bring our peoples closer to the peoples of the socialist countries of France, Italy and England.\n\nSo far, the measures taken by the government are not enough, but soon, perhaps even in this decade, the schools of the Proletarian Republic will learn the grammar of the PROLYAZ - the Proletarian language."
proletkult.14.a:0 "New times need new methods."

proletkult.15.t:0 "Emergence of Soviet Intelligentsia"
proletkult.15.d:0 "Quite expected was the emergence of the Soviet intelligentsia - the most educated and honored workers of the Proletarian Republic-academicians, professors, scientists, inventors, artists and musicians.\n\nThe so-called party nomenclature was replenished with the ranks of new, successful citizens, ready for work and defense.\nIn other socialist countries, such inequality is unacceptable, but here is the whole point: in our republic, there will be no inequality of the intelligentsia and the common people. In our republic, there will be no ordinary people at all. The ultimate goal of our beautiful socialist society is to build it. Classless, without division into rich and poor, educated and uneducated, talented and untrained. Yes, they say that talent is an exceptional thing. But will you say it to Mayakovsky's face? Of course not."
proletkult.15.a:0 "Every man an Intelligentsia!"

proletkult.16.t:0 "Repressions Against Philistines"
proletkult.16.d:0 "Many did not take seriously the demands of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman Mayakovsky on compulsory creative education. Moreover, even if they did, it wasn't serious. They did not put enough effort into mastering the art. This is what causes the inequality and higher position of the intelligentsia. Do you think they deserve it? Perhaps. But this is unacceptable for a socialist state that bears the proud name of a Proletarian Republic!\n\nFrom now on, and forever, the avoidance of creative activity will be prosecuted with all severity. Citizens who have given up creative activity will work for the benefit of the motherland in labor camps: build new river channels, build hydroelectric power stations, plant forest belts. They will not be useless as before. If they dare to criticize the government's decisions, their fate will be more severe. They will be shot for treason, for their pettiness, commercialism, laziness and lack of talent.\n\nRemember, citizens! The party does not forgive you for your laziness. Labor has made a man out of an ape, and creativity has made a superman out of a man. The party will never forgive you for this."
proletkult.16.a:0 "If you don't respect our rules - why should we respect yours?"

proletkult.17.t:0 "Great Construction Projects of Communism"
proletkult.17.d:0 "Man must be a friend and a brother to nature. But before we can move on to such a relationship, we must tame and conquer nature. Nature will serve us as a good friend if we learn to use its rich land resources, to irrigate it with rivers and lakes, generously provided to us.\n\nThe Great Construction Projects of Communism - that's what the Council of People's Commissars called the projects that we will soon have to make. The main and key ones are undoubtedly the connection of the Baltic and White Sea through the White Sea-Baltic Canal, the connection of Moscow and the Volga through the Mayakovsky Canal, the connection of the Don and Volga through the Volgodonsk Canal, as well as the turn of the Siberian Rivers to irrigate the barren and arid lands of Central Asia. The construction of hydroelectric power stations on many rivers will give us a lot of energy, which we use for the benefit of the people."
proletkult.17.a:0 "A great idea!"

proletkult.18.t:0 "Mayakovsky - The Leader Of The International Avant-Garde!"
proletkult.18.d:0 "Today, our leader, the great poet, the head of the futurist party, the genius of the word and the maestro of poetry, Vladimir Mayakovsky, had the courage to put forward his legitimate rights to the role of the leader of the international avant-garde.\n\n'Futurists of all countries, unite! Proletarians of all countries, unite! Artists, musicians, avant-gardists! This world belongs to us, simple workers, and not to tsars, emperors or the litter of the bourgeoisie! Down with the shackles! Long live the International!'"

proletkult.19.d:0 "With the election of Comrade Gastev as chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he issued a decree on the immediate transition to his program 'Ustanovka'.\n\nAs part of the program, Syndicates will be created throughout the country - systematic associations of workers, industrial sectors and organizations. The All-Russian Committee of Trade Unions, the VKPS, was given executive power in the fields of economy, finance, industry and trade. With the decree adopted, the People's Commissariat of Economy and Finance was abolished, and all its People's Commissars were dismissed.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the reform is to create a Soviet-syndicalist system of government, in which all political power belongs to the Soviets, and all economic power belongs to the trade unions and syndicates. In order to avoid a conflict of interest, Gastev was appointed the new chairman of the VKPS. He will oversee both the political and economic decisions of the branches of government.\n\nIn addition, by Gastev's decision, the RKP is renamed the RSPRP - the Russian Syndicalist Trade Union Labour Party. All members of the RKP who do not agree with the current policy will be excluded from the party and ostracized."
proletkult.19.a:0 "A great reform!"

proletkult.20.t:0 "Management of Labour"
proletkult.20.d:0 "The Russian worker is no different from the European or American worker. Why, then, are production efficiency and labor productivity higher in their countries? It's all about standardizing production. In our country, we will create a standardization of labor.\n\nThe Russian worker does not know fatigue or sleep. He works all day for the success of his country. At least, that's what they say, but it's not true, because the Russian worker was a real slave. He used to work for the success and wealth of a capitalist. Now everything will change. Everyone gets tired. With a clearly distributed time, the worker will not get tired, and observing safety precautions, and most importantly-knowing how to work correctly, his productivity will increase significantly."
proletkult.20.a:0 "And so will increase country's productivity"

proletkult.21.t:0 "A State Without Nation"
proletkult.21.d:0 "Many believe that it is impossible to change the mentality of an entire nation. However, what if there is no longer any nation? In our international state, there is only a worker. The worker has no nation, he has only labor. Work that makes him well-fed and contented, and his state-strong and powerful. We are going to change the foundations of society. Down with the church! Down with the kulaks! Down with the bourgeois elements! It is necessary to take measures for the urgent collectivization of the village, the destruction of the kulaks and the promotion of the idea of proletarianism and labor!"
proletkult.21.a:0 "They will obey."

proletkult.22.t:0 "Central Institute of Labour"
proletkult.22.d:0 "Comrade Gastev is convinced of the need for systematic work on the study of labor processes in order to improve them. To this end, it is necessary to create a Labor Institute. He outlined the structure of the Institute of Labor at the VKPS and the methodology of its work. The Central Institute of Labor was recognized as 'an institution for the development, demonstration and promotion of the principles of scientific organization of labor and training of the labor force'.\nThe main activity of the CITA will be the problems of rationalization of methods and methods of work, training of workers. Gastev's 'Labor Attitudes (Ustanovki)' doctrine will introduce an original technology of vocational training — the "CIT system", focused on standardized, accelerated, programmed and mass training of skilled workers. This method is based on training workers in certain, most rational labor techniques for manufacturing products on the basis of dividing operations into techniques and movements, studying them and selecting the most rational ones.\n\nA special syndicate, called the 'Ustanovka' under the Gastev program, will be organized under the CIT, it will send specialists-consultants to introduce innovations in scientific work at enterprises. Foreign specialists from France and Britain will also take part in the organization of the syndicate's work. The instructors will work in all sectors of the national economy."
proletkult.22.a:0 "A great development!"

proletkult.23.t:0 "Society of Technocrats"
proletkult.23.d:0 "Tectology is a science formulated by A. Bogdanov, one of the prominent ideologists of the Proletkult in the 1920s in exile. It didn't get much attention from the public, but it caught Gastev's attention.\n\nIn accordance with the fundamental assumptions of tectology, two or more elements included in a single process can, with a special organization (organization), exceed the effectiveness of the functioning of these same elements separately. These ideas formed the basis of the Soviet-Syndical system.\n\nAs practice shows, the system works well, largely due to the leadership of Gastev, as a balancing element in the political system.\n\nIn addition, Bogdanov introduced the concept of technical intelligentsia. These are the most educated and successful people in our republic, who should be at the head of certain departments and manage the rest. This is exactly what is happening now, but the engineers have been joined by academics and scientists who are familiar with objectivity, empirical evidence, and progress."

Time is rushing forward like a steam locomotive, on the rails of progress!\n\nTime passes, and it passes quickly. But we can follow it - and we must, for the good of all mankind! With the Gastev program, our country has already achieved unprecedented results, and everything is still ahead. We have increased labor productivity several times, and the workers have finally begun to live normally and receive decent wages. Time cannot be stopped or overtaken, but we can and will do the most important thing - to keep up."

proletkult.25.d:0 "What was supposed to happen happened. Anatoly made a long way up - to the very top. Known all over the world as the ideologist and creator of the Proletkult, he is now at the top of Soviet power - the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Under his leadership, hundreds of employees work hard for the benefit of the motherland.\n\nMany people no longer know where Lunacharsky started - what ideas inspired him to work and develop every day to achieve general humanistic goals. Instead, with his closest associate, Alexander Bogdanov, he could sit for hours, talking about what he had not publicly mentioned or written about for a long time.\n\nAnd so, on one of these beautiful days, during an ordinary conversation, Anatoly asked: 'Alexander, but still, in your opinion..."

proletkult.26.t:0 "The Proletarian Religion"
proletkult.26.d:0 "Many were confused when they read in the morning papers about one of the first resolutions of Chairman Lunacharsky - about the creation of a proletarian religion in the country. Now, at the highest level, this decision has been made and will soon be implemented.\n\nBut this is a religion - not a religion in the ordinary sense of the word. This is something more than a belief in fairy tales. The proletarian religion is the belief in a different God. The one who moves our society forward - Progress. The one who brings our society together - Collectivism. And most importantly - the one who allows it all to become true - the Reason."
proletkult.26.a:0 "That's a brand new religion!"

proletkult.27.t:0 "Age of Reason"
proletkult.27.d:0 "The age of Reason has arrived. The decadence and degradation of the era of Tsarism and Kerenskyism led to the fact that people no longer believe in anything. Many turn to Christianity, where the church deceives them and takes away the last thing they had. Within the framework of de-Christianization, we will not kill the priests, although this is the best that could comprehend them. They will be required to adopt a new religion, and if they refuse, they will be arrested and spend their entire lives in labor. The old temples and churches will no longer serve the liars. From now on, these will be Temples of Reason and Truth, where people will be able to find the right answers to questions from the point of view of science and progress, and Marxism, of course."

proletkult.28.d:0 "Many forget who became the scourge of the world bourgeoisie - who enlightened millions of workers around the world, who led the world's first socialist state, but was betrayed and killed by the counter-revolution?\n\nThis man is Lenin. And his ideas will live forever. Now officially the ideology of our party is called Marxism-Leninism. Lenin is not just a true revolutionary, a courageous man who fell victim to the counter-revolutionary terror of the Social Revolutionaries, but also the main personification of the revolution and socialism. He died for a great idea - a society without masters, where everyone is equal and there is no exploitation, oppression and property. A society where a person does not own a person. It was Lenin who showed us the path of true equality - what we should strive for. Even though he is no longer with us, we will always remember that he sacrificed his life to make our lives better.\n\nLet the exaltation of the memory of the national and international hero, the savior of all the weak and the poor, begin. Monuments to Lenin will be erected in the squares, and his works will be studied in schools. We will never forget his feat."

His body was cremated, and an urn with his ashes was placed in the Kremlin wall on Red Square.\n\nThe whole country mourns the loss of our great and beautiful Anatoly. According to his letters to close friends, Anatoly saw Alexander Bogdanov as his successor. The Central Committee of the party decided to respect the last will of the chairman and unanimously voted for the appointment of Bogdanov as the new chairman.

He claims that blood transfusion is one of the greatest achievements of modern proletarian science. Thanks to the transfusions, we will be able to save countless lives of our soldiers and citizens!\n\nHowever, there are rumors in Moscow that supposedly the Blood Institute performs rejuvenation operations! Of course, Alexander Bogdanov has for long promoted his own theory of rejuvenation, that young blood can help an aging body, but did Lunacharsky authorize these operations?"

During the construction and operation of this cyclotron, we have accumulated invaluable experience in working with nuclear reactions, which will help us in the future in the development of nuclear energy.\n\nOur scientists say that soon, thanks to this development, more efficient and powerful machines will be invented, thanks to which it will be possible to split the core and get huge energy."

However, as it turned out, the student was ill with malaria and tuberculosis, which Bogdanov presumably knew about. A terrible tragedy has occurred! During the eleventh exchange transfusion with the student, rejection and death occurred. Bogdanov died as a result of the operation.\n\nThe whole country is mourning and grieving over the death of the chairman of the party - the ideologist of the proletkult and one of the smartest people in the world. He will be replaced as chairman by Valerian Polyansky, Chairman of the All-Russian Proletkult Council, editor-in-chief of the 'Proletarian Culture' publishing house, as well as the head of Glavlit and the creator of the Soviet censorship.

It is necessary to deprive the peasantry of class division and to introduce proletarian culture to them! Therefore, on the instructions of the chairman of Lunacharsky, the immediate collectivization of the village began! Individual peasant farms will be merged into collective farms in order to transform private individual farms into public ones in order to ensure the greatest control by the state and the party over the country's agriculture.\n\nCollectivization will solve the problem of limited distribution of industrial crops in the conditions of small individual farms and form the necessary raw material base for the processing industry. Also, the cost of agricultural products will be reduced, as well as through mechanization, the productivity and efficiency of labor in agriculture will increase.\n\nThe result of collectivization will be the availability of agricultural products to the masses in an amount sufficient to form food reserves, and supply the rapidly growing urban population with food."

Not everyone agrees with the adoption of Bukharin's doctrine, and considers it revisionism and the same betrayal that Bukharin committed many years ago. Sokolnikov has a lot to change in the personnel of the Central Committee of the RKP, if he wants to succeed, otherwise the more radical Bolsheviks can remove him."

Many openly call him a revisionist and Bukharinist, and even accuse him of Menshevism. Of course, such an image does not contribute to the popularity of Sokolnikov, which means that urgent measures are needed for 'Debukharinization'.\n\nUndoubtedly, Sokolnikov is not an adherent of Bukharin's ideas, moreover, despite the fact that they began their journey together, Bukharin's betrayal and his decision to kowtow to Kerensky and the bourgeois-democratic government of the Petrograd regime, greatly shocked Sokolnikov. However, he could not but recognize the viability of the NEP in the early years of the transition to full-fledged socialism.\n\nIn this regard, urgent measures will be taken to ostracize Bukharin, delegitimize his party, which will be banned, and all activists will be arrested for anti-state activities. Bukharin's face will hang in every yard, crossed out and with a huge inscription TRAITOR TO SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM!"

sokolnikov.3.t:0 "Reaffirm Trading Contracts"
sokolnikov.3.d:0 "Our young republic needs to abide by trade agreements with other powers, including capitalist ones, until we can take care of ourselves. Like other decisions of Sokolnikov, this is one of the most controversial. Many believe that since we accept money from the capitalists, they can sponsor our economy on their own terms. Of course, this is not the case. Moreover, what could be better than the fact that the imperialists and capitalists pay the Socialist state, and therefore sponsor socialism?"

sokolnikov.7.d:0 "By the decree of Sovnarkom, signed by Sokolnikov, the poorest strata of the society will now pay no taxes at all. At the same time, the Kulaks, who are naturally exists because of the 'Capitalism in the city' principle of NEP, are gonna pay more taxes at a progressive rate proportional to their income.\n\nBy implementing this tax, we will ensure social and economic equality in the village and stop Kulaks from becoming too wealthy."

sokolnikov.9.d:0 "The Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee is nominally the highest state position in the Republic of Soviets. It became such in connection with the death of Sverdlov and the appointment of Mikhail Kalinin back in 1919. During the reconstruction of the Soviet government, the VTSIK, as well as its chairman, were restored, and Mikhail Kalinin again headed this authority. [ROOT.GetLeader] suggests that Mikhail Kalinin is a promising Bolshevik who can is capable of more useful work. As the head of the executive branch, he will have approximately the same powers as the President of the Russian Republic - that is, to represent Russia abroad, along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In many ways, his position will remain, of course, decorative, but the government led by [ROOT.GetLeader] will be under the head of the VTSIK."

molotov.1.d:0 "In his first speech as head of the party, Molotov announced the new course of the country - national Bolshevism.\n\nFor many delegates, this concept was not available for understanding, and therefore, the chairman made a theoretical justification for the new ideology of the party.\n\nNational Bolshevism proceeds from the obvious fact that only Bolshevism and the Bolshevik party can pull the country out of medieval feudalism and chaos. In the civil war, reaction won - and the republic was doomed. For 20 years, the peasants waited for land, and the workers for factories. But the landlords and capitalists who retained power were only enriched by German handouts.\n\nThe time of pain and suffering of our people is over. Only Bolshevism can save them. Not the syndicalism inherent in the Western countries, nor the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik capitalism, nor the revisionism of Bukharin. Only one party, unjustly expelled and excommunicated from the people, can change life in the country. And this is the party of the Bolsheviks."
molotov.1.a:0 "Bolshevism will prevail."

molotov.2.t:0 "Council of Labour and Defense"
molotov.2.d:0 "The Council of Labor and Defense was first established in November 1918, in the midst of the blazing civil War. The Council served as an emergency "national economic cabinet", issuing emergency decrees in an attempt to support industrial production for the Red Army in the face of economic collapse.\n\nHowever, the Council of Labor and Defense did not live long, as did the power of the Bolsheviks. With the end of the civil war, the council was dissolved. However, now, according to Molotov, the council should be restored, because, as the chairman said, we are still in a state of civil war. Peasant uprisings, small-nation uprisings, capitalists and imperialists, revisionists and opportunists, Trans-Amur traitors-all are ready to take advantage of the weakness of the Soviet republic and tear it apart.\n\nThe Labor and Defense Council will be restored. And it will be headed by Chairman Molotov. Our economy will develop by leaps and bounds, collectivization and industrialization are waiting for us - and the faster the better for us and the worse for our enemies."

The movement has become incredibly popular, and it is quite possible that soon many citizens will be inspired by the feat of Efremov and become leaders in their industries. The movement has already received the name "Efremovites" after the initiator, and Efremov himself was appointed chairman of the kolhoz."

molotov.4.t:0 "With A Hammer Blow"
molotov.4.d:0 "Molotov, whose party pseudonym literally translates as 'Hammer', gives great importance to labor and defense. Having replaced the hammer and sickle with a symbol of totalism - and at the same time a symbol of labor and defense - the sword and hammer, Molotov is ready to continue his program.\n\n'With a blow of the hammer' is the new motto of all the proletarians and peasants of the country. Only with a cold look, in the sweat of our brow, can we become stronger and more secure. We need to immediately increase the rate of production, and the sooner the better."

molotov.5.t:0 "Declaring War on Unemployment"
molotov.5.d:0 "During the Kerensky regime, unemployment only increased every year, but those days are long gone. In our state, there will be no unemployment at all. It's very simple. Until recently, unemployed people were only condemned and subjected to social ostracism, they did not want to communicate with them, because they are not ready to serve labor and socialism. However, now everything has changed. The Council of Labor and Defense proposed to introduce administrative penalties, including fines and arrests for the unemployed, but Chairman Molotov proposed a more ingenious idea. After all, you can't argue that the unemployed are parasites. And when they run out of money to pay fines, they will sit under arrest - and rest.\n\nMolotov proposed to toughen the punishment and make it criminal. But no, they won't shoot anyone. Instead, labor camps will be created in which convicted parasites will work for the benefit of the country. The so - called General Management of the camps, under the leadership of both the Council of Labor and Defense and the Cheka, will control the work of prisoners."

Thanks to the triumph of the sword and the hammer, our country is successfully developing from an agrarian semi-feudal backward state into an industrially developed socialist state. National Bolshevism, as a belief in the Bolshevik party and in the peoples inhabiting the territory of the former Russian Empire, triumphed in the minds of ordinary people. They realized how right the Bolsheviks were in their endeavors, how wise and clever the great chairman Vyacheslav Molotov is."

This decision was criticized by some non-essential party members, who, however, soon changed their minds. However, the so-called "fraternal triumvirate" of Michael, Lazarus, and Julius was created with the aim of creating a centralized government as part of Kaganovich's fight against dissent."
kaganovich.1.a:0 "The Bolshevik dynasty?"

kaganovich.2.t:0 "Choosing Our Direction"
kaganovich.2.d:0 "Since the People's commissariats of the national economy and internal affairs are now under the rule of the Kaganovich brothers, Lazar must choose which of the brothers he can count on more. Mikhail, on the one hand, is a rather hot-tempered person who does not seriously focus on work, on the other hand, Julius is really a talented security officer. However, the situation in the country should also be taken into account. It is full of spies and various counter-revolutionaries, but on the other hand, the economy, already destroyed by the German henchman Kerensky, is completely fucked up. It is necessary to make a decision on what to focus on."

kaganovich.3.t:0 "A Drunk Brawler"
kaganovich.3.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was stunned by the news that his brother Mikhail, moreover, the People's Commissar of the National Economy, was in the drunk tank last night. Like a real rowdy, Mikhail, having got drunk in the 'Rumochnaya', began to shout near the street Solyanka in Moscow 'the Internationale'. Residents of nearby houses complained about the night noise and the good thing that they called the police, and did not call directly the Lubyanka, which is only half an hour on foot. The police officer who arrived at the scene found the People's Commissar lying on the ground, seemingly unconscious, drunk in a frenzy. But in his usual manner, Mikhail was only joking. When the policeman approached the drunk and began to shake him, trying to bring him to his senses, Mikhail quickly opened his eyes and laughed in the face of the dazed policeman. Of course, soon after that, he was detained and taken to the local drunk tank in the Kitaygorodsky district. There the People's Commissar safely slept through, and in the morning, as if nothing had happened, went to work.\n\nNow he sits with a guilty face in front of the chairman, and assures him of his innocence."

kaganovich.4.t:0 "Another Incident"
kaganovich.4.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that his brother Mikhail, who was also the People's Commissar of the National Economy, had failed all the deadlines for the delivery of an important agricultural object. At work, Mikhail joked a lot, shouted at the top of his voice, and did everything from playing checkers with local peasants to tipping a glass of rural moonshine. This behavior of the People's Commissar, of course, is irresponsible and destructive. Mikhail had already been warned that he would be removed from his leadership position in the party and expelled from the Central Committee. However, he did not listen to the advice and continued to behave like a ridiculous child. By the decision of the congress, it was unanimously decided to expel Mikhail from the Central Committee and appoint a more suitable person to this position - Nikolai Krestinsky.\n\nEyewitnesses say that Mikhail endured his resignation hard, ranging from a heavy drinking binge, ending with the denial of Marxism and cursing Lenin, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Yagoda, Molotov, Kamenev and, finally, his own brother Lazar. This was not good for anything, so by the decision of the party, Mikhail was appointed to the post of director of the aviation plant, where he would have been at least a little happier."
kaganovich.4.a:0 "Well, every family has one black sheep."

kaganovich.5.t:0 "No Happy-End"
kaganovich.5.d:0 "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that today at 6 o'clock in the morning his brother Mikhail, the director of the aviation plant, was found shot dead in his own office at the plant. Despite the fact that there are no clear reasons for what he did there so early, forensic experts agree that Mikhail did not leave the plant in the evening. Left alone with an expensive foreign cognac, Mikhail drank a bottle, and, being in an extremely intoxicated state, took a gun out of his pocket.

He also wrote about how great it was for him to live in exile in France and that he is very sorry that he returned to his homeland.

Back in the 1920s, with the assistance of the German company Siemens Bauunion, the Kerensky government was able to find funds for the construction of the first line of the Moscow subway. The line stretches from Ostozhenka Street to the square of Three Railway Stations. Following the plan drawn up by the Germans, Lazar Kaganovich, together with Gosplan, built new sections of the Moscow metro in record time. The new line stretched from Bryansky Railway Station to Kursky Railway Station through the center of the capital, passing under Red Square, where a huge transfer hub was built for the third line - from Rzhevsky Railway station to Saratovsky Railway Station.\n\nThis is not the end of Kaganovich's renovation, as a huge plan was made for the renovation of Moscow - watering its rivers and landscaping.

nkvd.37.d:0 "Cheka revealed a whole system of national communities engaged in the promotion of Finno-Ugric nationalism. According to the investigation, the communities aimed to create a single Finno-Ugric state under the protectorate of Finland and Germany. The accused were Udmurt poet Kuzebay Gerd, Mari poet Olyk Ipay, Komi teacher Sandro Vago and Mordovian politician Zakhar Dorofeev.\n\nNone of the four accused admitted their guilt, which means that they did not repent of bourgeois nationalism and anti-Soviet rhetoric. They were sentenced to death by a special troika of the Cheka. Their case will serve as a lesson for the government of hostile Finland, which has seized Karelia, and for imperialist Germany, who are looking for a way to spoil our great Motherland."

nkvd.38.d:0 "Cheka revealed the creation of an underground organization of the so-called Volga-German Central Bureau. Its leaders planned the creation of a Volga-German state in Saratov and the former Pokrovsk under the protectorate of Germany and the Don Cossacks. Genrikh Schelhorn, Genrikh Koenig, Vladimir Dalinger and others were arrested in the case. All of them admitted that they tried to overthrow the Soviet government and create a bourgeois-nationalist state. All of them were put on trial and received a fair punishment: execution by firing squad."

The Cheka and the army already have very tense relations, but the existence of a military conspiracy threatens the stability of the country and the leadership of the party.\n\nWe must investigate this plot as soon as possible, otherwise we may encounter the generals ' rifles and tanks in Red Square.

nkvd.42.t:0 "Case of Zhukov"
nkvd.42.d:0 "If the party has decided that the army has finally been cleared of traitors and anti-Soviets, then this is a delusion. The Cheka believes that General Zhukov, a young but ambitious military figure who in fact played a significant role in the restoration of Soviet power and the power of the Bolshevik Party, is also involved in the conspiracy. Many people can hardly believe that the seemingly only person in Russia who was able to resist the pressure of conservative circles and lead the workers ' uprising is actually an enemy spy and traitor. However, the evidence of the Cheka, as always, is reinforced concrete:\n\nDuring the Civil War, Zhukov did not participate in the red movement, but preferred to sit out with a wound. He did not help Lenin's cause in any way, and soon after the end of the civil war he remained in Russia and served Kornilov and Denikin like any ordinary ordinary White Guard and traitor to the revolution. Despite the fact that he later led a rebellion against the power of the Kornilov military junta and united other pro-Soviet generals, his true views remain in question.\n\nThe investigation suggests that the Zhukov uprising was sponsored by the German and Japanese imperialists in order to weaken Russia. After all, after Zhukov came to power, the lands in Siberia, as well as Karelia, were lost. The prosecution also suggests that at the beginning of the war with Germany and Japan, Zhukov will be the first to betray socialism and engage in sabotaging the army and become the head of the military junta like Kornilov.\n\nZhukov denies all charges and declares his innocence. But is it worth believing such an unreliable person?"

nkvd.50.t:0 "Yagoda's Anti-Soviet Conspiracy"
nkvd.50.d:0 "Some party members, generals, and even Chekists believe that Genrikh Yagoda... he can't do his job. He is suspected of covert Bukharinism and his ideas of purging the army generals call into question his devotion to the ideas of socialism. It seems that Yagoda sees traitors of the people everywhere, but you need to be objective in this matter. In this regard, a number of people proposed to nominate Nikolai Yezhov, a young Cheka officer who had already proved his loyalty to the party and worked under Yagoda for many years, to the post of head of the Cheka.\nOn the one hand, by appointing Yezhov, we may be able to avoid mistakes, on the other hand, perhaps Yagoda is really right, and no matter how much we would like to admit the opposite, the party and the country are full of enemies of the people. In any case, the choice lies with the chairman."

nkvd.51.d:0 "With the appointment of Yezhov as head of the Cheka, a massive campaign began to purge the country of sabotage, enemies and traitors to the country. It seems that the fight against dissent has developed even more radically and widely than under Yagoda. Perhaps we should not doubt Yezhov, he has repeatedly proved his loyalty to the ideas of socialism, but it seems that Yagoda was right in many respects. If, in a time of universal lies, we decide that Yezhov is also involved in an anti-Soviet conspiracy, then we should appoint a more reliable person to this position, and Yezhov should be tried together with Yagoda as enemies of the people. This difficult choice falls once again on the chairman."
nkvd.51.a:0 "Yezhov will remain in his position."
nkvd.51.b:0 "Yezhov and Yagoda are both traitors!"

The young Chekist took advantage of the power granted to him and, with the help of armed detachments of the Cheka, liquidated [ROOT.GetLeader] and its entire government. Now the power belongs to the Cheka.\n\nYezhov, who was appointed chairman of the party and the new leader of the proletariat, will now rule the country with an iron hand. Well, we can only hope that by ridding and purging the country of all kinds of traitors, the workers and peasants will live in an absolutely protected country."
nkvd.52.a:0 "Long Live Chairman Yezhov!"

nkvd.53.t:0 "Military Take Over!"
nkvd.53.d:0 "It seems that Yagoda's repressions did not lead to anything good. The army, which rebelled because of the purges, seized power in the country by force. In the capital and major cities, there were armed clashes between the Chekists and the military, but it was the army that put the final point. Genrikh Yagoda was liquidated, and the Cheka was transferred to the army.\n\nThe old government was dismissed, and the military formed a provisional government to restore order in the country."

Under his wise leadership, we can be sure that our country will develop with great speed towards a beautiful future without traitors."
nkvd.54.a:0 "Yezhov will restore stability!"

nkvd.55.t:0 "Yagoda's Anti-Soviet Bukharinist Center"
nkvd.55.d:0 "The Central Committee of the RKP believes that all the facts revealed during the investigation into the cases of the anti-Soviet Bukharinist center and its supporters on the ground show that the Cheka failed in exposing these worst enemies of the people.\nThe traitors of the motherland — the Bukharinists and other double-dealers, in alliance with the German and Japanese counterintelligence, managed to launch wrecking, sabotage, espionage and terrorist activities with comparative impunity, to damage the cause of socialist construction in a number of industries and in transport, not only due to the shortcomings of the work of the party and economic organizations, but also due to the weak work of the Cheka.\n\nThe analysis of the arrests shows that the main blow of the State Security bodies was not directed against organized counter-revolutionary formations, but mainly at individual cases of anti-Soviet agitation, at all kinds of official crimes, hooliganism, domestic crimes, etc.As a result, alien and criminal elements penetrated into certain parts of the State Security bodies. A number of cases have been discovered in which even foreign intelligence spies managed to infiltrate State security agencies.\n\nThe same practice of an undivided attitude to the nomination of people, as well as the lack of political educational work, created conditions under which direct traitors-Bukharinists-found themselves in the leading Chekist work. Some of them systematically informed the members of the Bukharinist organization about the materials available in the NKVD about the anti-Soviet activities of the latter.\nHowever, the delay in exposing the anti-Soviet activities of the Trotskyist bandits is due not only to these general shortcomings in the work of the State Security agencies, but also to the specific criminal activities of certain responsible Cheka employees, and especially Molchanov, Firin, and Agranov. As a result of such poor management of the agency, there were many traitors among the latter. In the course of the investigation of the anti-Soviet Bukharinist center in Moscow alone, 65 agents of traitors were identified who systematically misinformed the State Security agencies, confused the whole case, and actively contributed to the unpunished activities of the Bukharinists.\n\nIn this regard, the party leadership considers it necessary to judge Yagoda's clique, namely, including himself, as well as Molchanov, Firin and Agranov, for obstructing the work of the Cheka and the creation of an anti-Soviet Bukharinist center in the state security bodies."

A generation will grow up that will know neither war nor famine - and will live in a world where everyone is equal, everyone gets what they deserve with their work."

nkvd.58.d:0 "Perfection is a nigh-impossible and ever-enticing goal that all true members of humanity strive for, all knowing that this unachievable ideal would likely elude them for life. Still, in the face of this likely failure, they endure, in the vain hope of being able to simply brush against greatness and catch a glimpse of divinity or true perfection. However, in our reformed and reforged Union, this ever-elusive ideal has not only been achieved but fully harnessed and embraced, and it is all thanks to the glorious Chairman Yezhov. \n\nUnder the calculated, towering, and imposing rule of our beloved Chairman, the Russian people have endured great hardships and struggles, and for their sacrifices, our nation has been rewarded with true greatness as we emerge from our dark and corrupt past free and cleansed of sin, gracing true perfection under the Red Star of Bolshevism. The enemies of Russia, though numerous and unyielding, have been brought to the sword and Yezhov now guides our state down their river of blood to our new bright, crimson dawn. \n\nA perfect society has finally been forged on this imperfect and sinful Earth, righteously purged to be free from vice, desire, religion, need, and any other unseemly and craven traits and beliefs of lesser beings. The New Soviet Generation shall be the standard of the world as the true beacon of perfection and societal harmony, and under Chairman Yezhov, this generation shall be safeguarded at all costs as the pinnacle of humanity. All of Russia is safe and perfect under our glorious Chairman, and none shall rob us of this perfection as long as we still draw breath!"

The streets are clean, people are working and working for the good of the country, not for a fat capitalist.\n\nIt is almost a communist paradise, except that communism has not yet been built, but it will definitely be built in the coming decades, once the Red Army occupies Berlin and Vienna. In the meantime, Yagoda will continue to serve the Motherland faithfully, as he has all his life."

As an influential sailor and a man who can restore order with a firm hand, anarchists understand that this measure is necessary while society is still unstable and the army is a serious danger.\n\nPavel Dybenko will lead the country to a bright future of anarcho-communism, where every person is equal to another, and people are brothers! And if he dares to abuse his power, we must remember that our mother is anarchy, and no one has the right to rule over another person. And if the freedom of one ends where the freedom of the other begins, then Dybenko's freedom will end very quickly."

He remained committed to the ideas of anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism to the end, and he took the loss of Makhno and the repressive anti-anarchist policies of the Bolsheviks very hard. He followed him to France, where he became a close ally and collaborator.\n\nNow that the flag of the Central Bank is flying over Russia, Petrichenko has returned to take power from the hands of the usurper Dybenko. He publicly declared that Dybenko is not an adherent of anarchism and established himself as a notorious scoundrel, a Bolshevik brawler. The memory of Petrichenko and his anarchist commune is still alive among the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, as is the memory of who Dybenko is.\n\nDybenko, being already a representative of the Central Bank and Free Russia, was drunk and rowdy. Among anarchists, there was an opinion that Dybenko, indeed, is not suitable for the role of leader, and that his behavior discredits anarchism. Petrichenko's popularity is growing every day, and the anarchist communes have nominated him instead of Dybenko to represent the anarchists of Russia abroad. As in the case of Dybenko, his role will be nominal, but maybe it will be better when we are represented by a recognized anarchist, and not some Bolshevik drunkard and murderer?"

And it made sense.\nFor centuries, ordinary people were robbed: first by the tsars, then by the capitalists, and other exploiters. Their so-called property was looted illegally, because they used violence against others. They should no longer own it, and now it's national property! Everyone has the right!\n\nLoot the looters, people! Take it as your personal property and use it. There's nothing wrong with taking it back. And so it will be until all the property stolen over the years by the capitalists becomes public property"
tsentrobalt.5.a:0 "That's fair."

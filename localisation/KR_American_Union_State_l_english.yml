TEX_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party\n§LThe liberal democrats in the region desire a reunion with the pro-democratic factions of America at once if possible, only agreeing to work with the AUS to stop more radical factions.

TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party\n§LThe America First Party is a populist-American broad tent made up of those who follow a laborist, patriotic ideology and also generally view left socialism as being unpatriotic or totalitarian. They stand in opposition to other progressives by their reliance on political machines, their Share the Wealth Plan, relative cultural conservatism, populist-messaging, party militias and, more than anything, their personalism based around Louisiana Governor and firebrand Huey Long. As such they preach an odd mixture of radicalism, populism and pragmatism in order to enact a pro-labor and pro-famer capitalist nation united around the American identity.§!"

TEX_christian_party:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_long:0 "Christian Party\n§LThe CP has largely absorbed conservative populists and former democrats, united by populist proposals of patriotism, universal employment and a minimum income for citizens. The Party also emphasizes its military wing, strict constitutionalism, anti-socialism and cultural supremacism alongside Pelley's esoteric ideas. As such the group is extremely divisive, not helped by its radical-wing being overtly racialist and authoritarian, with many unsure how far Pelley would go to appease them.§!"

Coined the Holy American League after the war, there is little the League does NOT do. Everything from building homes for the poor to training Catholics in the art of self defense. With the success of the New Gunpowder Plot, governing can be added to that list. Since coming power, the League has begun to implement Integralism throughout America. If the League can succeed in it's crusade to bring Political Catholicism to one of the most protestant nations on earth is a question that only God or time will be able to tell.§!"

To the Hardliners themselves, they are vessels of God and the Holy Mother who carry out their work in protecting the Empire from sin and heresy. With the death of the Archregent, it is an open secret that they seek to consolidate power and cast out their rival factions, lest the Empire fall once more head first into the rotting pit of Masonic Liberalism. To them, the Empire has already strayed too far from Christ into the dangerous realm of secularism, and it is their mission to reaffirm the Empire as the tool of the Church to bring salvation from fiery Gehenna to all souls, even if that means taking a life. Indeed, their leader, Father Leonard Feeney, is an ambitious and devoted man, only time will tell what lengths the Hardliners would be willing to go to save the Empire.§!"

Commanded by the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, Martin Carmody, the Neo-Feudalists are still shrouded in mystery. What is known is that most of the Knights of Columbus is extremely loyal to their Supreme Knight, and that Carmody has established connections to many networks and groups within the Empire. In the few times Carmody has emerged from the shadows of heading the secret police, he has expressed a desire to bring feudalism to America. Many have dismissed this as the silly dream of a man stuck in the past, but with the power of the Knights of Columbus behind him, Carmody’s vision is no laughing matter. The other factions of the League must be alert, lest they be the targets when the Knights make their next move in their march to revive feudalism.§!"

Under the authority of Father Charles Coughlin, the Populists have done all they can to make their voice heard the loudest. Millions listen in as Coughlin speaks on the need for a return the populist policies of America First in order for the Empire to survive. This goal is a very popular one, as many citizens of the Empire look back on phrases like “Every Man a King” with fondness, and Coughlin’s words only help to stir up their nostalgia. The Populists also wish to curtail the powers of the Inquisition, with Coughlin and many others believing that the purges have become far too excessive. With their dual goals of “Holy Populism” and the cutting back of the much feared Inquisition, it is without question that the Populists are very popular, and certainly a force to be reckoned with.§!"

Sheen, the “Beloved Disciple” of the Archregent is determined to carry out Carroll’s vision as closely as possible. However, the faction also has the stated goal of moderating the Empire. Sheen claims this keeps to the Archregent’s will, as with his dying breaths he told Sheen to be his successor and to reform the Empire. Others, especially the Hardliners, have brought this into question, pointing out that only Sheen heard his final words and therefore no one else can confirm this final wish of the Archregent. Regardless, the Loyalist Faction marches on, determined to continue the glorious work that the late Carroll started.§!"

United under the banner of former New York Governor Al Smith, the Right-Reformist Faction pushes for a revived Free Market capitalism to be adopted as the Empire’s economic system, under he moniker, “Christian Capitalism.” Much like it’s left wing counterpart, Smith’s Right Reformists push for a democratization of the Empire, but with the more moderate end goal of bringing the federalist model back to the country. These aims have attracted many moderates and conservatives who wish for a return to a more liberal and laissez-faire system while not abandoning Catholic values. The faction’s supporters may be old-fashioned, but they are no less determined to bring a new era of freedom and prosperity to the Empire§!"

Supporting the Federalist and Capitalist proposals of Smith, while at the same supporting the less radical ideals of Day, the Christian Liberalists lack a uniting figure, and mostly exist as a way for Smith's more leftist supporters to have a voice. Unless Smith should come to power and decide to push for a more progressive approach, they are doomed to remain support on the sidelines.§!"

TEX_social_democrat_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Moderate Reformists Faction\n§LStanding as the middle ground between Day's more radical Catholic Anarchism and Smith's Christian Capitalism, the moderate reformers, led nominally by Bishop Bernard Sheil, seek to create a truly equal society. While the meaning of what an 'equal society' actually means differs from member to member, broadly speaking, it aligns greatly with Day's vision for the Catholic Empire, although without the Anarchist overtones. Despite standing as the middle ground, more often than not, the stalwart labor minded Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago has pressed the faction towards Day, while supporting Smith should Day's Anarchism become too fragrant. Due to this, should the Reformists win out, Sheil becoming Carroll's successor is a real possibility.§!"

TEX_radical_socialist_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Catholic Worker Faction\n§LThe left wing of the Reformist Faction(dubbed the Catholic Worker Faction) within the Holy American League has become increasingly prominent with the death of the Archregent. Under the leadership of Dorothy Day, the Left-Reformist Faction pushes for fully embracing distributist economics, gender egalitarianism, democratization and, most controversially, the decentralization of the Empire. Also controversial is the lack of a denial from the Faction regarding its constant accusations of anarchist and syndicalist sympathies. Despite its many detractors, it is an undeniable fact that the Catholic Workers have garnered immense popularity among the working class and female population of the Empire, and are undoubtedly a powerful force within the League.§!"

Now Kennedy and his followers, calling themselves the “National Cavaliers” have defanged the Holy American League, turning it into little more than pen-pushing, rubber-stamping yes-men to keep some shred of legitimacy. In actuality, the Empire has become a military junta in all but name. The Cavaliers call the shots now, and they have not hesitated to crush the “Enemies of Our Lady”— those that pose a threat to the junta. At the same time, Kennedy has promised a return to the stability and prosperity before the Archregent’s death, though the junta’s policy of putting the military first has led many to be skeptical that Kennedy will look after anything except his own goons and power. Even still, the people pledge their loyalty and hold faith that the Lord will guide Kennedy’s hand.§!"

Emboldened by the rise of Day's faction within the Reformers, as well as greatly inspired by her anarchist tendencies, these few are far between Anarcho-Syndicalists within the ranks of the League have mange to form a somewhat cohesive faction. Due to their small nature, and lack of figurehead other than Day who has not publicly comment on the faction's rise, unless Day herself wins the day, these last remnants of America's syndicalist movement shall remain in the shadows.§!"

Espousing a mixture of Browderite Communism, Catholic Orthodoxy with just a dash of 'Traditional American Values' these ChristComs seeks to use the powers of the Archregent to bring about their perfect society.

No faction would be the one to rule them all, instead, every faction would rule...partially. Aspects of the factions' doctrines have been incorporated into the new "National Salvation Decree", which outlines the new policies that will be observed by the Empire. It has been decided that the Congress in St. Mary's will remain as a permanent governing institution, based on the model of the Ecumenical Councils. Officially this Council is the "Council of Guadalupe", but the introduction of the National Salvation Decree has led to many dubbing it the "National Salvation Faction."

Despite their support for some socialist policies, they are ardently opposed to internationalism and globalisation. Even though their core grew out of the Quebecois Social Credit movement around the Catholic Pilgrims of Saint Michael and Louis Even, the Revolutionaries support certain policies advocated by the Protestants like William Dudley Pelley and his Silver Legion or even Dixiecrats and the former Old Democrats. As such, the Revolutionary Pilgrims are united by one goal, the complete overthrow of the system instituted by Archregent Day who they perceive to be a puppet of 'international banking jewry' and creation of a 'socially just' popular 'monarchy' for a collective populace bonded by their Western heritage. Most surprisingly to some outside observers, the 'White Berets' are also influenced by the populist rhetoric of Pierre Poujade.§!"

Texas has taken its rightful place as the leading American state, and its culture and values will surely have as profound of an impact on American culture as the Hillbilly Boys have in recent years. Though O'Daniel has his work set out for him, it seems that every American has heard the phrase "pass the biscuits, Pappy", a testament to his charisma and popularity.

TEX_minor_support_idea_desc:0 "In addition to our existing coalition, we have also won the support of smaller figures within the AFP, and with their help, we can govern the country effectively."
TEX_coughlin_support_idea:0 "Coughlin-Aligned Government"
TEX_coughlin_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Charles Coughlin in the new AFP coalition, and with his powerful following, we will have a more secure grip over the country."
TEX_smith_support_idea:0 "Smith-Aligned Government"
TEX_smith_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Gerald L.K. Smith in the new AFP coalition, and with his charisma, we will have a more secure grip over the country."
TEX_earl_support_idea:0 "Earl-Aligned Government"
TEX_earl_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Earl Long in the new AFP coalition, and with his ties to Huey Long and irresistable charm, we will have a more secure grip over the country."
TEX_bingham_support_idea:0 "Bingham-Aligned Government"
TEX_bingham_support_idea_desc:0 "We have decided to include Alfred Mitchell Bingham in the new AFP coalition, and with his passionate following and industrial plans, we will have a more secure grip over the country."
TEX_insurgent_america_idea:0 "New American Spirit"
TEX_insurgent_america_idea_desc:0 "With America recovering from years of devastation, and now under the careful hand of Alfred Bingham, the country can now begin its journey towards a new prosperity; a new America. This will begin, of course, with construction and infrastructure."
TEX_dewey_plan_idea:0 "The Dewey Plan"
TEX_dewey_plan_idea_desc:0 "The Dewey Plan, named after the legendary Bellamyist scholar, will aim to revolutionize education in the country. The main ideas of the plan are to make education into a more interactive affair, allowing students to participate in social reform given its new existence as a social institution. Further, Dewey's emphasis on education as a place to learn not only knowledge but how to live makes it clear that education will be much more pragmatic for generations to come."
TEX_nationalized_healthcare_idea:0 "National Healthcare System"
TEX_nationalized_healthcare_idea_desc:0 "With the emergence and solidification of a national healthcare system, Bingham's plans for a new America are one step closer to fruition. Workers will now have much less to worry about in their daily lives, children can take care of their parents, and new families can be encouraged to replenish the country's population."
TEX_production_for_use_idea:0 "Production-For-Use"
TEX_production_for_use_idea_desc:0 "Production-For-Use is by far the most important part of Alfred Bingham's vision. An ideal society, one that understands that there are abundant resources for everyone, operates not out of profit but out of demand. Production must be driven by what people need, not by what can make the most money. As a result, we will save wasted resources and have a more efficient and satisfied populace."
TEX_no_speculation_idea:0 "Honest Economic Practices"
TEX_no_speculation_idea_desc:0 "Speculation is a practice that has plagued the American people for too long. To ensure that wealth is more democratically spread, as Bingham and the late Huey Long desired, we must eliminate the greedy practices of bankers and the wealthy once and for all. With more wealth in the hands of the middle class and the poor, we can create a more just and honest economy."
TEX_true_democracy_idea:0 "True Democracy"
TEX_true_democracy_idea_desc:0 "True liberty is the economic liberty that a worker enjoys under socialism. Industrial democracy, held up by a harmonious consensus of people living in abundance, must power our new society. However, while community will be strong, so too will the sense of personality that each person will enjoy in this society; with more time on their hands and a more equal living condition, our people can explore themselves to the fullest, and the country will prosper as a result."
TEX_middle_classes_idea:0 "The Middle Class Mind"
TEX_middle_classes_idea_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is not property that drives class; it is psychology. For revolution to succeed in America, it must be tailored to the middle classes, whose support is paramount to our continued rule. However, this is not limited to the economic middle classes, but instead to all those who consider themselves a member of the middle class, which is a significantly larger part of society. By taking advantage of this identification, and uniting labor and the economic middle class, we can lay the foundations for a radical organization of society."
TEX_outflanking_capitalists_idea:0 "Outflanking the Capitalists"
TEX_outflanking_capitalists_idea_desc:0 "The first major step in Bingham's economic transformation is to have a vertical cross section of the economy that is operated on a production for use basis. First, the unemployed will be brought into this system, but after a year, admittance will be voluntary. The resources of our nation will be leased to the government from factory owners and empty lands, and we will begin our experiment."
TEX_socialist_efficiency_idea:0 "Socialist Efficiency"
TEX_socialist_efficiency_idea_desc:0 "With the first steps taken towards our new economy, we can now expand it to the rest of the nation. Economic resources, now in the hands of the government, can be used more efficiently for the prosperity of the country. With an increasingly planned economy, we will be more productive than ever before. However, we must take care to ensure we do not upset the middle classes we rely upon for support. As a result, we will not completely overhaul the economy, but the mere efficiency of our system will convince them to support it..." 
TEX_society_of_plenty_idea:0 "Society of Plenty"
TEX_society_of_plenty_idea_desc:0 "In our new society, there is no hoarding of resources. Instead, we can enjoy the natural abundance of resources in the vast country we live in, and wealth, both in resources and otherwise, will flow through our population."
TEX_tactical_patriotism_idea:0 "Tactical Patriotism"
TEX_tactical_patriotism_idea_desc:0 "To appeal to the masses of Americans, we must appeal to their patriotic and nationalistic instincts. While this may not be ideal for us, it is no crime to have pride in one's country, and if we want a sustainable revolution, we must pre-empty any would-be nationalistic challengers from stealing our base of support from under our noses. If our people are fighting for their country, they will be all the more motivated towards our cause. However, this patriotism may be hard to control at first..."
TEX_tactical_patriotism_two_idea:0 "Lure Em' In"
TEX_tactical_patriotism_two_idea_desc:0 "Now that we have established ourselves as a truly patriotic government, we can use this perception to our advantage. By continuing to foster nationalism amongst the people, we can build a socialist movement that will bring the country that nationalists so desperately want, and without the fear of being overthrown. We will pay special attention to the military and entertainment, such as films and sports, to continue cultivating this weapon." 
TEX_uncorrupted_government_idea:0 "Honesty and Government" 
TEX_uncorrupted_government_idea_desc:0 "Though it may sound like a joke to some and an impossibility to others, we are confident that one of the first steps to restoring our nation should be to create an honest government. To the extent it is possible, we should try to eliminate big business influence in our politics, and ensure that government is of, for, and by the people. Huey Long had his faults, but his dream of a government that serves the people must be realized!"
TEX_american_families_idea:0 "The New American Family"
TEX_american_families_idea_desc:0 "To continue our reforms in America, we must emphasize the role of the family. The family is the unit which keeps the country stable, the glue that keeps it united. Without strong families, we would be left with little. Let us give subsidies to our families and support the replenishment of our population."
TEX_christian_support_idea:0 "Christian Support"
TEX_christian_support_idea_desc:0 "Though we are pious in our cause, we have sometimes struggled to gain the support of the church. Huey Long was never one to appreciate their potential, so now, we must court them ourselves. Faith will be paramount for building a new America, and we must ensure that the Bible is followed in the daily lives of every American, so that a moral America can emerge!"
TEX_currency_reform_idea:0 "Currency Reform"
TEX_currency_reform_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey Long started the process of currency reform, we must continue it. The old ideal of greenback currency, which the National Progressives espouse, would be an excellent start to this reform, although it is unknown what form it will take after that. For now though, we must protect our farmers from greedy bankers and investors, ensuring they will be safe to live normal lives once more."
TEX_virtuous_america_idea:0 "The New Republic"
TEX_virtuous_america_idea_desc:0 "America, as a republic, was founded on sound values, but lost its way after decades of corruption and incompetent administration. Now, with Huey Long beginning the work of reforming the country and our government continuing that work, we can have a virtuous republic once more. Democracy has been restored, and the people rejoice with their newfound power!"
TEX_chicago_plan_idea:0 "The Chicago Plan"
TEX_chicago_plan_idea_desc:0 "Originating from the University of Chicago, the Chicago Plan aims to separate monetary and credit functions within the banking system, with the goal of eliminating the danger of banks not being able to pay back all of their loans. Ideally, the banks would neither create money nor affect the money supply, and instead, money would be nationalized. This will stabilize our economy and hopefully help us recover from our recent economic woes."
TEX_press_freedom_idea:0 "Restore Press Freedoms"
TEX_press_freedom_idea_desc:0 "One of the longest traditions in our nation is the freedom of the press. Under Huey Long's wartime administration, these freedoms were curbed, but we must restore them if we are to continue his vision for America. After all, a friendly media could do wonders for our popularity..."
TEX_afp_machine_idea:0 "The AFP Machine"
TEX_afp_machine_idea_desc:0 "During Huey Long's life, he was able to establish a powerful Longist political machine to help him retain power. Now that he is dead, however, we have been forced to seize control of this wide operation, so that we could use it to our own advantage across the country. With the political machine firmly in our grasp, we will control the entire nation for years to come..."
TEX_media_help_idea:0 "Media to the Rescue!"
TEX_media_help_idea_desc:0 "For decades, the newspapers have been a source of consternation and relief alike for politicians anxiously waiting to see if their campaigns could win the hearts and minds of voters. Now, with the advent of the radio, the media is more important than ever. With their support, we can drown out any opponent, domestic or foreign. We must ensure our control of this institution, for if we control the media, we will control the nation as well."
TEX_finish_industrialists_idea:0 "Subservient Corporations"
TEX_finish_industrialists_idea_desc:0 "For too long, this country has suffered under the control of greedy industrialists. It was always Huey's dream to end their outsized influence in America, and we must finish what he started. By nationalizing major industries and taxing the richest among their numbers, the industrialists can be brought to heel and our control will be solidified. Towards a new American economy!"
TEX_help_vets_idea:0 "Care for the Veterans"
TEX_help_vets_idea_desc:0 "Our veterans, the millions of men who have fought bravely for our side, must be taken care of. Huey Long certainly thought so; he never shied away from promising the veterans that they would be well compensated after the war, and would be among the first to see the realization of his vision of "Every Man a King". Now that he is gone, however, we must act on these promises. Through increased subsidies, homes, and more for our veterans, we can ensure stability and a happy population."
TEX_ending_poverty_idea:0 "An End to Poverty"
TEX_ending_poverty_idea_desc:0 "Perhaps the most important part of Huey Long's dream was the achievement of a country free from poverty. It would be a country where wealth was more fairly spread, where every man was a king in his own right. Though he perished before he had the time to see his vision to fruition, we have finished his work, and now, America stands strong once more. No longer shall we suffer the disease of poverty!"
TEX_earl_machine_idea:0 "Uncle Earl's Machine"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_desc:0 "Though Earl Long is Huey's brother and natural successor, his brother's political machine was by no means an easy thing to control, or acquire for that matter. Now that we have moved to secure it for Earl's cause, however, we are one step closer to securing our position as Huey's successor and the rightful government of the country. Now we just have to hold on to this machine..."
TEX_earl_machine_idea_2:0 "True Man of the People"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_2_desc:0 "Though Huey Long was famous for fighting for the people, it is in his brother Earl that the downtrodden American can find a true ally. Across the country, farmers, workers, and the homeless can all find a friend in Earl Long, who always preferred their company to that of perfumed politicians. His constant desire to be with his people has inspired new support for himself and his administration, and now we will reap the benefits of his charismatic, down-to-earth approach."
TEX_earl_machine_idea_3:0 "Loved by the People"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_3_desc:0 "Earl Long, now having built a name for himself and distinguishing himself from his older brother, can finally look with pride at what he has built. A political network; a network run by Earl and his closest allies, which now controls the nation. More importantly, though, Uncle Earl has ingratiated himself with the people, and with their resounding approval, can continue to fight for them as hard as they fought for him."
TEX_the_three_ps_idea:0 "Politicking, Plain People, and Pea Patch Farm"
TEX_the_three_ps_idea_desc:0 "Though he may come off as a simple but well-meaning politician to some, in reality, Earl Long is a master politician, rivaling his brother in his ability to whip up crowds and win supporters. Never one to enter political rivalries in the hopes of gaining the support of both sides, Earl Long has successfully navigated the vipers nest of the post-assassination government, and now can visit his beloved Pea Patch Farm in peace, mingling with hundreds of locals and travelers alike. His toil, both on his farm and for the country, has given us prosperity beyond our wildest dreams!"
TEX_retail_taxation_idea:0 "The Gas, Beer, and Retail Tax"
TEX_retail_taxation_idea_desc:0 "To help pay for some of our programs and to give our administration more funding for research purposes, we have decided to levy new taxes on gas, beer, and retail purchases. These may be unpopular at first, but at least our people will be better able to pay them..."
TEX_end_civil_service_idea:0 "End the Civil Service"
TEX_end_civil_service_idea_desc:0 "Since entrenched politicians nationwide, especially in the South, have given strong resistance to Earl Long and his reforms, Long has decided that he must take action. To strike the power of these politicians, he has declared an end to the Civil Service system, denying corrupt politicians their support base. Instead, patronage will be given from the president's office, and we will be all the more powerful because of it."
TEX_black_enfranchisement_idea:0 "Extend the Franchise"
TEX_black_enfranchisement_idea_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the First Civil War, many freed slaves hoped for the right to vote, and for a time, they enjoyed this right. However, the arrival of Jim Crow laws denied voting rights to African-Americans in large swaths of America, and now, this policy must end. Though Earl Long has often used the rhetoric of morality and liberalism on this issue, it is clear that the prospect of a new voting base also interests him, but who will complain?"
TEX_take_care_of_people_idea:0 "Food for the Needy"
TEX_take_care_of_people_idea_desc:0 "To gain further support amongst potential voters and to further Huey's vision of making "Every Man a King", Earl Long has decided to implement food programs to feed the poor and those in schools. This includes a free lunch program and efforts to ensure that the most impoverished parts of our country are at least somewhat fed. With that accomplished, we can look forward to a more productive workforce and a higher morale for our population overall." 
TEX_take_care_of_people_2_idea:0 "Better Hospital Care"
TEX_take_care_of_people_2_idea_desc:0 "To Earl Long, taking care of the people must involve giving them adequate hospital access when they are sick or injured. The state of hospitals in rural Louisiana, and the rest of rural America for that matter, is abysmal to say the least. With a focus on modernized hospitals, in rural areas and elsewhere, we can ensure that our people will at least be able to get the care they need. Though Huey Long perished from his assassination injuries, Earl Long reasons, the hospital he was taken to did its best to save him, and that should be the standard for anyone." 
TEX_christian_renewal_idea:0 "Fourth Great Awakening"
TEX_christian_renewal_idea_desc:0 "As part of his program to rebuild the country after the devastation it faced in the past decade, Gerald K. Smith hopes to create a Fourth Great Awakening in the country. Taking inspiration from the previous three movements, there will be a resurgence in Christians, particularly Protestants, as Americans remember the faith that once guided them through even the hardest of times. With their faith renewed, our people can begin to heal."
TEX_christian_renewal_2_idea:0 "Family Support Plan"
TEX_christian_renewal_2_idea_desc:0 "Families are the cornerstone of our nation, and though Huey Long did his best to support them, we must continue his work. Subsidies will be given to devastated families and couples, especially those of veterans and other loyal citizens, in the hopes that they will be encouraged to have more children."
TEX_christian_renewal_3_idea:0 "New Longist Disciples"
TEX_christian_renewal_3_idea_desc:0 "Though Gerald K. Smith loved Huey Long like few others could have, he believes it is crucial that we do not forget him. The younger generation, too young to understand Huey Long's message at the time and now growing up into a world without him, should be taught about his deeds, and we should ensure that Smith is viewed as the heir to his movement. With the support of this new Longist and Christian youth, we will create an America that would make Huey proud."
TEX_christian_renewal_4_idea:0 "American Morality"
TEX_christian_renewal_4_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey Long was of course right to see part of the source of America's rot in its greedy businessmen and inhumane treatment of the poor, part of the cause was also a decline in morality. Throughout the past decade, marriages and families alike declined, and crime racked the country. Now though, with Smith finishing the Share the Wealth vision of Huey Long, we have restored morality to the country once more."
TEX_smith_veterans_idea:0 "Smith's Veterans"
TEX_smith_veterans_idea_desc:0 "During the Civil War, Smith built a fierce reputation as a military leader, beloved by his men and feared by enemies on all sides. Now that the war is over, a large contingent of our veterans feel a sense of loyalty towards Smith. If the need arises, we will be able to call these men up once more to defend their country and Smith's movement. With their help, we will not be defeated!"
TEX_masses_propaganda_idea:0 "Propaganda for the Masses"
TEX_masses_propaganda_idea_desc:0 "With a reputation as perhaps the most charismatic man on Earth, Gerald K. Smith has decided to continue his rousing speeches to the people, reminiscent of Huey Long's old barnstorming speeches. The speeches are meant to gather more support for Smith's policies, increase his own popularity, and even inspire the people. Using the greatest tool at his disposal, Smith will bring America towards a new age of prosperity."
TEX_new_silver_idea:0 "Remonetized Silver"
TEX_new_silver_idea_desc:0 "In a bid to jumpstart the economy, continue Huey Long's policies, and shore up his own support, Charles Coughlin has declared the remonetization of silver. With a silver-backed currency, the economy will be more stable, allowing us to increase the money supply as needed. With these new resources, we can take care of all Americans."
TEX_new_silver_2_idea:0 "Tax Relief for the Poor"
TEX_new_silver_2_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey was right when he demanded the wealthy pay their fair share, we must give relief to the underprivileged parts of the country. It is the Christian thing to do, and it is an excellent political move as well: as long as we have the people on our side, we will be safe from threats inside and out. Further, Coughlin hopes that giving relief to the poor will allow them to spend this newfound money, and the economy will boom as a result. Taking care of our people is taking care of our country."
TEX_new_silver_3_idea:0 "Efficient and Honest Government"
TEX_new_silver_3_idea_desc:0 "A problem that Huey Long's government shared with the old government in Washington is that it was bloated and corrupt. We must streamline our day-to-day tasks and cut unnecessary programs, so that we operate a more responsible economy and country. If we can manage all of this, we will be one step closer to Coughlin's vision of what a true government should be."
TEX_new_silver_4_idea:0 "Liberty of Conscience"
TEX_new_silver_4_idea_desc:0 "Although the state has a large role to play in Coughlin's plans for America, it will not be allowed to overstep into people's lives. We must give our people the liberty of conscience that they live in a righteous and moral nation, a nation that will help them when they falter and leave them alone in prosperous times. We will follow the principles of Social Justice and ensure that all can follow their chosen avocation in life."
TEX_wealth_conscription_idea:0 "Wealth Conscription"
TEX_wealth_conscription_idea_desc:0 "In these times of crisis, we must enact a conscription of wealth on the nation. The wealthy must contribute to the defense and the rebuilding of the nation from its smoldering ruins, and through our new wealth, we can afford many necessities that would be out of our reach otherwise. New research can be conducted, resources gained, logistics secured, and with these factors, we will have a stronger nation than ever before!"
TEX_national_sermons_idea:0 "National Sermons"
TEX_national_sermons_idea_desc:0 "Before Coughlin was ever in power, he gave radio speeches to his nationwide audience, with millions listening to his political rants. Now that we hold power and legitimacy, we can use this radio history to our advantage. Coughlin will continue to sermonize on the radio, making the case for his policies and acting as a moral guide for our people. The radio is a powerful tool at Coughlin's disposal, and he will use it wisely."
TEX_our_economy_idea:0 "Our Economy"
TEX_our_economy_idea_desc:0 "Now that we have broken the financial slavery we suffered under various shadowy financiers, we can use our economy as we see fit. New factories and resources are now fully under our control, and keeping with his usual rhetoric, Coughlin promises a more efficient economy than ever before!"
TEX_christian_capitalism_idea:0 "Christian Capitalism"
TEX_christian_capitalism_idea_desc:0 "Though Capitalism must be reformed, the most important thing is ensuring that the true principles of Christianity are followed. We will care for the poor, and though Capitalism will still exist, the wealthy will be strongly encouraged to engage in philanthropic practices. By keeping a careful eye on the corporations and ensuring the people are moral and happy, we can get our economy back on track."
TEX_exalt_humble_idea:0 "Protect the Humble"
TEX_exalt_humble_idea_desc:0 "Many of our people still face poverty in the aftermath of the destructive Civil War. To combat this, we must emphasize them as the group that we will legislate for, and by uplifting the humblest among us, we will uplift the entire nation. Though we are focused on the poor, we will take care to not target the wealthy too much, but they will pay their fair share. With everyone pitching in, we will move forward into a new age."
TEX_punish_wealth_idea:0 "Punish Greed"
TEX_punish_wealth_idea_desc:0 "If our reforms are to succeed, we must break the power of monopolists and industrialists once and for all. These are the same groups that fought against Huey Long's reforms, and with their wealth, we will be able to benefit the entire nation. This is a fact that the wealthy are unable to grasp; their focus on the short-term blinds them. We must punish them for their short-sightedness and greed and ensure that America is a nation for all its people, not just those at the top."
TEX_ban_unions_idea:0 "Hardworking Americans"
TEX_ban_unions_idea_desc:0 "Rather than having our people join unions, we will place an emphasis on hard work over all else. America has always been known for its work ethic, and to complete the vision of Huey Long, we must utilize this quality."
TEX_loyal_unions_idea:0 "Loyal Laborers"
TEX_loyal_unions_idea_desc:0 "The important thing in the conflict between capital and labor is loyalty. With industrialists weakened already, we should now turn to the unions, and ensure their loyalty. During the Civil War, many of these unions sided with the CSA, but those that sided with Huey Long are now among the most powerful in the country. Their loyal support means that we do not have to worry about factory sabotage or inefficient work; the unions will do their work, as negotiated, and we will be all the better for it."
TEX_subsidized_unions_idea:0 "Subsidize the Workers"
TEX_subsidized_unions_idea_desc:0 "A happy worker is a productive one, and to ensure our workers are happy, we must make their voices heard. Through an official endorsement and subsidization of unions, our government can bring them firmly to our side, while simultaneously making sure they are powerful enough to challenge corporations."

Over the years however, the Knights began to shift from only an insurance company to a Catholicism Advocacy Group. It was with the Holy American League's blessing that the Knights now take yet another role. The order has been militarized! All Knights of Columbus are now sworn to protect Holy Mother Church, her teachings and her priests by force of arms. As America is now being more and more integrated with the Church, the Knight's oath now leads them to protect and serve our government, to the death if Our Lord wills it."

TEX_Devers_plan2:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan2_desc:0 "The first step in Devers's plan to reform the military is to take a tally of the officers deserving of promotion for heroism and those deserving of demotion for wasteful actions. Those deserving will be recalled to the capital to meet with our new suppliers."
TEX_Devers_plan3:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan3_desc:0 "The second step for Devers is to assess the state of the forts and weapon stocks scattered across the country. Equipment that is in need of repair or is deemed too dangerous will be removed and recycled."
TEX_Devers_plan4:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan4_desc:0 "With the officers now informed and our weapons stocked, it is time for Devers to arrange the order of battle around the national strategy. This may disappoint generals who enjoyed abusing their authority to make risky manoeuvres, but this is progress."

TEX_Devers_plan5_desc:0 "With Devers' reforms finished, our army now stands at the forefront of military tactics and organization, with an expanded logistical service and the latest in force weaponry, we will be able to respond to any threat, no matter how many enemies they send after us."

TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_2:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_2_desc:0 "The next step in the Terrible Terry plan is concerned with organizing our troops further. Specifically, he hopes to emphasize cavalry. This will allow us to plan better against our enemy, and see what they are planning before we arrive on the battlefield."
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_3:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_3_desc:0 "Terrible Terry does not want to repeat the predictability of Weltkrieg generals. He prefers his enemies to know as little about his tactics as possible, and in the pursuit of that goal, has aimed for an unpredictable strategy. Such a strategy has several benefits for our troops.

TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_4:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"

TEX_lighning_joe_idea_4_desc:0 "If our artillery can be coordinated with other areas of our army, and with each other, we can have a much more effective means of bombarding our enemy. We should work to ensure that this is the case, for our explosive power may just win us this war."

TEX_unite_afp_decisions_desc:0 "With Huey Long out of the picture, the AFP has become fractured, with a multitude of factions aiming to take over. If we want to heal the wounds inflicted by Huey's demise, we must work towards reconciliation with some of these factions."
TEX_reconcile_coughlin:0 "Reconcile with Coughlin"
TEX_reconcile_coughlin_desc:0 "Charles Coughlin has always had strained relations with [TEX.GetLeader], but this relationship has only worsened in recent weeks. With a powerful radio show and an intimidating following, Coughlin has never been the closest Huey Long confidant, instead more or less operating his own faction within the party. This has caused Coughlin some problems, and most of all, he has faced accusations of disloyalty. Regardless though, he wields a significant power base, and we would be wise to offer concessions in the form of a watered-down version of his 'Social Justice' plan."
TEX_reconcile_smith:0 "Reconcile with Smith"
TEX_reconcile_smith_desc:0 "Gerald L.K. Smith has sharply criticized [TEX.GetLeader] in the aftermath of Huey's demise, and most of our advisors speculate that this is because he expected to succeed his idol and lead the country in what he believes is Huey's vision. Others attribute his abrasiveness to a fear of being sidelined on the national political stage. Whatever the case may be, Smith is one of the most charismatic men in the country, and bringing him to our side would benefit us much more than eliminating him from politics altogether. However, Gerald L.K. Smith is not an easily tamed man, and to win his support, we will have to offer certain concessions, ranging from farmer subsidies to going after groups Smith alleges were involved in Huey's assassination."
TEX_reconcile_earl:0 "Reconcile with Earl Long"
TEX_reconcile_earl_desc:0 "Earl Long, lovingly dubbed 'Uncle Earl' by his nephew and his supporters, is no fan of [TEX.GetLeader], a fact he has made clear in rousing speeches following Huey's demise. Though he had a mixed relationship with his brother, Earl insists that he now represents the interests of the Long family, and winning his support could mean a certain degree of legitimacy in the eyes of many. Further, Uncle Earl brings some talents of his own; he is a captivating storyteller, and an excellent orator beyond that. Most of all though, hidden behind his veneer of plainness, he is a shrewd political actor. We would do well to have his sharp mind on our side, before another group wins his loyalty."
TEX_reconcile_bingham:0 "Reconcile with Bingham"
TEX_reconcile_bingham_desc:0 "Alfred Mitchell Bingham leads a peculiar group, ranging from Bellamyists to Socialists to Technocrats, and everything in between. Whatever their preferred labels may be, however, none are too fond of [TEX.GetLeader], and this is not surprising. After all, their fringe wing of the AFP is rarely represented in party affairs, and we have done little to change that. However, if we wanted to seek out their support, we could give certain concessions in the form of leniency for some of the more left-wing traitors in the former CSA and PSA. Further, they would want us to continue what Huey started in public ownership of industries, going beyond his plans for it, or perhaps to act on healthcare and once and for all establish a national insurance system."

It is thanks to our new Washington, Huey Long, that this could be achieved. With Long at the helm, nothing is beyond our reach. We shall overcome poverty and make America the nation it was always meant to be. Every man a king!"

TEX_reconcile_the_left:0 "Reconcile the Left"
TEX_reconcile_the_left_desc:0 "We can never excuse the CSA's attempt to overthrow the American Constitution or their embrace of anti-American syndicalism, but the grievances of the workers that were fooled into supporting them are fair. We should appeal to the Independent Leagues and AFL, whom desire economic reform. We know they wanted to work with Huey even before the war, but the most extreme radicals made a ceasefire the best offer we could provide. We will now bleed support from these same radicals."
TEX_afp_alone:0 "AFP Alone"
TEX_afp_alone_desc:0 "Compromise. That was the word used by useless politicians who nearly handed our country over to extremists. The AFP and the nation more generally is not going to go out of its way to appeal to any of the factions that aligned themselves against the American Union State.

TEX_reconcile_the_right:0 "Reconcile the Right"
TEX_reconcile_the_right_desc:0 "There is no mistake that the political right made mistakes in supporting either the Feds or Murray. However their pro-American values and defense of capitalism against syndicalism is admirable. Besides, their machines are too large to hit head on. Instead, we should co-opt them with appeals to the cultural conservativism and anti-socialist populism, opening the way to taking the South."

The Union made a terrible and costly mistake in bothering to oppose it after the Civil War, one we should not repeat.

TEX_a_new_solid_south_desc:0 "The Southern Democratic machine lost the war and as a result learned its place under Long. They are already making appeals to support him on the national level if allowed to maintain their machines in the South and given some autonomy.

TEX_christian_party_victory:0 "Christian Party Victory"
TEX_christian_party_victory_desc:0 "In an outcome that has shocked both the nation and onlookers abroad, Huey Long and the America First Party have lost the first elections in America since the conclusion of the civil war.

TEX_defend_democracy:0 "Defend Democracy"
TEX_defend_democracy_desc:0 "Before his election, the President was called many things. A legionnaire, a syndicalist, a populist tyrant, and so much more. Yet he has always claimed to be dedicated to upholding the American republic and the values on which it was founded. We shall implement a judicial bill that will affirm our commitment to trial by jury and the powers of the court, and increase penalties for corruption."
TEX_organize_new_elections:0 "Organize New Elections"
TEX_organize_new_elections_desc:0 "Despite the steady rebuilding of our great nation, some express concern that the AFP was more concerned with its own power than with restoring America.

TEX_fight_the_terrorists:0 "Fight the Terrorists"
TEX_fight_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Despite the end of the civil war, fighting has not entirely ceased. Ideologues still cling to their beliefs and occasionally strike at us before slinking back into the shadows.

America is no place for cowardly traitors!"
TEX_reform_the_fbi:0 "Reform the FBI"
TEX_reform_the_fbi_desc:0 "It was inevitable that government agencies like the FBI would be shattered by the civil war. Despite their hostility to Pelley in the 1930’s the President sees the need and utility of such an organization. Once freed from the grip of Hoover and his gang of sycophants and given proper oversight, they will help ensure the wellbeing of the republic and the upholding of our great laws!"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism:0 "Outlaw Syndicalism"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc:0 "The SPA’s attempt to destroy our nation has cemented President Pelley's suspicions that these traitors cannot be allowed to legally spread their filth. Effective immediately, all Marxist, Syndicalist, Bolshevist, and other vocal revolutionary left groups will be considered seditious and effectively outlawed. Some may complain that this is deeply authoritarian, but sometimes such measures are needed."
TEX_political_rehabilitation:0 "Political Rehabilitation"
TEX_political_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Despite the inherent evil of their leaders, do we not see that the average syndicalist is simply a man who wishes to have bread on his table? Thus we will direct the Department of Justice to begin drafting lists of currently imprisoned (non-leading) radicals and offer them clemency in return for a renunciation of their former beliefs and a written statement to never again support such causes."
TEX_national_command_structure:0 "National Command Structure"
TEX_national_command_structure_desc:0 "Despite our recent political success, infighting is abundant within the Legion. Local commanders complain of inconsistent orders, accountants skim off the top, and desertion is increasingly commonplace. This is unacceptable and damaging, not only to the Legion, but to America as a whole. The President will call a meeting of top Silver Legionaries to formalize a better command system."
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety:0 "Build Silver Lodges"
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety_desc:0 "The Silver Lodges were a grand idea devised by Pelley and his top commanders before the Civil War. The idea would involve the Legion purchasing lands on which to build command centers, in-order to facilitate recruitment. With many Lodges destroyed in the fighting, we should further our commitment to the Legion and direct the treasury to allocate funds to units so that they may build new headquarters."
TEX_wrangle_congress:0 "Wrangle Congress"
TEX_wrangle_congress_desc:0 "Despite the Christian Party having won the election, President Pelley has still found our politicians to be a bickering and gridlocked sort. Whilst his legislation does pass, it often takes too much time and requires far too much politicking for Pelley's liking. The solution to this is clear; utilize the radio as our new platform and decry those shysters who would hold up America’s future for their petty games."
TEX_pdol:0 "Expand the Department of Labor"
TEX_pdol_desc:0 "Pelley gained most of his following from his radical economic proposals and the time has come to begin implementing these grand ideas. This monumental effort will begin with a vast expansion of the Department of Labor: in each and every county across our nation, a DoL office will be opened. This will set the groundwork for a truly staggering effort to transform the American economy."
TEX_universal_jobs_registry:0 "Universal Jobs Registry"
TEX_universal_jobs_registry_desc:0 "With the DoL properly expanded, in each county a grand registry of each business and every possible position will be compiled and paired with a list of every worker in that county. The work will be comprehensive, to say the least. The DoL will use this combination to ensure that every American can easily and quickly find work, and when a worker cannot find work in one county, the offices will cooperate and attempt to find jobs for all who need them."
TEX_the_silver_rangers:0 "Expand the Silver Rangers"
TEX_the_silver_rangers_desc:0 "The Silver Rangers are the law enforcement group of the Silver Legion. They work to ensure that dues are paid, regulations are upheld, and that the demeanor of the Legion is in line with what the Chief and President desires. Our government is growing more popular by the day, and it has become apparent that they will need a recruitment drive of their own, lest our whole organization implode in on itself."
TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "The Christian Commonwealth"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "The time has come for Pelley’s most grand idea to be put into motion. The Christian Commonwealth is a vast overhaul of the entire American economy into a hybrid system. In this system, private businesses can still exist, but they will all be subservient to and part of the Commonwealth Corporation. Furthermore all banks will be absorbed into a Central Treasury Bank which will be responsible for distributing credit."
TEX_annual_dividends:0 "Annual Dividends"
TEX_annual_dividends_desc:0 "With the Commonwealth system coming together the next ambitious step must be taken. In every county, a Treasury Bank will be opened and every native-born or naturalized American given an identification number and bank checkbook. From this moment forward, every American will be guaranteed an annual number of credits to ensure that none of our countrymen shall be subjected to the deepest depths of poverty."
TEX_gallahad_fellowship:0 "Galahad Fellowship"
TEX_gallahad_fellowship_desc:0 "Pelley's original Galahad College taught a wide variety of topics, including Christian economics, esotericism and Pelley’s Liberation Doctrine, which has since grown into Soulcraft. While the college closed during the civil war, Pelley has declared the time has come not only for Galahad College to be re-opened, but for the Galahad Fellowship to be formed and sister schools to be opened nationwide."
TEX_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
TEX_universal_education_desc:0 "Is it not imperative for a society that the next generation be well educated? The President certainly believes so. Pelley has introduced measures to guarantee that every American youth will be granted (depending on the student) either a college scholarship or enrollment in a trade school. The youth will praise our names and future generations will be better equipped to carry on our grand experiment."
TEX_referendum_voting:0 "Referendum Voting"
TEX_referendum_voting_desc:0 "It is time to introduce the CP's proposed reforms to the legislative system. Firstly, we shall allow voters to eject their congressman if they believe they have alienated their constituents. Next, we shall implement a final step in the legislative process where all congressional legislation must require the majority approval of voters it would impact."
TEX_a_better_america:0 "A Better America"
TEX_a_better_america_desc:0 "Though many feared what would become of America under our rule, we have achieved greatness. Every American has a stable income from the Commonwealth, our democracy has been expanded, and Christian values have been restored to their rightful place. To complete out goals we shall fully integrate the so-called "Wards" into the Commonwealth and re-introduce the traditional American Bill of Rights."

TEX_legacy_of_fighting_bob_desc:0 "Bob La Follette was the original inspiration for the National Progressive Party and supported the foundation of both Progressive Parties. We will pass the La Follette Bill in his name which will guarantee workers the right to unionize without fear of being fired."
TEX_peace_not_war:0 "People over Arms"
TEX_peace_not_war_desc:0 "Ensuring that the military growth we've seen in the past couple years would not destroy the Republic was one of our promises. It results in needless war and more MacArthurs, and we will see to it that this does not occur. We will shift current military spending to civilian contracts and our future education programs, for our governments stands for peace, not war."
TEX_wisconsin_idea:0 "The Wisconsin Idea"
TEX_wisconsin_idea_desc:0 "The ideal of all men being educated was a dream held by the Founding Fathers, but now it can be a reality. We will follow the Wisconsin Model and, after expanding current schools, fund higher education and trade schools so it costs next-to-nothing for qualified citizens to enter higher education."
TEX_modernized_congress:0 "Modernized Congress"

TEX_farmer_labor_alliance:0 "Farmer-Labor Organization"
TEX_farmer_labor_alliance_desc:0 "We must organize rural and urban workers so that they may intermingle, share mutual aid, and have a shared political lobby. We will campaign for more to join the Farmer-Labor Party and collaborate closely with it."
TEX_proportional_representation:0 "Proportional Representation"
TEX_proportional_representation_desc:0 "An idea long supported by Progressives such as George Norris and Bob La Follette, the first-past-the-post system of voting is badly outdated and encourages party corruption and machines. Proportional Representation must be campaigned for in each state, and the constitution will need to be reformed for such a voting system. This will occur when enough support is gathered, of course."
TEX_granger_coops:0 "The National Grange"
TEX_granger_coops_desc:0 "The National Grange is an honorable American institution that allows the rich and poor to mingle in rural communities and for the former to aid the latter. Encouraging rural mutual aid and farm support, we will have census employees help farmers register for the Grange and give it a grant to expand it."
TEX_plumb_plan:0 "The Plumb Plan"
TEX_plumb_plan_desc:0 "Named for Glenn E. Plumb's plan for cooperative railroads on a national level, the government will sell bonds and use them to purchase railroads.

Focusing on humane capitalism with a particular emphasis on supporting our workers and the lower classes without letting them be chewed up by the Capitalist machine, the famous oilman Marland and his Democrats envision a new America that embraces our pioneering legacy and frontiersmen culture out here on the Prairie while creating an equitable and profitable paradise for all Americans to enjoy. As Marland and his new Democrats rise to take the place of the Kingfish, the nation now waits to see if these humane capitalists can keep their promises."

Though his old Marland Oil Company was one of these eventual failures, gobbled up by J.P Morgan in the 1920s, with his newfound position of power, perhaps all that can finally change. Creating a new Marland Oil Company with deep ties to the state and our economy, while also expanding its operations to provide oil for most citizens in the nation, President Marland shall bring cheap and affordable to as many Americans as he can while rebuilding his fortune all over again."

American Capitalism shall be forcefully divorced from cronyism and monopolies, finally set free from these predatory practices that only seek to drain the common man of every last hard-earned dollar he has. The American economy at large will finally be able to embrace the true idea of liberal and free, humane and non-predatory Capitalism, ensuring that the American Dream is truly attainable for each and every soul in the Union."

All across America’s fringes, rival oilmen and monopolies still drive the prices up, gouging our innocent citizens who are just trying to stay warm and with power as they endlessly toil for the American Dream. We must put an end to this predatory form of Capitalism now! Though we do not have the power or authority to simply clean the slate of competition yet, we can create a new organization to combat these practices in the meantime. The Interstate Oil Compact Commission, or IOCC, shall rise to ensure each and every state in the Union obeys the idea of affordable oil, gas, and electricity for all. This pact, signed by the governors of 31 states so far, will ensure that as many Americans as possible can heat and power their homes cheaply without need for worry, while also conserving the national stockpile and assure that none goes to waste."

In order to combat this, new policies shall be passed to both help the unemployed survive in these hard times while also aiding them in their search to find work so that they may come to support themselves without government handouts. And as always, if some of these louts still cannot find stable work, there are always positions open at Marland’s own oil company should they need the extra push."

New parties spring up as old parties and alliances collapse, distrust and doubt still flows through the minds of the masses, and radicalism, though wounded after the ACW, still seeps into every crack and crevice it can find. Even our own party of the Democrats has been affected by this divide, for the villains of the ODP are well known and hated, and their black mark continues to stain our image. We must take the first steps in rebuilding and repairing our once great Union, both physically as we begin a new period of Reconstruction and mentally or even spiritually as we work to mend the hearts and minds of the American people, for the world will not wait for this slumbering giant to awake for long."

Embracing the ideas and rhetoric solidified by the final product of this push - the beautiful 27-foot tall statue of bronze named ‘Confidant’ depicting the Pioneer Woman with her child - President Marland has moved to preserve the idea of frontier life and pioneer freedoms, especially in regards to our women. Ladies across America shall rejoice as they are finally given the voice and respect they deserve, raised to be equals alongside the rest of their fellow true Americans, for it was those women who carried the refinement, the moral character and spiritual force into the West. Additionally, a minor societal push for preserving pioneer and frontiersman lifestyles and cultural motifs will coincide with these liberalizing measures. The idea of the strong, self-sufficient, and matriarchal lifestyle at the boundaries of civilization and the true wild shall take hold in this new America as we leave behind the terrors of our recent past to embrace the culture that stood for decades as America was first truly built."

Filled with Dixiecrats, KKK sympathizers, elitist cotton kings, and other nogoodniks, the ODP and other off-shoots like them have sullied our good name for too long. Under President Marland, we will move to rebrand the Democratic Party as the new bastion of humanism and the beacon of fair Capitalism, baptizing our party anew in the holy waters of our restored Union’s birth and washing away the sins of the past."

This immunity from forced sale also guarantees the widow shelter should they need it, and ensures that they will not drown in the demands of their creditors.

Based upon the program he helped create along with the late FDR and Fiorello La Guardia during the 1920s, this Little New Deal will bring about a new age of Relief, Recovery, and Reform aimed at uplifting the American people and preventing another Great Depression. In order to ensure that radicalism never takes hold in America again however, this Little Deal shall be tempered by American ideas of Conservative Liberalism and humanist Capitalism, while also straying from the more radical policies that bordered on Socialism and Leftist populism that nearly tore our nation apart in the past."

Prosperity for some shall mean prosperity for all, even for the forgotten and the downtrodden, for President Marland aids all Americans in need, no matter their background."
TEX_always_fair_to_labor:0 "Always Fair to Labor"
TEX_always_fair_to_labor_desc:0 "Just like his father taught him, E.W. Marland has endeavored to always be fair to labor, for it was his father’s respect and aid to his own workers that prevented them from ever striking against his management. The working man may be lowly, but they are numerous and vital as well, and without them, no business or American nation could function. We will not make the same mistakes that led to the Second American Civil War and the Socialist unrest that fueled it. Our new economy and our new Union shall put the needs of the lower classes on the same plane of importance as all other matters of the state. No American shall be left behind, and no working stiff shall be forgotten, for the days of predatory Capitalism in America are finally over."

A new age of Democracy has dawned for the American people, and President Marland and his new Democrats shall be the heralds of this new glorious and liberty-fueled age. The Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave are finally back on track to bring Americanist paradise to all in this newly forged Union, and it is all thanks to President Marland."

TEX_oil_conservation_desc:0 "With the IOCC now including nearly every state in the Union, and with President Marland’s now unmatched authority and popularity, our administration is finally free to go ahead with Marland’s final plan for oil in America. The Marland Oil Company shall move to expand operations across the entire nation, expanding past even the boundaries of the current IOCC member states and even taking on some of the hated monopolistic practices used by our rivals, all for the greater good. Under this humanist ‘monopoly’, all shall be given a fair price, fair rates, and fair service, for all Americans deserve an equal and comfortable lifestyle no matter what their specific Governors or local politicians and business tycoons may think. Those predatory organizations and rival monopolies like Standard Oil that refuse to bend to our humane form of Capitalism shall be forced out of business by our better business sense, and all in America shall rejoice as the Black Gold flows cheaply from coast to coast, all thanks to President Marland."

Specialized in traffic enforcement and in preventing roadway crime, these new officers shall be ever ready and ever vigilant as they endlessly patrol the ever-expanding highways of our new Union.

With the success of the New Gunpowder Plot, the Church, and America herself, has been saved.

During the chaos of the civil war, many local chapters formed small militias to defend their homes, and the Church. With the formation of the Papal Militia, local KoC chapters in enemy territory formed small spy rings that greatly aided the efforts of the Militia and the wider Union State. With the reformation of the Militia into the Holy American League, these spy rings remained and actually became a codified part of the group under Supreme Knight Carmody. With Carmody himself now in charge of the FBI and the League in need of trustworthy agents, the government has moved to formally mobilize the Knights.

This quick rise is due in no small part to our banning of the largest Protestant confraternities, and with the Orange Order being fairly small, they were left alone. However, this was seemingly a mistake. The Orange Order, according to reports by the empowered Knights of Columbus, is the main body behind Protestant resistance to our rule. Indeed, it was allegedly the Orange Order that first suggested the concept of an Anti-Catholic Bill to Gerald L. K. Smith, who then presented the idea to Long himself. Due to this, the Orange Order has become public enemy number one of the Knights. Every member of the Order shall be found and held accountable.

However, he made the mistake of allowing those in opposition to the Holy American League to remain not only legalized, but within the very halls of Congress. This mistake has led to rapid attacks on the state and its legitimacy, leading to massive disunity within the nation. However, a solution to this problem has finally materialized! By applying pressure via the Knights of Columbus and empowering the right people, we can effectively puppet the remaining parties. Not only will this give us an even more free hand in our righteous reconstruction of America, but when the people see us working side by side with those who oppose our rule, our popularity among them can only increase, a win-win situation."

While the Klan has been targeted by us even before our rise, they have remained a constant annoyance, if not a threat. With the head of the snake finally cut off, the dream of many an African-American and Catholic can finally come to pass. The remaining Klan shall be hunted down and defeated! We shall not rest until the very notion of the Klan is exercised from the American psyche. When we are done, it can finally be said that the Klan will truly have been cremated. "

To that end, Liberalism itself shall be banned, and all entities that promote it shall be infiltrated and brought down from the inside.

While differing practically from Lusitanian Integralism with only a few key points. In theory Guadalupism is an apolitical ideology combining aspects from across the Catholic world, with a heavy emphasis of Pan-Americanism and the spreading of Catholicism.

Those who fought for the King and his attempts to allow the free exercise of the One True Faith overtime adopted the term Cavalier to describe themselves. The cavalier identity, one of gentlemanly conduct, standing for God and Country, is an identity that our government must push the American people to adopt. By extolling these men as heroes, not only can we begin the process of creating a true cavalier identity among our people, we can also paint the Canadians and their royalist exiles as usurpers, giving both the American Revolution and our instating of a Monarchy more legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

TEX_distributism_desc:0 "With our control unchallenged and Catholics being empowered, we are almost ready to achieve total economic independence and finally rid ourselves of our foreign lifelines. However, a debate has sprung up that has reached the highest echelons of our government regarding exactly what our form of economics should be. Dorothy Day has outlined her support for “Distributism”, a theory which wishes to spread the means of production as far as possible, which has garnered support from Catholic Workers but has been compared to Syndicalism. Al Smith on the other hand has outlined his “Christian Capitalism” plan, which is exactly what it sounds like, this plan has garnered support as well but has been compared to the vile Liberalism that destroyed old America. The debate has reached Regent Carroll, but the question is, what will he choose?"
TEX_catholic_unions:0 "Sponsor Catholic Unions"
TEX_catholic_unions_desc:0 "Dorothy Day has offered her aid in setting up Catholic Unions which will be under our guidance, they will promote the faith while also making sure that workers still have a voice. With the Church famously promoting Unions as a method for workers to ensure their rights, this comes as no shock. Catholic Social Teaching will finally find its home in America, a goal of many Catholics in politics since the inception of the concept. "

TEX_common_man_monachism_desc:0 "While we have done much to promote Catholicism within America, to much success, our political ideology of Integralism has remained rejected by and large by the wider public. Indeed, while Catholicism may be on the rise, Integralism, even under the guide of Guadalupism, has failed to attract adherents. To solve this, the government of Regent Carroll has moved to introduce what they are calling ‘Common Man Integralism.’ In essence, Common Man Integralism breaks down the ideals of Integralism and combines it with Longite populism. After all, Long was for the common man, and so are we, just with a much stronger emphasis on religion. "
TEX_blur_the_lines:0 "Blur the Lines"
TEX_blur_the_lines_desc:0 "The Separation of Church and State was perhaps the greatest crime of the so-called Enlightenment. Since the collapse of the Roman Empire, when Holy Mother Church single handedly rebuilt society from the ground up, Church and State were intertwined. In order to finally sound the death blow of Enlightenment thought within America, the Church shall be placed at the centerpiece of society. Bishops shall be granted temporal power, just as many priests shall be granted ranks within the government itself. In short order, Church and State shall be wed once more, even despite what the Founding Fathers’ had intended."

TEX_finish_industrialists:0 "Finish the Industrialists"
TEX_finish_industrialists_desc:0 "The overmighty industrialists who once ruled this nation are on the run, and we must finish them off. No longer will they have undue influence over America; while they can still exist, they will never dominate the government again. By sweeping the rug from under them, the industrialists, loyal or not, will no longer have the power to control our economy, and all Americans will be better off."
TEX_eliminate_poverty:0 "Eliminate Poverty"
TEX_eliminate_poverty_desc:0 "Poverty is like a plague on American life. For our existence, it has been unrelenting, always creeping into the lives of our poorest citizens. This will no longer be the case, and with careful measures to ensure an end to staggering wealth inequality, we will finally wipe out this disease."
TEX_democratic_transition:0 "Democratic Transition"
TEX_democratic_transition_desc:0 "Now that Huey Long is gone, we must continue his work of reforming the country and establishing a healthy democracy. One hurdle to this will be in deciding how we will lead the AFP moving forward, and what policies we pursue. Regardless, however, all Americans can rest easy in the knowledge that their government will now work for them."
TEX_honest_government:0 "Honest Government"
TEX_honest_government_desc:0 "One of the biggest factors that drove the nation to civil war was a lack of trust in the corrupt government. The people were right to be wary; the government was, after all, taking advantage of them and serving only a small group of interests. Now, we will ensure that the government can be held accountable to those it is meant to serve: the people."
TEX_rural_schools:0 "Rural Schools"
TEX_rural_schools_desc:0 "Huey Long planned to invest more in new schools, especially for the rural areas that need them so badly, after the war. However, now that we are in power, we must bring this plan to fruition. By building better primary schools and perhaps even universities in the rural areas of our nation, we can better educate the next generation, and also help those areas recover."
TEX_chicago_plan:0 "The Chicago Plan"
TEX_chicago_plan_desc:0 "The Chicago Plan was originally drafted by the University of Chicago, and endorsed by AFP politician Bronson Cutting. The plan would see banks separate their monetary and credit functions, creating a full-reserve banking system. In practice, this would make it so that banks have enough money to cover their loans. Further, as Irving Fisher has put it, it would "nationalize money, but not banking"."
TEX_new_american_family:0 "The New American Family"
TEX_new_american_family_desc:0 "A task we must pursue if we want to create prosperity in America is supporting our families. The American family has been devastated in the past twenty years, and if we are successful in promoting their growth once more, we will have a growing population-and a larger pool of manpower to draw from."
TEX_currency_reform:0 "Currency Reform"
TEX_currency_reform_desc:0 "Huey Long understood that the currency needed some sort of reform if it were to function efficiently and fairly. We will act on this issue and make sure it is not the incompetent banks who handle this part of the economy, but us, and that perhaps a silver currency will be adopted rather than a gold one."
TEX_roll_back_censorship:0 "Roll Back Censorship"
TEX_roll_back_censorship_desc:0 "During the Civil War, Huey Long instituted certain policies of censorship on media and other institutions that were understandable at the time, but must now be rolled back. To have the newspapers on our side, we should show them that we will give them plenty of space to conduct their business as they see fit. With freedom of the press reinstated, we are one step closer to creating a new America."
TEX_reconcile_the_church:0 "Reconcile the Church"
TEX_reconcile_the_church_desc:0 "It is well known that Huey Long did not have the best relationship with churches, despite the best efforts of men like Gerald K. Smith and Charles Coughlin. Regardless, now that we are in power, we should make an effort to extend an olive branch to these organizations. We should not hope for direct endorsements, but if we can get them to sympathize with us at least, it will show that we truly are good Americans and only wish to bring some semblance of morality back to America."
TEX_a_virtuous_republic:0 "A Virtuous Republic"
TEX_a_virtuous_republic_desc:0 "A republic free of corruption is what the people call out for, and it is what they deserve. After the herculean effort of millions of brave AFP fighters, we stand ready to move forward as a new nation, inspired by the vision of Huey Long and with a government that serves the people."
TEX_the_people_yes:0 "The People, Yes"
TEX_the_people_yes_desc:0 "The populist vision for America, in which the hard-working common man is able to make a good living for himself and his family and all share in the prosperity of the nation, has finally come to fruition. We have brought changes into a world resenting change, and now, the tough will of the American people has paid off."
TEX_uncle_earl:0 "Uncle Earl"
TEX_uncle_earl_desc:0 "Earl Long, the estranged brother of the legendary Huey Long, has come to power, succeeding his brother and continuing what some are calling the Long Dynasty. Despite his familial ties to Huey, Earl has a lot to prove, and even if he does prove a worthy successor to Huey, he must make a choice: will he follow in Huey's footsteps, or implement his own vision for the country?"
TEX_fulfill_his_vision:0 "Fulfill His Vision"
TEX_fulfill_his_vision_desc:0 "Earl Long has decided that he must continue the work of his brother, a man he often agreed with, despite their tendency to argue with one another. In establishing what some are calling a "Long Dynasty", Earl has reassured worried onlookers that he hopes to finish Huey's plans and govern for as long as the people wish, though just how long that will be is yet to be seen."
TEX_world_class_highways:0 "World-Class Highways"
TEX_world_class_highways_desc:0 "Part of Earl Long's program to bring the country back from economic ruin is the building of a new national highway system. Plans for such a system have been in the works for years, but now we have the resources to finally make good on our promises. This will allow us to connect our vast nation like never before."
TEX_retail_taxes:0 "Retail Taxes"
TEX_retail_taxes_desc:0 "Earl Long is a practical man, and he understands that to pay for Huey's programs, we must implement higher taxation in some cases. For this purpose, it is proposed that a retail tax, as well as small taxes on gas, beer, and more, would give more than enough for these programs. It may be unpopular, but it will allow us more funding for important advances in research as well as our domestic programs for the people."
TEX_louisiana_politicking:0 "Louisiana Politicking"
TEX_louisiana_politicking_desc:0 "Despite seeing himself as Huey's natural heir, Earl Long still has many enemies. To eliminate or otherwise undermine these rivals, he wishes to engage in a what he calls "a little Louisiana politicking". This will involve challenging rivals with favorable candidates, denying party financial support to naysayers, and using the bully pulpit to keep dissenting politicians in line. Earl Long is a master at such strategies, and through his crafty maneuvering, we will have a stable AFP."
TEX_end_civil_service:0 "End the Civil Service" 
TEX_end_civil_service_desc:0 "The Civil Service makes life difficult for Earl Long. How could he accomplish his goals if he cannot fund the politicians responsible for voting? Instead of this system, we will encourage patronage, given by Earl Long chiefly but by allies as well, which will allow us greater control over politicians nationwide. Though some decry this as a blatantly tyrannical move, Earl has swatted such criticisms aside, noting that the politicians deserve it anyways."
TEX_the_earl_of_louisiana:0 "The Earl of Louisiana"
TEX_the_earl_of_louisiana_desc:0 "As the master of a resurgent America, Earl Long has achieved a status on par with his brother. His towering figure and warm charisma have led some to dub him the 'Earl of Louisiana', given his seemingly unshakable grip on the nation's government. For better or worse, Earl Long is firmly in the saddle."
TEX_distract_public:0 "Distract the Public"
TEX_distract_public_desc:0 "The public is a fickle thing, and if we want their support, we have to give them distractions. Like the Roman saying of 'bread and circuses', we will ensure our people are focused on entertainment and other things so that we have free reign to implement our plans. Further, through rousing speeches, Earl Long himself will have the people in his hands, and this will surely enhance his popularity."
TEX_secure_the_long_machine:0 "Secure the Long Machine"
TEX_secure_the_long_machine_desc:0 "Huey Long's machine was never opened to Earl Long before the Civil War, and it is something that Earl bitterly remembers. Now that he is in power though, we must seize the machine for ourselves, to help ensure we maintain power for as long as we need to and to ensure nobody else gets their hands on it. Though he had to wait his turn, Earl Long can finally take his rightful place at the head of the Long family and its powerful political machine."
TEX_plenty_of_snap_in_my_garters:0 "Plenty of Snap in my Garters"
TEX_plenty_of_snap_in_my_garters_desc:0 "Given his smaller reputation and tendency to spend time with the downtrodden rather than Huey's old practice of dividing his time among all economic classes, some have said Earl is unworthy to succeed Huey Long. Some even say that Earl lacks the vision or ambition that his brother had. For those in doubt, though, Earl Long only has one thing to say: "I've got plenty of snap left in my garters!"."
TEX_charm_the_people:0 "Charm the People"
TEX_charm_the_people_desc:0 "An Earl Long speech is not an event, it is an experience. Crowds of tens of thousands come to see his colorful oratory and his humorous anecdotes, and though his speeches are not very policy-focused, the people love them anyways. Through barnstorming the country and doing his beloved work of connecting with common people, Earl will win them over to his cause."
TEX_three_ps:0 "The Three Ps"
TEX_three_ps_desc:0 "Politicking, Plain People, and Pea Patch Farm; these are the things most important to Earl Long. A mastermind political actor as well as a lover of farmers and other average workers, Earl Long would much rather spend his time with voters and supporters on his farm than engage with perfumed politicians in an office. Though he has ambitious plans to reform the nation even now, sometimes it is best to enjoy the simpler things."
TEX_a_new_direction:0 "A New Direction"
TEX_a_new_direction_desc:0 "Rather than closely following his brother's plans, Earl Long has decided to move forward with his own plan of reforms. Though it is similar in many ways to Huey's vision, Earl notes that his plan takes a firm stance on race, and does more to engage with the working people of America. After all, what better way is there to win new voters?"
TEX_black_enfranchisement:0 "Black Enfranchisement"
TEX_black_enfranchisement_desc:0 "The issue of the Black vote has been a taboo in the South for decades, but now that the Civil War is over and Earl Long is in control, it must be readdressed. We will ensure that people of all races, especially Blacks, will be able to vote if they choose to do so, and hopefully, they will choose to vote for us in gratitude."
TEX_feed_the_hungry:0 "Feed the Hungry"
TEX_feed_the_hungry_desc:0 "Though blatant starvation is rare in America, there is still a large part of the population that is underfed, particularly children. By ensuring that workers have the money they need to feed their families and that children have access to free lunches at school, we can ensure our people focus on other matters besides their growling stomachs."
TEX_equal_teachers_pay:0 "Equal Teachers Pay"
TEX_equal_teachers_pay_desc:0 "America's teachers have received dismal treatment as of late, and they have never been paid as much as they are worth. Never one to turn away a possible vote, Earl Long has decided that it is necessary to increase teacher's salaries, and ensure that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender. Experienced teachers will be paid more, but with this discrimination largely out of the way, our families will do better as a whole."
TEX_modern_hospitals:0 "Modern Hospitals"
TEX_modern_hospitals_desc:0 "Our hospitals are in need of modern equipment and technology, and Earl Long is happy to provide whatever they need. Modernizing urban hospitals, building new ones in rural areas, and overall ensuring that the sick always have somewhere they can be taken care of, Earl hopes that we can take care of all our veterans and anyone else harmed by the Civil War. We will take care of our people, and they will take care of us."
TEX_rock_em_sock_em:0 "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em"
TEX_rock_em_sock_em_desc:0 "Uncle Earl is seen by many to be a tireless man, but when questioned on his superhuman stamina, he merely stated that he engages in "Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em" politics, and stated that if his rivals didn't like it, they should go somewhere else. His criss-crossing of the country has made him a star in the eyes of millions, and his engaging and often humorous speeches are more popular than ever."
TEX_american_radicalism:0 "American Radicalism"
TEX_american_radicalism_desc:0 "The oddball Alfred Bingham and his movement for American Radicalism have taken power in the country. Though they do not follow Huey Long's agenda closely, they purport to be his intellectual successors, and insist that their policies will fulfill his goals. The middle-class radical hopes to win over the American people, but first he must decide what policies are most important to him."
TEX_the_middle_class_mind:0 "The Middle Class Mind"
TEX_the_middle_class_mind_desc:0 "To create a revolution in a bourgeois nation, we must engage with the middle class mind. The middle class is ready for a classless society, and Bingham believes the average American does more to act like someone in a commune than a rugged individualist. By tailoring our rhetoric to this class, making sure we do not offend their wealthier sensibilities, we can create something truly revolutionary in the nation."
TEX_tactical_realism:0 "Tactical Realism"
TEX_tactical_realism_desc:0 "To bring the American people to our side, we must make small changes to the economy. This way, few will be upset at what are largely seen as modest reforms, though they will be a complete overhaul of the economy over time. One step at a time, we will chip away at the old system, as Huey Long did, and create a new, better economy."
TEX_outflank_capitalism:0 "Outflank Capitalism"
TEX_outflank_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism is still popular with a majority of Americans, and to undermine it, we should demonstrate its dysfunction as a system. To do this, we will repurpose old factories and take over a vertical cross-section of the economy, operating it on the production-for-use basis rather than the old profit system. This is merely a test, but we believe the people will react well to it."
TEX_lure_them_in:0 "Lure Them In"
TEX_lure_them_in_desc:0 "We are not deaf to the concerns of the American people. Though they are concerned about economics, they yearn for patriotic appeals too, and if we hope to keep their support, we must take advantage of this. By painting our movement as uniquely American in nature and rousing up feelings of nationalism, we can speed up our reforms and prevent other rival groups from using that rhetoric for their own purposes."
TEX_socialist_efficiency:0 "Socialist Efficiency"
TEX_socialist_efficiency_desc:0 "Now that we have begun the reformation of the economy, it is time to show the American people that the socialist system we envision is more efficient. We will slowly but surely transition our economy to a socialist model, nationalizing major industries and outflanking the old industrialist class."
TEX_society_of_plenty:0 "Society of Plenty"
TEX_society_of_plenty_desc:0 "America is a nation of vast resources, and yet until recently, they were concentrated in the hands of a few. Now, there will be a more equal distribution, and in a new society of plenty, all will prosper. No longer will our resources be thrown away for profit motives; we will use them in the interests of the everyday American, and we shall be the powerhouse we were always meant to be."
TEX_common_sense:0 "Common Sense"
TEX_common_sense_desc:0 "Drawing on the rhetoric of Thomas Paine and other American thinkers, Alfred Bingham created the monthly journal of the same name. Now that he is in power, Common Sense has become the most popular journal in the country, and Bingham has decided to use it to help promote his ideas to those who have never considered them before. With crucial media support, we can continue advancing towards a new nation."
TEX_insurgent_americans:0 "Insurgent Americans"
TEX_insurgent_americans_desc:0 "In a recent book by Alfred Bingham, in which he dubbed the American people as 'insurgent Americans', it was said that the American people cry out for change. It is true, and with Bingham as their leader, the American people will finally get a more equitable system, a system in which fairness rules the day and greed has been driven from our shores. America has risen up!"
TEX_rehabilitate_leftist_radicals:0 "Rehabilitate Leftist Radicals"
TEX_rehabilitate_leftist_radicals_desc:0 "Bingham understands that our movement pales in comparison to the likes of Huey Long's following, and so, we should make some attempt to rehabilitate leftist radicals from other Civil War factions. From Upton Sinclair to Norman Thomas, we will do our best to help these fellow radicals understand that we are not their enemies, and in some cases, we will reunite with long-lost allies to build a larger socialist movement than ever."
TEX_peace_in_the_west:0 "Peace in the West"
TEX_peace_in_the_west_desc:0 "On the West Coast, Upton Sinclair's EPIC plan is still a commonly known proposal in the minds of many. It has relevance for us too, for the EPIC plan inspired much of Bingham's own policies, particularly in attacking capitalism by outflanking it, rather than fighting it directly. With the hopes that we can charm Sinclair to our side, we will be able to win another portion of America's radicals to our side."
TEX_assimilate_the_bellamyists:0 "Assimilate the Bellamyists"
TEX_assimilate_the_bellamyists_desc:0 "The Bellamyists in the CSA were our allies; though they sided with a different faction, this was done to attempt to influence as many sides as possible. Now that the country is united once more, we should reunite with the likes of John Dewey, who is an old friend of Bingham's. It is likely that they could be persuaded to join us, and with them on our side, we will be all the more stronger."
TEX_production_for_use:0 "Production for Use"
TEX_production_for_use_desc:0 "For centuries, America has operated on a production for profit system. Resources have been wasted, the people have suffered, and all of it for what, a Civil War? Bingham has a new vision, a vision of a society in which products are made on the basis of use, not profit, and in doing so, we will create a more just and equitable society. We will create a simultaneously more efficient and humane economy that takes care of all Americans, and we will be the envy of the world."
TEX_national_insurance_system:0 "National Insurance System"
TEX_national_insurance_system_desc:0 "In continuing Huey Long's reforms and pushing for his own, Bingham has decided that a national insurance system is needed. For example, this will guarantee that any American can go to a hospital if they are sick and injured, and show the world that a country that takes care of its people will be a prosperous one. The mafia-like insurance companies will never terrorize Americans again!"
TEX_abolish_speculation:0 "Abolish Speculation"
TEX_abolish_speculation_desc:0 "The damaging practice of speculation, once done in banks and financial institutions all over America, must end. We cannot allow banks to play with people's money; instead, they should focus on their other responsibilities, as they always should have."
TEX_solidify_public_ownership:0 "Solidify Public Ownership"
TEX_solidify_public_ownership_desc:0 "The national ownership of public utilities such as water, electricity, railroads, and more, must be assured. By finishing what Huey started in giving the ownership of these tools to the people, we will create a nation in which profit is not the driving force. Through this, we will continue on the road to a truly production-for-use society."
TEX_technology_and_technocracy:0 "Technology and Technocracy"
TEX_technology_and_technocracy_desc:0 "Though Bingham is not purely a technocrat, he does admit that they have certain useful ideas. The ideals of a futuristic nation in which experts can run the government are appealing, and we should seek to promote the type of world envisioned by thinkers such as Edward Bellamy, among others."
TEX_true_democracy:0 "True Democracy"
TEX_true_democracy_desc:0 "Now that we have created a nation that is not only politically democratic, but democratic in the workplace and the economy overall, we can finally say with pride that we live in a democratic nation. It is not the old false democracy of capitalism, but instead, a comprehensive democratic system, in which all people can take part."
TEX_visionary_from_prospect_hill:0 "The Visionary from Prospect Hill"
TEX_visionary_from_prospect_hill_desc:0 "From his beginnings in Prospect Hill, Alfred Bingham has had a long and harrowing journey. Influenced by mostly American thought, as well as some foreign thought, he has created an America that he is proud of, an America in which a middle class revolution has manifested. Finally, we can move forward as a classless society and enjoy prosperity for years to come."

### Reconstruction ###
TEX_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "A long struggle to push through the Federalist, Syndicalist, and ODP forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained. The hand that unifies the country can either promote a deficit spending regime, or an austere policy that limits direct intervention in the market."
TEX_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery Administration"
TEX_national_recovery_desc:0 "The NRA emphasizes the use of public domain and work-living units instead of 'cut throat competition' of regular contract work. Workers in the NRA will receive the benefit of a minimum wages and price-controlled work environments in constant to the old Company Store model."
TEX_public_works:0 "Public Works Administration"
TEX_public_works_desc:0 "The ability to generate electricity, transport water, and ensure safe and efficient travel was lost during the civil war. However, the Public Works Administration will fix all that. It is a fund that will ensure contractors pay their employees fairly, so that their are better incentivized to help rebuild."
TEX_research_projects:0 "National Education Administration"
TEX_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members have dispersed. With most teachers being apolitical and the union never being able to exert much partisan power over them, it is a strong candidate for rehabilitation by the new American government."
TEX_civil_works_adminstration:0 "National Public Works"
TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc:0 "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labor supply to the fighting and poverty of recent years. The leader has pushed an executive order authorizing the creation of an agency to employ manual laborers to fill out the spaces in employment for NRA projects."
TEX_the_ccc:0 "National Valley Authority"
TEX_the_ccc_desc:0 "The damage done to America by the civil war has been considerable, and even approaching the idea of reconstruction seems like an insurmountable problem. An idea has been floating around the capital of establishing a public body to oversee not only the reconstruction effort but looking into how to rebuild a better America once that project is complete."
TEX_rural_electrification:0 "Rural Electrification"
TEX_rural_electrification_desc:0 "The electricity network throughout the country has regressed to that of the 1910s. This is un-American and we need to ensure that our constituents can be properly informed about our nation's glory. Further, electrification will give our rural areas access to much "
TEX_wealth_cap:0 "Wealth Cap" 
TEX_the_aaa:0 "Farm Relief"
TEX_the_aaa_desc:0 "Farms are the basis of the American economy, but they have seen devastation wrought from the Civil War. Only through a combination of direct farm aid via lump cash payouts to compensate for damaged equipment, purchasing farm goods, and contracting industrial areas to build capital instruments for farming can we hope to begin recovery."
TEX_farm_security_administration:0 "Farm Securities Act"
TEX_farm_security_administration_desc:0 "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core of the South and the Great Plains. We must extend a credit program with very low interest rates to farmers who apply to resettle land, especially land in the old Steel Belt."
TEX_begin_reconstruction:0 "Rebuild Urban Housing"
TEX_begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "The civil war has blasted our country to pieces. Large parts of the rural country are naught but mud and ashes, while countless cities have been reduced to smoldering rubble. We shall set to work developing new housing and infrastructure as soon as possible."
TEX_harsh_reconstruction:0 "Seize Treacherous Wealth"
TEX_harsh_reconstruction_desc:0 "Congress has sided with us in condemning these companies that betrayed the American people. Lists of majority shareholders in traitorous companies have been seized, and the executive officers of companies that have exploited workers behind the facade of government are now on trial."
TEX_reconciliation:0 "Conditional Forgiveness"
TEX_reconciliation_desc:0 "Congress finally won out against the executive branch, and has decided not to bring charges against seditious companies. Executive officers were pressured to resign in order for their company to be re-listed however, but ultimately the shareholders are deemed innocent of wrongdoing."
TEX_employment_expansion:0 "Employment Expansion"
TEX_employment_expansion_desc:0 "We will continue to help our workforce get back on its feet. With new housing and infrastructure being built, unemployment has significantly gone down, and our economy has almost recovered from the Civil War."
TEX_reconstruction_is_over:0 "Reconstruction is Over"
TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy. The wiser constituents of these windbags have largely voted them out by now, as our GDP rises and the American standard of living rises and even exceeds pre-war levels."
TEX_infrastructure_effort:0 "Infrastructure Efforts"
TEX_infrastructure_effort_desc:0 "Technology is rapidly changing our world. The automobile is becoming the main mode of transportation for many people, and we must adjust accordingly. Let us build up our roads and bridges to handle this new demand, and create a national highway system."
TEX_recognize_philantrophers:0 "Recognize Philanthropists"
TEX_recognize_philantrophers_desc:0 "While many members of the wealthy opposed the AUS' efforts to redistribute goods, even within a capitalist economy, there are some who remained neutral in this debate. We should speak to them about donating to charity and award them medals for doing so, so they may set an example for others with the means to donate."
TEX_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic:0 "The Grand Army of the Republic"
TEX_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_desc:0 "An organization from the first American Civil War intended to represent veterans, the organization is on its last legs due to few veterans still surviving. However, we can revive the organization by having recent ACW vets join, giving them a society with internal aid, organization and a means of easily communicating their interests while providing us with new allies."
TEX_dependent_and_disability_act:0 "Dependent and Disability Act"
TEX_dependent_and_disability_act_desc:0 "Based on an older Civil War Act, the GAR is pushing for us to revive the Dependent and Disability Act which would provide Federal pension aid for disabled veterans and widows of dead veterans.

TEX_department_of_public_safety_desc:0 "The Department of Public Safety will not only provide jobs to potential government workers but help regulate industry and consumer products to be safer, rewarding those who best comply with tax breaks. We will do our best to cut down on work accidents."
TEX_work_programs:0 "Veteran Work Programs"
TEX_work_programs_desc:0 "Veterans are still out of work, partly due to their lack of opportunity. Our work programs will retrain veterans so that they may better enter the job market, and subsidize those markets. Veterans should live a life of dignity, not poverty."
TEX_state_grants:0 "State Grants"
TEX_state_grants_desc:0 "Sometimes, local officials know the best place to spend their resources. State grants will entrust governors and state governments loyal to our Republic with how they decide to rebuild the industries that best suit them, and who needs the most support."

TEX_focus_on_concentration:0 "Focus on Fire Concentration"
TEX_focus_on_concentration_desc:0 "Force Concentration has been an invaluable tactic for every commander since the times of the Roman Legions.

TEX_focus_on_command:0 "Focus on Command"
TEX_focus_on_command_desc:0 "Our enemies in the civil war can be described simply as disorganized and demoralized militias with occasional remnants of the former Army presenting any real resistance.

TEX_new_arms_factories:0 "New Arms Factories"
TEX_new_arms_factories_desc:0 "The main trouble with creating a military industry is that facilities under our control were already reduced from the Great Depression to reduce redundancies. We have had to expand facilities and repurpose old buildings in order to manufacture parts needed for heavy weapons in our territory."

AUS_new_army_goes_rolling_along_desc:0 "Our New Army has readopted the old motto used by our fore-fathers who took up arms to defend our great nation. Like them before our team, now it is time for us to fight for America in an ever changing world, be it at home or abroad."
TEX_army_bonus_bill:0 "Army Bonus Bill"
TEX_army_bonus_bill_desc:0 "Combat hardens boys into men and men into solid steel - unshakeable pillars of Americanism. Only a fool would leave veterans such as these by the wayside.

TEX_Lightning_Joe:0 "Lightning Joe"
TEX_Lightning_Joe_desc:0 "Given how outdated the Army organization has become, General Collins has approached us with a reform plan. He has noted that victory will require the industry on the Plains to adapt to the needs of the artillery branch, which shall lead the way to defeat the traitors in the East and West. While there are skeptics among the government, his proposition should nevertheless be considered."
TEX_Terrible_Terry:0 "Terrible Terry"
TEX_Terrible_Terry_desc:0 "The uncouth General Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. has put forward a clear-thinking plan based on superior tactics, combat preparation, and pressing the enemy wherever they are weak.

TEX_rapid_construction:0 "Rapid Construction"
TEX_rapid_construction_desc:0 "If the Union State is going to put out motorized vehicles at the rate it needs to, we must build our military industry in Texas as quickly as possible. We must do so even if it means using manpower for the task of building fortifications and military factories in the short term. It will have a much greater payoff of industrialization."
TEX_towards_motorization:0 "Towards Motorization"
TEX_towards_motorization_desc:0 "Despite the obvious superiorities of motorized vehicles over cavalry, older officers have been reluctant to make the switch, stubbornly arguing for cavalry superiority.

TEX_new_tank_designs:0 "New Tank Designs"
TEX_new_tank_designs_desc:0 "With military sciences focused on motorization, we must improve our tanks.

TEX_expand_ACTS:0 "Expand the Air Corps Tactical School"
TEX_expand_ACTS_desc:0 "We are lucky enough that the American Army in the past relegated air officer training to the deep South, as we now possess access to the installations and officers from the Air Corps Tactical School in Maxwell Field, Alabama.

TEX_fighters:0 "Fighter Development"
TEX_fighters_desc:0 "American fighter projects were halted during the 1920s due to a lack of funding from the government, leading to a disadvantage in fighter development.

TEX_naval_bombers_desc:0 "With the shortcomings of our navy for protecting our shores, the air force has the duty to also protect the shores of our nation for whatever cost against any enemy who dare set foot in our homeland. As such, we will seek to complement the Navy's patrols with naval bombers scouting and intercepting any vessels whenever our fleet is too spread out or too far away to do so."
TEX_Weyland_plan:0 "Parsons Plan"

TEX_combined_arms_offensive_desc:0 "While our air officers stand at the ready, an issue has arisen once more that impedes the progress of our force: Army officers don't exactly know how to exploit our air power to its fullest potential.

TEX_long_range_interceptors_desc:0 "While fighters can secure the skies above the battlefields, the battle at the enemy's doorstep is usually too far away for them to step in to protect our bomber wings from the enemy fighters. To counter this, we have managed to create and improve heavier designs with longer to have bigger agility to stand a chance in air-to-air combat, and further investment in this area may yield great benefits."

TEX_back_in_business_desc:0 "Now that our position as a world power has been restored to us, it is time to figure out where we fit into the scheme of things. Most of our politicians, and people, are urging us towards isolationism. This would be simple, as it would mostly continue the foreign policy America had before the war. However, every isolationist is different, and some say it would be wise to seek allies in this changing world."
TEX_americanist_doctrine:0 "Americanist Doctrine"
TEX_americanist_doctrine_desc:0 "It would not serve us to isolate ourselves, as we have been in the past. At the same time, we will not play second fiddle to some other power.

TEX_popular_monroeism:0 "Review Monroeism"
TEX_popular_monroeism_desc:0 "During the Second Civil War, we largely abandoned our Monroe Doctrine obligations. Facing new threats, the countries of Latin America have turned inward, or to one another, for protection. We should pursue a new Monroe Doctrine, motivated not by greed, but by brotherhood. We are all Americans in a sense, and we will never suffer colonizers again!"
TEX_populist_alliance:0 "Populist Alliance"
TEX_populist_alliance_desc:0 "The old model of exploitation has been thrown out. Instead, we should win nations over with diplomacy, economic arrangements, and military protection.

TEX_internationale_non_agression_pact:0 "Internationale Peace Agreement"
TEX_internationale_non_agression_pact_desc:0 "Though we may not agree with the Internationale on everything, we share many goals.

TEX_ideological_neutrality:0 "Ideological Neutrality"
TEX_ideological_neutrality_desc:0 "The ideologically-driven conflicts that are now commonplace in our world are worthless in our view.

TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism:0 "Oppose American Syndicalism"
TEX_oppose_american_syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalism is too extreme for our tastes. We should make sure that it does not become commonplace in the New World. We should target syndicalist nations in our hemisphere and suggest they either change course or, if they resist, face our intervention."

TEX_align_nationalists_desc:0 "We should align ourselves with those who share our belief in nationalism. We do not have to agree on which country is better, but we should agree on preventing outside invasion or control of any sort from coming into the Western Hemisphere.

TEX_denounce_oligarchs:0 "Denounce the War Racket"
TEX_denounce_oligarchs_desc:0 "Oil tycoons and automobile companies have begged us to start new wars abroad. Of course, this would be for their benefit, but not ours. We will not pay our corporations in the blood of our young people. War is a racket!"
TEX_investigate_war_lobbyists:0 "Investigate the War Lobby"
TEX_investigate_war_lobbyists_desc:0 "We are swarmed by lobbyists on a daily basis. Instead of letting these people get away with a slap on the wrist, why don't we investigate them? After all, these are the same people who sided with MacArthur in the war, and who knows who they might support in the future? They cannot be trusted. Put these traitors away."
TEX_break_war_mongerers:0 "Stop American War Mongers"
TEX_break_war_mongerers_desc:0 "We've had enough of Canada intervening in our affairs. We have kicked the British out of our lands before, but if we are to commit to a new Monroe Doctrine, we have to go farther than that. What shall our next course of action towards them be?"

TEX_contain_hostile_leftism_desc:0 "When leftism goes too far, we must not be afraid to stop it in its tracks. Aggressive left-wing regimes now drown out the more peaceful ones and have significantly drive up world tension. We should act to stop them before it is too late."
TEX_end_carles:0 "Mend the Argentinian Chaos"
TEX_end_carles_desc:0 "Argentina has always been among the most important nations in Latin America, serving as a natural counterbalance to Brazil. Regrettably, their status has long fallen down from the heights achieved during the years of the united La Plata. With a series of never ending revolts, wars and dictatorial strongmen during the 19th and 20th century the Argentinian people have suffered for far too long. It's time to re-assert the role of America as the guarantor of peace in that chaotic landscape."
TEX_break_militarists:0 "Break Militarist Aggressors"
TEX_break_militarists_desc:0 "We will attack ultra-nationalist regimes in our backyard, regimes that have caused endless violence and suffering for the people of the New World.

TEX_mutual_trade:0 "Mutual Trade"
TEX_mutual_trade_desc:0 "We have no wishes to dominate the nations of Latin America. We want a true brotherhood with these countries.

TEX_research_agreement:0 "Research Initiative"

J. Pendergast, along with his cronies like Joe Shannon, Cas Welch, and Henry Francis McElroy, will stop at nothing to enrich himself, his large Irish family, and his loyal and well-bribed league of sycophants, all while he further tightens Missouri and the rest of the Union in the palm of his fat, rich hands."

Through every legal channel and covert-enough back channel possible, we shall remove the Longists from all places of power possible and replace them with our own lackeys and loyalists, swaying all those we can to join our Democratic Party with bribery and blackmail or with our more Liberal policies, for the good of all Americans of course, especially Pendergast."

By pulling on these contacts and calling in old favors, Pendergast will build a web of loyalists, informants, and allies all across the burning Union, aiding us in our struggle to reintegrate the lost lands of America."

TEX_swaying_philantropists:0 "A Common Touch"
TEX_swaying_philantropists_desc:0 "Pendergast has always tried to portray a ‘common touch’ when it comes to politics. A media darling, or media whore depending on who you ask, he has frequently made attention-seeking displays in order to win over the masses and to seem more human in the eye of the public. Paying medical bills of sick citizens, providing temporary jobs to the homeless, and hosting famous holiday dinners for the poor masses of Kansas City, Pendergast has done it all, and he will continue to do so at a national level in order to pull the wool over the peoples’ eyes as he bends the Union State to his own whims. In order to aid him in this national push, Pendergast has recruited the help of famous Kansas City philanthropist William Volker, whose Board of Public Welfare shall be the mouthpiece and mediator of these new populist reforms.

In line with his dreams of total economic domination and his continue life living in the lap of luxury like some monarch, Pendergast will spread his stamp to every profitable firm and business in the Union from the shipping and construction industries to resource extraction and simple mercantile operations, slowly but surely buying up parts of different ventures or creating his own when he has no other alternative, all in an attempt to directly profit off of every sale and purchase in America, for the good of himself, the political machine, and for all Americans."

We will win over the Black vote, the Mexican vote, and any other vote we can nab with our own brand of authoritarian and heavily corrupt faux-Liberalism using new allies like Truman and Dr. William J. Thompkins to pave this new way forward. The new Democratic Party shall be liberal-leaning, tolerant, heavily urban, and ethnically diverse - the political home for African Americans and most new immigrant groups by huge margins. With our powerbase of Midwest Irish Catholics joining forces with Blacks, immigrants, workers, and just enough ‘Southern’ Whites all joining forces behind a vision of a government that helped ordinary people live their lives rather than judging what they did with them, we will build a new and better Party. Ruthlessly practical and non-ideological, it has been termed ‘socialism Kansas City-style’ by our rivals, but we know the truth as we offer relative justice, cheap drinks, and public works for all, regardless of class, creed, or color, so long as they vote the straight Democratic ticket as we rebrand what it means to be a Democrat."

With deep ties to illegal gambling rings, booze bootleggers, organized crime and more, Pendergast has made many dangerous enemies over his career, but he is kept safe by even more dangerous allies.

In the spirit of good spirits, Pendergast has moved to not only publicly decry any idea of temperance, but has conversely gone on to pass Prohibition at the national level. Under this oppressive system, Pendergast and his goons will control the entire ‘illegal’ liquor and booze industry in America, ensuring that all profits from alcohol sales, creation, and consumption flows directly into the pockets of Pendergast and the political machine. Furthering this plan, Pendergast has also gone on to fund the creation and renovation of distilleries and breweries across the nation, such as his own T.J. Pendergast Wholesale Liquor Co., Atlas Beverage Co., and the City Beverage Company, while incentivizing small business owners to open up new bars or other seedy dens of gambling, drinking, and sin.

During that time, it was rumored that Pendergast had his political opponents thrown in the creek as it was paved over with concrete sealing them away and forcing them to become part of the foundation of his new successes. Echoing these civic projects, we shall start a new wave of constructions across the nation, building new urban centers and civil infrastructure to aid the workings and functions of the state, and if a few of our political enemies were to fall in the concrete mix yet again, so be it."

A similar organization from Dixie, E.H. Crump’s Social Machine, has also expressed their interest in working with our organization for the good of all America and for the betterment of the Bosses. With our shared ideas of corrupting democracy, working with criminal groups, subjugating free democracy, espousing flashy and fake Christian Conservative Populism, our inclusion of minorities in order to swipe their votes, and our support of Irish dominance all being aligned, these Tammany Tigers and Crumpites would make the perfect allies, and will help us greatly as we work to integrate and subjugate the Northeast and Dixie."

Repeating his strategy used in Kansas City and wider Missouri while using famous and widely beloved figures of the Black Struggle like Dr. William J.

unionstate.2101.t:0 "Texas Democrats Attempt a Resurgence"
unionstate.2101.d:0 "After a long struggle between Ma Ferguson and W. Lee O'Daniel in Texas, it seems that O'Daniel has emerged as the standardbearer of Texas Democrats. However, he is not content with this outcome, and he has begun to campaign on the national stage. O'Daniel hopes to bring his populist message and conservative economic policies to all Americans, and though he is officially a Democrat, he has deviated from traditional Democratic messaging and campaigning in his embrace of some of Huey Long's rhetoric. His campaign, drawing from his radio audience and traditional Democrat voters overall, has quickly amassed support nationwide, and O'Daniel threatens to overshadow Long as the man Americans look up to for guidance. His charisma should not be underestimated, and perhaps we should take Texas more seriously to try and shut him up."
unionstate.2101.a:0 "Take him down!"
unionstate.2101.b:0 "Why should we take a flour salesman seriously?"

unionstate.22.t:0 "Formation of the Christian Party"
unionstate.22.d:0 "With the growth of the Silver Legion under William Dudley Pelley and the announcement of the election, the Christian Party has announced it will stand at the next elections. Eating into the support of the right-wing of the AFP and the now rump Democratic Party, the Christian Party is running on a protestant Christian Democratic platform with progressive economic policies including wealth dividends and full employment. Perhaps we should pander to our right-wing so as to stop their support?"
unionstate.22.a:0 "That would do more harm than good"
unionstate.22.b:0 "Yes, of course"

unionstate.23.t:0 "Long Associate Disappears!"
unionstate.23.d:0 "A shocking scandal in Louisiana took place earlier this week when Sam Irby, the uncle to Long's secretary and rumored mistress, disappeared from his hotel room in the Gardner Hotel after it is said members of the Louisiana Bureau of Criminal Identification entered the building! This is a blow to the opposition Democrats whom are rumored to have been interviewing Irby about Long's supposed affair with Irby's niece. Already accusations of kidnapping have taken place but neither Long nor his secretary have commented on it."

unionstate.26.t:0 "The Texas Devils"
unionstate.26.d:0 "The Texas Rangers are under our jurisdiction and their leader Col. Lee Simmons are loyal to us. They are currently struggling to contain the many domestic terrorist threats in our nation however. He has requested that we green light a plan to bring back famed Ranger Frank Hamer to once again tackle the Klan in our territory and provide funding to do so. This would undoubtedly weaken the Klan but perhaps their efforts would be more useful elsewhere?"
unionstate.26.a:0 "Greenlight it"
unionstate.26.b:0 "Target generic robbers instead"
unionstate.26.c:0 "Have them help train the troops instead"

unionstate.27.t:0 "Bonnie and Clyde Gang"
unionstate.27.d:0 "While crime in rampant throughout the territory as criminals look to make a easy buck from the unstable nature of America one criminal group in particular has gained infamy, namely the Barrow gang. This is largely due to the sensationalist takes on Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a couple apparently leading the gang and whom are often called Bonnie and Clyde for short. The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing. Famously Clyde Barrow himself carries a Browning Automatic Rifle. Unfortunately the gang is gaining an undeserved folksy reputation and undermining the legitimacy of the state, how should we respond?"
unionstate.27.a:0 "Send the Texas Rangers"
unionstate.27.b:0 "Send the National Guard"
unionstate.27.c:0 "We don't have the resources for this"

unionstate.28.t:0 "Pendergast Machine"
unionstate.28.d:0 "Tom Pendergast is the political boss of Kansas City and Jackson County with a reputation for running his cities as his personal fiefdom. Nonetheless, he is not very welcoming towards the Constitutional American Republic whom hope to displace him and his system with the Old Democrats and other more hardcore white supremacists and prohibitionists whom view Pendergast as a seller of vice which in all honesty he is. Certainly this does not make him the greater evil to us nor are we to him, leading to him asking for protection. His machine would undermine the AFP power and not be wholly popular but would provide the AUS as a whole with greater resources, men who could be recruited in his territory and assistance from Pendergast's organized crime allies who could make our lives easier and CAR's more difficult. On the other hand we could just run AFP candidates in his territory and scare off him and his ally mobster Charles Carrollo by threatening to charge them should they not leave. What should we do?"
unionstate.28.a:0 "Make the alliance"
unionstate.28.b:0 "Kansas City ain't big enough for the two of us"

unionstate.29.t:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union"
unionstate.29.d:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union is a left-wing bureau for tenant farmers legally operating within our territory and supporting the American Union State over the rightist Constitutional American Republic, whom are repressing the STFU in their territory. This makes them potentially useful allies as they can help disrupt activities within the CAR if provided funding and perhaps even giving its leader Harry Leland Mitchell a seat on our cabinet. However, some in the party are reluctant to do so due to it being widely known the STFU has heavy sympathies with some of the Combined Syndicates of America despite not being based out of their territory. Providing support will surely help us shore up support but nonetheless would increase socialist sympathies and anger social conservatives who dislike the STFU's progressive stance on race issues."
unionstate.29.a:0 "Provide some support"
unionstate.29.b:0 "Put them on Our Cabinet"
unionstate.29.c:0 "I don't think so"

unionstate.30.t:0 "Progressive Merger Proposed"
unionstate.30.d:0 "Huey's main ally in Congress and now in the AUS has long been the Midwest Progressive and Farmer-Labor organizations despite an occasionally tense relationship due to disagreements with Long's style of populism and alleged demagoguery. However a recent proposal would strengthen this alliance. It comes from Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a radical activist and lead editor of the periodical Common Sense, is supportive of progressivism, the AFP and the right-wing of the CSA and is responsible for running the American Farmer-Labor Federation. The AFLF is made up of middle-class activists organizing mainly for the working class and which has connections with the AFP, the Progressives and even Bellaymists in the CSA. Despite the Federations flexibility it's stance on economic issues revolves around economic planning when it comes to agrarian goods and recently Bingham and other members of the Federation have begun to see the AFP as the best possible route to a radical but patriotic future. They have proposed forming the American Commonwealth Co-operative Movement, under which they would openly join the AFP in a political alliance. While this would shore up our support among left-leaning activists and undermine the National Progressive Party has potential competition it could tie us to more left-wing economic policies than some of our party members are comfortable with."
unionstate.30.a:0 "Of Course Not"
unionstate.30.b:0 "Absolutely, a fantastic opportunity"

unionstate.3001.t:0 "Second Great Migration"
unionstate.3001.d:0 "Despite the attempts of the Constitutional American Republic to force black Americans to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of Black Americans are fleeing to the North and West. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of Texas are seeing an inflow of Black migrants but the machines representing many whites, particularly the questionably loyal local Democratic Parties as well as part of the AFP, are demanding we take away their right to vote so as to not threaten their political supremacy. White populists such as Gerald L.K. Smith suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the AFP and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."
unionstate.3001.a:0 "Let them in"
unionstate.3001.b:0 "Let them in, but they can't vote"
unionstate.3001.c:0 "Announce we won't be taking in anymore"

unionstate.3002.t:0 "The Old Regulars"
unionstate.3002.d:0 "The Regular Democratic Organization is Louisiana's political machine for conservative Democrats and are Long's traditional opponents in his home state. Despite this the two have made alliances in the past and with the "Old Regulars" having questionable loyalty to the AUS over CAR or the USA now might be the time to make another such alliance, agreeing not to run AFP candidates in Southern Louisiana in return for them not openly opposing us. Of course, some Old Regulars have already crossed over to the Old Democrats and refuse to support Long, begging the question of whether we should simply "investigate" the organization for corruption and have it basically shut down which would also increase the AFP's hold on the state. Of course, this would push the old money elite even more against Long as well as the most ardent white supremacists."
unionstate.3002.a:0 "Cede part of Louisiana"
unionstate.3002.b:0 "Investigate them"

unionstate.3003.t:0 "Black Troop Debate!"
unionstate.3003.d:0 "The question of black combat troops has long been a contentious one in the United States, with race traditionalists insisting that blacks lack the intellectual faculties to be combat troops whereas others insist this is an absurd position and simply robs us of much needed soldiers. Currently Gerald L.K. Smith leads the charge on behalf of race traditionalists, insisting that blacks can not be expected to be soldiers and gain the same benefits as white soldiers. Charles Coughlin and much the Silver Legion are in accordance with this, although Pelley himself is ambivalent about letting Northern Blacks join as combat troops. He is a hardliner when it comes to Southern Blacks, insisting they lack the 'intelligence and civility' to be troops. On the other side, Jacob Devers, the AFP machine in Louisiana and the Radicals in the AUS such as the Non-Partisan League, have pushed for black combat troops, admonishing the traditionalists for wanting to choose defeat just to spite blacks. They insist we should have Devers lead a recruitment campaign."
unionstate.3003.a:0 "We need black troops"
unionstate.3003.b:0 "We can not allow it"

unionstate.3004.t:0 "Minneapolis Syndicalists Strike!"
unionstate.3004.d:0 "While the state of Minnesota is in the control of the farmer-labor party, there remains a strong IWW element within Minneapolis whom have grown increasingly unstable since former governor Floyd Olson, whom held amicable relations with them, died. Now they are clearly desiring to join the CSA, and putting down their strikes would not only antagonize the socialists but cost us some manpower. Either we will have to pay them off or send national guard to quell them. Of course, some radicals in the AFP would prefer to just give them semi-autonomy in Minneapolis, allowing them to run it along more syndicalist lines so long as they do not attack members of the middle and upper class living there, and instead we will pay off business owners. They claim this will quell their anger altogether."
unionstate.3004.a:0 "Pay them off"
unionstate.3004.b:0 "Break them"
unionstate.3004.c:0 "Give them some autonomy"

unionstate.3005.t:0 "Silver Legion Grows"
unionstate.3005.d:0 "For conservatives who are disappointed in the Democratic Party for their lack of populist credentials compared to other factions but who are also turned off by the AFP's and NPP's progressivism, the Silver Legion's mix of conservatism and wealth redistribution has become an increasingly attractive alternative. The Democrats are becoming increasingly unpopular among the farmers and 'legacy' democrats who supported them before and are increasingly a party of tradesmen and some middle-class liberals based largely out of Texas."
unionstate.3005.a:0 "Interesting"

unionstate.3006.t:0 "Leander Perez Controversy!"
unionstate.3006.d:0 "Leander Perez is an openly corrupt judge, hardline segregationist and political boss operating out of Louisiana whom has made an alliance of pragmatism with Huey Long. Recently he has found himself in a controversy as journalists working for our political opponents have discovered his mishandling of oil leases under his watch, handing out contracts for bribes or to companies he owns. Perez is a powerful ally but his handling of the oil contracts is forcing us to take a stand on this. Of course, this could be an opportunity to get rid of Perez, especially since in the future he will likely cause problems if we stray from his vision."
unionstate.3006.a:0 "Defend him"
unionstate.3006.b:0 "Have him step down"

unionstate.3007.t:0 "Perez Demands Compensation!"
unionstate.3007.d:0 "Perez is infuriated by our attempts to make him stand down! He is demanding that we compensate him for his work if we desire to maintain our current alliance, and has threatened us if we take legal action, claiming he has more than enough evidence to take Long down with him. What should we do?"
unionstate.3007.a:0 "Pay him off"
unionstate.3007.b:0 "Get rid of him"

unionstate.3008.t:0 "Leander Perez Kidnapped!"
unionstate.3008.d:0 "Leander Perez has recently disappeared after a falling out with Huey Long. According to reports, the fight was over his position as district attorney within Louisiana and his diversion of funds Long wanted to fund the war effort. He was apparently ambushed exiting a courthouse and entering his car, after which whomever was already in the car and the driver kidnapped him. Why his bodyguards did not intervene is unknown but while Long has blamed the disappearance on socialists most don't doubt that Perez is in a swamp somewhere. With an example made, we could allow the machine he set up to go back to its usual business or we could appoint one of our own, which may be useful if we do not plan to follow the right-wing agenda of the Perez machine, with Cat Doucet being floated as an AFP representative who can take the place of Perez and reform his machine to be more in-line with our values."
unionstate.3008.a:0 "Let the Machine do what it will"
unionstate.3008.b:0 "Cat Doucet should be rewarded for his loyalty"

unionstate.34.t:0 "Fate of the Wealthiest Opponents"
unionstate.34.d:0 "The wealthiest American families whom aligned themselves with MacArthur such as Rockefeller and Morgan made a point to destroy Long so that they may end the notion of a wealth ceiling that would see them far less wealthy. Their gambled failed however, and while they have fled the nation we have taken control of their businesses left here in the states. For the large stockholders, we will have to decide if we should wholly take control of these businesses, and sell them to someone new, or allow them to retake control under new corporate leadership so long as they pay fines."
unionstate.34.a:0 "Repossess their property if found guilty"
unionstate.34.b:0 "Massive fines will do"

unionstate.35.t:0 "Smith Walks Out!"
unionstate.35.d:0 "Gerald L.K. Smith has finally had 'enough' of our shifting the party to the left and declared that he is formally joining the Christian Party, declaring us race traitors who are unwilling to stand against 'Jewish Power and syndicalist radicals'. He takes with him much of the right-wing of the AFP, leaving us more reliant on collecting former leftists to vote for us."
unionstate.35.a:0 "So be it"

unionstate.36.t:0 "Virgil Effinger Killed!"
unionstate.36.d:0 "In a cabin in Tennessee, Virgil Effinger and 12 members of the Black Legion were killed today when they were tracked down by AFP Minutemen who opened fire on the cabin in the dead of night. The Black Legion has decried this as a war crime, claiming that Effinger was not only given no chance to surrender but that Black Legion watchmen were killed before they could issue a warning, meaning the Minutemen had no intention of giving them a chance to surrender. However the operation is being celebrated across America and Ranger Manuel T. Gonzaullas, whom lead the raid, is already being awarded with medals as this will most assuredly kneecap the Black Legion."
unionstate.36.a:0 "Even more victories!"

unionstate.38.t:0 "Klan Clemency?"
unionstate.38.d:0 "With our decision to reconciliate the South old class we must decide how far to go in granting clemency to the Klan. Should we pardon lower-level members whom have take an oath of loyalty or simply force the American First Party in the South keep them in prison and try to keep Klan presence to a minimum, threatening them with retaliation if they go beyond talk."
unionstate.38.a:0 "Grant Clemency"
unionstate.38.b:0 "No, we can't let the Klan grow"

unionstate.39.t:0 "Southern Party Head"
unionstate.39.d:0 "The AFP has successfully expanded into the South using the old Democrat machines in the region for our own gain, but who should lead the organization in the deep south? There is Richard Russell Jr, who was a known moderate during the war and one of the more reluctant members of CAR, openly hoping they would shift closer to the center, however he is somewhat too socially conservative for many. Then there is James Eastland, who is more hardline on race issues but far more open to Long's economic agenda. Finally, we could pull some strings to place Earl Long in charge of the region."
unionstate.39.a:0 "Richard Russell Jr."
unionstate.39.b:0 "James Eastland"
unionstate.39.c:0 "Earl Long"

unionstate.40.t:0 "Black Share our Wealth Chapters Close"
unionstate.40.d:0 "Feeling betrayed by our decision to reconciliate with the Southern Democrats and push them aside politically speaking, many black Share Our Wealth clubs have shut down, most prominent being the one ran by Reverend J.H. Scott whom called Long a snake for betraying the same blacks who bled for him in favor of the opportunists who would have destroyed him just for political power, and said he would eventually turn on poor whites as well."
unionstate.40.a:0 "Damn!"

unionstate.41.t:0 "Dallas Klan Attacks Share Our Wealth!"
unionstate.41.d:0 "The Dallas Klan is known for having had a more ambiguous relationship with the National Klan and did not outright side with the CAR, saving itself from the state crackdowns that destroyed or damaged other Klans in the American Union State. However, with our embrace of the black vote they seem to think they have made a mistake, and have vandalized a local Share Our Wealth club, followed by sending threatening letters to black reverends now embracing Huey Long. What should we do?"
unionstate.41.a:0 "Focus on them now"

Congress is another issue however, and some AFP members claim legitimate opposition should be allowed to exist there and in the Supreme Court. The Protect America Act put forward by hardliners and backed by the Louisiana machine and Townsend would effectively give the president full legislative and judicial power, and all him to remove troublesome congressmen from power, although this would drop all pretense of national democracy even if local elections and interaction with the government through town councils and party machines continue to exist."

Privately, the Archbishop desires increased funding for Catholic diocoses, for Long to endorse friendship with Catholic nations and for it to be easier to Catholic immigrants to become naturalized immigrants.

Although [TEX.GetLeader] has solidified their position for now, it is a tenuous place to be, and an insurgent faction could very well take over. If the President presides over the funeral, it is unclear how the crowd will react, but if we were to give the speech to someone else, they could use it to their own advantage. Realizing that a choice must be made, accusations have already begun to fly. Gerald L. K. Smith has been quick to take advantage of Earl Long's uneasy relationship with his brother, noting that he was closer to the deceased man that Earl had ever been. In response, Earl Long is reported to have quipped that Gerald was a highfalutin talker who Huey wanted gone a long time ago. Charles Coughlin, noting his own movement and his ability to bring the largest crowd of anyone to honor Huey, has claimed that a true man of God should deliver the speech. To this, Smith shot back that he was a better priest than Coughlin ever was, and a better speaker at that. Earl Long, meanwhile, merely noted that his family never had much love for Romanism. Amidst the bickering, the various leftist factions have united around Bronson Cutting as their speaker of choice, noting his quiet but stalwart support for Long's proposals through his career. Few have paid close attention to this, with all opposed accusing Cutting of harboring secret anti-Longist views. A compromise candidate has also emerged, in the form of Russell B. Long, the son of the late Huey. Though the boy has shown some political acumen of his own, he is too young and inexperienced to gain power for himself, and so many have held him up as the perfect choice.

Meanwhile, the Bellamyists under Alfred Bingham are reluctant to support such a depiction, fearful of the ramifications it might have for their movement, specifically their supposed plans for democracy. Instead, they argue that any monument should take a form similar to the Lincoln Memorial, with emphasis on Long's visionary ability rather than his power. Father Charles Coughlin, meanwhile, has advocated a humble, human-size statue of Huey Long, so that he can be with the people as he was in life.

It is often said that Smith was aligned with Father Charles Coughlin for this task, and that the two figures were never loyal to begin with, given Coughlin's movement and Smith's naked ambition. Meanwhile, others, including Smith and Coughlin, responded by accusing Earl Long of involvement in the assassination. They note Earl's strained relationship with his brother, and his inability to find a place in the sun so long as Huey was alive. With his brother dead, they argue, Earl is free to gain the power he always wanted. Smith has also taken to blaming the Bellamyist faction as well, arguing that the Independence League has closer ties to the Red Belt than it ever did to Huey Long.

Now, many of the policies called for by Sinclair years ago are being seriously considered for implementation by the Bingham administration. This is not without controversy, as Sinclair joined the ranks of the now defunct Pacific government during the Civil War. There are no two ways about it, Sinclair is a traitor who joined an illegitimate government and believed the Union State strayed too far from the democratic vision of America. Nonetheless, the President believes that although he was on the wrong side of history, Sinclair is still a good man with good ideas and a genuine commitment to bettering America. Bingham has even considered inviting Sinclair into the administration as Secretary of Commerce. The rest of the cabinet advise that such a move could hurt the President's perception among the people after the droves of anti-Pacific propaganda we issued. Vice President Amlie suggests that the EPIC Plan be adopted nationwide, but stop short of making him an official. Others still believe any association with Sinclair or his plans would betray Bingham's vision for a socialist America led for the middle class and create a slippery slope of allying with other former socialist  figures regardless of their allegiances.

Of course, the war is now behind us, and Bingham bears no ill towards his old friend for siding with the Syndicalists. After all, it was Dewey who taught Bingham the importance of having pragmatism. In fact, the President wishes to formally rehabilitate and reward Dewey for his decades of service to the country by bringing him into his administration. Most of the cabinet agrees, suggesting Dewey and other Bellamyists be sent as an advisor to develop and ideally, promote our policies, in the Red Belt. In this post he could educate and help administrators in the region to better implement policy by employing his many great ideas. While Bingham supports sending Bellamyists to the Red Belt, he is more partial to having Dewey specifically oversee education in the country. Dewey is best known for his work in education reform, and this would effectively hand him the reins to complete his vision of transforming educational institutions into progressive services that will advance society and promote constant intellectual growth, concepts that Bingham has long admired. Many are still skeptical about giving a former traitor this much power in the country, and some of Dewey's detractors implore the President to reconsider rehabilitating Dewey altogether and let him continue his work outside of government.

In the aftermath of the tragic death of President Huey Long, Earl has used inspirational rhetoric to encourage the country to get back on its feet and heal from the grief the loss of its great President has provided. The younger Long echoes the charismatic speaking style of his brother, and is just as popular with the crowds in need of a strong voice promising them a better future as Huey was. Despite what his detractors have speculated, Earl has begun to step out of the Kingfish's shadow through his words. The new President notably focuses less on policy promises, instead focusing on filling his remarks with jokes, anecdotes, and homely sayings to cheer up and entertain both the populace and himself. This wave of speeches has won over millions who now believe that not only can Earl fill Huey's shoes, but that he is also his own man, a strong leader in his own right."

unionstate.5117.d:0 "President Smith was preceded by Huey Long, a great man who did much for this country, who defended the American people from the evils of socialism, liberalism, elitism, wealth, and the outside world. However, Smith has declared that his dream and his work was marred and compromised by a sinister cabal of 'Jewish actors' at almost every turn. Long may have won the Civil War, but he lost the ensuing peace and his life to those who seek nothing less than the destruction of American society. But President Smith has declared that he will not repeat the mistake of his predecessor and hero, he will not be the next 'Victim of Zion'. In a fiery speech, Smith has declared that 'Americans must take the fight to the Jews before they can bring us to ruin, and to do that, we must strip them of their greatest weapon: wealth'. President Smith has issued an executive order that high-level bankers and other economic elites shall be targeted and separated from their profits. Furthermore, the final blow shall be dealt as the Financiers reel from their losses. The bankers, industrialists, and executives shall be arrested, subject to trial, and by God's will, rightly imprisoned. This will ensure the cabal can pose no further threat to the good Americans of this country. With assets in the hands of the government, President Smith will be able to complete Long's work, and continue to fulfill the Lord's mission for America."

unionstate.5118.d:0 "President Smith's latest executive order represents the culmination of Smith's 'efforts to fight back and resist domination by the Elders of Zion'. Under the President's watch, the nation has already moved in freeing itself from 'those who hold it back' and wish to 'sabotage good Americans'. However, President Smith has declared that 'it is not enough to simply jail the Jew or separate them from their wealth', and that the Hebrew still 'poses a threat to our institutions, our people, and our very nation'. Smith has declared that if America is to complete what the late President Long started, we must expel this 'fifth column faith' from our borders. With this new executive order, the Smith administration has called for a 'Second Exodus', in which the Jews shall be exiled from this country. Headlines from the American Progress highlight the many  neighborhoods who rejoice and celebrate as the deportations begin. Others, fearing the reprisals, can only mourn the loss of their neighbors, friends, and fellow Americans quietly. For the Jews themselves, there is only despair as they say goodbye to the land of the free, and the hope that wherever they may end up, they can be free at last..."

The elites of America have for too long been free and to corrupt the nation into a safe-haven for the greedy profiteers of rotten modern capitalism! One of the few admirable private sector leaders, Henry Ford, argues that Coughlin should focus on finishing President Long's work in toppling the head of the 'Jewish beast' in Wall Street and in the major industries of wealth and prosperity are to be in the hands of all Americans. However, the publishers of the American Progress  advocate for a focus on combating their enemies in the entertainment industry. Museums, film, festivals, amusement parks, theatre, opera, even Coughlin's beloved radio are trades dominated by sinister 'Jewish actors'. According to them they use these forms of entertainment as propaganda to lie to the people and present a considerable threat to our efforts to implement and uphold the policies of the National Union for Social Justice.  If we continue to allow these actors to corrupt the minds of God's children, the horrors of commercialism and the sophistry of greed and of individualism may never be vanquished. Without question, it is too dangerous to tackle both forces at once. The populace could turn on his quest to bring God's Social Justice to the country if we seize the wealth and imprison both the robber-barons in entertainment and the giants of banking, food service, manufacturing, transportation to have their wealth seized and jailed. Who shall we target first?"

unionstate.5120.t:0 "The Coughlin Question"
unionstate.5120.d:0 "It's no secret that Coughlin has had political aspirations for as long as his radio show was on the air. His apparent interest in leading the once-again united America is now more clearly shown than ever, as he has begun lobbying for changes to the Union's requirements for becoming President. Born in Canada in the late 19th century, he is, according to the Constitution, not eligible to run. However, the bill proposed would allow those with at least 10 years of citizenship and residency in the United States to legally become Commander in-Chief. The bill's proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some claim that the 'political revolution' brought on by Long and his followers should see new radical changes to how the government is run, and that America should use this opportunity to allow Americanized immigrants to become President, given they've taken time to serve their new country. The next bloc takes a moderate approach. They recognize Coughlin's obvious designs on power and claim that due to his 'exemplary service' during the war to Long and the Union State, he should be given an exception and be allowed to run for President. Huey himself has been in favor of this resolution, seeing it as a fair compromise. Finally, the last group considers itself the most fundamentally true to the old U.S., claiming that 'the original genius of the Founding Fathers', that being the Constitution, shouldn't be altered in any way. They also see the bill as a potentially slippery slope that would allow dangerous foreign actors to wield far more influence in politics than before. These three interest groups have come to a head, with different figures tacitly supporting whichever side aligns best with them, and others outright ignoring it. The results of the vote are as follows:"

His fascination with Latin American history led to an expedition to Peru, where he discovered the now-famous site of Machu Pichu. After raising seven sons, including Alfred Bingham, and exploring the world, Hiram Bingham III could have been satisfied with an eventful life. He did not stop there however; his political career took the shape of Governor and then Senator from Connecticut. He served in these offices for years, and when the Second Civil War began, he aligned himself with New England. Despite their often strained relationship, Alfred has a soft spot for his father, and we must decide what should be done with him. Many are clamoring to have him arrested like other traitors, though he has done little to justify this action. Another option would be to send him back to Peru, this time as a diplomat. This would get him out of the way while also allowing him some dignity. Of course, we could just leave him alone, as he is elderly and poses little threat..."

unionstate.5122.d:0 "President Smith has announced the construction of a museum dedicating to the life, ideas, and legacy of the great President Huey P. Long. The Public Works Administration has contracted a team of the finest architects, engineers, historians, low-level AFP bureaucrats, and even academia from the Louisiana State University to build a site fit to commemorate and celebrate Long. Numerous recordings, papers, correspondence, memorabilia, and other materials have been donated by the Long family, associates of the late President, and the America First Party. Historian Harley Bozeman, a close confidant of Long, has directed the operation, and has worked to ensure that every piece of the museum contributes to the goal of remembering Long's accomplishments, ideals, and portraying Huey as the champion of the poor, great leader, and he virtuous man he was. A grand opening is scheduled for the next August 30th, Huey's birthday. While progress continues smoothly, controversy has emerged regarding the way the project will be funded. Left leaning members of the AFP advocate for the museum to be tax funded, which they argue is the least contentious and most convenient option, considering Huey's popularity and our already high tax rate. Rose Long and her family has requested that they be allowed to raise funds for the site, and while this is likely to be extremely successful and could potentially even raise support for the Party, Smith would much rather have himself or one of his key allies lead the fundraiser than a family he sees as rivals. Henry Ford and Secretary of the Interior Meade McClanahan have quietly persuaded Smith to consider having Jewish citizens pay for the project. They frame the issue as one of the Jews needing to give President Smith and America reparations after one of their own murdered Huey Long. After all, the President has already gone so far as to detain famed Jewish Louisiana architect and frequent Long collaborator Leon C. Weiss when he offered his services to the project for suspicions of embezzlement and connection to Long assassin Carl Weiss. This would simply be the next best step in ensuring the Jews don't get away with their heinous act scot free. Regardless, the museum must be paid for somehow, and a decision must be made."

unionstate.5123.d:0 "The America First Party has just experienced yet another power struggle as Mayor of New Orleans and close confidant of Huey Long, Seymour Weiss, has attempted to wrestle away control of the Party from President Smith. Pointing to his association with men such as Henry Ford and James Eastland, Weiss has denounced Smith as a traitor to the late Kingfish's vision and a man unfit to succeed him or lead the good people of America. He has even dared to ask major party leaders to join him in voicing opposition to Smith so that they can put in place a new President that will restore the original purpose and ideals the Party once boasted, when the opportunity arises. Weiss' political rebellion was quickly put down following a series of scathing speeches in which the President has attacked Weiss. Smith has asserted that Weiss worked to sabotage Huey Long at every turn, leading a Jewish conspiracy to stop Huey Long from freeing the poor people in America from elitist forces. This conspiracy was responsible for most of Long's more questionable policies and, ultimately, his tragic assassination. Indeed, his Jewish last name is shared by Long's assassin, Dr. Carl Weiss, proving their connection and cementing the allegations as the truth in the eyes of Smith and his supporters. Tensions peaked as battle erupted in the French Quarter of New Orleans at one point, with mobs of enraged citizens threatening to exact revenge on Weiss for the death of Huey clashing with police. This morning, President Smith announced the arrest of Seymour Weiss, officially ending the fight for control. He commented, "It is abundantly clear that Mayor Weiss is guilty of murder, Judeo-negro collaboration, a wide variety of perversions, promoting jazz, thievery, treason, corruption, and tax evasion, and it is my expectation that he will be brought to justice."A mayoral election has been scheduled in New Orleans.

In public, the two leaders emphasized the common values of the new China and America in protecting the welfare and freedom of all classes of their people. Privately, talks are said to have proceeded extremely well. While the two leaders do not entirely see eye-to-eye, the ever-pragmatic President Hu was able to find much common ground with his counterpart. Hu, using his excellent English that made negotiations much easier, congratulated his counterpart's administration on its successful and peaceful socialization of the country, excellent living standards, and "first class" education system. Bingham in turn expressed his immense admiration for the Federalist cause, their efforts to bring true republicanism to China, and Hu's willingness to incorporate progressive ideas despite leaning to the right. Thereafter the two quickly bonded over their experiences as two of John Dewey's most successful students. Indeed, it is reported that the two spent over half the time exchanging stories from their time with Dewey and the philosophical beliefs they developed. With the limited time they had left, the leaders hurriedly but productively got to work securing a trade deal between their countries. Returning to the public, Hu and Bingham together promised to lower tariffs on the others goods, protect each other's shipping on the seas if endangered, and exchange think tanks and other non-profit groups. The summit concluded with Hu and Bingham gifting the other one of their works, An Outline History in Chinese Philosophy and Insurgent America; Revolt of the Middle Classes, respectively.

It was here that Coughlin grew his support, and in a Protestant community no less. It was also a site of a KKK cross burning, an action which angered Coughlin, who thereafter opposed the organization. Now that the war is over, Coughlin has turned his attention to his old stomping grounds. His attention has come at just the right time; a recent renovation of the site finished after fire damage destroyed the old wooden structure of the building in 1936, and now, Coughlin has designated it as a national shrine. The church, much larger than before, is now nationally renowned and stands as one of America's finest churches."

Though Coughlin reportedly leans towards jailing such people, some in his administration have urged him to reconsider, instead insisting that they merely be removed from any government positions or other areas of power. This act would target men like Alfred Mitchell Bingham, Bronson M. Cutting, Sid McMath, Joseph C.O. Mahoney, and more. For their part, these men have protested, noting that they are neither syndicalists nor communists, and insist that Coughlin stands down.

These powerful Louisiana figures represent a godsend for Earl Long, who has struggled to shore up support in state governments around the country, with many still unconvinced of his ability to succeed his brother. The Old Regulars under their new Longist leader, Robert S. Maestri, have begun to change that impression.

The President and Secretary of the Interior Meade McClanahan have dreamed of construction their "Sacred Project" ever since the Civil War concluded. Upon taking office, Smith quietly commissioned sculptor Emmett Sullivan to make this dream a reality and lead the construction of a life-sized recreation of ancient Jerusalem as it appeared in the time of Christ. The Springfield Plateau within the Ozark Mountains on the border of Arkansas and Missouri was chosen for its stunning geographic similarity to Jerusalem. There a massive team was assembled to carry out the project, and over the next several years progress was reportedly steady, but strained. The President himself donated over $1,000,000 to the project from his own pocket and raised much more, but rumors of the Jewish population being coerced to "gift" great sums to the creation of the New Jerusalem were pervasive until the mass deportations of the Jews. Indeed, a massive statue of Christ was built to overlook the city, representing the Christian victory over the Jewish and Roman forces that occupied Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the work is done, and the President has officially opened up the city for the good Christian public to enjoy! Upon entering, however, visitors were shocked to learn that the "city" was more of a Jerusalem styled Christian theme park. Artworks are in every building, the center of the metropolis holds an amphitheater where the Passion of Christ is retold. Even more startling were the "Museum of Earth History", exploring the true, creationist history of the world, and the rollercoaster ride depicting Jesus' journey carrying the Cross up to Calvary Hill. Surprisingly, despite subverting expectations, the site has had a very successful first day. Numerous attendees left feeling reinvigorated, thrilled, and even more devout! Tourism in the Ozarks is expected to boom, and President Smith is most pleased."

Sweeney, a Catholic herself and well known in the Irish-American community, began her rise to stardom by denouncing the Irish gangs in Boston who, inspired by President Coughlin's rhetoric, terrorized the Jewish population of the city. Her advocacy helped to raise awareness of the extent of the antisemitism of the city and convince the Mayor of Boston, James Michael Curley, to provide greater police protection for the Jewish neighborhoods. Her passionate work was eyed with cautious optimism by AFP officials hoping to potentially sway her to become a voice for Coughlin's wider agenda. However, Sweeney was not content to deal with Boston alone. In her rapidly expanding paper, she has criticized the America First Party as a corrupt organization and President Coughlin as a man who has strayed from the Church and distorted the Lord's message. In her scathing articles, Sweeney has openly called Coughlin an anti-semite and demanded for him to stop subverting the liberties of fellow Americans and our “elder brothers in the faith”, who have endured much of the same oppression that Catholics in America have. Indeed, her threat is so great that at every single AFP event she protests, her followers grow larger."

unionstate.5131.d:0 "Cardinal O’Connell of Boston’s excommunication of Sweeney was expected to quell her dissent, but only inflamed it. More and more progressive Catholics and people disillusioned with the administration have endorsed Sweeney and joined her efforts across the nation. President Coughlin has decided he had enough. After Congress passed an act transferring Sweeney’s assets and the Boston City Reporter to the government, Minutemen reportedly raided the headquarters of her newspaper. Charged with “actions aimed at undermining national security” and “subverting federal authority.” Sweeney’s trial was little more than a kangaroo court, thanks to executive pressure. After a brief month of proceedings, Frances Sweeney was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason. Despite Sweeney’s young age, her health has rapidly declined due to rheumatic heart disease. With her life expectancy low after only barely surviving a heart attack this morning, Sweeney’s supporters mourn their defeat, and many Catholics and Jews quietly reflect on the life and work of the brave young journalist and question what is next for the country. For now, however, President Coughlin has gotten one step closer to realizing his great ambitions for America, and celebrates the peace from overcoming this upstart opposition."

To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"

Naturally this has attracted a large amount of criticism while also appealing to former Democrats and racially conservative Republicans despite Pelley's claim the Ward System is 'radically different' from the ODP's Segregation platforms. Perhaps speaking out against it can increase our percent of the black and liberal votes, although it does threaten to drive away some voters."

After several meetings with his advisors the President believes he has come up with the ideal plan for this, a nationwide barnstorming tour with members of the Christian Party and the Silver Legion. Seen live, broadcast both on radio and recorded to be shown after the fact, the Silver Cavalcade as it is now being called internally will surely spread our message further than ever before."

unionstate.56.t:0 "Jewish Segregation?"
unionstate.56.d:0 "As our platform is implemented more and more, one of the President's more controversial ideas has again reared its head. In Pelley’s mind the influence of the American Jewish population on both the capitalist and syndicalist systems and the growing population of politically aware Gentiles necessitates that they need to be stripped of certain rights for the time being, ostensibly for their own protection. Under the plan the Jewish population in each state would be moved to a single city until the Commonwealth system is fully implemented, at which time the President promises they will again receive full rights. Regardless of his promises though the idea has attracted outrage from a not insignificant portion of the population who claim it will lead to mass abuses and other rights violations, and on the other hand the hardliners in the Christian Party are demanding an immediate implementation of the plan. It seems like no matter what choice we make could cause us further problems in the future."

Allen's wing of the party as well as the increasingly controversial Gerald L.K. Smith it espouses radical racialist doctrines and promoting ideas such as the mass expulsion of Jews from the United States, these groups are increasingly harming the Presidents image and one way or another we need to make a choice on how to best handle the situation, with Willard Kemp offering to help reign them in via private conversations and threats of expulsion."

Known under several different names in prior years, Soulcraft Doctrine as it is now known has seen a slow but steady growth under the Pelley administration. Whilst the President has suspended any new publications on the matter to avoid First Amendment cases, prior works such as the Golden Scripts are being sold in higher numbers and more and more people seem open to exploring the President's ideas on not just politics and economics, but spirituality as well. Of course, this has also caused ridicule from papers such as the L.A. Times who mock Pelley as a 'guru', making many in the party reluctant to push the matter further."

In the years before he assumed the Presidency Pelley acquired a long list of contacts in several fields, particularly in finance, industry and politics, through his authorship followed by his leadership of the Silver Legion. Whilst our programs are being speedily implemented and the Chiefs vision of America becomes truer by the day it might be wise to call in these favors and outstanding debts, even if it might appear unpopular to the masses."

unionstate.5900.d:0 "Due to his campaign promises, the Pelley administration is faced with a controversial idea that needs resolved. In the past, now President Pelley spoke of a system that in his eyes would allow the government to best help and uplift its most impoverished citizens. Known as the Ward System, the idea would see those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and be brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and would deny them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. While in theory the system would be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing some have expressed outrage and compared the idea to modern slavery. The President calls these claims outrageous and a step forward from the old Jim Crow system but a choice must be made on the matter immediately, with challenges by ACLU and NAACP lawyers as well as the opposition parties making the mainstream of the CP more reluctant to endorse it."

Recently the President organized a showing of several of the films he helped make in his heyday at the White House and afterwards he announced a number of executive orders seeking to cleanse Hollywood of any anti-American sentiments and sponsoring the opening of new studios so that Americans may once again enjoy cinema if Hollywood did not 'clean up its act' at once. Much of the right-wing of the CP is pushing for him to simply implement these policies now however and Pelley would prefer it that way, although many in the cabinet view it as too radical."

President Pelley certainly doesn’t think that’s the case, having for several years written about the plights of various Indian groups and peoples and the attempts by various groups to seize their lands or turn them to beliefs like Syndicalism in an effort to manipulate them.

Having mutated Theosophist thought into their own unique offshoot occultist movement that adds to the pool of traditionally accepted Masters of the Ancient Wisdom by stating that Ballard is just a reincarnation of the Ascended Master Godfre alongside other former lives of he and Godfre like Richard the Lionheart and George Washington while his wife holds similar ideas and honors as an Ascended Lady Master Lotus while having lived previous lives as Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I of England, and the great Benjamin Franklin of whom is the center figure in Pelley’s own Franklin Prophecy which formed the foundations of his own ideology and that claims that European Jews funded the Knights of the Golden Circle to guide John Wilkes Booth to kill President Lincoln in order to take revenge for Benjamin Franklin's supposedly covered-up anti-semitic speech that tried to warn America about Jewish Migration to the Union and its effects, the duo also claims to be the sole ‘accredited messengers’ of Saint Germain along with their son Edona Eros ‘Donald’ Ballard after Guy supposedly met a reincarnated form of the Count of St. Germain while out on a hike through nature at Mount Shasta in 1930, which granted him the enlightenment needed to form his ‘I AM’ movement with his family - a movement initially populated largely by early Silver Legion members and which has since become the foundation of Pelley’s own Theosophist views that partially formed the basis of his varied and syncretic ideology. \n\nNow practicing a heavily bastardized form of radical Protestant Christianity fused with their tweaked Theosophist background and the varied esoteric ideas of the late Pelley, the Ballard’s lead the fringe wing of Pelley’s Christian Party alongside fellow mystics and occultists Harvey Spencer Lewis and Paul Foster Case - both devoted Rosicrucians like Pelley before them and more in tune with Pelley’s own brand of specific strangeness outside of Theosophy in the metaphysical realm of spiritualism and the occult, but they still lack any expertise in Pelley’s other interests like pyramids, ufoism, and Pelley’s own ideas of soulcraft and dark souls, which all would require staying loyal to his ideas in full to fully maintain. However, with this diverse coalition of esoterics being so flighty with their ideas, we must hammer out a specific platform for the Christian Party going forward while also determining how much of Pelley’s own strange beliefs to keep around."

Should the Ballards and their I AM activity make some form of public declaration of support to the old Pelley partyline, promising to not wander too far from the late Chief’s wisdom and prophecy, or shall we let the Ballards take on a new identity all their own while continuing to pay lip-service to Pelley’s legacy as they transform the Commonwealth to meet their needs as they toil away at building a new America built on theosophic iconography and the mercurial, pastel, and dreamlike aesthetic of the Ascended Masters and St. Germain they so cherish? Alternatively, a third but controversial option exists that seeks to find a compromise between the sides by appealing to the Old America aesthetic of the Christian Party and the Commonwealth wit the theology of the I AM movement under the Ascended Masters in a new form of the normal Star Spangled Banner cleansed of its Red, crypto-Syndicalist agenda and design, and instead blessed by the holy yellow light that accompanies the genius and wisdom of our Theosophical deities, though this seems to have angered more normal, everyday Americans who see it as a desecration of the failed state the Founding Fathers first formed while lacking full backing from either side of the political debate.

### Texas-AFP Events ###
unionstate.5903.t:0 "Reaching out to Capital"
unionstate.5903.d:0 "One of Pappy O'Daniel's most ambitious desires is to bring the business community together with the poor farmers and workers he represents, and to find amicable compromises between all parties involved. Thus far, O'Daniel's attempts to reach out to big businesses both within the Union State and without have been met with failure. Businessmen have shown distaste for the faction representing the same populist values of men like William Jennings Bryan and "Fighting Bob" La Follette Sr., and O'Daniel will have to work hard to make such men feel comfortable in the country. To do so, we have a range of options. We could further cut taxes on businesses, encouraging them to come to Great Plains states, in particular Texas. However, such cuts may be unpopular with other parties and allow them to cut into our support base. We could also target certain industries, from finance to construction to the oil industry, in the hopes of increasing their interest in our country. This would be easier to accomplish, but will obviously benefit us less. What shall we do?"
unionstate.5903.a:0 "Move forward with business tax cuts"

unionstate.5904.t:0 "O'Daniel's Five-Point Plan"
unionstate.5904.d:0 "Today, Pappy O'Daniel brought his plan for America's economic recovery to Congress. His five points include $40 million in new revenue, the abolition of the poll tax and of capital punishment, the appointment of a state-appointed budget director, and an amendment banning deficit spending. Though he was initially optimistic about the passage of the entire plan, it met some opposition from left-wingers in the AFP and the NPP who claimed that it was nowhere near enough to solve the current crisis. Further, while the Christian Party largely supported the proposals, Gerald K. Smith and other right-wing AFP members opposed the legislation, with some arguing it was too liberal and others arguing it went against everything Huey Long had fought for. As such, we may need to cut some of the proposals from the bill, but which proposals should be cut?"
unionstate.5904.a:0 "Cut the amendment to ban deficit spending"
unionstate.5904.b:0 "Remove the contentious proposal to raise new revenue"
unionstate.5904.c:0 "Get rid of the clause about capital punishment"

unionstate.5905.t:0 "The Debate over Pensions"
unionstate.5905.d:0 "One of O'Daniel's most persistent promises to his supporters was the implementation of old-age pensions for the nation's elderly population. As such, he has been eager to push this proposal and codify it into law, but it seems that his political inexperience has limited him in this pursuit. O'Daniel failed to even gain the support of some of his fellow Texan congressmen, with the questions of how this pension system will be funded still unclear. For his part, the Texan leader is apparently frustrated at this setback, but he pledges to carry on with his agenda nonetheless. Instead of an old-age pension system, he has instead begun to formulate a plan for post-war America, in which pensions will be granted to veterans as a way of easing the country, or more accurately, his fellow politicians, into the idea of pensions for all elderly citizens. This "Dependent and Disability Act" will be just what O'Daniel needs to push old-age pensions forward."
unionstate.5905.a:0 "Crooked politicians!"

unionstate.5906.t:0 "The Dependent and Disability Act Passes"
unionstate.5906.d.pappy:0 "The events of today were the culmination of years of planning on the part of W. Lee O'Daniel. Today, a form of O'Daniel's proposed pension program has been passed through Congress, and it is popular enough now that though he has largely abandoned any hope for pensions, his people cry out for them as a necessary form of relief. The most difficult part in passing the act was finding the source of funding for it, but due to his high popularity, he was able to force the implementation of a 1.6% tax on business transactions into law, providing more than enough funding for this program. O'Daniel does not plan to stop here, and in fact, he hopes to renew his push for elderly pensions as well. Time will tell whether this proposal succeeds, however."
unionstate.5906.d.other:0 "Today, the Dependent and Disability Act was officially codified into law. The successful passage of the act marks a victory for [TEX.GetLeader], who had helped push for this act as a way of thanking the patriotic veterans who made victory possible for the Union State. Now, veterans will get the relief they deserve."

unionstate.5907.t:0 "Repay the Hillbilly Boys"
unionstate.5907.d:0 "Pappy O'Daniel's "Hillbilly Boy" band was instrumental in getting him elected as leader of the American Union State. Now, with his position secure, the members of the band expect some sort of reward for their loyalty, and O'Daniel is happy to give it to them. However, we must decide how we wish to go about this. We could grant them even more power in the government than they currently hold, meaning more positions for them in the cabinet. Alternatively, we could make them fabulously wealthy, and keep sending them on tours around the country. Do we need these men in government, or around the country?"
unionstate.5907.a:0 "Bring them home!"
unionstate.5907.b:0 "Send them out to boost morale!"

unionstate.5908.t:0 "Economy in Government"
unionstate.5908.d:0 "One of W. Lee O'Daniel's promises was to bring "economy to government". By this, he did not mean that the government would be more concerned with economic issues. Instead, he meant that the corrupt politicians in Texas, the Great Plains, and the country as a whole had used spending they promised to their people for their own gain or purposes, while the people suffered under their rule. One of the worst instances of this misuse was last week, when O'Daniel was informed that $1 million for orphanages was instead being siphoned off to pay for party machine costs. Another instance was when $3 million meant to help buy new tanks apparently disappeared, and such instances are not uncommon. O'Daniel believes this wasteful spending to be distasteful, inefficient, and worst of all, immoral. However, to get the spending of our government officials back on track, should we..."

unionstate.5909.t:0 "Tax Law Controversy"
unionstate.5909.d:0 "From the very beginnings of his political career, Pappy O'Daniel has had a desire to slice taxes for his people and give them the ability to spend again. However, he has met significant opposition from the left in this endeavor. Mainstream Longists have protested that such cuts, particularly on the wealthy, would go against the ideals of Huey Long. Meanwhile, those in the NPP argue that these tax cuts are merely an excuse to make the Union State more attractive to wealthy investors. O'Daniel has not denied this charge, happy to admit that he wants more investment in Texas and the country as a whole, and he has even shot back that anyone who does not want such investment is as bad as the politicians who got us into this crisis to begin with. \n\nRhetoric aside, though, it is apparent that O'Daniel will have a hard time forcing his ideal tax laws through without tweaking them. Should we decide to cut poll taxes, we will surely gain the support of leftists and the common people, while slicing taxes on businesses will likely bring more investment in our economy, regardless of the state of the nation's politics or military."
unionstate.5909.a:0 "Cut poll taxes!"

unionstate.5910.t:0 "An Opportunity Arises!"
unionstate.5910.d:0 "With the war over and O'Daniel's programs beginning to win the hearts and minds of Americans, it is a better time than ever to attempt to push for the fifth part of O'Daniel's five-point plan. It may seem like a minor detail to some, including O'Daniel himself, but his supporters will hold him to it. If we can push this legislation through Congress, O'Daniel will be remembered for both reconstruction and his own plans. Should we move forward with this policy?"

unionstate.5912.t:0 "Collected Western Stories of Robert E. Howard"
unionstate.5912.d:0 "The current revival of American culture has been followed by the renaissance of Westerns as a genre of literature. One interesting case of this is a collection of short stories by Texas writer R. E. Howard, which have just been released. These stories, like 'The Pride of Bear Creek' or 'Pistol Politics', focus on describing adventurous life in the American Frontier. Stories about gunslingers such as the Sonora Kid are especially popular in this genre, appealing to a wide swath of readers. This does not mean, however, that the author wrote Western stories only in this narrowly understood subgenre. Literary works such as the adventures of the Texan traveler Francis Xavier Gordon in 'The Coming of El Borak', 'Hawk of the Hills' or 'The Country of the Knife' or even horrors stories such as 'Black Canaan'  or 'Pigeons from Hell' are all part of the Western genre, even if they are less traditional. Meanwhile, the popularity of Howard's Westerns is now so great that no one remembers the rest of the literary attempts to create other pulp heroes, such as the boring Conan the Barbarian or the naive puritan Solomon Kane."
unionstate.5912.a:0 "Robert E. Howard will be remembered as the Father of Westerns"


unionstate.5913.t:0 "Racial Segregation in Trade Unions"
unionstate.5913.d:0 "Until recently, the demands of some trade unions were too far-reaching. Postulates of non-American and non-Christian initiatives, probably inspired by immigrant conspirators from syndicalist Europe, are not only a threat to American values but also harmful to the entire economic system. These includes issues such as desegregation in workplaces or the equalization of wages of White and Colored workers. The abolition of the unions would, of course, be harmful, as it would leave workers vulnerable to crooked politicians. A promising solution to this problem was proposed as early as 1924, by the unionist Samuel Gompers. He claimed that 'the Caucasians are not going to let their standard of living be destroyed by Negroes, Chinamen, Japs, or any other.... If the colored man continues to lend himself to the work of tearing down what the White man has built up, a race hatred worse than any ever known before will result.' For this reason, he suggested creating separate trade unions only for White Americans. Keeping blacks from joining trade unions would increase the influence of Whites in the government by strengthening the power of the workers' strike. Interestingly, even the extremist William Z. Foster had such remarks in the past. In 1920 he called blacks 'a race of strikebreakers'. So a firm decision must be made. Will we maintain segregation in the new trade unions or allow racially mixed unions to function?"

unionstate.5914.t:0 "Curriculum at American Universities"
unionstate.5914.d:0 "Universities are forging our young minds. As such, they are an important institution for the next generation. However, academics in our country must not be infected with anti-American or subversive thought. Some academics in fields such as social sciences, anthropology and the humanities have been known to transmit progressive and even harmful ideas to their students. Some even see a sinister influence in fields such as modern physics or biological sciences. The simple fact is that free and uncontrolled universities can become hotspots for subversive thought under the pretext of academic freedom. To combat this, Pappy O'Daniel plans to put favorable representatives on the Universities Regents Councils to control what is taught. Although some criticize this project, others, including Coke Stevenson, even encouraged more radical action including the removal of defiant professors."

unionstate.62.d:0 "John Dewey was a member of the social patriots in the CSA but who was sympathetic to us and repeatedly pushed for peace with the American Union State, and many of his adherents were among our own ranks as well. As such, his followers believe we should take the opportunity of refitting the education system to apply his theories of hands off teaching and self-learning to our schools, which they believe will better prepare our children to become citizens.

The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibition Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibition Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

unionstate.78.d:0 "After the end of hostilities in Washington, a large section of the conservative Democratic Party pledged their allegiance to [Root.GetNameDef] and to the ideals President Long follows. Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."

unionstate.79.d:0 "Despite our best efforts to incentivise officers to remain in their positions during this very sensitive time, approximately one hundred army officers have expressed deep reservations for Huey Long's trial. The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within.

unionstate.80.d:0 "The Dixiecrats, who we tipped off about the 'arrest' of Long, have been useful in maintaining the facade that is Congress. The tedious process of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers.

unionstate.101.d:0 "After a long reshuffling of former US departments, the American Union State has uncovered old classified weapons proposals. The two proposals that caught the most interest are ones authored by Robert Goddard and Vannevar Bush, each proposing an expensive weapon project to deter invasions. Fortunately, both men were recovered from their respective hiding places, and persuaded into updating their proposals. Goddard's plan is for a liquid fuel rocket to deliver stable explosive payloads across long distances. Vannevar Bush's is a theoretical utilisation of nuclear fission to create a bomb based on experiments done in Europe. Which plan should we pursue?"

unionstate.302.d:0 "As unrest over wartime conditions advanced from the frontlines, past the Mid-Atlantic, and into Maryland, the Vatican Volunteers took the opportunity to begin an uprising, with the goal of storming the city of Baltimore.\n\nCrossing into the city over the river from Fort Armistead, under heavy fire, the volunteers came on ramshackle barges for the most part. However, with the aid of Catholic elements in the city, the Papal Militia was able to land at Sparrow's Point, and rushed headlong into the teeth of the enemy resistance along the riverside. The troops then split their forces and cunningly used the cover of back alleyways and side streets, advancing inward as the main forces battled the enemy across the main boulevards and through city parks. At the crescendo of the fighting in the city, the Papal volunteers, in a display of near-suicidal bravery, at once advanced on the enemy forces entrenched on Gulford Avenue outside City Hall.\n\nMeanwhile, sympathizers to our cause, with the aid of a number of local volunteers, Catholic or otherwise, charged the barricades, overwhelming local law enforcement forces, causing many of them to simply break rank and flee. While many militiamen lost their lives in the fighting, including the heroic sacrifice of the militia leader, Father Emilio Arandes, the city has yet to fall. Luckily, reinforcements under the leadership of Union State officers stand poised to take the area if they can beat back the forces now rushing to save the city. Only time will tell what the outcome of the conflict will be, but some within the High Command are already angry with the impudence displayed by the militia, with an anonymous officer stating in private that "this war is our war, not their personal crusade""

unionstate.303.d:0 "A vigil was held for the late Father Arandes in Baltimore today as members of both the Papal Militia and the local Catholic community arrived to honor the sacrifice of the volunteers who have given their lives in the ongoing uprising in Maryland. Among those in attendance beside the memorials to Arandes was a pious dignitary from among Maryland's Catholic elite. Philip Acosta Carroll, a federalist officer with deep Longist sympathetic and an patriotic and deeply religious supporter of the Papal Volunteers, has replaced Arandes as leader of the Baltimore Uprising. Giving a speech at the vigil, he now hopes to win the battle for Arandes and the millions of American Catholics.\n\nCarroll has the distinction of being a direct descendant of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, known to history as one of America's Founding Fathers. As the only Catholic signatory of the Declaration of Independence, not to mention a man hailed as the principal financial supporter of the American Revolution, many historians credit the institution of Freedom of Religion in the Constitution as a means of honoring the contribution of a Catholic's diligence and charity to a largely Protestant country's war of independence.\n\n Now, hundreds of years after the American Revolution, the United States stands at the forefront of another revolution, and it is here, as before, that Philip Carroll, like the Lord of Carrollton before him, has pledged himself to us, the clear rightful government. In accordance with recent communiques with the Vatican, Carroll has formally assumed leadership of the Papal Militia, ready to lead the Catholic faithful in taking Baltimore and America as a whole, fighting to the last against the scourge of the Syndicalist and Stratocrat alike.\n\nThis news has been met with an immense upswing in support, causing a massive swell in donations and volunteers for the uprising in Baltimore, and it may just be enough to ensure victory for Carroll. However, if Carroll should fail to take the city, plans are being drafted to help him and his fellow officers retreat west to the more stable holdings of the Union State. Regardless, there have also been volunteers elsewhere for the American Union State, both for the Minutemen and the Carroll's Papal Militia, this will no doubt put us one step closer to victory!"

unionstate.304.d:0 "With the end of the Second American Civil War, the Papal Volunteers, seeing a surge in popularity for their role in consolidating America under [TEX.getleader], have begun an effort to reorganize themselves to be better able to continue to aid the American people in the post-war era. To that end, their commander, Philip Acosta Carroll, along with a high-profile cabal of devout Catholics from the political theater, have announced the formation of the Holy American League. The League itself is a non-profit organization dedicated to the values of faith, hope charity, the spreading and protection of Catholicism, diligence and the American spirit.\n\n Within this new coalition, Carroll and his militia have surrounded themselves with a posse of political elite. One of the more well known figures is New York Governor Al Smith, the Brooklyn-born democrat credited with a reputation as a venerable elder statesmen. It is hoped that Smith's moderate reputation would help legitimize the League in the eyes of the Senate and Congress. In addition to Smith, among the founders of the League, most controversially, includes woman's suffrage activist and known socialist sympathizer Dorothy Day, who is herself most known for her relationship with the SPA. While we have been comparatively lenient in allowing Day to continue to operate within America, the League has still garnered a great deal of public criticism for Day's history with the CSA. Day's involvement might explain the strange absence of the loudest and most obvious supporter of American Catholics, Charles Coughlin.\n\nWhile Coughlin himself was quite loud and ardent in his initial support of Carroll and the volunteers, the alignment with Day has turned Coughlin into the League's most scathing critic. He has verbally ripped apart the League on his radio show, stating loudly that he will oppose any measure that seeks to uproot the sanctity of American faith. Beyond this, rumors of Carroll's own alleged ties to both the NYC Christian Front at home and various Integralist or traditionalist Catholic movements abroad circle around the League. Despite these rumors, little proof, beyond Carroll defending the Christian Front as Lawyer, can be provided, making them seem quite unlikely, although Carroll has never denied them."

unionstate.305.d:0 "As the first step in the Holy American League's plan to aid in the reconstruction effort of America, Philip Acosta Carroll, in concert with Al Smith and Dorothy Day, has begun establishing humanitarian aid camps throughout the eastern seaboard. From Baltimore to Miami to Baton Rouge, the volunteers under Carroll and the League have set about distributing food and water, providing medical aid, and setting up hospital camps. Along with this, efforts have been made to aid the Reconstruction of the west coast, although to a much smaller degree then in the east, due to the League's lack of a true presence out West.\n\nFurther, they have begun conducting religious services and education for children, cleared rubble, and in the Black Belt, many African Americans have found refuge with the Catholic volunteers. These volunteers tirelessly labor to heal and rebuild the Black communities damaged by the war, openly forsaking and condemning the racial violence suffered by the Black minority in the South and fully embracing the unity of Black and White Americans.\n\nAs one might imagine, this sentiment was not received well by the Dixiecrats of the Southern political elite, who protested Huey Long's leniency with the League's sphere of influence spreading so far south. Many of these critics are beginning to align with Gerald L.K Smith about the Catholic presence in the South, and even Charles Coughlin, despite his militant Anti-Klan stance, can't help but look at the League's increasing influence with African Americans with skepticism. Nonetheless, the efforts of the Holy American League have very much impressed [TEX.getleader], who publicly praised the efforts of Philip Carroll and the League for helping to stitch America back together again."

unionstate.306.d:0 "Ever since the founding of the Holy American League, they have done their best to provide aid to destitute Americans. Now, the League's militiamen and humanitarian workers have seen a huge increase in support across America, with many New Englanders, Texans, Pacificans and African Americans in the Deep South flocking to the ranks of the League. More importantly, the increase in popularity of the League also coincides with an increase in religious conversions to Roman Catholicism throughout America.\n\nInevitably, this was going to lead to a confrontation with the most conservative Protestant elements in America. Spurred on by both Gerald L. K. Smith's rhetoric and the remnants of the Klan, increasingly frequent incidents of violence between the League and the mostly Protestant population have been reported in the Deep South.\n\nIndeed, much of the Christian right in America are furious at what they see as the encroachment against traditional American values and claim that the presence of the League, whom they decry as 'Papists', are part of a conspiracy enacted by the Vatican to purge all Americans who refuse to submit to Papal Autocracy.\n\nWe must watch these groups, for they are preaching that the League's favoritism of the negro population is an obvious ploy to usurp the authority of the White Man. Already, reports of vicious hate crimes and atrocities have begun to surface, some as far north of the Black Belt as Virginia, and as far west as California. The situation appears to be rapidly spiraling out of control; many former Old Democrats and even influential Louisianan and Texan politicians are complaining to [TEX.getleader] personally about what they see as the League's arbitration.\n\nAll of this presents a difficult dilemma to the President, as much of his support is reliant on the conservative Protestant farmers in the West and South, and as such, the crisis must be handled with delicacy and tact. In other news, Charles Coughlin's weekly radio broadcasts have been postponed for undisclosed reasons."

unionstate.307.d:0 "With the current situation in the country becoming ever more tenuous, a meeting was called today. President [TEX.getleader], General of the Army Jacob L. Devers, and Christian populist Gerald L. K. Smith were called together. Amidst a storm of accusations, posturing, and fingerpointing as to whom did or didn't do what, a solution arose to the issue of the Holy American League that seemed a far more extreme measure than Long had anticipated, and yet, it might be one of the better options available to him.\n\n Smith has proposed an Anti-Catholic Bill, the beginning of a means to counter the influence of the growing Catholic influence on the population. In short, the bill greatly restricts the Immigration of Catholics, adds extra taxes to Catholics, taxes the Catholic Church itself, and would bar Catholics from holding public office. This measure would also help in artificially limiting their influence within the American government. Smith remains adamant that the League's modus operandi is to seize control of the State and turn it into a puppet state loyal to no authority but the Holy See. While the President was quick to dismiss Smith's ramblings, Devers' concerns about Carroll and the League are much more realistic.\n\nDevers does, indeed, agree that it is unlikely that a conspiracy by Rome is ongoing, however, he points out that Carroll himself, from an outside perspective, seems to be positioning himself as a potential leader for the Catholic minority. Further, he is also positioning himself as the voice of minority rights of those oppressed largely by evangelical protestants in the nation, combined with the alliance between Carroll, Al Smith and Dorothy Day, Devers postulates that this would be a powerful force.\n\nWhile maintaining that any sort of armed coup d'état is unlikely,  Philip Carroll is possibly positioning himself to run for President to unseat [TEX.getleader] in the next election. Furthermore, even though Devers claims that the unrest in the South can be easily brought into line with some well-placed peace keeping forces, perhaps combined with applying pressure to convince Charles Coughlin to support the League to help foster better relations between the League and other Christian groups, it might also be in our interest to, if Carroll's influence is indeed growing, to consider passing the anti-Catholic bill to ensure a comfortable majority in the polls."

Heavy rainfall swept across Washington D.C, with the crack of thunder heralding the dawn of a new era over the continental United States; a new era under the old order.\n\n Only a small contingent of military police sat outside the Capitol Building, a measure to ensure the safety of the President's entourage on arrival. [TEX.getleader] was present as was Gerald L. K. Smith along with General of the Army Devers. Their purpose that night was to briefly oversee the deliberation over the new Anti-Catholic Bill being considered, arriving well ahead of the congressmen. Despite the eerie emptiness of the building once inside, the President's inner circle was certain that the night would conclude decisively. Their assumptions would be proven right.\n\nThe last anyone saw of the President and his cabinet was in Smith's office, where the three men sat, laughing, joking, and drinking, cavalier at their impending success, listening to the broadcast of Charles Coughlin's radio show, the first one in a long while. Father Coughlin spoke of the impending Bill that sought to curtail his faith, and in so doing, usurp the faith that defined not only his identity, but that of a large, and growing, minority of the country.\n\nAs his show for the night came to a close, the last words that came over the radio were: "My wrath will flare up, and I will kill you with the sword; then your wives will be widows and your children orphans."\n\nThe Capital Building of the United States, the spitting image of American democratic values, then erupted in an inferno as crate after crate of high-grade explosives detonated in the sewers below. Long, Devers and Smith, and a scant number of the Minutemen, were incinerated in the blast, the former seat of the United States Congress completely burnt to cinder.\n\n By the next morning, coalition forces of both the Minutemen, under the command of Father Charles Coughlin, and the Holy American League, under the auspices of Philip Carroll, seized control of the White House just as similar elements consolidated power in Atlanta, St. Louis, Houston, Sacramento, and New Orleans. By that afternoon, radio communiques with General of the Army Terry Allen Sr would affirm the peaceful transition of command of the armed forces to the administration of the coalition government of Carroll and Coughlin, and by evening, Philip Acosta Carroll would be sworn in as the new President of America."

unionstate.309.t:0 "An American Monarch?"
unionstate.309.d:0 "With the rise of the Holy American League, the question of what the League's governmental reforms will entail have begun to manifest. Many people have drawn correlations between the Holy American League and the various other Integralist movements throughout the world. All of these movements contain similar values despite their cultural differences. The primary values are an ardent nationalism, a strong empathies on Catholicism, and an intense antipathy for liberalism. Above all, is a desire for societal and cultural restructuring around the guiding hand of a monarch.\n\n The prospect of the American people accepting a return to Monarchy is, to put it mildly, hard to believe. Between the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and American history, it has been shown that Americans do not look on strongmen favorably. At the same time, however, the civil war has proved that one man's strongman can be another man's savior.\n\n To this end, the coalition of Coughlin and Carroll have granted their combined authorities to the Holy American League, which has gathered together in Congress at St. Mary’s City, birthplace of American Catholicism, to consider the future. Already, several proposals to maintain Republicanism has been rejected due to, as President Carroll aptly notes, being the ”spawn of Satan, that was shown for what it was as the Weltkrieg torn down the idol of Republicanism.”\n\n Only two of the proposals in this Congress have made any traction with the members assembled there. The first and perhaps most radical of these proposals is indeed the restoration of a monarchy, but not under any temporal king, rather the enthronement of Christ as King of America.\n\n While the proposal is radical, it makes sense from a Catholic standpoint. The Universal Kingship of Christ is a teaching of the Catholic Church that states that all nations are under Christ's Kingship. Thus, enthroning Christ as King  would simply be a recognition of what is already the case.\n\nThe other proposal that is gaining traction also includes the recreation of a Monarchy, but under the House of Stuart, the last Catholic Royal House of England. This proposal, while also radical in its own right, makes sense in a geopolitical and historic sense. It is well known that enemy number one of the Holy League are the Windsors in Canada. By crowning their historical rival, the Stuarts, we would legitimatize an invasion.\n\nAs the First Congress of the Holy American League begins voting, it is clear that..."

unionstate.310.d:0 "In an event that left many Americans dumbfounded today, President Philip Acosta Carroll, Father Charles Coughlin, and the Holy American League led a joint declaration announcing that America, indeed, be transitioning to a form of monarchy.\n\nThe astonishment of the majority of Americans, counter-intuitively, did not stem from the concept of a monarchist America, but rather, the declaration from Carroll and Coughlin that none other than Jesus of Nazareth shall be the King of America. As it stands, this new political policy has shocked millions, millions who expected a president, chairman, or dictator perhaps, but never a king.\n\nFurther, in a similarly confounding statement, Philip Carroll announced that he would, in fact, be resigning as the President of the United States, instead assuming the title of Regent. This title of 'Regent,' as the name suggests, mean that Carroll shall be ruling in Christ's place, granting him nigh absolute control over the government.\n\nReactions to this declaration have been, to put it mildly, perhaps as varied and mixed as they have ever been in the former United States: many Americans, even those among the Christian faithful, are flabbergasted at the notion of the apparatus of state being granted to an ethereal being in the form of the Judaic Son of God.\n\nMeanwhile, the markedly more outspokenly cynical critics of the Holy American League have openly denounced the move as a nakedly obvious and even delusional attempt to galvanize the religious population in America under the clerical dictatorship of Philip Carroll. For the faithful Catholic however, this moves is not unexpected. According to the Church, Christ the King is King of all nations, and America is simply the first to put Him in his rightful place. Besides this, how Carroll intends to legitimize this seemingly insane decision to the rest of the population remains to be seen."

One such site of major import to Carroll's initiative is the site of Saint Mary's City, the original colony of Catholic settlers along the Chesapeake Bay. It is the first settlement of what would form the county and eventually, the state, of Maryland, and is credited as being the origin point of American values of religious freedom.\n\nIn the centuries since the American Revolution, Saint Mary's City now functions as little more than a tourist attraction: the descendants of the original settlers have long since moved on to the more populous regions such as Washington DC or Baltimore. Now, with the beginning of Carroll's initiative to reinvigorate the old colony, new construction projects for the development of the city are planned.\n\nThese are part of an economic plan based on an obscure Syndicalist-designed development scheme originally intended for the state of Nevada, but now it will be initiated in the former Maryland hamlet. The goal will be to utterly transform it into a shining gem in the heart of the Mid-Atlantic region, even though the initial estimates place the project's completion as late as 1954.\n\nIt is becoming clear to many, based on the sheer scale of the endeavor, that Regent Carroll is determined to make America into a nation as pious as it is prosperous. Something to be admired in something more than mantra, and if the plans for Saint Mary's City are any indication, America is likely going to look very different in the near future."

unionstate.312.d:0 "It was the humanity of Catholic farmers, ranchers, and workers across the country that allowed for the Holy American League to start the long and hard process of rebuilding America's body and soul. With the continued threat of the terrorism on the horizon, the American people are wary, and many Catholic converts have taken to forming citizen guards to protect rural communities from such opportunists.\n\n The irony of the situation was not lost on those they protected, as one might imagine; much of the suffering of Catholic Americans can be traced to the very Protestants or other groups they worked to protect. The rise in popularity of these AD-HOC militias, known to these rural communities as "Knight Watchers", might mark the beginning of real change in America; Catholic and Protestant Whites have been more supportive of one another than ever before, and many communities in the Midwest and Great Plains have found a semblance of peace in the ashes of a once great nation.\n\nWhile it will still take some work before America is restored to her previous glory, the role these Knight's Watchmen had to play will not be forgotten."

unionstate.313.d:0 "With the development projects in Saint Mary's City underway, the Holy American League has begun it's process of proselytizing the faith of the Catholic Church to communities along the eastern seaboard, via the state sponsoring of the Society of Jesus.\n\nThe primary leadership of the League has exerted a great deal of effort in preparing for this; Al Smith has taken to meeting with the state governors in the mid-Atlantic to coordinate the efforts in helping to spread the gospel; Dorothy Day and her Catholic Worker Movement has been campaigning in the factories in every major city along the east coast, championing the word of Christ in the workplace, and Charles Coughlin, wild and irreverent as ever, has been touring the Carolinas and the Virginias to speak at rallies across the Deep South.\n\n The clergyman have been whipping up a storm with nationalist southerners in support of the League's mission, and all the while, Philip Carroll has personally been involved with the process, taking cues from Father Coughlin and engaging with the people of America over the radio, in a series of so-called "Fireside Chats" with the common people, serving as the light to Coughlin's heat, the demure Marylander speaking candidly of the world's events and America's role in them. The Jesuits, the main 'men on the ground' for this grand conversion of America, has greatly thanked the government for it's efforts, as no doubt by seeing their leaders in this fashion, the process of conversion will be all the easier.\n\nIndeed, it is a massive undertaking on the part of the League, but more importantly, it clearly the very beginning of the effort to legitimize his administration in the eyes of the general populace. This is but the beginning of a series of conversion efforts, starting with the east coast and then working their way westward, until the entirety of the continental United States, from sea to shining sea, stands united under the gospel of the Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit."

unionstate.314.d:0 "As the Holy American League continues its project of breathing life into the American economy, a raucous debate has surfaced within the League as to the specific plan for revamping the American financial sector. The origin of the schism within the League stems from activist Dorothy Day and venerable New York governor Al Smith, both of whom still continue to work for the betterment of America, despite their necessary alignment with the comparatively extreme Integralists within the League.\n\n Day, whose mere presence within the League has been a point of contention since it's foundation, argues for transitioning the American economy to the model of Distributism. Distributism is a communal form of economic decentralization based on values of sharing and charity, where a country's production would be widely owned by the populace instead of by private enterprise, or in other words, Three Acres and a Cow for all.\n\n Naturally, such a measure of collectivization has scared the pants off many of the more moderate members of the League, Al Smith chief among them. Smith champions 'Christian Capitalism' and argues that a free market is of vital importance to the American economy, even invoking Charles of Carrollton's role in the Revolutionary War as a principle argument in favor of the preservation of private enterprise.\n\n Not wanting to be mistaken as showing favoritism to either side, Philip Carroll has delegated the decision of which economic model to adopt to the dictation of Father Charles Coughlin, whose enmity for the leftist Day and liberalist Smith is well known, and would likely favor whatever economic plan he felt would be most practical for America's future."

unionstate.315.d:0 "Over the past several months, with the increasing prevalence of Catholicism over the American psyche, a strange phenomenon has begun to occur. What originally began with the Knight Watchers, those brave volunteers, devout in their adherence to God and fervent in the ideals of equality and solidarity with their countrymen, has rapidly blossomed into a multi-pronged phenomenon across the country. These groups have begun adopting the pledges, titles, iconography and customs of full-fledged Knightly Orders in the fashion of the old European crusaders.\n\nIn Maryland, the birthplace of American Catholicism, urban youths from Washington, Baltimore, and the resurgent Saint Mary's City have organized themselves around the personal teachings and mantra of Philip Carroll and his family line as part of the eponymous Knights of Doughoregan Manor. In New York City, the austere and indomitable African Americans from the five boroughs have chosen to honor the bravery of the Harlem Hellfighters with the official formation of the Brooklyn Brotherhood. In New England, throngs of haughty, red-haired Irish Americans have flocked to the patriotically self-styled Antitemplars in defiance of the decedent king in Canada. In the Steel Belt, once the heartland of the Syndicalist Menace, there have been a plethora of men and women from Chicago, Detroit, and Cincinnati, many of them medical workers, who have joined the new Red Hospitallers.\n\nA similar phenomenon has sprouted up in the American southwest, along the border states with Mexico, militias have founded the Old Sonora Charter in honor of those who fought against the socialist Mexican government. Along the Pacific Coast, what started with a number of white volunteers in Oregon and Washington soon began to incorporate a growing number of Native-America converts to defend the nation from internal and external threats in the stalwart Order of the Heartland.\n\nAll of these groups of patriotic, pious soldiers, these modern day crusaders, have humbled Philip Carroll in their embrace of God's teachings, so much so that he has immediately enacted a decree to officially absorb these orders as an official part of the armed forces. They serve locally and abroad as a sterling example to all of the cultural unity and martial tenacity that God has brought them."

What's more. all religious services and rites observed by the Catholic Church shall be observed by students. For these students, scholarships for Theology, Sociology and Philosophy shall be offered to strengthen the moral fiber of the American youth. Charles Coughlin and Philip Carroll's radio broadcasts will be mandatory listening for young students in Catholic schools, and finally, all forms of racial segregation in schools will be abolished by both the State and the Church.\n\n These are just the start of the League's educational reforms, and while it will obviously take time for the new teachings to take root, Philip Carroll and the League are confident that the next generation of American youth shall be the ones to see America flourish, both on the world stage and beyond."

All institutions of the continental United States, from the office of Regent down to the roles of the Civil Services, shall incorporate Christian oaths of service and loyalty upon hiring. All hospitals, fire stations and police departments shall incorporate Catholic priests into the workplace to moralize and sanctify the civil services with the blessing of Christ.\n\nThe Roman Catholic Chaplain Corps, a long standing branch of the American military, shall be granted special status within the armed forces to function as part of the newly created office of 'Christian Commissars'. Along with this, the Archbishop of Baltimore, the greatest of America's Hierarchy, shall be granted a permeant position in the cabinet, as 'Spiritual Advisor.'

They arrogantly built monuments to the golden calf of Liberalism, even as they fattened themselves on the slavery and suffering of the common people, all in the name of their so-called liberty.\n\n All across America, statues dedicated to the old American idols of Liberalism and Democracy are being torn down: Lady Justice, the embodiment of judicial corruption, has herself been judged guilty. The nigh endless statutes of American folk heroes and founders, these grotesque monuments to poisonous Enlightenment thought, shall be torn down and replaced by visages of the blessed Saints and Martyrs.\n\n Last of all, the  repugnant pale-green monument to the false god of so-called 'Liberty' disgracing the skyline of New York City, a gift to the Freemasons of America from the Freemasons of France , or rather, a statute to satiate the egos of the American oligarchs  and their Jacobin cohorts, a revulsion against the new American spirit. Regent Philip Acosta Carroll, in his pious wisdom, has decreed that the so-called "Statue of Liberty" shall no longer continue to persist; the limestone fresco shall be entirely remade, reforged into the visage of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a tribute to the King of Kings and Lord of Lords; Christ Jesus."

unionstate.320.d:0 "The time has at last come for the undoing of a great injustice on the American continent, that traces itself back to the very foundation of the nation. For centuries, the Catholic and Protestant population of America lived together in harmony, working side by side to turn what was once the 13 Colonies into the super power we are today. But that was when America was weak, and America is now strong. The Protestants have finally seen the truth of this, and have begun to be converted to the One True Church, albeit slowly.  Yet still, there are those who rebuke Our Lord, and it is a rebuke that shall not be ignored any longer.\n\n There are the Evangelists; sick, demented, old criminals who corrupt their fellow Christians in archaic, obscene doctrines of racial superiority and moral decadence. There are also the Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, Quakers, Puritans, Mormons and more. Even worse, are those who convert to the Faith, but continue to spout their blasphemes, hoping the eyes of the Church do not see them. All them are a blight, a taint, a corrosion of the perfect, incandescent American Spirit, and we demand compensation for this insult. By order of Regent Philip Acosta Carroll, like Cortes before him, we shall conduct the first American Inquisition; from Seattle to Miami, the country shall be made to kneel, to confess.

unionstate.322.d:0 "The murmurs of a conspiracy in the White House to return to a form of Monarchy have been proven true. The Holy American League has announced that the nation shall be reformed into a semi-constitutional monarchy, along German lines. Naturally, despite the preservation of the democratic system, at least in some form, the news did not go over well with the majority of the nation, due in no small part to historical ardent opposition to monarchism. Despite the intense opposition to this move, the potential for Carroll to legitimize this move might lie with the chosen candidate for the League's new America.\n\n Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba,is the chosen pretender to the new American crown; once the Foreign Minister for the ailing King Alfonso, the amiable, affluent Spaniard is the most senior living descendant of King James II via his illegitimate son James FitzJames, whose devout faith in Catholicism lead to his unlawful exile. It also led to the rise of the House of Windsor, presaging the infamous Jacobite uprisings across Ireland and Scotland. Even today, there are some in Scotland who believe Jacobo to be the rightful heir to the Kingdom of Scotland.\n\nWhile this history might seem superfluous, there is a realpolitik reasoning for crowning a Stuart. Not only does supporting the Jacobite claims to the British Crown cunningly sidestep the role the monarchy itself had in the violent suppression of our ancestors, allowing the blame for said atrocities to be placed on the House of Windsor, but also do so in away that would garner support from the European-descended population in North America. Many Irish, Scottish and even Hispanic-Americans are finding cause with Carroll's Integralists in their alignment with the Celt-Iberian aristocrat, supporting the League's attempt at European inspired monarchism in a manner that is paradoxically pro-American. Despite the creation of a Monarchy in the Prussian fashion, it appears that President Carroll intents to remain in power. For even as King James III is crowned, Carroll has made the King's first act to create the position of Regent, granting the holder of the title all powers that King would posses. Seemingly the price for his crown, James III has appointed Carroll has his first Regent.\nRegardless, this trend of Americans supporting monarchy may be as unexpected as the Spanish Inquisition, but it is a welcome change, for we will need all the support we can get if we are to recover from the current crisis.

Everyone from the holy Inquisition’s representatives and their own security forces, to moderate and reformist politicians who are keen to see what the chances of representing their factions in the congress will be. The crowds are being slowly vented through strict security checkpoints manned by the army and the Inquisition so the assembly goes as planned. Reporters and crowds supporting their preferred faction all eagerly wait to see their representatives arrive, all the while the Knights of Columbus stand sentinel on the steps of the congressional building. We shall soon have a new Archregent to rule in place of Christ the King, God Willing."

cathdeath.3.t:0 "Holy American League Congress - Economic Debate"
cathdeath.3.d:0 "The Holy League’s Congress has to be the most politically diverse climate in North American history, as each representative seems to have their own ideological beliefs and agenda’s. No where else is this more prevalent than in the economic debate, something that news reporters and journalists were spinning themselves in circles going over, It would be even more confusing had it not been that politically similar politicians have come together to represent their bases as a unified front in the debate.  The Reformists who wish to change or even get rid of the distributist economy to something more favor-some to their practice. The Moderates are fine with our current set up and wish to continue Phillips old system. While the  Hardliners want to centralize the economy, some are even going so far as to wish for a type of 'Feudalism with American Characteristics'"

cathdeath.4.d:0 "While the economic debated was heated, both the reporters and even the politicians within the congress could not have seen the heat from the governmental debate coming. As the debate first begin and the first speaker, a woman from the Reformist faction, walked onto the podium they would not last but a minute until someone, believed to be a representative from the Inquisition’s side of the Hardliners, throw a shoe at them. While the shoe missed, it caused a great uproar, leading to the female representative being thrown out of the congress. Regardless,  the Reformists are championing a campaign in favor of decentralization, with some supporting the old federalist model while others seek an almost anarchistic approach to control. The Moderates want to return to that of a trusted system like the AUS had, with more or less populism depending on the person within the faction.The Hardliners are seeking a strong government with centralized control, so they can give power to either noble knights or that of the Inquisition's never-ending hunt for heretics."

cathdeath.5.t:0 "Holy American League Congress - Inquisition Debate"
cathdeath.5.d:0 "The debate has shifted to the rather controversial subject of the Inquisition. Many of the Empire’s citizens live in fear of the Inquisitors, and with good reason. The intense and brutal punishments dished out to those found guilty of heretical behavior or thought are now infamous. For this reason, the Reformists argue for doing away with what they deem to be an outdated, immoral, and unnecessary practice. Meanwhile, the Moderates advocate for toning down the excesses of the Inquisition while retaining the basic test of faith. In stark contrast to the other proposals, and much to the horror of most of their fellow party members, the Hardliners call for strengthening the Inquisition and removing the limits to its power. This would in effect give the Inquisitors free reign to hand out whatever punishment they pleased on whoever they pleased, but the Hardliners nonetheless insist it is a necessary step in cleansing the Empire into a truly Holy state more fit to bear the name of the Virgin. Now the Congress waits with bated breath to find out who shall get their way."

This seems to be a major victory for those who supported systems opposing the AUS in the civil war,even if they technically haven’t taken complete control they still managed to secure their foundation. for now at least. However they are far from unified, as the faction is still split between Al Smith's federalist christian base that supports a capitalist system and Day's anarchist distributists and the moderate distributistic minded reformists of Bishop of Chicago Bernard Sheil.

Soon enough, an Army Chaplain marches outside the congressional building and shouts to the crowds outside as loud as a pious man could, “THE MODERATES WIN!”.  The devoted crowds that support the old cause cheer as word spreads, however inside the congressional building there is one last vote.

While on the steps of the congressional building senior Knights of Columbus began patting and speaking to each other in congratulation. The announcement was silent yet no words were needed, The Hardliners had won.  The inquisition is now in charge of America.

The Military is rapidly moving back to barracks outside the city limits or to reinforced checkpoints.

The nation is on the verge of collapse as a mass exodus of people are leaving the city as conditions rapidly devolve with gangs and paramilitaries fighting each other in the slums of the city. The military is marching on the city, as their flight to their barracks proved to be a regrouping action rather than a true rout. The military commanders  are attempting to install Joseph P. Kennedy  Jr as Archregent, their motives seeming to only be inspired by a desire for order within the nation. With word spreading from frontline reporters of the hardline inquisition units firing on civilians loyal to any group rather than their own and lynch gangs from both the reformists and moderates seeking each other out, the military seems to be driving an almost reckless advance straight to the center of the city right through the ideologically inspired groups.

London, the former capital of the most powerful nation on earth is now but a burning husk, both from our own conquest and the unending riots engulfing the city. In order to help solve these problems, and ease the worries of his subjects, James III has decided to visit London, much to the chagrin of Regent Carroll. With his mind made up and his first true exercise of power in opposition to Carroll having been made, His Majesty has already charted a flight to London. Although Regent Carroll is obviously angry at His Highness, he has suggested  James heavily beef up security, as whispers of a plot to kill the King are apparently already afoot..."

While she is indeed over 18, her youth, and inexperience could be disastrous for us. This had lead many to consider that the time is not yet ripe to crown a successor to James, not while the world is still burning. Instead they propose to establish a regency council to govern the nation until the time is right.

Following this close incident, James III has agreed to return home to Washington.

Serving as herald to this new dawn is none other than [TEX.GetLeader], newly elected regent of this holy American empire. Famed for their work in Catholic circles as well as socialist ones, they stands as the most liberal, left-leaning hierarch in the Empire. Under there guidance, the promised land that is America shall be blessed with the light of Catholic Socialism and communalism. Though many within the nation distrust her over their leftist views and ties to organizations such as the IWW, none can deny their unyielding determination to reduce the plight of America’s downtrodden and poor. With the rest of the reformist wing of the Holy American League behind them, [TEX.GetLeader] shall transform this war torn nation into a truly gleaming and prosperous city on a hill."

cathdeath.16.t:0 "A Portrait of Reformist America"
cathdeath.16.d:0 "As the Archregent’s new legislation and reforms take effect, their vision for America has slowly begun to take shape. In a balanced, syncretic fusion of Socialist ideals and Catholic faith, [TEX.GetLeader]'s agenda has already resulted in beneficial outcomes for the American people. Pious worker-priests hold sermons after their shifts end, Catholic-Socialist foodbanks, clothing deposits, and other charities are widespread, with many receiving direct subsidization from the state itself. Minorities and females have been given expanded rights, and social-welfare systems have been expanded greatly; all under the direction of Archregent [TEX.GetLeader] and the rest of the Holy American League. Though many conservatives still fill the government, they have begun to soften their stance, if only minorly, towards the new Archregent as these policies prove their effectiveness over and over again. In this weird synthesis of Democratic Communalism, Socialism, and traditional Catholicism, America has truly found a unique governmental setup that seems to work for the majority of our citizens. Though far from perfect, the new regime has put our nation well on the track towards full recovery from the horrors of war, famine, and civil strife. Whether or not this success continues, is up to [TEX.GetLeader] and their allies."

To this end, a new successor has finally been chosen to replace our martyred leader, and that new successor is none other than Al Smith. Long known for his piety, dedication to religious freedoms, and strict adherence to democratic traditions, Smith has won the day and is now in charge of the Empire. With the rest of the reformist wing within the Holy American League, Smith hopes to revive true federalism and democracy within the nation, returning to some semblance of normalcy when compared to the old American system now left to rot in its grave after the conclusion of the Second American Civil War. While his plans for federalism worries many within the League, especially our more conservative or zealous members, Smith has promised to adhere fully to the established soul of America, declaring he shall not lead our people into a dark and uncertain future, but instead to a warm and familiar destiny that has awaited the American people since our nation was first founded almost two centuries ago."

cathdeath.18.d:0 "Through perseverance, determination, and perhaps even divine intervention, America has somehow not only managed to right its course, staving off further chaos, but has also managed to go further than any previous regime in the pursuit of bringing true democracy and liberty to our people. Smith has kept his word as the federalist structure of the old United States has been brought back from the brink of total death. Shedding the sins of the old regime’s past, certain changes to the original system have been made to ensure the nation’s continued piety and stability. For instance, the Constitution has surpassed its old standing of reverence and is now treated as a sacrosanct document, with some of its original writing being tweaked quietly behind closed doors to emphasize the latent pro-Catholic rhetoric the Holy American League claims has always been within the document’s subtext. The former United States have been transformed into a truly pious, virtuous, and liberal capitalist democracy while still maintaining its deeply conservative and traditional Catholic roots. Under Archregent Smith, this holy Empire’s future has never been more free and devoted to both Christian values and Federalist liberties."

cathdeath.19.t:0 "Restore the Parties?"
cathdeath.19.d:0 "Since the reign of our now martyred Archregent Carroll first began, political parties outside the Holy American League have been, in effect, completely muzzled. Forcefully absorbing the standing political parties such as the Democrats or Republicans, Archregent Carroll did so to preserve the fragile political system left in the wake of the horrific Civil War. Now, with a new Archregent ruling over these lands and the factionalist turmoil that split this nation apart now having subsided, the question over what to do with these illegalized parties has now resurfaced. The two main camps of argument that have formed over this debate are between the Reformists and other more liberal wings of the HAL, who advocate for a fully dismantling of the Holy American League’s oppositional coalition, while the more conservative camps, that decry this move as factionalism and an attempt to sow discord through out ranks. The final decision shall be up to the Archregent, with their decision holding the future of America’s democratic traditions in the balance."

And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.’ These words, from the gospel of Matthew himself, ring true within our borders now more than ever. With the labors and works the Reformists of the Holy American League have put forth and endeavored upon, these former United States have never known such peace and prosperity. Arm in arm, our people march together towards their brighter future, with the Archregent holding the beacon of the Lord’s holy light for all Americans to bear witness to and follow. Together, the Meek have inherited the reigns of power."

Long having been Carroll's preferred and hand-picked choice to succeed himself should anything happen to him, Sheen has followed through on the late Archregent’s final wishes and now leads the Holy American League as the new Archregent of America. Hoping to carry Carroll’s torch, Sheen plans to complete Carroll’s unfinished vision for America, with some slight slants to a more democratic system; a move Sheen views as both necessary for stability, as well as being what is truly best for the American people. Like a new St. John carrying out the divine will of Carroll and the Lord, Sheen shall become the shepherd that leads this weary flock towards its destiny."

But once it is remembered that love of neighbor is inseparable from love of God, it is seen that love of our fellow citizens is a form of piety.’ These hallowed, wise words warmly filled the airwaves of nearly every home in America as radios and televisions across the nation broadcast the weekly fireside chat from the beloved Archregent Fulton Sheen. ‘In these days when so many subversive activities are at work, a reminder of the necessity of loving our country is very much to the point. Consciously or unconsciously our citizens are grouping themselves around only a few possible ultimate answers to the questions vexing our country,’ the old soul carried on, like a caring father teaching his own kin, captivating the people of our great nation with his silver-tongued words on unity and praise. The highlight of tonight’s speech was his declaration on our task as Americans - ‘It is our solemn duty as Catholics, therefore, to be conscious of our duty to America, and to preserve its freedom by preserving its faith in God...’ With these strong words hanging in the air and within the thoughts of our people from coast to coast, Archregent Sheen bid his audience a farewell as he signed off until next week’s chat with his signature closing line:..."

One man has the vision, the faith, and most importantly, the connections, to lead the country. That man is Father Charles Coughlin, and he has plans for the country now that he is the official Archregent. First and foremost, since Coughlin was affiliated with the original 'Share the Wealth' program, it seems he is interested in reviving it in one way or another. Just what this plan will entail is, as of yet, unknown, but what is known is that Coughlin's faith and conservatism are just what we need to stabilize the country."

cathdeath.24.d:0 "From the beginning of his time as Regent, Father Coughlin always served the people. It was the common man, the farmer, the worker, the small townsman, that he worked and fought for. Now, having had the time to accomplish many of his most important proposals, the country has taken notice. For instance, Coughlin has campaigned for better workers wages and protections of unions, and in the meantime, his popularity has soared. However, the country has yet to fully recover from the Great Depression, and it seems that even Coughlin's programs have been unable to significantly improve the economy. So, while we live in uncertain times, the American people can sleep easy knowing Father Coughlin rules with their interests in mind, and with that knowledge, perhaps we can continue to rebuild."

cathdeath.25.t:0 "A Test of Faith?"
cathdeath.25.d:0 "Few could have predicted that the United States of America would ever be a majority Catholic nation, but that is precisely what has occurred. The fallout from the Great Depression and then the Second Civil War left many looking for answers, for meaning, and for justice. In this atmosphere, millions turned to Catholicism as a source of strength, seeing their leaders and communities embrace it as well. However, as with any such mass conversion, it is unclear whether we can trust the veracity of these new converts. As such, perhaps certain tests are in order, so that we can better ascertain the faith of all Americans who profess to follow our faith. While the considerations for the test vary from asking Americans to pitch in to support the Church to seeing who is attending Mass, what we do know is that we must come up with some way to figure out who is true to the faith and who is not. At least, this is what some advisors argue. Others say that we have always been an open nation in terms of our faith, and that perhaps we should be magnanimous in our approach. After all, we are the majority faith now, and any attempts to force it on Americans may come off as weakness. What should we do?"

Regardless, the moderate supporters of Carroll have implemented his programs as best they could given the circumstances. Now, after so much time has passed, we can finally say that American is on a path to new greatness. We thank Long, we thank Carroll, and we thank our fellow Americans for their dedication in these times.

His newfound control over the country has had little effect on the mystery surrounding him, but there is one thing he seems focused on above all others. What first began as a program to employ all Americans seems to have developed (or been revealed) as a philosophy of neofeudalism. While Carmody has always been 'the Knight', few could have predicted he would take his interest this far. With the help of his secret police forces though, Carmody has extended his influence -and vision- across the country. The man seems to have more influence than his public demeanor would indicate, and though these policies of societal cohesion and neofeudalistic economics seem radical, they are a welcome change for many who view the old American system as an abhorrent failure. However, some are questioning whether Carmody truly embodies the vision of Carroll, or if he is taking America in an entirely new direction. None can be sure just what will happen next."

Due in part to the semi-feudalistic nature of Carroll's American Integralism, Carmody's feudalism, to the people of the Empire isn't really anything new. What is, however, is the increasing decentralization and efforts to find and empower 'those of noble blood.' Despite all his progress Carmody, always a man thinking of the future, is worried that his reforms will be all but overturned by generations to come. To nip this problem in the bud, Carmody has been considering crowning himself King of America. While seemingly an insane proposal, Carmody has justified himself to his Knight subordinates by saying that if he make himself King, the ideals of Feudalism could not be put down, as the Throne could do all it need to do to protect those ideals. Whenever the fact that Christ is already King is brought up, he further justified his augment by the example of the German Kaiserreich. He says just how the King of Prussia is the Emperor of the Germans, the King of America could be the Archregent of Christ who is King over the entire Empire. Unsound as his logic is, if Archregent Carmody goes ahead with his plan little could be done to stop him..."

Feeney, a conservative Jesuit and, most notably, a critic of the ideas of baptism of blood and baptism of desire, has taken the position of Archregent. Now, as the country stands at the precipice of a new era of religious conversion, Feeney prepares his inquisitors to carry out their most important task yet. They must ensure that all Americans are Catholics, and that those who are not loyal to the faith are ultimately snuffed out. It is no longer a question of whether or not this is necessary, for Feeney himself believes that a failure to adhere to the Church will lead to the failure of the nation as a whole. Of special concern are the nation's Jewish populations, who Feeney believes are perhaps the greatest danger of all to the Catholic Church."

America itself is undergoing a baptism, and the old religious tolerance Americans had been accustomed to has been wiped out entirely. Instead, inquisitors across the country seek out any non-believers, and lawmakers have taken action to snuff out these groups as much as possible. Heavy taxes have been levied on populations not publicly adhering to the Catholic faith, while outspoken Protestants, Jews, and others disappear, seemingly following mysterious visits from inquisitors. In many cases, such non-believers are tried in court and sentenced to prison time. However, in some rural areas, there has also been a revival of burnings at the stake to deal with various crimes ranging from sodomy to freemasonry. Such brutal punishments were unexpected, to say the least, but the inquisitors have carried out their task with ruthless efficiency, and now America is a more Catholic nation than ever, through the fires of war and devastation."

The task of this group would be to deal with non-believers and criminals alike, snuffing out the worst elements of society by whatever means necessary. Giving the inquisitors more funding would certainly strengthen our attempts to convert the country to Catholicism, but it is unclear whether these men would be just in their treatment of non-believers.

Feudalism has also seen a resurgence amongst our more stoic supporters.

We need to do something or we risk falling apart, as one city is a fool's idea of control. Thus the discussion has grown upon our leaders and the peacemakers underneath them, should we just shoot everyone, as the countryside is full of hostile forces? This viewpoint although highly controversial as if it's even possible on the ground with our troops, is strongly opposed by the more calm-headed and peaceful aspects of our leadership. Those within this faction of our leadership think that as a Catholic nation the Word of God must first be used to restore order. "

cathdeath.34.d:0 "Following the deadlock that nearly tore our Holy Empire to shreds, it was one man who stopped the chaos. It was one man who brought focus back, even if it was for a split second to the Congress. It was one man who saved the Empire. That man was Joseph Kennedy Jr, the Savior of America. Archregent Kennedy, despite just coming to power a short time ago, has already begun to make sweeping reforms to the Empire. Him and his 'National Cavilers' has started to transform the Empire into what amounts to a thinly veiled Junta. The Holy American League has effectively become a rubber stamp party in an already rubber stamp body. Those who oppose the will of the Archregent are silenced or worse. The military, long a neglected part of the Empire has become the central focus of Kennedy's reign. Despite his progress in stabilizing St. Mary's City and the capital, the rest of the nation is still in chaos from the deadlock. Unless the Archregent can restore order to the entire nation, he may just be removed himself..."

cathdeath.36.d:0 "The Congress..no..our entire nation, barely lived through the chaos of the deadlock. Now we rule together as the Council of Guadalupe. The Council is little more than an unending congress, made up of establishment and cooperative congressmen that acts as Regent to Christ as one body. It is definitely a peculiar system, however as long as we manage to not favor one side over another, and keep the Council happy and unified we can make it. It seems as if this system may just allow the Empire to not only survive, but thrive."

All the while the people seem to accept this decision, as a group of meek old men in a building hoping for peace is probably better than those who caused the chaos in the capitol. While there is still a fair bit of bickering in the congress, considering there are fewer radicals after the unfortunate chaos in the city that left many dead or missing, we have less to worry about."

cathdeath.100.d:0 "Following Archregent Day's rise to power American politics were changed drastically. Despite being a devout Catholic, Dorothy Day is also an ardent supporter of Anarchism and certain doctrines inherited from the ashes of the Combined States. While this allowed the Socialsit camp to legitimize their positions in the reunified America, more radical members of the Left were dissatisfied with the supposed 'betrayal' of true Socialist values. As such, they began to collaborate with remnant Rightist figures and movements such as the Canadian Social Credit, Silver Legion, the most radical groups within the Holy American League or even certain Dixiecrats. Over the past months, this anger coalesced around the figure of Louis Even, a French-Canadian cleric responsible for introducing the Social Credit philosophy to a wider section of the Catholic population of Quebec. While already the leader of the Union des électeurs, Evan was also responsible for the creation of the more militant Pilgrims of Saint Michael, also known as Bérets-blancs or White Berets. Their message of anti-globalism, destruction of the banking elite, and anti-semitism as a way to create a socially just nation, sometimes even explicitly for a shared 'White' collective, appealed to the disgruntled sectors within our population, leading to the formation of the Revolutionary Pilgrims of America. The group is also said to be influenced by the young firebrand of the Maurrassian movement Pierre Poujade."

cathdeath.102.d:0 "With Arch-Regent Day continuing to pursue her dream of molding America into a true Socialist Kingdom of God, much has been changed on the road to proletarian utopia under the Lord. With political power, the means of production, and the very land we live up transferred to the hands of the people, all have begun to rejoice in egalitarian jubilation, though something has always felt missing. As we have progressed towards a perfected Socialist society through the teachings of God and the interpretation of Dorothy Day, the very American activity of democratic elections has been sorely missed by our people, and so Day has moved forward to organize national elections. Though she shall remain as Arch-Regent under God, the civilian government that rules alongside her shall come to represent the will of the people. \n\nBefore us stands four major democratic coalitions that have any chance at winning in Day’s government. The most dominant of the groups are Day’s hardliners and loyalists organized around ideas of Christian Socialism, Market Socialism, Eco-Socialism, Bellamyite Thought, and Distributism, though they eschew the more radical Anarchist sympathies of the Arch-Regent. Their main rivals are the coalition of Anarcho-Syndicalists, Syndicalists, Anarcho-Communists, and even a few Illegalists united in their loyalty to Day and devotion to the Lord. Standing in opposition to these radicals are the ‘Liberal’ group - a large broad Christian coalition of Social Democrats, Progressives, Left-minded Liberals, and any other democratic group willing to swallow some of their beliefs in order to have any shot at electoral success in this new America. Though they are the largest group, they lack the acceptance within the new government to be as dominant as Day’s faction or the Syndicalists. Finally, the dark horse of this race are the so-called ‘Christian Communists’ - a band of Browder-inspired Socialists united in a wide coalition, sharing more authoritarian beliefs and a shared zealotry to Christian doctrine. With the final votes being counted, who shall win the day and take their place at Arch-Regent Day’s side under the Lord to guide America?"

cathdeath.103.d:0 "As Arch-Regent Smith consolidates the new American nation under his new Republican-style Christian government guided by the light of the Lord, an internal debate within the government has led to Smith being left with a choice of direction. Though his Conservative allies among the remnants of the defunct Democratic Party and other like-minded groups have served him well, there still exists a massive population of Liberal Christians within this nation that share many of Smith’s economic views, making them easy potential supporters. Arch-Regent Smith could potentially choose to incorporate many of the ideas of these Liberals into his agenda in order to garner their support, or he could even dive fully into their ideas in order to secure his popularity among the lower-class masses of America’s heartland. Doing so would alienate his long-held Conservative allies however, so the Arch-Regent must make a choice at these crossroads."

While he nominally has vast powers, Regent Carroll has seen to it that only King's government can truly act with his vast authority. While early on, he did attempt to intervene once or twice, he quickly that the Regent, while accepting his King's commands, was greatly angered by this use of Royal power by the King. Thus, the King has refrained from acting, save for signing bills into law and appearing as the 'public face' of the Holy American League. His Highness has spent his vast free time with his family, helping to prepare his only child and heir, Princess María, for her future role as Queen. At least he did, until just last month when his daughter finally came of age. With her coming of age, the Princess has quickly become a famous face to the public, as she oft seen with Hollywood stars, the nobility, rubbing elbows with the Elite, and the people adore her for this.\n\nWhile this adoration is seen as a massive boon for the royal family, the Holy American League have begun pressing the King, seeking to capitalize on the princess' popularity, to pressure his daughter into marriage with any number of fellow European royals, seemingly to arrange for an international alliance. The King has seemingly been taken aback by this. While a father arranging a marriage for his daughter is nothing new to European nobility, it strikes the King as the wrong thing to do, as she is her own person, not a plaything for politicking. However, his own government is pressuring him and the King is not known for his assertiveness. After much thought and internal debate, James III decides..."

While only being a ceremonial title, the Primate of any given country is the nominal head of the Church within that nation. With Baltimore being the first Catholic Diocese in the United States, it has long been expected that if America were to have a Primate, the Archdiocese of Baltimore would be home to that man. Regent Carroll has graceful thanked His Holiness, proclaiming that the Primate shall be granted an amount of temporal power, to go along with his new title. Besides this, the Church within America has become a buzz with this news, seeing it to be a sign that the struggles with the Orange Order and Klan are almost finally at an end."

While mostly just trappings on top of what these families already controlled, the new nobility also receive government provided protection and a small stipend. Along with this, various tracts of lands have been provided, given they swear allegiance to the Catholic Church, uphold the ideas of the new America, protect the people from harm under their rule, and declare fealty to Regent Carroll, in that order. Along with this, many nobles of the old Mexican Empire, which although outside of our rule, have been granted the same status as the Americans. Even the heiress to the Mexican Empire herself has been granted this status. Until Mexico joins us in Catholic brotherhood however, these families are in essence a nobility in exile, awaiting the reclamation of their rightful lands. Regardless, America is finally home to a true nobility, greatly strengthening the Regent's cause of creating a truly Catholic America."

cathdeath.108.d:0 "Today, in a long and elaborate ceremony in Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome, His Holiness formally canonized Archregent Philip Acosta Carroll. In his speech whereby he made the announcement, the Patriarch of the West told of his life story, how he went from lawyer to warrior, and from warrior to the Father of Catholic America. The Pope also made note of how Carroll's rule, while far from perfect, highlighting many of the excuses and crimes of the early government, he still ruled with Catholic teachings and charity, and provides a model for Catholics who rule over non-Catholic nations. He also pointed to his family, how he reared them in the Faith, making him a model father. Along with this, His Holiness told of the miracle that led to his canonization in the first place. A young woman, a Canadian, was suffering from a horrid cancer, could get no help from doctors, despite their best attempts. The following day, learning of the Archregent's death, offered a prayer to him, asking him to prayer for her in the presence of God, to cure her of her cancer. Within two weeks, her cancer had vanished, which upon investigation by Church authorities, was declared to be a true miracle.\n\nPlacing his feast day on March 10th, Saint Carroll's patronage is that of the United States, and those persecuted for their faith. The Imperial government has already declared the day to be a holiday, so that all of America can honor the passing of their Saintly founder."

cathdeath.109.t:0 "A Family Matter"
cathdeath.109.d:0 "While the nation may mourn the death of our late Archregent and bitter tears may be wept, the ones that truly feel his passing is his own family. A married man since 1923, Archregent Carroll and his wife, Nina, had four children in their time together on this earth. When the civil war broke out, Nina was highly against his husband risking his own life during the Battle of Baltimore, even if it was in the cause of the their shared Faith. When the war ended, Nina had pressed her husband to return to his law practice, a career he put on hold to defend his home, and faith. The Archregent had told her he would in due time, but only after America had returned to normality under the Kingfish. When this eventually never occurred, and Carroll got swept into the world of politics, his wife and family, albeit reluctantly, joined him in his endeavors. When eventually he reached the post of President, then Regent and finally Archregent, his family always came first for him, even when America was in the depths of religious strife, he did would he could to protect them from the ugliest of the action.\n\nWith his passing and with a new Archregent elected, as per official Imperial succession law, the family of the great Phillip Carroll has entered something of a grey zone. While yes, they have great wealth accrued from both before and after their patriarch entered politics, they currently no official standing within the Empire. With this in mind, Archregent [TEX.getleader] has formally granted the family of the late Carroll the noble titles of Lords and Ladies of Doughoregan Manor, family seat of the Carroll since before the revolution. With granting of such a noble title, the Carrolls become entitled to a stipend from the government, along with protection. While this move is a nice gesture, many view it as an attempted to silence voices that call for the Carroll family to inherit the position of Archregent.

In reality, the group is divided as much if not more then the Roman Catholic Church. Everything from the followers of Dorothy Day's more socialistic approach to Catholicism, or the adherents of Father Feeney's strict interpretation of Extra Ecclesiam Nulla Salus, the Holy League is far from a unified whole. By and large however, members of the group typically defaulted to the influence of Regent Carroll, who despite being something of a moderate, has lead the League to following an Americanized version of Lusitanian Integralism. However, even Carroll's Integralism is far from orthodox. The influence of Action Française's Charles Maurras and even the teachings of Padre Pio, can be felt and seen in Carroll and the League's integralism.

For their part, the Holy American League has congratulated the President's handling of the delicate situation, while they continue to aid reconstruction efforts.  Despite this, they have called our efforts only half measures, claiming that when elections come, the League will run candidates for office, to give a voice for America's ever growing Catholic population. Coughlin, even despite the presence of Dorothy Day in the League, during his speaking tour has regained his trust and confidence for the League, pledging to support them in any and all future elections.

While a person running solely on a platform of Political Catholicism winning in America might have once seemed impossible. However, due to the expulsion in the Catholic population since the civil war, due in no small part to the Holy American League, Carroll might have a serious chance at victory.

With us seeking to create a monarchical government here on American soil, this simply cannot be. We can no longer allow such a foolish concept to remain within the foundational document of our nation. To this end, a package of various Amendments, which lay out the framework for our Monarchist state, have been proposed to Congress. The administration of [root.getleader] has begun using a massive amount of government resources to get these reforms passed, which most agree will happen within the next few months. Included at the forefront of these reforms is one formally abolishing the 18th, along with striking Article I, Section 9, Clause 8 from the Constitution . By making these reforms and changes to America's most important legal document, even if they are superficial at the end of the day, we greatly increase our legitimacy.

unionstate.30000.d:0 "Built at the height of his wealth during the 1920s and long before becoming President like he is now, Marland’s ‘Palace of the Prairies’ is his main base of operations. Formally named the Marland-Paris Mansion, this Mediterranean Revival-style palace sits on the outskirts of Ponca City, Oklahoma and at the time of its construction, it was among the largest residences in the American Southwest - an expenditure fueled by Marland’s oil business at a time when he controlled 1/10th of the world’s oil supply. Still an awe-inspiring and beautiful construction, the estate has served as the heart of Marland’s administration, with the President doing most of his work from his ornate office within the Palace rather than at the White House or any other federal building. With tiled roofs, stucco walls, large pillars and arches, and a sprawling garden estate around it, this ‘palace’ would look more at home in Tuscany than it does in rural America. \n\nDespite the glamor of this mansion, Marland still acts as a man of the people, keeping a functional private school on the grounds open to local youths run by the Sisters of St. Felix, and has even been known to open the doors of his estate to the public for equestrian events and fox hunting trips, and to those in need during times of strife, such as using the mansion to harbor refugees during the Second Civil War. With modern castles such as these, perhaps America can reach or even surpass the cultural grandiosity of the Old World as we endeavor to make our Union the hegemon of the West."

There, they agreed to help Virginia’s sister by adopting her two children named Lydie and George, sending them to good schools as Marland worked to make his millions for the second time. After a decade of living in Oklahoma, Virginia would die of pneumonia, leaving Marland a widower, but not for long. Two years later, he had his adoption of Lydie annulled, and married her shortly after, despite her being 28 while he was 54, and despite him raising her as his adopted daughter since she was 16. \n\nThough arrangements like this are not uncommon, their relationship has still managed to be quite the scandal, similar to the scandal former President Grover Cleveland went through decades ago. To keep from the public eye and away from the controversy, Lydie frequently stays at home in Marland’s extravagant Ponca City mansion, only appearing at the most important state functions, while Marland himself largely keeps quiet on the matter, redirecting the conversation to more important matters whenever he is able."

Flailing during the Great Panic of 1907, again during the 1910s as predatory monopolies ripped his business apart, and even again during the Great Depression, Marland has had some poor luck, but has always won back his fortune each time, with it growing larger with each resurgence. \n\nDespite this, the monopolists like Rockefeller and Morgan ridicule our President ceaselessly along with their paid allies in Congress, but all that shall soon end. With the newest bills being passed, the power, influence, and fortunes of these coastal elites will soon wither as Marland’s once did, but there's will not rebound, for the new Democratic Party will truly make America a land of opportunity for all, and not just these elitist bigwigs that have dominated and ruined this great nation for far too long."

unionstate.30003.d:0 "Though Huey Long was a titanic figure and beloved by millions, this hero of the everyman no longer runs the show, for now is the age of Marland. With the Kingfish gone, Marland has moved to ‘de-Longify’ the Union State and its political apparatus, moving the nation back towards true democracy free of the charismatic and populist strongman that gave birth to this new America. In order to replace the near cult of personality that arose around the Kingfish, Marland and his Democrats have begun to position our new President as the new champion of the Common Man. With our egalitarian Capitalist policies, the Little New Deal, and with Marland’s own fortune and charisma, this slick oilman will hopefully become the new beloved face of this reforged Union, replacing but never forgetting the founder Huey Long as we strive to make America prosperous and equal once more."

unionstate.30004.d:0 "As we move to rebrand and reform the Democratic Party under the direction of President E.W. Marland in this restored Union, our coalition of diverse Liberals must decide a solid direction, for we must cleanse the bad name given to us by splinters like the ODP. Between us are two main camps vying for control over the fate of this new Center-Left front for America, because although we largely agree on economics and other concerns, our social tastes differ wildly. The so-called Pioneer Liberals, largely made up of politicians from the heartland of the Union’s territory, are the more progressive group of the pair, championing Liberal ideas of Civil Rights and social reform. Their main opponents are nicknamed as the ‘Coastal’ Liberals - a name said with hate by the Pioneers who view them as puppets of the Pacific States - and are far more conservative in their social views, championing good labor and worker relations like their rivals but resisting total racial and socioeconomic equality. Whoever shall win out will help guide President Marland on his path to rebuild this new Union, but only one can win. Who shall it be?"
unionstate.30004.a:0 "The progressive ‘Pioneer’ Liberals win out."

### Pendergast Events ###

unionstate.1402.t:0 "Pendergast Discredits Long!"
unionstate.1402.d:0 "Infamous Democratic ‘Boss’ T. J. Pendergast is known as the King of Kansas City, and for good reason. Within his grubby palms lies most of Missouri, along with the surrounding metropolises such as Wichita and Omaha, and this corrupt Democrat empire still continues to grow. Using his political machine, his open ties to gambling, his open alliances with criminal groups, and his massive network of shady allies and elite friends, Pendergast has grown to be one of the most influential politicians in the Union State, even if he currently strays away from national politics. \n\nIn the past, Pendergast has made demands to the Kingfish to allow his own corrupt fiefdom to continue to operate, offering his support to Long if he would just stay out of Pendergast’s business, but each time, the Kingfish has basically just told him to get lost. However, Pendergast still sends his delegates and cronies to sway our opinion, and has done so yet again. Such an alliance could easily improve Long’s position in the Union State, and would make integrating certain areas of the wider Union easier should we win this brother war. However, indebting ourselves to such an openly corrupt and criminal force might harm Long’s gold-plated reputation among his loyal followers. What should we do?"
unionstate.1402.a:0 "Backtrack and make an alliance with Pendergast."
unionstate.1402.b:0 "Pender-who?"

unionstate.1403.t:0 "Pendergast Harasses Our Supporters in Kansas City"
unionstate.1403.d:0 "Furious over the Kingfish’s denial of his support once again, Pendergast and his cronies have begun to harass Longists all across Kansas City and wider Missouri and his surrounding centers of influence. Intimidating our loyalists on the streets or at the polls, vandalizing their property, sending threats in the mail and more, Pendergast’s goons are hellbent on making the life of every Longist a living hell so long as they stay in Pendergast’s fiefdom. Should we step in and defend our loyalists, or do we think they can handle themselves? They *are* only going up against a bunch of corrupt bums and sycophants; how hard could it be?"
unionstate.1403.a:0 "Start Investigating the Pendergast Machine!"
unionstate.1403.b:0 "They can handle themselves."

unionstate.1404.t:0 "Rumors of Pendergast’s Influence in the Government"
unionstate.1404.d:0 "It would seem that Pendergast’s hunger for power has not subsided, for now after he already eradicated the Longist presence from his area, he now guns for the national government controlled by Huey Long. Rumors have begun to swirl that Pendergast and his agents and goons have begun to infiltrate the Union State’s government, seeking to topple the Longist regime once and for all from the inside. Surely these are just baseless rumors though, for how could such a little fish topple the Kingfish in his own pond? Regardless, maybe we should keep our eye on this, or should we just focus on the true threat at hand - this violent and bloody brother war seeking to tear America apart?"
unionstate.1404.a:0 "Start an Investigation into the accused!"
unionstate.1404.b:0 "Merely hearsay!"

unionstate.1405.t:0 "Pendergast Dethrones Long!"
unionstate.1405.d:0 "The Kingfish has fallen, but the King of Kansas City now rises. Subjugating the Longist machine beneath his own and toppling Long’s foul populist government, the stench of Leftism has been eradicated from the Union State, all thanks to T. J. Pendergast and his loyal cronies. Now corruption and white-collar crime shall become the name of the game here in the Union State, for Boss Tom and his endless legion of paid-off loyalists are ready to bring the perfected form of Democrat-led Republicanism to America - that is, Democracy built on the backs of bribes and graft, and all within the palm of our own King Midas Tom Pendergast."
unionstate.1405.a:0 "Down with the Kingfish! All hail the new king!"

unionstate.14050.t:0 "The Senator from Pendergast"
unionstate.14050.d:0 "Pendergast is a very dirty politician. So dirty in fact that every politician associated with him has not lasted long before some scandal or another had to be squashed by Tom’s machine. Considering the fact that all politicians of any note in the entire nation are in some way connected to Pendergast, that means that there is little if any honesty left in politics. That is however, save for one. A new man has begun to emerge on the political scene, a Senator named Harry Truman. Having managed to escape the Civil War and Pendergast's rise and consolidation with little if any tomfoolery dirtying his squeaky clean image, Harry appears to the public as the last honest man in America. What the public doesn't know is that Harry Truman is attached to Pendergast like an 11th finger. As the people grow rowdy bowing to crooks, Pendergast finally has some use for the boy scout. He has decided to prop Truman up as the official Opposition. Harry can rant and rave and steam about how corrupt the system is all he wants and ride the wave of popular support as high as he can get it. Meanwhile Pendergast knows just who to pay and how much to pay them to keep Truman on side. A symbiotic relationship if there ever was one."
unionstate.14050.a:0 "An offer he won't refuse"

unionstate.14080.t:0 "A Successful Investigation into the Pendergast Machine"
unionstate.14080.d:0 "As we have moved to investigate Boss Tom Pendergast, we initially struggled to find a charge or crime that could stick on this greasy fat cat. Dodging previous charges such as his ties to the clearly-rigged election of Golden Delicious apple mogul and heir to a massive agricultural fortune Lloyd C. Stark, instigating electoral violence over shootings and beatings at the polls, his clear ties to Kansas City mob boss Charles Vincent ‘Charlie the Wop’ Carrollo, and more, we have finally found a charge that can stick. \n\nNabbing this sickly sack of crap on income tax evasion charges, Pendergast is now on a one-way ticket to the big house; a double gut-punch to Boss Tom after his recent diagnosis of colon cancer. With news of his arrest hitting headlines across the Union, Pendergast’s allies and cronies have begun to jump ship en-masse in an attempt to not get dragged down by the sinking ship that is the Pendergast Machine, with even his own wife publicly filing for divorce. The King of Kansas City has been reduced to a sniveling whelp as the Kingfish and his loyal allies finally deliver true justice, leaving the power-vacuum in Missouri to be filled by loyal Longists in the wake, spelling out a final end to Boss Tom’s criminal empire."
unionstate.14080.a:0 "The Tax Man always gets its cut."

unionstate.1406.t:0 "Greasing the Wheels"
unionstate.1406.d:0 "Pendergast has no real use for Mexicans. It's not that he hates them, it's just there weren’t so many in Kansas City that he had to actually look after them. Now however Pendergast has a lot more Mexicans under his jurisdiction. Already the Mexican vote has begun to gradually shift to his camp, but that shift is not fast enough for Pendergast. He worries that some upstart naysayer can come in and promise them the world and lock down their vote for the next few centuries. That is why he has begun to cook up a new political program aimed specifically at the Mexican vote. Promising an easy path to immigration, job placement programs and through social outreach managed by the Guadalupe Center under Dorothy Gallagher means it looks mighty attractive to the average Mexican immigrant. However, doing so would undoubtedly alienate the not insignificant white racist vote. Pendergast must choose, the South-West or the South?"
unionstate.1406.a:0 "Bread and Circuses!"
unionstate.1406.b:0 "Immediate Deportation!"

unionstate.1407.t:0 "The Ignored Minority"
unionstate.1407.d:0 "Memphis is a machine all on its own and remains largely outside of Pendergast’s direct control. The man at its controls, E.H. Crump is a lot like Pendergast. Both are Democrats and both are populists and most importantly, both are as corrupt as any political boss. Crump’s hold on Memphis is maintained through an unlikely alliance with the Black vote. Crump has done much to support the Black community in the city through patronage of its leaders and giving the blacks a right to vote at all. Pendergast has begun to use Crump to expand such measures to other cities across the South like Birmingham and Atlanta. We can copy the Crump system in major cities across the Black Belt like Atlanta and Birmingham to finally bring the ever reluctant black vote into line. We will however have to keep them at arm's length so we don’t anger the Southern Whites. It will be an extremely delicate, extremely precarious balancing act but if we keep the plates spinning, everybody gets to go home to dinner."
unionstate.1407.a:0 "An unlikely southern brand of progress."

unionstate.1408.t:0 "The Rabbit and the Goat"
unionstate.1408.d:0 "Pendergast’s long term ally and oftentimes rival James Shannon is another political machine boss of Missouri. Frequently butting heads over who should be more dominant, and split between ideas of faux-Liberalism and staunch Conservatism, this divide has often caused a rift in our cabinet as they constantly try to pull one over on the other, but this back-and-forth ‘friendly’ competition is finally at its end. Shannon’s faction, nicknamed the Rabbits, has finally begun to falter before the Goat faction of Pendergast as he brings all of the Union State under his control and within his grubby palms. Each day, more and more of Shannon’s own cronies pledge their full support for Pendergast over all, knowing Boss Tom to be the only man who can truly care for them as he greases the wheels of national politics with graft and corruption. As his chance at dominance wanes, Shannon and his Rabbits have finally begun to tow the main Party line, further solidifying all power within Pendergast’s palms."
unionstate.1408.a:0 "The Goat trumps the Rabbit every time."

unionstate.1409.d:0 "With the Union State secured and the American people finally healing, the great efforts of Pendergast’s political machine has finally begun to pay off bigtime. Graft and corruption flows through every avenue and vein of this new Union, pumped by the black heart in Kansas City. The Democratic Party has evolved into a fusion of criminal Liberalism, and our economy, along with the fat wallet of Pendergast, has only grown and improved. However, with our power now reaching its zenith, we are free to decide just how to define ourselves in this new political landscape. How should we go forward in this new America under the Pendergast Stamp?"
unionstate.1409.a:0 "Move to perfect our Kleptocracy under Boss Pendergast!"

unionstate.30005.t:0 "An Unexpected Arrival from an Old Friend"
unionstate.30005.d:0 "Today, the people of New York City, in the wee hours of the morning, awoke to a fairly normal day. As laborers set out for the factories and the NYPD begin their daily patrols, the new normal of civic life was suddenly interrupted, as the flow of traffic across the Hudson was suddenly stopped. This was of course immediate investigated by the NYPD whom found the cause of the blockage quite suddenly. For sat across the river was an entire army, arrayed for battle. This was no conquering army, come to claim the Big Apple for one of the many factions in the quagmire that is the civil war. No, this army has come to the City That Never Sleeps to seek safe harbor from the vortex of conflict that is the Civil War. Under the leadership of Philip Acosta Carroll, this army, a Papal Militia send by the Pope himself to aid the efforts of Huey Long and the Union, is one of the few remnants of the Union State to fight on, and the only one on the east coast. Having fought their way from Baltimore, this militia of Catholics seeks to use their leader's connections to the Christian Front to gain refuge from the slaughter of the war. Prior to the War, Philip Carroll, as lawyer, defended the Front in many high profile cases, even personally defending Bishop Molloy as he was tried for hate crimes. Due to these connections, and Carroll's own promises to the men under his watch, Carroll hopes that the Christian Front shall grant them asylum.\n\nWhile such a request would normally be granted quite quickly, as Carroll was a valuable asset and the Front, if nothing, is good to it's own. What is hampering this, is the train of Catholics that are following the Militia in toe. Following the fall of the Union State and the exodus of the Papal militia, various prominent Catholics, among them such people as Father Fulton Sheen, Dorothy Day, Al Smith and Supreme Knight Martin Carmondy, joined the Militia on their march north, hoping to find a true home for American Catholicism. Due to the shear size of the group, numbered to be almost 5,000, with at least 10,000 civilians in their train, and the radical beliefs of some of those within the civilian train, the difficulty of what to do with them has arisen.\n\nMany of those within the Protestant side of the Front believe that we should simply deny their request, and let them wonder off, as we already have far to many Catholics in this city, and allowing such a large group might tip the scales in the favor of the Catholics. Should we simply let them go, it is likely they will continue their search for a home, carving their way through their enemies to do so.  While many within the Catholic side of the Front think that we should grant them their request, after all, they fought for the Church and the sole government that could have brought true social justice to America, and deserve a place to call home. Bishop Molloy and his loyalists, always the moderates, have suggested a middle ground. In short, the Bishop would have the militia and their civilian train granted asylum, they would need to work for the privilege. The militia itself would be grafted onto the NYPD as an official unit and would be tasked with the maintenance of public order in Flushing, Queens and their command staff, along with qualified civilians would be joined to our own officer corp. As for the civilians, they would be tasked with the upkeep and transformation of Flushing into a model of Catholic and Protestant cooperation. His Grace also seemed to favor the creation of an autonomy for Flushing, to allow the militia a free hand in transforming the local. Either way, with an army at the gates, we must come to a decision, least they choose to make New York their home by force."

unionstate.30006.t:0 "The ‘Khaki-Shirts’ Pledge Support for the Kingfish"
unionstate.30006.d:0 "We have received a delegation from the curious Arthur J. Smith, self-proclaimed leader of the so called 'Khaki-shirts'. Formerly known in newspapers for his exploits as a worldly ‘soldier of fortune’, Smith had created his own khaki clad paramilitary after breaking ties with his former comrade, Walter W. Waters, who had offered his services to the Combined Syndicates. Art claims he and his men have fought through Syndicalist occupied Philadelphia to our provisional capital in New Orleans, raiding national guard depots and fighting off syndicalist militias along the way. Arranging a meeting with our very own Gerald L. K. Smith, the khaki chief praised the ‘manocratic’ macho of the Kingfish, and promised to mobilize his khaki legionnaires if provided with proper funds and equipment. With this proposition being relayed back to President Long, the final decision rests at the hands of the Kingfish."

unionstate.30007.t:0 "The Glory Only His Eyes Can See"
unionstate.30007.d:0 "When not guiding our pious Commonwealth towards the holy glory of direct democracy free from congressional tyranny and syndicalist terror with the aid of our charity state safeguarded from radicalism by God under the guidance of the Christian Party, President William Dudley Pelley is known to dabble in his own little outlandish world. Sure, many of his public speeches and sermons are quite normal, God-fearing affairs, but many of Pelley’s close associates and true friends - or enemies - know a different truth. Claiming that he was blessed with a ‘hypno-dimensional’ experience by God and Jesus themselves that showed him the true nature of the universe and its different planes of existence, Pelley has taken to mixing aspects of Theosophy, Spiritualism, Spiritism, Rosicrucianism, Pyramidism, Right Roerichism, and more into his growing, all-encompassing spiritual theo-philosophy, with the sane administration around him and his loyalist zealots struggling to keep it all under wraps, or at least under control so that this ‘soulcraft’ doesn’t metastasize and spread nationwide. When not raving about the Judeo-Syndicalist global plot or other ‘Dark Souls’ - what he calls African-Americans, Jews, Communists and other forces of so-called evil - behind closed doors, then he his spouting off about his recent delve into UFOlogy or his self-proclaimed expertise at metaphysics and astral projection, being the first in any room to suggest if he can show off his ability to levitate or phase through walls - or so he and his followers say. Spreading these ideas without hesitation to his Silver Legion, the paramilitary at his beck and call have begun to evolve into their own esoteric Chrisitan militia dedicated both to the peaceful, humanitarian doctrine of the Christian Party and the conspiracies and occultist beliefs of their patriarch. Should Pelley and his fanatics be allowed to continue their spread of these outlandish ideas, or shall we all open our eyes to the glory of the coming of Pelley’s epigenetic lord?"
unionstate.30007.a:0 "Keep a lid on the President’s more outlandish beliefs."

unionstate.30008.t:0 "The Future of the Christian Party Platform"
unionstate.30008.d:0 "Long viewing Congress as a hotbed for debauchery, corruption, stagnation, and sin, President Pelley and his Christian Party have moved on their plans to defang and shackle this dying and failed legislative body until it has been fully strangled and withered for the good of American democracy. However, with unrest, racial tensions, and radical violence still rampant across the still-healing lands of the old Union, many close to Pelley - especially Pelley’s right-hand man Henry Allen and the more extreme guardians of Christian civilization within the Silver Legion - have suggested that we use this opportunity to fully shackle not just Congress but the entire democratic apparatus of the Commonwealth as a whole along with it in order to complete our heaven-ordained task of turning America into God’s paradise on Earth. \n\nWith Allen and the Silver Legion pushing for the complete corruption of our electoral process in order to ensure our everlasting success and unmatched dominance, willing to use even violent means to achieve them, while the moderate majority of the Christian Party supports the ideas of unabated democratic freedom while resisting Pelley’s rabid paramilitary, a choice must now be made. Should we continue along the path of Pelley’s original plan for a of near-utopian nature under God by keeping his ideas of an unfettered and wholly Christian direct democracy, or should we begin to undermine some of our good-faith principles and so-called dedication to American liberties in order to ensure that Pelley’s Commonwealth follows the will of our presidential prophet regardless of the obsequious, sheepish masses?"

unionstate.30009.t:0 "The Absaroka Question"
unionstate.30009.d:0 "As we deal with the great mess the Second American Civil War has made during this second era of Reconstruction, an old idea has been brought back to life - the Absaroka state proposal. Headed by local street commissioner turned politician and militia leader A. R. Swickard, the Absaroka movement called for the creation of a new federal state using lands from southern Montana, northern Wyoming, and western South Dakota in response to feeling forgotten about by the Federal Government in Washington as the radicalism that preceded the Second American Civil War swept the Great Plains, leading many families and communities to ruin without so much as a call from the White House. During the Civil War, Swickard and his militias even contemplated complete secession from America in totality as their movement found themselves on opposite sides of the Unionist-Federalist border, but Huey Long was able to wrangle them into his big tent coalition using his guile and charisma, keeping the Absarokans invested in the American Dream and fully on his side. Since then Swickard and his Absarokans have been model loyalists to the Kingfish’s cause, and now that the guns have finally fallen silent perhaps it may be time to reward such loyalty. \n\nMost Absarokans including Swickard himself have suggested that, as a way reward their loyalty while simultaneously punishing the traitor states of Montana and Wyoming that partially sided with the Federalist government, we could carve up their lands in order to create a compromised Absarokan administrative entity within our Unionist system, while some radical holdouts in the movement still cry for their promised lands in South Dakota - though this has put strain on Longist allies on the South Dakota Sioux reservations like senator Ben Reifel from Rosebud, leading to further resistance within our administration to the plan. Should we allow some form of the Absarokan dream to come to fruition, or should we tell these old allies to get lost?"

#AUS's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

POLITICS_GEORGE_VAN_HORN_MOSELEY:0 "Fourty years of service for the United States Army from a cavalry lieutenant in the Philippines to a Commissioned Officer in Washington has created a strong portfolio for Moseley. Experiences serving alongside generals like George Patton and General MacArthur influenced his eventual decision to support Huey Long and his adamant belief in Jewish conspiracy. Ultimately his belief in the dangers of any form of socialism made him the perfect spokesman of the War Powers Committee. Without Moseley would be impossible for the War Powers Committee to succeed Huey Long in the disappearance that Moseley was complicit in, so say the rumors."
POLITICS_WILLIAM_DUDLEY_PELLEY:0 "At age thirty-nine William Pelley was a rather unimaginative Hollywood screenwriter and journalist. His past adventures mostly consisting of visiting Russia and absorbing anti-Semitic pamphlets. By the time of his founding the Silver Legion in 1933, Pelley had cultivated his unique ideology, combining spiritualism, democracy, and faith. With Pelley's more eccentric views being reserved for trusted allies only. After his organisation was allowed to participate in elections by Huey Long, he went on to win the elections with his “Christian Party”. Anti-socialism and a belief in Christian Identity and Expanded Democracy are the ideals that forms the backbone of his government."
POLITICS_PAPPY_O_DANIEL_DESC:0 "Wilbert Lee O'Daniel has had a fascinating journey. Beginning his adult life as a flour salesman, he also branched out into music and radio, eventually taking over his company's radio advertising effort and making it into his own project. It was in this radio show that the "pass the biscuits, Pappy" phrase was first used, and it was also where O'Daniel would become a household name. During the recent turmoil in Texas and the rest of the country, O'Daniel decided to throw his lot in with Huey Long and the America First Party, believing them to be better representatives of the common people than the federal government, despite many disagreements on policy grounds. Now, having begun his own political adventure as the leader of the Democrats in Texas and the Union State as a whole, he hopes to lead America through the current crisis with nothing but old-fashioned Texas values and his Christian faith to guide him."
POLITICS_GERALD_L_K_SMITH:0 "For decades thought to be a follower more than a leader, Gerald Smith has come onto his own after joining the Huey Long’s American Union State in 1937 while on the evangelical circuit. An ordained Minister in his early life, Smith first came under the influence of Huey Long's Share Our Wealth society. Smith however migrated to the far-right portion of the AFP. Smith had continued to serve under Long, and despite their numerous disputes, he has managed to secure his position as Huey Long’s Successor. Now that he is in charge, there is little doubt that the AFP will migrate further right."
POLITICS_EARL_KEMP_LONG:0 "Once denied the Lieutenant Governor's post by his brother Huey Long in 1932, Earl Long has long lived in his brother's shadow. Earl was known in Congress for his progressive policies, but also for supporting the AFP's authority over state government. As the pre-determined successor to Huey Long years before his death, Earl displays the same reformist agenda, but with a more socially conservative and indulgent touch. It is under Earl Long that Huey Long's eduction and welfare reforms were really put into practice during those tense years. Whispers of Earl's racist remarks and of mental instability are covered up by the AFP."


POLITICS_CHAD_KOC_KING_DESC:0 "Martin Henry Carmody, born in 1872, has been a faithful Catholic his entire life. Joining the Knights of Columbus at a young age he quickly became invested in its history as well as the faithful knightley servants of christendom, thus when he became its head knight in 1929, he started focusing on the study of history and recollections of old. When Phillip Carroll took power, Carmody quickly started trying to earn his support, which he did when Carroll selected the knights to be his own personal bodyguard. This new assignment seemed to have changed Carmody as he took it seriously, turning the knights assigned to his protection into a true protection detail as well as selecting recruits off total loyalty and honour. Soon this almost identical to old knight order had its part to play when after the sad passing of Carroll, the knights were a keen influential role in the hardliner faction. With his crowning as Martin I, King of America, it seems the task of bringing Fudealism to America has been completed. Despite this, the ever watching Knights appear to be growing even stronger, all to protect America's newfound status as the final bastion of Christendom."

POLITICS_ROBERT_STUART:0 "As the rightful claimant to the Stuart line, it was only natural for the now deceased James III’s throne to pass to the most-legitimate heir. Our new King has been crowned, and now Rupprecht Maria Luitpold Ferdinand, King of Bavaria, Duke of Bavaria, Franconia and in Swabia, Count Palatine by the Rhein, by the Grace of God, stands as the new King of America, King of England, King of Scotland, Emperor of the New British Empire, and Defender of the Faith. This aging and experienced king, born in Munich in 1869, has lived a storied life as a veteran soldier and as a career aristocrat - a fitting background for such noble and honored king. With his ascension, the true line of the Stuarts once more has been returned its birthright."

POLITICS_MARY_STUART:0 "With the sudden death of her father, the young María del Rosario Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, 18th Duchess of Alba, by the Grace of God, has been coronated as Queen of America, Queen of England, Queen of Scotland, Empress of the New British Empire, and Defender of the Faith. Born in 1926 to the late King Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart and his deceased wife, the Doña María del Rosario de Silva y Gurtubay, Duchess of Alba de Tormes, 9th Marquise of San Vicente del Barco, Grandee of Spain, Queen María is by birthright the true heir of the Stuart line - a true descendant of the honored James II and a Stuart by blood. This purple-blooded royal, however, is but a inexperienced young socialite, and still woefully inexperienced in the art of statecraft, but with the aid of her trusted advisors, the Holy American League, and the honored Archregent Carroll, this young Queen may be just the darling America needs to bring popular support to our young monarchy. May she be the central rallying figure of our fractured people while we seek to rebuild our nation as America crowns its first Queen."

POLITICS_STUART_REGENCY:0 "With the King dead and his daughter María currently too young to take the throne, a regency council has been set up by Regent Carroll and the Holy American League. Under this new system, the Regent effectively rules the nation as a benevolent dictator in the stead of the young Princess María, though this reality of who is in control is barely hidden. Through a thin, minimally maintained facade, Regent Carroll controls every aspect of the American government, pulling the strings of this pious and blessed Empire to pursue his own ends - and  all from behind the shadow of a young girl. Until the time María is old enough to take the throne, this Holy Empire shall be run from the not-too-dark shadows of Carroll’s regency, though many within the nation feel as though this day shall never truly come, and that the Regent plans to solidify power fully for himself, though Carroll himself has tried to put these fears to rest as best he can. Regardless of his intent, the Regent’s word is final, and his decrees might as well be divine providence, for the Regent and his regency now rule America without obstacle."

POLITICS_CARROLL_STUART_REGENT_DESC:0 "While the Monarch is nominally the head of state of America, it is clear to all where the true power of government is held. Philip Acosta Carroll, war hero and head of the Holy American League, is the true linchpin of power in America. Appointed Regent (the direct successor to the former office of President) by James III as his first official act, Regent Carroll has sworn he will do anything and stop at nothing to correct the course of America, for the better."

POLITICS_CHRIST_THE_KING_DESC:0 "Following one of the most controversial political decisions in modern history, Jesus of Nazareth has officially been crowned as King of America. This title means very little in actual practice. After all, to truly exercise His authority as King of America would require the literal Second Coming, an event that will bring about the very end of politics. In reality, Christ's Kingship over America is little more then a thinly veiled attempt by the Holy American League to justify their Political Catholicism and Authoritarianism. If Christ's Kingship turns out to be little more then cover for a horrid dictatorship or the beginning of a truly brighter future for America remains to be seen."


POLITICS_HOLY_AMERCIA_DESC:0 "The Holy American Regency Council was birthed in the chaos of St Mary’s city. As the very congress held to decide who would succeed our beloved Carroll soon devolved into a crowd throwing shoes at one another, there were a few who saw the potential danger this possessed. So as their predictions turned true and the city devolved into infighting between power hungry factions, These truly blessed congressmen formed together and decided that only in unity may the nation survive. Now these congressmen lead the nation together in a council that decides the fate of the nation, and as long as they stand they shall not allow chaos on America’s door ever again."

POLITICS_REGENT_JOE_DESC:0 "Joseph P Kennedy Jr was born July 25th 1915. Born to the rising Kennedy family, his father groomed him to be a future politician, The first Roman catholic President. However duty calls, and when America broke out in a violent civil war he signed up for service with Catholic troops in the Union state rather than stay in the relatively calm New England. This proved to be a good decision as the catholics would soon pave the way to being the rulers of america, with Kennedy having made a name for himself. Serving evermore with the military, he would have simply continued on had it not been for the political chaos in St Mary’s City. Not allowing Political ambitions to result in the collapse of this Catholic state, Kennedy led the military units outside to capture the capitol and restore order. And never again will corrupt politicians and their bands of followers threaten order."

POLITICS_CHAD_KOC_DESC:0 "Martin Henry Carmody, born in 1872, has been a faithful Catholic his entire life. Joining the Knights of Columbus at a young age he quickly became invested in its history as well as the faithful knightley servants of christendom, thus when he became its head knight in 1929, he started focusing on the study of history and recollections of old. When Phillip Carroll took power, Carmody quickly started trying to earn his support, which he did when Carroll selected the knights to be his own personal bodyguard. This new assignment seemed to have changed Carmody as he took it seriously, turning the knights assigned to his protection into a true protection detail as well as selecting recruits off total loyalty and honour. Soon this almost identical to old knight order had its part to play when after the sad passing of Carroll, the knights were a keen influential role in the hardliner faction. Now with the Knights having won the power struggle, they seem to be dead set on their goals of a truly nostalgic return to God’s Christendom."

POLITICS_FEENEY_DESC:0 "Leonard Feeney, Born Feb 18, 1897 has always been a strict jesuit, believing that anything other than an exact interpretation of the catholic doctrine was a gateway to hell. With his belief in strict catholic ideals and distrust towards non catholics, Phillip Carroll saw fit in putting him to the position of Leader of the American Inquisition. With this new found power Feeney immediately got to work in putting down partisan groups that opposed the new catholic order, and helping put an inquisitorial watch over the “baptization of America”. He always made sure inquisition had a watch on the newly christened catholics of america as he was sure some were hidden wolves in the sheep herd, and then with the passing of Carroll, he voiced these concerns more than ever. Now with the trust of the Congress granting him power over the nation, Feeney and the Inquisition will end these dangers as they have all the power, with none to oppose them."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_CHARLES_DESC:0 "Charles Coughlin was born on october 25th, 1891. He has become a very notorious father within America as he has been a very charismatic speaker with his utilization of radio broadcasts for both catholic messages as well as some more heated controversial topics involving his views on the economy and minorities. His views towards helping American families eventually brought him into tow with the America First party under Huey long. While he considered himself a proud member of the party and it’s ideals, he was first a catholic, And thus he tipped his hat in with Phillip Carroll’s league after the success of the gunpowder plot. Now years later he has proven himself worthy in the eyes of the league, nominating him as leader of the nation. Perhaps this fire-spoken father is what our nation needs."


POLITICS_FULTON_SHEEN_DESC:0 "Fulton John Sheen, Born in May 1895. Fulton made a name for himself with his teachings and being a well spoken preacher on the radio to catholic America. Although not as well known as Coughlin, this humble bishop had served as a servant to Catholics all across America with his teachings at the Catholic university and representation of them. This service and representation put him into the sight of Carroll who assigned him to his cabinet and had him continue to be the loyal preacher to the rapidly changing America. Now with the passing of Christ's regent Fulton Sheen has once again proven himself worthy in the eyes of the Holy American League who put their faith in him as Carroll’s successor. Sheen now has a lot of decisions on his plate, however keeping the spirit of Carroll’s America is his main goal, for blessed are the pure of heart."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_SMITH_DESC:0 "Many politicians profess a desire for reform or pretend to crusade against corruption in all forms, but only a select few politicians both hold true to these promises while also becoming successful, efficient, and prominent while doing so. Archregent Al Smith is one such politician - a rare unsullied gem amid a sea of wolves and schemers. Born in 1873 in Manhattan to a working class Catholic Irish immigrants, Smith got a start into politics young by falling in with ‘Silent’ Charlie Murphy and the Tammany Hall group. It was in these young years that Smith solidified his reformist ideals and love for the working man - a foundation that would fuel his explosive career to new heights. Long dominating New York’s political stage as a member of the infamous Tammany Hall political machine that helped his rise and later as a leader the successful Efficiency Movement aimed at reforming the legislation that was leading his state to decay, Smith had become as famous nationwide for being one of the only successful Catholic politicians has he had been for his unending slew of successful legislation. Now, as Archregent, Smith has cast off the doubters who once whispered that the Pope would dictate his every whim, for no being or mantra guides Smith in his policy other than his dual faiths in good, honest governance and the Lord."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_DAY_DESC:0 "Few have been able to balance a deep sense of socialist justice while still holding true to pure Christian principles as well as now-Archregent Dorothy Day. Born into a middle class Anglo-Irish family in Brooklyn in 1897, Day’s own religious awakening was brought on by her own reading, practice, and study; her parents being nominal Christians at best, driving Day to find God in her own way. After this Christianity-fueled interest consumed her childhood, Day spent her adolescence living the Bohemian dream, traveling across the nation as a journalist and vagabond, picking up new influences and ideas as she bounced from one Christian sect and Socialist ideology to another in her quest to find herself. After over a decade of soul-searching, as well as dealing with the trials of new motherhood, the American Civil War, and balancing her loyalties to her Socialist contacts in the IWW and her episcopal contacts in the former-Union State, Day has grown into one of the most unique and tempered political leaders in the Holy American League. Though many still distrust her Socialist sympathies, all true believers know Day’s love of Socialism comes not from a love of dusty, dated theory, but from seeing it as the loving, egalitarian will of the Lord himself. She shall be the prophet that shows America the light of true, non-bastardized Socialism - a Socialism bathed in God’s glory and tempered through piety."

POLITICS_JACOBO_F_J_STUART:0 "Born the 17th of October 1878, Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba, now James III of America, has achieved a position he never even dreamed he would have. Before he assumed the long vacant throne of America, Jacobo had lived a fairly exciting life. He had been the Foreign Minister of Spain until 1931, an art collector and even an Olympic Medalist, wining a silver medal in polo at the 1924 Olympic Games in Berlin. On 7 October 1920 he married Maria del Rosario de Silva, 9th Marchioness of San Vicente del Barco. The two of them have had one daughter, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, Jacobo's heir-apparent.\nWhen Jacobo first received the letter inviting him to assume the throne of America, he was shocked. While he was the senior Jacobite claimant, he had never pushed the claim and he never expected to the claim to come into play, let alone in a breakoff colony that had been burning with the fires of Republicanism and anti-Catholicism since it's foundation. Yet here he is, King over a nation none ever thought would have a king again.\nAlthough he has been crowned, Jacobo has little to no power, as he was 'encouraged' by the same man who gave him the crown to give power over to him. Although Jacobo is clearly just a powerless figurehead, he has taken to his new role excellently, appearing in public almost everyday, be it giving speeches, appearing along side Regent Carroll or simply going for a walk with his family. While he may be a glorified rubber stamp for the Holy American League, Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart clearly loves his people, and they love him in return."

POLITICS_E_W_MARLAND:0 "Born in Pittsburgh in 1874 into a businessman’s family, Ernest Whitworth Marland has long journeyed along the path of American Capitalism, but despite many of his contemporaries, this love of profit and cash did not forge him into an enemy of the working man. Son of a mill owner who boasted that he never had to deal with a strike in his long career due to truly taking care of his own workers, Marland grew up embracing capitalism while also understanding the need for good labor relations. Educated in private schools on an accelerated schedule until entering law school, Marland graduated at the young age of 19 with a full law degree, and took it upon himself to establish his own fortune before settling down. Becoming interested in geology during his time as an attorney, Marland eventually swapped to the oil business, hoping to make it big during Pennsylvania’s big oil boom, and setting him on the path to be an oilman for life. Founding numerous different ventures and businesses, Marland made his fortune many times over, losing it each time to downturns like the great Panic of 1907 or due to predatory monopolies seeking to buy him out. Eventually finding more stable success, Marland would go on to run for Congress, taking a seat in the House of Representatives as he represented Oklahoma’s 8th district, being the first Democrat to hold the position in over 15 years. Growing popular due to his unique form of humane capitalism and due to his reputation as a friend of the common working man, Marland would ride the wave of popularity to be Oklahoma’s governor in 1935 after displacing old Alfalfa Bill Murray himself due to Murray stepping back to run as President, but fate would cut this term short. As the fires of the American Civil War sparked to life, Marland would find himself shoved to the sidelines in the Union State by the Kingfish and his cronies as he fought for influence in Oklahoma against the rising tide of the ODP, but with Long gone and with the ACW finally coming to a close, perhaps it's finally time for Marland and his unique vision for a progressive capitalist frontiersman America to come to fruition."

His grandfater, Colonel Carlos Alvarez de la Mesa, was a Spanish immigrant who fought for the Union in the Civil War. His father, Colonel Samuel Allen, also served in the military. In 1907, Allen was appointed to West Point in New York. Eventually, this would end in failure primarily due to a stutter, and Allen was kicked out of the school. However, after a successful education at the Catholic University of America, he got a second chance at a military career, and become a second lieutenant of the U.S. Cavalry assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia. Over the years, he has slowly climbed the ranks, and a freak accident that saw him shot in the jaw caused his stutter to disappear. While moving up the chain of command, Allen continued his military education at various institutions, from the U.S. Army Cavalry School and U.S. Army Command School, both in Kansas, to the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He would continue his career as an instructor and eventually met George C. Marshall Jr., who promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. Though he skipped the rank of Colonel that his familial predecessors had had, he did not mind, his focus being on the battlefield first and foremost. In fact, many have compared him to General George S. Patton in his approach to warfare, as his aggressive style and colorful style make him very similar to the more famous man. However, the two differ outside of those factors, as Allen cares little for his appearance and more for tactics, emphasizing night assaults and unpredictable plans. His confident, efficient style of leadership has given him one of the most promising careers in the U.S. Army. Or it did, until 1936, when Major General Omar Bradley clashed with Allen and caused Allen to flee west to the familiar state of Texas, where he had met his wife and served some of his first years of military service.

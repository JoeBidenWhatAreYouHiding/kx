### Parties ###
TEX_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America -  The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party of America"
TEX_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - The SPA operating in our territory is loyal to the IWW in the CSA, and our relations with them are largely dictated by our relations with them. Nonetheless, machine politics, propaganda and the use of populism to absorb many of their potential voters has left them without a chance of being elected in our region."
TEX_radical_socialist_party:0 "Independent League"
TEX_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Independent League - An association aligned with the Social Patriots in the CSA, these radicals are aligned with radical farm groups and seek a class collaborative form of socialism."
TEX_social_democrat_party:0 "Progressive Party"
TEX_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Progressive Party - Most of the former progressive Republicans have ended up in the Progressive Party which ran before the Civil War. Without a national organ to draw from, the National Progressives are gradually absorbing them and making them a sub-wing of their organization."
TEX_social_liberal_party:0 "National Progressive Party"
TEX_social_liberal_party_long:0 "National Progressive Party - Part of the Republican Party has collapsed into the National Progressive Party, a creation of the Wisconsin-based La Follette family and one of the few major challengers to Long's agenda, with the party claiming to be more progressive than populist."
TEX_market_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The liberal democrats in the region desire a reunion with the pro-democratic factions of America at once if possible, only agreeing to work with the AUS to stop more radical factions. That said they do pay more lip service to farmers relative to other wings of the liberal democrats throughout the nation."
TEX_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
TEX_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party in the region that operates legally have often had to made concessions to populist rhetoric but in practice largely work with the AUS out of fear of the Old Democrats, non-local big business and Socialists. Supportive of segregation, their support would likely wane if lip service was paid to race progressives."
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The America First Party is a populist-American broad tent made up of those who follow a laborist, patriotic ideology and also generally view left socialism as being unpatriotic or totalitarian. They stand in opposition to other progressives by their reliance on political machines, their Share the Wealth Plan, relative cultural conservatism, populist-messaging, party militias and, more than anything, their personalism based around Louisiana Governor and firebrand Huey Long. As such they preach an odd mixture of radicalism, populism and pragmatism in order to enact a pro-labor and pro-famer capitalist nation united around the American identity."
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_national_populist_party:0 "White Leagues"
TEX_national_populist_party_long:0 "White Leagues - The various White Leagues in our territory are unorganized paramilitary organizations cut off the central apparatus of the National Democratic White League. While some have chosen not to take an official side during the war, the vast majority have sympathies with the CAR. Some AUS activists believe we could appeal to them to stop them from actively attacking us while other would see them finished."

TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The Radicals of the AFP view traditional voting as inadequate to the American people due to the influence of large corporations and banks, and believe a presidential dictatorship enveloped in populism would better represent the will of the American people."
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_progressive_AFP_social_democrat_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is progressive-populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation or progressivism in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_liberal_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is liberal populism which defends and even seeks to enact further welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race moderation in favor of strong civic nationalism."
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party:0 "America First Party"
TEX_liberal_AFP_social_conservative_party_long:0 "America First Party - The AFP has enacted its populist agenda and in the process it has made it clear the future of the party is conservative populism which defends welfare progressivism, pro-labor policies and race conservatism."

TEX_christian_party:0 "Christian Party"
TEX_christian_party_long:0 "Christian Party - The official political-wing of the Silver Legion of America and a creation of William Dudley Pelley, the CP has largely absorbed both conservative populists and former democrats in the religious nationalist party. United by populist proposals of patriotism, universal employment and a minimum income for full citizens, the CP differs from the AFP and NPP in the emphasis on its military wing, Pelley's writings, harsher attitude towards socialism, citizen referendums, more explicitly Christian-based welfare, stricter constitutionalism, cultural supremacism (including overt anti-Semitism), and Pelley's ward policy towards groups of people he views as unproductive. As such the group is unsurprisingly extremely divisive even with the populist AUS, not helped by its even more radical-wing of the party being even more overtly racialist as well openly authoritarian, with many unsure how far Pelley would go to appease them."
TEX_christian_party_auth:0 "Christian Party"

TEX_national_populist_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League"
TEX_national_populist_catholic_party_long:0 "The Holy American League - Originally the Papal Militia sent by His Holiness to aid the Union State in the civil war, under the leadership of Philip Carroll the Militia has changed dramatically. Coined the Holy American League after the war, there is little the League does NOT do. Everything from building homes for the poor to training Catholics in the art of self defense. With the success of the New Gunpowder Plot, governing can be added to that list. Since coming power, the League has begun to implement Integralism throughout America. If the League can succeed in it's crusade to bring Political Catholicism to one of the most protestant nations on earth is a question that only God or time will be able to tell."
                          
TEX_national_populist_deadphill_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League-Hardliner Faction"
TEX_national_populist_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Hardliner Faction - To their opponents, the Hardliner faction of the Holy American League are paranoid Inquisitors with a thirst for blood. To the Hardliners themselves, they are vessels of God and the Holy Mother who carry out their work in protecting the Empire from sin and heresy. With the death of the ArchRegent, it is an open secret that they seek to consolidate power and cast out their rival factions, lest the Empire fall once more head first into the rotting pit of Masonic Liberalism. To them, the Empire has already strayed too far from Christ into the dangerous realm of secularism, and it is their mission to reaffirm the Empire as the tool of the Church to bring salvation from fiery Gehenna to all souls, even if that means taking a life. Indeed, their leader, Father Leonard Feeney, is an ambitious and devoted man, only time will tell what lengths the Hardliners would be willing to go to save the Empire."
                         
TEX_paternal_autocrat_deadphill_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League-Neo-Feudalist Faction"
TEX_paternal_autocrat_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Neo-Feudalist Faction - The Neo-Feudalist faction of the Holy American League has seemingly risen to prominence overnight. Commanded by the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, Martin Carmody, the Neo-Feudalists are still shrouded in mystery. What is known is that most of the Knights of Columbus is extremely loyal to their Supreme Knight, and that Carmody has established connections to many networks and groups within the Empire. In the few times Carmody has emerged from the shadows of heading the secret police, he has expressed a desire to bring feudalism to America. Many have dismissed this as the silly dream of a man stuck in the past, but with the power of the Knights of Columbus behind him, Carmody’s vision is no laughing matter. The other factions of the League must be alert, lest they be the targets when the Knights make their next move in their march to revive feudalism."
               
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_deadphill_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League-Populist Faction"
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Populist Faction - The Populist faction of the Holy League is perhaps the most vocal of all in its mission. Under the authority of Father Charles Coughlin, the Populists have done all they can to make their voice heard the loudest. Millions listen in as Coughlin speaks on the need for a return the the populist policies of America First in order for the Empire to survive. This goal is a very popular one, as many citizens of the Empire look back on phrases like “Every Man a King” with fondness, and Coughlin’s words only help to stir up their nostalgia. The Populists also wish to curtail the powers of the Inquisition, with Coughlin and many others believing that the purges have become far too excessive. With their dual goals of “Holy Populism” and the cutting back of the much feared Inquisition, it is without question that the Populists are very popular, and certainly a force to be reckoned with."
                      
TEX_social_conservative_deadphill_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League-Loyalist Faction"
TEX_social_conservative_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Loyalist Faction - The Loyalist faction, headed by the faithful Bishop Fulton Sheen, seeks to not only uphold the work of the ArchRegent Carroll but also continue his divine mission. Sheen, the “Beloved Disciple” of the ArchRegent is determined to carry out Carroll’s vision as closely as possible. However, the faction also has the stated goal of moderating the Empire. Sheen claims this keeps to the ArchRegent’s will, as with his dying breaths he told Sheen to be his successor and to reform the Empire. Others, especially the Hardliners, have brought this into question, pointing out that only Sheen heard his final words and therefore no one else can confirm this final wish of the ArchRegent. Regardless, the Loyalist Faction marches on, determined to continue the glorious work that the late Carroll started."
              
TEX_market_liberal_deadphill_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League-Christian Capitalist Faction"
TEX_market_liberal_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Christian Capitalist Faction - The right wing of the Reformist Faction within the Holy American League is shaping up to be a major contender in the Empire’s politics. United under the banner of former New York Governor Al Smith, the Right-Reformist Faction pushes for a revived Free Market capitalism to be adopted as the Empire’s economic system, under he moniker, “Christian Capitalism.” Much like it’s left wing counterpart, Smith’s Right Reformists push for a democratization of the Empire, but with the more moderate end goal of bringing the federalist model back to the country. These aims have attracted many moderates and conservatives who wish for a return to a more liberal and laissez-faire system while not abandoning Catholic values. The faction’s supporters may be old-fashioned, but they are no less determined to bring a new era of freedom and prosperity to the Empire"               
                 

TEX_radical_socialist_deadphill_catholic_party:0 "Holy American League-Catholic Worker Faction"
TEX_radical_socialist_deadphill_catholic_party_long:0 "Holy American League-Catholic Worker Faction - The left wing of the Reformist Faction(dubbed the Catholic Worker Faction) within the Holy American League has become increasingly prominent with the death of the Archregent. Under the leadership of Dorothy Day, the Left-Reformist Faction pushes for fully embracing distributist economics, gender egalitarianism, democratization and, most controversially, the decentralization of the Empire. Also controversial is the lack of a denial from the Faction regarding its constant accusations of anarchist and syndicalist sympathies. Despite its many detractors, it is an undeniable fact that the Catholic Workers have garnered immense popularity among the working class and female population of the Empire, and are undoubtedly a powerful force within the League."

TEX_authoritarian_democrat_deadphill_joe_party:0 "Holy American League-National Cavalier Faction"
TEX_authoritarian_democrat_deadphill_joe_party_long:0 "Holy American League-National Cavalier Faction - Following the deadlocked and indecisive Congress in St. Mary’s City, Joseph Kennedy led a military coup that seized the reins of power within the Empire. Now Kennedy and his followers, calling themselves the “National Cavaliers” have defanged the Holy American League, turning it into little more than pen-pushing, rubber-stamping yes-men to keep some shred of legitimacy. In actuality, the Empire has become a military junta in all but name. The Cavaliers call the shots now, and they have not hesitated to crush the “Enemies of Our Lady”— those that pose a threat to the junta. At the same time, Kennedy has promised a return to the stability and prosperity before the ArchRegent’s death, though the junta’s policy of putting the military first has led many to be skeptical that Kennedy will look after anything except his own goons and power. Even still, the people pledge their loyalty and hold faith that the Lord will guide Kennedy’s hand."

TEX_national_populist_deadphill_regent_party:0 "Holy American League-National Salvation Faction"
TEX_national_populist_deadphill_regent_party_long:0 "Holy American League-National Salvation Faction - Following the deadlocked and indecisive Congress in St. Mary's City, a compromise was found. No faction would be the one to rule them all, instead, every faction would rule...partially. Aspects of the factions' doctrines have been incorporated into the new "National Salvation Decree", which outlines the new policies that will be observed by the Empire. It has been decided that the Congress in St. Mary's will remain as a permanent governing institution, based on the model of the Ecumenical Councils. Officially this Council is the "Council of Guadalupe", but the introduction of the National Salvation Decree has led to many dubbing it the "National Salvation Faction." Guided by the hand of the Divine Trinity, the Regency shall carry the Empire into a holy future.""

TEX_totalist_deadphill_party:0 "Red Legion of America"
TEX_totalist_deadphill_party_long:0 "The Red Legion of America- Formed as a merger of the largest anti-Day groups from all around the Empire, the Red Legion of America is the very definition of a contradiction. They support reintroducing segregation, even promoting policies like the Liberia Plan, which clearly places them in league with groups such as the Klan. Meanwhile, their unwavering support of Socialism and the Worker's Revolution clearly puts them in the camp of groups like the defunct Combined Syndicates. With a monarchist wing to top the cake, the Red Legion simply should not function as it does. Regardless of it's contradictory nature though, the Legionaries of the Red Legion march on, determined to remove Dorothy Day and create the perfect Socialist Kingdom for God's chosen race, the White Man."

TEX_texan_democrat_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party, now a revitalized force under the leadership of Pappy O'Daniel, stands poised to rebuild the country from the ruins of war and economic depression alike. Texas has taken its rightful place as the leading American state, and its culture and values will surely have as profound of an impact on American culture as the Hillbilly Boys have in recent years. Though O'Daniel has his work set out for him, it seems that every American has heard the phrase "pass the biscuits, Pappy", a testament to his charisma and popularity. With the people behind him, O'Daniel will bring his vision to America."

TEX_dewey_plan_idea:0 "The Dewey Plan, named after the legendary Bellamyist scholar, will aim to revolutionize education in the country. The main ideas of the plan are to make education into a more interactive affair, allowing students to participate in social reform given its new existence as a social instituion. Further, Dewey's emphasis on education as a place to learn not only knowledge but how to live makes it clear that education will be much more pragmatic for generations to come."

TEX_production_for_use_idea:0 "Production-For-Use"
TEX_production_for_use_idea_desc:0 "Production-For-Use is by far the most important part of Alfred Bingham's vision. An ideal society, one that understands that there are abundant resources for everyone, operates not out of profit but out of demand. Production must be driven by what people need, not by what can make the most money. As a result, we will save wasted resources and have a more efficient and satisfied populace."

TEX_no_speculation_idea_desc:0 "Speculation is a practice that has plagued the American people for too long. To ensure that wealth is more democratically spread, as Bingham and the late Huey Long desired, we must eliminate the greedy practices of bankers and the wealthy once and for all. With more wealth in the hands of the middle class and the poor, we can create a more just and honest economy."

Industrial democracy, held up by a harmonious consensus of people living in abundance, must power our new society. However, while community will be strong, so too will the sense of personality that each person will enjoy in this society; with more time on their hands and a more equal living condition, our people can explore themselves to the fullest, and the country will prosper as a result."
TEX_middle_classes_idea:0 "The Middle Class Mind"
TEX_middle_classes_idea_desc:0 "At the end of the day, it is not property that drives class; it is pscyhology. For revolution to succeed in America, it must be tailored to the middle classes, whose support is paramount to our continued rule. However, this is not limited to the economic middle classes, but instead to all those who consider themselves a member of the middle class, which is a significantly larger part of society. By taking advantage of this identification, and uniting labor and the economic middle class, we can lay the foundations for a radical organization of society."
TEX_outflanking_capitalists_idea:0 "Outflanking the Capitalists"
TEX_outflanking_capitalists_idea_desc:0 "The first major step in Bingham's economic transformation is to have a vertical cross section of the economy that is operated on a production for use basis. First, the unemployed will be brought into this system, but after a year, admittance will be voluntary. The resources of our nation will be leased to the government from factory owners and empty lands, and we will begin our experiment."

Economic resources, now in the hands of the government, can be used more efficienctly for the prosperity of the country. With an increasingly planned economy, we will be more productive than ever before. However, we must take care to ensure we do not upset the middle classes we rely upon for support. As a result, we will not completely overhaul the economy, but the mere efficiency of our system will convince them to support it..." 
TEX_society_of_plenty_idea:0 "Societ of Plenty"
TEX_society_of_plenty_idea_desc:0 "In our new society, there is no hoarding of resources. Instead, we can enjoy the natural abundance of resources in the vast country we live in, and wealth, both in resources and otherwise, will flow through our population."
TEX_tactical_patriotism_idea:0 "Tactical Patriotism"
TEX_tactical_patriotism_idea_desc:0 "To appeal to the masses of Americans, we must appeal to their patriotic and nationalistic instincts. While this may not be ideal for us, it is no crime to have pride in one's country, and if we want a sustainable revolution, we must pre-empty any would-be nationalistic challengers from stealing our base of support from under our noses. If our people are fighting for their country, they will be all the more motivated towards our cause. However, this patriotism may be hard to control at first..."
TEX_tactical_patriotism_two_idea:0 "Lure Em' In"
TEX_tactical_patriotism_two_idea_desc:0 "Now that we have established ourselves as a truly patriotic government, we can use this perception to our advantage. By continuing to foster nationalism amongst the people, we can build a socialist movement that will bring the country that nationalists so desperately want, and without the fear of being overthrown. We will pay special attention to the military and entertainment, such as films and sports, to continue cultivating this weapon." 
TEX_uncorrupted_government_idea:0 "Honesty and Government" 
TEX_uncorrupted_government_idea_desc:0 "Though it may sound like a joke to some and an impossibility to others, we are confident that one of the first steps to restoring our nation should be to create an honest government. To the extent it is possible, we should try to eliminate big business influence in our politics, and ensure that government is of, for, and by the people. Huey Long had his faults, but his dream of a government that serves the people must be realized!"
TEX_american_families_idea:0 "The New American Family"
TEX_american_families_idea_desc:0 "To continue our reforms in America, we must emphasize the role of the family. The family is the unit which keeps the country stable, the glue that keeps it united. Without strong families, we would be left with little. Let us give subsidies to our families and support the replenishment of our population."
TEX_christian_support_idea:0 "Christian Support"
TEX_christian_support_idea_desc:0 "Though we are pious in our cause, we have sometimes struggled to gain the support of the church. Huey Long was never one to appreciate their potential, so now, we must court them ourselves. Faith will be paramount for building a new America, and we must ensure that the Bible is followed in the daily lives of every American, so that a moral America can emerge!"
TEX_currency_reform_idea:0 "Currency Reform"
TEX_currency_reform_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey Long started the process of currency reform, we must continue it. The old ideal of greenback currency, which the National Progressives espouse, would be an excellent start to this reform, although it is unknown what form it will take after that. For now though, we must protect our farmers from greedy bankers and investors, ensuring they will be safe to live normal lives once more."
TEX_virtuous_america_idea:0 "The New Republic"
TEX_virtuous_america_idea_desc:0 "America, as a republic, was founded on sound values, but lost its way after decades of corruption and incompetent administration. Now, with Huey Long beginning the work of reforming the country and our government continuing that work, we can have a virtuous republic once more. Democracy has been restored, and the people rejoice with their newfound power!"
TEX_chicago_plan_idea:0 "The Chicago Plan"
TEX_chicago_plan_idea_desc:0 "Originating from the University of Chicago, the Chicago Plan aims to separate monetary and credit functions within the banking system, with the goal of eliminating the danger of banks not being able to pay back all of their loans. Ideally, the banks would neither create money nor affect the money supply, and instead, money would be nationalized. This will stabilize our economy and hopefully help us recover from our recent economic woes."
TEX_press_freedom_idea:0 "Restore Press Freedoms"
TEX_press_freedom_idea_desc:0 "One of the longest traditions in our nation is the freedom of the press. Under Huey Long's wartime administration, these freedoms were curbed, but we must restore them if we are to continue his vision for America. After all, a friendly media could do wonders for our popularity..."
TEX_afp_machine_idea:0 "The AFP Machine"
TEX_afp_machine_idea_desc:0 "During Huey Long's life, he was able to establish a powerful Longist political machine to help him retain power. Now that he is dead, however, we have been forced to seize control of this wide operation, so that we could use it to our own advantage across the country. With the political machine firmly in our grasp, we will control the entire nation for years to come..."
TEX_media_help_idea:0 "Media to the Rescue!"
TEX_media_help_idea_desc:0 "For decades, the newspapers have been a source of consternatinon and relief alike for politicians anxiously waiting to see if their campaigns could win the hearts and minds of voters. Now, with the advent of the radio, the media is more important than ever. With their support, we can drown out any opponent, domestic or foreign. We must ensure our control of this institution, for if we control the media, we will control the nation as well."
TEX_finish_industrialists_idea:0 "Subservient Corporations"
TEX_finish_industrialists_idea_desc:0 "For too long, this country has suffered under the control of greedy industrialists. It was always Huey's dream to end their outsized influence in America, and we must finish what he started. By nationalizing major industries and taxing the richest among their numbers, the industrialists can be brought to heel and our control will be solidifed. Towards a new American economy!"
TEX_help_vets_idea:0 "Care for the Veterans"
TEX_help_vets_idea_desc:0 "Our veterans, the millions of men who have fought bravely for our side, must be taken care of. Huey Long certainly thought so; he never shied away from promising the veterans that they would be well compensated after the war, and would be among the first to see the realiziation of his vision of "Every Man a King". Now that he is gone, however, we must act on these promises. Through increased subsidies, homes, and more for our veterans, we can ensure stability and a happy population."
TEX_ending_poverty_idea:0 "An End to Poverty"
TEX_ending_poverty_idea_desc:0 "Perhaps the most important part of Huey Long's dream was the achievement of a country free from poverty. It would be a country where wealth was more fairly spread, where every man was a king in his own right. Though he perished before he had the time to see his vision to fruition, we have finished his work, and now, America stands strong once more. No longer shall we suffer the disease of poverty!"
TEX_earl_machine_idea:0 "Uncle Earl's Machine"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_desc:0 "Though Earl Long is Huey's brother and natural successor, his brother's political machine was by no means an easy thing to control, or acquire for that matter. Now that we have moved to secure it for Earl's cause, however, we are one step closer to securing our position as Huey's successor and the rightful government of the country. Now we just have to hold on to this machine..."
TEX_earl_machine_idea_2:0 "True Man of the People"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_2_desc:0 "Though Huey Long was famous for fighting for the people, it is in his brother Earl that the downtrodden American can find a true ally. Across the country, farmers, workers, and the homeless can all find a friend in Earl Long, who always preferred their company to that of perfumed politicians. His constant desire to be with his people has inspired new support for himself and his administration, and now we will reap the benefits of his charismatic, down-to-earth approach."
TEX_earl_machine_idea_3:0 "Loved by the People"
TEX_earl_machine_idea_3_desc:0 "Earl Long, now having built a name for himself and distinguishing himself from his older brother, can finally look with pride at what he has built. A political network; a network run by Earl and his closest allies, which now controls the nation. More importantly, though, Uncle Earl has ingratiated himself with the people, and with their resounding approval, can continue to fight for them as hard as they fought for him."
TEX_the_three_ps_idea:0 "Politicking, Plain People, and Pea Patch Farm"
TEX_the_three_ps_idea_desc:0 "Though he may come off as a simple but well-meaning politician to some, in reality, Earl Long is a master politician, rivaling his brother in his ability to whip up crowds and win supporters. Never one to enter political rivalries in the hopes of gaining the support of both sides, Earl Long has successfully navigated the vipers nest of the post-assassination government, and now can visit his beloved Pea Patch Farm in peace, mingling with hundreds of locals and travelers alike. His toil, both on his farm and for the country, has given us prosperity beyond our wildest dreams!"
TEX_retail_taxation_idea:0 "The Gas, Beer, and Retail Tax"
TEX_retail_taxation_idea_desc:0 "To help pay for some of our programs and to give our administration more funding for research purposes, we have decided to levy new taxes on gas, beer, and retail purchases. These may be unpopular at first, but at least our people will be better able to pay them..."
TEX_end_civil_service_idea:0 "End the Civil Service"
TEX_end_civil_service_idea_desc:0 "Since entrenched politicians nationwide, especially in the South, have given strong resistance to Earl Long and his reforms, Long has decided that he must take action. To strike the power of these politicians, he has declared an end to the Civil Service system, denying corrupt politicians their support base. Instead, patronage will be given from the president's office, and we will be all the more powerful because of it."
TEX_black_enfranchisement_idea:0 "Extend the Franchise"
TEX_black_enfranchisement_idea_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the First Civil War, many freed slaves hoped for the right to vote, and for a time, they enjoyed this right. However, the arrival of Jim Crow laws denied voting rights to African-Americans in large swaths of America, and now, this policy must end. Though Earl Long has often used the rhetoric of morality and liberalism on this issue, it is clear that the prospect of a new voting base also interests him, but who will complain?"
TEX_take_care_of_people_idea:0 "Food for the Needy"
TEX_take_care_of_people_idea_desc:0 "To gain further support amongst potential voters and to further Huey's vision of making "Every Man a King", Earl Long has decided to implement food programs to feed the poor and those in schools. This includes a free lunch program and efforts to ensure that the most impoverished parts of our country are at least somewhat fed. With that accomplished, we can look forward to a more productive workforce and a higher morale for our population overall." 
TEX_take_care_of_people_2_idea:0 "Better Hospital Care"
TEX_take_care_of_people_2_idea_desc:0 "To Earl Long, taking care of the people must involve giving them adequate hospital access when they are sick or injured. The state of hospitals in rural Louisiana, and the rest of rural America for that matter, is abysmal to say the least. With a focus on modernized hospitals, in rural areas and elsewhere, we can ensure that our people will at least be able to get the care they need. Though Huey Long perished from his assassination injuries, Earl Long reasons, the hospital he was taken to did its best to save him, and that should be the standard for anyone." 
TEX_christian_renewal_idea:0 "Fourth Great Awakening"
TEX_christian_renewal_idea_desc:0 "As part of his program to rebuild the country after the devastation it faced in the past decade, Gerald K. Smith hopes to create a Fourth Great Awakening in the country. Taking inspiration from the previous three movements, there will be a resurgence in Christians, particularly Protestants, as Americans remember the faith that once guided them through even the hardest of times. With their faith renewed, our people can begin to heal."
TEX_christian_renewal_2_idea:0 "Family Support Plan"
TEX_christian_renewal_2_idea_desc:0 "Families are the cornerstone of our nation, and though Huey Long did his best to support them, we must continue his work. Subsidies will be given to devastated families and couples, especially those of veterans and other loyal citizens, in the hopes that they will be encouraged to have more children."
TEX_christian_renewal_3_idea:0 "New Longist Disciples"
TEX_christian_renewal_3_idea_desc:0 "Though Gerald K. Smith loved Huey Long like few others could have, he believes it is crucial that we do not forget him. The younger generation, too young to understand Huey Long's message at the time and now growing up into a world without him, should be taught about his deeds, and we should ensure that Smith is viewed as the heir to his movement. With the support of this new Longist and Christian youth, we will create an America that would make Huey proud."
TEX_christian_renewal_4_idea:0 "American Morality"
TEX_christian_renewal_4_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey Long was of course right to see part of the source of America's rot in its greedy businessmen and inhumane treatment of the poor, part of the cause was also a decline in morality. Throughout the past decade, marriages and families alike declined, and crime racked the country. Now though, with Smith finishing the Share the Wealth vision of Huey Long, we have restored morality to the country once more."
TEX_smith_veterans_idea:0 "Smith's Veterans"
TEX_smith_veterans_idea_desc:0 "During the Civil War, Smith built a fierce reputation as a military leader, beloved by his men and feared by enemies on all sides. Now that the war is over, a large contingent of our veterans feel a sense of loyalty towards Smith. If the need arises, we will be able to call these men up once more to defend their country and Smith's movement. With their help, we will not be defeated!"
TEX_masses_propaganda_idea:0 "Propaganda for the Masses"
TEX_masses_propaganda_idea_desc:0 "With a reputation as perhaps the most charismatic man on Earth, Gerald K. Smith has decided to continue his rousing speeches to the people, reminiscent of Huey Long's old barnstorming speeches. The speeches are meant to gather more support for Smith's policies, increase his own popularity, and even inspire the people. Using the greatest tool at his disposal, Smith will bring America towards a new age of prosperity."
TEX_new_silver_idea:0 "Remonetized Silver"
TEX_new_silver_idea_desc:0 "In a bid to jumpstart the economy, continue Huey Long's policies, and shore up his own support, Charles Coughlin has declared the remonetization of silver. With a silver-backed currency, the economy will be more stable, allowing us to increase the money supply as needed. With these new resources, we can take care of all Americans."
TEX_new_silver_2_idea:0 "Tax Relief for the Poor"
TEX_new_silver_2_idea_desc:0 "Though Huey was right when he demanded the wealthy pay their fair share, we must give relief to the underprivileged parts of the country. It is the Christian thing to do, and it is an excellent political move as well: as long as we have the people on our side, we will be safe from threats inside and out. Further, Coughlin hopes that giving relief to the poor will allow them to spend this newfound money, and the economy will boom as a result. Taking care of our people is taking care of our country."
TEX_new_silver_3_idea:0 "Efficient and Honest Government"
TEX_new_silver_3_idea_desc:0 "A problem that Huey Long's government shared with the old government in Washington is that it was bloated and corrupt. We must streamline our day-to-day tasks and cut unnecessary programs, so that we operate a more responsible economy and country. If we can manage all of this, we will be one step closer to Coughlin's vision of what a true government should be."
TEX_new_silver_4_idea:0 "Liberty of Conscience"
TEX_new_silver_4_idea_desc:0 "Although the state has a large role to play in Coughlin's plans for America, it will not be allowed to overstep into people's lives. We must give our people the liberty of conscience that they live in a righteous and moral nation, a nation that will help them when they falter and leave them alone in prosperous times. We will follow the principles of Social Justice and ensure that all can follow their chosen avocation in life."
TEX_wealth_conscription_idea:0 "Wealth Conscription"
TEX_wealth_conscription_idea_desc:0 "In these times of crisis, we must enact a conscription of wealth on the nation. The wealthy must contribute to the defense and the rebuilding of the nation from its smoldering ruins, and through our new wealth, we can afford many necessities that would be out of our reach otherwise. New research can be conducted, resources gained, logistics secured, and with these factors, we will have a stronger nation than ever before!"
TEX_national_sermons_idea:0 "National Sermons"
TEX_national_sermons_idea_desc:0 "Before Coughlin was ever in power, he gave radio speeches to his nationwide audience, with millions listening to his political rants. Now that we hold power and legitimacy, we can use this radio history to our advantage. Coughlin will continue to sermonize on the radio, making the case for his policies and acting as a moral guide for our people. The radio is a powerful tool at Coughlin's disposal, and he will use it wisely."
TEX_our_economy_idea:0 "Our Economy"
TEX_our_economy_idea_desc:0 "Now that we have broken the financial slavery we suffered under various shadowy financiers, we can use our economy as we see fit. New factories and resources are now fully under our control, and keeping with his usual rhetoric, Coughlin promises a more efficient economy than ever before!"
TEX_christian_capitalism_idea:0 "Christian Capitalism"
TEX_christian_capitalism_idea_desc:0 "Though Capitalism must be reformed, the most important thing is ensuring that the true principles of Christianity are followed. We will care for the poor, and though Capitalism will still exist, the wealthy will be strongly encouraged to engage in philanthropic practices. By keeping a careful eye on the corporations and ensuring the people are moral and happy, we can get our economy back on track."
TEX_exalt_humble_idea:0 "Protect the Humble"
TEX_exalt_humble_idea_desc:0 "Many of our people still face poverty in the aftermath of the destructive Civil War. To combat this, we must emphasize them as the group that we will legislate for, and by uplifting the humblest among us, we will uplift the entire nation. Though we are focused on the poor, we will take care to not target the wealthy too much, but they will pay their fair share. With everyone pitching in, we will move forward into a new age."
TEX_punish_wealth_idea:0 "Punish Greed"
TEX_punish_wealth_idea_desc:0 "If our reforms are to succeed, we must break the power of monopolists and industrialists once and for all. These are the same groups that fought against Huey Long's reforms, and with their wealth, we will be able to benefit the entire nation. This is a fact that the wealthy are unable to grasp; their focus on the short-term blinds them. We must punish them for their short-sightedness and greed and ensure that America is a nation for all its people, not just those at the top."
TEX_ban_unions_idea:0 "Hardworking Americans"
TEX_ban_unions_idea_desc:0 "Rather than having our people join unions, we will place an emphasis on hard work over all else. America has always been known for its work ethic, and to complete the vision of Huey Long, we must utilize this quality."
TEX_loyal_unions_idea:0 "Loyal Laborers"
TEX_loyal_unions_idea_desc:0 "The important thing in the conflict between capital and labor is loyalty. With industrialists weakened already, we should now turn to the unions, and ensure their loyalty. During the Civil War, many of these unions sided with the CSA, but those that sided with Huey Long are now among the most powerful in the country. Their loyal support means that we do not have to worry about factory sabotage or inefficient work; the unions will do their work, as negotiated, and we will be all the better for it."
TEX_subsidized_unions_idea:0 "Subsidize the Workers"
TEX_subsidized_unions_idea_desc:0 "A happy worker is a productive one, and to ensure our workers are happy, we must make their voices heard. Through an official endorsement and subsidization of unions, our government can bring them firmly to our side, while simultaneously making sure they are powerful enough to challenge corporations."

Over the years however, the Knights began to shift from only an insurance company to a Catholicism Advocacy Group. It was with the Holy American League's blessing that the Knights now take yet another role. The order has been militarized! All Knights of Columbus are now sworn to protect Holy Mother Church, her teachings and her priests by force of arms. As America is now being more and more integrated with the Church, the Knight's oath now leads them to protect and serve our government, to the death if Our Lord wills it."

While the Anglicans and Secularists may scoff, the people of North and South America clamor for a return to Truth, for a return to Sanity, a return to Tradition. Just as Our Lord heard the cries of the Israelites enslaved in Egypt and sent Moses to free them, so has God heard the cry of the people of the Americas. In place of Moses, Carroll and Raposo, united in the One True Faith shall free the peoples of the Americas and they shall stop at nothing until all are free to worship God in peace."

TEX_Devers_plan2:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan2_desc:0 "The first step in Devers's plan to reform the military is to take a tally of the officers deserving of promotion for heroism and those deserving of demotion for wasteful actions. Those deserving will be recalled to the capital to meet with our new suppliers."
TEX_Devers_plan3:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan3_desc:0 "The second step for Devers is to assess the state of the forts and weapon stocks scattered across the country. Equipment that is in need of repair or is deemed too dangerous will be removed and recycled."
TEX_Devers_plan4:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan4_desc:0 "With the officers now informed and our weapons stocked, it is time for Devers to arrange the order of battle around the national strategy. This may dissapoint generals who enjoyed abusing their authority to make risky manoeuvres, but this is progress."
TEX_Devers_plan5:0 "Devers Reform Plan"
TEX_Devers_plan5_desc:0 "With Devers' reforms finished, our army now stands at the forefront of military tactics and organization, with an expanded logistical service and the latest in force weaponry, we will be able to respond to any threat, no matter how many enemys they send after us."

TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_desc:0 "The first part of Terrible Terry's plan involves him taking more direct control of our military.

TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_2:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_2_desc:0 "The next step in the Terrible Terry plan is concerned with organizing our troops further. Specifically, he hopes to emphasize cavalry. This will allow us to plan better against our enemy, and see what they are planning before we arrive on the battlefield."
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_3:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_3_desc:0 "Terrible Terry does not want to repeat the predictability of Weltkrieg generals. He prefers his enemies to know as little about his tactics as possible, and in the pursuit of that goal, has aimed for an unpredictable strategy. Such a strategy has several benefits for our troops. With an emphasis on speed and unpredictability, we will be unstoppable in the field." 
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_4:0 "Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr. Plan"
TEX_la_mesa_plan_idea_4_desc:0 "Night Assaults are a crucial part of the Terrible Terry plan. With this element of surprise, we can overcome our enemy with secret plans and better training, especially if they are too exhaused to fight back."

TEX_minister_smith_idea_5_desc:0 "Populism is a powerful force in our military, but it is not enough.

TEX_lighning_joe_idea_3:0 "Lightning Joe Doctrine"
TEX_lighning_joe_idea_3_desc:0 "The next part of Lightning Joe's plan involves changes to our assembly line production, so that we can produce equipment more efficiently, especially artillery. This will boost our output and ensure we have an edge over our enemies on the battlefield. 
TEX_lighning_joe_idea_4:0 "Lightning Joe Doctrine"
TEX_lighning_joe_idea_4_desc:0 "If our artillery can be coordinated with other areas of our army, and with each other, we can have a much more effective means of bombarding our enemy. We should work to ensure that this is the case, for our explosive power may just win us this war."
TEX_lighning_joe_idea_5:0 "Lightning Joe Doctrine"
TEX_lighning_joe_idea_5_desc:0 "Lightning Joe believes we should concentrate our firepower on certain sections of the enemy forces, so that we can punch holes where they are weakest and sap their strength where they are strongest.

TEX_reconcile_coughlin:0 "Reconcile with Coughlin"
TEX_reconcile_coughlin_desc:0 "Charles Coughlin has always had strained relations with [TEX.GetLeader], but this relationship has only worsened in recent weeks. With a powerful radio show and an intimidating following, Coughlin has never been the closest Huey Long confidant, instead more or less operating his own faction within the party. This has caused Coughlin some problems, and most of all, he has faced accusations of disloyalty. Regardless though, he wields a significant power base, and we would be wise to offer concessions in the form of a watered-down version of his 'Social Justice' plan."
TEX_reconcile_smith:0 "Reconcile with Smith"
TEX_reconcile_smith_desc:0 "Gerald L.K. Smith has sharply criticized [TEX.GetLeader] in the aftermath of Huey's demise, and most of our advisors speculate that this is because he expected to succeed his idol and lead the country in what he believes is Huey's vision. Others attribute his abrasiveness to a fear of being sidelined on the national political stage. Whatever the case may be, Smith is one of the most charismatic men in the country, and bringing him to our side would benefit us much more than eliminating him from politics altogether. However, Gerald L.K. Smith is not an easily tamed man, and to win his supoprt, we will have to offer certain concessions, ranging from farmer subsidies to going after groups Smith alledges were involved in Huey's assassination."
TEX_reconcile_earl:0 "Reconcile with Earl Long"
TEX_reconcile_earl_desc:0 "Earl Long, lovingly dubbed 'Uncle Earl' by his nephew and his supporters, is no fan of [TEX.GetLeader], a fact he has made clear in rousing speeches following Huey's demise. Though he had a mixed relationship with his brother, Earl insists that he now represents the interests of the Long family, and winning his support could mean a certain degree of legitimacy in the eyes of many. Further, Uncle Earl brings some talents of his own; he is a captivating storyteller, and an excellent orator beyond that. Most of all though, hidden behind his veneer of plainness, he is a shrewd political actor. We would do well to have his sharp mind on our side, before another group wins his loyalty."
TEX_reconcile_bingham:0 "Reconcile with Bingham"
TEX_reconcile_bingham_desc:0 "Alfred Mitchell Bingham leads a peculiar group, ranging from Bellamyists to Socialists to Technocrats, and everything in between. Whatever their preferred labels may be, however, none are too fond of [TEX.GetLeader], and this is not surprising. After all, their fringe wing of the AFP is rarely represented in party affairs, and we have done little to change that. However, if we wanted to seek out their support, we could give certain concessions in the form of leniency for some of the more left-wing traitors in the former CSA and PSA. Further, they would want us to continue what Huey started in public ownership of industries, going beyond his plans for it, or perhaps to act on healthcare and once and for all establish a national insurance system."

TEX_dismantle_the_dixiecrats_desc:0 "The right-wing Democrats have looked down on Huey Long since he was a lawyer defending the little man from corporations. Now they wish for us to allow their machines to thrive, despite their attempts on the Kingfish's life. Let's see if they are so smug when the radical DWL gets a taste of their own medicine and the regressive Southern machine is wholly replaced by a progressive one."
TEX_black_support:0 "Black Support"
TEX_black_support_desc:0 "With our desire to displace the Old Democrats in their entirety, we have gained a more positive reputation with the country's black population. While Huey has long been ambigious on Civil Rights issues, he has suddenly found himself more vocally supporting increased spending on black communities at the expense of the landed elites of the South, leading to a rapid increase in black AFP supporters."
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie:0 "Shake Hands with Dixie"
TEX_shake_hands_with_dixie_desc:0 "The Old Democrats are finished on a national scale, but their machine in the South remains. The Union made a terrible and costly mistake in bothering to oppose it after the Civil War, one we should not repeat. While we will hunt down the irreconciable White Leagers, we should cut a deal with the Southern Democrats whom now look to us for protection, promising not to uproot them so long as they do not oppose Long."
TEX_a_new_solid_south:0 "A New Solid South"
TEX_a_new_solid_south_desc:0 "The Southern Democratic machine lost the war and as a result learned its place under Long. They are already making appeals to support him on the national level if allowed to maintain their machines in the South and given some autonomy. So long as they weed out radical anti-Longists and pay their share, there is no need to further disrupt the South. They are now a reliable voting block and White League opposition is winding down."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring.

TEX_election_monitoring:0 "Election Monitoring"
TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "The only force that can ensure the democratic process is carried out is the Minutemen, who shall be deployed every November to safeguard voting areas from harm.

With their conviction, we have finally pacified the most extreme faction seeking to destroy the American First Party."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system, which is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labor union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response, a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
TEX_the_american_progress:0 "The American Progress"
TEX_the_american_progress_desc:0 "The AFP newspaper has always been the The American Progress and there is no reason to stop that now.

TEX_veteran_benefits:0 "Veteran Benefits"

TEX_national_political_machine:0 "National Political Machine"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive orders have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty.

TEX_new_democracy:0 "New Democracy"

TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of Louisiana, the president has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission.

TEX_wealth_ceiling_desc:0 "Tycoons of industry have robbed our people for too long. In light of this, we have decided to implement a new wealth cap.

TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses the president has taken out for Every Man a King will require a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself.

TEX_townsend_plan:0 "Townsend Plan"
TEX_townsend_plan_desc:0 "Francis Townsend's plan for ending old age poverty via a generous pension scheme has long been part of Long's platform and will now be enacted.

TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls now show overwhelming support for President Long's re-election.

TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives.

TEX_commodity_controls_desc:0 "The farmers of this nation have been squeezed for too long, despite their goods fueling the rest of America!

It will start with nationalizing utility companies that took an anti-AUS stance and purchasing agricultural goods."
TEX_farm_subsidies:0 "Farm Subsidies"

TEX_keynesian_economics:0 "Keynesian Economics"
TEX_keynesian_economics_desc:0 "The government must ensure the American people never again suffer as they did under the Great Depression.

TEX_scientific_board:0 "Scientific Board"
TEX_scientific_board_desc:0 "The Farmer-Labor Political Federation and the AFP shall enter a symbiotic relationship in embracing scientific planning for basic utilities and commodities while rejecting the radicals desire to do this for other goods.

TEX_coops_plan_desc:0 "A popular concept in both wings of the AFP, farm coops allow for farmers to share their resources with one another.

TEX_radical_economics:0 "Labor Economics"

Legislative elections and a less economically-influential justice system will be reimplemented as seperate entities from the executive branch."
### Pelley Path ###
TEX_christian_party_victory:0 "Christian Party Victory"
TEX_christian_party_victory_desc:0 "In an outcome that has shocked both the nation and onlookers abroad, Huey Long and the America First Party have lost the first elections in America since the conclusion of the civil war. William Dudley Pelley, chairman of the Christian Party and Chief of the Silver Legion, has won both a slim majority in congress and secured the highest office in the land."
TEX_defend_democracy:0 "Defend Democracy"
TEX_defend_democracy_desc:0 "Before his election, the President was called many things. A legionnaire, a syndicalist, a populist tyrant, and so much more. Yet he has always claimed to be dedicated to upholding the American republic and the values on which it was founded. We shall implement a judicial bill that will affirm our committment to trial by jury and the powers of the court, and increase penalties for corruption."
TEX_organize_new_elections:0 "Organize New Elections"
TEX_organize_new_elections_desc:0 "Despite the steady rebuilding of our great nation, some express concern that the AFP was more concerned with its own power than with restoring America. In a bid both to distance ourselves from Long and increase our own popularity it has been decided that the federal government will ensure proper oversight for all state-level elections and remove those who won their seats through legally dubious methods."
TEX_fight_the_terrorists:0 "Fight the Terrorists"
TEX_fight_the_terrorists_desc:0 "Despite the end of the civil war, fighting has not entirely ceased. Ideologues still cling to their beliefs and occasionally strike at us before slinking back into the shadows. President Pelley shall order law enforcement to begin a nationwide crackdown to root out these murderers. Further, the Silver Legion will be deployed to supplement their efforts. America is no place for cowardly traitors!"
TEX_reform_the_fbi:0 "Reform the FBI"
TEX_reform_the_fbi_desc:0 "It was inevitable that government agencies like the FBI would be shattered by the civil war. Despite their hostility to Pelley in the 1930’s the President sees the need and utility of such an organization. Once freed from the grip of Hoover and his gang of sycophants and given proper oversight, they will help ensure the wellbeing of the republic and the upholding of our great laws!"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism:0 "Outlaw Syndicalism"
TEX_outlaw_syndicalism_desc:0 "The SPA’s attempt to destroy our nation has cemented President Pelley's suspicions that these traitors cannot be allowed to legally spread their filth. Effective immediately, all Marxist, Syndicalist, Bolshevist, and other vocal revolutionary left groups will be considered seditious and effectively outlawed. Some may complain that this is deeply authoritarian, but sometimes such measures are needed."
TEX_political_rehabilitation:0 "Political Rehabilitation"
TEX_political_rehabilitation_desc:0 "Despite the inherent evil of their leaders, do we not see that the average syndicalist is simply a man who wishes to have bread on his table? Thus we will direct the Department of Justice to begin drafting lists of currently imprisoned (non-leading) radicals and offer them clemency in return for a renunciation of their former beliefs and a written statement to never again support such causes."
TEX_national_command_structure:0 "National Command Structure"
TEX_national_command_structure_desc:0 "Despite our recent political success, infighting is abundant within the Legion. Local commanders complain of inconsistent orders, accountants skim off the top, and desertion is increasingly commonplace. This is unacceptable and damaging, not only to the Legion, but to America as a whole. The President will call a meeting of top Silver Legionaries to formalize a better command system."
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety:0 "Build Silver Lodges"
TEX_form_new_councils_of_safety_desc:0 "The Silver Lodges were a grand idea devised by Pelley and his top commanders before the Civil War. The idea would involve the Legion purchasing lands on which to build command centers, in-order to facilitate recruitment. With many Lodges destroyed in the fighting, we should further our commitment to the Legion and direct the treasury to allocate funds to units so that they may build new headquarters."
TEX_wrangle_congress:0 "Wrangle Congress"
TEX_wrangle_congress_desc:0 "Despite the Christian Party having won the election, President Pelley has still found our politicians to be a bickering and gridlocked sort. Whilst his legislation does pass, it often takes too much time and requires far too much politicking for Pelley's liking. The solution to this is clear; utilize the radio as our new platform and decry those shysters who would hold up America’s future for their petty games."
TEX_pdol:0 "Expand the Department of Labor"
TEX_pdol_desc:0 "Pelley gained most of his following from his radical economic proposals and the time has come to begin implementing these grand ideas. This monumental effort will begin with a vast expansion of the Department of Labor: in each and every county across our nation, a DoL office will be opened. This will set the groundwork for a truly staggering effort to transform the American economy."
TEX_universal_jobs_registry:0 "Universal Jobs Registry"
TEX_universal_jobs_registry_desc:0 "With the DoL properly expanded, in each county a grand registry of each business and every possible position will be compiled and paired with a list of every worker in that county. The work will be commprehensive, to say the least. The DoL will use this combination to ensure that every American can easily and quickly find work, and when a worker cannot find work in one county, the offices will cooperate and attempt to find jobs for all who need them."
TEX_the_silver_rangers:0 "Expand the Silver Rangers"
TEX_the_silver_rangers_desc:0 "The Silver Rangers are the law enforcement group of the Silver Legion. They work to ensure that dues are paid, regulations are upheld, and that the demeanor of the Legion is in line with what the Chief and President desires. Our government is growing more popular by the day, and it has become apparent that they will need a recruitment drive of their own, lest our whole organization implode in on itself."
TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "The Christian Commonwealth"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "The time has come for Pelley’s most grand idea to be put into motion. The Christian Commonwealth is a vast overhaul of the entire American economy into a hybrid system. In this system, private businesses can still exist, but they will all be subservient to and part of the Commonwealth Corporation. Furthermore all banks will be absorbed into a Central Treasury Bank which will be responsible for distributing credit."
TEX_annual_dividends:0 "Annual Dividends"
TEX_annual_dividends_desc:0 "With the Commonwealth system coming together the next ambitious step must be taken. In every county, a Treasury Bank will be opened and every native-born or naturalized American given an identification number and bank checkbook. From this moment forward, every American will be guaranteed an annual number of credits to ensure that none of our countrymen shall be subjected to the deepest depths of poverty."
TEX_gallahad_fellowship:0 "Galahad Fellowship"
TEX_gallahad_fellowship_desc:0 "Pelley's original Galahad College taught a wide variety of topics, including Christian economics, esotericism and Pelley’s Liberation Doctrine, which has since grown into Soulcraft. While the college closed during the civil war, Pelley has declared the time has come not only for Galahad College to be re-opened, but for the Galahad Fellowship to be formed and sister schools to be opened nationwide."
TEX_universal_education:0 "Universal Education"
TEX_universal_education_desc:0 "Is it not imperative for a society that the next generation be well educated? The President certainly believes so. Pelley has introduced measures to guarantee that every American youth will be granted (depending on the student) either a college scholarship or enrollment in a trade school. The youth will praise our names and future generations will be better equipped to carry on our grand experiment."
TEX_referendum_voting:0 "Referendum Voting"
TEX_referendum_voting_desc:0 "It is time to introduce the CP's proposed reforms to the legislative system. Firstly, we shall allow voters to eject their congressman if they believe they have alienated their constituents. Next, we shall implement a final step in the legislative process where all congressional legislation must require the majority approval of voters it would impact."
TEX_a_better_america:0 "A Better America"
TEX_a_better_america_desc:0 "Though many feared what would become of America under our rule, we have achieved greatness. Every American has a stable income from the Commonwealth, our democracy has been expanded, and Christian values have been restored to their rightful place. To complete out goals we shall fully integrate the so-called "Wards" into the Commonwealth and re-introduce the traditional American Bill of Rights."

TEX_legacy_of_fighting_bob_desc:0 "Bob LaFollette was the original inspiration for the National Progressive Party and supported the foundation of both Progressive Parties. We will pass the LaFollette Bill in his name which will guarantee workers the right to unionize without fear of being fired."
TEX_peace_not_war:0 "People over Arms"
TEX_peace_not_war_desc:0 "Ensuring that the military growth we've seen in the past couple years would not destroy the Republic was one of our promises. It results in needless war and more MacArthurs, and we will see to it that this does not occur. We will shift current military spending to civilian contracts and our future education programs, for our governments stands for peace, not war."
TEX_wisconsin_idea:0 "The Wisconsin Idea"
TEX_wisconsin_idea_desc:0 "The ideal of all men being educated was a dream held by the Founding Fathers, but now it can be a reality. We will follow the Wisconsin Model and, after expanding current schools, fund higher education and trade schools so it costs next-to-nothing for qualified citizens to enter higher education."
TEX_modernized_congress:0 "Modernized Congress"
TEX_modernized_congress_desc:0 "Congress can not hope to stay up with the nation if it never modernizes itself. We should update this institution so that the bitter arguments and inaction of recent times will be a relic of the past."
TEX_farmer_labor_alliance:0 "Farmer-Labor Organization"
TEX_farmer_labor_alliance_desc:0 "We must organize rural and urban workers so that they may intermingle, share mutual aid, and have a shared political lobby. We will campaign for more to join the Farmer-Labor Party and collaborate closely with it."
TEX_proportional_representation:0 "Proportional Representation"
TEX_proportional_representation_desc:0 "An idea long supported by Progressives such as George Norris and Bob La Follette, the first-past-the-post system of voting is badly outdated and encourages party corruption and machines. Proportional Representation must be campaigned for in each state, and the constitution will need to be reformed for such a voting system. This will occur when enough support is gathered, of course."
TEX_granger_coops:0 "The National Grange"
TEX_granger_coops_desc:0 "The National Grange is an honorable American institution that allows the rich and poor to mingle in rural communities and for the former to aid the latter. Encouraging rural mutual aid and farm support, we will have census employees help farmers register for the Grange and give it a grant to expand it."
TEX_plumb_plan:0 "The Plumb Plan"
TEX_plumb_plan_desc:0 "Named for Glenn E. Plumb's plan for cooperative railroads on a national level, the government will sell bonds and use them to purchase railroads. These will be combined in a single public corporation, partially run by the government. The workers and management shall run it in equal measure, and 50% of the profits will go to the workers."
TEX_private_public_planning:0 "Private-Public Planning"
TEX_private_public_planning_desc:0 "The expansion of government planning need not imply overriding private citizens. We will hire a wide range of government planners and contractors who will work with citizens and local councils to help them build ideal housing and local projects."
TEX_empowered_executive:0 "Empowered Executive"
TEX_empowered_executive_desc:0 "The presidency must be able to respond to crises with more vigor if the recent disasters the United States suffered are any example. The President will be given more leniency on economic executive orders, so that they may overcome an inefficient Congress when the need arises."
TEX_democratic_safeguards:0 "Democratic Safeguards"
TEX_democratic_safeguards_desc:0 "Simply because the President has more power does not make him a MacArthurite. Transpareny in government is absolutely neccessary, so we will allow reporters to more easily enter Congress and empower the Judiciary Branch. We shall keep our democracy safe!"
TEX_modern_farms:0 "Modern Farms"
TEX_modern_farms_desc:0 "Farms were devastated by the war, yes, but they were already collapsing before that point. They must be updated with modern instruments and crops.

TEX_national_infrastructure_plan_desc:0 "It's time to make a mass effort towards not only rebuilding, but improving our infrastructure.

TEX_sewer_socialism_desc:0 "Our cities desperately need a rework of their power and water. We will invest in building the neccessary infrastructure demanded by cities, including a mass effort to update their electricity and public health systems. Our cities shall be clean once and for all."
TEX_public_lands:0 "Public Lands"
TEX_public_lands_desc:0 "One of our most important environmental ideas involves the idea of greater public lands. This will allow the federal government control over areas that can be turned into national parks, monuments, and most importantly, government projects."
TEX_greenback_currency:0 "Greenback Currency"
TEX_greenback_currency_desc:0 "The only result of past governmental obsession with stomping out inflation was to reward the lender class and further impoverish those in debts, such as farmers. The Greenback Currency will be named for the old populist party idea and will not be tied to the gold standard. With its introduction, we will create a small amount of inflation to help those in debt."
### Texas Path ###
TEX_pappy_odaniel:0 "Pappy O'Daniel"
TEX_pappy_odaniel_desc:0 "W. Lee O'Daniel, the most prominent right-wing America Firster in Texas, is now in control of the entire American Union State. His administration is almost certain to increase the influence of Texas within the government, but he promises to represent the entirety of America during his time in power. His charismatic radio speeches and calls for prayer have inspired millions, and now we will see what this outsider does with real power..."
TEX_five_point_plan:0 "Five Point Plan"
TEX_five_point_plan_desc:0 "To counter the calls for a "Share the Wealth" plan, O'Daniel has decided to create his own "Five Point Plan". The plan will involve raising millions in new revenue, banning deficit spending, abolishing unnecessary taxes, abolishing capital punishment, and of course, appointing a state-audited budget director. O'Daniel hopes this plan will win the hearts of minds of his people, but there is much work to be done to implement these proposals..."
TEX_texas_values:0 "Texas Values"
TEX_texas_values_desc:0 "From the founding of the American Union State, farmers across the Great Plains have shared influence with Huey Long's Louisiana allies, and yet Texas has not garnered the power it deserves. Now, this will change, and Texas will take its rightful place at the head of the Union State cause, moderating Long's radical proposals with homemade Texas populism, toughness, and religiosity."
TEX_old_age_pensions:0 "Old-Age Pensions"
TEX_old_age_pensions_desc:0 "One area where Huey Long was undoubtedly right was on old-age pensions. O'Daniel made this one of his foremost promises, and he intends to follow through on it. However, since he is unwilling to engage in deficit spending and reluctant to raise taxes, we must find some way to raise the funds for this proposal."
TEX_industrialization_committee:0 "Industrialization Committees"
TEX_industrialization_committee_desc:0 "The Great Plains as a whole are perhaps the least industrialized region of America. If we want these states to have a place, if we want farmers and ranchers to have a voice, we must pursue industrialization. Further, through industrialization, we can bring desperately-needed investment into the country, investment that can help us get back on our feet after the Civil War. For a new America!"
TEX_soil_conservation_act:0 "Soil Conservation Act"
TEX_soil_conservation_act_desc:0 "One of the greatest tragedies of recent times was the Dust Bowl, which devastated our farmers and ranchers and drove millions into despair. This act will hopefully work against soil erosion and by proxy, prevent further environmental devastation from wind and other forces. With this act, we will never suffer another Dust Bowl."
TEX_fight_wasteful_spending:0 "Fight Wasteful Spending"
TEX_fight_wasteful_spending_desc:0 "Some of W. Lee O'Daniel's largest foes in Texas were those who promised their constituents money one way or another but then spent it elsewhere, either to enrich themselves or otherwise pursue their own interests. In fact, O'Daniel believes a significant amount of government spending is nothing more than corruption, and it is rarely used to truly benefit the common man. We must change this, and make spending a more economical, and representative, affair."  
TEX_slice_taxes:0 "Slice Taxes"
TEX_slice_taxes_desc:0 "Pappy O'Daniel ran on cutting poll taxes and taxes overall, with the idea being to ease pressure on everyday Americans and give them more spending power. Just like in Texas however, this proposal has been met with opposition nationally by other factions of the American Union State. We must reassure them by finding other ways to pay for our programs..." 
TEX_radio_showmanship:0 "Radio Showmanship"
TEX_radio_showmanship_desc:0 "From his early days in the Flour industry, O'Daniel has used the radio to great effect. Through the radio, he has reached a larger audience than ever before, and this audience now clamors to hear his reassuring speeches in even the darkest of days. Even better, O'Daniel has also managed to use his radio following as a political weapon against those who wish to block his agenda."
TEX_reconcile_big_business:0 "Reconcile Big Business"
TEX_reconcile_big_business_desc:0 "Originally, the American Union State did not have much industry, suffering from geography and populist rhetoric that businessmen viewed as being against them. However, O'Daniel believes populism and business can work together, and this is exactly what he plans to do. With more supporters in this community, we can truly compete with our rivals and ensure prosperity after the Civil War."
TEX_labor_agitators:0 "Labor Agitators"
TEX_labor_agitators_desc:0 "The time has come to fight the outsiders who have been brought into our towns and cities to agitate among honest union men.

However, he made the mistake of allowing those in opposition to the Holy American League to remain not only legalized, but within the halls of congress. However, a solution to this problem has finally materialized! By applying pressure via the Knights of Columbus and empowering the right people, we can effectively puppet the opposition. Not only will this give us an even more free hand in our righteous reconstruction of America, but when the people see us working side by side with those who oppose our rule, our popularity among them can only increase, a win-win situation."

However before Britain was completely overtaken by the satanic tendrils of Protestantism, she suffered a horrid Civil War between those who stood for God, King and Country and those evil men who had allowed themselves to be corrupted by Protestantism and the so-called Enlightenment. Those who fought for the King and his attempts to allow the free exercise of The One True Faith overtime adopted the term Cavalier to describe themselves. The Cavalier Identity, one of gentlemanly conduct, standing for God and Country, is an identity that our government must push the American people to adopt. By extolling these men as heroes, not only can we begin the process of creating a true cavalier identity among our people, we can also paint the Canadians and their royalist exiles as usurpers, giving both the American Revolution and our instating of a Monarchy more legitimacy in the eyes of the people."

Al Smith on the other hand has outlined his “Christian Capitalism” plan, which is exactly what it sounds like, this plan has garnered support as well but has been compared to the vile Liberalism that destroyed old America.

With the unions on our side, we can help to rein in haughty corporations and businessmen, and ensure a fair balance between capital and labor, once and for all."
TEX_subsidize_unions:0 "Subsidize Unions"
TEX_subsidize_unions_desc:0 "Unions are paragons of workers rights, and we must not forget this fact. Any man who claims to be an ally of the American worker must support unions. No, we will not support unions who fought for the CSA or others, but we will not shy away from endorsing and funding those unions that have proven their loyalty time and again. With strong unions, the workers of this country will have a strong voice, as they should."
TEX_defend_private_property:0 "Defend Private Property"
TEX_defend_private_property_desc:0 "The principle of private property is one of the founding ideals of this country. All citizens are entitled to privacy within their own property, and though we have enlarged the size of our government, it does not mean we should trample on this fundamental right. Instead, we will make sure that every man is a king, especially on his own land."
TEX_meek_inherit_earth:0 "The Meek Inherit the Earth"
TEX_meek_inherit_earth_desc:0 "The working people of America, a class that could be considered as 'meek' due to their relative poverty, must be defended, according to the Bible. After all, it is the meek that will inherit the earth, and if we secure lands for these groups, we will be all the more righteous. Though the wealthy will complain about their land being taken, they will soon understand that it is for the best of all involved."
TEX_arcadian_america:0 "Arcadian America"
TEX_arcadian_america_desc:0 "The natural beauty of this country, as well as the brilliance of our founding principles and Huey's plans alike, must guide us in this next phase of American life. We will be the envy of the world, as we were always meant to be, and all we had to do was follow the wise guidance of the founders and Huey Long."
TEX_social_justice:0 "Social Justice"
TEX_social_justice_desc:0 "Charles Coughlin has taken power at the head of a popular movement, hoping to implement his plan of 'Social Justice'. For Coughlin, this means a patriotic plan to gain workers rights, reform the currency, and drive out the money changers. He is not a close Long associate, but if can win over enough support with his plans, it will matter little."
TEX_national_sermons:0 "National Sermons"
TEX_national_sermons_desc:0 "Through his old radio speeches, Charles Coughlin gained a massive following. Now that he is in power, something must be done to reassure the people of the administration's success in fighting for them. Coughlin himself is determined to take to the radio, giving speeches on policy and other issues that are more akin to sermons than political oratory, but regardless, we will make our cause all the more popular."
TEX_the_christian_front:0 "The Christian Front"
TEX_the_christian_front_desc:0 "The Christian Front is an association of conservative Longists who have aligned themselves with Charles Coughlin. We must grow this organization, and with the help of Coughlin's newspaper Social Justice, perhaps it will grow to truly massive proportions. Though some whisper that they are more focused on perceived enemies than helping the common man, it is vital that we encourage the growth of The Christian Front. "
TEX_pursue_the_financiers:0 "Pursue the Financiers"
TEX_pursue_the_financiers_desc:0 "Though they tried to cover up their deceit, we know who the true enemies are. The bankers and money changers have swindled our people for too long, and it is time we made a concerted effort to deprive them of their power, once and for all."
TEX_break_financial_slavery:0 "Break Financial Slavery"
TEX_break_financial_slavery_desc:0 "For too long, we have been slaves to those who run our economy. An economy of the American people cannot be owned by a few un-American traitors. With the banks and the national economy now under our power, we are in a position to break the financial slavery we have suffered under for so long, and we can create a truly free America."
TEX_remonetize_silver:0 "Remonetize Silver"
TEX_remonetize_silver_desc:0 "Silver was always a better standard than Gold. William Jennings Bryan knew it, Huey Long knew it, and we know it as well. The first part of Coughlin's economic reforms is to remonetize silver, and therefore allow an increase to the money supply. It is a risky policy, but we must at least try it if we hope to create a new vibrant economy."
TEX_wider_nationalization:0 "Wider Nationalization"
TEX_wider_nationalization_desc:0 "Huey Long's nationalization of industries did not go far enough; we must do more. By nationalizing instutitions such as banks, oil, railroads, and more, we can ensure that our government is never short of the resources it needs to take care of the people. Though some traitors will protest this supposed breach of freedom, we will remind them that they have no right to control the American people, and that we are their true representatives."
TEX_tax_relief_for_poor:0 "Tax Relief for the Poor"
TEX_tax_relief_for_poor_desc:0 "Though we have been somewhat harsh on our wealthier citizens, we must spare the poor from any burdensome policies that might cause a spiral into despair-or death. Instead, we will give tax relief to these downtrodden segments of society, and hopefully this will inspire them towards greater spending and participation in the economy."
TEX_wealth_conscription:0 "Wealth Conscription"
TEX_wealth_conscription_desc:0 "In times of crisis, wealth must be conscripted just as men might be. For those who hoard the wealth and resources of our nation, Coughlin requests only a patriotic share of their vast fortunes. After all, if we are all Americans, we must all contribute equally. If the rich want to weasal out of fighting, they must contribute in other ways."
TEX_simplified_government:0 "Simplified Government"
TEX_simplified_government_desc:0 "Government works best when it is simple. The bloated and inefficient bureaucracy that some called the American government in recent times was an example of what we should not do. Instead, we will streamline government institutions and ensure that government is simple, as any government of, for, and by the people should be."
TEX_liberty_of_conscience:0 "Liberty of Conscience"
TEX_liberty_of_conscience_desc:0 "Among the oldest freedoms in our nation are the ability to practice any religion or follow any avocation in life. The government must not trample on these rights, and through a continued guarantee of them, we can have a true liberty of conscience in America."
TEX_an_unlikely_successor:0 "An Unlikely Successor"
TEX_an_unlikely_successor_desc:0 "Against all odds, we now control the nation, and we now have large shoes to fill. Tough choices must be made; will we follow the path set forth for us by Huey Long, and if so, can we emulate his success with the American people? Only time will tell, but for now, we must create at least a semblance of stability."
TEX_solidify_position:0 "Solidify Our Position"
TEX_solidify_position_desc:0 "Now that we have secured our place as Huey's successor, it is time to stabilize the nation. Though Huey was the 'Imperial President', we have no such legitimacy, and as such, we will seek to create it, one way or another."
TEX_make_voting_machines_sing:0 "Make the Voting Machines Sing"
TEX_make_voting_machines_sing_desc:0 "Those who count the votes in the country are the ones who control the nation in reality. By gaining control over these groups, we will have dominance for decades to come, and our policies and plans will be enshrined in the American psyche."
TEX_honor_huey_long:0 "Honor Huey Long"
TEX_honor_huey_long_desc:0 "The great founder of our new nation, Huey Long, is no longer at the helm of the country. Now that we have succeeded him, we should take care to honor him and further his legacy. More importantly, honoring Huey Long will help us solidify our position as the heirs to the Longist movement, and gain us significant support with our people."
TEX_media_propaganda:0 "Media Propaganda"
TEX_media_propaganda_desc:0 "The newspapers were a critical institution in the old America, having the ability to end political careers on a whim. If we want to maintain power, we must first gain their support. This will happen in a two-fold way: those who are favorable to us will be coerced to support the government agenda, and those who do not will find themselves in a world of pain."
TEX_veterans_bill:0 "Veterans Bill"
TEX_veterans_bill_desc:0 "The veterans who fought for the American Union State must be honored, especially since control over the military is so important to our own power. By passing a landmark 'Veterans Bill', we can guarantee their loyalty for years to come and show the people that we respect those who sacrifice the most for our cause."
TEX_finish_industrialists:0 "Finish the Industrialists"
TEX_finish_industrialists_desc:0 "The overmighty industrialists who once ruled this nation are on the run, and we must finish them off. No longer will they have undue influence over America; while they can still exist, they will never dominate the government again. By sweeping the rug from under them, the industrialists, loyal or not, will no longer have the power to control our economy, and all Americans will be better off."
TEX_eliminate_poverty:0 "Eliminate Poverty"
TEX_eliminate_poverty_desc:0 "Poverty is like a plague on American life. For our existence, it has been unrelenting, always creeping into the lives of our poorest citizens. This will no longer be the case, and with careful measures to ensure an end to staggering wealth inequality, we will finally wipe out this disease."
TEX_democratic_transition:0 "Democratic Transition"
TEX_democratic_transition_desc:0 "Now that Huey Long is gone, we must continue his work of reforming the country and establishing a healthy democracy. One hurdle to this will be in deciding how we will lead the AFP moving forward, and what policies we pursue. Regardless, however, all Americans can rest easy in the knowledge that their government will now work for them."
TEX_honest_government:0 "Honest Government"
TEX_honest_government_desc:0 "One of the biggest factors that drove the nation to civil war was a lack of trust in the corrupt government. The people were right to be wary; the government was, after all, taking advantage of them and serving only a small group of interests. Now, we will ensure that the government can be held accountable to those it is meant to serve: the people."
TEX_rural_schools:0 "Rural Schools"
TEX_rural_schools_desc:0 "Huey Long planned to invest more in new schools, especially for the rural areas that need them so badly, after the war. However, now that we are in power, we must bring this plan to fruition. By building better primary schools and perhaps even universities in the rural areas of our nation, we can better educate the next generation, and also help those areas recover."
TEX_chicago_plan:0 "The Chicago Plan"
TEX_chicago_plan_desc:0 "The Chicago Plan was originally drafted by the University of Chicago, and endorsed by AFP politician Bronson Cutting. The plan would see banks separate their monetary and credit functions, creating a full-reserve banking system. In practice, this would make it so that banks have enough money to cover their loans. Further, as Irving Fisher has put it, it would "nationalize money, but not banking"."
TEX_new_american_family:0 "The New American Family"
TEX_new_american_family_desc:0 "A task we must pursue if we want to create prosperity in America is supporting our families. The American family has been devastated in the past twenty years, and if we are successful in promoting their growth once more, we will have a growing population-and a larger pool of manpower to draw from."
TEX_currency_reform:0 "Currency Reform"
TEX_currency_reform_desc:0 "Huey Long understood that the currency needed some sort of reform if it were to function efficienctly and fairly. We will act on this issue and make sure it is not the incompetent banks who handle this part of the economy, but us, and that perhaps a silver currency will be adopted rather than a gold one."
TEX_roll_back_censorship:0 "Roll Back Censorship"
TEX_roll_back_censorship_desc:0 "During the Civil War, Huey Long instituted certain policies of censorship on media and other institutions that were understandable at the time, but must now be rolled back. To have the newspapers on our side, we should show them that we will give them plenty of space to conduct their business as they see fit. With freedom of the press reinstated, we are one step closer to creating a new America."
TEX_reconcile_the_church:0 "Reconcile the Church"
TEX_reconcile_the_church_desc:0 "It is well known that Huey Long did not have the best relationship with churches, despite the best efforts of men like Gerald K. Smith and Charles Coughlin. Regardless, now that we are in power, we should make an effort to extend an olive branch to these organizations. We should not hope for direct endorsements, but if we can get them to sympathize with us at least, it will show that we truly are good Americans and only wish to bring some semblance of morality back to America."
TEX_a_virtuous_republic:0 "A Virtuous Republic"
TEX_a_virtuous_republic_desc:0 "A republic free of corruption is what the people call out for, and it is what they deserve. After the herculean effort of millions of brave AFP fighters, we stand ready to move forward as a new nation, inspired by the vision of Huey Long and with a government that serves the people."
TEX_the_people_yes:0 "The People, Yes"
TEX_the_people_yes_desc:0 "The populist vision for America, in which the hard-working common man is able to make a good living for himself and his family and all share in the prosperity of the nation, has finally come to fruition. We have brought changes into a world resenting change, and now, the tough will of the American people has paid off."
TEX_uncle_earl:0 "Uncle Earl"
TEX_uncle_earl_desc:0 "Earl Long, the estranged brother of the legendary Huey Long, has come to power, succeeding his brother and continuing what some are calling the Long Dynasty. Despite his familial ties to Huey, Earl has a lot to prove, and even if he does prove a worthy successor to Huey, he must make a choice: will he follow in Huey's footsteps, or implement his own vision for the country?"
TEX_fulfill_his_vision:0 "Fulfill His Vision"
TEX_fulfill_his_vision_desc:0 "Earl Long has decided that he must continue the work of his brother, a man he often agreed with, despite their tendency to argue with one another. In establishing what some are calling a "Long Dynasty", Earl has reassured worried onlookers that he hopes to finish Huey's plans and govern for as long as the people wish, though just how long that will be is yet to be seen."
TEX_world_class_highways:0 "World-Class Highways"
TEX_world_class_highways_desc:0 "Part of Earl Long's program to bring the country back from economic ruin is the building of a new national highway system. Plans for such a system have been in the works for years, but now we have the resources to finally make good on our promises. This will allow us to connect our vast nation like never before."
TEX_retail_taxes:0 "Retail Taxes"
TEX_retail_taxes_desc:0 "Earl Long is a practical man, and he understands that to pay for Huey's programs, we must implement higher taxation in some cases. For this purpose, it is proposed that a retail tax, as well as small taxes on gas, beer, and more, would give more than enough for these programs. It may be unpopular, but it will allow us more funding for important advances in research as well as our domestic programs for the people."
TEX_louisiana_politicking:0 "Louisiana Politicking"
TEX_louisiana_politicking_desc:0 "Despite seeing himself as Huey's natural heir, Earl Long still has many enemies. To eliminate or otherwise undermine these rivals, he wishes to engage in a what he calls "a little Louisiana politicking". This will involve challenging rivals with favorable candidates, denying party financial support to naysayers, and using the bully pulpit to keep dissenting politicians in line. Earl Long is a master at such strategies, and through his crafty maneuvering, we will have a stable AFP."
TEX_end_civil_service:0 "End the Civil Service" 
TEX_end_civil_service_desc:0 "The Civil Service makes life difficult for Earl Long. How could he accomplish his goals if he cannot fund the politicians responsibe for voting? Instead of this system, we will encourage patronage, given by Earl Long chiefly but by allies as well, which will allow us greater control over politicians nationwide. Though some decry this as a blatantly tyrannical move, Earl has swatted such criticisms aside, noting that the politicians deserve it anyways."
TEX_the_earl_of_louisiana:0 "The Earl of Louisiana"
TEX_the_earl_of_louisiana_desc:0 "As the master of a resurgent America, Earl Long has achieved a status on par with his brother. His towering figure and warm charisma have led some to dub him the 'Earl of Louisiana', given his seemingly unshakable grip on the nation's government. For better or worse, Earl Long is firmly in the saddle."
TEX_distract_public:0 "Distract the Public"
TEX_distract_public_desc:0 "The public is a fickle thing, and if we want their support, we have to give them distractions. Like the Roman saying of 'bread and circuses', we will ensure our people are focused on entertainment and other things so that we have free reign to implement our plans. Further, through rousing speeches, Earl Long himself will have the people in his hands, and this will surely enhance his popularity."
TEX_secure_the_long_machine:0 "Secure the Long Machine"
TEX_secure_the_long_machine_desc:0 "Huey Long's machine was never opened to Earl Long before the Civil War, and it is something that Earl bitterly remembers. Now that he is in power though, we must seize the machine for ourselves, to help ensure we maintain power for as long as we need to and to ensure nobody else gets their hands on it. Though he had to wait his turn, Earl Long can finally take his rightful place at the head of the Long family and its powerful political machine."
TEX_plenty_of_snap_in_my_garters:0 "Plenty of Snap in my Garters"
TEX_plenty_of_snap_in_my_garters_desc:0 "Given his smaller reputation and tendency to spend time with the downtrodden rather than Huey's old practice of dividing his time among all economic classes, some have said Earl is unworthy to succeed Huey Long. Some even say that Earl lacks the vision or ambition that his brother had. For those in doubt, though, Earl Long only has one thing to say: "I've got plenty of snap left in my garters!"."
TEX_charm_the_people:0 "Charm the People"
TEX_charm_the_people_desc:0 "An Earl Long speech is not an event, it is an experience. Crowds of tens of thousands come to see his colorful oratory and his humorous anecdotes, and though his speeches are not very policy-focused, the people love them anyways. Through barnstorming the country and doing his beloved work of connecting with common people, Earl will win them over to his cause."
TEX_three_ps:0 "The Three P's"
TEX_three_ps_desc:0 "Politicking, Plain People, and Pea Patch Farm; these are the things most important to Earl Long. A mastermind political actor as well as a lover of farmers and other average workers, Earl Long would much rather spend his time with voters and supporters on his farm than engage with perfumed politicians in an office. Though he has ambitious plans to reform the nation even now, sometimes it is best to enjoy the simpler things."
TEX_a_new_direction:0 "A New Direction"
TEX_a_new_direction_desc:0 "Rather than closely following his brother's plans, Earl Long has decided to move forward with his own plan of reforms. Though it is similar in many ways to Huey's vision, Earl notes that his plan takes a firm stance on race, and does more to engage with the working people of America. After all, what better way is there to win new voters?"
TEX_black_enfranchisement:0 "Black Enfranchisement"
TEX_black_enfranchisement_desc:0 "The issue of the Black vote has been a taboo in the South for decades, but now that the Civil War is over and Earl Long is in control, it must be readressed. We will ensure that people of all races, especially Blacks, will be able to vote if they choose to do so, and hopefully, they will choose to vote for us in gratitude."
TEX_feed_the_hungry:0 "Feed the Hungry"
TEX_feed_the_hungry_desc:0 "Though blatant starvation is rare in America, there is still a large part of the population that is underfed, particularly children. By ensuring that workers have the money they need to feed their families and that children have access to free lunches at school, we can ensure our people focus on other matters besides their growling stomachs."
TEX_equal_teachers_pay:0 "Equal Teachers Pay"
TEX_equal_teachers_pay_desc:0 "America's teachers have received dismal treatment as of late, and they have never been paid as much as they are worth. Never one to turn away a possible vote, Earl Long has decided that it is necessary to increase teacher's salaries, and ensure that there is no discrimination on the basis of gender. Experienced teachers will be paid more, but with this discrimination largely out of the way, our families will do better as a whole."
TEX_modern_hospitals:0 "Modern Hospitals"
TEX_modern_hospitals_desc:0 "Our hospitals are in need of modern equipment and technology, and Earl Long is happy to provide whatever they need. Modernizing urban hospitals, building new ones in rural areas, and overall ensuring that the sick always have somewhere they can be taken care of, Earl hopes that we can take care of all our veterans and anyone else harmed by the Civil War. We will take care of our people, and they will take care of us."
TEX_rock_em_sock_em:0 "Rock 'Em Sock 'Em"
TEX_rock_em_sock_em_desc:0 "Uncle Earl is seen by many to be a tireless man, but when questioned on his superhuman stamina, he merely stated that he engages in "Rock 'Em, Sock 'Em" politics, and stated that if his rivals didn't like it, they should go somewhere else. His criss-crossing of the country has made him a star in the eyes of millions, and his engaging and often humorous speeches are more popular than ever."
TEX_american_radicalism:0 "American Radicalism"
TEX_american_radicalism_desc:0 "The oddball Alfred Bingham and his movement for American Radicalism have taken power in the country. Though they do not follow Huey Long's agenda closely, they purport to be his intellectual successors, and insist that their policies will fulfill his goals. The middle-class radical hopes to win over the American people, but first he must decide what policies are most important to him."
TEX_the_middle_class_mind:0 "The Middle Class Mind"
TEX_the_middle_class_mind_desc:0 "To create a revolution in a bourgeois nation, we must engage with the middle class mind. The middle class is ready for a classless society, and Bingham believes the average American does more to act like someone in a commune than a rugged individualist. By tailoring our rhetoric to this class, making sure we do not offend their wealtheir sensibilities, we can create something truly revolutionary in the nation."
TEX_tactical_realism:0 "Tactical Realism"
TEX_tactical_realism_desc:0 "To bring the American people to our side, we must make small changes to the economy. This way, few will be upset at what are largely seen as modest reforms, though they will be a complete overhaul of the economy over time. One step at a time, we will chip away at the old system, as Huey Long did, and create a new, better economy."
TEX_outflank_capitalism:0 "Outflank Capitalism"
TEX_outflank_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism is still popular with a majority of Americans, and to undermine it, we should demonstrate its dysfunction as a system. To do this, we will repurpose old factories and take over a vertical cross-section of the economy, operating it on the production-for-use basis rather than the old profit system. This is merely a test, but we believe the people will react well to it."
TEX_lure_them_in:0 "Lure Them In"
TEX_lure_them_in_desc:0 "We are not deaf to the concerns of the American people. Though they are concerned about economics, they yearn for patriotic appeals too, and if we hope to keep their support, we must take advantage of this. By painting our movement as uniquely American in nature and rousing up feelings of nationalism, we can speed up our reforms and prevent other rival groups from using that rhetoric for their own purposes."
TEX_socialist_efficiency:0 "Socialist Efficiency"
TEX_socialist_efficiency_desc:0 "Now that we have begun the reformation of the economy, it is time to show the American people that the socialist system we envision is more efficient. We will slowly but surely transition our economy to a socialist model, nationalizing major industries and outflanking the old industrialist class."
TEX_society_of_plenty:0 "Society of Plenty"
TEX_society_of_plenty_desc:0 "America is a nation of vast resources, and yet until recently, they were concentrated in the hands of a few. Now, there will be a more equal distribution, and in a new society of plenty, all will prosper. No longer will our resources be thrown away for profit motives; we will use them in the interests of the everyday American, and we shall be the powerhouse we were always meant to be."
TEX_common_sense:0 "Common Sense"
TEX_common_sense_desc:0 "Drawing on the rhetoric of Thomas Paine and other American thinkers, Alfred Bingham created the monthly journal of the same name. Now that he is in power, Common Sense has become the most popular journal in the country, and Bingham has decided to use it to help promote his ideas to those who have never considered them before. With crucial media support, we can continue advancing towards a new nation."
TEX_insurgent_americans:0 "Insurgent Americans"
TEX_insurgent_americans_desc:0 "In a recent book by Alfred Bingham, in which he dubbed the American people as 'insurgent Americans', it was said that the American people cry out for change. It is true, and with Bingham as their leader, the American people will finally get a more equitable system, a system in which fairness rules the day and greed has been driven from our shores. America has risen up!"
TEX_rehabilitate_leftist_radicals:0 "Rehabilitate Leftist Radicals"
TEX_rehabilitate_leftist_radicals_desc:0 "Bingham understands that our movement pales in comparison to the likes of Huey Long's following, and so, we should make some attempt to rehabilitate leftist radicals from other Civil War factions. From Upton Sinclair to Thomas Dewey, we will do our best to help these fellow radicals understand that we are not their enemies, and in some cases, we will reunite with long-lost allies to build a larger socialist movement than ever."
TEX_peace_in_the_west:0 "Peace in the West"
TEX_peace_in_the_west_desc:0 "On the West Coast, Upton Sinclair's EPIC plan is still a commonly known proposal in the minds of many. It has relevance for us too, for the EPIC plan inspired much of Bingham's own policies, particularly in attacking capitalism by outflanking it, rather than fighting it directly. With the hopes that we can charm Sinclair to our side, we will be able to win another portion of America's radicals to our side."
TEX_assimilate_the_bellamyists:0 "Assimilate the Bellamyists"
TEX_assimilate_the_bellamyists_desc:0 "The Bellamyists in the CSA were our allies; though they sided with a different faction, this was done to attempt to influence as many sides as possible. Now that the country is united once more, we should reunite with the likes of Thomas Dewey, who is an old friend of Bingham's. It is likely that they could be persuaded to join us, and with them on our side, we will be all the more stronger."
TEX_production_for_use:0 "Production for Use"
TEX_production_for_use_desc:0 "For centuries, America has operated on a production for profit system. Resources have been wasted, the people have suffered, and all of it for what, a Civil War? Bingham has a new vision, a vision of a society in which products are made on the basis of use, not profit, and in doing so, we will create a more just and equitable society. We will create a simultaneously more efficient and humane economy that takes care of all Americans, and we will be the envy of the world."
TEX_national_insurance_system:0 "National Insurance System"
TEX_national_insurance_system_desc:0 "In continuing Huey Long's reforms and pushing for his own, Bingham has decided that a national insurance system is needed. For example, this will guarantee that any American can go to a hospital if they are sick and injured, and show the world that a country that takes care of its people will be a prosperous one. The mafia-like insurance companies will never terrorize Americans again!"
TEX_abolish_speculation:0 "Abolish Speculation"
TEX_abolish_speculation_desc:0 "The damaging practice of speculation, once done in banks and financial institutions all over America, must end. We cannot allow banks to play with people's money; instead, they should focus on their other responsabilities, as they always should have."
TEX_solidify_public_ownership:0 "Solidify Public Ownership"
TEX_solidify_public_ownership_desc:0 "The national ownership of public utilities such as water, electricity, railroads, and more, must be assured. By finishing what Huey started in giving the ownership of these tools to the people, we will create a nation in which profit is not the driving force. Through this, we will continue on the road to a truly production-for-use society."
TEX_technology_and_technocracy:0 "Technology and Technocracy"
TEX_technology_and_technocracy_desc:0 "Though Bingham is not purely a technocrat, he does admit that they have certain useful ideas. The ideals of a futuristic nation in which experts can run the government are appealing, and we should seek to promote the type of world envisioned by thinkers such as Edward Bellamy, among others."
TEX_true_democracy:0 "True Democracy"
TEX_true_democracy_desc:0 "Now that we have created a nation that is not only politically democratic, but democratic in the workplace and the economy overall, we can finally say with pride that we live in a democratic nation. It is not the old false democracy of capitalism, but instead, a comprehensive democratic system, in which all people can take part."
TEX_visionary_from_prospect_hill:0 "The Visionary from Prospect Hill"
TEX_visionary_from_prospect_hill_desc:0 "From his beginnings in Prospect Hill, Alfred Bingham has had a long and harrowing journey. Influeneced by mostly American thought, as well as some foreign thought, he has created an America that he is proud of, an America in which a middle class revolution has manifested. Finally, we can move forward as a classless society and enjoy prosperity for years to come."

### Reconstruction ###
TEX_rebuilding_the_country:0 "Rebuilding the Country"
TEX_rebuilding_the_country_desc:0 "A long struggle to push through the Federalist, Syndicalist, and ODP forces in America has left the victorious Union State economically drained. The hand that unifies the country can either promote a deficit spending regime, or an austere policy that limits direct intervention in the market."
TEX_national_recovery:0 "National Recovery Administration"
TEX_national_recovery_desc:0 "The NRA emphasizes the use of public domain and work-living units instead of 'cut throat competition' of regular contract work. Workers in the NRA will receive the benefit of a minimum wages and price-controlled work environments in constant to the old Company Store model."
TEX_public_works:0 "Public Works Administration"
TEX_public_works_desc:0 "The ability to generate electricity, transport water, and ensure safe and efficient travel was lost during the civil war. However, the Public Works Administration will fix all that. It is a fund that will ensure contractors pay their employees fairly, so that their are better incentivized to help rebuild."
TEX_research_projects:0 "National Education Administration"
TEX_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members have dispersed. With most teachers being apolitical and the union never being able to exert much partisan power over them, it is a strong candidate for rehabilitation by the new American government."
TEX_civil_works_adminstration:0 "National Public Works"
TEX_civil_works_adminstration_desc:0 "As a nation, America lost a great deal of its labor supply to the fighting and poverty of recent years.

TEX_rural_electrification:0 "Rural Electrification"
TEX_rural_electrification_desc:0 "The electricity network throughout the country has regressed to that of the 1910s. This is un-American and we need to ensure that our constituents can be properly informed about our nation's glory. Further, electrification will give our rural areas access to much "

TEX_the_aaa_desc:0 "Farms are the basis of the American economy, but they have seen devestation wrought from the Civil War.

TEX_farm_security_administration:0 "Farm Securities Act"
TEX_farm_security_administration_desc:0 "Sharecroppers and tenant farmers make up a significant portion of our constituency, especially in the core of the South and the Great Plains.

TEX_reconstruction_is_over_desc:0 "The course of reconstruction has revealed the true ideological basis for why Hoover was unable to fix the economy.

TEX_recognize_philantrophers_desc:0 "While many members of the wealthy opposed the AUS' efforts to redistribute goods, even within a capitalist economy, there are some who remained neutral in this debate.

TEX_Grand_Army_of_the_Republic_desc:0 "An organization from the first American Civil War intended to represent veterans, the organization is on its last legs due to few veterans still surviving.

TEX_dependent_and_disability_act_desc:0 "Based on an older Civil War Act, the GAR is pushing for us to revive the Dependent and Disability Act which would provide Federal pension aid for disabled veterans and widows of dead veterans.

TEX_From_a_Militia_to_a_force_desc:0 "So far, the only forces the Kingfish has commanded have been small-time militias in urban enviroments. With the advent of the civil war, many generals and army groups have 'deserted' to join the real American government, and adapating our previous forces and hierarchy to these newcomers should be our priority."
TEX_improve_artillery:0 "Improve our Artillery"

TEX_focus_on_concentration:0 "Focus on Fire Concentration"
TEX_focus_on_concentration_desc:0 "Force Concentration has been an invaluable tactic for every commander since the times of the Roman Legions. Given our nation's limited resources when fighting against the traitors of America, we should once again reconsider this strategy for our artillery, concentrating it on specific sectors to achieve breakthroughs for our infantry to take advantage of."
AUS_focus_on_swiftness:0 "Focus on Swiftness"
AUS_focus_on_swiftness_desc:0 "Modern Warfare has come a long way since the trenches that once plagued the Western Front. Fast advances with tanks followed by motorized units is now not a dream, but a necesity of a successful fighting force. As such, our nation's army should be at the forefront of this development."
TEX_focus_on_command:0 "Focus on Command"
TEX_focus_on_command_desc:0 "Our enemies in the civil war can be described simply as disorganized and demoralized militias with occassional remnants of the former Army presenting any real resistance. If we wish to prevail against them, then we should make our own own army an example of strong organization and cohesion."

TEX_army_bonus_bill:0 "Army Bonus Bill"
TEX_army_bonus_bill_desc:0 "Combat hardens boys into men and men into solid steel - unshakeable pillars of Americanism. Only a fool would leave veterans such as these by the wayside.

TEX_independent_command_style:0 "Cavalry Reconnaissance"

TEX_minutemen_professionalism:0 "Professionalize the Minutemen"
TEX_minutemen_professionalism_desc:0 "The Minutemen can not hope to fend off the enemy if they are going to remain ragtag auxillaries of the AFP.

TEX_back_in_business_desc:0 "Now that our position as a world power has been restored to us, it is time to figure out where we fit into the scheme of things. Most of our politicians, and people, are urging us towards isolationism. This would be simple, as it would mostly continue the foreign policy America had before the war. However, every isolationist is different, and some say it would be wise to seek allies in this changing world."
TEX_americanist_doctrine:0 "Americanist Doctrine"
TEX_americanist_doctrine_desc:0 "It would not serve us to isolate ourselves, as we have been in the past. At the same time, we will not play second fiddle to some other power.

TEX_popular_monroeism:0 "Review Monroeism"
TEX_popular_monroeism_desc:0 "During the Second Civil War, we largely abandoned our Monroe Doctrine obligations. Facing new threats, the countries of Latin America have turned inward, or to one another, for protection. We should pursue a new Monroe Doctrine, motivated not by greed, but by brotherhood. We are all Americans in a sense, and we will never suffer colonizers again!"
TEX_populist_alliance:0 "Populist Alliance"
TEX_populist_alliance_desc:0 "The old model of exploitation has been thrown out. Instead, we should win nations over with diplomacy, economic arrangements, and military protection.

TEX_align_nationalists_desc:0 "We should align ourselves with those who share our belief in nationalism.

unionstate.1.d:0 "With the end of the civil war comes a vacancy in the ever important position of the American Legion's National Commander. This last title holder, Smedley Butler, had foolishly sided with the syndicalists. Whomever taken this position will symbolically represent the veterans of the United States military in society, and thus our choice is important. The most common name floated up is General Terry de la Mesa Allen Jr, although he would need to pressured into the position given his hatred of bureaucracy. Right-wing Populists argue that Gerald L.K. Smith should be given the position, as a show of his loyalty and activism in Legion recruitment. Left-wing Populists on the other hand seem to prefer veteran Sid McMath. Who shall be appointed?"

unionstate.11.d:0 "The years of service to America has worn Father Charles Coughlin down. In between his radio shows and his Social Justice publications, he rarely has time to promote Share Our Wealth Societies. This coupled with his increasing emotional instability has led to this day. President [TEX.GetLeader], while silent on this issue, sympathizes with the Jewish citizens for whom Coughlin has flirted with demonizing as he walks the line on lumping them in with international bankers. We must retire Coughlin, but who should replace him? The calmer preacher Billy Graham? Huey's old running mate William Lemke? Or up-and-coming Longist Rush Holt Sr.?"

In this time of uncertainty where anybody could be an assassin, should Huey's family occupy the vital positions in the Presidential Cabinet? It is a stretch in confidence for all but the most determined Longists to accept family into the high posts of government."

unionstate.13.t:0 "Improve the Southern Tenant Farmers Union"
unionstate.13.d:0 "Although the work of the Southern Tenant Farmers Union is well appreciated, the name itself that provides homes to thousands is still the butt of jokes. The tenants are exasperated about the name of their organization. A visit to the office and a reprint is all it takes to correct that snafu. While [TEX.GetLeader] was inside, he decided to improve and integrate other parts of the newly christened American Tenant Farmers Union into his political machine."

unionstate.14.t:0 "The Truth about Hugo Black"
unionstate.14.d:0 "When the Honorable Hugo Black was appointed office on the coattails of Huey Long's victory, very few had bothered to check his past associations. This is why today's newspaper shocked President [TEX.GetLeader] so greatly. An expose found Hugo Black's Klan membership. Hugo Black responded to the press by profusely apologizing, and saying that his membership was just perfunctory in order to get elected in Alabama. While Black's judicial record does paint him as a liberal, this flies directly in the face of Long's anti-Klan campaign. Should we fire Hugo Black?"

unionstate.15.t:0 "Schism in Share Our Wealth Societies"
unionstate.15.d:0 "To Share Our Wealth societies throughout America, [TEX.GetLeader] has enlisted not only party members but also former government employees. These new employees were directed by William Lemke, and were paid on the federal payroll. Now there exists a tension between the old and the new in Share Our Wealth. Old guard leader Francis Townsend advocates for Share Our Wealth to remain a non-governmental entity to prevent partisan politics, while Lemke wishes to officiate it as a Federal Department."

unionstate.16.d:0 "A tale of greed and betrayal that once littered America is now encapsulated in the new film McTeague. A social commentary by director Erich von Stroheim about the corrupting power of wealth is seen by many as a parable to the state of America before the Civil War. This massive four-hour epic film had it's ending altered from the original book, where a kind stranger intervenes in the death struggle of McTeague and whisks him away from Death Valley back to civilisation."

unionstate.19.d:0 "Governor Earl Long has long dodged accusations of corruption and mismanagement of money. As the brother of President Huey Long, Earl has been immune from prosecution and is usually handled delicately by the press. Earl's administeration has been charged to distribute veteran benefits and basic income to the people of Louisiana, with the assumption that all loyal Americans would be deserving of this welfare. A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Norther Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capital, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control. The press are not quite at a fever pitch, and any move Huey does could swing public opinion at the moment. "

unionstate.20.d:0 "The imaginations and political opinions of Americans were piqued when Black No More, written by author George Schuyler, appeared on bookshelves. The book is a science fiction about a scientist who invents a machine that can turn a black man white. This invention turns society upside down, and challenges ideas on race and the one drop principle. The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that President [TEX.GetLeader] enjoys the book."

However, he is not content with this outcome, and he has begun to campaign on the national stage. O'Daniel hopes to bring his populist message and conservative economic policies to all Americans, and though he is officially a Democrat, he has deviated from traditional Democratic messaging and campaigning in his embrace of some of Huey Long's rhetoric. His campaign, drawing from his radio audience and traditional Democrat voters overall, has quickly amassed support nationwide, and O'Daniel threatens to overshadow Long as the man Americans look up to for guidance. His charisma should not be underestimated, and perhaps we should take Texas more seriously to try and shut him up."

unionstate.22.t:0 "Formation of the Christian Party"
unionstate.22.d:0 "With the growth of the Silver Legion under William Dudley Pelley and the announcement of the election, the Christian Party has announced it will stand at the next elections. Eating into the support of the right-wing of the AFP and the now rump Democratic Party, the Christian Party is running on a protestant Christian Democratic platform with progressive economic policies including wealth dividends and full employment. Perhaps we should pander to our right-wing so as to stop their support?"

unionstate.27.d:0 "While crime in rampant throughout the territory as criminals look to make a easy buck from the unstable nature of America one criminal group in particular has gained infamy, namely the Barrow gang. This is largely due to the sensationalist takes on Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker, a couple apparently leading the gang and whom are often called Bonnie and Clyde for short. The activities of the whole gang involve mainly robberies sometimes even of banks, but increasingly members of law enforcement are getting gunned down, partly due to the heavy firepower the gang is packing. Famously Clyde Barrow himself carries a Browning Automatic Rifle. Unfortunately the gang is gaining an undeserved folksy reputation and undermining the legitimacy of the state, how should we respond?"

Nonetheless, he is not very welcoming towards the Constitutional American Republic whom hope to displace him and his system with the Old Democrats and other more hardcore white supremacists and prohibitionists whom view Pendergast as a seller of vice which in all honesty he is. Certainly this does not make him the greater evil to us nor are we to him, leading to him asking for protection. His machine would undermine the AFP power and not be wholly popular but would provide the AUS as a whole with greater resources, men who could be recruited in his territory and assistance from Pendergast's organized crime allies who could make our lives easier and CAR's more difficult. On the other hand we could just run AFP candidates in his territory and scare off him and his ally mobster Charles Carrollo by threatening to charge them should they not leave. What should we do?"

unionstate.29.d:0 "The Southern Tenant Farmers Union is a left-wing bureau for tenant farmers legally operating within our territory and supporting the American Union State over the rightist Constitutional American Republic, whom are repressing the STFU in their territory. This makes them potentially useful allies as they can help disrupt activities within the CAR if provided funding and perhaps even giving its leader Harry Leland Mitchell a seat on our cabinet. However, some in the party are reluctant to do so due to it being widely known the STFU has heavy sympathies with some of the Combined Syndicates of America despite not being based out of their territory. Providing support will surely help us shore up support but nonetheless would increase socialist sympathies and anger social conservatives who dislike the STFU's progressive stance on race issues."

unionstate.30.d:0 "Huey's main ally in Congress and now in the AUS has long been the Midwest Progressive and Farmer-Labor organizations despite an occasionally tense relationship due to disagreements with Long's style of populism and alleged demagoguery. However a recent proposal would strengthen this alliance. It comes from Alfred Mitchell Bingham, a radical activist and lead editor of the periodical Common Sense, is supportive of progressivism, the AFP and the right-wing of the CSA and is responsible for running the American Farmer-Labor Federation. The AFLF is made up of middle-class activists organizing mainly for the working class and which has connections with the AFP, the Progressives and even Bellaymists in the CSA. Despite the Federations flexibility it's stance on economic issues revolves around economic planning when it comes to agrarian goods and recently Bingham and other members of the Federation have begun to see the AFP as the best possible route to a radical but patriotic future. They have proposed forming the American Commonwealth Co-operative Movement, under which they would openly join the AFP in a political alliance. While this would shore up our support among left-leaning activists and undermine the National Progressive Party has potential competition it could tie us to more left-wing economic policies than some of our party members are comfortable with."

unionstate.3001.t:0 "Second Great Migration"
unionstate.3001.d:0 "Despite the attempts of the Constitutional American Republic to force black Americans to stay in their territory, an increasingly large number of Black Americans are fleeing to the North and West. The total is likely numbering in at least a million, with many seeking to settle in our territory due to its obvious proximity. In particular, the urban regions of Texas are seeing an inflow of Black migrants but the machines representing many whites, particularly the questionably loyal local Democratic Parties as well as part of the AFP, are demanding we take away their right to vote so as to not threaten their political supremacy. White populists such as Gerald L.K. Smith suggest also stopping anymore blacks from entering so as to not threaten the white working class. However, much of the AFP and Progressives disagree with this and alongside our generals see an opportunity for recruitment and potential factory workers. They recommend allowing the migrants to settle and recruiting them at once."
unionstate.3001.a:0 "Let them in"

unionstate.3002.d:0 "The Regular Democratic Organization is Louisian's political machine for conservative Democrats and are Long's traditional opponents in his home state. Despite this the two have made alliances in the past and with the "Old Regulars" having questionable loyalty to the AUS over CAR or the USA now might be the time to make another such alliance, agreeing not to run AFP candidates in Southern Louisiana in return for them not openly opposing us. Of course, some Old Regulars have already crossed over to the Old Democrats and refuse to support Long, begging the question of whether we should simply "investigate" the organization for corruption and have it basically shut down which would also increase the AFP's hold on the state. Of course, this would push the old money elite even more against Long as well as the most ardent white supremacists."

unionstate.3003.t:0 "Black Troop Debate!"
unionstate.3003.d:0 "The question of black combat troops has long been a contentious one in the United States, with race traditionalists insisting that blacks lack the intellectual faculties to be combat troops whereas others insist this is an absurd position and simply robs us of much needed soldiers. Currently Gerald L.K. Smith leads the charge on behalf of race traditionalists, insisting that blacks can not be expected to be soldiers and gain the same benefits as white soldiers. Charles Coughlin and much the Silver Legion are in accordance with this, although Pelley himself is ambivalent about letting Northern Blacks join as combat troops. He is a hardliner when it comes to Southern Blacks, insisting they lack the 'intelligence and civility' to be troops. On the other side, Jacob Devers, the AFP machine in Louisiana and the Radicals in the AUS such as the Non-Partisan League, have pushed for black combat troops, admonishing the traditionalists for wanting to choose defeat just to spite blacks. They insist we should have Devers lead a recruitment campaign."

unionstate.3004.d:0 "While the state of Minnesota is in the control of the farmer-labor party, there remains a strong IWW element within Minneapolis whom have grown increasingly unstable since former governor Floyd Olson, whom held amicable relations with them, died. Now they are clearly desiring to join the CSA, and putting down their strikes would not only antagonize the socialists but cost us some manpower. Either we will have to pay them off or send national guard to quell them. Of course, some radicals in the AFP would prefer to just give them semi-autonomy in Minneapolis, allowing them to run it along more syndicalist lines so long as they do not attack members of the middle and upper class living there, and instead we will pay off business owners. They claim this will quell their anger altogether."

unionstate.3005.d:0 "For conservatives who are dissapointed in the Democratic Party for their lack of populist credentials compared to other factions but who are also turned off by the AFP's and NPP's progressivism, the Silver Legion's mix of conservatism and wealth redistribution has become an increasingly attractive alternative. The Democrats are becoming increasingly unpopular among the farmers and 'legacy' democrats who supported them before and are increasingly a party of tradesmen and some middle-class iberals based largely out of Texas."

unionstate.3006.t:0 "Leander Perez Controversy!"
unionstate.3006.d:0 "Leander Perez is an openly corrupt judge, hardline segregationalist and political boss operating out of Louisiana whom has made an alliance of pragmatism with Huey Long. Recently he has found himself in a controversy as journalists working for our political opponents have discovered his mishandling of oil leases under his watch, handing out contracts for bribes or to companies he ownes. Perez is a powerful ally but his handling of the oil contracts is forcing us to take a stand on this. Of course, this could be an opportunity to get rid of Perez, especially since in the future he will likely cause problems if we stray from his vision."

unionstate.3008.t:0 "Leander Perez Kidnapped!"
unionstate.3008.d:0 "Leander Perez has recently disappeared after a falling out with Huey Long. According to reports, the fight was over his position as district attorney within Louisiana and his diversion of funds Long wanted to fund the war effort. He was apparently ambushed exiting a courthouse and entering his car, after which whomever was already in the car and the driver kidnapped him. Why his bodyguards did not intervene is unknown but while Long has blamed the dissappearance on socialists most don't doubt that Perez is in a swamp somewhere. With an example made, we could allow the machine he set up to go back to its usual business or we could appoint one of our own, which may be useful if we do not plan to follow the right-wing agenda of the Perez machine, with Cat Doucet being floated as an AFP representative who can take the plce of Perez and reform his machine to be more in-line with our values."

Their gambled failed however, and while they have fled the nation we have taken control of their businesses left here in the states. For the large stockholders, we will have to decide if we should wholly take control of these businesses, and sell them to someone new, or allow them to retake control under new corporate leadership so long as they pay fines."

The Black Legion has decied this as a war crime, claiming that Effinger was not only given no chance to surrender but that Black Legion watchmen were killed before they could issue a warning, meaning the Minutemen had no intention of giving them a chance to surrender. However the operation is being celebrated across America and Ranger Manuel T.

There is Richard Russell Jr, who was a known moderate during the war and one of the more reluctant members of CAR, openly hoping they would shift closer to the center, however he is somewhat too socially conservative for many. Then there is James Eastland, who is more hardline on race issues but far more open to Long's economic agenda. Finally, we could pull some strings to place Earl Long in charge of the region."

With an opening with the actual Huey Long endorsing the film and wishing all Americans well, critics claim that the film being funded by the AFP makes it little more than a piece of government propaganda.

Congress is another issue however, and some AFP members claim legitimate opposition should be allowed to exist there and in the Supreme Court. The Protect America Act put forward by hardliners and backed by the Louisiana machine and Townsend would effectively give the president full legislative and judicial power, and all him to remove troublesome congressmen from power, although this would drop all pretense of national democracy even if local elections and interaction with the government through town councils and party machines continue to exist."

Privately, the Archbishop desires increased funding for Catholic diocoses, for Long to endorse friendship with Catholic nations and for it to be easier to Catholic immigrants to become naturalized immigrants. However Coughlin supporters still in the AFP do not desire any such agreement, thinking Long should do it without their approval since they view the clericy with suspicion for not endorsing them sooner.

Although [TEX.GetLeader] has solidifed their position for now, it is a tenuous place to be, and an insurgent faction could very well take over. If the President presides over the funeral, it is unclear how the crowd will react, but if we were to give the speech to someone else, they could use it to their own advantage. Realizing that a choice must be made, accusations have already begun to fly. Gerald L. K. Smith has been quick to take advantage of Earl Long's uneasy relationship with his brother, noting that he was closer to the deceased man that Earl had ever been. In response, Earl Long is reported to have quipped that Gerald was a highfalutin talker who Huey wanted gone a long time ago. Charles Coughlin, noting his own movement and his ability to bring the largest crowd of anyone to honor Huey, has claimed that a true man of god should deliver the speech. To this, Smith shot back that he was a better priest than Coughlin ever was, and a better speaker at that. Earl Long, meanwhile, merely noted that his family never had much love for Romanism. Amidst the bickering, the various leftist factions have united around Bronson Cutting as their speaker of choice, noting his quiet but stalwart support for Long's proposals through his career. Few have paid close attention to this, with all opposed accusing Cutting of harboring secret anti-Longist views. A compromise candidate has also emerged, in the form of Russell B. Long, the son of the late Huey. Though the boy has shown some political acumen of his own, he is too young and inexperienced to gain power for himself, and so many have held him up as the perfect choice.

Meanwhile, the Bellamyists under Alfred Bingham are reluctant to support such a depiction, fearful of the ramifications it might have for their movement, specifically their supposed plans for democracy. Instead, they argue that any monument should take a form similar to the Lincoln Memorial, with emphasis on Long's visionary ability rather than his power. Father Charles Coughlin, meanwhile, has advocated a humble, human-size statue of Huey Long, so that he can be with the people as he was in life. While his motives seem noble, his detractors whisper that Coughlin fears being outshined by the former leader, and would happily erect a large statue, if only it depicted him. What should we do?"

unionstate.5107.d:0 "As soon as Huey Long was tragically shot and killed, accusations of a conspiracy spread like wildfire across the country. Some, largely in the left flank of the AFP, argued that Gerald K. Smith, who doubled as a bodyguard for Huey Long, had been complicit in the murder, conveniently failing to do his job. It is often said that Smith was aligned with Father Charles Coughlin for this task, and that the two figures were never loyal to begin with, given Coughlin's movement and Smith's naked ambition. Meanwhile, others, including Smith and Coughlin, responded by accusing Earl Long of involvement in the assassination. They note Earl's strained relationship with his brother, and his inability to find a place in the sun so long as Huey was alive. With his brother dead, they argue, Earl is free to gain the power he always wanted. Smith has also taken to blaming the Bellamyist faction as well, arguing that the Independence League has closer ties to the Red Belt than it ever did to Huey Long. For their part, the Independence League has taken to blaming outsiders, openly wondering over foreign involvement and making their usual appeals to patriotism. While there is not substantial evidence for any of the claims, it is clear we must take some sort of action. Who shall we pursue?"

President Bingham is no exception, having been inspired and heavily influenced by Sinclair's famous End Poverty in California (EPIC) campaign calling for guaranteed pensions, progressive income taxes, seizures of idle land, and more extensive public agencies. Now, many of the policies called for by Sinclair years ago are being seriously considered for implementation by the Bingham administration. This is not without controversy, as Sinclair joined the ranks of the now defunct Pacific government during the Civil War. There are no two ways about it, Sinclair is a traitor who joined an illegitimate government and believed the Union State strayed too far from the democratic vision of America. Nonetheless, the President believes that although he was on the wrong side of history, Sinclair is still a good man with good ideas and a genuine commitment to bettering America. Bingham has even considered inviting Sinclair into the administration as Secretary of Commerce. The rest of the cabinet advise that such a move could hurt the President's perception among the people after the droves of anti-Pacific propaganda we issued. Vice President Amlie suggests that the EPIC Plan be adopted nationwide, but stop short of making him an official. Others still believe any association with Sinclair or his plans would betray Bingham's vision for a socialist America led for the middle class and create a slippery slope of allying with other former socialist  figures regardless of their allegiances.

In the leadup to the Civil War, both men quietly agreed to influence different factions in the war, with Bingham working in the AUS while Dewey and other Bellamyists joined the CSA. Of course, the war is now behind us, and Bingham bears no ill towards his old friend for siding with the Syndicalists. After all, it was Dewey who taught Bingham the importance of having pragmatism. In fact, the President wishes to formally rehabilitate and reward Dewey for his decades of service to the country by bringing him into his administration. Most of the cabinet agrees, suggesting Dewey and other Bellamyists be sent as an advisor to develop and ideally, promote our policies, in the Red Belt. In this post he could educate and help administrators in the region to better implement policy by employing his many great ideas. While Bingham supports sending Bellamyists to the Red Belt, he is more partial to having Dewey specifically oversee education in the country. Dewey is best known for his work in education reform, and this would effectively hand him the reins to complete his vision of transforming educational institutions into progressive services that will advance society and promote constant intellectual growth, concepts that Bingham has long admired. Many are still skeptical about giving a former traitor this much power in the country, and some of Dewey's detractors implore the President to reconsider rehabilitating Dewey altogether and let him continue his work outside of government.

Americans must take the fight to the Jews before they can bring us to ruin, and to do that, we must strip them of their greatest weapon: wealth. President Smith has issued an executive order that high-level bankers and other economic elites shall be targeted and separated from their profits. Furthermore, the final blow shall be dealt as the Hebrews reel from their losses. The bankers, industrialists, and executives shall be arrested, subject to trial, and by God's will, rightly imprisoned.

Born in Canada in the late 19th century, he is, according to the Constitution, not eligible to run. However, the bill proposed would allow those with at least 10 years of citizenship and residency in the United States to legally become Commander in-Chief. The bill's proposal has been met with mixed reactions. Some claim that the 'political revolution' brought on by Long and his followers should see new radical changes to how the government is run, and that America should use this opportunity to allow Americanized immigrants to become President, given they've taken time to serve their new country. The next bloc takes a moderate approach. They recognize Coughlin's obvious designs on power and claim that due to his 'exemplary service' during the war to Long and the Union State, he should be given an exception and be allowed to run for President. Huey himself has been in favor of this resolution, seeing it as a fair compromise. Finally, the last group considers itself the most fundamentally true to the old U.S., claiming that 'the original genius of the Founding Fathers', that being the Constitution, shouldn't be altered in any way. They also see the bill as a potentially slippery slope that would allow dangerous foreign actors to wield far more influence in politics than before.

Numerous recordings, papers, correspondence, memorabilia, and other materials have been donated by the Long family, associates of the late President, and the America First Party.

A grand opening is scheduled for the next August 30th, Huey's birthday. While progress continues smoothly, controversy has emerged regarding the way the project will be funded. Left leaning members of the AFP advocate for the museum to be tax funded, which they argue is the least contentious and most convenient option, considering Huey's popularity and our already high tax rate. Rose Long and her family has requested that they be allowed to raise funds for the site, and while this is likely to be extremely successful and could potentially even raise support for the Party, Smith would much rather have himself or one of his key allies lead the fundraiser than a family he sees as rivals. Henry Ford and Secretary of the Interior Meade McClanahan have quietly persuaded Smith to consider having Jewish citizens pay for the project. They frame the issue as one of the Jews needing to give President Smith and America reparations after one of their own murdered Huey Long. After all, the President has already gone so far as to detain famed Jewish Louisiana architect and frequent Long collaborator Leon C. Weiss when he offered his services to the project for suspicions of embezzlement and connection to Long assassin Carl Weiss.

He has even dared to ask major party leaders to join him in voicing opposition to Smith so that they can put in place a new President that will restore the original purpose and ideals the Party once boasted, when the opportunity arises. Weiss' political rebellion was quickly put down following a series of scathing speeches in which the President has attacked Weiss. Smith has asserted that Weiss worked to sabotage Huey Long at every turn, leading a Jewish conspiracy to stop Huey Long from freeing the poor people in America from elitist forces. This conspiracy was responsible for most of Long's more questionable policies and, ultimately, his tragic assassination. Indeed, his Jewish last name is shared by Long's assassin, Dr. Carl Weiss, proving their connection and cementing the allegations as the truth in the eyes of Smith and his supporters. Tensions peaked as battle erupted in the French Quarter of New Orleans at one point, with mobs of enraged citizens threatening to exact revenge on Weiss for the death of Huey clashing with police.

Men like Paul Maloney, 'Big Jim' Folsom, Sid McMath, and Bronson Cutting all have supporters of their own, as well as a certain degree of influence within the party. However, they are not in the position to demand concessions for their support-they aren't as powerful as many of the other lieutenants.

unionstate.5129.d:0 "This afternoon marks the grand opening of the latest in the line of President Smith's pet projects. The President and Secretary of the Interior Meade McClanahan have dreamed of construction their "Sacred Project" ever since the Civil War concluded. Upon taking office, Smith quietly commissioned sculptor Emmett Sullivan to make this dream a reality and lead the construction of a life-sized recreation of ancient Jerusalem as it appeared in the time of Christ. The Springfield Plateau within the Ozark Mountains on the border of Arkansas and Missouri was chosen for its stunning geographic similarity to Jerusalem. There a massive team was assembled to carry out the project, and over the next several years progress was reportedly steady, but strained. The President himself donated over $1,000,000 to the project from his own pocket and raised much more, but rumors of the Jewish population being coerced to "gift" great sums to the creation of the New Jerusalem were pervasive until the mass deportations of the Jews. Indeed, a massive statue of Christ was built to overlook the city, representing the Christian victory over the Jewish and Roman forces that occupied Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the work is done, and the President has officially opened up the city for the good Christian public to enjoy! Upon entering, however, visitors were shocked to learn that the "city" was more of a Jerusalem styled Christian theme park. Artworks are in every building, the center of the metropolis holds an amphitheater where the Passion of Christ is retold. Even more startling were the "Museum of Earth History", exploring the true, creationist history of the world, and the rollercoaster ride depicting Jesus' journey carrying the Cross up to Calvary Hill. Surprisingly, despite subverting expectations, the site has had a very successful first day. Numerous attendees left feeling reinvigorated, thrilled, and even more devout! Tourism in the Ozarks is expected to boom, and President Smith is most pleased."

unionstate.5130.t:0 "The Rivalry with Frances Sweeney"
unionstate.5130.d:0 "One of the most vicious and prominent opponents of the Coughlin administration has been Frances Sweeney, lead editor and author of the Boston City Reporter. Sweeney, a Catholic herself and well known in the Irish-American community, began her rise to stardom by denouncing the Irish gangs in Boston who, inspired by President Coughlin's rhetoric, terrorized the Jewish population of the city. Her advocacy helped to raise awareness of the extent of the antisemitism of the city and convince the Mayor of Boston, James Michael Curley, to provide greater police protection for the Jewish neighborhoods. Her passionate work was eyed with cautious optimism by AFP officials hoping to potentially sway her to become a voice for Coughlin's wider agenda. However, Sweeney was not content to deal with Boston alone. In her rapidly expanding paper, she has criticized the America First Party as a corrupt organization and President Coughlin as a man who has strayed from the Church and distorted the Lord's message. In her scathing articles, Sweeney has openly called Coughlin an anti-semite and demanded for him to stop subverting the liberties of fellow Americans and our “elder brothers in the faith”, who have endured much of the same oppression that Catholics in America have. Indeed, her threat is so great that at every single AFP event she protests, her followers grow larger."
unionstate.5130.a:0 "This is a problem..."

unionstate.5131.t:0 "A Problem No More"
unionstate.5131.d:0 "Cardinal O’Connell of Boston’s excommunication of Sweeney was expected to quell her dissent, but only inflamed it. More and more progressive Catholics and people disillusioned with the administration have endorsed Sweeney and joined her efforts across the nation. President Coughlin has decided he had enough. After Congress passed an act transferring Sweeney’s assets and the Boston City Reporter to the government, Minutemen reportedly raided the headquarters of her newspaper. Charged with “actions aimed at undermining national security” and “subverting federal authority.” Sweeney’s trial was little more than a kangaroo court, thanks to executive pressure. After a brief month of proceedings, Frances Sweeney was sentenced to 12 years in prison for treason. Despite Sweeney’s young age, her health has rapidly declined due to rheumatic heart disease. With her life expectancy low after only barely surviving a heart attack this morning, Sweeney’s supporters mourn their defeat, and many Catholics and Jews quietly reflect on the life and work of the brave young journalist and question what is next for the country. For now, however, President Coughlin has gotten one step closer to realizing his great ambitions for America, and celebrates the peace from overcoming this upstart opposition."

### Pelley Events ###

unionstate.52.t:0 "Fate of Murphy Ranch"
unionstate.52.d:0 "Now that our Legion reaches from coast to coast, we must revisit our place of final resort Pelley had planned out. In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"
unionstate.52.a:0 "Fortify it."
unionstate.52.b:0 "Convert it."

unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"
unionstate.53.a:0 "Too many would fear this."
unionstate.53.b:0 "The world is ready."

unionstate.54.t:0 "Pelley Speech Attracts Controversy!"
unionstate.54.d:0 "During a controversial speech presidential candidate William Dudley Pelley endorsed what he has called the 'Ward System' for various groups labeled 'unproductive' which would ensure they do not receive full Commonwealth benefits until they are labeled as productive and would be relegated to largely labor jobs in the mean time. Naturally this has attracted a large amount of criticism while also appealing to former Democrats and racially conservative Republicans despite Pelley's claim the Ward System is 'radically different' from the ODP's Segregation platforms. Perhaps speaking out against it can increase our percent of the black and liberal votes, although it does threaten to drive away some voters."
unionstate.54.a:0 "Denounce the Speech"
unionstate.54.b:0 "Do nothing"

unionstate.55.t:0 "The Silver Cavalcade!"
unionstate.55.d:0 "With President Pelley having won a surprise electoral victory it has become clear that he needs to further his grassroots support if his most ambitious plans are to have any hope of succeeding. After several meetings with his advisors the President believes he has come up with the ideal plan for this, a nationwide barnstorming tour with members of the Christian Party and the Silver Legion. Seen live, broadcast both on radio and recorded to be shown after the fact, the Silver Cavalcade as it is now being called internally will surely spread our message further than ever before."
unionstate.55.a:0 "Fund it"
unionstate.55.b:0 "Actually, let's wait on this"

unionstate.56.t:0 "Jewish Segregation?"
unionstate.56.d:0 "As our platform is implemented more and more, one of the President's more controversial ideas has again reared its head. In Pelley’s mind the influence of the American Jewish population on both the capitalist and syndicalist systems and the growing population of politically aware Gentiles necessitates that they need to be stripped of certain rights for the time being, ostensibly for their own protection. Under the plan the Jewish population in each state would be moved to a single city until the Commonwealth system is fully implemented, at which time the President promises they will again receive full rights. Regardless of his promises though the idea has attracted outrage from a not insignificant portion of the population who claim it will lead to mass abuses and other rights violations, and on the other hand the hardliners in the Christian Party are demanding an immediate implementation of the plan. It seems like no matter what choice we make could cause us further problems in the future."
unionstate.56.a:0 "Implement it"
unionstate.56.b:0 "It's too controversial"

unionstate.57.t:0 "Our Problem Children"
unionstate.57.d:0 "In recent years the Christian Party has blossomed to become one of the largest in these United States, however this has not been without its own set of problems. Several elements of the Christian Party, particularly those in California, have taken their rhetoric far and beyond what the national leadership has. Led by Henry D. Allen's wing of the party as well as the increasingly controversial Gerald L.K. Smith it espouses radical racialist doctrines and promoting ideas such as the mass expulsion of Jews from the United States, these groups are increasingly harming the Presidents image and one way or another we need to make a choice on how to best handle the situation, with Willard Kemp offering to help reign them in via private conversations and threats of expulsion."
unionstate.57.a:0 "Do nothing"
unionstate.57.b:0 "Reign them in"

unionstate.58.t:0 "Slow growth of Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.d:0 "One of the more peculiar parts of President Pelley’s beliefs are his esoteric approach to Christianity. Known under several different names in prior years, Soulcraft Doctrine as it is now known has seen a slow but steady growth under the Pelley administration. Whilst the President has suspended any new publications on the matter to avoid First Amendment cases, prior works such as the Golden Scripts are being sold in higher numbers and more and more people seem open to exploring the President's ideas on not just politics and economics, but spirituality as well. Of course, this has also caused ridicule from papers such as the L.A. Times who mock Pelley as a 'guru', making many in the party reluctant to push the matter further."
unionstate.58.a:0 "Publish more Soulcraft"
unionstate.58.b:0 "A fine development"

unionstate.59.t:0 "Calling in Favors"
unionstate.59.d:0 "It is no secret that the President is the most powerful man in these United States, but even a powerful man at times has need for favors and assistance. In the years before he assumed the Presidency Pelley acquired a long list of contacts in several fields, particularly in finance, industry and politics, through his authorship followed by his leadership of the Silver Legion. Whilst our programs are being speedily implemented and the Chiefs vision of America becomes truer by the day it might be wise to call in these favors and outstanding debts, even if it might appear unpopular to the masses."
unionstate.59.a:0 "Of course"
unionstate.59.b:0 "No, it's corrupt"

unionstate.5900.t:0 "The Ward System"
unionstate.5900.d:0 "Due to his campaign promises, the Pelley administration is faced with a controversial idea that needs resolved. In the past, now President Pelley spoke of a system that in his eyes would allow the government to best help and uplift its most impoverished citizens. Known as the Ward System, the idea would see those Americans identified as most impoverished (particularly Appalachian whites, deep southern blacks and Mexican immigrants) become Wards of the state and be brought under its care. However, Pelley identifies these elements as the most unproductive in society and would deny them full Commonwealth benefits, relegating them to largely labor jobs. While in theory the system would be used to educate these peoples and ensure they can enter the Commonwealths workforce on an equal footing some have expressed outrage and compared the idea to modern slavery. The President calls these claims outrageous and a step forward from the old Jim Crow system but a choice must be made on the matter immediately, with challenges by ACLU and NAACP lawyers as well as the opposition parties making the mainstream of the CP more reluctant to endorse it."
unionstate.5900.a:0 "Implement the Wards"
unionstate.5900.b:0 "No, we should step back"

unionstate.5901.t:0 "Cleansing Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.d:0 "Before entering the realms of either spirituality or politics, Pelley was a rather successful screenwriter for Hollywood and while he eventually grew disgusted with the industry and its supposed Syndicalist influence he has always maintained a fondness for the silver screen, and in turn it began to despise him. Recently the President organized a showing of several of the films he helped make in his heyday at the White House and afterwards he announced a number of executive orders seeking to cleanse Hollywood of any anti-American sentiments and sponsoring the opening of new studios so that Americans may once again enjoy cinema if Hollywood did not 'clean up its act' at once. Much of the right-wing of the CP is pushing for him to simply implement these policies now however and Pelley would prefer it that way, although many in the cabinet view it as too radical."
unionstate.5901.a:0 "Clean up Hollywood"
unionstate.5901.b:0 "We'll give them a chance"

unionstate.5902.t:0 "The First Americans"
unionstate.5902.d:0 "Is there any group more disadvantaged and stepped on in the modern United States than its original inhabitants? President Pelley certainly doesn’t think that’s the case, having for several years written about the plights of various Indian groups and peoples and the attempts by various groups to seize their lands or turn them to beliefs like Syndicalism in an effort to manipulate them. In a recent speech to Congress the President swore that these transgressions would end now and forever, promising to strengthen and strongly enforce the treaties the Federal Government has with the Indian Nations and ensure these groups have equal opportunities under the Commonwealth system."

unionstate.5903.d:0 "One of Pappy O'Daniel's most ambitious desires is to bring the business community together with the poor farmers and workers he represents, and to find amicable compromises between all parties involved. Thus far, O'Daniel's attempts to reach out to big businesses both within the Union State and without have been met with failure. Businessmen have shown distaste for the faction representing the same populist values of men like William Jennings Bryan and "Fighting Bob" La Follette Sr., and O'Daniel will have to work hard to make such men feel comfortable in the country. To do so, we have a range of options. We could further cut taxes on businesses, encouraging them to come to Great Plains states, in particular Texas. However, such cuts may be unpopular with other parties and allow them to cut into our support base. We could also target certain industries, from finance to construction to the oil industry, in the hopes of increasing their interest in our country. This would be easier to accomplish, but will obviously benefit us less. What shall we do?"

unionstate.5904.t:0 "O'Daniel's Five-Point Plan"
unionstate.5904.d:0 "Today, Pappy O'Daniel brought his plan for America's economic recovery to Congress. His five points include $40 million in new revenue, the abolition of the poll tax and of capital punishment, the appointment of a state-appointed budget director, and an amendment banning deficit spending. Though he was initially optimistic about the passage of the entire plan, it met some opposition from left-wingers in the AFP and the NPP who claimed that it was nowhere near enough to solve the current crisis. Further, while the Christian Party largely supported the proposals, Gerald K. Smith and other right-wing AFP members opposed the legislation, with some arguing it was too liberal and others arguing it went against everything Huey Long had fought for. As such, we may need to cut some of the proposals from the bill, but which proposals should be cut?"

unionstate.5905.t:0 "The Debate over Pensions"
unionstate.5905.d:0 "One of O'Daniel's most persistent promises to his supporters was the implementation of old-age pensions for the nation's elderly population. As such, he has been eager to push this proposal and codify it into law, but it seems that his political inexperience has limited him in this pursuit. O'Daniel failed to even gain the support of some of his fellow Texan congressmen, with the questions of how this pension system will be funded still unclear. For his part, the Texan leader is apparently frustrated at this setback, but he pledges to carry on with his agenda nonetheless. Instead of an old-age pension system, he has instead begun to formulate a plan for post-war America, in which pensions will be granted to veterans as a way of easing the country, or more acurately, his fellow politicians, into the idea of pensions for all elderly citizens. This "Dependent and Disability Act" will be just what O'Daniel needs to push old-age pensions forward."
unionstate.5905.a:0 "Crooked politicians!"

unionstate.5906.t:0 "The Dependent and Disability Act Passes"
unionstate.5906.d.pappy:0 "The events of today were the culmination of years of planning on the part of W. Lee O'Daniel. Today, a form of O'Daniel's proposed pension program has been passed through Congress, and it is popular enough now that though he has largely abandoned any hope for pensions, his people cry out for them as a necessary form of relief. The most difficult part in passing the act was finding the source of funding for it, but due to his high popularity, he was able to force the implementation of a 1.6% tax on business transactions into law, providing more than enough funding for this program. O'Daniel does not plan to stop here, and in fact, he hopes to renew his push for elderly pensions as well. Time will tell whether this proposal succeeds, however."
unionstate.5906.d.other:0 "Today, the Dependent and Disability Act was officially codified into law. The successful passage of the act marks a victory for [TEX.GetLeader], who had helped push for this act as a way of thanking the patriotic veterans who made victory possible for the Union State.

unionstate.5907.d:0 "Pappy O'Daniel's "Hillbilly Boy" band was instrumental in getting him elected as leader of the American Union State. Now, with his position secure, the members of the band expect some sort of reward for their loyalty, and O'Daniel is happy to give it to them. However, we must decide how we wish to go about this. We could grant them even more power in the government than they currently hold, meaning more positions for them in the cabinet. Alternatively, we could make them fabuously wealthy, and keep sending them on tours around the country. Do we need these men in government, or around the country?"

unionstate.5908.t:0 "Economy in Government"
unionstate.5908.d:0 "One of W. Lee O'Daniel's promises was to bring "economy to government". By this, he did not mean that the government would be more concerned with economic issues. Instead, he meant that the corrupt politicians in Texas, the Great Plains, and the country as a whole had used spending they promised to their people for their own gain or purposes, while the people suffered under their rule. One of the worst instances of this misuse was last week, when O'Daniel was informed that $1 million for oprhanages was instead being siphoned off to pay for party machine costs. Another instance was when $3 million meant to help buy new tanks apparently disappeared, and such instances are not uncommon. O'Daniel believes this wasteful spending to be distasteful, inefficient, and worst of all, immoral. However, to get the spending of our government officials back on track, should we..."

unionstate.5909.d:0 "From the very beginnings of his political career, Pappy O'Daniel has had a desire to slice taxes for his people and give them the ability to spend again. However, he has met significant opposition from the left in this endeavor. Mainstream Longists have protested that such cuts, particularly on the wealthy, would go against the ideals of Huey Long. Meanwhile, those in the NPP argue that these tax cuts are merely an excuse to make the Union State more attractive to wealthy investors. O'Daniel has not denied this charge, happy to admit that he wants more investment in Texas and the country as a whole, and he has even shot back that anyone who does not want such investment is as bad as the politicians who got us into this crisis to begin with. \n\nRhetoric aside, though, it is apparent that O'Daniel will have a hard time forcing his ideal tax laws through without tweaking them. Should we decide to cut poll taxes, we will surely gain the support of leftists and the common people, while slicing taxes on businesses will likely bring more investment in our economy, regardless of the state of the nation's politics or military."

If we can push this legislation through Congress, O'Daniel will be remembered for both reconstruction and his own plans. Should we move forward with this policy?"

One interesting case of this is a collection of short stories by Texas writer R. E. Howard, which have just been released. These stories, like 'The Pride of Bear Creek' or 'Pistol Politics', focus on describing adventurous life in the American Frontier. Stories about gunslingers such as the Sonora Kid are especially popular in this genre, appealing to a wide swath of readers. This does not mean, however, that the author wrote Western stories only in this narrowly understood subgenre. Literary works such as the adventures of the Texan traveler Francis Xavier Gordon in 'The Coming of El Borak', 'Hawk of the Hills' or 'The Country of the Knife' or even horrors stories such as 'Black Canaan'  or 'Pigeons from Hell' are all part of the Western genre, even if they are less traditional. Meanwhile, the popularity of Howard's Westerns is now so great that no one remembers the rest of the literary attempts to create other pulp heroes, such as the boring Conan the Barbarian or the naive puritan Solomon Kane."

unionstate.5913.t:0 "Racial Segregation in Trade Unions"
unionstate.5913.d:0 "Until recently, the demands of some trade unions were too far-reaching. Postulates of non-American and non-Christian initiatives, probably inspired by immigrant conspirators from syndicalist Europe, are not only a threat to American values but also harmful to the entire economic system. These includes issues such as desegregation in workplaces or the equalization of wages of White and Colored workers. The abolition of the unions would, of course, be harmful, as it would leave workers vulnerable to crooked politicians. A promising solution to this problem was proposed as early as 1924, by the unionist Samuel Gompers. He claimed that 'the Caucasians are not going to let their standard of living be destroyed by Negroes, Chinamen, Japs, or any other…. If the colored man continues to lend himself to the work of tearing down what the White man has built up, a race hatred worse than any ever known before will result.' For this reason, he suggested creating separate trade unions only for White Americans. Keeping blacks from joining trade unions would increase the influence of Whites in the government by strengthening the power of the workers' strike. Interestingly, even the extremist William Z. Foster had such remarks in the past. In 1920 he called blacks 'a race of strikebreakers'. So a firm decision must be made. Will we maintain segregation in the new trade unions or allow racially mixed unions to function?"

However, academics in our country must not be infected with anti-American or subversive thought. Some academics in fields such as social sciences, anthropology and the humanities have been known to transmit progressive and even harmful ideas to their students. Some even see a sinister influence in fields such as modern physics or biological sciences. The simple fact is that free and uncontrolled universities can become hotspots for subversive thought under the pretext of academic freedom. To combat this, Pappy O'Daniel plans to put favorable representatives on the Universities Regents Councils to control what is taught. Although some criticize this project, others, including Coke Stevenson, even encouraged more radical action including the removal of defiant professors."

These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibtion Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week. Currently legislation is frozen, and it appears the so-called Dixiecrats are taking all their vacation days at once."

We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us.

After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers. If he strongarms the amendment, as many of his advisers suggest, it dispels the illusion of democracy we so dearly need to maintain."

unionstate.302.d:0 "As unrest over wartime conditions advanced from the frontlines, past the Mid-Atlantic, and into Maryland, the Vatican Volunteers took the opportunity to begin an uprising, with the goal of storming the city of Baltimore.\n\nCrossing into the city over the river from Fort Armistead, under heavy fire, the volunteers came on ramshackle barges for the most part. However, with the aid of Catholic elements in the city, the Papal Militia was able to land at Sparrow's Point, and rushed headlong into the teeth of the enemy resistance along the riverside. The troops then split their forces and cunningly used the cover of back alleyways and side streets, advancing inward as the main forces battled the enemy across the main boulevards and through city parks. At the crescendo of the fighting in the city, the Papal volunteers, in a display of near-suicidal bravery, at once advanced on the enemy forces entrenched on Gulford Avenue outside City Hall.\n\nMeanwhile, Longist sympathizers, with the aid of a number of local volunteers, Catholic or otherwise, charged the barricades, overwhelming local law enforcement forces, causing many of them to simply break rank and flee. While many militiamen lost their lives in the fighting, including the heroic sacrifice of the militia leader, Father Emilio Arandes, the city has yet to fall. Luckily, reinforcements under the leadership of Union State officers stand poised to take the area if they can beat back the forces now rushing to save the city. Only time will tell what the outcome of the conflict will be, but some within the High Command are already angry with the impudence displayed by the militia, with an anonymous officer stating in private that "this war is our war, not their personal crusade""
unionstate.302.a:0 "We will be watching closely!"

unionstate.303.t:0 "Philip Acosta Carroll assumes leadership of the Baltimore Uprising"
unionstate.303.d:0 "A vigil was held for the late Father Arandes in Baltimore today as members of both the Papal Militia and the local Catholic community arrived to honor the sacrifice of the volunteers who have given their lives in the ongoing uprising in Maryland. Among those in attendance beside the memorials to Arandes was a pious dignitary from among Maryland's Catholic elite. Philip Acosta Carroll, an army officer and an irreverently patriotic and deeply religious supporter of the Papal Volunteers, has replaced Arandes as leader of the Baltimore Uprising. Givinb a speech at the vigil, he now hopes to win the battle for Arandes and the millions of American Catholics.\n\nCarroll has the distinction of being a direct descendant of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, known to history as one of America's Founding Fathers. As the only Catholic signatory of the Declaration of Independence, not to mention a man hailed as the principal financial supporter of the American Revolution, many historians credit the institution of Freedom of Religion in the Constitution as a means of honoring the contribution of a Catholic's diligence and charity to a largely Protestant country's war of independence.\n\n Now, hundreds of years after the American Revolution, the United States stands at the forefront of another revolution, and it is here, as before, that Philip Carroll, like the Lord of Carrollton before him, has pledged himself to the American Union State. In accordance with recent communiques with the Vatican, Carroll has formally assumed leadership of the Papal Militia, ready to lead the Catholic faithful in taking Baltimore and America as a whole, fighting to the last against the scourge of the Syndicalist and Stratocrat alike.\n\nThis news has been met with an immense upswing in support, causing a massive swell in donations and volunteers for the uprising in Baltimore, and it may just be enough to ensure victory for Carroll. However, if Carroll should fail to take the city, plans are being drafted to help him and his fellow officers retreat west to the more stable holdings of the Union State. Regardless, there have also been volunteers elsewhere for the American Union State, both for Huey long's Minutemen and the Carroll's Papal Militia, this will no doubt put us one step closer to victory!"

unionstate.304.t:0 "The Holy American League"
unionstate.304.d:0 "With the end of the Second American Civil War, the Papal Volunteers, seeing a surge in popularity for their role in consolidating America under the Kingfish, have begun an effort to reorganize themselves to be better able to continue to aid the American people in the post-war era. To that end, their commander, Philip Acosta Carroll, along with a high-profile cabal of devout Catholics from the political theater, have announced the formation of the Holy American League. The League itself is a non-profit organization dedicated to the values of charity, Catholicism, diligence and the American spirit.\n\n Within this new coalition, Carroll and his militia have surrounded themselves with a posse of political elite. One of the more well known figures is New York Governor Al Smith,the Brooklyn-born democrat credited with a reputation as a venerable elder statesmen. It is hoped that Smith's moderate reputation would help legitimize the League in the eyes of the Senate and Congress. In addition to Smith, among the founders of the League, most controversially, includes woman's suffrage activist and known socialist sympathizer Dorothy Day, who is herself most known for her relationship with the SPA. While Long has been comparatively lenient in allowing Day to continue to operate within America, the League has still garnered a great deal of public criticism for Day's history with the CSA. Day's involvement might explain the strange absence of the loudest and most obvious supporter of American Catholics, Charles Coughlin.\n\nWhile Coughlin himself was quite loud and ardent in his initial support of Carroll and the volunteers, the alignment with Day has turned Coughlin into the League's most scathing critic. He has verbally ripped apart the League on his radio show, stating loudly that he will oppose any measure that seeks to uproot the sanctity of American faith."
unionstate.304.a:0 "First Smith, now Coughlin...maybe they have a point."

unionstate.305.t:0 "Holy American League Aids in Reconstuction"
unionstate.305.d:0 "As the first step in the Holy American League's plan to aid in the reconstruction effort of America, Philip Acosta Carroll, in concert with Al Smith and Dorothy Day, has begun establishing humanitarian aid camps throughout the eastern seaboard. From Baltimore to Miami to Baton Rouge, the volunteers under Carroll and the League have set about distributing food and water, providing medical aid, and setting up hospital camps.\n\nFurther, they have begun conducting religious services and education for children, cleared rubble, and in the Black Belt, many African Americans have found refuge with the Catholic volunteers. These volunteers tirelessly labor to heal and rebuild the Black communities damaged by the war, openly forsaking and condemning the racial violence suffered by the Black minority in the South and fully embracing the unity of Black and White Americans.\n\nAs one might imagine, this sentiment was not received well by the Dixiecrats of the Southern political elite, who protested Huey Long's leniency with the League's sphere of influence spreading so far south. Many of these critics are beginning to align with Gerald L.K Smith about the Catholic presence in the South, and even Charles Coughlin, despite his militant Anti-Klan stance, can't help but look at the League's increasing influence with African Americans with skepticism. Nonetheless, the efforts of the Holy American League have very much impressed Huey Long, who publicly praised the efforts of Philip Carroll and the League for helping to stitch America back together again."

unionstate.306.t:0 "Zealous Protestants clash with Catholic Converts"
unionstate.306.d:0 "Ever since the founding of the Holy American League, they have done their best to provide aid to destitute Americans. Now, the League's militiamen and humanitarian workers have seen a huge increase in support across America, with many New Englanders and African Americans in the Deep South flocking to the ranks of the League. More importantly, the increase in popularity of the League also coincides with an increase in religious conversions to Roman Catholicism throughout America.\n\nInevitably, this was going to lead to a confrontation with the most conservative Protestant elements in America. Spurred on by botg Gerald L. K. Smith's rhetoric and the remnants of the Klan, increasingly frequent incidents of violence between the League and the mostly conservative Protestant population have been reported in the Deep South.\n\nIndeed, much of the Christian right in America are furious at what they see as the encroachment against traditional American values and claim that the presence of the League, whom they decry as 'Papists', are part of a conspiracy enacted by the Vatican to purge all Americans who refuse to submit to Papal Autocracy.\n\nWe must watch these groups, for they are preaching that the League's favoritism of the negro population is an obvious ploy to usurp the authority of the White Man. Already, reports of vicious hate crimes and atrocities have begun to surface, some as far north of the Black Belt as Virginia. The situation appears to be rapidly spiraling out of control; many former Old Democrats and even influential Louisianan and Texan politicians are complaining to the Kingfish personally about what they see as the League's arbitration.\n\nAll of this presents a difficult dilemma to Huey Long, as much of his support is reliant on the conservative Protestant farmers in the West and South, and as such, the crisis must be handled with delicacy and tact. In other news, Charles Coughlin's weekly radio broadcasts have been postponed for undisclosed reasons."

unionstate.307.d:0 "With the current situation in the country becoming ever more tenuous, a meeting was called today. President Huey Long, Field Marshal Jacob L. Devers, and Christian populist Gerald L. K. Smith were called together. Amidst a storm of accusations, posturing, and fingerpointing as to whom did or didn't do what, a solution arose to the issue of the Holy American League that seemed a far more extreme measure than Long had anticipated, and yet, it might be one of the better options available to him.\n\n Smith has proposed an Anti-Catholic Bill, the beginning of a means to counter the influence of the growing Catholic influence on the population. This measure would also help in artificially limiting their influence within the American government. Smith remains adamant that the League's modus operandi is to seize control of the American Union State and turn it into a puppet state loyal to no authority but the Holy See. While the Kingfish was quick to dismiss Smith's ramblings, Devers' concerns about Carroll and the League are much more realistic.\n\nDevers does, indeed, agree that it is unlikely that a conspiracy by Rome is ongoing, however, he points out that Carroll himself, from an outside perspective, seems to be positioning himself as a potential leader for the Catholic minority. Further, he is also positioning himself as the voice of minority rights of those oppressed largely by evangelical protestants in the nation, combined with the alliance between Carroll, Al Smith and Dorothy Day, Devers postulates that this would be a powerful force.\n\nWhile maintaining that any sort of armed coup d'état is unlikely,  Philip Carroll is possibly positioning himself to run for President to unseat Huey Long in the next election. Furthermore, even though Devers claims that the unrest in the South can be easily brought into line with some well-placed peace keeping forces, perhaps combined with Long applying pressure to convince Charles Coughlin to support the League to help foster better relations between the League and other Christian groups, it might also be in Long's interest to, if Carroll's influence is indeed growing, to consider passing the anti-Catholic bill to ensure a comfortable majority in the polls."

Their purpose that night was to briefly oversee the deliberation over the new Anti-Catholic Bill being considered, arriving well ahead of the congressmen. Despite the eerie emptiness of the building once inside, Long's inner circle was certain that the night would conclude decisively.Their assumptions would be proven right.\n\nThe last anyone saw of the Kingfish and his cabinet was in Smith's office, where the three men sat, laughing, joking, and drinking, cavalier at their impending success. As they listened to the new broadcast of Charles Coughlin's radio show, the first one in a long while. Father Coughlin spoke of the impending Bill that sought to curtail his faith, and in so doing, usurp the faith that defined not only his identity, but that of a large, and growing, minority of the country.\n\nAs his show for the night came to a close, the last words that came over the radio were: "And my wrath shall wax hot; I shall kill you with the sword, and you will find that your wives shall be widows and your children, fatherless."\n\nThe Capital Building of the United States, the spitting image of American democratic values, then erupted in an inferno as crate after crate of high-grade explosives detonated in the sewers below. Long, Connor and Smith, and a scant number of the Minutemen, were incinerated in the blast, the former seat of the United States Congress completely burnt to cinder.\n\n By the next morning, coalition forces of both the Minutemen, under the command of Father Charles Coughlin, and the Holy American League, under the auspices of Philip Acosta Carroll, seized control of the White House just as similar elements consolidated power in Atlanta, St. Louis, Houston, and New Orleans. By that afternoon, radio communiques with Field Marshal Devers would affirm the peaceful transition of command of the armed forces to the administration of the coalition government of Carroll and Coughlin, and by evening, Philip Acosta Carroll would be sworn in as the new President of America."

unionstate.309.t:0 "An American Monarch?"
unionstate.309.d:0 "With the rise of the Holy American League, the question of what the League's governmental reforms will entail have begun to manifest, and it begs the question, could a monarch ever truly rule in America again? Many people, both at home and abroad, have drawn correlations between the Holy American League and the various other Integeralist movements throughout the world. All of these movements contain similar values despite their vast cultural differences. The primary values in common are an ardent, patriotic nationalism, a strong empathies on Catholicism, and an intense antipathy for liberalism. Above all is a desire for societal and cultural restructuring around old world virtues under the guiding hand of a restored monarchy.\n\n The prospect of the American people accepting a return to Monarchy is, to put it mildly, hard to believe. Between the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence, and American history, it has been shown that Americans do not look on strongmen favorably. It is doubtful that Philip Carroll, given his faith and family lineage, would ever seek any kind of subservient accommodation with the royalists to our north, certainly not after the debacle in mainland Britain. At the same time, however, Murray, MacArthur and Long have proved that one man's strongman can be another man's savior.\n\n To this end, the greatest minds  of the Holy American League have gathered together in Congress at St. Mary’s City, the birthplace of American Catholicism, to consider the future of America. Already, several proposals to maintain some form of Republicanism has been rejected due to, as President Carroll aptly notes, being the ”spawn of a satanic ideology that was shown for what it truly was as the Weltkrieg burned almost all liberial democracies in Europe.”\n\n Only two of the proposals in this Congress have made any traction with the members assembled there. The first and perhaps most radical of these proposals is indeed the restoration of a monarchy, but not under any temporal king, rather the enthronement of Christ Himself as King of America.\n\n While the proposal is radical, it makes ense from a Catholic standpoint. The Universal Kingship of Christ is a little known teaching of the Catholic Church that states that ALL nations, regardless of creed, are under Christ's Kingship. Thus, enthroning Christ as King  would simply be a recognition of what is already the case.\n\nThe other proposal that is gaining traction also includes the recreation of a Monarchy, but under the House of Stuart, the last Catholic Royal House of England. This proposal, while also radical in its own right, makes sense in a geopolitical and historic sense. It is well known that enemy number one of the Holy League are the Windsors in Canada. By crowning their historical rival, we would legitimatize an invasion of Canada. From a historical standpoint, the Gunpowder Plot, our historical namesake, was a plot by British Catholics to destroy Parliament and restore the Stuarts. Thus, by crowning a Stuart, we could finish what they started.\n\nAs the First Congress of the Holy American League begins voting, it is clear that..."

unionstate.310.d:0 "In an event that left many Americans dumbfounded today, President Philip Acosta Carroll, Father Charles Coughlin, and the Holy American League led a joint declaration announcing that the American Union State would, indeed, be transitioning to a form of constitutional monarchy.\n\nThe astonishment of the majority of Americans, counter-intuitively, did not stem from the concept of an imperial America, but rather, the declaration from Carroll and Coughlin that none other than Jesus of Nazareth shall be coronated as King of American. As it stands, this new political policy has shocked millions, millions who expected a president, chairman, or dictator perhaps, but never a king.\n\nFurther, in a similarly confounding statement, Philip Carroll announced that he would, in fact, be resigning as the President of the United States, instead assuming the title of Regent. This would be acting in accordance with teachings of the Church, primarily for the purpose of overseeing the administration of this new American.\n\nReactions to this declaration have been, to put it mildly, perhaps as varied and mixed as they have ever been in the former United States: many Americans, even those among the Christian faithful, are flabbergasted at the notion of the apparatus of state being granted to an ethereal being in the form of the Judaic Son of God.\n\nMeanwhile, the markedly more outspokenly cynical critics of the Holy American League have openly denounced the move as a nakedly obvious and even delusional attempt to galvanize the religious population in America under the clerical dictatorship of Philip Carroll. How in God's name Carroll intends to legitimize this seemingly insane decision remains to be seen."

unionstate.311.d:0 "As part of Regent Carroll's initiative to facilitate America's transition into a Catholic state, the Holy America League has begun a series of restoration efforts of America's most major historical Christian sites. One such site of major import to Carroll's initiative is the site of Saint Mary's City, the original colony of Catholic settlers along the Chesapeake Bay. It is the first settlement of what would form the county and eventually, the state, of Maryland, and is credited as being the origin point of American values of religious freedom.\n\nIn the centuries since the American Revolution, Saint Mary's City now functions as little more than a tourist attraction: the descendants of the original settlers have long since moved on to the more populous regions such as Washington DC or Baltimore. Now, with the beginning of Carroll's initiative to reinvigorate the old colony, new construction projects for the development of the city are planned.\n\nThese are part of an economic plan based on an obscure Syndicalist-designed development scheme originally intended for the state of Nevada, but now it will be initiated in the former Maryland hamlet. The goal will be to utterly transform it into a shining gem in the heart of the Mid-Atlantic region, even though the initial estimates place the project's completion as late as 1954.\n\nIt is becoming clear to many, based on the sheer scale of the endeavor, that Regent Carroll is determined to make America into a nation as pious as it is prosperous. Something to be admired in something more than mantra, and if the plans for Saint Mary's City are any indication, America is likely going to look very different in the near future."

With the continued threat of the terrorism on the horizon, the American people are wary, and many Catholic converts have taken to forming citizen guards to protect rural communities from such opportunists.\n\n The irony of the situation was not lost on those they protected, as one might imagine; much of the suffering of Catholic Americans can be traced to the very Protestants or other groups they worked to protect. The rise in popularity of these AD-HOC militias, known to these rural communities as "Knight Watchers", might mark the beginning of real change in America; Catholic and Protestant Whites have been more supportive of one another than ever before, and many communities in the Midwest and Great Plains have found a semblance of peace in the ashes of a once great nation.\n\nWhile it will still take some work before America is restored to her previous glory, the role these Knight's Watchmen had to play wil not be forgotten."

The origin of the schism within the League stems from ex-socialist activist Dorothy Day and venerable New York governor Al Smith, both of whom still continue to work for the betterment of America, despite their necessary alignment with the comparatively extreme Integralists within the League.\n\n Day, whose mere presence within the League has been a point of contention since it's foundation, argues for transitioning the American economy to the model of Distributism. Distributism is a communal form of economic decentralization based on values of sharing and charity, where a country's production would be widely owned by the populace instead of by private enterprise.\n\n Naturally, such a measure of collectivization has scared the pants off many of the more moderate members of the League, Al Smith chief among them. Smith champions Christian Capitalism and argues that a free market is of vital importance to the American economy, even invoking Charles of Carrollton's role in the Revolutionary War as a principle argument in favor of the preservation of private enterprise.\n\n Not wanting to be mistaken as showing favoritism to either side, Philip Carroll has delegated the decision of which economic model to adopt to the dictation of Father Charles Coughlin, whose enmity for the leftist Day and liberalist Smith is well known, and would likely favor whatever economic plan he felt would be most practical for America's future."

What originally began with the Knight Watchers, those brave volunteers, devout in their adherence to God and fervent in the ideals of equality and solidarity with their countrymen, has rapidly blossomed into a multi-pronged phenomenon across the country. These groups have begun adopting the pledges, titles, iconography and customs of full-fledged Knightly Orders in the fashion of the old European crusaders.\n\nIn Maryland, the birthplace of the American Catholic, urban youths from Washington, Baltimore, and the resurgent Saint Mary's City have organized themselves around the personal teachings and mantra of Philip Carroll and his family line as part of the eponymous Knights of Doughoregan Manor. In New York City, the austere and indomitable African Americans from the five boroughs have chosen to honor the bravery of the Harlem Hellfighters with the official formation of the Brooklyn Brotherhood. In New England, throngs of haughty, red-haired Irish Americans have flocked to the patriotically self-styled Antitemplars in defiance of the decedent king in Canada. In the Steel Belt, once the heartland of the Syndicalist Menace, there have been a plethora of men and women from Chicago, Detroit, and Cincinnati, many of them medical workers, who have joined the new Red Hospitallers.\n\nA similar phenomenon has sprouted up in the American southwest, along the border states with Mexico, militias have founded the Old Sonora Charter in honor of the Cristeros. Along the Pacific Coast, what started with a number of white volunteers in Oregon and Washington soon began to incorporate a growing number of Native-America converts to defend the nation from internal and external threats in the stalword Order of the Heartland.\n\nAll of these groups of patriotic, pious soldiers, these modern day crusaders, have humbled Philip Carroll in their embrace of God's teachings, so much so that he has immediately enacted a decree to officially absorb these orders as an official part of the armed forces. They serve locally and abroad as a sterling example to all of the cultural unity and martial tenacity that God has brought them."

Naturally, despite the preservation of the democratic system, the news did not go over well with the majority of the nation, due in no small part to the nation's historical ardent opposition to monarchism. Despite the intense opposition to this move, the potential for Carroll to legitimize this move might lie with the chosen candidate for the League's new America.\n\n Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba,is the chosen pretender to the new American crown; once the Foreign Minister for the ailing King Alfonso, the amiable, affluent Spaniard is the most senior living descendant of King James II, whose devout faith in Catholicism lead to his unlawful exile. It also led to the rise of the House of Windsor, presaging the infamous Jacobite uprisings across Ireland and Scotland. Even today, there are some in Scotland who believe Jacobo to be the rightful heir to the Kingdom of Scotland.\n\nWhile this history might seem superfluous, there is a realpolitik reasoning for crowning a Stuart. Not only does supporting the Jacobite claims to the British Crown cunningly sidestep the role the monarchy itself had in the violent suppression of our ancestors, allowing the blame for said atrocities to be placed on the House of Windsor, but also do so in away that would garner support from the European-descended population in North America. Many Irish, Scottish and even Hispanic-Americans are finding cause with Carroll's Integralists in their alignment with the Celt-Iberian aristocrat, supporting the League's attempt at European inspired monarchism in a manner that is paradoxically pro-American. This trend of Americans supporting monarchy may be as unexpected as the Spanish Inquisition, but it is a welcome change, for we will need all the support we can get if we are to recover from the current crisis."

No where else is this more prevalent than in the economic debate, something that news reporters and journalists were spinning themselves in circles going over, It would be even more confusing had it not been that politically similar politicians have come together to represent their bases as a unified front in the debate.  The Reformists who wish to change or even get rid of the distributist economy to something more favor-some to their practice. The Moderates are fine with our current set up and wish to continue Phillips old system. While the  Hardliners want to centralize the economy, some are even going so far as to wish for a type of 'Feudalism with American Characteristics'"

cathdeath.4.t:0 "Holy American League Congress-Government Debate"
cathdeath.4.d:0 "While the economic debated was heated, both the reporters and even the politicians within the congress could not have seen the heat from the governmental debate coming. As the debate first begin and the first speaker, a woman from the Reformist faction, walked onto the podium they would not last but a minute until someone, believed to be a representative from the Inquisition’s side of the Hardliners, throw a shoe at them. While the shoe missed, it caused a great uproar, leading to the female representative being thrown out of the congress. Regardless,  the Reformists are championing a campaign in favor of decentralization, with some supporting the old federalist model while others seek an almost anarchistic approach to control. The Moderates want to return to that of a trusted system like the AUS had, with more or less populism depending on the person within the faction.The Hardliners are seeking a strong government with centralized control, so they can give power to either noble knights or that of the Inquisition's never-ending hunt for heretics."

cathdeath.4.c:0 "A stronger, harder government is the way"

cathdeath.5.t:0 "Holy American League Congress-Inquisition Debate"
cathdeath.5.d:0 "The debate has shifted to the rather controversial subject of the Inquisition. Many of the Empire’s citizens live in fear of the Inquisitors, and with good reason. The intense and brutal punishments dished out to those found guilty of heretical behavior or thought are now infamous. For this reason, the Reformists argue for doing away with what they deem to be an outdated, immoral, and unnecessary practice. Meanwhile, the Moderates advocate for toning down the excesses of the Inquisition while retaining the basic test of faith. In stark contrast to the other proposals, and much to the horror of most of their fellow party members, the Hardliners call for strengthening the Inquisition and removing the limits to its power. This would in effect give the Inquisitors free reign to hand out whatever punishment they pleased on whoever they pleased, but the Hardliners nonetheless insist it is a necessary step in cleansing the Empire into a truly Holy state more fit to bear the name of the Virgin. Now the Congress waits with bated breath to find out who shall get their way."

This seems to be a major victory for those who supported systems opposing the AUS in the civil war,even if they technically haven’t taken complete control they still managed to secure their foundation. for now at least. However they are far from unified, as the faction is still split between Al Smith's federalist christian base that supports a capitalist system and Day's anarchist distributists.

Soon enough, an Army Chaplain marches outside the congressional building and shouts to the crowds outside as loud as a pious man could, “THE MODERATES WIN!”.  The devoted crowds that support the old cause cheer as word spreads, however inside the congressional building there is one last vote. The vote that will decide whether Fulton Sheen, the man thought to surely succeed Carroll, or Charles Coughlin, The populist preacher that can bark up a storm of rhetoric for his populist cause. One by one the tallies are counted. "

Suddenly there is a single loud blurt from each radio set, and the Inquisition’s men begin cheering and clinking mugs and cantines together. While on the steps of the congressional building senior Knights of Columbus began patting and speaking to each other in congratulation. The announcement was silent yet no words were needed, The Hardliners had won.  The inquisition is now in charge of America.

As crowds loyal to their own factions begin dispersing into the city and back to their transportation, the police are already reporting multiple attacks between the groups. The Military is rapidly moving back to barracks outside the city limits or to reinforced checkpoints. While in the countryside nearly right after the announcement, partisan group activity is emboldening, with some even marching around in broad daylight.  Inside the congressional chambers members of the congress who are willing to form a unity government are racing to come to some kind of an agreement."

cathdeath.10.t:0 "Chaos in St. Mary's City"
cathdeath.10.d:0 "With the deadlock seeming to not be ending anytime soon, chaos is everywhere, most prevalent inside the capitol. The nation is on the verge of collapse as a mass exodus of people are leaving the city as conditions rapidly devolve with gangs and paramilitaries fighting each other in the slums of the city. The military is marching on the city, as their flight to their barracks proved to be a regrouping action rather than a true rout. The military commanders  are attempting to install Joseph P. Kennedy  Jr as Archregent, their motives seeming to only be inspired by a desire for order within the nation. With word spreading from frontline reporters of the hardline inquisition units firing on civilians loyal to any group rather than their own and lynch gangs from both the reformists and moderates seeking each other out, the military seems to be driving an almost reckless advance straight to the center of the city right through the ideologically inspired groups. The isolated members of congress who haven't fled are attempting to hash out an emergency deal. Front line reporters are trying to decipher what has happened?"

Congress having fled for their own lives or been killed in the chambers by the very knights protecting them, all the while our armies are deserting us en-masse for their own ideological reasons.

cathdeath.12.d:0 "Following the Empire's successful reclamation of our monarch's birthright, the British Isles, chaos has almost over taken our birthright. London, the former capital of the most powerful nation on earth is now but a burning husk, both from our own conquest and the unending riots engulfing the city. In order to help solve these problems, and ease the worries of his subjects, James III has decided to visit London, much to the chagrin of Regent Carroll. With his mind made up and his first true exercise of power in opposition to Carroll having been made, His Majesty has already charted a flight to London. Although Regent Carroll is obviously angry at His Highness, he has suggested  James heavily beef up security, as whispers of a plot to kill the King are apparently already afoot..."

cathdeath.13.t:0 "The King is Dead!"
cathdeath.13.d:0 "It appears the reported plot on the life of the King was correct. Following his arrival, James III was giving a speech in the ruins of Westminster when a lone gunman shot him in the head, killing him instantly. The gunman himself was shot down moments after shooting James III. With his death, another must take the throne, however his heir, María del Rosario Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, or simple Mary, has had questions regarding her suitability to the throne into question.\nOur fair queen-in-waiting, while undoubtedly the rightful heir to the throne of the Empire, is still but a child. While she is indeed over 18, her youth, and inexperience could be disastrous for us. This had lead many to consider another man, also a claimant to the Stuart throne, to be given the crown instead of the youthful Mary. This man is Rupprecht, of the House of Wittelsbach. An aging man, Rupprecht or Robert, is the King of Bavaria and is also seen as the more 'legitimate' claimant to the Stuart throne. Those who argue for Robert claim that not only will his experience in statecraft serve us better then Mary ever could, but his ties to the Kaiserreich could also come in handy for any future conflicts. While he is aging, he still is a healthy man, and still has at least a decade of life within him.\nThere are also those who wish for us to quietly end the monarchy, and maintain a regency, still recognizing the Stuarts as our rightful monarchs, but claiming the time is not yet ripe to crown a successor to James, not while the world is still burning. While of course we will have to decide what to do with the monarchy in the future, atleast for a few years we will be able to play dumb. The final decision, as always, goes to Regent Carroll who declares..."

Thankfully, agents of the Knights of Columbus were able to pin the man to the ground before he could get a single shot off! Following this close incident, James III has agreed to return home to Washington. Although not before a visit to the Scottish Highlands, where the brave Jacobite clans rose up against the protestant menace and fought to restore the Stuart's birthright.

cathdeath.15.d:0 "With the political maelstrom that followed the death of Archregent Carroll now beginning to subside, a new dawn has risen over this fine land. Serving as herald to this new dawn is none other than Dorothy Day, newly elected regent of this holy American empire. Famed for her work in Catholic circles as well as socialist ones, Day stands as the most liberal, left-leaning hierarch in the Empire. Under her guidance, the promised land that is America shall be blessed with the light of Catholic Socialism and communalism. Though many within the nation distrust her over her leftist views and ties to organizations such as the IWW, none can deny Day’s unyielding determination to reduce the plight of America’s downtrodden and poor. With the rest of the reformist wing of the Holy American League behind her, Day shall transform this war torn nation into a truly gleaming and prosperous city on a hill."
cathdeath.15.a:0 "No one has the right to sit down and feel hopeless. There is too much work to do."

cathdeath.16.t:0 "A Portrait of Day's America"
cathdeath.16.d:0 "As Archregent Day’s new legislation and reforms take effect, her vision for America has slowly begun to take shape. In a balanced, syncretic fusion of Socialist ideals and Catholic faith, Day’s agenda has already resulted in beneficial outcomes for the American people. Pious worker-priests hold sermons after their shifts end, Catholic-Socialist foodbanks, clothing deposits, and other charities are widespread, with many receiving direct subsidization from the state itself. Minorities and females have been given expanded rights, and social-welfare systems have been expanded greatly; all under the direction of Archregent Day and the rest of the Holy American League. Though many conservatives still fill the government, they have begun to soften their stance, if only minorly, towards the new Archregent as her policies prove their effectiveness over and over again. In this weird synthesis of Anarchism, Democratic Communalism, Socialism, and traditional Catholicism, America has truly found a unique governmental setup that seems to work for the majority of our citizens. Though far from perfect, Day’s new regime has put our nation well on the track towards full recovery from the horrors of war, famine, and civil strife. Whether or not this success continues, is up to Day and her allies."

cathdeath.17.t:0 "Smith’s Struggle for Democracy"
cathdeath.17.d:0 "Though the wound of Archregent Carroll’s death is still scarred into our people’s hearts and minds, our nation can not sit idly by in mourning forever. To this end, a new successor has finally been chosen to replace our martyred leader, and that new successor is none other than Al Smith. Long known for his piety, dedication to religious freedoms, and strict adherence to democratic traditions, Smith has won the day and is now in charge of the Empire. With the rest of the reformist wing within the Holy American League, Smith hopes to revive true federalism and democracy within the nation, returning to some semblance of normalcy when compared to the old American system now left to rot in its grave after the conclusion of the Second American Civil War. While his plans for federalism worries many within the League, especially our more conservative or zealous members, Smith has promised to adhere fully to the established soul of America, declaring he shall not lead our people into a dark and uncertain future, but instead to a warm and familiar destiny that has awaited the American people since our nation was first founded almost two centuries ago."
cathdeath.17.a:0 "The American people never carry an umbrella. They prepare to walk in eternal sunshine."

cathdeath.18.t:0 "Catholic Federalism"
cathdeath.18.d:0 "Through perseverance, determination, and perhaps even divine intervention, America has somehow not only managed to right its course, staving off further chaos, but has also managed to go further than any previous regime in the pursuit of bringing true democracy and liberty to our people. Smith has kept his word as the federalist structure of the old United States has been brought back from the brink of total death. Shedding the sins of the old regime’s past, certain changes to the original system have been made to ensure the nation’s continued piety and stability. For instance, the Constitution has surpassed its old standing of reverence and is now treated as a sacrosanct document, with some of its original writing being tweaked quietly behind closed doors to emphasize the latent pro-Catholic rhetoric the Holy American League claims has always been within the document’s subtext. The former United States have been transformed into a truly pious, virtuous, and liberal capitalist democracy while still maintaining its deeply conservative and traditional Catholic roots. Under Archregent Smith, this holy Empire’s future has never been more free and devoted to both Christian values and Federalist liberties."
cathdeath.18.a:0 "All the ills of democracy can be cured by more democracy."

cathdeath.19.t:0 "Restore the Parties?"
cathdeath.19.d:0 "Since the reign of our now martyred Archregent Caroll first began, political parties outside the Holy American League have been, in effect, completely muzzled. Forcefully absorbing the standing political parties such as the Democrats or Republicans, Archregent Carroll did so to preserve the fragile political system left in the wake of the horrific Civil War. Now, with a new Archregent ruling over these lands and the factionalist turmoil that split this nation apart now having subsided, the question over what to do with these illegalized parties has now resurfaced. The two main camps of argument that have formed over this debate are between the Reformists and other more liberal wings of the HAL, who advocate for a fully dismantling of the Holy American League’s oppositional coalition, while the more conservative camps, that decry this move as factionalism and an attempt to sow discord through out ranks. The final decision shall be up to the Archregent, with their decision holding the future of America’s democratic traditions in the balance."

But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you.’ These words, from the gospel of Matthew himself, ring true within our borders now more than ever. With the labors and works the Reformists of the Holy American League have put forth and endeavored upon, these former United States have never known such peace and prosperity. Arm in arm, our people march together towards their brighter future, with the Archregent holding the beacon of the Lord’s holy light for all Americans to bear witness to and follow. Together, the Meek have inherited the reigns of power."

cathdeath.21.d:0 "Fulton J Sheen has ascended to the highest position within our regime following the tragic death of the esteemed Archregent Carroll. Long having been Carroll's preferred and hand-picked choice to succeed himself should anything happen to him, Sheen has followed through on the late Archregent’s final wishes and now leads the Holy American League as the new Archregent of America. Hoping to carry Carroll’s torch, Sheen plans to complete Carroll’s unfinished vision for America, with some slight slants to a more democratic system; a move Sheen views as both necessary for stability, as well as being what is truly best for the American people. Like a new St. John carrying out the divine will of Carroll and the Lord, Sheen shall become the shepherd that leads this weary flock towards its destiny."

cathdeath.22.d:0 "’The treatise on Patriotism in the writings of the greatest philosopher of all times, St. Thomas Aquinas, is to be found under the subject of ‘Piety.’ This at first may strike as strange those who think of piety as pertaining only to love of God. But once it is remembered that love of neighbor is inseparable from love of God, it is seen that love of our fellow citizens is a form of piety.’ These hallowed, wise words warmly filled the airwaves of nearly every home in America as radios and televisions across the nation broadcast the weekly fireside chat from the beloved Archregent Fulton Sheen. ‘In these days when so many subversive activities are at work, a reminder of the necessity of loving our country is very much to the point. Consciously or unconsciously our citizens are grouping themselves around only a few possible ultimate answers to the questions vexing our country,’ the old soul carried on, like a caring father teaching his own kin, captivating the people of our great nation with his silver-tongued words on unity and praise. The highlight of tonight’s speech was his declaration on our task as Americans - ‘It is our solemn duty as Catholics, therefore, to be conscious of our duty to America, and to preserve its freedom by preserving its faith in God...’ With these strong words hanging in the air and within the thoughts of our people from coast to coast, Archregent Sheen bid his audience a farewell as he signed off until next week’s chat with his signature closing line:..."

cathdeath.23.d:0 "In the chaos surrounding the death of Carroll, one man has risen above all others to lead the country through these trying times. One man has the vision, the faith, and most importantly, the connections, to lead the country. That man is Father Charles Coughlin, and he has plans for the country now that he is the official Archregent. First and foremost, since Coughlin was affiliated with the original 'Share the Wealth' program, it seems he is interested in reviving it in one way or another. Just what this plan will entail is, as of yet, unknown, but what is known is that Coughlin's faith and conservatism are just what we need to stabilize the country."
cathdeath.23.a:0 "A return of America First?"

cathdeath.24.t:0 "America First!"
cathdeath.24.d:0 "From the beginning of his time as Regent, Father Coughlin always served the people. It was the common man, the farmer, the worker, the small townsman, that he worked and fought for. Now, having had the time to accomplish many of his most important proposals, the country has taken notice. For instance, Coughlin has campaigned for better workers wages and protections of unions, and in the meantime, his popularity has soared. However, the country has yet to fully recover from the Great Depression, and it seems that even Coughlin's programs have been unable to significantly improve the economy. So, while we live in uncertain times, the American people can sleep easy knowing Father Coughlin rules with their interests in mind, and with that knowledge, perhaps we can continue to rebuild."
cathdeath.24.a:0 "Put the people first!"

cathdeath.25.t:0 "A Test of Faith?"
cathdeath.25.d:0 "Few could have predicted that the United States of America would ever be a majority Catholic nation, but that is precisely what has occurred. The fallout from the Great Depression and then the Second Civil War left many looking for answers, for meaning, and for justice. In this atmosphere, millions turned to Catholicism as a source of strength, seeing their leaders and communities embrace it as well. However, as with any such mass conversion, it is unclear whether we can trust the veracity of these new converts. As such, perhaps certain tests are in order, so that we can better ascertain the faith of all Americans who profess to follow our faith. While the considerations for the test vary from asking Americans to pitch in to support the Church to seeing who is attending Mass, what we do know is that we must come up with some way to figure out who is true to the faith and who is not. At least, this is what some advisors argue. Others say that we have always been an open nation in terms of our faith, and that perhaps we should be magnanimous in our approach. After all, we are the majority faith now, and any attempts to force it on Americans may come off as weakness. What should we do?"

Extremists on both sides have attempted to steer his message one way or another for his own gain, with leftists attempting to use his message to implement socialism, while the right has tried to stonewall any proposals we have proposed. Regardless, the moderate supporters of Carroll have implemented his programs as best they could given the circumstances. Now, after so much time has passed, we can finally say that American is on a path to new greatness. We thank Long, we thank Carroll, and we thank our fellow Americans for their dedication in these times. Though we are still ravaged by economic devastation, among various other issues, we know that we Americans are pure of heart, and that is all we need."

cathdeath.27.d:0 "Martin Henry Carmody, holding the title of the Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, is an enigmatic man. His newfound control over the country has had little effect on the mystery surrounding him, but there is one thing he seems focused on above all others. What first began as a program to employ all Americans seems to have developed (or been revealed) as a philosophy of neofeudalism. While Carmody has always been 'the Knight', few could have predicted he would take his interest this far. With the help of his secret police forces though, Carmody has extended his influence -and vision- across the country. The man seems to have more influence than his public demeanor would indicate, and though these policies of societal cohesion and neofeudalistic economics seem radical, they are a welcome change for many who view the old American system as an abhorrent failure. However, some are questioning whether Carmody truly embodies the vision of Carroll, or if he is taking America in an entirely new direction. None can be sure just what will happen next."

cathdeath.28.d:0 "With Archregent Carmody's reign now firmly established, his dream of bringing feudalism, the best historical expression of political Catholicism in history, fully to the Americas is quickly becoming a reality. Due in part to the semi-feudalistic nature of Carroll's American Integralism, Carmody's feudalism, to the people of the Empire isn't really anything new. What is, however, is the increasing decentralization and efforts to find and empower 'those of noble blood.' Despite all his progress Carmody, always a man thinking of the future, is worried that his reforms will be all but overturned by generations to come. To nip this problem in the bud, Carmody has been considering crowning himself King of America. While seemingly an insane proposal, Carmody has justified himself to his Knight subordinates by saying that if he make himself King, the ideals of Feudalism could not be put down, as the Throne could do all it need to do to protect those ideals. Whenever the fact that Christ is already King is brought up, he further justified his augment by the example of the German Kaiserreich. He says just how the King of Prussia is the Emperor of the Germans, the King of America could be the Archregent of Christ who is King over the entire Empire. Unsound as his logic is, if Archregent Carmody goes ahead with his plan little could be done to stop him..."

Feeney, a conservative Jesuit and, most notably, a critic of the ideas of baptism of blood and baptism of desire, has taken the position of Archregent. Now, as the country stands at the precipice of a new era of religious conversion, Feeney prepares his inquisitors to carry out their most important task yet. They must ensure that all Americans are Catholics, and that those who are not loyal to the faith are ultimately snuffed out. It is no longer a question of whether or not this is necessary, for Feeney himself believes that a failure to adhere to the Church will lead to the failure of the nation as a whole. Of special concern are the nation's Jewish populations, who Feeney believes are perhaps the greatest danger of all to the Catholic Church."

America itself is undergoing a baptism, and the old religious tolerance Americans had been accustomed to has been wiped out entirely. Instead, inquisitors across the country seek out any non-believers, and lawmakers have taken action to snuff out these groups as much as possible. Heavy taxes have been levied on populations not publicly adhering to the Catholic faith, while outspoken Protestants, Jews, and others disappear, seemingly following mysterious visits from inquistiors. In many cases, such non-believers are tried in court and sentenced to prison time. However, in some rural areas, there has also been a revival of burnings at the stake to deal with various crimes ranging from sodomy to freemasonry. Such brutal punishments were unexpected, to say the least, but the inquisitors have carried out their task with ruthless efficiency, and now America is a more Catholic nation than ever, through the fires of war and devastation."

Giving the inquisitors more funding would certainly strengthen our attempts to convert the country to Catholicism, but it is unclear whether these men would be just in their treatment of non-believers.

Feudalism has also seen a resurgence amongst our more stoic supporters.

We need to do something or we risk falling apart, as one city is a fool's idea of control. Thus the discussion has grown upon our leaders and the peacemakers underneath them, should we just shoot everyone, as the countryside is full of hostile forces? This viewpoint although highly controversial as if it's even possible on the ground with our troops, is strongly opposed by the more calm-headed and peaceful aspects of our leadership. Those within this faction of our leadership think that as a Catholic nation the Word of God must first be used to restore order. "
cathdeath.33.a:0 "I have not come to bring peace but a sword"
cathdeath.33.b:0 "Peace shall be our weapon of choice"

cathdeath.34.t:0 "Aftermath of the Coup"
cathdeath.34.d:0 "Following the deadlock that nearly tore our Holy Empire to shreds, it was one man who stopped the chaos. It was one man who brought focus back, even if it was for a split second to the Congress. It was one man who saved the Empire. That man was Joseph Kennedy Jr, the Savior of America. Archregent Kennedy, despite just coming to power a short time ago, has already begun to make sweeping reforms to the Empire. Him and his 'National Cavilers' has started to transform the Empire into what amounts to a thinly veiled Junta. The Holy American League has effectively become a rubber stamp party in an already rubber stamp body. Those who oppose the will of the Archregent are silenced or worse. The military, long a neglected part of the Empire has become the central focus of Kennedy's reign. Despite his progress in stabilizing St. Mary's City and the capital, the rest of the nation is still in chaos from the deadlock. Unless the Archregent can restore order to the entire nation, he may just be removed himself..."
cathdeath.34.a:0 "Long Live the Savior!"

cathdeath.35.t:0 "Is Military Rule all that different?"
cathdeath.35.d:0 "The military rules everything and all radio stations in the capitol broadcast for the armed forces. But is anything really that different from Carroll's rule? Businessmen, Pastors and the tired skeptics who now wish for nothing more than to buy a grill and retire believe there is no difference. Same government authority, Same beliefs in Catholicism, albeit with a few more soldiers in the streets and more commendation bars on the officers."
cathdeath.35.a:0 "The Army or Carroll, who can tell the difference?"

cathdeath.36.t:0 "The Council of Guadalupe"
cathdeath.36.d:0 "The Congress..no..our entire nation, barely lived through the chaos of the deadlock. Now we rule together as the Council of Guadalupe. The Council is little more than an unending congress, made up of establishment and cooperative congressmen that acts as Regent to Christ as one body. It is definitely a peculiar system, however as long as we manage to not favor one side over another, and keep the Council happy and unified we can make it. It seems as if this system may just allow the Empire to not only survive, but thrive."
cathdeath.36.a:0 "Through compromise we shall survive"

cathdeath.37.t:0 "It Just Works"
cathdeath.37.d:0 "The nation breathes a sigh of relief as our system of compromise established  in the congress has managed to prove to be the bulwark required to keep peace in the nation. All the while the people seem to accept this decision, as a group of meek old men in a building hoping for peace is probably better than those who caused the chaos in the capitol. While there is still a fair bit of bickering in the congress, considering there are fewer radicals after the unfortunate chaos in the city that left many dead or missing, we have less to worry about."
cathdeath.37.a:0 "We move forward, into the future, hand in hand."

cathdeath.38.t:0 "Blessed Are The Peacemakers..."
cathdeath.38.d:0 "Our leaders all breathe a collective sigh of relief, for their work has paid off. Today the Empire is saved and we are now the peacemakers, those who stood in the face of disaster and emerged victorious. The Empire shall survive ten thousand years with the lessons we have learned from this crisis!"
cathdeath.38.a:0 "...for they shall be called children of God"

cathdeath.100.t:0 "Formation of the Red Legion of America"
cathdeath.100.d:0 "Following Archregent Day's rise to power, American politics were forever changed. While a devout Catholic, Day was an avid anarchist, and thus her rise legitimatized radical leftist politics. Despite this, many radical leftist groups, from the remains of the Combined Syndicalists to the Socialist Party of America to even the neigh defunct Communist Party of America were opposed to Day's vision of socialism, and thus begun working against her and her vision of socialism. Along with these groups, other fringe groups, such as the Sliver Legion and remnants of the Old Democratic Party also become more active, protesting against the rise of socialism in Day's personage. While these two groups have long been diametrical opposed, they were united in action against Day who they viewed as the ultimate threat. For the most part, this so-called unity was just an acknowledgement of the other's usefulness in opposing Day, for the time being at least. This changed today when, in Chicago, Archbishop Bernard Sheil, along with several prominent leaders from both the far-left and far-right of the anti-Day movement announced the creation of the Red Legion of America. Taking it's name from the old Sliver Legion that forms it's backbone, the Red Legion practices and preaches a strange and neigh contradictory ideology they call Red Legionarism or, as their motto puts it, 'Socialism for the White Man.' While normally this kind of thing would not be a massive threat, due to the Red Legion's uniting of both the far-left and far-right, it may just be a forced to reckoned with."
cathdeath.100.a:0 "Worrying, to say the least."

cathdeath.101.t:0 "The Red Legion attempts a coup!"
cathdeath.101.d:0 "Just a few short days after its creation, the Red Legion is already attempting to forcefully remove Archregent Day from power. All across the Empire, from Alaska to Argentina, Red Legion units are attempting to dislodge loyalist units from key urban centers. Thus far, they have already been able to wreasle control of Portland, Atlanta, and Mexico City. The fighting is intense, and no one is sure who will come out on top...."
cathdeath.101.a:0 "...the Red Legion succeeds! Long Live the Socialist Kingdom of God!"
cathdeath.101.b:0 "...the Red Legion is beaten back! Long Live Archregent Day!"

POLITICS_CHAD_KOC_KING_DESC:0 "Martin Henry Carmody, born in 1872, has been a faithful Catholic his entire life. Joining the Knights of Columbus at a young age he quickly became invested in its history as well as the faithful knightley servants of christendom, thus when he became its head knight in 1929, he started focusing on the study of history and recollections of old. When Phillip Caroll took power, Carmody quickly started trying to earn his support, which he did when Caroll selected the knights to be his own personal bodyguard. This new assignment seemed to have changed Carmody as he took it seriously, turning the knights assigned to his protection into a true protection detail as well as selecting recruits off total loyalty and honour. Soon this almost identical to old knight order had its part to play when after the sad passing of Caroll, the knights were a keen influential role in the hardliner faction. With his crowning as Martin I, King of America, it seems the task of bringing Fudealism to America has been completed. Despite this, the ever watching Knights appear to be growing even stronger, all to protect America's newfound status as the final bastion of Christendom."

POLITICS_ROBERT_STUART:0 "As the rightful claimant to the Stuart line, it was only natural for the now deceased James III’s throne to pass to the most-legitimate heir. Our new King has been crowned, and now Rupprecht Maria Luitpold Ferdinand, King of Bavaria, Duke of Bavaria, Franconia and in Swabia, Count Palatine by the Rhein, by the Grace of God, stands as the new King of America, King of England, King of Scotland, Emperor of the Imperium Britanniucm, and Defender of the Faith. This aging and experienced king, born in Munich in 1869, has lived a storied life as a veteran soldier and as a career aristocrat - a fitting background for such noble and honored king. With his ascension, the true line of the Stuarts once more has been returned its birthright."

POLITICS_MARY_STUART:0 "With the sudden death of her father, the young María del Rosario Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, 18th Duchess of Alba, by the Grace of God, has been coronated as Queen of America, Queen of England, Queen of Scotland, Empress of the Imperium Britanicum, and Defender of the Faith. Born in 1926 to the late King Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart and his deceased wife, the Doña María del Rosario de Silva y Gurtubay, Duchess of Alba de Tormes, 9th Marquise of San Vicente del Barco, Grandee of Spain, Queen María is by birthright the true heir of the Stuart line - a true descendant of the honored James II and a Stuart by blood. This purple-blooded royal, however, is but a inexperienced young socialite, and still woefully inexperienced in the art of statecraft, but with the aid of her trusted advisors, the Holy American League, and the honored Archregent Carroll, this young Queen may be just the darling America needs to bring popular support to our young monarchy. May she be the central rallying figure of our fractured people while we seek to rebuild our nation as America crowns its first Queen."

POLITICS_STUART_REGENCY:0 "With the King dead and his daughter María currently too young to take the throne, a regency council has been set up by Regent Carroll and the Holy American League. Under this new system, the Regent effectively rules the nation as a benevolent dictator in the stead of the young Princess María, though this reality of who is in control is barely hidden. Through a thin, minimally maintained facade, Regent Carroll controls every aspect of the American government, pulling the strings of this pious and blessed Empire to pursue his own ends - and  all from behind the shadow of a young girl. Until the time María is old enough to take the throne, this Holy Empire shall be run from the not-too-dark shadows of Carroll’s regency, though many within the nation feel as though this day shall never truly come, and that the Regent plans to solidify power fully for himself, though Carroll himself has tried to put these fears to rest as best he can. Regardless of his intent, the Regent’s word is final, and his decrees might as well be divine providence, for the Regent and his regency now rule America without obstacle."

POLITICS_CARROLL_STUART_REGENT_DESC:0 "While the Monarch is nominally the head of state of America, it is clear to all where the true power of government is held. Philip Acosta Carroll, war hero and head of the Holy American League, is the true linchpin of power in America. Appointed Regent (the direct successor to the former office of President) by James III as his first official act, Regent Carroll has sworn he will do anything and stop at nothing to correct the course of America, for the better."

POLITICS_CHRIST_THE_KING_DESC:0 "Following one of the most controversial political decisions in modern history, Jesus of Nazareth has officially been crowned as King of America. This title means very little in actual practice. After all, to truly exercise His authority as King of America would require the literal Second Coming, an event that will bring about the very end of politics. In reality, Christ's Kingship over America is little more then a thinly veiled attempt by the Holy American League to justify their Political Catholicism and Authoritarianism. If Christ's Kingship turns out to be little more then cover for a horrid dictatorship or the beginning of a truly brighter future for America remains to be seen."


POLITICS_HOLY_AMERCIA_DESC:0 "The Holy American Regency Council was birthed in the chaos of St Mary’s city. As the very congress held to decide who would succeed our beloved Caroll soon devolved into a crowd throwing shoes at one another, there were a few who saw the potential danger this possessed. So as their predictions turned true and the city devolved into infighting between power hungry factions, These truly blessed congressmen formed together and decided that only in unity may the nation survive. Now these congressmen lead the nation together in a council that decides the fate of the nation, and as long as they stand they shall not allow chaos on America’s door ever again."

POLITICS_REGENT_JOE_DESC:0 "Joseph P Kennedy Jr was born July 25th 1915. Born to the rising Kennedy family, his father groomed him to be a future politician, The first Roman catholic President. However duty calls, and when America broke out in a violent civil war he signed up for service with Catholic troops in the Union state rather than stay in the relatively calm New England. This proved to be a good decision as the catholics would soon pave the way to being the rulers of america, with Kennedy having made a name for himself. Serving evermore with the military, he would have simply continued on had it not been for the political chaos in St Mary’s City. Not allowing Political ambitions to result in the collapse of this Catholic state, Kennedy led the military units outside to capture the capitol and restore order. And never again will corrupt politicians and their bands of followers threaten order."

POLITICS_CHAD_KOC_DESC:0 "Martin Henry Carmody, born in 1872, has been a faithful Catholic his entire life. Joining the Knights of Columbus at a young age he quickly became invested in its history as well as the faithful knightley servants of christendom, thus when he became its head knight in 1929, he started focusing on the study of history and recollections of old. When Phillip Caroll took power, Carmody quickly started trying to earn his support, which he did when Caroll selected the knights to be his own personal bodyguard. This new assignment seemed to have changed Carmody as he took it seriously, turning the knights assigned to his protection into a true protection detail as well as selecting recruits off total loyalty and honour. Soon this almost identical to old knight order had its part to play when after the sad passing of Caroll, the knights were a keen influential role in the hardliner faction. Now with the Knights having won the power struggle, they seem to be dead set on their goals of a truly nostalgic return to God’s Christendom."

POLITICS_FEENEY_DESC:0 "Leonard Feeney, Born Feb 18, 1897 has always been a strict jesuit, believing that anything other than an exact interpretation of the catholic doctrine was a gateway to hell. With his belief in strict catholic ideals and distrust towards non catholics, Phillip Caroll saw fit in putting him to the position of Leader of the American Inquisition. With this new found power Feeney immediately got to work in putting down partisan groups that opposed the new catholic order, and helping put an inquisitorial watch over the “baptization of America”. He always made sure inquisition had a watch on the newly christened catholics of america as he was sure some were hidden wolves in the sheep herd, and then with the passing of Caroll, he voiced these concerns more than ever. Now with the trust of the Congress granting him power over the nation, Feeney and the Inquisition will end these dangers as they have all the power, with none to oppose them."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_CHARLES_DESC:0 "Charles Coughlin was born on october 25th, 1891. He has become a very notorious father within America as he has been a very charismatic speaker with his utilization of radio broadcasts for both catholic messages as well as some more heated controversial topics involving his views on the economy and minorities. His views towards helping American families eventually brought him into tow with the America First party under Huey long. While he considered himself a proud member of the party and it’s ideals, he was first a catholic, And thus he tipped his hat in with Phillip Caroll’s league after the success of the gunpowder plot. Now years later he has proven himself worthy in the eyes of the league, nominating him as leader of the nation. Perhaps this fire-spoken father is what our nation needs."


POLITICS_FULTON_SHEEN_DESC:0 "Fulton John Sheen, Born in May 1895. Fulton made a name for himself with his teachings and being a well spoken preacher on the radio to catholic America. Although not as well known as Coughlin, this humble bishop had served as a servant to Catholics all across America with his teachings at the Catholic university and representation of them. This service and representation put him into the sight of Caroll who assigned him to his cabinet and had him continue to be the loyal preacher to the rapidly changing America. Now with the passing of Christ's regent Fulton Sheen has once again proven himself worthy in the eyes of the Holy American League who put their faith in him as Caroll’s successor. Sheen now has a lot of decisions on his plate, however keeping the spirit of Caroll’s America is his main goal, for blessed are the pure of heart."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_SMITH_DESC:0 "Many politicians profess a desire for reform or pretend to crusade against corruption in all forms, but only a select few politicians both hold true to these promises while also becoming successful, efficient, and prominent while doing so. Archregent Al Smith is one such politician - a rare unsullied gem amid a sea of wolves and schemers. Born in 1873 in Manhattan to a working class Catholic Irish immigrants, Smith got a start into politics young by falling in with ‘Silent’ Charlie Murphy and the Tammany Hall group. It was in these young years that Smith solidified his reformist ideals and love for the working man - a foundation that would fuel his explosive career to new heights. Long dominating New York’s political stage as a member of the infamous Tammany Hall political machine that helped his rise and later as a leader the successful Efficiency Movement aimed at reforming the legislation that was leading his state to decay, Smith had become as famous nationwide for being one of the only successful Catholic politicians has he had been for his unending slew of successful legislation. Now, as Archregent, Smith has cast off the doubters who once whispered that the Pope would dictate his every whim, for no being or mantra guides Smith in his policy other than his dual faiths in good, honest governance and the Lord."


POLITICS_CATHOLIC_DAY_DESC:0 "Few have been able to balance a deep sense of socialist justice while still holding true to pure Christian principles as well as now-Archregent Dorothy Day. Born into a middle class Anglo-Irish family in Brooklyn in 1897, Day’s own religious awakening was brought on by her own reading, practice, and study; her parents being nominal Christians at best, driving Day to find God in her own way. After this Christianity-fueled interest consumed her childhood, Day spent her adolescence living the Bohemian dream, traveling across the nation as a journalist and vagabond, picking up new influences and ideas as she bounced from one Christian sect and Socialist ideology to another in her quest to find herself. After over a decade of soul-searching, as well as dealing with the trials of new motherhood, the American Civil War, and balancing her loyalties to her Socialist contacts in the IWW and her episcopal contacts in the former-Union State, Day has grown into one of the most unique and tempered political leaders in the Holy American League. Though many still distrust her Socialist sympathies, all true believers know Day’s love of Socialism comes not from a love of dusty, dated theory, but from seeing it as the loving, egalitarian will of the Lord himself. She shall be the prophet that shows America the light of true, non-bastardized Socialism - a Socialism bathed in God’s glory and tempered through piety."

POLITICS_JACOBO_F_J_STUART:0 "Born the 17th of October 1878, Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart, 17th Duke of Alba, now James III of America, has achieved a position he never even dreamed he would have. Before he assumed the long vacant throne of America, Jacobo had lived a fairly exciting life. He had been the Foreign Minister of Spain until 1931, an art collector and even an Olympic Medalist, wining a silver medal in polo at the 1924 Olympic Games in Berlin. On 7 October 1920 he married Maria del Rosario de Silva, 9th Marchioness of San Vicente del Barco. The two of them have had one daughter, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart, Jacobo's heir-apparent.\nWhen Jacobo first received the letter inviting him to assume the throne of America, he was shocked. While he was the senior Jacobite claimant, he had never pushed the claim and he never expected to the claim to come into play, let alone in a breakoff colony that had been burning with the fires of Republicanism and anti-Catholicism since it's foundation. Yet here he is, King over a nation none ever thought would have a king again.\nAlthough he has been crowned, Jacobo has little to no power, as he was 'encouraged' by the same man who gave him the crown to give power over to him. Although Jacobo is clearly just a powerless figurehead, he has taken to his new role excellently, appearing in public almost everyday, be it giving speeches, appearing along side Regent Carroll or simply going for a walk with his family. While he may be a glorified rubber stamp for the Holy American League, Jacobo Fitz-James Stuart clearly loves his people, and they love him in return."

TEX_CLAIRE_LEE_CHENNAULT_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 6, 1890, in Commerce, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Claire Lee 'Old Leatherface' Chennault began his military career when he joined the Reserve Officers' Training Corps while he attended the Louisiana State University. He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."
TEX_DADDY_COLLINS_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joseph Lawton 'Lightning Joe' Collins began his military career in 1913 when he joined West Point thanks to an alternate appointment his uncle Martin Behrman, the major of New Orleans at the time, managed to get him at the age of 17 and graduated as an infantry second lieutenant in 1917. He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. \n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."
TEX_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel."
TEX_WILLIAM_SIMPSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 18, 1888, at Weatherford, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In June 1905, a month after turning 17, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated four years later in June 1909, being commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch. Simpson's first assignment was with the 6th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lincoln, North Dakota. Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."
TEX_JACOB_DENVERS_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 8 September 1887, in York, Pennsylvania, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Devers began his military career when Congressman Daniel F. Lafean offered him an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 1906 and graduated on 11 June 1909 as an artillery second lieutenant. Devers' first posting was to the 1st Battalion, 4th Mountain Artillery in Washington and for his next assignment in late 1912, Devers was sent back to West Point to teach mathematics. On 1 April 1916, he was promoted to first lieutenant and he was transferred to the newly activated 9th Field Artillery at the Schofield Barracks in Hawaii and promoted to Captain in early 1917. In May 1919, Devers was sent on a three-month temporary duty assignment to study the Weltkrieg in Europe. He attended the Preußische Kriegsakademie in Berlin to study the equipment and tactics used by both sides during the Weltkrieg. He was promoted to major on 1920 and he was later selected to attend the Command and General Staff School, graduating in 1925. He was then posted to Fort Sill as the director the Field Artillery School's Gunnery Department until 31 August 1929 where Devers was transferred to Washington, D.C., to serve on the staff of the Chief of Field Artillery. In 1932, he was chosen to attend the Army War College and graduated on June 1933. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 26 February 1934. With the country spiraling into Civil War, Devers found himself fighting more and more against his superiors inability to react to internal issues, starting a deep rivalry between him and Dwight Eisenhower, even putting him at odds with his old friend Leslie McNair. When Huey Long declared the Union State, Devers decided that MacArthur and his staff was a liability for America, and promptly volunteered for the AUS officer corp, where he was promoted to Field Marshal along with Terry De La Mesa Sr."
TEX_TERRY_DE_LA_MESA_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 1 April 1888, in Fort Douglas, Utah, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Allen was born into a family with a long tradition of military service. His grandfater, Colonel Carlos Alvarez de la Mesa, was a Spanish immigrant who fought for the Union in the Civil War. His father, Colonel Samuel Allen, also served in the military. In 1907, Allen was appointed to West Point in New York. Eventually, this would end in failure primarily due to a stutter, and Allen was kicked out of the school. However, after a successful education at the Catholic University of America, he got a second chance at a military career, and become a second lieutenant of the U.S. Cavalry assigned to Fort Myer, Virginia. Over the years, he has slowly climbed the ranks, and a freak accident that saw him shot in the jaw caused his stutter to disappear. While moving up the chain of command, Allen continued his military education at various institutions, from the U.S. Army Cavalry School and U.S. Army Command School, both in Kansas, to the U.S. Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia. He would continue his career as an instructor and eventually met George C. Marshall Jr., who promoted him to the rank of brigadier general. Though he skipped the rank of Colonel that his familial predecessors had had, he did not mind, his focus being on the battlefield first and foremost. In fact, many have compared him to General George S. Patton in his approach to warfare, as his aggressive style and colorful style make him very similar to the more famous man. However, the two differ outside of those factors, as Allen cares little for his appearance and more for tactics, emphasizing night assaults and unpredictable plans. His confident, efficient style of leadership has given him one of the most promising careers in the U.S. Army. Or it did, until 1936, when Major General Omar Bradley clashed with Allen and caused Allen to flee west to the familiar state of Texas, where he had met his wife and served some of his first years of military service. There, he joined Huey Long's cause, and Long, recognizing his talent and high rank, immediately promoted him to the rank of Field Marshal alongside Jacob Denvers."

He graduated from the academy in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. Ridgway was first assigned to patrol duty in the Mexican border with the 3rd Infantry Regiment, where he reached the rank of Captain and would return to West Point in 1920 as a Spanish teacher. In 1925, Ridgway graduated from the United States Army Infantry School, after which he was sent to the American Legation in Tianjin and later sent to Nicaragua, where he was one of the American COs trying to supervise the 1927 elections. In 1930, he'd be transferred to the Philippines, where he became an advisor to the Governor-General of the islands and would return to America in 1933 as a Major. He'd graduate from the Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and was attending the Army War College in Pennsylvania before the Civil War broke out. With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government.

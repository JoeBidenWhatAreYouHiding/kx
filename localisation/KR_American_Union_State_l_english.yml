### Huey Long Path ###
TEX_new_washington:0 "The New Washington"
TEX_new_washington_desc:0 "The new American seat of government will throw off the old shackles of Capitoline tradition and rebuild itself as a defensible and secure location for the three branches to seat power. Boulevards are now too wide for barricades, structures are now supplied with emergency power, and shelters are guaranteed for residents."
TEX_root_out_out_traitors:0 "Root out Traitors"
TEX_root_out_out_traitors_desc:0 "Following the trail of convicted traitors, the president has found a group of Congressmen that were in contact with business executives planning against us. Although they are now behind bars, some have eluded capture through political avenues. We are investigating whether the captured Richard Butler in his asylum will lead us to any more traitors."
TEX_expand_the_minute_men:0 "Expand the Minutemen"
TEX_expand_the_minute_men_desc:0 "In order to preserve the integrity of our armed forces, we must expand the Minutemen into the field of civil protection and border monitoring. The insurgent socialists and MacArthurites don't adhere to the rules of engagement anymore, therefore we must prepare for any level of brutality on their part."
TEX_election_monitoring:0 "Election Monitoring"
TEX_election_monitoring_desc:0 "The only force that can ensure the democratic process is carried out is the Minutemen, who shall be deployed every November to safeguard voting areas from harm.

TEX_destroy_the_klan:0 "Destroy the Klan"
TEX_destroy_the_klan_desc:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and his cadre of his Grand Wizards are finally arrested and brought to trial for their terroristic actions. Murders, lynchings, and voter intimidation is being brought against this most dangerous group of traitors. With their conviction we have finally pacified the most extreme that sought to poison the America First Party."
TEX_ensure_loyalty:0 "Ensure Loyalty"
TEX_ensure_loyalty_desc:0 "Members of Congress have devised a way to establish a baseline of trust in our democratic system that is sorely needed. The so-named Fish Act would require every party representative, labor union leader and public servant to sign an affidavit stating that they will never aid the CSA or MacArthur junta."
TEX_reward_loyalty:0 "Reward Loyalty"
TEX_reward_loyalty_desc:0 "The Fish Act's critics rightfully stated that there was no incentive for officials to sign the affidavits. In response a second Act is passed to provide compensation for the time spent in the public service during the Civil War that was postponed by the Federalists. This back-pay would require signing the aforementioned affidavit, of course."
TEX_national_political_machine:0 "National Political Machine"
TEX_national_political_machine_desc:0 "Executive acts have been used to create agencies to serve the American people in the past, so long as it does not intrude into state sovereignty. In the past, this power has led to corruption from corporate interests. The president is, however, incorruptible. Turning the tables against the monopolies and grafters is his promise to America."
TEX_new_democracy:0 "New Democracy"
TEX_new_democracy_desc:0 "New Democracy is a new social contract between the American people and leadership. New Democracy promises a politician that will work in his constituents’ interests through adversity, even through violence. Loyalty to your constituents will be rewarded until every man is a king."

TEX_peoples_commission_desc:0 "Inspired by the judicial districts of Louisiana, the president has created a para-legal representative entity called the Peoples Commission.

TEX_every_man_a_king:0 "Every Man a King"
TEX_every_man_a_king_desc:0 "What began as a dream and lifted from a motivational book by Orison Swett Mardin, Every Man a King is now a political reality. It is positive thinking and the end of pessimistic greed that caused the Great Depression that will save America. Following Huey Long's economic and social plans to transform America and rewrite the political landscape."
TEX_for_the_poor_man:0 "For the Poor Man"
TEX_for_the_poor_man_desc:0 "Now the president has brought to Congress legislation to furnish a homestead allowance of 1/3rd the average wealth. A guaranteed annual income of $2000 and old-age pensions is ready to be distributed to loyal Americans. Until such a time when the proper income tax changes are made, these benefits are coming out of the National Treasury."
TEX_populist_education:0 "Education for the Masses"
TEX_populist_education_desc:0 "Across this great nation there are millions more children struggling to resume normal life and facing a future no better than that of their parents without education. President Long has approved the bill Congress sped through to rebuild schools and reopen colleges for Americans in need."
TEX_road_map_for_the_future:0 "Roadmap for the Future"
TEX_road_map_for_the_future_desc:0 "The expenses the president has taken out for Every Man a King requires a fundamentally different means of tax collection and public financing to sustain itself. Therefore, President Long has laid out a road-map to plan out spending for the next four years of his term and milestones that America should cross."
TEX_national_youth_adminstration:0 "National Youth Administration"
TEX_national_youth_adminstration_desc:0 "The orphans of the Civil War need not only education to uplift themselves, but discipline as well. A visit to Boys Town near Omaha Nebraska has inspired President Long to create the National Youth Administration. A work training and activism group for young Americans that gives orphans a place to stay and trains them in important life skills."
TEX_share_the_wealth:0 "Share the Wealth"
TEX_share_the_wealth_desc:0 "It has come time for the rich that helped plunge America into civil war to pay. No person will be allowed to accumulate more than 300 times the annual income. Incomes are capped at $1 million, and inheritances capped at $5.1 million. President Long will prove the newspapers who decried him wrong."
TEX_imperial_presidency:0 "Imperial Presidency"
TEX_imperial_presidency_desc:0 "With traitors uprooted and exposed, public opinion polls show an overwhelming support for President Long's re-election. Unrestrained by pressure to conform or be threatened by members within the AFP, the president has begun what many are calling his 'imperial presidency'. The two-term limit is respectfully discarded until a lesser man is in charge."
TEX_fire_with_fire:0 "Fight Fire with Fire"
TEX_fire_with_fire_desc:0 "The ideological fight against the political and social enemies of America has been done thus far with welfare and incentives. Now President Long is ready to pull punches against the social resistance to Share the Wealth. We must use every measure possible to stop the boat of the nation from turning over."
TEX_perfect_democracy:0 "Perfect Democracy"
TEX_perfect_democracy_desc:0 "The original Constitution set out to create the perfect union in America. This union failed, America died, but through President Long it was saved. The president and the American people have agreed that the Constitution is now a document to build a more perfect democracy. The uninterrupted will of the American peoples as exerted by its leaders."
### George Van Horn Moseley Path ###
TEX_the_business_plot:0 "The Business Plot"
TEX_the_business_plot_desc:0 "In order to keep the reputation of the War Powers Committee away from the public eye, we have chosen to extend the facade of the 'Arsenal of the Republic' into the new America. The saved United States will return to the fundamental values of our Founding Fathers, and clearly say to the world that America is a Republic, not a Democracy."
TEX_use_the_fbi:0 "Use the FBI"
TEX_use_the_fbi_desc:0 "J. Edgar Hoover understands the needs of the new American Republic to safeguard against syndicalists. Cooperation of the FBI is also popularly received as it signals stability. We can trust the FBI to look in all the wrong places for Huey Long. If J. Edgar ever steps out of line, his relationship with Clyde Tolson will be public knowledge."
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act:0 "New Alien and Sedition Acts"
TEX_alien_and_sedition_act_desc:0 "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
TEX_cointelpro:0 "COINTELPRO"
TEX_cointelpro_desc:0 "The success of the New Aliens and Sedition Act has allowed us to identify several non-political and religious organisations with known syndicalist members. These groups will be monitored under the new COINTELPRO program, a the first fully empowered counterintelligence program capable of monitoring communications between group members."
TEX_purge_dissidents:0 "Purge Dissidents"
TEX_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee. They are welfare Longists, anti-progress religious fundamentalists, and mutualists. We are prepared to arrest every ground member and have prepared to export certain as-of-yet untouchable politicians who support these dissidents."
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination:0 "Office of Policy Coordination"
TEX_office_of_policy_coordination_desc:0 "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favour through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and directly sabotage. The OPC will enable us to softly muscle out radicals and indignant federalists that wish to re-enter the US government on their terms."
TEX_the_black_chamber:0 "The Black Chamber"
TEX_the_black_chamber_desc:0 "Another safety objective is to revitalize the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
TEX_american_nationalism:0 "American Nationalism"
TEX_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances. The cascade of failure that was epitomized by Hoover and turned over by Huey Long is now fertile for our country to replant American Nationalism."
TEX_the_american_legion:0 "The American Legion"
TEX_the_american_legion_desc:0 "The end of Huey Long would have ended in disaster if not for the brave veterans of the American Legion. It was the American Legion under Moseley that stood tall when public hysteria grew against syndicalists. It was also the American Legion that convinced Huey Long's Minutemen bodyguards to take that necessary detour."
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "Control the Boy Scouts"
TEX_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "Patriotic youth organisations have existed in Europe for decades. Our own Boy Scouts of America are an untapped well of support for the country to encourage loyalty in Americans subtlety. The War Powers Committee authorizes the appropriation of the Boy Scouts facility to educate and foster true Republicanism."
TEX_fordism:0 "Fordism"
TEX_fordism_desc:0 "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management. To thank our Committee member Ford, we have granted him the intellectual property over the assembly line method, as well as promoted it in publications."
TEX_american_capitalism1:0 "American Capitalism"
TEX_american_capitalism1_desc:0 "Our country is a capitalist nation, and through the War Powers Committee we can revitalize the age of progress that dissidents and populists intended to destroy. Through our loyal Congressmen, Business Councils will be formed again in the Capitol, taxes will be lowered, and the stock market will be made safe from terrorism."
TEX_capitalist_education:0 "Create the ESMWT"
TEX_capitalist_education_desc:0 "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralize technological changes. Instead of cooperation that would disrupt competition and give an unfair advantage to certain businesses, this program disburses its findings freely to the public."
TEX_captains_of_industry:0 "Captains of Industry"
TEX_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost. We should push through Congress a new income tax bracket for those earning more than $10 million dollars annually. With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."
TEX_industrial_security_act:0 "Industrial Security Act"
TEX_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "The need for work-site security has never been greater. The average working man is besieged by syndicalist infiltrators, Longist provocateurs, and federalist malcontents. We need to authorize the use of strikebreakers and integrate our loyal American Legionaries into the new National Guard so as to quickly respond to industrial sabotage."
TEX_pass_nira:0 "National Labor Control Act"
TEX_pass_nira_desc:0 "A permanent solution to the labor crisis has presented itself in the form of then executive order by Moseley to set up a national labor control bureau. The NLRB will remedy unfair labor practices by both unions and business owners. The impartial wording of the agency has received widespread support from third parties."
TEX_red_scare:0 "Red Scare"

This is the beginning of a new America."
TEX_the_silver_legion:0 "The Silver Legion"
TEX_the_silver_legion_desc:0 "The Silver Legion is currently the unofficial head of the American Legion, with propaganda delivered slowly through agents.

TEX_protecting_our_race:0 "Revive Nativism"
TEX_protecting_our_race_desc:0 "The foundations of America as Pelley and Armstrong see it are connected not only to the former nation of Britain, but to Anglo Saxons as a race.

TEX_segregation_forever:0 "Segregation Forever"
TEX_segregation_forever_desc:0 "Our inability to stop protesters from returning each day despite the beatings and the bullets proved to be an intriguing challenge.

TEX_christian_commonwealth:0 "Christian Commonwealth"
TEX_christian_commonwealth_desc:0 "Pelley's grand vision of the American Commonwealth is a country free of debt and bonds by turning the entire government into a gigantic corporation.

Now the public shall know of this danger."

TEX_christian_service_brigade:0 "Christian Service Brigade"
TEX_christian_service_brigade_desc:0 "What began as a volunteer organisation for young boys during the Civil War has now become a nationally funded organisation, The Christian Service Brigade.

In our time of need we were given a leader to rally behind, one who would save us and our values. After a cunning plan devised by our leader, we were able to get rid of Long and his lackeys in a single moment.

Christian Socialist Dorothy Day has outlined her plan for what she calls “Distributism”, which has garnered support from Catholic Workers but has been compared to Syndicalism. Al Smith on the other hand has outlined his “Christian Capitalism” plan, which is exactly what it sounds like, this plan has garnered support as well but has been compared to the vile Liberalism that destroyed old America.

Old guard leader Francis Townsend advocates for Share Our Wealth to remain a non-governmental entity to prevent partisan politics, while McMath wishes to officiate it as a Federal Department."
unionstate.15.a:0 "Side with Townsend."
unionstate.15.b:0 "Side with McMath."

unionstate.16.t:0 "McTeague released in theaters"
unionstate.16.d:0 "A tale of greed and betrayal that once littered America is now encapsulated in the new film McTeague. A social commentary by director Erich von Stroheim about the corrupting power of wealth is seen by many as a parable to the state of America before the Civil War. This massive four-hour epic film had it's ending altered from the original book, where a kind stranger intervenes in the death struggle of McTeague and whisks him away from Death Valley back to civilisation."

How should we respond?"

This latest series is the brainchild of Siegel and Shuster partnered with an anti-Klan advocate Stetson Kennedy. This tale has successfully embarrassed the illegal organisation further after Pelley's downfall to the point of desertion."
unionstate.18.a:0 "Kids love it."

unionstate.19.t:0 "Governor Long Fires on Protesters"
unionstate.19.d:0 "Governor Earl Long has long dodged accusations of corruption and mismanagement of money. As the brother of President Huey Long, Earl has been immune from prosecution and is usually handled delicately by the press. Earl's administeration has been charged to distribute veteran benefits and basic income to the people of Louisiana, with the assumption that all loyal Americans would be deserving of this welfare. A group of concerned citizens, including hundreds of veterans and poor from Norther Louisiana have gathered in Baton Rouge, claiming that Earl Long has withheld their income and benefits. Governor Earl tried to speak to the crowd, claiming that the funds have yet to arrive from the capitol, and to disperse until that day. The protesters, many of whom were black veterans, began chanting for Earl's resignation. While accounts differ about what happened next, anywhere from 20-50 people lie dead among the protesters. It now lies with President Huey to pick up the pieces. Governor Earl is appealing to his brother to help him with damage control. The press are not quite at a fever pitch, and any move Huey does could swing public opinion at the moment. "
unionstate.19.a:0 "Attend the funerals of the protesters."
unionstate.19.b:0 "Help Earl cover this up."

unionstate.20.t:0 "Black No More"
unionstate.20.d:0 "The imaginations and political opinions of Americans were piqued when Black No More, written by author George Schuyler, appeared on bookshelves. The book is a science fiction about a scientist who invents a machine that can turn a black man white. This invention turns society upside down, and challenges ideas on race and the one drop principle. The book continues with the revelation that all the characters, both white and black, are mixed race, and the entire principle of racial supremacy collapses. While there were concerns that the book would be censored due to its veiled attacks against both white supremacists and black leaders, it appears that President [TEX.GetLeader] enjoys the book."

In attendance was the Vice President and Huey's brother, Earl Long, who had been filling in as President Long for the past few weeks, has been Inaugurated as President to finish Huey's remaining terms. While America apparently mourns their leader's loss, The US governments in exile have continued their claims that Huey's government is illegitimate."

### Business Plot Events 31 - 50 ###

unionstate.31.t:0 "The Hollywood List"
unionstate.31.d:0 "We know that Hollywood has always acted above the law. It's mere existence in California an attempt to dodge intellectual property laws. Moreover, it is no secret that some artists there had hoped for a syndicalist victory over our great American Republic. Their folly must be exposed and their sedition prosecuted."
unionstate.31.a:0 "We'll film their trials."

unionstate.32.t:0 "Persistence of Antisemitism"
unionstate.32.d:0 "With the great success of Fordism in America, there comes as well some critics of the ideas presented in Ford literature. Especially within the Dearborn Independent, articles describing a massive worldwide conspiracy of Jews has created backlash against Fordism. The public at large is beginning to question Ford's aging logic, and as Ford is not a very public man, his responses to the press have only damned him further. To Ford's critics, including other Committee members, racial rhetoric must be pushed subtly and anonymously. Most of the Committee including [TEX.GetLeader] still agree with Ford's theories, but disagree on the medium to propagate those ideas as to not destabilize the new America's international relations."
unionstate.32.a:0 "Side with Ford."
unionstate.32.b:0 "Side with The Committee."

unionstate.33.t:0 "Tying up Loose Ends"
unionstate.33.d:0 "Weaving spiders are the many members of the press that continue their fruitless search for Huey Long. Although the FBI has made the best public display of effort possible, there persist some underground press who do not believe syndicalists did the deed. While most pamphlets on this are published anonymously, the FBI have traced their origin, and surprisingly found them to be coming from both the left and right, politically speaking. These conspiracy theorists, as we call them, could destabilize our new government if they continue their publications."
unionstate.33.a:0 "Do whatever it takes to silence them!"
unionstate.33.b:0 "Leave them be - this will blow over."
TEX_covers_up:0 "§YThe government's ability to cover up the plot will improve§!"						 

unionstate.34.t:0 "Every Girl a Queen?"
unionstate.34.d:0 "The most delicate part of the Business Plot is upon us. It appears Huey Long's will dictates that, in an event of his injury or incapacitation, his wife Rose Long was to take his post. Many die-hard Long followers have come to Washington, demanding Rose occupy the Presidential Mansion until Huey Long be found. They are met with an equal number of former Federalists who insist Huey Long's running mate, William Lemke, is the constitutionally-correct President. Siding with the constitution as our best defence is perhaps the more prudent path, though it could also be seen as an insult to Huey Long's widow and enflame the anger of the public even further."
unionstate.34.a:0 "Make a public show of sympathy for Rose Long's cause."
unionstate.34.b:0 "The Constitution is not subject to sentiment."

unionstate.35.t:0 "But No One Wears A Crown"
unionstate.35.d.coverup:0 "Finally the Business Plot's master stroke is ready: exhausting and unresolved debates have worn down the willpower of Congress to elect a Vice President with absolute majority. A group of our more trustworthy Senators are ready to bring George Moseley into his own as Vice President, and to then serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office. Any attempts to uncover the truth behind Huey's disappearance have gone nowhere."
unionstate.35.d.uncovered:0 "Although he was maligned during the war for his almost nihilistic attitude, the journalist Westbrook Pegler has more than redeemed himself to the public today. Through investigative journalism, dodging government goons, and a dedication to facts over his own political reservations, the truth has been uncovered to the public. The underground press has exposed the true killers of Huey Long: his own bodygaurds. The blood money was traced right back to none other than interim president, George Moseley. The whole apparatus of state has moved to arrest Moseley, who implicated the War Powers Committee in what people are calling the 'Business Plot'. These men will be brought to justice, wherever they lay."
unionstate.35.d.scandal:0 "The Business Plot has succeeded, though it has come at great cost. Journalist Westbrook Pegler published an 'expose', accusing Moseley and others of conspiring to have Huey Long killed. Since its publication, Pegler's evidence has been proven flimsy and circumstantial - enough so that George Mosely was, in the end, considered more victim that perpetrator. The scandal has left a lingering taste among the public, but Moseley's allies in Congress were able to prevent any official hearings... and, after months of exhaustive and unresolved depates, have managed to arrange for him to serve as President until Huey is found. This involves a very specific alteration to Article II and the 12th Amendment, to allow for Moseley as President Pro Tempore to assume office."					
unionstate.35.a:0 "I love the Republic, I hate Democracy."
unionstate.35.b:0 "Walls Come Crumbling Down."

unionstate.36.t:0 "Twenty Second Amendment"
unionstate.36.d:0 "The Committee is in agreement on the future of the 17th Amendment, the amendment that forced direct election on senators. Passed under Wilson in his vain populist bid to promote insurgent democracy over our Republican system of government. The 22nd Amendment will ensure that this unneeded alteration to our system is repaired and Congress will again be represented in the way the Founding Fathers intended."
unionstate.36.a:0 "As our Founding Fathers intended."

unionstate.37.t:0 "Patriotism or Profits"
unionstate.37.d:0 "A conflict of interests has arisen between the market and the War Powers Committee. A recent speech given by Roger Babson highlighted the hypocrisy of multinational corporations that both claim to be patriotic while also opening factories in European syndicalist nations. Our own Fred Koch fired back by stating that the market and American people want their businesses to succeed as an extension of patriotism. While the War Powers Committee leads several multinational corporations, we have noticed a strong uptick in domestic sales that could remove the risk of retreating from foreign markets. It is time for the Committee to settle this national debate."
unionstate.37.a:0 "Business is our Business."
unionstate.37.b:0 "Patriotism is our Business."

unionstate.38.t:0 "The Second American Plan"
unionstate.38.d:0 "Although the syndicalists are defeated and their members gone to ground, there still remains the threat of the union growth Huey Long foolishly promised. A proposal from Congress may be able to remedy this. The original American Plan was legislation proposed during the Wilson administration to guarantee employers ability to challenge Union activities. The foolish Congress under McAdoo failed to properly ensure this right, but the new American Republic will correct that. The American Plan will allow individual states to pass right-to-work laws and authorizes the federal courts to prosecute union activity violating those laws."
unionstate.38.a:0 "Business Rights not Union Rights."

unionstate.39.t:0 "War Powers Committee vs Congress"
unionstate.39.d:0 "A meeting today between the War Powers Committee and several congressmen friendly to our cause was held to address the future of representation in the Presidential Cabinet. Fear that the political spotlight the War Powers Committee is under by holding cabinet positions has two possible solutions: the first is to coordinate with Congress in order to push through a law to reorganize the Presidential Cabinet to officially become the War Powers Committee. The second is to appoint several of our loyalist politicians from Congress to appease prying eyes and keep the stability our new American Republic needs. The latter comes at great political cost, and will weaken our position, though certainly it goes a long way towards obscuring our intentions."
unionstate.39.a:0 "The War Powers Committee will be the new cabinet."
unionstate.39.b:0 "Call in favors to appoint the congressmen."

unionstate.40.t:0 "NAACP Declares the government Illegitimate"
unionstate.40.d:0 "In the wake of the devastating civil war, the future of African American rights fought so long for is again threatened. Initial assurances of civil protection by Huey Long kept many from the streets as socialists and federalists roiled. There were even planned meetings in New York City for Huey Long to directly address civil rights concerns before that fateful day. Now with Huey Long gone, all illusions of safety are dead. Walter Francis White, along with several high ranking members of the NAACP, have declared the new America illegitimate. Many of them now prepare to emigrate to Canada and to other countries as Marcus Garvey did and so many others did during slavery."
unionstate.40.a:0 "So be it."

unionstate.41.t:0 "Mothers Movement Clashes With Feminists"
unionstate.41.d:0 "One of the least likely sources of support within the America First Party came from Mothers Movements. The Mothers Movements are a group of religiously-minded conservative women who aligned with the radical elements that sought to undermine Huey Long. Now that Huey is long gone, leaders like Alma Bridwell White and Elizabeth Dilling now direct hysteria against suspected socialists. Their marches have also demonstrated a xenophobia against Catholics and blacks. Their position within this new America is tenuous, as the highest members of our government regard the nineteenth amendment with only slightly more respect than the thirteenth through fifteenth."
unionstate.41.a:0 "For now they are useful."

unionstate.42.t:0 "President Moseley Dies, Charles Lindbergh is Inaugurated"
unionstate.42.d:0 "After a bout of illness and a delirium, President Moseley has died. In his final days in office, Moseley had refused every medical assistance, accusing every one he saw of being Jewish. The Vice President, Charles Lindbergh, was recalled to the capital to be sworn in. With the War Powers Committee in attendance, Charles Lindbergh was sworn in as the official 33rd President of the American Republic, as Moseley was only the interim President for his years in office. American expats have universally condemned the new President just as they did the old."
unionstate.42.a:0 "Does inauguration even matter any longer?"

### Pelley Events ###

unionstate.51.t:0 "Clare Hoffman causes Polio Outbreak"
unionstate.51.d:0 "It began in the Meeting Halls of the Silver Legion, the idea that vaccines were a syndicalist plot to poison America. This, coupled with the belief that America's public water has been poisoned by fluoride, has propelled many a new politician into office - none higher than that of former Congressman Clare Hoffman, who has gained a following within the Silver Legion. This has even led to the AFP ending Dr. Maurice Brodie's promising polio vaccine research. Now the summer heat has brought with it the largest Polio outbreak in American history. Although Clare is out of office now and the American Public Health Association has been rehabilitated, the damage is still done. Many Americans are now permanently crippled."
unionstate.51.a:0 "Polio must be stamped out."

unionstate.52.t:0 "Fate of Murphy Ranch"
unionstate.52.d:0 "Now that our Legion reaches from coast to coast, we must revisit our place of final resort Pelley had planned out. In the outskirts of L.A, this compound was built a ranch to sustain the Silver Legion in case of a syndicalist victory. Murphy Ranch, as it is called, now has the ability to become fully operational. Should we continue to fortify the homestead to protect our new Californian brothers? Or should we convert the land into a workplace for our reborn American industry?"
unionstate.52.a:0 "Fortify it."
unionstate.52.b:0 "Convert it."

unionstate.53.t:0 "Can You See The Real Pelley?"
unionstate.53.d:0 "Although only known to the highest-ranking members of The Silver Legion, there is a hidden depth in the mind of our Chief Pelley. To his closest friends, Pelley is more than a leader and a friend. He is their political, religious, and moral guide. Until now, a sort of secret doctrine has been hidden from the public at large due to their unwillingness to accept that religious and temporal authority are one and the same. Now that our enlightened leader is well-accepted in this brave new American society, should we go public with some of his more... esoteric ideas? Pelley's handlers, as it is, can barely keep him from exposing his deeper thoughts to the public at large. Is the mystery of Pelley enough for the history books?"
unionstate.53.a:0 "Too many would fear this."
unionstate.53.b:0 "The world is ready."

unionstate.54.t:0 "Divergent Thinking in Christian Identity"
unionstate.54.d:0 "Silver Legion representatives have done their best to screen for religious beliefs when recruiting, but our new recruits often propagate beliefs that do not fit the Pelley-Armstrong line. One group out in California called 'Mankind United' claims that America's savior is their local minister. Another has insinuated the government is willing to assist Catholic nations in their liberation. The potential threat to our power is limited, but at the same time disunity breeds contempt. The Silver Legion leadership is divided as to whether these ideas are dangerous enough to stamp out. What are we to do about these outrageous claims?"
unionstate.54.a:0 "Let the innocent lies rest."
unionstate.54.b:0 "Wickedness must be stamped out."

unionstate.55.t:0 "Rise of Speakeasies"
unionstate.55.d:0 "Despite the overwhelming wave of approval Prohibition received within the loyal Christian community, there were some with reservations. In the cities and up high in the mountains, illegal alcohol production has been reported by our agents. The demon drink is being produced by these moral traitors and is transported overnight to underground bars across the nation. We must stop this affront against our values, and catch the deviants responsible."
unionstate.55.a:0 "Alcoholism must be stamped out."

unionstate.56.t:0 "Second only to The Chief"
unionstate.56.d:0 "Our Chief Pelley was surprised when the Roman Catholic, Charles Coughlin, came into the Silver Legion offices to offer his services to The Commonwealth. His position has been tenuous since then, as our former Klansmen continue to monitor the publication of Social Justice. Today is different, however, now that his radio show's time slot has been taken by more important public services. His position as Chief Propagandist is effectively open. To whom should the post go to? To the very useful Herbert W Armstrong? To the loyal Richard Butler? or to an old America Firster Gerald K. Smith, whom has shown interest in turning Social Justice in to a real Christian publication."
unionstate.56.a:0 "Armstrong the enlightened."
unionstate.56.b:0 "Our loyal Butler."
unionstate.56.c:0 "Smith, the Second Firster."

unionstate.57.t:0 "The Great Lie"
unionstate.57.d:0 "The official record in America has always been biased in favour of the ruling party. Once in office, Thomas Jefferson slandered the memory of the great patriot, John Adams, and fooled subsequent generations into believing his love for Nativism was tyranny. Now we must erase the great lie perpetrated by presidential candidate and Governor of Ohio, Warren G. Harding, to hide his black ancestry. We have the papers to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that Harding's father was a black man and therefore complicit in a worldwide conspiracy against the Commonwealth."
unionstate.57.a:0 "Take that, Harding!"

unionstate.58.t:0 "The Sound and the Fury"
unionstate.58.d:0 "Today, famed author William Faulkner's seminal work 'The Sound and The Fury' released in theaters to critical acclaim. Most reviewers have praised the exaltation of the Compson family by the prodigal son, Jason. In the film, Jason sacrifices his hard-earned wealth to save his brother, Benjy, from a lifetime of pain, and saves his family's honour by sending his brother, Quentin, away to the barren North. Disaster strikes him when his niece, Miss Quentin, defrauds the family fortune and leaves town. Some critics have commented that the film is facetious and actually highlights the flaws in the Compson family and thus Southern society as a whole. Supporters of this interpretation cite author William Faulkner's liberal leanings, but those reviews were all published by known malcontents."
unionstate.58.a:0 "I wrote better films than this!"

unionstate.59.t:0 "Black Education Act"
unionstate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Pelley in order to solidify Christian Identity into the youth of America is nearly complete. His final act, which passed with unanimous approval by the shell of Congress, is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and, in particular, African-Americans. Notably it focuses the education of African-Americans for their role as laborers and distances them from older notions of religious unity across races. As part of his speech announcing the law, Pelley stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics, when it cannot use it in practice?'."
unionstate.59.a:0 "Education that suits them."

unionstate.60.t:0 "The Black Belt Act"
unionstate.60.d:0 "One of the more controversial acts that Pelley is proposing is to extend the 1899 Indian Appropriations Act into the African-American community. The proposed Black Belt Act would make communities in the South with majority African-American populations into a reserved space with independent public services. At least on paper, the Silver Legion claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous common-wealth to African-Americans nationwide. However, there comes even from our loyal members murmurs that whites within the Black Belt would also lose their citizenship and rights. What shall become of this act?"
unionstate.60.a:0 "Autonomy Now, Autonomy Forever."
unionstate.60.b:0 "Not Now, Maybe Later."

unionstate.61.t:0 "The Pass Laws"
unionstate.61.d:0 "The Silver Legion has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. The Silver Legion strongly discourages any comparisons to past laws and has defended their claims with violence. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Commonwealth."
unionstate.61.a:0 "Papers Please."

unionstate.62.t:0 "The Penal Act"
unionstate.62.d:0 "The Thirteenth Amendment made slavery illegal throughout the country. However, the Amendment allows for involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime. A new order passed by the shell Congress has increased the sentence time for moral crimes, and provided for more use of indentured labor in industry, thus being named the Penal Act. This Penal Labor has been given boost by reviving various Black Codes that criminalize attempting to vote as an African-American. The boisterous speeches Pelley delivers on the radio have tried to obfuscate the unfolding truth that slavery is back."
unionstate.62.a:0 "Do your time."

unionstate.63.t:0 "The Third Great Migration"
unionstate.63.d:0 "Those thousands of African-Americans that left America before the civil war are being joined by hundreds of thousands more fleeing Pelley's terror. Groups like the International Labor Defence and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate masses of people struggling to remain free. To the Silver Legion and their leaders, this plays into a long-standing fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally, the safer loyal Legionaries can sleep. The question is: what shall we do? Shall we let them leave, or shall we keep them here?"
unionstate.63.a:0 "America is expelling toxins."
unionstate.63.b:0 "Quick, Stop Them!"

unionstate.64.t:0 "American Refugees arrive"
unionstate.64.d.psa:0 "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled across the Rockies fleeing Pelley's goons. We have officially welcomed them as true Americans and more than a few are ready and willing to fight against Pelley."
unionstate.64.d.new_england:0 "A vast number of Americans, many of them African-Americans have fled into New England fleeing Pelley's goons. We have officially welcomed them as true Americans and more than a few are ready and willing to fight against Pelley."
unionstate.64.d.liberia:0 "The thousands that arrived with Marcus Garvey in the early 1930s anticipated that more refugees would come. Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
unionstate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Pelley is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America."
unionstate.64.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Pelley should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
unionstate.64.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
unionstate.64.d.hawaii:0 "An incredible amount of the Pacific separated us from the carnage in America, as well as the hand of that monster Pelley. We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Silver Legion that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers."
unionstate.64.a:0 "You are welcome to stay."
unionstate.64.b:0 "We do not want you."

unionstate.65.t:0 "Chief Pelley Dies, Gerald Smith Declared Chief"
unionstate.65.d:0 "Church bells around the country rang out today announcing the loss of Chief William Pelley to stress. Many of those bells were ringing in the ghettoes and reservations by the starving Americans hoping that Pelley's death would bring relief. These hopeful millions were scorned when the Vice Chief Gerald L.K. Smith announced at the funeral that he would serve as Chief in Pelley's stead until his Judgement Day. Despite this show of strength, American expats around the world cheer for the dictator's death and have pressed for condemnation of Chief Smith's continued Silver Legion regime in America."

unionstate.77.d:0 "An impromptu meeting has been held among the board members of the Share Our Wealth program. The organisation's shareholders consist of members of the AFP, the Prohibiton Party, and the Southern Tenant Farmers Union. These board members met at 2am, straddling the line between official business and secrecy. William Upshaw, of the Prohibtion Party, brought to the fore President Long's apparent betrayal of his party values. The AFP board members agreed that Long's rejection of a main campaign promise bodes ill for more 'morally-centred' legislation in the future. Francis Townsend, who joined Huey Long in order to push his Old-Age Revolving Pension Plan, agreed it was necessary to elect a new representative for the Share Our Wealth program, someone who wouldn't be beholden to the president's whims. After much debate, it was decided that newly-elected Louisiana Congressman, Gerald L.K. Smith, is far enough removed from Long yet still dedicated to social security. As the votes were tallied in Smith's favour, the board pondered what Smith's association with the Silver Legion might mean in the future..."

unionstate.78.t:0 "Dixiecrats Declare AFP Corrupt"
unionstate.78.d:0 "After the end of hostilities in Washington, a large section of the conservative Democratic Party pledged their alligence to [Root.GetNameDef] and to the ideals President Long follows. Implicitly, these Democrats hoped Long would fulfil their desires for more state power in exchange for allowing Long's economic reforms to easily pass. This unwritten promise was broken when Long denied them the ability to enforce Prohibition, going so far as to ignore their impassioned speeches in favour of repealing the Interstate Commerce Act. Many conservative Democrats now see the AFP's regime as merely a sham democracy that rejects any measure the Long political machine will not personally benefit from. The President was still shocked, however, when the halls of Congress were only 3/4 full this week.

The press has reported these dissenting opinions, and thus have also given us warning of the officers' coming protest in the capital in five day's time. We have no illusions these marchers will be peaceful, or that their march won't culminate in a demand for the Silver Legion to return power to the AFP. General Patton, still leading the Fifth Army, has promised he will protect our right to rule the Commonwealth. Giving him free reign against the marchers, however, will be a bloody battle that could easily backfire on us. Richard Butler has suggested instead having Legion supporters infiltrate the marcher ranks and disrupt them from within.

The tedious proccess of replacing state representatives with Legionaries has meant that we have become more and more reliant on the Dixiecrats remaining content in the meantime. After a recent push by Chief Pelley to pass Amendments 22-24, bringing in a new "Grandfather" clause -depriving people of rights not enjoyed by their grandfather- and requiring a profession of faith in order to serve in Congress, the agenda has turned to Pelley's final amendment: reserving private and government land for redistribution to Christians. This has spawned a surprise backlash. The Dixiecrats claim this eminent domain impedes the rights of states to their own land, something Huey Long promised he wouldn't do. Chief Pelley is now in a bind. If he gives into the Dixiecrats, it will make him look weak at the very time he needs to look like he has all the answers.

After a poorly-written passion play performed to entice membership was mocked in the city's newspapers, Legion members have begun to feel isolated from the community, and have begun travelling in armed groups. Tensions rose, and the breaking point came when the Baltimore police came upon a Legionaire lynching - and attacked the Legionaries. A full-blown riot in the streets has resulted, and the entire situation has been subsequently mishandled by the Maryland National Guard, who appear to not know which side to take. If we intervene to take the Legionaries out of the fighting, our favouritism will be obvious and it will cost us. If we leave them in the riots, however, it not only threatens to turn into a national scandal but might also call into question our loyalty to the Silver Legion. Still, some are suggesting this betrayal of our own could save face with the public by providing us the appearance of neutrality."

The entire incident was reported on as an attempted syndicalist coup against the Pelley administration, with the ensuing public sympathy providing plenty of leeway for government action to be taken against figures of suspect loyalty. This windfall of support has emboldend Pelley, who claims he predicted the outcome as biblical fact. Pelley recalled Herbert W. Armstrong to the capital, and has now announced a second book detailing his further predictions for America based on his reading of the bible. The Silver Legion, under Pelley's leadership, hopes to fufill the promises within this book in the coming years."

Public outrage spread rapidly, but thankfully enough work had already been done to ensure loyalty in and outside of the adminstration. For weeks, denials were issued, stern investigations made, and several scapegoats offered... until finally the worst of it was passed. The political backlash has still damaged the people's faith in the Commonwealth, but the Silver Legion has placed enough loyalists within positions of power that we are now secure.

After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Lawson Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."

Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

This has come as a shock to the Long administration; it's been well known that America is a largely Protestant with the Catholic population, whilst large as well, mostly reside in the greater area of New England, some of them only living as far south as southern Maryland, all well out of the reach of the American Union State at present. While Huey Long personally would attribute this gesture to traditional Catholic virtues of charity and diligence, as most would, some among the upper echelons of the AUS supporters, particularly the devout protestant Gerald L. K. Smith, despise the notion of Roman Catholic intervention, urging Huey Long to refute any attempt by the Vatican to potentially expand their influence in North America, citing the Cristero Wars in Mexico as an example of the Papacy's "corrosive attempt to uproot the values of the Free World.

Crossing into the city over the river from Fort Armistead, under heavy fire, on ramshackle barges for most part with the aid of loyalist elements in the city, the Papal Militia landed at Sparrow's Point and rushed headlong into the teeth of the enemy resistance along the riverside, splitting their forces and cunningly using the cover of back alleyways and side streets, advancing inward as the main forces battled the enemy across the main boulevards and through city parks. At the crescendo of the fighting in the city, the Papal volunteers, in a display of near-suicidal bravery, at once advanced on the enemy forces entrenched on Gulford Avenue outside City Hall, the Militiamen, with the aid of a number of local volunteers, many of them African-American and many more of them from the white Catholic citizenry, charged the barricades, overwhelming the enemy combatants, causing many of them to simply break rank and flee, and while many militiamen lost their lives in the fighting, including the heroic sacrifice of the militia leader, Father Emilio Arandes, by mid day, the city had surrendered to Huey Long and the American Union State. While this proved to be a huge victory for both Long and the militia, some within the military were angry with impudence displayed by the militia, with Field Marshal George Van Horn Moseley being particularly reluctant to acknowledge the role the volunteers played in taking the city, stating publically: "This war is our war, not their personal crusade""

Philip Acosta Carroll, an army officer and an irreverently patriotic and deeply religious supporter of the Papal Volunteers who was the chief architect of the Longist resistance in Baltimore, Carroll has the distinction of being a direct descendant of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, known to history as one of America's Founding Fathers and as the only Catholic signatory of the Declaration of Independence, a man hailed as a hero as the principle financial supporter of the American Revolution, many American historians credit the institution of Freedom of Religion in the  US constitution as a means of honoring the contribution of a Catholic man's diligence and charity to a largely Protestant country's war of independence. Now, hundreds of years after the American revolution, the United States stands at the forefront of another revolution, and it is here, as before, that Philip Carroll, like the Lord of Carrollton before him, has pledged himself to the American Union State and in accordance with recent communiques with the Vatican, Carroll has formally assumed leadership of the Papal Militia, ready to lead the Catholic faithful in America against the scourge of the Syndicalist and Stratocrat alike.

To that end, the corps commander, Philip Acosta Carroll, along with a high-profile cabal of devout Catholics, both famous and notorious, from the American political theater, have announced the formation of the Holy American League, a non-profit organization dedicated to Catholic, christian values of charity and diligence and the American spirit. Within this new coalition, Carroll and his militia have surrounded themselves with a posse of political elite, one of the more well known figures being New York Governor Al Smith, the Brooklyn-born democrat credited with a reputation as a venerable elder statesmen and for his involvement in the construction of the Empire State Building, it is hoped that Smith's moderate reputation would help legitimize the League in the eyes of the Senate and Congress. In addition to Smith, among the founders of the League, most controversially, includes woman's suffrage activist and  known socialist sympathizer Dorothy Day, who is herself most known for her relationship with the likes of Big Bill Haywood, Jack Reed and the SPA, all avowed enemies of Huey Long and the American Union State, and while Long has been comparatively lenient in allowing Day to continue to operate in the continental United States, mostly due to her socialist tendencies mostly revolving around humanitarian activism and charity, which happen fall in line with Long's welfare policies, the League has still garnered a great deal of public criticism for Day's history with the syndicates. Day's involvement might explain the strange absence of the loudest and most obvious supporter of American Catholics, and while Charles Coughlin himself was quite loud and ardent in his initial support of Carroll and the volunteers, the alignment with Day has turned Coughlin into the League's most scathing critic, verbally ripping apart the League on his radio show, stating loudly that he will oppose any measure that seeks to uproot the sanctity of American faith."

From Baltimore to Miami to Baton Rouge, the volunteers under Carroll and the League set about distributing food and water, providing medical aid and setting up hospital camps, religious services and education for children, helping to clear out rubble and repair the damage wrought by the fighting, and in the Deep South along the Black Belt, where the African American population were often subject to the most suffering and desolation from the war, many soon found themselves finding refuge with the Catholic volunteers, who piously and tirelessly labored to heal and rebuild the black communities damaged by the war, openly forsaking and condemning the racial violence suffered by the black minority in the Jim Crow South and fully embracing the unity of black and white Americans in solidarity and brotherhood. As one might imagine, this sentiment was not received well by the Dixiecrats of the American deep south political elite, who protested Huey Long's leniency with the League's sphere of influence spreading so far south, many of them beginning to align with Gerald L.K Smith's paranoid suspicion about the prevalence of the Catholic presence in the south, and even Charles Coughlin, despite his militant Anti-Klan stance, can't help but look at the League's increasing influence with African Americans without skepticism as to the validity of their intentions.

unionstate.306.d:0 "Ever since the founding of the Holy American League, the efforts on their behalf of providing aid to destitute Americans, the League's militiamen and humanitarian workers have seen a huge increase in volunteers across America, with many New Englanders and African Americans in the Deep South flocking to the ranks of the League, more importantly, the increase in popularity of the League also coincides with an increase in religious conversions to Roman Catholicism throughout the American Union State, with many of the League's new volunteers often pledging themselves in a deeply pious and ceremonious fashion, in accordance with Catholic doctrine, some of them taking oaths of Abstinence, Poverty or Chasity in asherence with their newfound faith. Inevitably, this was going to lead to a confrontation with the far right Protestant majority in America, and now, spurred on by Gerald L. K. Smith's fear-mongering, increasingly frequent incidents of violence between the League and the far right protestant and evangelical population have been reported in the Deep South, indeed, much of the christian right in America are furious at what they see as the encroachment against traditional American christian values , and espouse that the presence of the League, who the christian right decry as "Papists", are a conspiracy enacted by the Vatican to purge the continental United States of all who refuse to submit to the Vatican autocracy. And through it all, as is unfortunately the case with American christendom , the violent, terroristic activity of the Ku Klux Klan has begun to rear it's ugly head once again, the white supremacists are preaching that League's favoritism of the negro population is an obvious ploy to usurp the authority of the white man, and already, reports of vicious hate crimes and atrocities have begun to surface, some as far north of the Black Belt as Virginia. The situation appears to be rapidly spiraling out of control; many Huey Long's supporters among the Dixiecrats are complaining to the Kingfish personally about what they see as the League's arbitration, and even some members of the Minutemen were seen clashing with the League's militiamen. All of this presents a difficult dilemma to Huey Long, as much of his support is reliant on the conservative right in the South, and as such, the crisis must be handled with delicacy and tact. In other news, Charles Coughlin's weekly radio broadcasts have been postponed for undisclosed reasons."

K. Smith, and amidst a storm of accusations, posturing and the pointing of figures as to who did or didn't do what, a solution arose to the issue of the Holy American League that seemed a far more extreme measure than Long had anticipated, and yet, it might be one of the better options available to him. Smith purposes an Anti-Catholic Bill, the beginning of a means to counter the influence of the growing Catholic influence on the population, as well as artificially limiting their influence within the American government, to be stream-rolled through Congress; Smith remains adamant that the League's modus operandi is to seize control of the American Union State and turn it into a puppet state loyal to no authority but the Holy See. While the Kingfish was quick to dismiss Smith's ramblings, Patton's concerns about Carroll and the League are much more realistic to to hear; Patton does, indeed agrees that it is unlikely that a conspiracy by the Vatican is ongoing, however, he points out, very matter-of-factly, that Carroll himself, from an outside perspective, seems to be positioning himself as a potential leader for the Catholic minority as well as the voice of minority rights of those oppressed largely by evangelical protestants in the South, namely African Americans, and combined with the alliance between Carroll, Al Smith and Dorothy Day, Patton postulates that, while maintaining that any sort of armed Coup D'état is unlikely,  Philip Carroll is possibly positioning himself to run for President to unseat Huey Long in the next election. Furthermore, even though Patton claims that the unrest in the South can be easily brought into line with some well-placed peace keeping forces, perhaps combined with Long applying pressure to convince Charles Coughlin to support the League to help foster better relations between the League and christian far right, it might also be in Long's interest to, if Carroll's influence is, indeed, growing, to consider passing the anti-catholic bill to ensure a comfortable majority in the polls."

unionstate.308.d:0 "Evening fell upon Capital Hill, the towering, white dome stark against the pitch black sky, heavy rainfall swept across Washington D.C, with the crack of thunder heralding the dawn of a new era over the continental United States; a new era under the old order. Only a small contingent of military police sat outside the Capital building, a small but unnecessary measure to ensure the safety of the Kingfish's entourage on arrival. Huey Long was there, Fox Connor was there, so was Gerald L. K. Smith, their purpose that night was to briefly oversee the deliberation over the new Anti-Catholic Bill being considered, arriving well ahead of the senators and congressmen to the senate chambers, and despite the eerie emptiness of the building once inside, Long's inner circle was certain that the night would conclude decisively. Their assumptions would be proven right. The last anyone saw of the Kingfish and his cabinet was in Smith's office, where the three men sat, laughing, joking, and drinking (except Smith, obviously.), cavalier at their impending success as they listened to the new broadcast of Charles Coughlin's radio show, the first one in a long while. Father Coughlin, who spoke with his trademark tone of a parent speaking to his children, spoke of the impending Bill that sought to curtail his faith, and in so doing, usurp the faith that defined not only his identity, but that of a large, and growing, majority of the country, and despite this, he spoke in a manner that was almost frighteningly calm. As his show for the night came to a close, the last words that came over the radio were: "And my wrath shall wax hot; i shall kill you with the sword, and you will find that your wives shall be widows and your children, fatherless." The Capital Building of the United States, the spitting image of American democratic values, then erupted in an inferno as crate after of high-grade explosives detonated in the sewers below. Long, Connor and Smith, and a scant number of the Minutemen, would be incinerated in the blast, the former seat of the United States senate completely burnt to cinder as the military police looked on, awestruck. By tomorrow morning, coalition forces of both the Minutemen, under the command of Father Charles Coughlin, and the Holy American League, under the auspices of Philip Acosta Carroll, will have seized control of the White House just as similar elements consolidated power in Charleston, St. Louis and New Orleans, by that afternoon, radio communiques with Field Marshal Patton would affirm the peaceful transition of command of the armed forces to the administration of the coalition government of Carroll and Coughlin, and by evening, Philip Acosta Carroll would be sworn in as the new President of the American Union State."

unionstate.309.d:0 "With the collapse of the hegemony of Huey Long and his authoritarian clique of cripto-royalists, the question of what the Holy League's governmental reforms entail have begun to manifest, and it begs the question; did the question of an American Monarchy die with Huey Long, or does Carroll and the League have other plans? Many people, both at home and abroad, have drawn correlations between the Holy American League and the various other Nationalist Religious movements throughout the world; the Orthodox nationalists in Russia, the Vaterland Front in Austria, and of course, the Integralist movements in Portugal, Sicily and Brazil. All of these movements contain similar values, despite their vast cultural differences; ardent, patriotic nationalism, a strong empathies on adherence to religious values (Christianity.), an intense antipathy for both syndicalism and liberalism, and in all of them, a desire for societal and cultural restructuring around the old world virtues and, in said countries, to ensconce the balance of power under the auspices of a monarchy; the Romanovs, the Braganza, the Bourbons, and so fourth. The prospect of the American people accepting a return to Empire is, to put it mildly, a high hurdle to surpass at best; even ignoring the well-known history of the nucleolus of the American Revolution being born from Imperialist exploitation and oppression, between the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, it has been shown that many Americans simply cannot and will no longer abide the abolition of individual rights or democracy in favor a strongman in the White House, Newburgh Letter or not. It is doubtful that Philip Carroll, given his family lineage and his religious faith, would ever seek any kind of subservient accommodation with the royalists to our north, and certainly not after the debacle in mainland Britain. At the same time, however, Long, MacArthur and Carroll proved that one man's strongman can another man's savior."

unionstate.310.d:0 "In what many Americans were left dumbfounded today by a stunning joint declaration by President Philip Acosta Carroll, Father Charles Coughlin and the Holy American League announcing that the American Union State would, indeed, be transitioning to a form of constitutional monarchy. The astonishment of the majority of Americans, counter-intuitively, did not stem from the concept of an Imperial America, but rather, the declaration from Carroll and Coughlin that none other than Jesus of Nazareth, more colloquially and legendarily known as Jesus Christ, the eponymous prophet and central religious icon of Christianity, shall be coronated as King of the American Union State, the fulcrum point of all political and religious power in the continental United States. As it stands, this new political referendum, as the press has generously described it, is perhaps the single most controversial political decision in the history of the modern world. In a similarly confounding statement to coincide with the proclamation, Philip Carroll announced that he would, in fact, be resigning as the President of the United States, and instead assume the role of the seemingly more modest title of Regent, acting in accordance with teachings of the Bible, to oversee the administration of the new American Union State. Reactions to this declaration have been, to it mildly, perhaps as varied and mixed as they have ever been in the former United States; many Americans, even those among the Christian faithful, are flabbergasted at the notion of the apparatus of state being granted to an ethereal being in the judaic Son of God. Meanwhile, the markedly more outspokenly cynical critics of the Holy American League have openly denounced the move as a nakedly obvious and even delusional attempt to galvanize the religious population in America under the clerical dictatorship of Philip Carroll. How, in God's name, Carroll intends to legitimize this seemingly insane referendum remains to be seen."

unionstate.311.d:0 "As part of Philip Carroll's initiative to facilitate Americas transition into a Catholic state, the Holy America League has begun a series of restoration efforts among some of America's historical sites related to the legacy of christian piety on the American spirit. One such site of major import to Carroll's initiative is the site of Saint Mary's City, the original American colony of Catholic settlers along the Chesapeake Bay, it is the first settlement of what would form the county, and eventually the state, of Maryland, and is credited as being the origin point of American values of religious freedom, being the first settlement to establish the mandate of religious practice for both Catholics and Protestants. In the centuries since the unification of the colonies, and the American revolution that followed, Saint Mary's City now functions as little more than a tourist attraction, the descendants of the original settlers long since moved on to the more populous regions such as Washington or Baltimore. Now, with the beginning of Carroll's initiative to reinvigorate the old colony, new construction projects for the development of the city, as part of an economic plan based on an obscure, Syndicalist-designed development scheme originally intended for the state of Nevada, will be initiated in the former Maryland hamlet, to utterly transform it into a shining gem in the heart the forests along the Mid-Atlantic, even though the initial estimates place the project's completion as late as 1954. It is becoming clear to many, based on the sheer scale of the endeavor, that Carroll is determined to make America into an equally pious and prosperous nation, something to be admired in something more than mantra, and if the plans for Saint Mary's City are any indication, America is likely going to look very different in the near future."

With the continued threat of the Klan harrying the American people from the swamplands to the south, many African American converts have taken to forming citizen guards to protect rural WASP communities from opportunistic xenophobes and racial terrorists. The irony of the situation was not lost on the white southerners, as one might imagine; much of the suffering of black americans can be traced directly to the toxic influence of white supremacy in the Jim Crow South, infesting virtually every public service below the Black Belt, often at the direct beck and call of the Dixiecrats. The rise in popularity of these AD-HOC militias, known to these rural communities as "Knight Watchers", might mark the beginning of real change in America; Catholics and Protestant Whites have been more supportive of their dark skinned counterparts than ever before, and many communities in the south have taken to protesting racist institutions in the south, peacefully picketing police stations and Sheriff's offices in the name of godly solidarity with their fellow Americans. While the protestors are small in number, their message is loud and clear; that black lives matter and that all men are created equal."

The principle leadership of the League has exerted a great deal of effort in preparing for this; Al Smith has taken to meeting with the state governors in the mid-Atlantic to coordinate the efforts in helping to spread the gospel; Dorothy Day and her Catholic Worker's Movement has been campaigning in the factories in every major city along the east coast, championing the word of Christ in the workplace; Charles Coughlin, wild and irreverent as ever, has been touring the Carolinas and the Virginias to speak at rallies across the Deep South along the Atlantic, the clergyman whipping up a storm with nationalist southerners in support of the League's mission; and all the while, Philip Carroll has personally been involved with the process, taking cues from Father Coughlin and engaging with the people of America over the radio, in a series of so-called "Fireside Chats" with the common people, serving as the light to Coughlin's heat, the demure Marylander speaking candidly of the world's events and America's role in them. Indeed, it is a massive undertaking on the part of the League, but more importantly, it clearly the very beginning of the effort to legitimize his administration in the eyes of the general populace, the beginning of a series of conversion efforts, the east coast and then working their way westward, until the entirety of the continental United States, from sea to shining sea, stands united under the gospel of the Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit."

unionstate.314.d:0 "As the Holy American League continues it's project of breathing live into the American economy, a raucous debate has surfaced within the League as to the specific plan for revamping the American financial sector. The origin of the schism within the party stems from ex-socialist activist Dorothy Day, and venerable New York governor Al Smith, both whom, despite ether's ideology necessarily aligning with the comparatively extreme Integralists within the party, still continue to work with the for the betterment of America. Day, whose mere presence within the League has been a point of contention since it's foundation, argues that transitioning the American economy to the model of Distributism; a communal form of economic decentralization based on Judeo-Christian values of sharing and charity, where the country's production would be widely owned by the American populace instead of by private enterprise. Naturally, such a measure of collectivization has scared the pants off many of the more moderate members of the League, Al Smith chief among them, who champions that American Capitalism and a free market are of vital importance the American economy, even invoking Charles of Carrollton's role in the Revolutionary War as a principle argument in favor of the preservation of private enterprise for the sake of American prosperity. Not wanting to be mistook for showing favoritism to one side, Philip Carroll has delegated the decision of what economic model to adopt to the dictation of Father Charles Coughlin, whose enmity for the leftist Day and liberalist Smith is well known, and would likely favor whatever economic plan he felt would be most practical for Americas future."

What originally began with the Knight Watchers, those brave black men, devout in their adherence to god and fervent in the ideals of equality and solidarity with their countrymen, has rapidly blossomed into a multi-pronged phenomenon across the country as these small groupings of citizen militias, who have since grown in popularity across the continental United States, have begun adopting the pledges, titles, iconography and customs of full-fledged Knightly Orders in the fashion of the old European crusaders. In Maryland, the birthplace of the American Catholic, urban youths from Washington, Baltimore and the resurgent Saint Mary's City have organized themselves around the personal teachings and mantra of Philip Carroll and his family line as part of the eponymous Knights of Doughoregan Manor; in New York City, the austere and indomitable African Americans from the five boroughs have chosen to honor the bravery of the Harlem Hellfighters with the official formation of the Brooklyn Brotherhood; in New England, throngs of haughty, red-haired Irish Americans have flocked to the patriotically self-styled Antitemplars in defiance of the decedent king in Canada; in the Steel Belt, once the heartland of the Syndicalist Menace, has seen a plethora of men and women from Chicago, Detroit and Cincinnati, many of them medical workers, doctor and nurses, to join up with the new Red Hospitallers to guard against pro-Canadian propagandists across the Great Lakes; a similar phenomenon has sprouted up in the American southwest, along the border states with Mexico, militias have taken cues from their southern neighbors, with many women and Mexican Americans founding the Old Sonora Charter in honor of the Cristeros; along the Pacific Northwest, what started with a number of white volunteers in Oregon and Washington soon began to incorporate a growing number of Native-America converts, now lead by the Siletz nationalist, Hochmeister Elwood Towner, to defend the nation from internal and external threats, as the leader of the stalwart Order of the  Heartland. All of these groups of patriotic, pious soldiers, these modern day warriors of Jerusalem, have humbled Philip Carroll for their embracing of God's teachings, so much so that he has immediately enacted a decree to officially absorb these orders as an official part of the American military, where they serve abroad as a sterling example to all of the cultural unity and martial tenacity that God has brought them."

These are just the start of the League's educational reforms, and while it will, obviously, take time for the new teachings to take root, Philip Carroll and the League are confidently resolute that the next generation of American Catholic youth shall be the ones to see America flourish, both on the world stage and beyond."

Charles of Carrollton signed his name to the declaration that held the self-evident truth that all men were endowed by their creator, the impetus that loosed the arrow of American freedom at the heart of European hegemony, and it is here, in the righteous reincarnation of that very nation and by the proclamation of Charles of Carrollton's proud descendant and disciple, our Arch Regent Philip Acosta Carroll, that the separation Church and State is hereby abolished. All institutions of the continental United States, from the office of the Arch Regent on down to the roles of the Civil Services, shall incorporate Christian oaths of service and loyalty upon hiring; all hospitals, fire stations and police departments shall incorporate Catholic Priests into the workplace to moralize and sanctify the civil services with the blessing of Christ; the Roman Catholic Chaplin Corps, a long standing branch of the American military, shall be granted special status within the army, navy and air forces to function as part of the newly created office of "Christian commissars" to further bolster the moral of our frontline forces.

All across America, states dedicated old American idols of democracy and justice are being torn down; Lady Justice, the embodiment judicial corruption, has herself been judged guilty; the Statue of Freedom, the sole surviving relic of the now destroyed Capital Building, now smelted to molten metal just as Huey Long and his cabal were; and worst and most unforgivable of all; the Confederates, these grotesque monuments to a failed rebellion dedicated to the terrible cult of slavery; Lee, Stonewall, Forrest, all icons of the subjugation and torture of American citizens in the name of states rights, these cannot, will not stand, and the cheers of righteous as they tear this monuments to sophistry and cruelty down off their foundations are enough to make any American beam with the most holy of catharsis. But last of all, the  repugnantly pale-green monument to American deceit disgracing the skyline of New York City, a gift to the American continent from the French, or rather, a statute to sate the egos of the Americrat Oligarchs from their Jacobin cohorts, a revulsion against the new American spirit.

We ourselves have acknowledged this duality, for it was bred into the very fabric of our nation from the moment Charles of Carrollton signed his name to the document that unleashed the United States upon the world. But that was when America was weak, and America is strong now. The Protestants have finally seen the light of this, and by God, they have closed their hearts to the poison of European heresy and opened it to Christ Almighty, here in this new, American Israel, a sanctuary to eclipse all sanctuaries. And still, there are those who rebuke our lord. and it is a rebuke that shall not be ignored any longer. There are the Evangelists; sick, demented, old criminals who corrupt their fellow Christians in archaic, obscene doctrines of racial superiority and moral decadence; Baptists, Methodists, Episcopalians, Quakers, Puritans, all a blight, a taint, a corrosion of the perfect, incandescent American Spirit, and we demand compensation for this insult. By order of the Arch Regent, Lord Philip Acosta Carroll, like Cortes before him, shall conduct the first American Inquisition; from Anchorage to Miami, the country shall be made to kneel, the country shall be made to confess, and the country shall be made whole, pure in mind, body and spirit, free of all weakness, the best and greatest off all nations, and the equal of none of them.

TEX_GEORGE_MOSELEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 28, 1874, in Evanston, Illinois, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Van Horn Moseley graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1899 as a cavalry second lieutenant. He would serve in the Spanish American War commanding the 9th Cavalry Regiment where he even managed to achieve a major breakthrough against Ludovico Arejola, prompting a promotion to first lieutenant and a transfer to the 1st Cavalry Regiment. There he'd serve as Aide-de-Camp for Brigadier General J.M. Bell and J.M. Lee for the remainder of the campaign, fulfilling several staff roles in the rear. He'd be transferred back to the US in 1904, and would serve as a staff member of the Texas Headquarters, until being promoted to Captain in 1906. He'd continue to fill a variety of staff roles while at the same time attending the Army Staff College and the Army War College, of which he graduated in 1909 and 1911 respectively. He took part in Pershing's punitive expedition, providing logistical support to Pershing, and earning him the promotion to major. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organizing the Bureau of the Budget in 1921, after which he was promoted to Brigadier General for his remarkable performance. He'd become Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War and was put in charge of the Industrial Preparedness sector, which got him his promotion to Major General. In 1934 he had a major fall out with General MacArthur, and with the country's collapse into civil war, Moseley's first course of action was to leave the Federal Army and join the AUS Army in the south, where his experience and the lack of capable staff granted him an immediate promotion to Field Marshall by Huey Long.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong anti-immigrant and anti-semitic views both publicly and privately.\n- Along with Charles Lindbergh, Moseley has been seen in frequent meetings with important businessmen from outside the military sphere, and his loyalty to Huey Long is proving to be dubious at best."
TEX_GEORGE_PATTON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 11, 1885, in San Gabriel, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton vocally opposed his colleague constantly, and he decided to leave to the AUS after his former CO, Fox Conner, convinced him that the AUS was the true american government, and that the Federal Government was bound to fail if decisive action wasn't taken. With his reputation preceding him, Huey Long decided to skip the rank of general and name Patton an outright Field Marshall, a role which Patton claims to be more than prepared to fulfil.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While publicly his loyalty remains unquestioned, his former friendship with Dwight Eisenhower make many members of the staff distrustful of Patton\n- Has displayed strong racist views in public."

He graduated from the Officers' School at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana in 1917, and was transferred to the Aviation Division of the Army Signal Corps soon after. He earned his wings in 1919 and remained in service after the air branch was turned into the Air Corps. In 1931, he became Chief of Pursuit Section at Air Corps Tactical School, and would take charge of the 1st Pursuit Group of Alabama's Aerobatic Team, becoming a regional celebrity of his aerial feats. As 1937 loomed over, Chennault was considering resignation as the staff in Washington refused to promote him beyond Captain, considering him unfit for duty due to his declining health. When the American Civil War began, Chennault sided with the former Governor of Louisiana, giving Huey a small hike in recruitment as passionate observers of Chennault's performances filled the recruiting booths, and in exchange, Huey granted Chennault the honorary rank of Brigadier General for his service to the American Union State\n§YImportant Notes:§W- His health has been slowly deteriorating, with deafness and chronic bronchitis being the main issues Chennault will have to face sooner or later."

He'd stay as a teacher in West Point and marry Gladys Easterbrook in his time at the academy. In 1921, he began teaching Chemistry in West Point as well and in 1926, he graduated from the company officer course at the Infantry School in Fort Benning. A year later, he'd undergo and successfully complete an advanced course at the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill. After that, Collins taught weapons and tactics at the Infantry School from 1927 to 1932 where he requested a transfer to the Philippine Division from 1933 to 1934 and became a major. In 1935 and 1936, he graduated from Army Industrial College and the Army War College reaching the rank of lieutenant colonel. With the outbreak of the Civil War, Collins aligned with Patton within the army, and both chose to leave southwards to join Huey Long's forces. When Patton was nominated as Field Marshall by Huey Long himself, Patton requested the promotion of Collins to Brigadier General which was granted by the Southern Demagogue.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- An extremely talented yet aggressive commanding officer, his skills shine the most when leading an attack on the enemy rather than playing on the defence."

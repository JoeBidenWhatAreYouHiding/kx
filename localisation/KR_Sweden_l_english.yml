####Ideas####
SWE_political_chaos_idea:0 "Political Stagnation"
SWE_political_chaos_idea_desc:0 "Since her neutrality after the First Weltkrieg, Sweden's political scene remained relatively stable, remaining as a constitutional monarchy in the North. Alas with the resignation of the previous Prime Minister and the mounting economic stagnation, little is done within the Riksdag. Either side that puts forward a bill is swiftly rejected by the opposing side, alongside increasing tensions globally, the upcoming election is seen as a new hope for the future of Sweden."
SWE_political_chaos_idea2:0 "Political Stagnation"
SWE_political_chaos_idea2_desc:0 "Since her neutrality after the First Weltkrieg, Sweden's political scene remained relatively stable, remaining as a constitutional monarchy in the North.

SWE_german_reach_1:0 "German Economic Influence"
SWE_german_reach_1_desc:0 "While she remained neutral in the First Weltkrieg, Sweden has enjoyed an array of trade deals with the German Empire, seen as the economic bastion of central Europe. While this has strongly aided the Swedish economy it has not gone without its drawbacks, German industrialists and business now hold deep influence within the nation, able to influence the political scene to support both them and German interests."
SWE_conservative_army_idea_1:0 "Conservative Army Leadership"
SWE_conservative_army_idea_1_desc:0 "Due to her neutrality, Sweden’s military has slowly become filled with a stagnate and old view on warfare. With many generals lacking active experience in warfare and combat, the military doctrine of the armed forces has become aloof and disjointed. Alongside this, many within the upper echelons of the army openly espouse a conservative political stance, a stance that may become an issue if an election was to end unfavourably for them."
SWE_statare_idea:0 "Statare Workforce"
SWE_statare_idea_desc:0 "Statare are a form of contract workers from before the Swedish Industrial revolution, a form of labor force employed by the state. They generally live in poor households, sometimes described as barracks, in which they are then paid with food and these living accommodations. Seen as the lowest rung of society in Sweden, their mention abrupts much controversy in the political scene, with the issue of keeping the system or abolishing it thrown around the Riksdag."

####Focuses####

SWE_rikstag_restructuring:0 "The Riksdag's Rising Stagnation"
SWE_rikstag_restructuring_desc:0 "It is no secret to the general public in Sweden that the current government has, so far, proved inefficient. After the resignation of Arvid Lindman, the Electoral League conservative party has suffered from public support, relying on Lindman’s charisma to rally the conservatives together. Now with this stagnation, and the upcoming election in September, the conservatives must make quick and decisive actions to achieve public support, or risk losing to Hansson’s social democratic party."
SWE_farmer_reachout:0 "Indulging Folkpartiet's Needs"
SWE_farmer_reachout_desc:0 "Our coalition with the Folkpartiet has, for the most part, remained steady. Their numbers may be less than ours in the Riksdag, but remain vital in seating us in any sway in parliament. We must assure them that their needs will be met, making promises for the election to come."
SWE_budget_debates:0 "Discord Over Budget"
SWE_budget_debates_desc:0 "Today all members of the Riksdag will attend a meeting and debate over the current national budget. With the economy considered generally well at this moment in time, unless something catastrophic were to occur, heated disputes between parties will be likely."

SWE_german_business_linger:0 "German Business Influence"
SWE_german_business_linger_desc:0 "The leviathan that is the German economy has done wonders for Sweden, aiding in massive industrialisation projects throughout Sweden, however this has not gone without consequence. Many industries in Sweden answer to Berlin, considering Germany's opinion over Sweden’s own government. Alongside this, many in Sweden are afraid of being drawn close to Germany, believing that such a move would guarantee Sweden’s involvement in any future wars Germany is likely to find herself in. Soon the government will be faced with a tough choice regarding this behemoth."
SWE_dark_monday_cloud:0 "Black Monday Strikes"
SWE_dark_monday_cloud_desc:0 "After the crash of the German economy, the ripples of her problems have finally hit Sweden, completely crippling our economy, something must be done to remedy this, for if the Electoral league fails to address it, their failure in the upcoming election will be certain."
SWE_cutting_corners:0 "Tightening Expenses"
SWE_cutting_corners_desc:0 "One of the bills presented by the Electoral league is to reduce government expenditure on what it deems ‘unnecessary spending’. Alongside this, the government will reduce exports of goods, hoping to self-regulate her economy by the policy of protectionism."
SWE_minor_welfare_imp:0 "Limited Welfare Formulation"
SWE_minor_welfare_imp_desc:0 "In hopes of reaching out to the poor worker and citizenry, a policy of limited government welfare has been enacted, doing so will improve the quality of life for those unemployed and affected by Black monday. While helping those worse off, the Electoral league hopes this may also draw in voters from Hansson’s party."
SWE_companies_crisis:0 "Minor Business Subsidies"
SWE_companies_crisis_desc:0 "By supporting some of our primary industries, those in fishing and manufacturing, we can hope to create more jobs. This should in turn reduce unemployment and increase support for the Electoral league."
SWE_cutting_armed_forces:0 "Limiting Military Expendature"
SWE_cutting_armed_forces_desc:0 "A new bill has passed in the Riksdag, supported by the social democrats and Farmer’s league, cutting government expenditure on non-essential military items has been enacted. Reducing costs to the army has upset many amongst the general staff, however with unemployment up to 25%, we can spare no quarter."
SWE_more_austerity_measures:0 "Raising Taxes, Lowering Costs"
SWE_more_austerity_measures_desc:0 "The AV has proposed and passed a bill in which many forms of taxes across Sweden will be increased, while annoying the population in the short term, it is believed it will reduce costs and after a short time allow for the lowering of taxes once more."
SWE_final_hurdle:0 "The Final Hurdle?"
SWE_final_hurdle_desc:0 "After Lindman’s resignation, the scourge of Black Monday and the government's management of it, Sweden’s future still remains undecided. In the coming weeks the 1936 election will be held, will the AV’s response to Black Monday have been enough to win over the population? Or shall Hanssons charismatic Social democrats win a majority? Or perhaps, shall the SSV rise to an electoral victory?"

SWE_black_monday_woes:0 "Woes from Black Monday"
SWE_black_monday_woes_desc:0 "While the former conservative government was rather successful in their initial handling of black monday, its economic depression is still rather prevalent in the nation. As such, doubling down our efforts at reducing its effects on the economy and general populace is a must."
SWE_keep_private_property:0 "Private Property Upheld"

SWE_people_party_front:0 "Folkpartiet Leads the Coalition"
SWE_people_party_front_desc:0 "While it was somewhat surprising to see an electoral victory from the GEL, even more surprising is the People’s Party leading the coalition with the GEL. Now, with a vision of true libertarianism being able to be achieved within Sweden, alongside some of the GEL’s protectionist and corporatism policies."
SWE_classical_liberalism:0 "Introduction of Classical Liberalism"
SWE_classical_liberalism_desc:0 "The basis of the People’s Front party is that of economic and political conservative liberalism, based around reduced government intervention and a focus on the free market. We shall begin to allow the free market to flourish in Sweden, and as it does so shall the nation's economy prosper."
SWE_independent_industry:0 "Investing in Sweden"

SWE_sailing_the_market:0 "Sailing Upon the Market"

SWE_small_business_centred:0 "Small Business Priority"
SWE_small_business_centred_desc:0 "To truly allow the market to blossom, there must be businesses booming in it, to this effect we shall further support and funding for those starting up their own personal businesses. By doing so, we shall not only increase employment opportunities but also increase the amount of home grown Swedish industry."
SWE_privatise_railroads:0 "Mass Privatization of Railways"
SWE_privatise_railroads_desc:0 "By privatising the national railways, we can allow the companies to increase their efficiency without government interruption."
SWE_building_bridges_and_roads:0 "First National Highway"
SWE_building_bridges_and_roads_desc:0 "We shall begin the starting work on a national highway, imitating the design done in the German Empire."
SWE_trams_and_people:0 "Expanding City Transportation"
SWE_trams_and_people_desc:0 "Expansion of Trams and other public transportation methods in our larger cities will allow for better transport for the average citizen."


SWE_reaching_out_to_soc_lib:0 "Crops with the Bondeförbundet?"
SWE_reaching_out_to_soc_lib_desc:0 "While our coalition with the AV has allowed us to win the election, their heavy handed approach to market protectionism and corporatism has hindered our advances on liberalisation of the economy. To the centre-left sits the Farmer’s League, a party devoted to uplifting the farmer’s amongst Sweden, alongside approaching the economy in a social liberal stance. Many of their economic views align nicely with our own, the only points of contention being that on national values. We now have a chance to gain their support, or to remain with our conservative allies."
SWE_rule_of_law:0 "Enforce The Rule of Law"
SWE_rule_of_law_desc:0 "With the rable rousers in the radical left and the malignant militancy in the far right, it has been shown that these groups have a direct disregard for the rule of law. We shall bring down the full might of the legal system against these dissidents."
SWE_ban_syndicalism:0 "Silence Syndicalist Papers"
SWE_ban_syndicalism_desc:0 "Syndicalist papers and publishers are nothing more than pawns of Paris and London, brainwashing our population into the false distopian ideas of syndicalism."
SWE_political_paradise:0 "Free Political Utopia"
SWE_political_paradise_desc:0 "Sweden shall be a bastion of free, but moderate, political thought."

SWE_kingly_liberalism:0 "Kingly Liberalism"
SWE_kingly_liberalism_desc:0 "As the world modernizes so should some of our traditions, by extending out a hand to our King to observe and have a look into the workings of our government, we can hope to bring our monarchy into the future."
SWE_bastion_of_liberalism:0 "Sweden, Liberal and Proud"
SWE_bastion_of_liberalism_desc:0 "The People’s Party has achieved something truly amazing, Sweden now stands atop the global market. With a happy and proud population, Sweden’s future is now secure in her style of classical liberalism!"
SWE_fruits_of_capitalism:0 "Fruits of Capitalism"
SWE_fruits_of_capitalism_desc:0 "It is shown, time after time, that capitalism is the only successful economic model to exist, by following along its policies, we have benefited greatly.

While the majority of our support base comes from the traditional right who wish to see the crown restored, some in the military desire to maintain their control, seeing it as more efficient.

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_Gustaf_V_DESC:0 "Gustaf V Bernadotte was born in 1858 and was the crown-prince of Sweden and Norway from 1872. It is no wonder that he is a man of the old ways, as during his father's reign the King of Sweden acted both as head of state and head of government, with ministers held responsible only to him. However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around."
politics_nils_flyg_desc:0 "The figurehead of Swedish totalism, Nils 'Nisse' Flyg, is considered by many to be a colourful character. Born in the Stockholm working-class neighbourhood of Södermalm, Flyg has been active in the Swedish radical left since a young age. In 1917, he split off from the SAP with Zeth Höglund and Karl Kilbom to form the Swedish Communist Party, a brief experiment that soon failed when the Russian revolution was crushed. Nonetheless, the young Flyg would prove to be a force to be reckoned within the Swedish left.\n\nIn more recent years, Flyg distanced himself from his less radical comrades and took on the doctrine of total commitment to the Revolution propagated by the Sorelians in the Commune of France and Oswald Mosley in the Union of Britain, though adding his own unique values to it as well: Flyg is known to oppose notions of an indigenous socialist revolution in America and, ironic to his previous positions, Russia, believing that the revolution has to originate in Europe as it would otherwise take the shape of anti-European imperialism, noting on the side that neither Russia nor America harbours an orthodox totalist movement."

swefop.998.d:0 "Recently we have come into control of the areas of Labrador and Newfoundland, holding a unique piece of old history. Harking back to the vikings, like those of Leif Eriksson, the area was apparently discovered and named Vinland, or Winland. The name comes from the believed grapes that grew in the area, as the Vin stands for ‘wine’, however this can be disputed as also meaning ‘pasture’ or ‘meadow’. As of yet, no tangible evidence of Viking settlements have been found, but many documents from the kings of Denmark aid in the belief of a viking settlement long before Columbas ever arrived at the New world. Excavations and archeologists from our prestigious schools have already begun arriving, hoping to find and uncover any physical proof of Nordic settlements, it now only remains a matter of time until we do. \n\nWhile such history remains interesting, using this belief of the first North American colony from Europe has allowed us to establish a colonial government there, mimicking our current government. Whether such a state will be successful remains to be seen, but this is another step in uncovering our history."

swefop.777.d:0 "Not seen since 1809 when Finland was ceded to Russia after the Swedish Empire’s defeat at her hands, Finland now rests once more upon Sweden’s watchful eye. The current Swedish government has shown in a display of power, the rising of the Swedish flag over the town hall in Hamina, once called Fredrikshamn when under the Swedish Empire, where the former Treaty of Fredrikshamn was signed, ceded Finland to Russia. \n\nWith such a display, many Finns have started coming out in resistance to the Swedish occupation, many putting aside their ideological differences in defence of Finnish independence. Such resistance has been met harshly with Swedish soldiers and officers as the Stockholm government decides on what to do with their newfoundland. \n\nThe first and most straightforward option is total annexation and reintegration of Finland into Sweden. This would force a long and arduous process of annihilating Finnish culture and sovereignty, while likely suffering strong resistance from the native Finns. Some in government say this is the only option as, like Jörmungandr, in an immortal cycle of allowing the Finns self-governance will only lead to constant rebellion. \n\nAnother camp favors the idea of integrating the Finns but offers another solution. Annex the main areas that house a large Swedish presence, and install a puppet administration over the rest to subdue the Finnish resistance while also slowly forcing their reintegration back into Sweden. \n\nA final group sees the total integration of Finland as a truly impossible feat, due to Finland’s many years of self-governance, forcing a reintegration would doom Sweden with economic issues and constant uprisings. As such they advocate for putting a pro-Swedish government in charge of Finland, giving the Finns a sense of self-governance while still keeping them aligned with Sweden. \n\nA choice must be made soon, as the Finnish resistance only grows with each passing day."

Now, we’ve lost all our imperial territories, from the mountains in Norway, flatlands of Denmark and all the way to the glistening shores of the Gold Coast in Africa, since Russia’s involvement we have fallen far. /n/nHowever, with the shift of political affairs in our nation, the government has decided to pursue and rebuild the empire we once had.

With that act, nearly a century of shared rule, diplomacy, and intertwined destiny came to an end. What followed was a peaceful separation, but one that left many Swedes feeling betrayed and many Norwegians yearning for full sovereignty.\n\nNow, with Norway brought once more under Swedish control, even if by force, we stand at a crossroads. Shall we revive the spirit of the old dual monarchy, offering a more conciliatory union that might win over hearts and minds in Oslo? Or do we declare that the time for compromise has passed, and that Norway shall be ruled directly from Stockholm, a province of the greater Swedish realm?\n\nThe past offers guidance, but it is we who must decide the future."

Whether led by czars, commissars, or autocrats cloaked in modern titles, Russia has always cast a long and heavy shadow over the North. Its ambitions are vast, its borders never settled, and its appetite for influence unending.\n\nNow, as tensions rise across Europe and the balance of power begins to shift, Sweden must confront the truth: peace with Russia is temporary, but preparedness is eternal. Our generals speak of ancient wars, of Narva and Poltava, of lost provinces and faded glory. The people whisper of revanche, of defense, of destiny.\n\nWhether we strike first or steel ourselves for the inevitable, one thing is certain, the Russian Bear watches, and it may soon move."

The flags of Denmark and Norway now bow to Stockholm's rule, with Copenhagen's harbors and Oslo's fjords firmly under our control. Yet, this triumph is marred by widespread unrest, as protests flare across the newly annexed territories, from Aarhus to Bergen. Whispers of defiance echo in the streets, and the world watches with unease as Sweden's ambitions cast a long shadow over Europe. Shall we consolidate our grip on Scandinavia through unity, crush the dissent with an iron hand, promote a shared Nordic identity, or boldly proclaim our destiny to reshape the continent?"

swefop.6.d:0 "The dream of empire, once buried beneath centuries of neutrality and modest diplomacy, has been reignited and realized. Under firm and visionary leadership, Sweden has cast off its traditional restraint and seized its destiny as the dominant power in the North. The Nordic lands, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Iceland, have all been brought under Swedish control, willingly or otherwise. Even the ancient foe to the east, Russia, has bowed before the might of a resurgent Swedish war machine.\n\nFrom the icy fjords of Norway to the windswept steppes beyond the Karelian Isthmus, Swedish soldiers now march under the banner of the Three Crowns. The Baltic Sea, once contested, is now a Swedish lake. Stockholm has become the capital of a new empire, an empire that recalls the days of Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII, but now reborn for the modern age.\n\nSome hail this resurgence as the beginning of a golden age for Scandinavia. Others whisper of tyranny and retribution. But one thing is certain: the Swedish Empire is no longer a memory—it is a force the world must reckon with."

sweden.1.t:0 "The Ever Present Germans"
sweden.1.d:0 "After the hard-fought victory of the German Empire in the Weltkrieg, the German nation sought to expand her influence and power. With vast swathes of Afrika, East-Asia and Europe now under either colonial regimes or allied crowns, the Germans created in themselves a new source of dominance. During this, German businesses sought to expand within Sweden, with our vast iron and zinc mining operations in the north, to factories and stores in the urban south, almost half of all Swedish companies can either trace their benefactors or direct ownership to the German Empire. This initially seemed to only benefit Sweden, providing much needed jobs to the unemployed, increased industrialization as well as further German immigration.\n\nHowever, it has not come without a cost, many of these businessmen hold sways on politicians in the Riksdag which many in Sweden see as a slow German takeover. The Swedish Social Democratic Workers party has continued their agenda of the removal of key German businesses to maintain Sweden’s sovereignty and neutrality on the global scale, tantalizing the fear of Sweden becoming yet another puppet colony in Germany's collection. While many in the General Electoral League believe only minor reform is needed to control the German influence in Sweden's favour, however some in the People’s Party are leaning towards the Social Democrat cause which has put strain on the centre-right coalition. As such, the Riksdag remains once again torn on the subject, with no succinct outcome decided on."

sweden.2.t:0 "The Political Situation"
sweden.2.d:0 "With her neutrality in the Weltkrieg Sweden has been allowed to maintain a stable political scene compared to the rest of Europe. While the fallen Kingdom of Britain and Republic of France both fell to the hordes of Syndicalists, Russia is currently under the leadership of the so-called Social Liberal Kerensky since the ravages of the Russian Civil War. However this apparent stability has not stopped some wayward Swedes from aligning with those considered flung too far outside the political scene. \n\nOn the centre-left are the Farmers’ League, seen as an agrarian and socially liberal party, they enjoy much of their support from the rural farmer base, most commonly found in coalition with the larger leftist parties, it's possible they may be swayed right if the conditions are good. The largest Leftist party, lead by Per Albin Hansson, presiding over the Swedish Social Democratic Workers’ Party which maintains a centre-left to moderate-left political stance, also remaining to adhere to the Monarchy Sweden currently holds. Further left are the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party, a contingent of more Radical social democrats that adhere to many of Per Albin Hansson’s policies bar the question of the Monarchy, seeing it as a symbol of reactionary tradition, believing Sweden can only truly be free when she is a republic. \n\nInspired by those in France and Britain, a syndicalist group calling themselves the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden, hope to abolish the monarchy and bring about a syndicalist revolution in Sweden like other syndicalist nations. They share membership with the Left party but are barred from coalition status as they are seen as far too radical. Finally are the splinter parties of the National Syndicalist Party of Sweden and the Communist Party of Sweden, headed by Nils Flyg and Sven Linderot respectively. Sharing many of the similar policies, due to their small status they are in coalition with each other in the hope of achieving more seats in the Riksdag, while a victory for them is impossible, they may be invited by other factions. \n\nOn the Right is the Peoples’ Party, a classical liberal group seen as a moderate bridge between both the centre right and left, it currently enjoys coalition status with the conservatives. The largest Conservative party is the General Electoral League, currently led by Gösta Bagge, it believes in the ideas of a protectionist economy while maintaining conservative values, adhering close to the Crown of Sweden. Further right resides small scatterings of military cliques and ultra-nationalist paramilitaries, the largest military clique residing around Helge Jung, with his group nicknamed the ‘Jung Junta’. Within the Ultra-nationalist groups preside Archibald Douglas, a leading military figure, Birger Furugård whose policies echo that of the legionnaires throughout Europe, and Elmo Lindholm following a Maurassian system of governance.."

swedem.0.t:0 "The General Electoral League Secures Victory"
swedem.0.d:0 "Standing as the ballwork of conservatism in Sweden, the General Electoral League under Gösta Bagge has achieved a victory in the election. Seen as a somewhat unexpected victory due to Per Albin Hanssons rising popularity, it seems Bagge's response to the Black Monday crisis garnered enough trust to allow his party to achieve victory. Alongside this, support from their libertarian allies in the People’s Party under Gustaf Andersson has allowed Bagge to secure a majority of seats in the Riksdag, allowing them to hopefully pass bills and laws without too much objection from the Left. \n\nMoving forward, there is still much to do. While successful in their initial response to Black Monday, its economic effects are still hurting Sweden and fixing it has become the government's main goal moving forward."
swedem.0.a:0 "Stability under Tradition"

swedem.1.t:0 "The General Electoral League sets out her objectives"
swedem.1.d:0 "The General Electoral league stands out as the mainline conservative party in Swedish politics, headed by the former Lindman, it defines itself by its approach of mild corporatist economics with the view of protectionism while maintaining social cohesion and tradition. The party favours many voters from those who align with the current monarchy, labeling itself as the only true party to uphold the Crown’s position in its entirety. Gösta Bagge and his party now set out about fixing the issues they see plaguing Sweden, positioning Sweden onto the global stage either as a neutral factor focused on her own defence, becoming a part of one of the major factions playing their hand at international cooperation or secluding herself to her northern neighbours in a bid for Nordic unity. With this the party has formed an official coalition once more with the People’s Party, a staunchly classical liberal party that finds itself largely compatible with the Electoral league, such a relationship gives Bagge the needed seats to dominate the Riksdag, and place his party in a good position against the opposition."

swedem.2.t:0 "Electoral Victory Approved by the Army"
swedem.2.d:0 "It is not unknown to many in Sweden that the generals and marshals in the Swedish Armed Forces retain right leaning sentiments. Distinct cliques such as those aligning with the general Archibald Douglas who hold near ultranationalist sentiments, or those like Helge Junga who preside over a more traditionalist view exist, strengthening the conservative support base. \n\nWith these groups in mind, the government has made distinct outreaches of support via funding of the military apparatus in an obvious attempt to court the Army further into the current government. While aligning with the ultranationalists would cause mass political outcry from opposition and socialists alike, the more moderates in the Army will provide much needed stability through these turbulent times."

swedem.3.t:0 "The Nordic Bulwark"
swedem.3.d:0 "At last, the tireless efforts of the Electoral League have borne fruit, with the economic devastation of Black Monday now a distant memory. Strengthened by unwavering support from the Armed Forces and the continued success of a robust protectionist market, the League can finally bask in its well-earned triumph. What once seemed like an insurmountable challenge—competing against Hansson’s Social Democrats in the polls—has been decisively overcome. A crucial turning point came with the strategic alliance between Bagge’s Electoral League and Gustav Andersson’s market-liberal-aligned People’s Party. This partnership secured vital seats in the Riksdag, surpassing the threshold for a general majority and effectively granting the coalition the power to pass legislation with ease. With this newfound authority, sweeping economic and political reforms have been set in motion. Among the most significant changes is the introduction of a corporatist economic model, designed to further expand Sweden’s industrial base. By fostering closer collaboration between the government, businesses, and labor organizations, this system allows for smarter allocation of resources, more efficient urban planning, and the development of new industrial sectors. As a result, economic growth has accelerated, and the general quality of life for all Swedes has begun to improve. \n\nAgainst all odds, Bagge and his party have not only solidified their dominance in Swedish politics but also laid the foundation for a new era of prosperity and stability."

Currently led by isolationist proponent Gustaf Andersson, it aligns itself closely with the Electoral League and remains in a close coalition with her. However some of Andersson’s comments have taken a harsh stance against the 3rd Internationale governments and as such has caused strained relations in London and Paris. Using its coalition connection, the party allowed itself to come ahead in the election as its seats became vital for a majority in the Riksdag for Bagge’s conservatives. \n\nWith this victory, Andersson and his once minor party now have the chance to bring about true liberalism to Sweden, equality amongst the population and stability on the world stage."

swedem.6.d:0 "While much of our support base comes from those working in the buildings in our cities, and our conservative allies attracting their own entourage of support, a largely neglected part of society in Sweden is that of the smaller farmers. While many of the larger farms in Sweden owned by wealthy individuals generally vote conservative, many smaller tend to vote towards either Hanssons social democratic party or the smaller Farmer’s League. The Farmer’s league sits comfortably near us politically, made to represent the more agrarian voter base, they hold economically liberal views while aligning progressively in terms of social policies. While we find them now and then at odds with us regarding social points, we find much common ground on the position of the economy. We may offer them a position in our coalition, conceding some of our power in turn to widen and broaden our support base, alongside expanding our seats in the Rikstdg. Such a move would come with compromise, we will allow them to focus and improve areas based around farmers in Sweden, however our allies in the General Electoral League are unlikely to view such a move favourably and in turn some guarantees with them as well to maintain the coalition must be made. Or, we could simply ignore this smaller party, we already have the backing of the conservatives, so what would we need with a party of small farmers and agrarian? The choice is ours."

The coalition has confided in each other today to hold an internal vote on the place of corporatism in the coalition. One the right stands the hardline conservatives, favouring full formation of Swedish guilds across the nation alongside the forceful conversion of unions to government control. Due to their radical nature, the hardliners are unlikely to impose their view directly, however they have shown support for the moderates in an attempt to achieve some level of success. The moderates advocate for increased expenditure in Swedish guilds, indirectly forcing out non-Swedish guilds in favour of native ones. They allow for the establishment of trade unions under some rules of disallowing radicalism. \n\nOn the most skeptical side sit where the majority of the People’s Party sits, viewing the majority of corporatism as a net negative for the economy and as a betrayal of the free market model. They offer minor concessions to pro-Swedish guilds but mostly refuse any major government interjection on the free market.

swedem.10.d:0 "In what many saw to be a likely landslide win, Hansson and his men have achieved an electoral victory, with a majority of seats taken by the Sveriges socialdemokratiska arbetareparti members. The party advocates for an increase in state welfare, equal shared rights and a relatively neutral foreign policy. Their golden egg is the Folkhemmet, brainstormed by Hansson himself, it invisions a ‘People’s Home’. An economic system using capitalism to its benefit to aid and help the people of Sweden. With heavy investments in the health sector as well as infrastructure improvement, the Folkhemmet aims to completely reforge Sweden into a social democratic bastion, the likes of which as not yet been observed elsewhere.With the nation still reeling from the economic turmoils of Black Monday, and the overshadowing view of the populace demanding results, Hansson has his work cut out for him."

swedem.11.t:0 "Folkhemmet"
swedem.11.d:0 "The Folkhemmet, known as The People’s Home, is the main running point for Hansson. It's the vision of a better Swedish society, one where the nation is a home for all its citizens, where all are cared for equally. Regardless of class or background, it espouses the notion of collective concern for all in Sweden, emphasizing solidarity. Redirecting the usual ideals of the abolishment of capitalism like many other more socialist governments, Hansson’s Folkhemmet seeks to humanise and improve capitalism through state intervention and cooperation between unions, businesses and the central government.\n\nThe most important aspect of this is the welfare plan, a national state welfare open to all citizens. Allowing for ease of access to healthcare, education and job opportunities. Seemingly seen as idealistic by Hansson’s opponents, him and his party are hopeful that such a plan can and will be made a reality."

Now, however, given our assumption to national leadership and electoral victory, we can banish these radicals once more. Allowing us to attract wayward social liberals and centrists to our cause, disavowing such minor yet vocal radical elements in Sweden will go a long way in improving stability.\n\nAway with such radicals, Sweden’s crown shall foster hope and wealth for all beneath her gaze!"

swedem.13.t:0 "The Folkhemmet Dream Realised"
swedem.13.d:0 "After arduous months upon months, Hansson’s SAP party has achieved what many deemed to be impossible. Using the foundations of capitalism, Hansson has moulded a new humanistic, non-exploitative model within Sweden. Giving welfare to even the poorest in the country, with strict worker protections and unionist rights, to believe the country still maintains itself in the capital sphere is nigh unthinkable. Yet, somehow the SAP have achieved their goal, creating the uniquely Swedish ‘Folkhemmet’, or People’s Home. Alongside this economic miracle, political stability has once again returned to the Riksdag, with favourable debates and discussions allowed, creating a new sense of hope in the Swedish populace. Whether such a people's prioritised market can continue to exist in the long term surrounded by exploitative capitalists is unknown, but what is known is that the Swedish people are ready to stand and fight for their rights once more."

While vital to the agricultural economy, this class of laborers endures harsh conditions, poverty and exploitation, a contraindication to the progress we have thus made as a nation. \n\nThough a complete abolition of the Statare system could risk economic instability, it is crucial that we begin to lift them from their plight. By improving their access to healthcare, education and social support, we can begin to eliminate the deep divisions that persist within our society. This is another large step to fulfilling the dream of a social democratic Sweden, ensuring that all Swedes can love with dignity and equality."

swedem.15.d:0 "In the Swedish political scene sits two parties apart from the general conservative right and the social democratic left. These being the People’s Party and the Farmer’s League, with the People’s party representing a minor group of classical liberalist followers who, during the early 20’s remained a minor ally of ours in championing social reforms. However in recent years they’ve quickly slid towards the right as they directly oppose our policies of nationalization of some private businesses. While they remain firmly against any official form of coalition at this point in time, the Farmer’s league offers another moderate and more politically aligned party. Sitting as a somewhat unofficial coalition member with us, breaking against some of our policies deemed as too ‘socialist’, they remain generally well aligned with us. By formalizing an official coalition with them, we can broaden our government and expand our seats in the Riksdag while better hearing the needs of the smaller farm’s and farmer’s across Sweden."

New fighters are being designed, new ships are planned, military industry is being built near and far, and the government is just hawkish enough to sate the appetites of the more radical members of the 'junta'. As such, after a meeting with fellow officers and members of high society, Jung declares his full support to the governments endeavours. \n\nFor his hard work, the government has already earmarked Jung for the position of Supreme Commander, with the rifts in the army now only a memory.

Calling themselves the National League of Sweden (Sveriges Nationella Förbund), they advocate for a total return to tradition, exclaiming the failings of the current conservatives towards the policies of social democracy. Surrounding themselves with rabid nationalism, with rumours of even integrating ethno-nationalists into their cause, all the other parties consider them flagrant authoritarians biding their time. While still relatively small in numbers, they do pose a threat to the conservatives, drawing members with their erratic and charismatic speeches.

swerev.9999.d:0 "As the Swedish Revolution takes hold, an unfortunate reality has begun to occur. Militants apart from all facets of parties within the revolution have taken the current chaos to their advantage, solving and enacting revenge against old rivals. Looting sprees and large riots are now not uncommon in all cities and towns, as workers and militants take up arms against their perceived enemy. \n\nSome occurrences have reached the President where such groups enact vile acts of violence, against both innocent civilians and reactionary enemies. Such news has gone international, being labeled as the ‘Swedish Red Terror’, emphasized as the failures of the Revolution by reactionary nations, and being downplayed by those within the 3rd Internationale. \n\nWith this in mind, it has come down to the President to make a tough decision. Crackdown on such acts, possibly alienating the more radical and fanatical elements of the revolution. Or constrain perpetrators of the more severe acts committed while turning a blind eye to more minor grievances committed, or most drastic of all merely ignoring international outcry and allowing such mass actions of violence to continue."

In the early hours of the morning, a large detachment of soldiers assembled in front of the Riksdag, their boots echoing ominously across the cobbled streets of Stockholm. At their head stood General Helge Jung, flanked by his trusted allies Carl August Ehrensvärd and Archibald Douglas. The time for veiled threats and tense negotiations had ended. They came to seize power.\n\nAs the soldiers formed ranks, a sudden commotion erupted nearby. Columns of worker militias emerged, some armed with stolen rifles and others wielding hunting weapons or tools converted into makeshift arms. These were not soldiers, but citizens prepared to defend what they saw as their revolution.\n\nFor a tense moment, silence reigned. The military presented its demands to the government: the immediate dissolution of the socialist administration, recognition of the army as the temporary ruling authority, and full disarmament of all worker-aligned militias. The response from Per Albin Hansson’s coalition was swift and defiant. His more radical allies outright rejected the demands, calling them treason.\n\nGunfire broke the stillness. A brutal clash followed in the very heart of the capital. Smoke and shouting filled the square, as the dreams of both sides collided in violence. When the fighting ceased and the last echoes of gunfire faded into the morning fog, a single cry pierced the silence. It signaled not just victory or defeat, but the beginning of a new chapter in Sweden’s turbulent history."

The once-unified revolutionary front, bound together by shared struggle, has begun to fracture as ideological rifts surface in the absence of a common foe. \n\nNew factions are beginning to take shape. The Socialists of the SSV, with their roots in the former electoral system, advocate for a structured socialist republic with popular representation. Opposing them are the syndicalist anarchists, gaining momentum through support from the 3rd Internationale in both arms and ideology, envisioning a stateless, decentralized workers' order. Further still are the hardline national syndicalists and authoritarian communists, united only by their desire for a more militant, centralized revolutionary state.\n\nAs these groups organize and solidify their positions, a new election has been declared.

They seek the proletarianization of the middle class while also uplifting the working class to a higher status. Improving both working conditions and pay for all in Sweden. \n\nBeleiving in a strong cooperation between the small farmers, croppers, tenants and workers, shall create a liberation of agricultural people from capitalist exploitation and oppression. Aside from these, they also hold the position of a statutory ban on drinking. \n\nThey remain as the largest party in terms of active members, giving them a solid chance at yet another electoral victory, albeit within a very different looking Riksdag."

The party sits two headed as of now, one represented by Severin who advocates for a centralised syndicalist model, herelding away from the regular anarchist views, he believes a strong state backed by the unions is the only way for Sweden’s workers to prosper. \n\nThe other head is led by Elise Ottesen-Jensen, seen as the most mainline of the two, her group is best known for the organizations of the most major strikes across the nation, being the most influential group in bringing about the revolution. She maintains the anarchist history of syndicalism, where the workers call to action is the priority of the party, to overthrow and denounce tyrants and despots alike.Holding ties to both Norwegian and Danish trade unions, holding the view of limited government intervention, it deems the purpose of such a body is merely to maintain workers rights and further the international revolution. Seeing a united international revolution as their final goal, they hold big dreams of spreading their ideals outward. \n\nIn a heated debate, Severin and Ottesen-Jensen have come out to demand leadership of the Union, with it simply now in the hands of the members to decide the fate of leadership."

Nils Flyg leads the larger of the two groups, the National Syndicalist Party of Sweden, toeing the lines of syndicalism centred around a strong, sole chairman. Heading ideals from Oswald Mosely’s Totalist Charter, believing in the mass movement of workers, it sees itself as the true vanguard of the revolution, showing little to no compromise with those it sees as decadent reactionaries. Furthering the notion of a Class Rejuvenation, almost creating a near new Totalist middle class, with Nordic conquest ambitions to join it. \n\nThe smaller group is the Communist Party of Sweden, held together by Sven Linderot, they follow the near forgotten ideology of Communism. Seeing themselves as an alternative economic model to the mainstream Syndicalism, they hold views of a strong, sole leader, collectivisation and establishment of a socialist state. Inspired by the Bolsheviks and Soviets of the failed Reds in the Russian Civil War, the party hopes to establish a ‘True Swedish Sovjetisk’ to truly free the working class from reactionary and decadent businessmen. \n\nWhile a victory for such a coalition of radical groups seems unlikely, with the terror and chaos of the revolution, they may just squeeze an unlikely victory."

The SAC believe that their large worker and trade union support base shall give them victory, hoping to draw closer to the 3rd Internationale and creating a true workers paradise! The aloof coalition of Flyg’s National Syndicalists and Linderot’s bygone Communists hold onto hope that their combined numbers and fanatical devotion to the revolution will appeal to the nations workers, giving them power to lead Sweden. \n\nAs the day and ballots draw to a close, the face of the Swedish Revolution shall now be…"

In her stay in Uppsala, she would eventually join a socialist students organisation known as the Swedish Clarté League. During this time she would win the Nordic Nobel prize for her book ‘Astarte’, a criticism of bourgeois culture and society. While suffering from bouts of depression in the early 1930s, she would eventually meet her partner, whom she referred to as her wife, Margot Hanel. Boye would become more involved in the political sphere following this while maintaining a job as a school teacher. She represents a more moderate side of the party, forgowing all tyranny and authoritarianism where it may present itself, while also garnering large support from the women of Sweden. \n\nKarl Kilbom was born and raised into a working class family in Sweden, attending an event headed by a socialist agitator at age 15, in which he would go on to help in the formation of a socialist club. However, threatened by company spies, Kilbom would temporarily revoke the socialist club and its ideals to save his family’s jobs. Conscripted into the Swedish navy in 1907, he would begin to continue joining and participating in socialist and social democrat clubs wherever possible. Eventually joining the Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden who supported the Bolsheviks throughout the Russian civil war. While initially supporting COmmunism, with their defeat, he would turn away from the ideology and swivel between groups like the syndicalists and the social democrats. Eventually becoming a main member of the SSV and one of its leading participants, Karl Kilbom would maintain the party's more revolutionary ideals to keep its independence from the more moderate SAP. Holding staunch revolutionary and socialist ideals, the party remains firm in avoiding any form of authoritarianism."

Seemingly unwilling to break the shackles of an oppressive and traditionalist system shows their undeservedness for serving the revolution. Such weakness and reactionary vision shall not be formed with our government, all final traces of monarchism must, and will be stamped out, for the good of the people."

swerev.17.d:0 "With the revolutionary policies now fully in place, Sweden stands united under a government that serves the people. Workers and farmers are reaping the rewards of their hard-fought gains, alcohol consumption has dropped, and the monarchy’s influence has nearly vanished. The toughest challenges are behind us. The Swedish people are strong, their support unwavering. Our nation, once shackled by royalism and capitalist greed, has emerged as a beacon of socialist success. Sweden is no longer just a country, it is proof that a socialist government can thrive. \n\nAs the Red North rises, Sweden will stand as a symbol to the world—a thriving, independent nation where the people come first, and where socialism is no longer a dream, but a reality."
swerev.17.a:0 "Rest easy workers, your sacrifices have borne fruit!"

swerev.18.t:0 "The Red Farmers"
swerev.18.d:0 "In our initial attempts at winning the election, we drew large support from small farmers across the nation, with a majority located in Lapland. These farmers, under the promises of better conditions, additional aid from the Stockholm government and greater freedom from the larger, traditional farmsteads. With our victory, we must surely begin enacting such policies for one of our essential support bases."
swerev.18.a:0 "Arbetare och småbrukare!"

swerev.19.t:0 "Prohibition Promises"
swerev.19.d:0 "Recently, the discourse over prohibition in Sweden has been reignited. Originally, back in 1921, the SSV ran on the principles of enacting a state-imposed ban on alcohol should it find itself elected into government. These principles have never been sworn away by the party, however with the chaos of the revolution finally at an end, the question has arisen once more. Although the referendum on prohibition in 1922 resulted in a narrow defeat, maintaining the status quo on the sale and licensing of alcohol in Sweden, with the dethroning of the monarchy and radical reforms of the SSV while in charge, the possibility of reintroducing prohibition has sprung up.\n\nPut out as a new referendum, the party will adhere to whatever choice the public makes, whether to once again maintain their status quo or go along the arduous task of prohibition, should they decide that a nationwide prohibition will be enacted under the SSV."

swerev.20.t:0 "Embracing the Swedish Clarté League"
swerev.20.d:0 "The Swedish Clarté League, commonly referred to as the Clarté, was first established in 1921. A small minor group initially started by students is dedicated to advocating for women’s rights and uplifting women in society to an equal position to men. Sitting on the political left, it drastically opposes all fervent nationalist movements, decrying such groups as wanting to bring women back into forced servitude. \n\nSimilarly to this, another group called the Nya Idun, which was established in 1885. Serving as the women’s version of the men made Sällskapet Idun, it advocates for the counterpart to the mens motto of ‘men living in Stockholm who have their own activities and interests in science, literature and art in various fields’. Sitting itself as a feminist forward group to discuss various topics of literature, arts and political views. Our leader, Karin Boye, is a former member of both of these groups. By outreaching to them and merging their ideals into our political apparatus, we could further the women’s cause in Sweden."

The charter speaks of syndicates in every field and factory, of rural communes united in solidarity, and of a people no longer ruled, by ruling themselves. It denounces imperialist aggression and bourgeois democracies, affirming our support for a global revolution of the working class. From Malmö to Kiruna, every Swede shall know, they are no longer subjects but free men and women. \n\nTo our comrades abroad, this Charter is a beacon of solidarity.

swetot.2.t:0 "Lindholm offers his Hand - Rewrite needed"
swetot.2.d:0 "After another shocking victory, Linderot has come out on top against Flyg, however Flyg is not taking no for an answer. Seeing himself as the saviour of the revolution and Linderot as a traitor, Flyg and his men have begun an organised campaign of terror against us. Destroying infrastructure and attempting assassinations on our own people!. We have rallied all we can in destroying this menace, however some still fear a victory may be possible for Flyg, should he kill just the right people. In this, Linderot has received a visitation from someone estranged from the political left, Sven Lindholm. \n\nHeading his own radical yet tiny party called the Swedish Socialist Union, their stance has come into constant question as to whether they are truly socialist to begin with. Holding very little power and sway, they do have a small group of fanatics, willing to do as their leader asks of them. We could use their fanaticism in fighting Flyg, the old saying of ‘Fighting fire with fire’, sending them against Flyg in an attempt to end his tantrum. However many in the party warn Linderot, Lindholm is a young radical, it is unlikely he would present such an offer without some form of benefit to him. Warning that this could be his first step in an attempt to grab power. \n\nWhether such whispers are true is unknown, but we must make a choice now, accept this odd man into our fold, or turn him and his fanatics away?"

swetot.3.d:0 "Reports reached Linderot today, Flyg had been killed and his group was quickly dispersing, either running into hiding or accepting Linderot as the true leader of Sweden. As he was reading over these reports, armed men entered his office. \n\n ‘I’m sorry, what is the meaning of this?’ Linderot expressed confusion, but before he could continue the guards gunned him down, soon only the smell of smoke and gunpowder filled Linderots office. \n\nBehind Linderots back Lindholm had killed Flyg, then coerced his remaining supporters into joining him in overtaking Linderot’s communists. Organizing Flyg’s former men into his own allowed Lindholm to expand his powers, reaching into Linderot’s party and slowly working his own loyal men into as many positions as possible. And with his power all but secured, Lindholm hired the hit on Linderot, the final nail in achieving full control over Sweden. Naturally, Lindholm expressed his sadness over Linderot’s death, pinning the remaining monarchist threat as the perpetrators behind the killing."
swetot.3.a:0 "The National Revolution may finally come"

swetot.4.t:0 "Lindholm's National Revolution"
swetot.4.d:0 "Lindholm, after his sudden grab at power, now wields Sweden with his small band of fanatics, and in the eyes of some is betraying the ideals gained by the recent revolution. Such naysayers cannot all be silent, lest our fragile government topple once more. As such, Lindholm has announced that Sweden is undergoing her second revolution, a true socialist revolution. One not tainted by the syndicalist menace in France and Britain or other nations abroad. \n\nDeclaring that a true ‘Socialist is one who places solidarity with his own people, Sweden, above all’. While such a speech’s effects are yet truly to be felt, many former members of the reactionary ultranationalists have taken a liking to Lindholm’s new revolution, avowing support for his cause. ALongside this, members of Flyg’s former party have quickly incorporated themselves in the party, furthering connections to the wayward socialists. \n\nWhile there is still much to do, and support is still low, the first step has been taken and with it, our victory!"

swetot.5.t:0 "New Red Guard"
swetot.5.d:0 "During the initial days of the revolution, the Red Guard alongside smaller worker militias were formed to combat the military's coup against the rightful government. In time, some of these guardsmen have gone astray and meandered about, squandering their potential by the former government. Now, under Lindholm’s leadership, these militias and guardsmen shall be reorganized into a new formal Red Guard, answering directly to Lindholm and his close officials. Outside of both police and military jurisdiction, they shall act as the righteous fist of our great leader. Smashing and silencing reactionary monarchists and rebellious socialists groups alike."

swetot.6.t:0 "Disintegration of Opposition"
swetot.6.d:0 "It is no surprise that our new regime is rather unpopular to most still, not only to the traditional monarchists that remain in the nation, alongside our former allies on the left. Members of the anarcho-syndicalists have already begun rioting and showing open opposition to our regime, with them are their allies in the SSV who decry our socialism as nothing more than reactionary gibberish! \n\nHowever, with control over Sweden’s military apparatus and soldiers, as well as with the reorganisation of our own Red Guard, such opposition will not last long. Many of the syndicalist strongholds are being hunted down and liquidated. Such woes against us, such provocations, will not go unpunished!"
swetot.6.a:0 "Demand dedication, always"

swetot.7.t:0 "Shaking Hands with General Douglas"
swetot.7.d:0 "After the revolution that took hold of our nation, many generals in the military, especially those involved in the failed coup, either fled the country or were captured and imprisoned until further notice. One such general that failed to avoid capture was the renowned nationalist and proponent of movement warfare, Archibald Douglas. Seen alongside Jung when their soldiers attempted to storm the Riksdag, he was soon captured by a band of worker militias after an intense shootout caused him and his few remaining soldiers to surrender. With his surrender and subsequent imprisonment, he remained in temporary confinement in Långholmen Prison, however upon hearing of Sven Lindholm’s rise into power, he sent an offer towards the new Chairman. \n\nDouglas, ever the ultra-nationalist, has offered Lindholm his services in exchange for the chance to lead the Swedish armed forces once more, declaring that his involvement in the former coup was merely his failed attempt at saving Sweden from the lawless anarchists. Espousing similar nationalist and command economy ideals as Lindholm, the Chairman has found favour in this former radical nationalist clique. Under strict supervision from Lindholm’s most loyal guardsmen, the generals Archibald Douglas and his close friend Martin Ekstroem have been given new titles of Generals in the reformed Swedish army and the chance to redeem themselves from their past sins. \n\nWhile such a move is seen as insane by many on the left, Lindholm’s mishmash of fanatics see this as a national win, that if the possibility to reform such men is possible, then surely the entire nation could be as well. In any case, the Swedish army now stands bolstered with more competent and experienced leadership."
swetot.7.a:0 "If the monarchist can reform, any soul can!"

swetot.8.t:0 "Address to the Nation"
swetot.8.d:0 "Today, in a grand and orchestrated display of national strength, Riksledare Lindholm addressed the people of Sweden with unwavering authority, unveiling the foundations of a new era—one forged in fire, discipline, and destiny. Standing before a sea of flags and a roaring crowd, he declared the drafting of a new national charter, one unlike any the world has seen. Unlike the crumbling constitutions of Britain or the hollow principles of France, Sweden’s new charter will be a testament to her unique spirit—crafted not from borrowed ideals, but from the blood, toil, and will of the Swedish people. \n\nIn his address, Lindholm fiercely condemned the 3rd Internationale and its pitiful doctrine of blind internationalism—calling it not a vision of unity, but a grotesque denial of national identity. He proclaimed that their obsession with borderless brotherhood had led to their moral and structural decay. And when their house of cards inevitably collapses, it will be Sweden—disciplined, unified, and reborn—that shall rise to pick up the shattered remnants of Europe. Not out of charity, but duty. Not in weakness, but in strength. \n\nEspousing a bold vision blending radical nationalist purpose with a reimagined form of Swedish socialism, Lindholm's words struck like lightning—commanding applause, evoking passion, and stirring the very soul of the nation. As his speech came to an end, a thunderous ovation erupted—thousands of voices united as one, echoing his vision across the capital and beyond.\n\nThe world now gazes upon Sweden with awe, fear, and fascination. No longer the placid, democratic monarchist bastion of yesteryear, our nation has been reborn as a blazing pillar of social-nationalist resolve. Under the watchful eye of the Riksledare, Sweden stands proud; unyielding, sovereign, and ready to shape the destiny of a crumbling continent."

For too long, the minds of Swedes have been bound by superstition, first through the blood-soaked rites of Norse paganism and later through the long, grim shadow cast by Christianity. From the moment the cross was hoisted above our temples and altars, a darkness fell across Sweden, a darkness of submission, guilt, and blind obedience to invisible masters. \n\nBut no longer. The age of divine lies is ending. \n\nThough many still cling desperately to these irrational beliefs, nurtured by generations of indoctrination and fear, the time has come to begin the great therapy of truth. Religion is the opioid of a dying world—a crutch for the weak, a tool for the exploiters—and we shall see it cast down, broken and discredited. The revolution has no place for fairy tales and ghosts; its altar is reason, and its scripture is strength. \n\nThis will not be an easy struggle. The parasite of faith has deep roots. But we know the path is righteous, and we do not waver. Through education, through will, through the ceaseless flame of ideological clarity, we shall purge the final vestiges of religious delusion from our people. In the end, no Swede shall bow to heaven, nor to prophets, nor to gods. They shall bow only to the Revolution—and to the Chairman, the living embodiment of Sweden’s destiny!"

Then we raised our crimson banner over the Riksdag, and showed our superior ideology over our fellow revolutionaries. We mended the cracks in our party, electing a chairman true to our ideals. And with it all, we have done our best for the Swedish worker, from their blood and sweat great cities have been raised, weapons made to spread our vision across borders and seas built by their hands. In this we have succeeded, with reactionaries crushed, every worker giving their absolute loyalty to both the party and the chairman. \n\nOur revolution can rest for a moment, soon, the world shall see our vision, for every worker will be liberated!"

However, since the civil war ended in the failure of the Russian socialists and the emerging of Syndicalism in France and Britain, Flyg shifted the parties ideology slightly to bring abroad more syndicalist aligned voters. \n\nNow with his dream of bringing about a revolution to Sweden realised, Nils Flyg now finds himself in contact once more with the famed Russian Revolutionary Nikolai Bukharin, who reached out once hearing about Flyg’s rise to power. After some weeks of communication, a blooming penpal friendship has emerged between the two men, both believing in a coming international revolution and discussing their shared ideals. \n\nBukharin however differs in specifics of ideology, while Flyg has towed towards the lines of Syndicalism but still conserving some signatures of Communism, Bukharin has proposed his own form of socialism. Coined as ‘Bukharinism’ or ‘Socialism in the City, Capitalism in the Village’, this ideology has garnered support in Russia amongst Bukharin's supporters. While a novel idea, most within Flyg’s cabinet believe such economic proposals are not feasible or viable for Sweden and her revolution. A small section however, including some from the SSV believe incorporating Bukharin's economic plans into Sweden could produce great results. \n\nThe choice now comes down to the Chairman, to maintain the current party's line of National Syndicalism for Sweden, or to diverge towards Bukharin’s vision in the Nordic realm?"

Currently no official intelligence agency exists in Sweden, with the closest thing fitting it being the Statspolisen (State Police), however their powers are extremely limited and lack funding. With this in mind, our new government has planned out a vast expansion of this wing, creating an official intelligence agency, called the ‘General Security Service’. This shall allow us to monitor calls, allowing us to snuff out dissidents and revolutionaries still hiding within Sweden.

With this blatant act of betraying the Swedish nation and attempting to plunge it into the arms of the 3rd Internationale, Sweden’s Army must now restore order, declaring martial law. Many in Sweden are shocked at this announcement, with many more world wide stunned at both the near possibility of revolution in Scandinavia, as well as the end of Swedish democracy. \n\nRiots and large demonstrations have now sprung up across the nation, with those from both the SAP and SSV calling this an outrageous betrayal of democracy. Former King Gustav V has been relatively silent on the whole situation, while his son and former crown prince Gustav Adolf has expressed sympathies towards Helge Jung, publicly endorsing the army's declaration of martial law as a necessity to save Sweden from those who would wish to erode her traditions. Whether this endorsement will do much to shift public opinion is unknown, more so if Jung’s junta will even restore the former monarchy back to its throne.

As such, another candidate has been found, the relatively young Duke of Västerbotten, Prince Gustaf Adolf. Openly sympathetic to our cause and beliefs, has expressed his desire to be crowned king of Sweden, owing such a position to us would all but guarantee his loyalty. \n\nSuch a puppet would allow us to reignite our relations with the formerly disgraced moderate right, allowing the monarchy to be used once more as a symbol of Sweden to unite her people. If the monarchy was restored however, it would be unlike its previous iteration, the new king would hold no power, with the current military state maintaining its current control over government.

The monarchy that was unceremoniously cast aside by the traitorous syndicalst regime in Parisian imitation, is to be restored. This decision, made by the High Command and sanctioned by the Jung Junta, marks a return to Sweden’s rightful traditions. \n\nYet, the throne cannot remain empty. A sovereign must be chosen. \n\nOne might expect the heir apparent, Prince Oscar Adolf, eldest son of the exiled King Gustav V, to reclaim his birthright. But such hopes are in vain. Oscar Adolf, having grown sympathetic to liberal democrats abroad and advocating for a return to a constitutional monarchy, has alienated himself from the military. \n\nThe attention of the Junta has thus turned to his son Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten. A man molded by discipline and driven by fervent Swedish nationalism, Gustaf Adolf has expressed an unwavering commitment to our new regime. His youth and ideological alignment with the Jung Junta make him an ideal symbol of a revitalized Sweden, traditional, united, and strong.\n\nHowever, not all within the armed forces are aligned behind the young Duke. A second name has emerged, Count Folke Bernadotte of Wisborg, a man of noble blood and diplomatic prowess. Known for his humanitarian efforts and close ties within aristocratic and international circles, Bernadotte commands respect among the officer corps, particularly those outside the inner circle of the Junta. His moderate views and experience suggest a king who could stabilize the nation and perhaps reintroduce Sweden onto the world stage diplomatically. Yet, he has never voiced strong support for the nationalist ideals now driving our military government. \n\nThe choice is delicate. One candidate is a banner for the new Sweden, loyal to the regime and molded for national rebirth. The other is a seasoned leader, capable of healing wounds and legitimizing our rule both at home and abroad, but potentially a threat to the ideological purity of our cause."

The Jung 'Junta', now an actual proper junta, have declared their intentions to bring back the monarchy. Not content to invite back the line that sold Sweden down the river of inept politics, Jung, Douglas and Ehrensvärd have all decided upon a good substitute: Their friend Folke. \n\nAlthough disinherited due to his father marrying someone of lower standing, Folke Bernadotte would make an excellent king in their eyes. Friendly to everyone, diplomatic, not too ambitious and broadly liked by the population as a whole, him becoming king is not a hard ask at all. Indeed, although disinherited, that can simply be brushed aside as another poorly thought out action by the past ruling line. Already Folke is learning to no longer refer to himself as 'Folke af Wisborg', the title used for disinherited Swedish royals, and is gradually adjusting to his position of king. Indeed, Folke is also beginning to assert his independence over the more radical members of the Junta, like Douglas, intending to be made king with the consent of the people, rather than without. That said, no king has ever been named Folke in the past, and as such Folke and his burgeoning court must sort out the growing issue of his regal name. \n\nThere are a few options on the table, ranging from the more traditional to the more radical. First option is to simply name Folke Carl, like past kings before him. Second option is to name him after his father and grandfather, king Oscar II. Third option is to shatter expectations, and let Folke rule by his own given name. "

Currently Helge Jung remains the leader of Sweden, guiding her since the military’s coup of the former socialist government, however some have come to question if he is the right man for the job moving forward. Jung himself is a general first and foremost, and should he be chosen to continue leading will likely double down on his policies of national defense, militarisation of Swedish society and uplifting the Army above all else in Sweden. \n\nOn the other hand is Carl Ehrensvärd, a close ally of Jung and general, considered more moderate in his outlook should he find himself governing Sweden. With a bias towards the members of the Entente, alongside connections to those in the Electoral league in the former Riksdag, he would maintain the military's authority while bringing back many of the civilian politicians from the Electoral league and People’s Party. \n\nIn the final camp sits Archibald Douglas, considered more politically involved than the other two men, known to frequent nationalist clubs and groups, Douglas upholds a more expressional view on Swedish nationalism. Alongside Martin Ekström, another prominent military figure, they lead a small group known as the Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti (National Unity Party of the Swedish Realm), dominated by generals and the upper class, the group advocate for Swedish expansionism and the belief in Swedish exceptionalism. With views not too dissimilar to that of the Iron Guard in Romania, the group has largely been unheard of or unseen due to its limited support base. Now with the chance at national leadership, the group has formalised as an official political organisation, branching out to disenfranchised conservatives. \n\nA choice must now be made that shall shape the direction of Sweden’s military government, and Iron fist under the military mind of Jung?

swemil.9.d:0 "Within Douglas’s own party lie numerous smaller groups with slight variations in ideology. While all these groups swear allegiance to Douglas due to their rather limited public support, one such group under the charismatic Elmo Lindholm has come forward with a proposition. Elmo Lindholm, under his own group called the Sveriges Nationella Förbund, or Sweden’s National Federation, once led the youth movement under the General Electoral League. However due to the youth’s increasing radicalism towards the right in face of rising syndicalism in Europe, they were expelled from the AV and a new youth organisation was formed. However, some remained under Elmo’s leadership, continuing to follow his ideals. \n\nThese ideals were molded from his visits with the famous, or infamous, Charles Maurras and the recently deceased Rudolf Kjellén. Such figures formulated Elmo’s own ideological view, one where the King holds a necessary place in society in which hierarchy is enforced, royal corporatism is employed and anti-democratic views become prevalent. \n\nNow with a formal meeting between him and Douglas, he can finally propose his plan to the Riksledare. Granting Elmo position as the honorary Riksledare, allowing Douglas to maintain most of his control, in return for Elmo to enact more of his Maurrasism policies. While Douglas could easily oust this man in favour of maintaining the current status quo, Elmo’s connections to groups in the exiled National French State, some members of the northern Italian breakaway states and in Spain could prove favourable should he be given the position.

While Martin is far from revolting should his request be denied, since both him and Douglas shared membership of the same nationalist bloc, such a move would change little in the position of government policy.

Once the figurehead of Sweden’s short-lived National Socialist movement, Furugård has since faded into obscurity, living quietly as a provincial veterinarian in Värmland. Now, it seems, Furugård has returned to the political stage in typically unorthodox fashion. The contents of his letter are nothing short of feverish. Furugård implores the Riksledare to grant him sweeping powers, claiming he can rally a pan-European network of national revolutionaries under Sweden’s leadership. He name-drops a bizarre and troubling list of figures like Sven Olov Lindholm, an elusive Swedish radical; Joseph Darnand of the French Legionary Order; the Romanian Iron Guard’s Horia Sima; even the exiled French-Canadian demagogue Adrian Arcand. Furugård believes Sweden stands at a historic crossroads, and that with the correct ideological alignment, she could become the guiding star of a new nationalist international.\n\nThe letter mixes vague threats with promises of glory, paramilitary support from abroad, secret legions waiting to rise, and a utopian vision of a regenerated Europe under Swedish oversight. Most of these claims are unverifiable, and his rhetoric borders on delusional if not outright dangerous.\n\nAnd yet, within the ravings, there may be a kernel of truth. Several of the groups he mentions are real, and Sweden, isolated and uncertain in the post-Weltkrieg order, may soon need allies, however unsavory.

Being seen as one of the most determined men in the Generals corp, he has now risen atop the ranks as the sole leader of Sweden. Uniting rightist elements from the former General electoral league while also unleashing the radical paramilitaries under Douglas against the socialists and syndicalists. \n\nHis cementation of leadership marks a straightforward path for Sweden, characterised by a heavy focus on national defence, flexible foreign policy and action against any red elements that try to surround Sweden.

Many from the People’s Party and General Electoral League remain silent on the continued arrests, with the most outspoken joining the ranks of those imprisoned. \n\nHowever, General Martin Ekstroem has put forward a proposal to Helge Jung. Claiming that at the current rate of arrests, most of the former politicians will be able to flee Sweden and form exile governments in supportive nations, undermining the Junta’s legitimacy as the sole Swedish government.

As the two ladies made a series of disparaging remarks about their third, who was absent from the event, one of the ladies asked Jung what he thought about the missing third. 'Surely she's not all bad?' the lady asked Jung. 'I do not know, I haven't been that deep in her.' \n\nAlthough blaming the comment on too much gin and far too little tonic, it's clear Jung simply cannot handle himself in public, and as such, perhaps it's best he take a step back, to continue his rule over the junta in the background?

However, Douglas has long harbored sympathies for ultranationalist elements that now operate beyond the Army’s direct control. These groups, forged into paramilitary bands during the civil unrest, proved useful in routing the final remnants of socialist militias. But in the months since, they’ve grown increasingly reckless, disobeying orders, committing atrocities, and threatening the discipline of the restored Swedish state.\n\nNow, Jung moves to reassert full control.

Bagge, now at the head of a revitalized National Organization of the Right, reborn from the ashes of the old General Electoral League, has positioned himself as a staunch advocate for a constitutional restoration. While King Gustaf VI has been allowed to serve in a ceremonial role, true authority remains elusive, held tightly by the generals and their inner circle.\n\nStill, a possible concession could mark a tentative turning point. With careful statesmanship and national unity, Bagge hopes to slowly reclaim Sweden’s democratic traditions, extinguished but not forgotten.

swemil.32.t:0 "Guided by the Most Loyal"
swemil.32.d:0 "The fires of revolution remain as nothing but withering embers, buried beneath the iron discipline of the Swedish Armed forces. After Carl August Ehrensvärd was voted in as Commander of the nation, he went about transforming Sweden, maintaining the republican order.Under his leadership, the Swedish army transformed as the violent force that oppressed workers into men who have tried their best to rebuild Sweden from the aftermath of chaos. With the return to stability, many thought a return to parliamentary rule was guaranteed, however Ehrensvärd knows the embers could easily reignite at a moment's notice. As such, maintaining military rule is a necessity, to avoid the chaos of recent years. While a future of civilian government remains possible, it's in the far future down the road, and for now Sweden shall be led by iron discipline and unitary government.

Under the resolute leadership of Carl August Ehrensvärd, the socialist uprising was crushed, and in its place, a new Sweden began to take shape, one founded on stability, unity, and national discipline.\n\nWith the chaos subdued, the people yearned for order, but the old monarchy was deemed a relic unfit for the new era. Instead, the Swedish Armed Forces established a military junta republic, consolidating power under a council of high-ranking officers led by Ehrensvärd. Civilian governance was partially restored, with a tightly controlled parliament and limited press freedoms, offering a veneer of normalcy to a nation exhausted by strife.\n\nYet beneath this facade of republican stability, the military's grip remains unyielding. Ehrensvärd, as Commander of the Nation, wields supreme authority, his influence permeating every facet of the state. The civilian cabinet functions, but only with the junta’s tacit approval. Parliamentary debates are permitted, but within strict boundaries set by the military council. Sweden is no longer burning, but it is firmly under the disciplined hand of its generals.\n\nThis new order is neither the chaotic republic of yesterday nor the monarchy of old. It is a disciplined hybrid, a military junta republic, tempered by controlled civilian structures, a nation guided by the unwavering loyalty of its armed forces."

swemil.34.t:0 "Swedish Integral Nationalism"
swemil.34.d:0 "Initially forming the youth league for the General electoral League, Elmo Lindholm’s group broke away due to their increasing radicalism, distancing them from the moderate conservative party they were meant to represent. From this, it seems amongst the swathes of ragtag ultranationalists in Sweden, Elmo Lindholm has emerged her victor, with grand promises in tow. Denouncing all forms of socialism and leftism, while also going against any form of republicanism in Sweden as ‘UnSwedish’, fanatical monarchists and military higherups form the basis of his supporters, alongside his radical youth league that once conjoined with the AV. \n\nIdeologically, Lindholm follows the ways of the French philosopher and ideologue, Charles Maurass. Maurass’s own ideology, formed amongst his close supporters, advocates for decentralisation of a nation. Turning provincial departments into minor governments overseen by a central authority under a monarch. Focusing on its agrarian base, it institutes ‘Royal Capitalism’ as a method to curb capitalism’s growth and retain majority of power once again in the crown. Seen as dictatorial by its detractors, Maurass’s supporters decry these accusations, claiming that true liberty is found under the crown and regionalism, however a central government remains to curb anarchists and dissenters from fracturing a country, turning her people away from their God given monarch. \n\nNow under the new party title ‘Sweden’s National Federation’, Lindholm and his group of monarchists hope to reshape Swedish society once more."
swemil.34.a:0 "Lindholm? Could it be..."

swemil.35.t:0 "The Catholic Conundrum"
swemil.35.d:0 "It seems the voices of our detractors have both grown louder and wider, with even some wayward monarchists denouncing our current style of government. The main argument against us, bar the usual from the socialists and anarchists, is the basis of our government, Catholicism. Sweden remains as a predominant protestant country, while catholics hold some majority in minor areas, they form a small minority at their greatest. As such, Maurassism bases itself upon Catholicism, proclaiming Church, Crown and nation as its key three principles, principles that define the thought amongst the swathes of monarchist ideologies across the globe. Alongside this Charles Maurass himself espouses strong anti-protestant ideals, confirming the stance of no salvation outside of the catholic church, this goes against the mainline Protestant nature of Sweden. \n\nThese clashes between the Protestant nature of Sweden and the Catholicism of our ideology, while Lindholm holds that the system itself is not dependent on Catholicism. However, tensions between the majority Protestant nation over the idea that their country be run by catholics has only been growing, and soon a choice may need to be made."
swemil.35.a:0 "Fy fan!"

swemil.36.t:0 "The Eclipse of the Crisis"
swemil.36.d:0 "It would seem the crisis around the Catholic nature of our governance has come ahead, with infighting between the Protestant majority and Catholic members. Elmo Lindholm sits at the assembly, poorly getting a word in as fights and disputes over the most minor decisions continue, with any push by the Catholics seen as an attempt to erase Swedish Protestant culture. While some of the Protestants have made vague bills that directly target and tax the Catholic church. To mend this divide in the party, Lindholm has summoned all members in an attempt to decide and finalize the future of the party’s approach. The easiest path forward would be to maintain the current ideological framework by Charles Maurass, enforcing it amongst the party with some slight tweaks, no longer enforcing its Catholic priority. An alternative choice presented is the somewhat vague ideology of ‘Neo-Feudalism’, with near identical views to ours, it shifts in the notions of a more warrior based culture. One where a strict hierarchy is the main priority of the government, where most authority is placed upon the monarch, with regions headed by lords and counts that swear total allegiance to the King. On the other end sits Integralism, another similar foundational ideology, with the diverged focus on the Church itself within the government apparatus. Combining rigid hierarchy with meritocracy, it espouses the authority of the King and Church as vital to the nation, as such placing the Church of Sweden alongside the King in government. \n\nWith such choices presented, and their benefits and negatives weighed up accordingly, it is Elmo Lindholm with the King’s approval to choose."
swemil.36.a:0 "Maurass’s ways are sound, remain as is"
swemil.36.b:0 "We shall revive the medieval era, Feudalism!"
swemil.36.c:0 "All towards the crown, Integral nationalism!"

swemil.37.t:0 "Maurrassism Entrenched"
swemil.37.d:0 "After deliberation and debate within the ruling assembly, Elmo Lindholm has emerged from the ideological storm with a clear verdict, the doctrine of Charles Maurras shall remain the guiding light of the Swedish state.\n\nThough heavily rooted in Catholic traditionalism, Lindholm has sanctioned revisions to the framework, adapting its principles to Sweden’s Protestant character. The result is a uniquely Swedish variant of Maurrassism: a staunchly hierarchical society grounded in monarchism, anti-parliamentarianism, and cultural nationalism.\n\nThe King, while still adorned in royal finery and spoken of as the living symbol of the nation, now acts at the discretion of Lindholm’s inner circle. The monarchy is sacred, yes, but sacred under supervision. The democratic institutions of the old era remain abolished or neutered, replaced with a centralized state apparatus designed to enforce discipline, unity, and national will.\n\nThe Church, though no longer privileged above all, remains under close watch. It is tolerated so long as it serves the vision of the state, not the other way around.\n\nWith Maurrassism now codified into law and governance, Lindholm has achieved what few have in Sweden’s long history, an ideologically unified regime with one will, one voice, and one destiny."
swemil.37.a:0 "The nation stands united without room for dissent."

swemil.38.t:0 "Revival of the Medieval Era"
swemil.38.d:0 "The return to a feudal order has rekindled a long-dormant fire in the hearts of the Swedish people. Tradition, once buried beneath layers of modern bureaucracy, now emerges resplendent in steel, silk, and ceremony. Members of the King’s personal guard no longer wear only the crisp blue of the modern era, they now don suits of plate armor inspired by the knights of old, marching in parades with lances raised high and banners unfurled.\n\nThough largely symbolic, these displays of medieval grandeur have sparked a cultural renaissance. Officers in the army now carry ceremonial swords once more, and many wear the uniforms of generations past, some tracing back to ancestors who fought under Gustavus Adolphus himself. The old gives way to the older, and a new aesthetic age takes root.\n\nThe Riksdag has been formally abolished, and in its place, construction has begun on a towering royal citadel, a castle worthy of kings, forged not merely in stone but in myth and legacy. Within its halls, Elmo Lindholm has established a powerful royal court, populated by loyal nobles, ideologues, and trusted officers. Though the King remains head of state, his role is increasingly ceremonial, gently swayed by Lindholm’s courtly whispers.\n\nTo the average Swede, life may continue much the same, for now. But these changes mark the dawn of something deeper: a romanticized return to blood, crown, and soil. Sweden will not be dictated to. She will decide her fate, in armor, with banners flying."
swemil.38.a:0 "Prepare, Arms!"

swemil.39.t:0 "The Church’s Newfound Authority"
swemil.39.d:0 "The rise of integral nationalism has reshaped not only the structure of the state but also the soul of the nation. Nowhere is this shift more evident than in the newfound political stature of the Church. Once viewed as a largely apolitical institution, aligned loosely with centrism or the quiet traditions of the monarchy, the clergy now find themselves drawn into the heart of power.\n\nWith many high-ranking clerics pledging loyalty to Lindholm and his vision for a unified Sweden, the Church has been elevated to an unofficial pillar of state. Though King Gustaf remains the symbolic sovereign and Lindholm his ever-faithful executor, it is increasingly the Church that provides the ideological backbone of this new Sweden.\n\nSunday services have begun to change. Soldiers in uniform attend mass in growing numbers, often seated near the front as honored symbols of state and faith. Sermons now intertwine scripture with speeches on duty, unity, and obedience. The line between pulpit and podium fades by the week.\n\nAs this sacred institution shifts to echo the voice of the state, questions linger. Is this a revival of faith, or a repurposing of it? Is the Church guiding the nation, or is it being guided itself?"
swemil.39.a:0 "God Save Sweden"

swemil.40.t:0 "Recreating the Royal Guard"
swemil.40.d:0 "Under previous governments, the Royal Guard had become little more than an ornament, soldiers in polished boots and bright sashes, parading through the streets during galas and state visits. Their duties were ceremonial, their weapons largely for show. But in Elmo Lindholm’s Sweden, there is no room for decoration without purpose.\n\nThe government has moved swiftly to repurpose the institution, merging it with the most loyal paramilitary elements that fought to secure the regime. These men, hardened, disciplined, and utterly devoted to the nation’s new order, will now don the title of Royal Guard not as symbols of tradition, but as enforcers of loyalty and strength.\n\nClad in uniforms that blend regal tradition with the austere practicality of modern warfare, the new Royal Guard will serve both as the personal protectors of the King and as Lindholm’s shield against dissent. Their presence in the capital is unmistakable, a reminder that while the crown may shine in public, it is the blade behind it that keeps Sweden stable.\n\nThe age of ceremonial pageantry is over. The Royal Guard marches once more, not for spectacle, but for power."
swemil.40.a:0 "Let loyalty wear steel once again."

swemil.41.t:0 "A Vision in Flat-Pack"
swemil.41.d:0 "In the quiet forests of Småland, a young entrepreneur named Ingvar Kamprad has founded a small mail-order company by the name of IKEA. Selling everyday household goods at affordable prices, Kamprad's business model emphasizes efficiency, simplicity, and accessibility, a sharp contrast to the traditional, expensive furniture markets.\n\nThough still modest in scale, IKEA represents a new spirit of Swedish innovation and frugality, values that may one day shape not only domestic life, but the Swedish economy at large. For now, it is just a name. But to those who watch closely, it may be the beginning of something far greater."
swemil.41.a:0 "A promising future for Swedish industry."
swemil.41.b:0 "A brilliant mind, bring him into government!"

swemil.42.t:0 "Elmo Flag chooser"
swemil.42.d:0 "As the soon to be sole rulers of Europe, we must design a flag fit for our emerging Kingdom. And for that, Riksledare Lindholm has put forth a national competition for our new flag. \n\nUnder this, three options have captured the leaders eyes, all adorned with purple, the colour of European royalty and with a large circle of Fleur de Lys shown in a golden yellow. The differences arise in that the first option most signifies Swedish supremacy over this new empire with the three crowns inside a roundel in Sweden's national colours. Second is a similar design but without the roundel around the crowns. The final option places the crowns in the top left corner. \n\nThe final choice is..."

swemil.43.t:0 "A Telegram from Stockholm"
swemil.43.d:0 "An unusual telegram has arrived from the Swedish government in Stockholm. Headed by the nations leader, Carl Ehrensvärd, it has proposed an olive branch to the Entente. Showing affection and admiration for the alliance, proposing mutually beneficial trade deals as well as aid to either nation. While a direct entry into the Entente is not proposed in the telegram, it also does not exclude such a possibility. We are now given the choice of sending some aid to their recovering nation after the attempted revolution, or deny them of such. Denying them will alienate them from the Entente, but Sweden could also pose a burden to the alliance."
swemil.43.a:0 "Send the aid, we extend in kind"

swemil.44.t:0 "A Response"
swemil.44.d:0 "It would seem the powers within the Entente have responded in kind! Sending some military and financial aid our way, alongside offering new trade deals between our nations. This will go a long way in both improving Sweden’s stability and growing our foreign relations with the Entente!"
swemil.44.a:0 "God save the Entente!"

swemil.45.t:0 "A Response"
swemil.45.d:0 "Unfortunately, our plea to the Entente has been denied. Appreciating our valiant effort to establish better relations, the Entente seem focused on their goals of Reclamation. This tunneled vision view may be their befal, however we must now move forward without the Entente."
swemil.45.a:0 "A sad state of foreign affairs"

swemil.46.t:0 "Thörnell, the loyalist"
swemil.46.d:0 "Stiff and cold, harsh and sarcastic, Thörnell is not liked by his subordinates. Viewed as merely an incompetent 'chair warmer' by the Jung 'Junta', viewed as a bloodthirsty white by the SSV, Thörnell remains in his position as Supreme Commander thanks to his good relations with the government. Believed to not be too ambitious to cause a fuss with the government, but not lax enough to keel over under stress, the government believes him to be the ideal head of the army, even though Gösta Bagge privately loathes him. \n\nA friend of Germany, and also a friend of the exiled French in Africa, Thörnell is worried about the growing threat of revolution, but does not believe SAP to be the harbinger of said societal upheaval. This puts him at odds with the increasingly radical 'Jungjunta', who believe that the SAP will simply open the door to further military cuts, followed shortly by socialist overthrow of both army and state. Perhaps the biggest trait he has, besides being deemed distant and uncharismatic, is his cold calm demeanour. Indeed, as much as the 'Junta' dislikes him, they too believe that he's as calm as a rock during times of unrest. Perhaps too calm."
swemil.46.a:0 "Our guy in the army"

swemil.47.t:0 "A Return to the Old Order"
swemil.47.d:0 "Despite repression of many political dissidents, an official declaration of the Junta and the appointment of  Ehrensvärd, many in Sweden and across the globe still denounce our government as illegitimate. Even as Ehrensvärd has embraced a few of the former conservative elements, we still struggle with issues of legitimacy. As such, some within our cabinet have proposed an idea to help our legitimacy, an old institution made new. By restoring and calling our government the Riksrådet or Privy Council of Sweden, an order from the medieval period of Sweden. The Riksrådet was once an advisory and co-ruling position alongside the King of Sweden. Whether we have a King or not, such an institution and return, could bring back legitimacy from history, a return to our true traditional government roots. Although such a proposal could work, others in our government call such a move as meaningless and a waste of time, and that such a name change remains unnecessary for now. Whatever we choose, it must be made now."
swemil.47.a:0 "Change it, we shall embrace our past!"
swemil.47.b:0 "Change it and fully embrace our past, restoring the Privy Council!"
swemil.47.c:0 "There is no need for a medieval change"

### Intro Events ###

swe.9999.t:0 "A Past of Stable Democracy"
swe.9999.d:0 "Throughout the Weltkrieg Sweden remained as a neutral power, even with pro-German sentiment in both her political scene and within the nobility, she retained a stance of Armed Neutrality for the entirety of the conflict. The Post-Weltkrieg era was marked with increasing German influence on the northern nation, large businesses from Germany securing vital trade with Sweden. Alongside the expanding German giant below, Sweden’s political scene benefited from a semblance of stability, with the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921, allowing for early general elections in which the first female MPs were sworn into the Riksdag which allowed for a Social Democratic victory. \n\nHowever luck would change when unemployment would rise due to economic downturns in 1924 when the United Kingdom would collapse in revolution, with this stark rise in Syndicalism and leftism, allowing for a conservative victory in the 1928 election under Arvid Lindman. Lindman would continue this legacy of conservatism in the European North until after his sudden resignation in 1935. This left the General Electoral League, the largest conservative party in Sweden, with the new leader Gösta Bagge who now leads the nation into the 1936 elections. \n\nWith growing international tensions, as both the exiled Entente, Japanese Empire and Third Internationale all seek to reclaim or conquer new territories, the next election shall be vital in defining Sweden’s place on the world stage"

swe.1.t:0 "Black Monday Arrives in Sweden"
swe.1.d:0 "Two weeks ago, the German stock market imploded and now the waves have come crashing to our shores as first the Stockholmsbörsen followed the fate that played out in Berlin and soon after the rest of the economy followed suit.\nSince the Weltkrieg, Sweden has become highly dependent on German trade, joining its organisation of Mitteleuropa together with Denmark. As such, our trade relations became increasingly one-sided, being aimed at countries in the tariff-free zone: Germany, Denmark and the German puppet states on the Baltic coast, at the cost of other trading partners such as Norway and Great Britain, with whom trading is subject to tariffs, or, in the latter case, even embargoes."
swe.1.a:0 "Herre min skapare!"

swe.2.t:0 "Per Albin Hansson Criticizes Our Crisis Response"
swe.2.d:0 "Per Albin Hansson, leader of the Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Arbetareparti (SAP) and widely considered to be the foremost leader of the opposition, has sharply condemned the Bagge-cabinet’s response to the ongoing economic upheaval, calling their faith in non-intervention dangerous and damaging to Sweden.\nHe once again has called out in favour of his own ‘Folkhemmet’ program that he claims will actually protect those that have lost their jobs to the crisis originating in Germany."
swe.2.a:0 "We are doing what we can!"

swe.3.t:0 "Rising SSV Membership"
swe.3.d:0 "Although the opposition is clearly led by the SAP, two smaller parties are active as well: the Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) which would identify as radical socialists who are strongly in favour of the cause of the so-called Third Internationale and the Bondeförbundet, a social liberal centrist party.\nEspecially the former party is seeing sharp increases in its membership over the years as the social democratic failure to dethrone the perpetual conservative government causes radicalisation amongst its ranks."
swe.3.a:0 "We can only welcome the left fracturing!"

swe.4.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Supports the Bagge Cabinet"
swe.4.d:0 "Long-time prime minister and former leader of the Allmänna Valmansförbundet (AV/General Electoral League) Arvid Lindman has publicly spoken out in favour of the government, declaring his utmost faith in Bagge and rallying voters to support the party he used to lead to the polls.\nLindman has ruled Sweden from 1906 to 1911 and then ruled continuously from 1924 until his retirement in 1934. Many consider his charismatic personality the foremost reason that the conservatives did not lose control to the social democrats like in Denmark. Many doubt whether Bagge will similarly be able to conserve General Electoral League dominance in Swedish politics, and many view the elections of 1936 - the first elections with Bagge as the conservative leader - as influential in determining this."
swe.4.a:0 "Thank you, old friend!"

swe.5.t:0 "SAP Refuses to Rule out Cooperation with Radicals"
swe.5.d:0 "Shocking news as Hansson refuses to rule out the formation of a coalition with the SSV if the outcome would be so that it would be the most democratic to do so.\nThe SSV’s open desire to end the Swedish system as it is in favour of a socialist form of government like in France and Britain (though with Swedish characteristics as outlined in their party program) causes the utmost concern amongst those in the right wing."
swe.5.a:0 "The SAP shows its true colors!"

swe.6.t:0 "A Vote for the SAP Is a Vote for Paris!"
swe.6.d:0 "As a result of the news that the social democrats are open to cooperation with outright radicals, the General Electoral League has started a propaganda war. They openly target SAP voters, claiming the SAP supports the Third Internationale and that any vote for them would directly correlate to a vote for the syndicalist regime in France.\nDespite a sharp SAP rebuke of this rhetoric, and while few actual SAP voters will be swayed by this, it does seem to have successfully played on the emotions of the liberal Folkpartiet voters to the League, who start to consider the SAP a very real danger to their fortunes. They start to see the AV as a much more capable faction to stand up against the SAP’s wicked plans than the Folkpartiet."
swe.6.a:0 "Nothing personal, Andersson..."

swe.7.t:0 "Debate over the Military Expenses"
swe.7.d:0 "As the election approaches, and Gösta Bagge and his minister have to consider the very real possibility of a potential defeat, the government has scheduled a debate to approve at least the Swedish budget of 1936 with the current Riksdag. The Bagge cabinet seeks to maintain the heavy investments in the military to which the social democratic opposition is heavily opposed, claiming that there is no direct threat to Sweden at this time and that the money would be better spent elsewhere to make the lives of Swedes better. The conservatives try to counter to this by arguing that the global tensions are rising and that worrisome events in Norway and Finland could directly threaten Sweden in the future. The government holds a majority in the Riksdag so the budget will definitely pass, but the prevailing argument could bring the party that brings it up closer to electoral victory in the coming elections.\nExperts agree that..."
swe.7.a:0 "...the opposition completely trashed the budget proposal."

swe.7.c:0 "...the Folkpartiet saved Bagge from a disgrace."

swe.8.t:0 "1936 Swedish Riksdag Elections"
swe.8.d:0 "The election campaign of 1936 has been dominated by underhanded tactics, stirred up emotions and thinly veiled threats. At this point, the only certainty is that whoever will stand victorious after this election will need to cooperate with others to secure a majority. If the Social Democrats stand to be victorious and they would follow through with their threat to cooperate with the SSV, serious trouble is to be expected. If the conservatives win instead, Bagge will secure his position as the carrier of Lindman’s legacy, but doubt will undoubtedly be sowed about the legitimacy of this election by disgruntled socialists."

During the campaign already, we left the door open to work together with the radically socialist SSV, which will likely be the most straightforward path to achieving socialism by democratic means, but it would be a major upset and is likely to bring the Swedish right up in arms. Alternatively, we could form an alliance with the agrarian Bondeförbundet: this would likely require compromise on our vision, but it wouldn't nearly polarise Swedish politics as much.\n\nWhichever option we choose, Lindman's conservative era seems finally behind us and a new Sweden shall rise from it!"

If we are to form a government we shall have to cooperate with one of the other parties: either we could continue the Bagge I cabinet by continuing our cooperation with the liberal Folkpartiet with whom we can find strong agreement on economic matters, or we could agree to form a coalition with the agrarian Bondeförbundet, which might be a better match on the social aspect of governance."

swe.11.d:0 "One of the conditions of the SSV was that the monarchy be abolished. According to them, this ancient institution was a mere tool of the reactionaries to hold Sweden back from advancing to socialism. The SAP was mostly indifferent to this standpoint and its outright republican wing was small, but eventually the desire to rule with fellow socialists won out.\nSince the instruments of government, which serves as the Swedish constitution, can be amended by a simple majority in the Riksdag, now commanded by the SAP-SSV coalition, this was easily enacted, despite unanimous opposition and the harsh condemnation by the Gösta Bagge and his General Electoral League, now an opposition party."

When the door opened, a coarse military voice spoke up: 'Per Albin Hansson, by orders of the new government you are under arrest for treason!'\n\nAll over the city of Stockholm, brigades of soldiers have occupied strategic spots and government buildings: from the many bridges of the city, to the Riksdaghuset, the Swedish parliament, uniformed Swedish soldiers are present. Just after dawn, army general Oscar Nygren read a statement on the national radio, declaring the 'treasonous crypto-syndicalist government with the intent of destroying Sweden's legacy forever' of Hansson neutralized and that a temporary junta directed by an organisation called the 'Arméns Fosterlandsvänner' will soon restore the old order 'from before the fraudulous elections of this year'. He cited several misdeeds that prompted the military to intervene like this, but it becomes increasingly clear that it was the sudden abolishment of the monarchy that convinced the last conservative military leaders that Hansson does not only seek to put them out of a job by reducing spending on the military, but that he also seeks to make Sweden a puppet of Paris."

Malmö, the breeding nest of the loyalist resistance and home of the revolutionary radio message, had surrendered to government forces by dawn the next morning.\nIn Stockholm, Oscar Nygren as head of the junta officially appointed his cabinet among those backing his coup.

swe.15.d:0 "The rest of the day was a blur characterized by scant information; more and more militias rose, and more and more soldiers defected to the worker's cause, leaving their rogue companies outgunned. This naturally culminated in a frenzied charge on the riksdaghuset in the late afternoon, which was occupied by the most loyal putschists, and by the end of the day, the militias controlled all major cities in Sweden.\nAs the dust began to settle, two things became clear: first, the social democratic government had completely incinerated during the coup. This became especially clear when a totalist-aligned militia found the corpse of Per Albin Hansson, murdered by the military, they clarified. He was immediately declared a martyr of the Swedish revolution. Secondly, a syndicalist republic based on the models of Britain and France has been born. While it was true that many militiamen had been liberals and social democrats, the death of Hansson convinced many of them that a firmer hand was needed, and those dissenting that policy fell prey to the first totalist tactics in hunting counterrevolutionaries, with the silent acceptance of the other socialists."
swe.15.a:0 "A new Sweden has been born today!"

swe.16.t:0 "Totalist Reign of Terror"
swe.16.d:0 "The dust had been settling after the failed attempt of the forces of reaction to chain the people in the fields in the following week. Still, the early days of the socialist republic were tumultuous and bloody. The totalist paramilitary organisations that had been making moderates disappear in the late stages of the violence, shifted their scope from crypto-reactionaries, skilfully posing as loyal comrades to subvert the worker's momentum, to the open reactionaries that had been ruling Sweden for decades, years, centuries and that had never been pretending otherwise than to control the working class. In the other factions, voices started to arise to put a stop to these practices, often executed with vicious tactics, although it was clear that in the anarchist atmosphere following the establishment of the worker's state, not everyone could be saved."
swe.16.a:0 "Let them have their fun, it can only safeguard the revolution!"
swe.16.b:0 "Restrain them for as much as we can, we are not barbarians!"

swe.17.t:0 "Swedish Refugees"
swe.17.d:0 "Sweden has fallen prey to the socialist scourge that has been plaguing Europe for a while. Following the successful establishment of a worker's state, local totalists have taken their chance to take their revenge on Swedish capitalists, politicians, priests and other men of the old Swedish regime. As a result, many try to flee Sweden and unlike many of the other nations falling prey to this scourge, they don't have a colonial empire to rely on. As such they are seeking refuge in [Root.GetNameDef]. Several groups have already arrived at our border, but should we accept them?"
swe.17.a:0 "Welcome in [Root.GetNameDef]!"
swe.17.b:0 "Turn away, Swedish scum!"

swe.18.t:0 "Militant Socialists"
swe.18.d:0 "You are travelling by motorcarriage in the countryside of Stockholm when it comes to a sudden halt. The road has been blocked by a fallen tree, and the driver explains that you will have to make a slight detour on an isolated dirt road."
swe.18.a:0 "Very well, but this had better not delay us!"

swe.19.t:0 "Militant Socialists"
swe.19.d:0 "After less than half a league on the small path, your motorcarriage gets stuck in the mud and you are ambushed and surrounded by militant socialists! They send your driver on his way, explaining that their interest lies with you alone. You try to call for your guards, but they merely laugh at this - it is they too who want your blood."
swe.19.a:0 "Y-you're not socialists!"

swe.20.t:0 "Douglas Declares Himself Riksledare"
swe.20.d:0 "Following the unfortunate discovery of the death of our dear leader Oscar Nygren at the hands of militant socialists, Archibald Douglas has taken over his status as head of the junta. Douglas immediately merged the post with his post of prime minister he already held under the name of 'Riksledare' and declared over national radio that 'considering the apparent strength of the socialist menace, the restoration of the old government would henceforth be suspended for an undefined time and that the military regime would stay in control for the foreseeable future."
swe.20.a:0 "The socialists are vicious, but our Riksledare is strong!"

swe.21.t:0 "Military Tribunals"
swe.21.d:0 "After order was swiftly restored, the first military tribunals were formed. While a large part of the judges in the normal judicial system had been appointed by conservative ministers of justice, the junta was wary that those given a permanent mandate by the social democratic ministers of justice in the early 1920s would deliver their fair share of embarrassing acquittals to traitors, some of whom were affiliated with said party.\nTo prevent this from happening, this new instance will convict everyone the military needs out of the way regarding the coup, from socialists who had been resisting the coup in the streets to those that were part of the Hansson government."
swe.21.a:0 "First trial..."

swe.22.t:0 "Hansson v. Sweden"
swe.22.d:0 "The first man to be brought before the tribunals was now-former prime minister Per Albin Hansson. This traitor had been seeking to subvert Sweden and misused the trust of the people to take their freedom away by establishing a syndicalist tyranny. Luckily his wicked plans have been disrupted by the brave and selfless actions of the military. Unluckily for Hansson, the prosecutor is part of Douglas's faction and not forgiving: he demands the death penalty for this syndicalist, but according to Swedish law the death penalty may only be imposed in times of war. As such, the main argument between prosecution and Hansson's defence is whether the coup could identify as times of war, which would decide whether Hansson could be executed or would merely be imprisoned for life for his crimes. After that, the tribunal brings in the verdict which likely sets the tone for the other trials to come..."
swe.22.a:0 "...that Hansson be imprisoned for life."
swe.22.b:0 "...that Hansson be executed."

swe.23.t:0 "Restoration of the Monarchy?"
swe.23.d:0 "The original intentions of the military men who seized control of the apparatus of state was to restore the government as it was before that faithful day of 20 September 1936, with perhaps a few extra safeguards to make sure that these tragic syndicalist infiltrations would never happen again. As such, it would be necessary to prevent the social democrats from partaking in future elections and the king, who has been painfully passive in the whole crisis, will not be brought back. Instead we shall put the grandson of the king on the throne, the duke of Västerbotten, who is known to harbour strong anti-syndicalist opinions, is an officer and who will therefore keep the nation safe.\nHowever, some in the military government instead consider that bringing back the monarchy and civilian government will only endanger their interests, and they would rather announce an extension of the military control of the country."
swe.23.a:0 "Announce the imminent restoration of 'democracy'."
swe.23.b:0 "Extend the suspension of the instruments of state!"

swe.24.t:0 "Gustaf VI Adolf Swears the Royal Oath"
swe.24.d:0 "As per the junta's promise, the monarchy has been restored today. In a grand ceremony, prince Gustaf Adolf, grandson of former king Gustaf V, has sworn the royal oath and has officially become Sweden's king as is his birthright, shortly after the law in restoring the monarchy entered into power after being affirmed by the Riksdag."
swe.24.a:0 "Long live the king!"

swe.25.t:0 "The king Appoints the New Government"
swe.25.d:0 "After the Swedish crown landed solidly on the new king's head, the transition from junta back to democracy swiftly continued. Shortly after his oath, the junta announced their resignation and a civilian government was to be established once more: with the SAP forced underground and their seats vacant, the General Electoral League enjoyed a comfortable majority among the remaining seats in the Riksdag, and thus the king asked Gösta Bagge to form a government once more. One of the last acts of the junta was entrenching the royal reserve powers that got shafted after the crisis, but it remains to be seen whether the new king will actually use them."
swe.25.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.26.t:0 "The Establishment of the Ehrensvärd Cabinet"
swe.26.d:0 "The reality was that Oscar Nygren was just a mediocre authoritative figure. Slowly, control of the factionalized junta was slipping away and taking advantage of this, general Carl August Ehrensvärd was there to help in governing the country. More and more responsibilities of Nygren were shifted to Ehrensvärd and his supporters, to the point where Nygren was little more than a puppet of the clique of Ehrensvärd. His retirement in favour of Ehrensvärd was a matter of time by then. Being much more talented for rulership, Ehrensvärd immediately shuffled the cabinet to be filled with loyalists, and thus the moderate arm of the AFV would be in control for the foreseeable future."
swe.26.a:0 "A natural process"

swe.27.t:0 "The Jung Junta"
swe.27.d:0 "Oscar Nygren isn't the most authoritative figure and scheming in his factionalized junta was the order of the day. As a result, Nygren's control was slipping away and general Helge Jung, who was present when the plans for the coup formed and the one to nominate Nygren as a weak candidate all three factions could rally behind. Needless to say, as Nygren, in part because of the tiresome scheming in his government, let it be known he intended to resign from his post, it was Jung who had gathered the support needed to take over in his wake, and quickly filled the brief power vacuum caused by it. Soon, those opposing Jung found themselves replaced by the fresh ruler and the ruling junta became synanimous with the so-called 'Jung junta'."
swe.27.a:0 "Helge Jung is the true saviour we deserve!" 

swe.28.t:0 "The Formation of the Douglas Regime"
swe.28.d:0 "Oscar Nygren was perhaps not that skilled in ruling, and he realised himself this. Few would fail to notice the slow expansion of the Douglas clique within the junta, but Nygren indeed did not. Or at the very least, he must have underestimated the threat they posed, because it still came as a surprise when pro-Douglas soldiers entered his office, pressed a proposal for a law into his hands with the message to pass it: the junta would be finished, and the Riksdag would be extended with the seats which had been left vacant after the coup by the SSV and SAP. All these seats would be transferred to a new party called the 'Svea Rike Nationella Samlingsparti', led by Douglas. Once the formalities were over, the Riksdag affirmed with a law to amend the instruments of government the office of Riksledare which would be capable of overruling the Riksdag by decree and granted the office to Archibald Douglas, giving him unlimited power within Sweden."
swe.28.a:0 "A civil government is back... But it is... Different..."

swe.29.t:0 "The Dissolution of the Landsorganisationen"
swe.29.d:0 "It was no secret that the trade unions of Sweden, unified in the so-called Landsorganisationen, as well as those unified in the Central Worker's Organisation of Sweden (SAC), supported the old treacherous government. In the aftermath of the coup, many of these trade unions tried to organise strikes against the new government, with limited success. After some time, the junta did what was necessary and dissolved all trade unions."
swe.29.a:0 "Good riddance"

swe.30.t:0 "The Reestablishment of Trade Unions"
swe.30.d:0 "The ideologues of the SRNS considered it vital to reestablish worker's interest organisations for the nation to regain the working class' support. Several factions have arrived at the office of the Riksledare: the first one supports the establishment of a Guild System that is unique to Sweden. This would make all labourers members of guilds that will be established for their craft that can be freely joined if one switches carreers or starts at the labour market. Companies will be banned from contracting people who are not part of a guild and the guild will represent its members in labour negotiations.\nThe second proposal is to allow the trade unions to organise again, albeit under strict government control.\nLastly, some argue that trade unions in whatever form or terminology are harmful to Swedish society and should remain banned as it is."
swe.30.a:0 "The Guild system faction prevails"
swe.30.b:0 "Trade Unions are reestablished under strict government control"
swe.30.c:0 "Trade Unions remain banned"

swe.31.t:0 "The Guild System"
swe.31.d:0 "A year into the new 'Guild' system, we can conclude that it is rather successful. Even though critical eyes conclude that is just yet another way of the SRNS to control society, after all the implementation of 'Gilleledares' - Guild Leaders loyal to the regime - means that it allows the regime to exclude dissidents from society by excluding them from their craftmanship and even the labour market as a whole, the reality that suddenly all Swedish worker's are represented in labour negotiations has made barbarous practices like Statare untenable and the regime, previously considered one belonging to the rich, much more popular among the lower classes of Sweden."
swe.31.a:0 "Rich and poor Swedes stand together in the quest for the greater!"

swe.32.t:0 "The State of the Trade Unions"
swe.32.d:0 "Half a year after trade unions were, under significant government surveillance, allowed to function again, the results have sadly been disappointing. Instead of taking their new allegiance seriously, we immediately saw a revival of syndicalism in its ranks and the government was soon forced to act. Troublemakers were soon evicted from the trade unions and government control took the momentum once again, but as a result few workers consider the trade unions as they are a legitimate body defending their interests. To many, they are just organisations under the thumb of the bourgeoise government and the very bosses they are supposed to oppose."
swe.32.a:0 "Cut our losses, ban them again."
swe.32.b:0 "Make membership mandatory to force participation!"

swe.33.t:0 "The Trade Unions"
swe.33.d:0 "After the government decreed that everyone partake in the unions, they were suddenly packed with uninterested workers who reluctantly attended the union meetings. The legitimacy remained low, but with a lot of government pushing participation started to rise and after some time, some concessions convinced some more workers that there was merit in this system. As a result the controlled union system has become somewhat of a self-sustaining organism but it is probably still not what the Riksledare and the ideologues intended it to be."
swe.33.a:0 "Tell the press it's a great success!"

swe.34.t:0 "A Riksledare and an Archbishop"
swe.34.d:0 "The SRNS recognized the moral authority held over the Swedish people by the church of Sweden. In fact, gaining the support of this body was one reason the small Swedish Jewish community had seen protection by the Riksledare from the less racially inclusive elements in his cabinet, as the archbishop was known to oppose antisemitism. Because of these reasons, it was no surprise that Archibald Douglas and the archbishop of Uppsala, Erling Eidem met regularly. Douglas was willing to pass substantial laws favouring the church of Sweden, for instance to restore the legislation that rendered it illegal to leave the church as well as cracking down on sinful activities. In return however, the church would have to actively remove progressive anti-government clergy and openly support the Riksledare. Based on his conversation with the Riksledare, Erling called a synod to discuss the issue."
swe.34.a:0 "Let the synod run its course..."
swe.34.b:0 "Help the decision-making by visiting anti-government clergy."

swe.35.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.35.d:0 "The synod of the church of Sweden has concluded and the priests have agreed that no earthly government the likes of that of the SRNS can have unequivocal support, and that in this light the democracy that existed before suffered from a lesser moral deficit. In addition, they agreed one can't bargain for God's support with legislation in support of His values. People need to open their hearts for it themselves after all. The clear outcome of the synod is a rejection of the SRNS doctrine.\nThe Riksledare ignited in outrage by the news and by the end of the day the Church of Sweden was no longer the state church, nor could many priests of the organisation, including Archbishop Erling, enjoy their freedom anymore."
swe.35.a:0 "B-but wrath is a sin?"

swe.36.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.36.d:0 "Strangely, many progressive clergymen did not arrive at the synod or suddenly changed their minds on the matter. However, the synod went ahead as planned: The clergymen that were actually present agreed that the execution of God's will was worth some concessions and that SRNS government was already carrying out God's will by persecuting heathenly syndicalists and protecting Sweden from this scourge.\nThe Riksledare was delighted by the news and from that point on the church of Sweden became a integral if at times somewhat reluctant part of the SRNS propaganda machine, with a topdown enforcement of orthodox government support and heavy government support for the church in return."
swe.36.a:0 "We shall hold our end of the bargain too!"

swe.37.t:0 "Transition to a Civil Government"
swe.37.d:0 "As time passed on, the military form of government became increasingly tenuous to maintain. It was therefore no surprise that at some point, the Riksledare declared all seats in the Riksdag to be part of his own party the 'Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti'. Once this was done, power was transferred to the Riksdag, which immediately moved to permanently affirm Douglas's status as Riksledare in a law that allowed the holder of said office to bypass the Riksdag itself in the Swedish instruments of government. At this point, the Riksledare possessed almost unlimited power and Sweden as it was known before the coup would be forever gone."
swe.37.a:0 "It's different but still the same."

swe.38.t:0 "The New Instruments of Government"
swe.38.d:0 "The Riksdag has passed a new set of instruments of government which serves as the Swedish constitution. The new document explicitly excludes parties subscribing to marxist or syndicalist thought, and entrenches the right of the Swedish monarch to exercise its reserve powers, as well as other minor amendments that heavily favour the conservative government."
swe.38.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.39.t:0 "Sweden Wants to Join the Internationale"
swe.39.d:0 "The Swedish revolutionary government has petitioned us with their desire to join the struggle for the world revolution. Shall we crush the bourgeoisie together with the Swedish worker?"

swe.42.t:0 "A Statue for a True Revolutionary"
swe.42.d:0 "While Per Albin Hansson was not without his faults - he was very strongly in favour of the rather hopeless strategy of working within the bourgeoise government to amend it - the man has shown himself to be a true hero of the revolution. After all, it was clear that he was most definitely intending to bring about the establishment of this republic as evidenced by the abdication of the king he pushed. Sadly, this great hero of the revolution perished at the hands of the military at the opening stages of a coup. If it wasn't for the heroic actions of a SP militia, we may never have been able to find back his body.\nOf course, such a glorious revolutionary needs to be remembered, and for that reason we have commissioned a large statue in the city where Hansson grew up: Malmö."
swe.42.a:0 "A great statue for a great revolutionary!"

swe.43.t:0 "First Day of the Revolution"
swe.43.d:0 "Exactly one year ago, the vicious capitalist tyranny was washed away with the blood of the proletariat. Since it is important for Sweden's people to remember that Sweden's freedom does not come free, we have decided to declare the day of the revolution a national holiday. On this day, all workers will have a day off and the state will organise activities for the next generation while the adults have a chance to socialise!"
swe.43.a:0 "This will become a yearly event!"

swe.44.t:0 "Day of the Revolution"
swe.44.d:0 "Once more, it is the birthday of the revolution. The state has commissioned activities for the children of Sweden in honour of the revolution while the adults, who are let off work, use their free day with the children gone to socialise!"

swe.49.t:0 "The General Electoral League Changes Its Name"
swe.49.d.socdem:0 "Since their defeat in 1936, the fate of the conservative General Electoral League has been one of misfortune. The party has been seeing much of its support defecting to the Social Democrats of Hansson, and those who supported the League in opposition to the Social Democrats are going back to the Folkpartiet if the polls are to be believed.\nIn an attempt to rebrand the party that is now the bastion of right-wing opposition and to reverse its fortunes once more, party leadership has elected to change the partyname into the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation). Whether this tactic will be successful in attracting more voters once again, remains to be seen."
swe.49.d.soccon:0 "Since our striking victory against the social democrats in 1936, the slow societal turn towards conservatism has benefited our popularity greatly. With support for Hansson and his lot shrinking each day, a decision has been made to espouse ourselves as the conservative juggernaut in Sweden. A name change, while seen initially by members of the AV as pointless, the idea of the proposal allows us to further draw in support and voters by decorating ourselves with a new face. With a majority of the party already in favour, it seems the new name for ourselves is now the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation). We can only wait and see for the public's reaction!"
swe.49.d.marlib:0 "While not necessarily a defeat, their second place in the coalition has warranted the conservatives a steep decline in voters and public support. With the majority now aligning with us, the Folkpartiet, and any wayward centrists turning towards the Farmer’s league or Hanssons social democrats. \n\nIn an attempt to rebrand the party that is now the bastion of right-wing opposition and to reverse its fortunes once more, party leadership has elected to change the partyname into the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation).

swe.53.t:0 "Folkpartiet Rises in the Polls"
swe.53.d:0 "For a while, it seemed like disenfranchising the social democrats had made conservative control over Sweden unopposed. It seems however, that in their absence, the liberal Folkpartiet has risen to prominence, with much of the old social democratic support base now putting their weight behind them, knowing that while they do not espouse the same economic ideals as them, they do support bringing the SAP back into the legality and restoring freedom like it used to be before the conservatives made their control virtually impenetrable using the law."
swe.53.a:0 "A new challenger arises..."

swe.54.t:0 "The Folkpartiet Controls the Opposition"
swe.54.d:0 "For an extended amount of time, the conservatives have been the most influential party in Sweden, but this seems to be over. First they lost the government to the social democrats, and as they continued to fail to decisively recapture it, their performance at the polls has been declining. Last elections it has finally happened: with the conservatives once again winning the least amount of seats since the establishment of the modern Riksdag, they have lost their standing as the second-largest party and dropped to the third place in favour of the liberals, who will now take over the leadership over the Swedish opposition."

Now, with no clear majority in the Riksdag, the party faces a critical decision, whether to form a coalition with the market-liberal Folkpartiet, whose economic vision aligns with rural entrepreneurialism, or with the Social Democrats, whose focus on welfare and social cohesion appeals to many within Bondeförbundet's cooperative tradition. Both options offer stability, but also carry risks of alienating key parts of the base. The path chosen will define Sweden’s political direction for years to come."

swe.70.d:0 "As a result of our policy of devaluing the Swedish Krona, it has become quite cheap to buy the raw resources we export. As a result, our exports skyrocketed and this is having a positive effect on our domestic employment!"
swe.70.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.71.t:0 "Hyperinflation"
swe.71.d:0 "Our decision to keep devaluing the Swedish Krona after it started to have an effect on our economy may have been a mistake. The inflation now started snowballing and everything is showing that the domestic price level will double twice this year. As everyone's monetary possessions are melting away before the sun, we have basically no choice but to abandon our sovereign currency and start again with a new one."
swe.71.a:0 "The Krona is dead! Long live the Krona!"

swe.73.t:0 "The Death of King Gustaf"
swe.73.d:0 "Our dearest sovereign, king Gustaf V of Sweden, has died today in the Stockholm palace as a result of flu complications. A century ago, the crown prince, Gustaf VI Adolf, would be crowned king of Sweden; like his father however, his majesty has opted not to be crowned and instead to take only the Konungaförsäkran - the regal assurance."
swe.73.a:0 "The king is dead, long live the king!"

swe.74.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf V"
swe.74.d:0 "The former royal sovereign of Sweden, Gustaf Bernadotte, has passed away in the estate Bernadotte bought some 40 kilometers outside Stockholm after the loss of the Swedish throne. Still hoping for a restoration, his son Gustaf Adolf Bernadotte has taken over as the pretender to the Swedish throne."
swe.74.a:0 "Rest in peace..."

swe.75.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf V"
swe.75.d:0 "The former royal sovereign of Sweden, Gustaf Bernadotte, has passed away in the estate the Bernadotte family bought some 40 kilometers outside Stockholm after the loss of the Swedish throne. His Majesty king Gustaf VI Adolf, who had been restored to the throne after his grandfather lost it, has personally assured that he will be buried along with the other former kings of Sweden since Gustavus Adolphus in the Riddarholmskyrkan."
swe.75.a:0 "Rest in peace..."

swe.76.t:0 "The Propagandaspeakers"
swe.76.d:0 "The communal government of the capital - probably with encouragement of certain elements in our cabinet - has approved a motion to install loudspeakers with music and state propaganda in all public buildings encouraging the workers to do their part for the Swedish Revolution as well as advocating ideological purity. Many think this would be a great testing environment to see the effectiveness of such a doctrine of total propaganda, but some fear that the effects will be limited and that the enthousiastic approach of the communal government will only be counterproductive."
swe.76.a:0 "Who would we be to meddle with the local government?"
swe.76.b:0 "Tell them to cancel it, this won't work!"

swe.77.t:0 "Mediocre Effect of the Propagandaspeakers"
swe.77.d:0 "The extensive use of propagandaspeakers we let the communal government implement has had a mediocre effect it seems: while indeed the membership of totalist unions has increased marginally more than in the rest of the country, there have been several complaints that the loud noise of the loudspeakers keeps them out of their concentration (at work) or sleep (at night). Several loudspeakers have even been damaged and required replacement. It seems the experiment is moderately unsuccessful."
swe.77.a:0 "Extend the usage to all of Sweden!"
swe.77.b:0 "Have the experiment be abandoned!"

swe.78.t:0 "The Fate of the Press"
swe.78.d:0 "Following the establishment of the worker's state, an imminent problem was the press: most newspapers and as well as the national radio service remained active in the aftermath of the Swedish revolution and some of them even had the gall to criticise the new order.\n\nWhile all factions among the revolutionaries agreed that blatant bourgeoise propagandastations like the capitalist Svenska Dagbladet can obviously not remain active as it is, they all proposed a different approach. The Flyggists of the SP proposed their plan of 'Likriktning': all media in Sweden ought to be put under strict government surveillance to ensure the revolution remains well-protected from reactionary lies. The syndicalists of the SAC had a different proposition: all media should be reorganized in a single newswriters union under the general Swedish Landsorganisationen, which will ensure the content will be objective and not spread falsehoods to the detriment of the socialist order. Finally, the radical socialists of the SSV propose cautiousness; while they agree that obviously reactionary newsmedia should be dissolved, they want us to leave the rest of the media alone."
swe.78.a:0 "Likriktning: protect the revolution!"
swe.78.b:0 "Reorganisation: seize the means of information!"
swe.78.c:0 "Cautiousness: save the freedom of press!"

swe.79.t:0 "The Establishment of the Stasä"
swe.79.d:0 "Many non-totalist socialists were rather dissatisfied with the actions of the SP's paramilitary organisations against reactionaries. By their accounts, the hunt has cost the lives of many who could not even be considered a threat to the revolutionary order, and made it a lot harder to convince Swedes that did not yet subscribe to the revolution that this was really the best way forward.\n\nAs a result of this, they proposed to establish a new agency that would receive the sole authority to protect Sweden from counterrevolutionary activity and with official government support. Somewhat to their surprise, the totalists jumped right on this idea and propose far-reaching powers for this new 'Sekretariatet för Statssäkerhet' - it seems like they are hoping to gain control over it."
swe.79.a:0 "Let the hunt restart with new resources!"
swe.79.b:0 "Institute proper checks and balances."

swe.80.t:0 "Socialisation of the Economy in Practice"
swe.80.d:0 "With the decree from congress clear, the wealth that we took from domestic and foreign capitalist pigs around the Swedish nation is ready to be returned to the Swedish people with interest. Henceforth, the average Swede shall enjoy the prosperity it deserves without being a serf to plutocratic interests!"
swe.80.a:0 "Establish a strong union-based economy!"
swe.80.b:0 "Establish a single union to represent the working class!"
swe.80.c:0 "Establish a autonomous commune-based economy!"

swe.81.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf Bernadotte"
swe.81.d:0 "The nefarious symbol of reaction, Gustaf Bernadotte, who acted as the figurehead for his German reactionary-capitalist puppetmasters' exploitation of Sweden for almost 30 years, has died in exile, while still hoping to some day mend the chains that once shackled the people of Sweden. His son has taken over the mantle as pretender for the 'Swedish throne' and as figurehead for the Swedish exiles."
swe.81.a:0 "Good riddance!"

swe.82.t:0 "The Centralisation of Power"
swe.82.d:0 "After having been installed into power by the worker's mandate, the Totalisterna and now their general secretary immediately went to work. Some of the first actions of Nils Flyg as the general secretary was to relieve those senior officials that were hostile to the totalist thought and the doctrine of total commitments to the revolution from their duty and replacing them with loyal members of the movement."
swe.82.a:0 "You don't belong there if you aren't totally committed!"

swe.83.t:0 "Pacifying the Unions"
swe.83.d:0 "It didn't take long until the apparatus of state had been cleansed of anti-totalism. With the different positions around the government under totalist control, the main political threat to continued unity of Sweden were the unions, that could technically enforce a congress to force a change of government. To prevent crypto-reactionary revisionism from taking root again, the General Secretary announced that union leaders were to be subjected to political tests lest they lead their herd to the wrong end of the spectrum."
swe.83.a:0 "Swedes may not be deceived by revisionists!"

swe.84.t:0 "The Start of Something Greater!"
swe.84.d:0 "After a few months, the hold of the totalist movement over Swedish society had become near total.\nGeneral Secretary Nils Flyg often held speeches to rouse the Swedish people in favour of the national-revolutionary doctrine with his perfected talents for speeching. One day, after such a speech, the 'Folkets Dagblad' which the Swedish leader once redacted started with a front article lauding the great leadership of the General Secretary so far and his wisdom.\n\nThe Article has caught the attention of the leader and his cabinet, who start to consider that letting the media focus on the qualities of Nils Flyg could be politically beneficial."
swe.84.a:0 "Start to work on this 'Cult of Personality'!"
swe.84.b:0 "Our focus should be the revolution, not comrade Flyg!"

swe.85.t:0 "The Creation of a Cult"
swe.85.d:0 "During the last year, news has exacerbated the role of Nils Flyg in the revolution. Comrade Flyg's role in the revolution has become legendary, and it is widely portrayed that it was his decision to defend the revolution from liberals that made it possible to happen. In addition, schools have been instructed to portray Nils Flyg as a true Swedish hero and an example for all to follow and official photographs of the General Secretary adorn the carriages of public transport!"
swe.85.a:0 "Excellent, Comrade Flyg is an example to us all!"

swe.86.t:0 "The Writer's Union Wants to Write a Biography"
swe.86.d:0 "The Writer's Union has let us know that they intend to write a biography about our great leader Nils Flyg, from childhood to today. This is of course a great way to further the popular knowledge about their general secretary, but some discord started to boil over whether we - and comrade Nils in particular - should hold a tight leash on what is being written. Some in the cabinet want us to subject this endeavour under close government control, while others believe that in the knowledge that the Writer's Union is known to be politically correct means it wouldn't become a character assassination, and that if it would turn out in such a way we can always censor it before it is released."
swe.86.a:0 "We need to make sure the truth is written down!"
swe.86.b:0 "Let the writer's write as they would."

swe.87.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.87.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, like how the general secretary already made remarks about the inherent unfairness of the contemporary feudal-capitalist system that held Sweden in chains at the tender age of 8 years old and how bourgeoise spies that infiltrated the workers movement constantly tried to hinder Flyg's career, recognizing that he would liberate the Swedish worker if they couldn't control him, which eventually of course, they couldn't. The book ends in describing the instrumental role Flyg played in the Swedish revolution, which could be considered a departure from the government stance that had been held since the revolution, where the ultimate sacrifice of Per Albin Hansson was accredited as the main event that sowed the seeds for a revolutionary regime."
swe.87.a:0 "An excellent literary artwork!"
swe.87.b:0 "Lies upon lies, cancel the biography!"

swe.88.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.88.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, telling the story from his birth to his rise to power in the present day. In general the book is positive about Flyg's endeavours, praising for instance his capacity to self-educate in his early youth allowing him to rise among the many workers in the socialist movement at the beginning of the 20th century, but also strikes a critical tone at times: for instance the implication is made that the strength of the socialist movement was hurt a lot by Flyg's decision to move forward with his own party, which contributed to the fracturing of Swedish socialism. Indeed the book also puts some weight in criticising the absence of Flyg during the most uncertain hours of the revolution while totalist paramilitaries roamed the streets."
swe.88.a:0 "Criticism is healthy, go ahead!"
swe.88.b:0 "Oh no, I think not!"

swe.89.t:0 "The General Secretary Visits a Workplace"
swe.89.d:0 "In order to bring the touch of the regime closer to the people, the General Secretary, a former industrial worker himself, has arrived to visit a factory where Sweden's industrial heart beats the strongest. One of the civil servants of the secretariat of economics has in the meanwhile drafted a plan to increase the efficiency of factories such as these. One of the junior members of the General Secretary's entourage proposes disposing of the civil servant and bringing the idea as comrade Flyg's own in the ending speech he will give, which would show the wisdom of comrade Flyg to the Swedish people."
swe.89.a:0 "A cunning plan! Make the arrangements."
swe.89.b:0 "Laud the Civil Servant for his achievement!"

swe.90.t:0 "Nils Flyg has a Heart Attack"
swe.90.d:0 "Tragedy: our General Secretary, Nils Flyg, has been hit by a heart attack today. Fortunately, he survived the calamity, but after being rushed to the doctor the doctor explains that Flyg will never be the same again. He will likely suffer from short breath henceforth which will likely become progressively worse in the future. And there is a risk that he will suffer a second heart attack. The doctor recommends that comrade Flyg takes as much rest as possible."
swe.90.a:0 "Rest? The General Secretary of Sweden never rests!"

swe.91.t:0 "The General Secretary's Ill Health Starts to Become Public!"
swe.91.d:0 "Since comrade Flyg's heart attack, his short-breathedness has progressively become worse as the doctor predicted. As a result, the General Secretary eventually caved and dialed down his public appearances, which in turn is feeding the rumour among the Swedish populace that something is wrong with their General Secretary - with the news about the heart attack carefully being censored.\n\nBecause of our... zealous investment in the cult of personality of Nils Flyg, words are spreading that this is the proof that the government is deceiving the Swedish populace, trying to portray Flyg as a God when he is really just a man that can also fall ill."
swe.91.a:0 "Hold a Rally to prove that Flyg is just fine!"
swe.91.b:0 "Time to switch to damage control!"

swe.92.t:0 "The Rally Is Unsuccessful"
swe.92.d:0 "The rally we organised to prove the health of our eternal general secretary has not been able to end the doubts; in fact, the situation has worsened as a result because while the speech started relatively smooth, it was easy to observe that the General Secretary was not well from the very beginning and as the speech continued a clear fatigue overcame the General Secretary. It made one journalist even feel bold enough to want to write that Nils Flyg's life has been shortened by three months by this event. Naturally, this counterrevolutionary scum has swiftly been taken care of."
swe.92.a:0 "I tell you, he is in good health!"

swe.93.t:0 "A Hotel Room has been Requisitioned"
swe.93.d:0 "As the condition of our General Secretary slowly deteriorates, he has become unable to make the daily travel from villa Tomtebo, the home of Flyg he acquired in 1924. As it is important for his duties as General Secretary that he is able to convene with congress and other officials of the Swedish state, he has requisitioned a hotel room close to the Stockholm castle, where the assembly convenes and he has his office. Reportedly he is distressed by the fact that he will for the time being live in a hotel room."
swe.93.a:0 "It's for the good of the country..."

swe.94.t:0 "The Motion Linderot"
swe.94.d:0 "Since the totalist seizure of power, the Swedish congress had become a mere rubberstamping institution for General Secretary Flyg, with little in the way of upsets. The congress was filled with committed totalists, except for about ~30% of the delegates, who were not removed to retain the pretense of democracy and had rallied around Nils Flyg's former associate Karl Kilbom and basically unsuccessfully vote against almost every proposal, with every proposal getting the exact same amount of seats in favour and against since the consolidation of SP control.\n\nThis morning, this atmosphere of political apathy was suddenly crushed: Sven Linderot, the leader of a faction within the SP in favour of greater internationalism and a lesser (European) nationalist doctrine with the party, suddenly pitched a motion to establish a 'Politiska Byrån' - political bureau - to take over the General Secretary's duties on behalf of congress as long as his condition will not allow him to properly exercise said duties. This was swiftly condemned by Flyg loyalists, headed by Arvid Olsson, yet the Kilbommare, witnessing this split in their nemesis, capitalised and supported the motion. For the first time since 1937, a motion against the will of the Flyggists passed."
swe.94.a:0 "How dare they!"

swe.95.t:0 "The Appointment of the 'Politiska Byrån'"
swe.95.d:0 "Following the passing of the Linderot Motion through congress, congress had to elect the delegates that would become members of the bureau. Unsurprisingly, Linderot had pitched his own list with himself as the chairman of the bureau and loyalists for the rest, which would essentially give him all power Flyg previously possessed. The Kilbommare did not cave to that however, and moved to present their own alternative list of syndicalist democracy proponents headed by Kilbom himself. Olsson and the Flyggists were wary of being left the opposition incapable of stopping the motion again, and resolved it would be better to help one of the two sides to the majority they require to take the bureau - hopefully the side that would be the least capable of removing Flyg from power."
swe.95.a:0 "Support Linderot - at least he is Totalist!"
swe.95.b:0 "Support Kilbom - at least he didn't betray us!"

swe.96.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Orders Flyg Be Moved Home!"
swe.96.d:0 "With his hold over the Political Bureau of his own creation, Sven Linderot was given de-facto in control over the country. The first act of the bureau is to have Flyg be moved back to Tomtebo. According to the bureau, this is so the General Secretary can rest, but most consider the real underlying reason is to render Flyg politically pacified. After all, without his hotelroom Flyg can't easily get to the halls of power in a good condition and thus it will be significantly easier for Linderot and his companions to control the country and Flyg's omnipresent supporters. Unsurprisingly, the General Secretary resisted with all the power he had, but the police officers 'to protect him' were relentless."
swe.96.a:0 "It is for your own good, Nisse!"

swe.97.t:0 "The Political Bureau Gathers for the Next Move!"
swe.97.d:0 "With the General Secretary out of the picture, the control of the Political Bureau is unlimited. Now a choice lies before Linderot: either he could announce Flyg's resignation now while Flyg is incapable to react and in poor health, or he could hold his horses, ruling the country for the foreseeable future, taking the gamble that Flyg will not recover and possibly go after him in the future for what he just did."
swe.97.a:0 "Announce Flyg's resignation!"
swe.97.b:0 "Let us remain just where we are!"

swe.98.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.98.d:0 "With Nils Flyg 'resigned' Linderot's own ambitions have been exposed. The Flyggists and mixed totalists, now firmly aware of what Linderot is trying to do and that Flyg's resignation wasn't his own decision, pitch comrade Flyg and exclaim that they will never support 'the rat' Sven Linderot for General Secretary, saying they'll put in even Kilbom into that office before Linderot. The Kilbommare opposition meanwhile, seek to do exactly that, but also among them it is clear, that by the guise of 'better the devil you know' and the consideration that Flyg is in poor shape, they are inclined to support Flyg. Coming in as a dark horse candidate for the position of General Secratary is Sven Olov Lindholm, a hardline Charter Toalist and supporter of General Secretary Flyg; who has often come into conflict with more mainstream Syndicalists. While some decry him as a pseudo reactionary, he appears to have a significant bout of sway considering Kilbom's craven moderatism and Flyg's poor health. It seems Linderot has overplayed his hand; he has lost the race before it even began and knowing that either side won't be soft on him for his attempted powergrab, his supporters are bailing out left and right. The question is however, which side will cave to the other first?"
swe.98.a:0 "Flyg is reelected in the third round!"
swe.98.c:0 "Lindholm is elected in the third round!"
swe.98.b:0 "Kilbom is elected in the third round!"

swe.99.t:0 "The Purge of the Linderot Faction!"
swe.99.d:0 "With the removal of Flyg, the Political Bureau was automatically dissolved too as it was a kind of regency for the General Secretary. As such, Linderot and his loyalists had been planning to invoke the articles included in their motion to reestablish the political bureau. However, these plans were cut short when the authorities arrived at Linderot's doorstep and arrested him on the suspicion of reactionary sympathies. In a show trial the same day he was with hastily convicted to thirty years of hard labour and sent on his way to a prison complex in the north of Sweden specifically designated for enemies of the regime. He was not seen again in Stockholm.\n\nSeveral other staunch Linderot loyalists have been put into custody too. The power of Linderot and his internationalist totalists has been broken."
swe.99.a:0 "Good Riddance!"

swe.100.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Dissolves Congress!"
swe.100.d:0 "With Kilbom in control of the bureau that takes care of the duties of the most important office of the country, the bureau has decreed that the political barriers imposed by General Secretary Flyg earlier are to be removed and had the congress dissolve. In a month's time all delegates of the congress shall face a free election, with no political barriers holding you back from partaking. It is obvious that the Kilbommare are out on getting a congress hostile to totalist rule to commence a recall vote on General Secretary Flyg, to then restore democracy."
swe.100.a:0 "Time to start campaigning!"

swe.101.t:0 "Recall Vote on Nils Flyg"
swe.101.d:0 "After vigorous campaigning, free elections have been held and changed the composition of congress. As such, we are now pitching a recall vote to try and remove Nils Flyg from power, which will let us in turn elect a new General Secretary and safeguard revolutionary democracy in Sweden."
swe.101.a:0 "The recall vote passes, Nils Flyg is removed!"
swe.101.b:0 "The recall vote fails, Flyg remains in power."

swe.102.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.102.d:0 "The syndicalist-democratically aligned congress removed Nils Flyg from his office as General Secretary, which probably helps him more than it hurts him, considering his fragile health. Congress must now elect a new General Secretary however. Most agree that Karl Kilbom - now the saviour of Swedish revolutionary democracy - should become the new General Secretary on behalf of the SSV. The SAC did nominate Frans Severin however and members from both parties have formed an alliance in the hopes of abolishing the office of General Secretary altogether, considering that it only leads to tyranny."
swe.102.a:0 "Kilbom is elected General Secretary."
swe.102.b:0 "Severin is elected General Secretary."

His wife was rushed to his hotelroom as fast as possible but when she arrived it had already been too late - the General Secretary passed away alone. While she lost her husband, Sweden lost its leader, and chaos overtakes congress as a vacuum in power has suddenly spawned out of this as a result. This vacuum was soon filled however: with Linderot and Kilbom having been outplayed earlier and the SP faction reunited, it seems clear who shall become the new chairman of the SP."

Flyg had spent his last months grumbling and raging against Sven Linderot, who as chairman of a 'Political Bureau' had him moved home 'to rest' as a result of which he could do nothing against the chairman's de-facto exercise of power that technically belonged to him. For better or for worse though, he was at home at his Tomtebo villa; had he remained in the hotel room that he had been assigned at first, he might well have died alone, without his wife and closest supporters by his side.\n\nCongress was swift in declaring Sven Linderot the second Chairman of Sweden, who had discretely been consolidating his power while ruling in Flyg's place.

swe.128.t:0 "Rocketry Accident"
swe.128.d:0 "One of our rockets that was being tested in our bid to extend our knowledge surrounding rocketry has been in somewhat of an accident: the trajectory of the rocket, which was supposed to drop into the baltic sea to be recollected by us, had been miscalculated. As a result of this, the rocket has only crashed almost 200km north of its original planned target. Needless to say, local authorities are all over it already."
swe.128.a:0 "I fear that rocket is lost..."

swe.129.t:0 "The Bäckebo Bomb"
swe.129.d:0 "A German missile has crashed in the Swedish woods near Bäckebo, part of one Robert Gustavsson's land, where it left a detonation crater that is five meters wide. Our military has already arrived and taken possession of the wreckage, and it is being transported to Stockholm as we speak to be examined."
swe.129.a:0 "Finders, keepers!"

 swe.130.t: "Gustaf V of Sweden Abdicates the Throne"
 swe.130.d: "In a press release in front of Stockholm Palace today, His Highness King Gustaf V shocked the world by stating he has abdicated the throne of Sweden, dissolving over 115 years of rule by the House of Bernadotte. His Highness is quoted as saying "The elected representatives of the Swedish people have found it necessary to request my abdication. This is not a decision I take lightly, but I will not oppose the will of the people." The Swedish royal family has been granted permission to maintain residency in the country, but must forfeit all royal titles. Members of the royal family including Gustaf's own son and grandson have chosen to flee the country rather than give up their titles. The ruling SAP has in the kings’ stead appointed their leader, Per Albin Hansson as President of the new Swedish Republic. The future of Sweden seems uncertain."
 swe.130.a: "The northern lights dim further."

 swe.131.t: "Swedish Army Declares Martial Law"
 swe.131.d: "In the aftermath of the reformation of Sweden into a socialist republic under the SAP-SSV coalition and the abolishment of the monarchy, General Oscar Nygren and the Swedish Armed Forces under the cover of night swiftly occupied Stockholm this morning, declaring Martial Law across the city. Military Police battalions have been ordered to arrest all socialist politicians related to the Hansson cabinet, as the National Security Forces have mobilised to secure any pockets of socialist resistance. While there have been reports of some bloodshed, it seems the coup has been relatively unopposed. One of General Nygren's first decisions at the helm of the Swedish state was to reinstate the Royal families titles, as well as invite back Gustaf Adolf, grandson of Gustaf V. While Sweden might once again be stable, it remains to be seen what their future holds."
 swe.131.a: "One way or another, order returns to Sweden."

The Naval Board wishes to build new armoured ships, in addition to modern escorts and submarines. The goal is threefold. The navy must be able to protect Sweden's long coast, control the Baltic Sea and project power. Although it has only been suggested, it is clear that marine management is thinking of Åland, Finland and the Baltics.\n\nAt the same time, the Swedish air force has presented plans for drastically expanding the service. The Swedish air force has proposed drastically expanding the service. Sweden could have a large air force consisting of modern, indigenous designs.\n\nIt is clear that the Swedish economy cannot support the development of both a modern navy and a modern air force.

swe_syncon.1.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has been assembled for its first session. Tensions are high as all three parties are vying for power in this new, strange political climate. Membership numbers for all parties are exploding, although Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) is the largest one by far. \n\nFrom his podium, Karl Kilbom of the SSV advocates that in the new Sweden, we (the state) look after everyone who needs it, without prying into the affairs of common citizenry. Nils Flyg of Socialistiska partiet (SP) claims that citizenry police needs to be established, to 'safeguard the revolution' while Albert Jensen of Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation (SAC) claims that every commune should look after their own." 
swe_syncon.1.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."

swe_syncon.2.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee Assembly - Economic System"
swe_syncon.2.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has assembled for a second time. The initial belief that seizing power in Sweden would unify the left has now completely waned. Reforming the economy of Sweden is the topic of the day, and speaking sharply for the SSV is Anna Johansson Visborg, claiming that strong unions and government influence will secure worker's rights. \n\nThe SP representative, Sven Linderot, claims that all workers should be gathered into a single, large union, and a the focus should be on massive state funded projects. Finally, Gustav Sjöström of the Syndicalists proposes the idea of commune based economy, where every region should strive to be self-sufficient."

swe_syncon.3.d:0 "For a third time the Revolutionary Committee holds session. With the current military disloyal to the red cause, the various leaders are discussing radical army reforms. Zeth Höglund of the SSV wants to reintegrate the Swedish army through education of staff and soldiers, where soldiers council's should elect officers out of their own ranks. \n\nGustav Johansson from SP claims that a strong army needs a strong central command, and that a National School for politically indoctrinated officers must be the backbone of our new army. The SAC representative, Nisse Lätt, believes armies should be trained and used for local, defensive deployment and only summoned elsewhere for extreme situations."

swe_syncon.4.d:0 "Our fourth session has been assembled. Outside the doors, Sweden lies in chaos, but inside we are assured we can sort it out. Our new society must build upon equality, a strong union and compassion for your fellow man, or so claims Östen Unden of SSV. \n\nHilding Hagberg from SP believes that we must put faith in a strong man to lead us all into an era where Sweden isn't just a strong nation, it's a great nation, rivaled by none and feared by all! The most passionate of all speakers however is the SAC representative Elise Ottosen Jensen, who envisions her dream of a society free of oppression, where one cares and shares with your local community."

swe_flavor.1.d:0 "Karin Boye, a prominent author, poet and female rights activist coloured by socialism has just released her latest piece. It's a novel called För Lite (Too Little or For Little) and centres around the themes of working to achieve your dreams or make your ends meet, and your responsibility to yourself as a person and to your family and friends. Boye is very popular and her new novel is a success."
swe_flavor.1.a:0 "I shall have to read it sometime."

swe_flavor.2.t:0 "Greta Garbo Stars in Camille."
swe_flavor.2.d:0 "Greta Garbo stars in the American produced movie Camille, a romantic drama. Greta Garbo is one of the biggest names in the movie industry, both in Sweden and in the world. The movie is rather harmless and holds a high quality production but some of the more conservative elements of our society are most upset... Her clothes are a bit revealing! They are calling for a censorship. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.2.a:0 "That outfit is too revealing! Censor it!"
swe_flavor.2.b:0 "It seems most entertaining. Send me a ticket!"

swe_flavor.3.t:0 "Five Year Commemoration of Ådalen"
swe_flavor.3.d:0 "In May 1931 a large march of strikers marched towards barracks for blacklegs who were working at local factories. The police had called in the military for support and before the day was over, the riots had ended in five strikers being killed by military fire. Ever since then yearly marches are held in memory of the dead workers among socialists, although conservatives claim that the workers were armed and attacked them first. The strikes of this year are unusually large. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.3.a:0 "Let them. They'll tire eventually."
swe_flavor.3.b:0 "Wasn't once enough? Send in the military!"

swe_flavor.4.t:0 "Final Sentence of the Sala-gang"
swe_flavor.4.d:0 "In the summer of last year a gang led by a name called Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman (a name he added himself, presumably because it is an anagram for Manhunter) was arrested for a murder. Soon the investigations reached nationwide front news as it turned out that the gang was not only guilty of murders dating all the way back to 1931, but also because it was ran more or less like an occult group and went under the nickname 'The Magic circle''. \n\nThe leader and the conspirators were sentenced in court the other day, most of them to life in prison but the leader was considered so mentally ill that he was sentenced to closed psychiatric care. Many people are outraged, and would have wanted to see Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman put away for good!"
swe_flavor.4.a:0 "We must respect the court's decision. Closed care it is."
swe_flavor.4.b:0 "Arrange for this monster to be relocated to a prison."

swe_flavor.5.t:0 "Manhunter on the Loose!"
swe_flavor.5.d:0 "Two years ago, Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman was sentenced to closed psychiatric care but our politicians overruled the decisions and put him in prison. In prison his mental state reportedly worsened, and just after Christmas last year he broke out and murdered a taxi driver and stole his car. The police lacks any good leads and fear he may have gone underground or even left the country..."
swe_flavor.5.a:0 "What have I done?!"

swe_flavor.6.t:0 "Major Hotel Strike!"
swe_flavor.6.d:0 "After failed negotiations with the unions a major hotel strike has caused a hotel lockout in Sweden. From Stockholm to Göteborg to Malmö you won't find a single hotel which is properly staffed. Striking down at the protestors violently could disperse them... or set off a backlash, while negotiation with them could make the red parties grow. We could just ignore them, but that might hurt our economy, at least for a while."
swe_flavor.6.a:0 "Let's replay Ådalen, send in the military!"
swe_flavor.6.b:0 "Let's negotiate with them."
swe_flavor.6.c:0 "Ignore them. Surely it will stop?"

swe_flavor.7.t:0 "City Massacre"
swe_flavor.7.d:0 "Our brave soldiers nobly defended the government directives when the strikers, reds and other rabble started throwing bottles and rocks. The turmoil and riots lasted for the entire day and over a dozen workers have been killed before the protestors were fully cleared. For some reason a couple of journalists managed to leak pictures of bleeding civilians in the streets of Göteborg, and now Sweden is in shock!"
swe_flavor.7.a:0 "If they had only stayed home..."

swe_flavor.8.t:0 "The Hotel Strike Ends"
swe_flavor.8.d:0 "For several months the strike has been going on, hurting our economy and our prestige, but eventually we tired them out. The strikes have ended and things are back to normal... For now."

swe_flavor.9.t:0 "Funeral of Gösta Ekman"
swe_flavor.9.d:0 "The legend of Gösta Ekman, Sweden's most popular actor and theatre-director, passed away at age 47 after a period of sickness. In the last eleven years, Ekman was part of no less than twenty three productions. Following his funeral train in the streets of Stockholm, over 100 000 (!) people, roughly a fifth of the city, watched the coffin pass and mourned the end of a Swedish legend."
swe_flavor.9.a:0 "We all mourn today."

swe_flavor.10.t:0 "Astrid Kindstrand on the Radio"
swe_flavor.10.d:0 "A few days ago, Astrid Kindstrand read the news on Sweden's Radio, the national radio channel, the first woman to do so in Swedish history. In the following days, hundreds of angry phonecalls and letters reached the state and various newspapers across the country to complain that a woman is allowed to read state news."
swe_flavor.10.a:0 "Don't they have anything else to be upset about?"

swe_flavor.11.t:0 "Landstormens Lilla Lotta"
swe_flavor.11.d:0 "A new Swedish comedy movie has hit the theatres and reached a surprising amount of popularity. It plays a bit with the traditional story of Romeo and Julia but also throws things of order upside down, such as making the bank director a private when he joins the army and the groundskeeper a commander. Everyone fools around and no one takes their military training seriously while falling in love with one of the pretty women of the Lotta-corps."
swe_flavor.11.a:0 "Oh ho ho! I love me some jolly movies!"
swe_flavor.11.b:0 "How dare they mock the Swedish military like this?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.12.t:0 "Garbo Skrattar - Ninotchka!"
swe_flavor.12.d:0 "Garbo laughs - That is how the movie is marketed all across the world, as the Swedish, beautiful mega-star Greta Garbo does her first attempt at a comedy movie. The movie centres around Garbo in the role of Ninotchka, an ice-cold syndicalist who finds love and abandons her political ideas to move to a capitalist society. Even though it is tounge-in-cheek, and makes fun of the capitalist society too, it is clear that it mocks all forms of syndicalism."
swe_flavor.12.a:0 "She is so beautiful! Get me a ticket!"
swe_flavor.12.b:0 "How dare they mock the glorious Swedish revolution?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.13.t:0 "Kallocain Released"
swe_flavor.13.d:0 "Kallocain is a novel written by the ever busy Karin Boye. It takes place in a dystopian, fictive nation where critizising the state is strictly illegal and the state controls every single part of your life. It reflects on men and women, on class issues and the conflicts that arise from these issues. It is, ultimately, a depressing read. It takes brutal stabs at any totalitarian regimes, left or right."
swe_flavor.13.a:0 "A fascinating and disturbing read!"
swe_flavor.13.b:0 "How dare she mock the strong, glorious state? Censor it!"

swe_flavor.14.t:0 "Death of Karin Boye"
swe_flavor.14.d:0 "Karin Boye was found lifeless on a hill north of Alingsås after she had, seemingly intentionally, overdosed on sleeping pills. The poet and author was known for her emotional instability, in particular over the last few months. Even more so perhaps since one of the women she loved, Anita Nathorst, was dying of cancer. Her sexuality was a public secret, and the pressure of it all might have been too much."
swe_flavor.14.a:0 "Visst gör det ont när knopparna brister..."

swe_flavor.15.t:0 "IKEA Founded"
swe_flavor.15.d:0 "The other day a seventeen-year-old lad named Ingvar Kamprad founded a small company for selling everything from pencils and fishing tools, to stockings and belts. It is run from his parent's private farm as a mail order company and appearently he will personally bike out to your home and deliver the goods to your front door."

swe_flavor.16.t:0 "New Malmö Theatre Opens"

swe_flavor.17.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Passes Away"
swe_flavor.17.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many as a father of the Nation. The former admiral reigned as prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nIt is said that Bagge rarely took any decisions without asking for advice from the senior Lindman, but no longer. A public funeral will be held and attended by the King and other people of fine birth."

swe_flavor.18.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Is Dead"
swe_flavor.18.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many to be a tyrant who did everything he could to kill democracy and socialism in it's cradle. He reigned as a prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nWhen our revolutionary government proclaimed Sweden to be a republic, he was among the first to flee abroad and he died, alone and unwanted, in a flat in Berlin."

swe_flavor.19.d:0 "With war coming to the shores of Sweden, the stunt-pilot Elsa Andersson, known for her daring parachuting in the twenties, has requested to form a women's only air brigade. The project has adopted the name 'Valkyriorna', after the winged women of ancient norse mythology who oversaw which warriors would be slain on the battlefield. Women have gathered in droves to sign up, wanting the chance to fight for Sweden, but the idea is not undisputed. Many feel that women in the army is not fitting with a modern civilised nation."

Following two groups, one being the shop assistants Inga and Britta who travel on bike across Sweden, the other being Nisse and Rut enjoying their honeymoon in their truck. Directed by Arne Bornebusch, the film has drawn in many in Stockholm at its release, giving many a time for laughs and cheers as they enjoy their leisure. Showcasing the beautiful aspects of Sweden’s cities and countryside, a scene of a loving wedding to melt viewers hearts, with the film ending of a priest congratulating the newly wedded young couples, reminding those watching of the richness of Sweden, and of their love for the nation."

swe_flavor.21.t:0 "Strange Disappearances in Kiruna"
swe_flavor.21.d:0 "The arrival of Black Monday has hit Swedish society hard, but nowhere quite as badly as in the furthest north. With the collapse of the global economy, the mines and related industries that kept the region going have been forced to close, putting most of the population out of work. As bad as this situation is already, there are reports of people going missing, dropping all their belongings and heading out of house and home, disappearing into the wilderness. While the police are preoccupied dealing with worker unrest and growing crime, the government itself will have to solve the case. \n\nA commission has been formed to investigate the disappearances, with the only common denominator being absolute poverty."
swe_flavor.21.a:0 "Strange"

swe_flavor.22.t:0 "The Slow Return"
swe_flavor.22.d:0 "Kirunasvenskarna, the Kiruna Swedes as the local media calls the missing destitute, have been found. The commission tasked to track then down have finally presented a report on their findings, and it is a properly grim read. \n\nWhen Black Monday struck and the mines closed, the poor and destitute caught wind of a development not too far away, in Russian Karelia. Here, it was promised that industrious Swedes would be hired to do good work for good pay, building roads, establishing communities, all while being guaranteed days of rest, even to visit Sweden during semester. It was not to be. \n\nShortly after arrival in Karelia they became targets of the local secret police. After days of hard work, the men would be grabbed out from their homes for interrogation, most of them never to be seen again. The children were put in schools where there was little to no food available, and getting medical care meant walking for miles through scorching summers and terrifying winters. When the promised semester arrived, one family were horrified to find out that the promise of being sent back home did not apply to their children, who were forced into an orphanage until their return. \n\nWhile a slow trickle of returnees arrive at our borders, telling tales of horror and abuse, perhaps the most haunting tales have yet to be shared, the keepers of which are trapped in Siberia, in prisons, or in the ground."
swe_flavor.22.a:0 "Herregud, they return!"

swe_flavor.23.t:0 "Greetings from Karelia!"
swe_flavor.23.d:0 "Kirunasvenskarna, the Kiruna Swedes as the local media calls the missing destitute, have been found. A steady trickle of letters have arrived back in Sweden, sent from a few villages in Karelia, and the commission tasked with the investigation verify the claims made within. \n\nSome of the letters contain money, but all contain well wishes and information about how they are living well, or at least better than before. The unskilled labourers became employed by the government to build roads from a village called Ukhtah all the way to Kem, whereas those skilled in mining ended up employed in Hibinogorsk, some distance from Murmansk, all receiving their pay and promised privileges. Although it's not exactly a utopia, the commission is content to simply label the entire affair a benign emigration, not entirely unlike that to the Americas."

swe_flavor.26.d:0 "The famed von Rosen family have long since dabbled in matters of the more esoteric. From donating a plane to the whites in the Finnish civil war, to serving the crown in all manner of roles, indulging in the spiritual secrets of ancient Thule all the while, the von Rosen family have a lot on their plates. For Björn von Rosen however, young scion of the noble family, nature is his main passion. Unlike his brother Carl Gustaf von Rosen, an active pilot and daredevil mercenary, Björn has a passion for animals of all stripes and colours, in particular dogs. \n\nGrowing up, Björn was always infatuated with a strange type of short stocky yet surprisingly lean dog that occupied most of the farms in his area. Small and somewhat fluffy, eager to bark and protect livestock, it had a distinctive look about it that-to Björn at least-means that its surely a breed of dog worth preserving. Sadly however, Björn has not seen such a dog in several decades. Still, as an aristocrat with a passion for nature, Björn von Rosen brought the matter up with fellow nature enthusiast and dog-enjoyer K-G Zetterstén, who has decided to join Björn on a bicycle trip throughout the countryside to save this lost canine."

swe_flavor.27.t:0 "von Rosen vindicated!"
swe_flavor.27.d:0 "After weeks of scouring through Varaslätten, a vast expanse of farmland in Västragötaland, von Rosen and his exhausted companion Zetterstén have struck gold. After visiting farm after farm, tracking down dog after dog, an inventory has been made of the remaining breed, and the two have finally been able to register the breed as a unique, not just a peculiar style of mutt. \n\nThe two have purchased enough dogs to secure the future of the breed, and it is widely believe that thanks to their intervention, the fate of the larger but tragically extinct Dalbohund has been avoided. Already it is believed that this dog, the newly minted Svensk Vallhund, is in fact an ancient breed even used by the old vikings! While the Svenska Kennelklubben-the authority on all things canine-argues on if the breed should be named simply Svensk Vallhund or Västgötaspets, von Rosen has recently heard word of another breed that needs saving, further up north."
swe_flavor.27.a:0 "A big dog in a small body"

swe_flavor.28.t:0 "The Noble, the Painter, the Dog"
swe_flavor.28.d:0 "For close to two decades now a fervent debate has been raging within the halls of the Svenska Kennelklubben. On one side stands the advocates of a breed they call Jämthund, and on the other side stands those who deem it simply a mutt. Too large to count as simply a variant of the Norwegian Elkhound, yet too small to be some kind of fighting dog, the advocates of the Jämthund want to put it into the books as its own independent breed. Now, bolstered by his uncovering of the shorter Svensk Vallhund, von Rosen has joined in the debate, supporting the fervent advocate Aksel Lindström, famed painter. \n\nArguing that the breed is unique and not just a variation from Norwegian stock, Lindström presents several arguments as to why the dog is special, how different it is, and how the people in Jämtland use it. Indeed, Lindström also tell a macabre fairytale about how the breed is descended from a large dog owned by king Olav of Norway, and thus also of viking make. For Lindström it is very much a personal matter, as he has ventured through the countryside tracking down individual dogs not unlike that of von Rosen and Zetterstén. Following his inventory Lindström bought as many dogs as he could of the breed he had seen in his youth, and claims to have singlehandedly saved the breed from extinction, constantly swarmed by thirty or so dogs at his home. It is this commitment that first alerted von Rosen to the cause of the Jämthund, which allowed the debate over the breed to go national. As the debate rages on, the fate of the breed lies in balance."
swe_flavor.28.a:0 "Goodness!"

swe_flavor.29.t:0 "Vindication"
swe_flavor.29.d:0 "It took time and it took energy. It took endless meetings and countless newspaper articles. It took books and one or two personal insults. Lindström has been vindicated. The Jämthund, used by people in Jämtland for a supposed thousand years or more, has finally been recognized.\n\nAlready a new club has been established just for the breed, and active efforts are being made to ensure it lives on and prospers for another thousand years, as a link between past and present. For Lindström this is indeed a very personal matter. Having seen the breed go from prevalent in his youth to just a few handful spread out across a landscape so vast, he has almost singlehandedly saved it. As one can expect, the man is deemed a hero by his supporters, and his detractors have all conveniently become mute following the decision from the Svenska Kennelklubben to admit the breed into its ranks."

newsswe.1.t:0 "1936 Swedish Elections"
newsswe.1.d:0 "The ballots have been counted, and the results of the 1936 general elections in Sweden are in. Despite growing concerns over political radicalization across Europe, the Swedish people have once again demonstrated their commitment to parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson's Social Democratic Party has emerged as the clear victor, securing a strong mandate to continue their policies of social welfare, neutrality, and economic reform.\n\nFears that the far-left Socialistiska Samlingspartiet Vänster (SSV) might gain ground proved unfounded, as the party failed to secure a single seat in the Riksdag. This outcome has allowed Hansson to confidently rule out any coalition with the extremists, thereby reinforcing Sweden’s political stability in these uncertain times.\n\nWith the support of the monarchy and a firm popular backing, Sweden now looks to the future with cautious optimism. Hansson's administration is expected to focus on modernizing infrastructure, strengthening social programs, and maintaining neutrality amidst the rising tide of Syndicalism across Europe. Whether this course will hold steady in the face of global upheaval remains to be seen."

newsswe.2.d:0 "In a stunning turn of events, Sweden has undergone a full-scale political upheaval. The SSV, having secured a narrow but significant electoral victory, wasted no time in reshaping the foundations of Swedish governance. The monarchy, a centuries-old institution, was swiftly dismantled as King Gustaf was forced to abdicate under mounting pressure.\n\nTensions reached a boiling point when a faction of reactionary military officers launched an attempted coup against the new regime. However, their plan unraveled as many rank-and-file soldiers defected and joined the burgeoning workers' militia. In the early morning, fighting broke out near the Riksdag, but the uprising was swiftly quelled. The rogue generals were arrested, their ambitions crushed by the very soldiers they once commanded.\n\nAlthough the revolution has solidified the SSV’s grip on power, cracks are already beginning to show within the revolutionary movement itself. Factional disputes and ideological rifts simmer just beneath the surface. Still, one thing is certain, the red flag now flies high over Stockholm, and Sweden’s path forward is irrevocably changed."

But the old guard was not ready to go quietly. Tensions finally snapped when a faction of high-ranking military officers, led by General Helge Jung, launched a coordinated counter-revolution. At dawn, troops marched on Stockholm, surrounding the Riksdag. A brief but brutal firefight erupted as loyalist militias attempted to defend the socialist government. Outgunned and outmaneuvered, they fell quickly.\n\nBy mid-morning, radio stations and newspapers across the country broadcast the military's declaration, the Riksdag was dissolved, a provisional military council had assumed authority, and a national purge of 'red elements'. In a sweeping crackdown, socialist leaders, union heads, and suspected sympathizers were arrested or forced into hiding.With order forcibly reestablished, the military announced the restoration of the monarchy. Prince Gustaf Adolf has now been crowned as King Gustaf VI, a symbolic move aimed at projecting stability and continuity. Despite royal ceremonies and public reassurances, real power remains firmly in the hands of the military."

As part of the debris of the German sphere, by all accounts it is expected that they will be destroyed by syndicalist forces soon. For Sweden, this situation is highly inconvenient as a syndicalist regime in Denmark could potentially allow a separate syndicalist invasion of our own homeland, and therefore our officers have made a plan: we invade Denmark first and depose the Danish government in favor of a regime friendly to us, thereby creating a buffer zone between us and the syndicalists of mainland Europe."

### old kr events ###

swe.1.t:0 "Black Monday Arrives in Sweden"
swe.1.d:0 "Two weeks ago, the German stock market imploded and now the waves have come crashing to our shores as first the Stockholmsbörsen followed the fate that played out in Berlin and soon after the rest of the economy followed suit.\nSince the Weltkrieg, Sweden has become highly dependent on German trade, joining its organisation of Mitteleuropa together with Denmark. As such, our trade relations became increasingly one-sided, being aimed at countries in the tariff-free zone: Germany, Denmark and the German puppet states on the Baltic coast, at the cost of other trading partners such as Norway and Great Britain, with whom trading is subject to tariffs, or, in the latter case, even embargoes."
swe.1.a:0 "Herre min skapare!"

swe.2.t:0 "Per Albin Hansson Criticizes Our Crisis Response"
swe.2.d:0 "Per Albin Hansson, leader of the Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Arbetareparti (SAP) and widely considered to be the foremost leader of the opposition, has sharply condemned the Bagge-cabinet’s response to the ongoing economic upheaval, calling their faith in non-intervention dangerous and damaging to Sweden.\nHe once again has called out in favour of his own ‘Folkhemmet’ program that he claims will actually protect those that have lost their jobs to the crisis originating in Germany."
swe.2.a:0 "We are doing what we can!"

swe.3.t:0 "Rising SSV Membership"
swe.3.d:0 "Although the opposition is clearly led by the SAP, two smaller parties are active as well: the Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) which would identify as radical socialists who are strongly in favour of the cause of the so-called Third Internationale and the Bondeförbundet, a social liberal centrist party.\nEspecially the former party is seeing sharp increases in its membership over the years as the social democratic failure to dethrone the perpetual conservative government causes radicalisation amongst its ranks."
swe.3.a:0 "We can only welcome the left fracturing!"

swe.4.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Supports the Bagge Cabinet"
swe.4.d:0 "Long-time prime minister and former leader of the Allmänna Valmansförbundet (AV/General Electoral League) Arvid Lindman has publicly spoken out in favour of the government, declaring his utmost faith in Bagge and rallying voters to support the party he used to lead to the polls.\nLindman has ruled Sweden from 1906 to 1911 and then ruled continuously from 1924 until his retirement in 1934. Many consider his charismatic personality the foremost reason that the conservatives did not lose control to the social democrats like in Denmark. Many doubt whether Bagge will similarly be able to conserve General Electoral League dominance in Swedish politics, and many view the elections of 1936 - the first elections with Bagge as the conservative leader - as influential in determining this."
swe.4.a:0 "Thank you, old friend!"

swe.5.t:0 "SAP Refuses to Rule out Cooperation with Radicals"
swe.5.d:0 "Shocking news as Hansson refuses to rule out the formation of a coalition with the SSV if the outcome would be so that it would be the most democratic to do so.\nThe SSV’s open desire to end the Swedish system as it is in favour of a socialist form of government like in France and Britain (though with Swedish characteristics as outlined in their party program) causes the utmost concern amongst those in the right wing."
swe.5.a:0 "The SAP shows its true colors!"

swe.6.t:0 "A Vote for the SAP Is a Vote for Paris!"
swe.6.d:0 "As a result of the news that the social democrats are open to cooperation with outright radicals, the General Electoral League has started a propaganda war. They openly target SAP voters, claiming the SAP supports the Third Internationale and that any vote for them would directly correlate to a vote for the syndicalist regime in France.\nDespite a sharp SAP rebuke of this rhetoric, and while few actual SAP voters will be swayed by this, it does seem to have successfully played on the emotions of the liberal Folkpartiet voters to the League, who start to consider the SAP a very real danger to their fortunes. They start to see the AV as a much more capable faction to stand up against the SAP’s wicked plans than the Folkpartiet."
swe.6.a:0 "Nothing personal, Andersson..."

swe.7.t:0 "Debate over the Military Expenses"
swe.7.d:0 "As the election approaches, and Gösta Bagge and his minister have to consider the very real possibility of a potential defeat, the government has scheduled a debate to approve at least the Swedish budget of 1936 with the current Riksdag. The Bagge cabinet seeks to maintain the heavy investments in the military to which the social democratic opposition is heavily opposed, claiming that there is no direct threat to Sweden at this time and that the money would be better spent elsewhere to make the lives of Swedes better. The conservatives try to counter to this by arguing that the global tensions are rising and that worrisome events in Norway and Finland could directly threaten Sweden in the future. The government holds a majority in the Riksdag so the budget will definitely pass, but the prevailing argument could bring the party that brings it up closer to electoral victory in the coming elections.\nExperts agree that..."
swe.7.a:0 "...the opposition completely trashed the budget proposal."
swe.7.b:0 "...the conservatives capably defended their budget for the year."
swe.7.c:0 "...the Folkpartiet saved Bagge from a disgrace."

swe.8.t:0 "1936 Swedish Riksdag Elections"
swe.8.d:0 "The election campaign of 1936 has been dominated by underhanded tactics, stirred up emotions and thinly veiled threats. At this point, the only certainty is that whoever will stand victorious after this election will need to cooperate with others to secure a majority. If the Social Democrats stand to be victorious and they would follow through with their threat to cooperate with the SSV, serious trouble is to be expected. If the conservatives win instead, Bagge will secure his position as the carrier of Lindman’s legacy, but doubt will undoubtedly be sowed about the legitimacy of this election by disgruntled socialists."
swe.8.a:0 "The SAP triumphs!"
swe.8.b:0 "The AV remains on top!"

swe.9.t:0 "Cabinet Hansson I"
swe.9.d.start: "For the second time in history, the first time being in 1919, the Swedish social democrats, united in their SAP party have secured a clear electoral victory over our rivals, especially the General Electoral League of Gösta Bagge.\n\n"
swe.9.d.nomajority: "$swe.9.d.start$We do not possess an absolute majority, however, $swe.9.d.finish$"
swe.9.d.majority: "$swe.9.d.start$Despite our widespread support among the population, we have achieved not a parliamentary majority, $swe.9.d.finish$"
swe.9.d.finish: "and will need to form an alliance with one of the other parties in the Riksdag. During the campaign already, we left the door open to work together with the radically socialist SSV, which will likely be the most straightforward path to achieving socialism by democratic means, but it would be a major upset and is likely to bring the Swedish right up in arms. Alternatively, we could form an alliance with the agrarian Bondeförbundet: this would likely require compromise on our vision, but it wouldn't nearly polarise Swedish politics as much.\n\nWhichever option we choose, Lindman's conservative era seems finally behind us and a new Sweden shall rise from it!"
swe.9.a:0 "We will work towards socialism with the SSV!"
swe.9.b:0 "We shall partner with the Bondeförbundet!"

swe.10.t:0 "Cabinet Bagge II"
swe.10.d:0 "Many thought Gösta Bagge incapable of maintaining the legacy of his predecessor Arvid Lindman, but they were proven wrong: once more, the General Electoral League triumphed at the polls, trumping the social democratic SAP.\nDespite our glorious but successful defence of our plurality, we have not been able to secure an outright majority and thus the Riksdag is hung. If we are to form a government we shall have to cooperate with one of the other parties: either we could continue the Bagge I cabinet by continuing our cooperation with the liberal Folkpartiet with whom we can find strong agreement on economic matters, or we could agree to form a coalition with the agrarian Bondeförbundet, which might be a better match on the social aspect of governance."
swe.10.a:0 "An Agrarian-Conservative government looms!"
swe.10.b:0 "We shall continue with the Folkpartiet!"

swe.11.t:0 "The Abolition of the Monarchy"
swe.11.d:0 "One of the conditions of the SSV was that the monarchy be abolished. According to them, this ancient institution was a mere tool of the reactionaries to hold Sweden back from advancing to socialism. The SAP was mostly indifferent to this standpoint and its outright republican wing was small, but eventually the desire to rule with fellow socialists won out.\nSince the instruments of government, which serves as the Swedish constitution, can be amended by a simple majority in the Riksdag, now commanded by the SAP-SSV coalition, this was easily enacted, despite unanimous opposition and the harsh condemnation by the Gösta Bagge and his General Electoral League, now an opposition party."
swe.11.a:0 "I hope this will be worth the trouble..."

swe.12.t:0 "A Cold Morning in [GetMonth]..."
swe.12.d:0 "It was still early in the morning when suddenly a group of men knocked violently on the door of Per Albin Hansson's house at Ålstensgatan 40. When the door opened, a coarse military voice spoke up: 'Per Albin Hansson, by orders of the new government you are under arrest for treason!'\n\nAll over the city of Stockholm, brigades of soldiers have occupied strategic spots and government buildings: from the many bridges of the city, to the Riksdaghuset, the Swedish parliament, uniformed Swedish soldiers are present. Just after dawn, army general Oscar Nygren read a statement on the national radio, declaring the 'treasonous crypto-syndicalist government with the intent of destroying Sweden's legacy forever' of Hansson neutralized and that a temporary junta directed by an organisation called the 'Arméns Fosterlandsvänner' will soon restore the old order 'from before the fraudulous elections of this year'. He cited several misdeeds that prompted the military to intervene like this, but it becomes increasingly clear that it was the sudden abolishment of the monarchy that convinced the last conservative military leaders that Hansson does not only seek to put them out of a job by reducing spending on the military, but that he also seeks to make Sweden a puppet of Paris."
swe.12.a:0 "Sweden shall be cleansed of crypto-syndicalism!"
swe.12.b:0 "The Coup is Defeated, the Republic is Secure!"

swe.13.t:0 "Worker's Militias Form!"
swe.13.d:0 "A year ago, he would have been ignored and swiftly arrested by a government, but today, Anton Nilson and his several companions' message would be heard. Armed with weapons, this group of socialists seized a broadcasting station of Radiotjänst in the city of Malmö, to send out a message of resistance against the reactionary menace that is attacking the government and undoing the steps that are to be set.\nIt worked, despite the militant socialist voice behind it, Swedes from across the country formed militias: from liberals to social democrats to hardcore syndicalists, this violation of the democratic process would not be accepted gladly. Before long, worker's militias in stockholm, filled with labourers with a brave desire to save their country from military tyranny! Soon the sides stood eye to eye at the first strategic points. The mob was scantly armed, and what happened next would change Sweden forever:"
swe.13.a:0 "Machine guns were whipped out and the street was cleared in minutes!"
swe.13.b:0 "The soldiers, common men themselves, joined them against their rogue superiors!"

swe.14.t:0 "Successful Coup d'Etat"
swe.14.d:0 "The rest of the day was a blur characterized by scant information; more worker's militias rose, but the soldiers carrying out the coup remained dedicated and lacking arms, they were quickly mowed down by machine gun fire if they refused to disperse. As the sun began setting, Stockholm and most other major cities had fallen to military control. Malmö, the breeding nest of the loyalist resistance and home of the revolutionary radio message, had surrendered to government forces by dawn the next morning.\nIn Stockholm, Oscar Nygren as head of the junta officially appointed his cabinet among those backing his coup. With the Arméns Fosterlandsvänner divided into three competing factions, deciding which officer shall be the new prime minister will be key in determining the next steps that are to be taken."
swe.14.a:0 "Carl August Ehrensvärd of the reformist faction!"
swe.14.b:0 "Helge Jung, the balanced candidate!"
swe.14.c:0 "Archibald Douglas of the extremist faction!"

swe.15.t:0 "Failed Coup d'Etat"
swe.15.d:0 "The rest of the day was a blur characterized by scant information; more and more militias rose, and more and more soldiers defected to the worker's cause, leaving their rogue companies outgunned. This naturally culminated in a frenzied charge on the riksdaghuset in the late afternoon, which was occupied by the most loyal putschists, and by the end of the day, the militias controlled all major cities in Sweden.\nAs the dust began to settle, two things became clear: first, the social democratic government had completely incinerated during the coup. This became especially clear when a totalist-aligned militia found the corpse of Per Albin Hansson, murdered by the military, they clarified. He was immediately declared a martyr of the Swedish revolution. Secondly, a syndicalist republic based on the models of Britain and France has been born. While it was true that many militiamen had been liberals and social democrats, the death of Hansson convinced many of them that a firmer hand was needed, and those dissenting that policy fell prey to the first totalist tactics in hunting counterrevolutionaries, with the silent acceptance of the other socialists."
swe.15.a:0 "A new Sweden has been born today!"

swe.16.t:0 "Totalist Reign of Terror"
swe.16.d:0 "The dust had been settling after the failed attempt of the forces of reaction to chain the people in the fields in the following week. Still, the early days of the socialist republic were tumultuous and bloody. The totalist paramilitary organisations that had been making moderates disappear in the late stages of the violence, shifted their scope from crypto-reactionaries, skilfully posing as loyal comrades to subvert the worker's momentum, to the open reactionaries that had been ruling Sweden for decades, years, centuries and that had never been pretending otherwise than to control the working class. In the other factions, voices started to arise to put a stop to these practices, often executed with vicious tactics, although it was clear that in the anarchist atmosphere following the establishment of the worker's state, not everyone could be saved."
swe.16.a:0 "Let them have their fun, it can only safeguard the revolution!"
swe.16.b:0 "Restrain them for as much as we can, we are not barbarians!"

swe.17.t:0 "Swedish Refugees"
swe.17.d:0 "Sweden has fallen prey to the socialist scourge that has been plaguing Europe for a while. Following the successful establishment of a worker's state, local totalists have taken their chance to take their revenge on Swedish capitalists, politicians, priests and other men of the old Swedish regime. As a result, many try to flee Sweden and unlike many of the other nations falling prey to this scourge, they don't have a colonial empire to rely on. As such they are seeking refuge in [Root.GetNameDef]. Several groups have already arrived at our border, but should we accept them?"
swe.17.a:0 "Welcome in [Root.GetNameDef]!"
swe.17.b:0 "Turn away, Swedish scum!"

swe.18.t:0 "Militant Socialists"
swe.18.d:0 "You are travelling by motorcarriage in the countryside of Stockholm when it comes to a sudden halt. The road has been blocked by a fallen tree, and the driver explains that you will have to make a slight detour on an isolated dirt road."
swe.18.a:0 "Very well, but this had better not delay us!"

swe.19.t:0 "Militant Socialists"
swe.19.d:0 "After less than half a league on the small path, your motorcarriage gets stuck in the mud and you are ambushed and surrounded by militant socialists! They send your driver on his way, explaining that their interest lies with you alone. You try to call for your guards, but they merely laugh at this - it is they too who want your blood."
swe.19.a:0 "Y-you're not socialists!"

swe.20.t:0 "Douglas Declares Himself Riksledare"
swe.20.d:0 "Following the unfortunate discovery of the death of our dear leader Oscar Nygren at the hands of militant socialists, Archibald Douglas has taken over his status as head of the junta. Douglas immediately merged the post with his post of prime minister he already held under the name of 'Riksledare' and declared over national radio that 'considering the apparent strength of the socialist menace, the restoration of the old government would henceforth be suspended for an undefined time and that the military regime would stay in control for the foreseeable future."
swe.20.a:0 "The socialists are vicious, but our Riksledare is strong!"

swe.21.t:0 "Military Tribunals"
swe.21.d:0 "After order was swiftly restored, the first military tribunals were formed. While a large part of the judges in the normal judicial system had been appointed by conservative ministers of justice, the junta was wary that those given a permanent mandate by the social democratic ministers of justice in the early 1920s would deliver their fair share of embarrassing acquittals to traitors, some of whom were affiliated with said party.\nTo prevent this from happening, this new instance will convict everyone the military needs out of the way regarding the coup, from socialists who had been resisting the coup in the streets to those that were part of the Hansson government."
swe.21.a:0 "First trial..."

swe.22.t:0 "Hansson v. Sweden"
swe.22.d:0 "The first man to be brought before the tribunals was now-former prime minister Per Albin Hansson. This traitor had been seeking to subvert Sweden and misused the trust of the people to take their freedom away by establishing a syndicalist tyranny. Luckily his wicked plans have been disrupted by the brave and selfless actions of the military. Unluckily for Hansson, the prosecutor is part of Douglas's faction and not forgiving: he demands the death penalty for this syndicalist, but according to Swedish law the death penalty may only be imposed in times of war. As such, the main argument between prosecution and Hansson's defence is whether the coup could identify as times of war, which would decide whether Hansson could be executed or would merely be imprisoned for life for his crimes. After that, the tribunal brings in the verdict which likely sets the tone for the other trials to come..."
swe.22.a:0 "...that Hansson be imprisoned for life."
swe.22.b:0 "...that Hansson be executed."

swe.23.t:0 "Restoration of the Monarchy?"
swe.23.d:0 "The original intentions of the military men who seized control of the apparatus of state was to restore the government as it was before that faithful day of 20 September 1936, with perhaps a few extra safeguards to make sure that these tragic syndicalist infiltrations would never happen again. As such, it would be necessary to prevent the social democrats from partaking in future elections and the king, who has been painfully passive in the whole crisis, will not be brought back. Instead we shall put the grandson of the king on the throne, the duke of Västerbotten, who is known to harbour strong anti-syndicalist opinions, is an officer and who will therefore keep the nation safe.\nHowever, some in the military government instead consider that bringing back the monarchy and civilian government will only endanger their interests, and they would rather announce an extension of the military control of the country."
swe.23.a:0 "Announce the imminent restoration of 'democracy'."
swe.23.b:0 "Extend the suspension of the instruments of state!"

swe.24.t:0 "Gustaf VI Adolf Swears the Royal Oath"
swe.24.d:0 "As per the junta's promise, the monarchy has been restored today. In a grand ceremony, prince Gustaf Adolf, grandson of former king Gustaf V, has sworn the royal oath and has officially become Sweden's king as is his birthright, shortly after the law in restoring the monarchy entered into power after being affirmed by the Riksdag."
swe.24.a:0 "Long live the king!"

swe.25.t:0 "The king Appoints the New Government"
swe.25.d:0 "After the Swedish crown landed solidly on the new king's head, the transition from junta back to democracy swiftly continued. Shortly after his oath, the junta announced their resignation and a civilian government was to be established once more: with the SAP forced underground and their seats vacant, the General Electoral League enjoyed a comfortable majority among the remaining seats in the Riksdag, and thus the king asked Gösta Bagge to form a government once more. One of the last acts of the junta was entrenching the royal reserve powers that got shafted after the crisis, but it remains to be seen whether the new king will actually use them."
swe.25.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.26.t:0 "The Establishment of the Ehrensvärd Cabinet"
swe.26.d:0 "The reality was that Oscar Nygren was just a mediocre authoritative figure. Slowly, control of the factionalized junta was slipping away and taking advantage of this, general Carl August Ehrensvärd was there to help in governing the country. More and more responsibilities of Nygren were shifted to Ehrensvärd and his supporters, to the point where Nygren was little more than a puppet of the clique of Ehrensvärd. His retirement in favour of Ehrensvärd was a matter of time by then. Being much more talented for rulership, Ehrensvärd immediately shuffled the cabinet to be filled with loyalists, and thus the moderate arm of the AFV would be in control for the foreseeable future."
swe.26.a:0 "A natural process"

swe.27.t:0 "The Jung Junta"
swe.27.d:0 "Oscar Nygren isn't the most authoritative figure and scheming in his factionalized junta was the order of the day. As a result, Nygren's control was slipping away and general Helge Jung, who was present when the plans for the coup formed and the one to nominate Nygren as a weak candidate all three factions could rally behind. Needless to say, as Nygren, in part because of the tiresome scheming in his government, let it be known he intended to resign from his post, it was Jung who had gathered the support needed to take over in his wake, and quickly filled the brief power vacuum caused by it. Soon, those opposing Jung found themselves replaced by the fresh ruler and the ruling junta became synanimous with the so-called 'Jung junta'."
swe.27.a:0 "Helge Jung is the true saviour we deserve!" 

swe.28.t:0 "The Formation of the Douglas Regime"
swe.28.d:0 "Oscar Nygren was perhaps not that skilled in ruling, and he realised himself this. Few would fail to notice the slow expansion of the Douglas clique within the junta, but Nygren indeed did not. Or at the very least, he must have underestimated the threat they posed, because it still came as a surprise when pro-Douglas soldiers entered his office, pressed a proposal for a law into his hands with the message to pass it: the junta would be finished, and the Riksdag would be extended with the seats which had been left vacant after the coup by the SSV and SAP. All these seats would be transferred to a new party called the 'Svea Rike Nationella Samlingsparti', led by Douglas. Once the formalities were over, the Riksdag affirmed with a law to amend the instruments of government the office of Riksledare which would be capable of overruling the Riksdag by decree and granted the office to Archibald Douglas, giving him unlimited power within Sweden."
swe.28.a:0 "A civil government is back... But it is... Different..."

swe.29.t:0 "The Dissolution of the Landsorganisationen"
swe.29.d:0 "It was no secret that the trade unions of Sweden, unified in the so-called Landsorganisationen, as well as those unified in the Central Worker's Organisation of Sweden (SAC), supported the old treacherous government. In the aftermath of the coup, many of these trade unions tried to organise strikes against the new government, with limited success. After some time, the junta did what was necessary and dissolved all trade unions."
swe.29.a:0 "Good riddance"

swe.30.t:0 "The Reestablishment of Trade Unions"
swe.30.d:0 "The ideologues of the SRNS considered it vital to reestablish worker's interest organisations for the nation to regain the working class' support. Several factions have arrived at the office of the Riksledare: the first one supports the establishment of a Guild System that is unique to Sweden. This would make all labourers members of guilds that will be established for their craft that can be freely joined if one switches carreers or starts at the labour market. Companies will be banned from contracting people who are not part of a guild and the guild will represent its members in labour negotiations.\nThe second proposal is to allow the trade unions to organise again, albeit under strict government control.\nLastly, some argue that trade unions in whatever form or terminology are harmful to Swedish society and should remain banned as it is."
swe.30.a:0 "The Guild system faction prevails"
swe.30.b:0 "Trade Unions are reestablished under strict government control"
swe.30.c:0 "Trade Unions remain banned"

swe.31.t:0 "The Guild System"
swe.31.d:0 "A year into the new 'Guild' system, we can conclude that it is rather successful. Even though critical eyes conclude that is just yet another way of the SRNS to control society, after all the implementation of 'Gilleledares' - Guild Leaders loyal to the regime - means that it allows the regime to exclude dissidents from society by excluding them from their craftmanship and even the labour market as a whole, the reality that suddenly all Swedish worker's are represented in labour negotiations has made barbarous practices like Statare untenable and the regime, previously considered one belonging to the rich, much more popular among the lower classes of Sweden."
swe.31.a:0 "Rich and poor Swedes stand together in the quest for the greater!"

swe.32.t:0 "The State of the Trade Unions"
swe.32.d:0 "Half a year after trade unions were, under significant government surveillance, allowed to function again, the results have sadly been disappointing. Instead of taking their new allegiance seriously, we immediately saw a revival of syndicalism in its ranks and the government was soon forced to act. Troublemakers were soon evicted from the trade unions and government control took the momentum once again, but as a result few workers consider the trade unions as they are a legitimate body defending their interests. To many, they are just organisations under the thumb of the bourgeoise government and the very bosses they are supposed to oppose."
swe.32.a:0 "Cut our losses, ban them again."
swe.32.b:0 "Make membership mandatory to force participation!"

swe.33.t:0 "The Trade Unions"
swe.33.d:0 "After the government decreed that everyone partake in the unions, they were suddenly packed with uninterested workers who reluctantly attended the union meetings. The legitimacy remained low, but with a lot of government pushing participation started to rise and after some time, some concessions convinced some more workers that there was merit in this system. As a result the controlled union system has become somewhat of a self-sustaining organism but it is probably still not what the Riksledare and the ideologues intended it to be."
swe.33.a:0 "Tell the press it's a great success!"

swe.34.t:0 "A Riksledare and an Archbishop"
swe.34.d:0 "The SRNS recognized the moral authority held over the Swedish people by the church of Sweden. In fact, gaining the support of this body was one reason the small Swedish Jewish community had seen protection by the Riksledare from the less racially inclusive elements in his cabinet, as the archbishop was known to oppose antisemitism. Because of these reasons, it was no surprise that Archibald Douglas and the archbishop of Uppsala, Erling Eidem met regularly. Douglas was willing to pass substantial laws favouring the church of Sweden, for instance to restore the legislation that rendered it illegal to leave the church as well as cracking down on sinful activities. In return however, the church would have to actively remove progressive anti-government clergy and openly support the Riksledare. Based on his conversation with the Riksledare, Erling called a synod to discuss the issue."
swe.34.a:0 "Let the synod run its course..."
swe.34.b:0 "Help the decision-making by visiting anti-government clergy."

swe.35.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.35.d:0 "The synod of the church of Sweden has concluded and the priests have agreed that no earthly government the likes of that of the SRNS can have unequivocal support, and that in this light the democracy that existed before suffered from a lesser moral deficit. In addition, they agreed one can't bargain for God's support with legislation in support of His values. People need to open their hearts for it themselves after all. The clear outcome of the synod is a rejection of the SRNS doctrine.\nThe Riksledare ignited in outrage by the news and by the end of the day the Church of Sweden was no longer the state church, nor could many priests of the organisation, including Archbishop Erling, enjoy their freedom anymore."
swe.35.a:0 "B-but wrath is a sin?"

swe.36.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.36.d:0 "Strangely, many progressive clergymen did not arrive at the synod or suddenly changed their minds on the matter. However, the synod went ahead as planned: The clergymen that were actually present agreed that the execution of God's will was worth some concessions and that SRNS government was already carrying out God's will by persecuting heathenly syndicalists and protecting Sweden from this scourge.\nThe Riksledare was delighted by the news and from that point on the church of Sweden became a integral if at times somewhat reluctant part of the SRNS propaganda machine, with a topdown enforcement of orthodox government support and heavy government support for the church in return."
swe.36.a:0 "We shall hold our end of the bargain too!"

swe.37.t:0 "Transition to a Civil Government"
swe.37.d:0 "As time passed on, the military form of government became increasingly tenuous to maintain. It was therefore no surprise that at some point, the Riksledare declared all seats in the Riksdag to be part of his own party the 'Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti'. Once this was done, power was transferred to the Riksdag, which immediately moved to permanently affirm Douglas's status as Riksledare in a law that allowed the holder of said office to bypass the Riksdag itself in the Swedish instruments of government. At this point, the Riksledare possessed almost unlimited power and Sweden as it was known before the coup would be forever gone."
swe.37.a:0 "It's different but still the same."

swe.38.t:0 "The New Instruments of Government"
swe.38.d:0 "The Riksdag has passed a new set of instruments of government which serves as the Swedish constitution. The new document explicitly excludes parties subscribing to marxist or syndicalist thought, and entrenches the right of the Swedish monarch to exercise its reserve powers, as well as other minor amendments that heavily favour the conservative government."
swe.38.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.39.t:0 "Sweden Wants to Join the Internationale"
swe.39.d:0 "The Swedish revolutionary government has petitioned us with their desire to join the struggle for the world revolution. Shall we crush the bourgeoisie together with the Swedish worker?"
swe.39.a:0 "Definitely!"
swe.39.b:0 "We shall never stand in battle with those sockpuppets!"

swe.40.t:0 "France Accepts!"
swe.40.d:0 "We have received word from the communard government that we are welcome in the struggle against the forces of reaction and the dark forces of financial capitalism. Together we shall crush the bourgeoisie!"
swe.40.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.41.t:0 "France Rejects Us!"
swe.41.d:0 "The communards have let us know that we are not welcome on the battlefield against the forces of reaction. Apparently they consider us just another front that will not be held."
swe.41.a:0 "Curse those snail-eaters!"

swe.42.t:0 "A Statue for a True Revolutionary"
swe.42.d:0 "While Per Albin Hansson was not without his faults - he was very strongly in favour of the rather hopeless strategy of working within the bourgeoise government to amend it - the man has shown himself to be a true hero of the revolution. After all, it was clear that he was most definitely intending to bring about the establishment of this republic as evidenced by the abdication of the king he pushed. Sadly, this great hero of the revolution perished at the hands of the military at the opening stages of a coup. If it wasn't for the heroic actions of a SP militia, we may never have been able to find back his body.\nOf course, such a glorious revolutionary needs to be remembered, and for that reason we have commissioned a large statue in the city where Hansson grew up: Malmö."
swe.42.a:0 "A great statue for a great revolutionary!"

swe.43.t:0 "First Day of the Revolution"
swe.43.d:0 "Exactly one year ago, the vicious capitalist tyranny was washed away with the blood of the proletariat. Since it is important for Sweden's people to remember that Sweden's freedom does not come free, we have decided to declare the day of the revolution a national holiday. On this day, all workers will have a day off and the state will organise activities for the next generation while the adults have a chance to socialise!"
swe.43.a:0 "This will become a yearly event!"

swe.44.t:0 "Day of the Revolution"
swe.44.d:0 "Once more, it is the birthday of the revolution. The state has commissioned activities for the children of Sweden in honour of the revolution while the adults, who are let off work, use their free day with the children gone to socialise!"
swe.44.a:0 "Leve vår Revolution!"

swe.45.t:0 "Norway in the Internationale"
swe.45.d:0 "Many within the government considered the neutrality that has been de-facto maintained by Sweden since 1815 holy. However, Norway has fallen to the syndicalist menace, and, not only that: they joined the Third International of the French Commune and the Union of Britain. In addition, aggressive rhetoric towards 'the liberation of the evil capitalist tyranny of Sweden' is almost a daily occurrence among some in the rogue state that has spawned in the place of our wester neighbour.\n\nWith these threats and keeping in mind that their formal ascension to the Third International alliance may mean that the Norwegians will let loose their Anglo-French attack dogs on us, many consider it wise to abandon our neutrality, dear to us it may be, as the syndicalists won't have problems violating it and it would make us only vulnerable to attack, in favour of an alliance with the Germans, our avid trade partners and known rival to the Third International."
swe.45.a:0 "We should join the Reichspakt!"
swe.45.b:0 "Our Neutrality will hold, even in face of these new challenges!"

 swe.46.t: "Sweden Petitions to Join the Reichspakt"
 swe.46.d.NOR: "With heavy concerns, Sweden has been watching as their Norwegian neighbour collapsed to Syndicalism and started openly affiliating with the regimes in Paris and London. While the Swedish government values Sweden's tradition of neutrality, this was too great a threat to ignore and now they petition to stand with us as a combined vanguard against the red menace. And with their steel reserves at our disposal."
 swe.46.d.other: "The government of Sweden has been eyeing the recent developments in Europe with concern. While the Swedish nation has long prided itself on a tradition of neutrality, the growing threat of revolutionary socialists and the resurgent Russian state have ultimately pushed Stockholm to reconsider its isolationist stance. In a bid to secure its future, Sweden has petitioned to enter the Reichspakt - bringing their steel reserves with them."
 swe.46.a: "Welcome to the fight, Swedish Brethren!"
 swe.46.b: "They would be a mere burden to protect."

swe.47.t:0 "Germany Accepted Our Proposal"
swe.47.d:0 "We have received word from our embassy in Berlin that the imperial governments has approved of our petition to join their alliance as a vanguard against syndicalism!"
swe.47.a:0 "We stand together against anarchy!"

swe.48.t:0 "Germany Rejects Us"
swe.48.d:0 "The imperial government sees nothing in our proposal to stand together in alliance. It seems that we are on our own."
swe.48.a:0 "Neutrality it is, after all..."

swe.49.t:0 "The General Electoral League Changes Its Name"
swe.49.d:0 "Since their defeat in 1936, the fate of the conservative General Electoral League has been one of misfortune. The party has been seeing much of its support defecting to the Social Democrats of Hansson, and those who supported the League in opposition to the Social Democrats are going back to the Folkpartiet if the polls are to be believed.\nIn an attempt to rebrand the party that is now the bastion of right-wing opposition and to reverse its fortunes once more, party leadership has elected to change the partyname into the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation). Whether this tactic will be successful in attracting more voters once again, remains to be seen."
swe.49.a:0 "Interesting..."

swe.50.t:0 "The King Intends to Send a Letter"
swe.50.d:0 "His royal majesty has let us know his intention to send a letter to the German Kaiser. It seems he wants to thank the Germans for taking care of the syndicalist pest that is haunting Europe. Such a letter could potentially become embarrassing and damage our neutrality, so some in the government would like us to stop his majesty from sending this letter."
swe.50.a:0 "Strengthening our bonds with others can never hurt!"
swe.50.b:0 "We can't jeopardise our neutrality like this, forbid it!"

swe.51.t:0 "A Letter from the King of Sweden"
swe.51.d:0 "We have received a letter from King Gustaf V of Sweden. He thanks us for taking care of the syndicalist pest in France and congratulates us with the victories achieved so far. A most kind gesture from the Swedes to express their support for our cause like this."
swe.51.a:0 "Instruct our ambassador to thank them for this!"
swe.51.b:0 "A nice gesture indeed!"

swe.52.t:0 "German Thanks!"
swe.52.d:0 "The German ambassador has passed on his nation's thanks to one of our cabinet's ministers for the kind letter from our king supporting their cause against the syndicalists. They say it was a most kind gesture and that they consider us too to be good friends."
swe.52.a:0 "It was nice wasn't it? His majesty's own idea even!"
swe.52.b:0 "But we forb... No matter, splendid!"

swe.53.t:0 "Folkpartiet Rises in the Polls"
swe.53.d:0 "For a while, it seemed like disenfranchising the social democrats had made conservative control over Sweden unopposed. It seems however, that in their absence, the liberal Folkpartiet has risen to prominence, with much of the old social democratic support base now putting their weight behind them, knowing that while they do not espouse the same economic ideals as them, they do support bringing the SAP back into the legality and restoring freedom like it used to be before the conservatives made their control virtually impenetrable using the law."
swe.53.a:0 "A new challenger arises..."

swe.54.t:0 "The Folkpartiet Controls the Opposition"
swe.54.d:0 "For an extended amount of time, the conservatives have been the most influential party in Sweden, but this seems to be over. First they lost the government to the social democrats, and as they continued to fail to decisively recapture it, their performance at the polls has been declining. Last elections it has finally happened: with the conservatives once again winning the least amount of seats since the establishment of the modern Riksdag, they have lost their standing as the second-largest party and dropped to the third place in favour of the liberals, who will now take over the leadership over the Swedish opposition."

swe.57.t:0 "Conservative Government Formation"
swe.57.d:0 "The elections have been a clear victory for the conservatives, and as such it is only right that we will be the ones to form the Swedish government. The press is eagerly awaiting an announcement from the party as it will be instrumental in determining what kind of government will rule Sweden in the coming years."
swe.57.a:0 "We shall rule with the agrarians!"
swe.57.b:0 "The liberal Folkpartiet is our natural ally!"

swe.58.t:0 "Liberal Government Formation"
swe.58.d:0 "The liberals have decisively won the Riksdag in the elections, and as such it falls to the Folkpartiet to form the Swedish government. Many wonder what kind of government the liberals will cook up, and the press is eagerly awaiting the announcement."
swe.58.a:0 "A true liberal coalition with the Bondeförbundet"
swe.58.b:0 "A coalition with the conservatives, but under liberal leadership!"

swe.59.t:0 "Constitutional Amendments"
swe.59.d:0 "Many within both the liberal and agrarian parties had been agitated when the conservatives changed the instruments of government to disenfranchise a large part of the nation. Now that the Folkpartiet rules Sweden - ironically arguably due to the forceful exclusion of the social democrats - it is therefore no surprise that they roll back these changes. In addition, they have entrenched the instruments, so that henceforth a two-third majority will be required to amend the instruments."
swe.59.a:0 "Democratic integrity has been restored!"

swe.60.t:0 "Sweden Implements Tariffs"
swe.60.d:0 "The Swedes have implemented tariffs against us, despite the fact that they are part of the Mitteleuropa Free-Trade Zone and thus in principle banned from implementing such measures. Many economists feel we should retaliate against this measure, lest the integrity of Mitteleuropa be harmed and other members get ideas!"
swe.60.a:0 "We shall retaliate!"
swe.60.b:0 "We have bigger fish to fry right now!"

swe.61.t:0 "Germany Retaliates!"
swe.61.d:0 "The Germans have not taken lightly to our attempt to bend the rules in our favour: they have instituted their own sanctions against us and due to their economic weight, this hurts our companies - mainly specialised in raw resources - a lot more than our sanctions hit them. New lay-offs are being announced as Swedish companies now need to pay tariffs to reach the German and Danish markets."

swe.63.d:0 "The unemployment level has now fallen below 20%. With more and more people starting to find work again, the Swedish economy is recovering at an ever-increasing rate.

swe.68.d:0 "Terrible! It was known that the commission had been unorthodox with the usage of loans, but noone had expected that it would be this bad! The enormous debt the commission has incurred in their attempts to counter Black Monday's effects can't be accounted for with the rest of the Swedish budget and we are forced to declare that our debts can't be repaid, bankrupcy in effect!

swe.69.t:0 "Sovereign Debt Crisis in Sweden"
swe.69.d:0 "Sweden had long been considered a safe haven for investments, but not quite so anymore: this morning they have officially declared bankrupcy, apparently as a result of Black Monday: they are no longer capable of fulfilling their debts.

swe.71.t:0 "Hyperinflation"
swe.71.d:0 "Our decision to keep devaluing the Swedish Krona after it started to have an effect on our economy may have been a mistake. The inflation now started snowballing and everything is showing that the domestic price level will double twice this year.

swe.76.d:0 "The communal government of the capital - probably with encouragement of certain elements in our cabinet - has approved a motion to install loudspeakers with music and state propaganda in all public buildings encouraging the workers to do their part for the Swedish Revolution as well as advocating ideological purity. Many think this would be a great testing environment to see the effectiveness of such a doctrine of total propaganda, but some fear that the effects will be limited and that the enthousiastic approach of the communal government will only be counterproductive."

swe.76.b:0 "Tell them to cancel it, this won't work!"

swe.77.t:0 "Mediocre Effect of the Propagandaspeakers"
swe.77.d:0 "The extensive use of propagandaspeakers we let the communal government implement has had a mediocre effect it seems: while indeed the membership of totalist unions has increased marginally more than in the rest of the country, there have been several complaints that the loud noise of the loudspeakers keeps them out of their concentration (at work) or sleep (at night). Several loudspeakers have even been damaged and required replacement. It seems the experiment is moderately unsuccessful."
swe.77.a:0 "Extend the usage to all of Sweden!"
swe.77.b:0 "Have the experiment be abandoned!"

swe.78.t:0 "The Fate of the Press"
swe.78.d:0 "Following the establishment of the worker's state, an imminent problem was the press: most newspapers and as well as the national radio service remained active in the aftermath of the Swedish revolution and some of them even had the gall to criticise the new order.\n\nWhile all factions among the revolutionaries agreed that blatant bourgeoise propagandastations like the capitalist Svenska Dagbladet can obviously not remain active as it is, they all proposed a different approach. The Flyggists of the SP proposed their plan of 'Likriktning': all media in Sweden ought to be put under strict government surveillance to ensure the revolution remains well-protected from reactionary lies. The syndicalists of the SAC had a different proposition: all media should be reorganized in a single newswriters union under the general Swedish Landsorganisationen, which will ensure the content will be objective and not spread falsehoods to the detriment of the socialist order. Finally, the radical socialists of the SSV propose cautiousness; while they agree that obviously reactionary newsmedia should be dissolved, they want us to leave the rest of the media alone."
swe.78.a:0 "Likriktning: protect the revolution!"
swe.78.b:0 "Reorganisation: seize the means of information!"
swe.78.c:0 "Cautiousness: save the freedom of press!"

swe.79.t:0 "The Establishment of the Stasä"
swe.79.d:0 "Many non-totalist socialists were rather dissatisfied with the actions of the SP's paramilitary organisations against reactionaries. By their accounts, the hunt has cost the lives of many who could not even be considered a threat to the revolutionary order, and made it a lot harder to convince Swedes that did not yet subscribe to the revolution that this was really the best way forward.\n\nAs a result of this, they proposed to establish a new agency that would receive the sole authority to protect Sweden from counterrevolutionary activity and with official government support. Somewhat to their surprise, the totalists jumped right on this idea and propose far-reaching powers for this new 'Sekretariatet för Statssäkerhet' - it seems like they are hoping to gain control over it."
swe.79.a:0 "Let the hunt restart with new resources!"
swe.79.b:0 "Institute proper checks and balances."

swe.80.t:0 "Socialisation of the Economy in Practice"
swe.80.d:0 "With the decree from congress clear, the wealth that we took from domestic and foreign capitalist pigs around the Swedish nation is ready to be returned to the Swedish people with interest. Henceforth, the average Swede shall enjoy the prosperity it deserves without being a serf to plutocratic interests!"
swe.80.a:0 "Establish a strong union-based economy!"
swe.80.b:0 "Establish a single union to represent the working class!"
swe.80.c:0 "Establish a autonomous commune-based economy!"

swe.81.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf Bernadotte"
swe.81.d:0 "The nefarious symbol of reaction, Gustaf Bernadotte, who acted as the figurehead for his German reactionary-capitalist puppetmasters' exploitation of Sweden for almost 30 years, has died in exile, while still hoping to some day mend the chains that once shackled the people of Sweden. His son has taken over the mantle as pretender for the 'Swedish throne' and as figurehead for the Swedish exiles."
swe.81.a:0 "Good riddance!"

swe.82.t:0 "The Centralisation of Power"
swe.82.d:0 "After having been installed into power by the worker's mandate, the Totalisterna and now their general secretary immediately went to work. Some of the first actions of Nils Flyg as the general secretary was to relieve those senior officials that were hostile to the totalist thought and the doctrine of total commitments to the revolution from their duty and replacing them with loyal members of the movement."
swe.82.a:0 "You don't belong there if you aren't totally committed!"

swe.83.t:0 "Pacifying the Unions"
swe.83.d:0 "It didn't take long until the apparatus of state had been cleansed of anti-totalism. With the different positions around the government under totalist control, the main political threat to continued unity of Sweden were the unions, that could technically enforce a congress to force a change of government. To prevent crypto-reactionary revisionism from taking root again, the General Secretary announced that union leaders were to be subjected to political tests lest they lead their herd to the wrong end of the spectrum."
swe.83.a:0 "Swedes may not be deceived by revisionists!"

swe.84.t:0 "The Start of Something Greater!"
swe.84.d:0 "After a few months, the hold of the totalist movement over Swedish society had become near total.\nGeneral Secretary Nils Flyg often held speeches to rouse the Swedish people in favour of the national-revolutionary doctrine with his perfected talents for speeching. One day, after such a speech, the 'Folkets Dagblad' which the Swedish leader once redacted started with a front article lauding the great leadership of the General Secretary so far and his wisdom.\n\nThe Article has caught the attention of the leader and his cabinet, who start to consider that letting the media focus on the qualities of Nils Flyg could be politically beneficial."
swe.84.a:0 "Start to work on this 'Cult of Personality'!"
swe.84.b:0 "Our focus should be the revolution, not comrade Flyg!"

swe.85.t:0 "The Creation of a Cult"
swe.85.d:0 "During the last year, news has exacerbated the role of Nils Flyg in the revolution. Comrade Flyg's role in the revolution has become legendary, and it is widely portrayed that it was his decision to defend the revolution from liberals that made it possible to happen. In addition, schools have been instructed to portray Nils Flyg as a true Swedish hero and an example for all to follow and official photographs of the General Secretary adorn the carriages of public transport!"
swe.85.a:0 "Excellent, Comrade Flyg is an example to us all!"

swe.86.t:0 "The Writer's Union Wants to Write a Biography"
swe.86.d:0 "The Writer's Union has let us know that they intend to write a biography about our great leader Nils Flyg, from childhood to today. This is of course a great way to further the popular knowledge about their general secretary, but some discord started to boil over whether we - and comrade Nils in particular - should hold a tight leash on what is being written. Some in the cabinet want us to subject this endeavour under close government control, while others believe that in the knowledge that the Writer's Union is known to be politically correct means it wouldn't become a character assassination, and that if it would turn out in such a way we can always censor it before it is released."
swe.86.a:0 "We need to make sure the truth is written down!"
swe.86.b:0 "Let the writer's write as they would."

swe.87.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.87.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, like how the general secretary already made remarks about the inherent unfairness of the contemporary feudal-capitalist system that held Sweden in chains at the tender age of 8 years old and how bourgeoise spies that infiltrated the workers movement constantly tried to hinder Flyg's career, recognizing that he would liberate the Swedish worker if they couldn't control him, which eventually of course, they couldn't. The book ends in describing the instrumental role Flyg played in the Swedish revolution, which could be considered a departure from the government stance that had been held since the revolution, where the ultimate sacrifice of Per Albin Hansson was accredited as the main event that sowed the seeds for a revolutionary regime."
swe.87.a:0 "An excellent literary artwork!"
swe.87.b:0 "Lies upon lies, cancel the biography!"

swe.88.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.88.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, telling the story from his birth to his rise to power in the present day. In general the book is positive about Flyg's endeavours, praising for instance his capacity to self-educate in his early youth allowing him to rise among the many workers in the socialist movement at the beginning of the 20th century, but also strikes a critical tone at times: for instance the implication is made that the strength of the socialist movement was hurt a lot by Flyg's decision to move forward with his own party, which contributed to the fracturing of Swedish socialism. Indeed the book also puts some weight in criticising the absence of Flyg during the most uncertain hours of the revolution while totalist paramilitaries roamed the streets."
swe.88.a:0 "Criticism is healthy, go ahead!"
swe.88.b:0 "Oh no, I think not!"

swe.89.t:0 "The General Secretary Visits a Workplace"
swe.89.d:0 "In order to bring the touch of the regime closer to the people, the General Secretary, a former industrial worker himself, has arrived to visit a factory where Sweden's industrial heart beats the strongest. One of the civil servants of the secretariat of economics has in the meanwhile drafted a plan to increase the efficiency of factories such as these. One of the junior members of the General Secretary's entourage proposes disposing of the civil servant and bringing the idea as comrade Flyg's own in the ending speech he will give, which would show the wisdom of comrade Flyg to the Swedish people."
swe.89.a:0 "A cunning plan! Make the arrangements."
swe.89.b:0 "Laud the Civil Servant for his achievement!"

swe.90.t:0 "Nils Flyg has a Heart Attack"
swe.90.d:0 "Tragedy: our General Secretary, Nils Flyg, has been hit by a heart attack today. Fortunately, he survived the calamity, but after being rushed to the doctor the doctor explains that Flyg will never be the same again. He will likely suffer from short breath henceforth which will likely become progressively worse in the future. And there is a risk that he will suffer a second heart attack. The doctor recommends that comrade Flyg takes as much rest as possible."
swe.90.a:0 "Rest? The General Secretary of Sweden never rests!"

swe.91.t:0 "The General Secretary's Ill Health Starts to Become Public!"
swe.91.d:0 "Since comrade Flyg's heart attack, his short-breathedness has progressively become worse as the doctor predicted. As a result, the General Secretary eventually caved and dialed down his public appearances, which in turn is feeding the rumour among the Swedish populace that something is wrong with their General Secretary - with the news about the heart attack carefully being censored.\n\nBecause of our... zealous investment in the cult of personality of Nils Flyg, words are spreading that this is the proof that the government is deceiving the Swedish populace, trying to portray Flyg as a God when he is really just a man that can also fall ill."
swe.91.a:0 "Hold a Rally to prove that Flyg is just fine!"
swe.91.b:0 "Time to switch to damage control!"

swe.92.t:0 "The Rally Is Unsuccessful"
swe.92.d:0 "The rally we organised to prove the health of our eternal general secretary has not been able to end the doubts; in fact, the situation has worsened as a result because while the speech started relatively smooth, it was easy to observe that the General Secretary was not well from the very beginning and as the speech continued a clear fatigue overcame the General Secretary. It made one journalist even feel bold enough to want to write that Nils Flyg's life has been shortened by three months by this event. Naturally, this counterrevolutionary scum has swiftly been taken care of."
swe.92.a:0 "I tell you, he is in good health!"

swe.93.t:0 "A Hotel Room has been Requisitioned"
swe.93.d:0 "As the condition of our General Secretary slowly deteriorates, he has become unable to make the daily travel from villa Tomtebo, the home of Flyg he acquired in 1924. As it is important for his duties as General Secretary that he is able to convene with congress and other officials of the Swedish state, he has requisitioned a hotel room close to the Stockholm castle, where the assembly convenes and he has his office. Reportedly he is distressed by the fact that he will for the time being live in a hotel room."
swe.93.a:0 "It's for the good of the country..."

swe.94.t:0 "The Motion Linderot"
swe.94.d:0 "Since the totalist seizure of power, the Swedish congress had become a mere rubberstamping institution for General Secretary Flyg, with little in the way of upsets. The congress was filled with committed totalists, except for about ~30% of the delegates, who were not removed to retain the pretense of democracy and had rallied around Nils Flyg's former associate Karl Kilbom and basically unsuccessfully vote against almost every proposal, with every proposal getting the exact same amount of seats in favour and against since the consolidation of SP control.\n\nThis morning, this atmosphere of political apathy was suddenly crushed: Sven Linderot, the leader of a faction within the SP in favour of greater internationalism and a lesser (European) nationalist doctrine with the party, suddenly pitched a motion to establish a 'Politiska Byrån' - political bureau - to take over the General Secretary's duties on behalf of congress as long as his condition will not allow him to properly exercise said duties. This was swiftly condemned by Flyg loyalists, headed by Arvid Olsson, yet the Kilbommare, witnessing this split in their nemesis, capitalised and supported the motion. For the first time since 1937, a motion against the will of the Flyggists passed."
swe.94.a:0 "How dare they!"

swe.95.t:0 "The Appointment of the 'Politiska Byrån'"
swe.95.d:0 "Following the passing of the Linderot Motion through congress, congress had to elect the delegates that would become members of the bureau. Unsurprisingly, Linderot had pitched his own list with himself as the chairman of the bureau and loyalists for the rest, which would essentially give him all power Flyg previously possessed. The Kilbommare did not cave to that however, and moved to present their own alternative list of syndicalist democracy proponents headed by Kilbom himself. Olsson and the Flyggists were wary of being left the opposition incapable of stopping the motion again, and resolved it would be better to help one of the two sides to the majority they require to take the bureau - hopefully the side that would be the least capable of removing Flyg from power."
swe.95.a:0 "Support Linderot - at least he is Totalist!"
swe.95.b:0 "Support Kilbom - at least he didn't betray us!"

swe.96.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Orders Flyg Be Moved Home!"
swe.96.d:0 "With his hold over the Political Bureau of his own creation, Sven Linderot was given de-facto in control over the country. The first act of the bureau is to have Flyg be moved back to Tomtebo. According to the bureau, this is so the General Secretary can rest, but most consider the real underlying reason is to render Flyg politically pacified. After all, without his hotelroom Flyg can't easily get to the halls of power in a good condition and thus it will be significantly easier for Linderot and his companions to control the country and Flyg's omnipresent supporters. Unsurprisingly, the General Secretary resisted with all the power he had, but the police officers 'to protect him' were relentless."
swe.96.a:0 "It is for your own good, Nisse!"

swe.97.t:0 "The Political Bureau Gathers for the Next Move!"
swe.97.d:0 "With the General Secretary out of the picture, the control of the Political Bureau is unlimited. Now a choice lies before Linderot: either he could announce Flyg's resignation now while Flyg is incapable to react and in poor health, or he could hold his horses, ruling the country for the foreseeable future, taking the gamble that Flyg will not recover and possibly go after him in the future for what he just did."
swe.97.a:0 "Announce Flyg's resignation!"
swe.97.b:0 "Let us remain just where we are!"

swe.98.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.98.d:0 "With Nils Flyg 'resigned' Linderot's own ambitions have been exposed. The Flyggists and mixed totalists, now firmly aware of what Linderot is trying to do and that Flyg's resignation wasn't his own decision, pitch comrade Flyg and exclaim that they will never support 'the rat' Sven Linderot for General Secretary, saying they'll put in even Kilbom into that office before Linderot. The Kilbommare opposition meanwhile, seek to do exactly that, but also among them it is clear, that by the guise of 'better the devil you know' and the consideration that Flyg is in poor shape, they are inclined to support Flyg. Coming in as a dark horse candidate for the position of General Secratary is Sven Olov Lindholm, a hardline Charter Toalist and supporter of General Secretary Flyg; who has often come into conflict with more mainstream Syndicalists. While some decry him as a pseudo reactionary, he appears to have a significant bout of sway considering Kilbom's craven moderatism and Flyg's poor health. It seems Linderot has overplayed his hand; he has lost the race before it even began and knowing that either side won't be soft on him for his attempted powergrab, his supporters are bailing out left and right. The question is however, which side will cave to the other first?"
swe.98.a:0 "Flyg is reelected in the third round!"
swe.98.c:0 "Lindholm is elected in the third round!"
swe.98.b:0 "Kilbom is elected in the third round!"

swe.99.t:0 "The Purge of the Linderot Faction!"
swe.99.d:0 "With the removal of Flyg, the Political Bureau was automatically dissolved too as it was a kind of regency for the General Secretary. As such, Linderot and his loyalists had been planning to invoke the articles included in their motion to reestablish the political bureau. However, these plans were cut short when the authorities arrived at Linderot's doorstep and arrested him on the suspicion of reactionary sympathies. In a show trial the same day he was with hastily convicted to thirty years of hard labour and sent on his way to a prison complex in the north of Sweden specifically designated for enemies of the regime. He was not seen again in Stockholm.\n\nSeveral other staunch Linderot loyalists have been put into custody too. The power of Linderot and his internationalist totalists has been broken."
swe.99.a:0 "Good Riddance!"

swe.100.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Dissolves Congress!"
swe.100.d:0 "With Kilbom in control of the bureau that takes care of the duties of the most important office of the country, the bureau has decreed that the political barriers imposed by General Secretary Flyg earlier are to be removed and had the congress dissolve. In a month's time all delegates of the congress shall face a free election, with no political barriers holding you back from partaking. It is obvious that the Kilbommare are out on getting a congress hostile to totalist rule to commence a recall vote on General Secretary Flyg, to then restore democracy."
swe.100.a:0 "Time to start campaigning!"

swe.101.t:0 "Recall Vote on Nils Flyg"
swe.101.d:0 "After vigorous campaigning, free elections have been held and changed the composition of congress. As such, we are now pitching a recall vote to try and remove Nils Flyg from power, which will let us in turn elect a new General Secretary and safeguard revolutionary democracy in Sweden."
swe.101.a:0 "The recall vote passes, Nils Flyg is removed!"
swe.101.b:0 "The recall vote fails, Flyg remains in power."

swe.102.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.102.d:0 "The syndicalist-democratically aligned congress removed Nils Flyg from his office as General Secretary, which probably helps him more than it hurts him, considering his fragile health. Congress must now elect a new General Secretary however. Most agree that Karl Kilbom - now the saviour of Swedish revolutionary democracy - should become the new General Secretary on behalf of the SSV. The SAC did nominate Frans Severin however and members from both parties have formed an alliance in the hopes of abolishing the office of General Secretary altogether, considering that it only leads to tyranny."
swe.102.a:0 "Kilbom is elected General Secretary."
swe.102.b:0 "Severin is elected General Secretary."
swe.102.c:0 "Congress abolishes the office."

His wife was rushed to his hotelroom as fast as possible but when she arrived it had already been too late - the General Secretary passed away alone. While she lost her husband, Sweden lost its leader, and chaos overtakes congress as a vacuum in power has suddenly spawned out of this as a result. This vacuum was soon filled however: with Linderot and Kilbom having been outplayed earlier and the SP faction reunited, it seems clear who shall become the new chairman of the SP."

Flyg had spent his last months grumbling and raging against Sven Linderot, who as chairman of a 'Political Bureau' had him moved home 'to rest' as a result of which he could do nothing against the chairman's de-facto exercise of power that technically belonged to him. For better or for worse though, he was at home at his Tomtebo villa; had he remained in the hotel room that he had been assigned at first, he might well have died alone, without his wife and closest supporters by his side.\n\nCongress was swift in declaring Sven Linderot the second Chairman of Sweden, who had discretely been consolidating his power while ruling in Flyg's place.

swe.122.d:0 "A patrol has been inspecting the ruins of a house in Stockholm in the aftermath of the battle, when they found the remains of a Swedish officer in a most unusual uniform as well as several of his presumptive guards. Upon further inspection, it has been deduced that this officer was in fact once the nefarious Swedish dictator Archibald Douglas. Clearly he and his guards had remained trapped in the building for a fairly long while, as the bodies are showing their first signs of disintegration. Regardless, the confirmation of the death of their dictator must come hard on the Swedes."
swe.122.a:0 "A Tyrant has fallen!"

swe.123.t:0 "The Riksledare Is dead!"
swe.123.d:0 "We have received confirmation that the body of the Riksledare, who fought among his troops in the battle of Stockholm and who had been considered to be missing since several days, has been found by the enemy. He has had honours bestowed upon himself in absentia on the orders of Archibald Douglas, Douglas's friend and former superior who has been declared the new Riksledare as per the orders of Douglas."
swe.123.a:0 "The Riksledare is dead. Long live the Riksledare!"

swe.124.t:0 "The Riksledare Is dead"
swe.124.d:0 "The great guide of our nation, Riksledare Archibald Douglas, has passed away peacefully in his villa. Of course, all of Sweden will now enter into a week of sorrow, but while respects are being paid, his power is immediately contested. Douglas was quite open in his desire of being succeeded by his friend, air commander, sport shooter and supporter of a strong military, but his ascent of the role of leadership is being contested by ideological extremists within the SRNS who instead desire Martin Ekström as the new Riksledare, as well as elements who are weary of Gyllenkrok's personality. Namely, he has been observed being aggressive, rude, sarcastic and almost abusive to his subordinates. Of course the totalitarian regime left by Douglas has many more 'radical' supporters, who wish to see the state transformed from a mere military junta into a more solidly legionarist state; this contingency is headed by former veterinarian Birger Furugård, who heads a radical arm of the SRNS's paramilitary. Others wish to follow arch-Conservative, traditionalist, corporatist, and Maurrassian figure Elmo Lindholm, a renowned philosipher and Latin scholar who heads the nationalist Sveriges Nationalella Förbund party. Then there are some within the army who have seen enough of the totalitarian tactics employed by the SRNS and who are plotting to install Helge Jung as a moderate candidate."

swe.127.t:0 "Discontinuation of the Allmänna Säkerhetstjänsten"
swe.127.d:0 "With the war ending and peace returning to Sweden, the special secret service structure that was established also has run its course. As a result of the desire by politicians to cut the costs, this project will now be ended and the agencies will once again run autonomously."
swe.127.a:0 "This shall help us maintain our budget."

swe.128.t:0 "Rocketry Accident"
swe.128.d:0 "One of our rockets that was being tested in our bid to extend our knowledge surrounding rocketry has been in somewhat of an accident: the trajectory of the rocket, which was supposed to drop into the baltic sea to be recollected by us, had been miscalculated. As a result of this, the rocket has only crashed almost 200km north of its original planned target. Needless to say, local authorities are all over it already."

swe.129.t:0 "The Bäckebo Bomb"
swe.129.d:0 "A German missile has crashed in the Swedish woods near Bäckebo, part of one Robert Gustavsson's land, where it left a detonation crater that is five meters wide. Our military has already arrived and taken possession of the wreckage, and it is being transported to Stockholm as we speak to be examined."
swe.129.a:0 "Finders, keepers!"

 swe.130.t: "Gustaf V of Sweden Abdicates the Throne"
 swe.130.d: "In a press release in front of Stockholm Palace today, His Highness King Gustaf V shocked the world by stating he has abdicated the throne of Sweden, dissolving over 115 years of rule by the House of Bernadotte. His Highness is quoted as saying "The elected representatives of the Swedish people have found it necessary to request my abdication. This is not a decision I take lightly, but I will not oppose the will of the people." The Swedish royal family has been granted permission to maintain residency in the country, but must forfeit all royal titles. Members of the royal family including Gustaf's own son and grandson have chosen to flee the country rather than give up their titles. The ruling SAP has in the kings’ stead appointed their leader, Per Albin Hansson as President of the new Swedish Republic. The future of Sweden seems uncertain."
 swe.130.a: "The northern lights dim further."

 swe.131.t: "Swedish Army Declares Martial Law"
 swe.131.d: "In the aftermath of the reformation of Sweden into a socialist republic under the SAP-SSV coalition and the abolishment of the monarchy, General Oscar Nygren and the Swedish Armed Forces under the cover of night swiftly occupied Stockholm this morning, declaring Martial Law across the city. Military Police battalions have been ordered to arrest all socialist politicians related to the Hansson cabinet, as the National Security Forces have mobilised to secure any pockets of socialist resistance. While there have been reports of some bloodshed, it seems the coup has been relatively unopposed. One of General Nygren's first decisions at the helm of the Swedish state was to reinstate the Royal families titles, as well as invite back Gustaf Adolf, grandson of Gustaf V. While Sweden might once again be stable, it remains to be seen what their future holds."
 swe.131.a: "One way or another, order returns to Sweden."

swe_syncon.1.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee Assembly - Governmental Status"
swe_syncon.1.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has been assembled for its first session. Tensions are high as all three parties are vying for power in this new, strange political climate. Membership numbers for all parties are exploding, although Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) is the largest one by far. \n\nFrom his podium, Karl Kilbom of the SSV advocates that in the new Sweden, we (the state) look after everyone who needs it, without prying into the affairs of common citizenry. Nils Flyg of Socialistiska partiet (SP) claims that citizenry police needs to be established, to 'safeguard the revolution' while Albert Jensen of Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation (SAC) claims that every commune should look after their own." 
swe_syncon.1.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."

swe_syncon.2.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee Assembly - Economic System"
swe_syncon.2.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has assembled for a second time. The initial belief that seizing power in Sweden would unify the left has now completely waned. Reforming the economy of Sweden is the topic of the day, and speaking sharply for the SSV is Anna Johansson Visborg, claiming that strong unions and government influence will secure worker's rights. \n\nThe SP representative, Sven Linderot, claims that all workers should be gathered into a single, large union, and a the focus should be on massive state funded projects. Finally, Gustav Sjöström of the Syndicalists proposes the idea of commune based economy, where every region should strive to be self-sufficient."

swe_syncon.3.d:0 "For a third time the Revolutionary Committee holds session. With the current military disloyal to the red cause, the various leaders are discussing radical army reforms. Zeth Höglund of the SSV wants to reintegrate the Swedish army through education of staff and soldiers, where soldiers council's should elect officers out of their own ranks. \n\nGustav Johansson from SP claims that a strong army needs a strong central command, and that a National School for politically indoctrinated officers must be the backbone of our new army. The SAC representative, Nisse Lätt, believes armies should be trained and used for local, defensive deployment and only summoned elsewhere for extreme situations."

swe_syncon.4.d:0 "Our fourth session has been assembled. Outside the doors, Sweden lies in chaos, but inside we are assured we can sort it out. Our new society must build upon equality, a strong union and compassion for your fellow man, or so claims Östen Unden of SSV. \n\nHilding Hagberg from SP believes that we must put faith in a strong man to lead us all into an era where Sweden isn't just a strong nation, it's a great nation, rivaled by none and feared by all! The most passionate of all speakers however is the SAC representative Elise Ottosen Jensen, who envisions her dream of a society free of oppression, where one cares and shares with your local community."

swe_flavor.1.d:0 "Karin Boye, a prominent author, poet and female rights activist coloured by socialism has just released her latest piece. It's a novel called För Lite (Too Little or For Little) and centres around the themes of working to achieve your dreams or make your ends meet, and your responsibility to yourself as a person and to your family and friends. Boye is very popular and her new novel is a success."
swe_flavor.1.a:0 "I shall have to read it sometime."

swe_flavor.2.t:0 "Greta Garbo Stars in Camille."
swe_flavor.2.d:0 "Greta Garbo stars in the American produced movie Camille, a romantic drama. Greta Garbo is one of the biggest names in the movie industry, both in Sweden and in the world. The movie is rather harmless and holds a high quality production but some of the more conservative elements of our society are most upset... Her clothes are a bit revealing! They are calling for a censorship. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.2.a:0 "That outfit is too revealing! Censor it!"
swe_flavor.2.b:0 "It seems most entertaining. Send me a ticket!"

swe_flavor.3.t:0 "Five Year Commemoration of Ådalen"
swe_flavor.3.d:0 "In May 1931 a large march of strikers marched towards barracks for blacklegs who were working at local factories. The police had called in the military for support and before the day was over, the riots had ended in five strikers being killed by military fire. Ever since then yearly marches are held in memory of the dead workers among socialists, although conservatives claim that the workers were armed and attacked them first. The strikes of this year are unusually large. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.3.a:0 "Let them. They'll tire eventually."
swe_flavor.3.b:0 "Wasn't once enough? Send in the military!"

swe_flavor.4.t:0 "Final Sentence of the Sala-gang"
swe_flavor.4.d:0 "In the summer of last year a gang led by a name called Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman (a name he added himself, presumably because it is an anagram for Manhunter) was arrested for a murder. Soon the investigations reached nationwide front news as it turned out that the gang was not only guilty of murders dating all the way back to 1931, but also because it was ran more or less like an occult group and went under the nickname 'The Magic circle''. \n\nThe leader and the conspirators were sentenced in court the other day, most of them to life in prison but the leader was considered so mentally ill that he was sentenced to closed psychiatric care. Many people are outraged, and would have wanted to see Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman put away for good!"
swe_flavor.4.a:0 "We must respect the court's decision. Closed care it is."
swe_flavor.4.b:0 "Arrange for this monster to be relocated to a prison."

swe_flavor.5.t:0 "Manhunter on the Loose!"
swe_flavor.5.d:0 "Two years ago, Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman was sentenced to closed psychiatric care but our politicians overruled the decisions and put him in prison. In prison his mental state reportedly worsened, and just after Christmas last year he broke out and murdered a taxi driver and stole his car. The police lacks any good leads and fear he may have gone underground or even left the country..."
swe_flavor.5.a:0 "What have I done?!"

swe_flavor.6.t:0 "Major Hotel Strike!"
swe_flavor.6.d:0 "After failed negotiations with the unions a major hotel strike has caused a hotel lockout in Sweden. From Stockholm to Göteborg to Malmö you won't find a single hotel which is properly staffed. Striking down at the protestors violently could disperse them... or set off a backlash, while negotiation with them could make the red parties grow. We could just ignore them, but that might hurt our economy, at least for a while."
swe_flavor.6.a:0 "Let's replay Ådalen, send in the military!"
swe_flavor.6.b:0 "Let's negotiate with them."
swe_flavor.6.c:0 "Ignore them. Surely it will stop?"

swe_flavor.7.t:0 "City Massacre"
swe_flavor.7.d:0 "Our brave soldiers nobly defended the government directives when the strikers, reds and other rabble started throwing bottles and rocks. The turmoil and riots lasted for the entire day and over a dozen workers have been killed before the protestors were fully cleared. For some reason a couple of journalists managed to leak pictures of bleeding civilians in the streets of Göteborg, and now Sweden is in shock!"
swe_flavor.7.a:0 "If they had only stayed home..."

swe_flavor.8.t:0 "The Hotel Strike Ends"
swe_flavor.8.d:0 "For several months the strike has been going on, hurting our economy and our prestige, but eventually we tired them out. The strikes have ended and things are back to normal... For now."
swe_flavor.8.a:0 "Thank Goodness!"

swe_flavor.9.t:0 "Funeral of Gösta Ekman"
swe_flavor.9.d:0 "The legend of Gösta Ekman, Sweden's most popular actor and theatre-director, passed away at age 47 after a period of sickness. In the last eleven years, Ekman was part of no less than twenty three productions. Following his funeral train in the streets of Stockholm, over 100 000 (!) people, roughly a fifth of the city, watched the coffin pass and mourned the end of a Swedish legend."
swe_flavor.9.a:0 "We all mourn today."

swe_flavor.10.t:0 "Astrid Kindstrand on the Radio"
swe_flavor.10.d:0 "A few days ago, Astrid Kindstrand read the news on Sweden's Radio, the national radio channel, the first woman to do so in Swedish history. In the following days, hundreds of angry phonecalls and letters reached the state and various newspapers across the country to complain that a woman is allowed to read state news."
swe_flavor.10.a:0 "Don't they have anything else to be upset about?"

swe_flavor.11.t:0 "Landstormens Lilla Lotta"
swe_flavor.11.d:0 "A new Swedish comedy movie has hit the theatres and reached a surprising amount of popularity. It plays a bit with the traditional story of Romeo and Julia but also throws things of order upside down, such as making the bank director a private when he joins the army and the groundskeeper a commander. Everyone fools around and no one takes their military training seriously while falling in love with one of the pretty women of the Lotta-corps."
swe_flavor.11.a:0 "Oh ho ho! I love me some jolly movies!"
swe_flavor.11.b:0 "How dare they mock the Swedish military like this?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.12.t:0 "Garbo Skrattar - Ninotchka!"
swe_flavor.12.d:0 "Garbo laughs - That is how the movie is marketed all across the world, as the Swedish, beautiful mega-star Greta Garbo does her first attempt at a comedy movie. The movie centres around Garbo in the role of Ninotchka, an ice-cold syndicalist who finds love and abandons her political ideas to move to a capitalist society. Even though it is tounge-in-cheek, and makes fun of the capitalist society too, it is clear that it mocks all forms of syndicalism."
swe_flavor.12.a:0 "She is so beautiful! Get me a ticket!"
swe_flavor.12.b:0 "How dare they mock the glorious Swedish revolution?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.13.t:0 "Kallocain Released"
swe_flavor.13.d:0 "Kallocain is a novel written by the ever busy Karin Boye. It takes place in a dystopian, fictive nation where critizising the state is strictly illegal and the state controls every single part of your life. It reflects on men and women, on class issues and the conflicts that arise from these issues. It is, ultimately, a depressing read. It takes brutal stabs at any totalitarian regimes, left or right."
swe_flavor.13.a:0 "A fascinating and disturbing read!"
swe_flavor.13.b:0 "How dare she mock the strong, glorious state? Censor it!"

swe_flavor.14.t:0 "Death of Karin Boye"
swe_flavor.14.d:0 "Karin Boye was found lifeless on a hill north of Alingsås after she had, seemingly intentionally, overdosed on sleeping pills. The poet and author was known for her emotional instability, in particular over the last few months. Even more so perhaps since one of the women she loved, Anita Nathorst, was dying of cancer. Her sexuality was a public secret, and the pressure of it all might have been too much."
swe_flavor.14.a:0 "Visst gör det ont när knopparna brister..."

swe_flavor.15.t:0 "IKEA Founded"
swe_flavor.15.d:0 "The other day a seventeen-year-old lad named Ingvar Kamprad founded a small company for selling everything from pencils and fishing tools, to stockings and belts. It is run from his parent's private farm as a mail order company and appearently he will personally bike out to your home and deliver the goods to your front door."
swe_flavor.15.a:0 "Seems like an ambitious young man."

swe_flavor.16.t:0 "New Malmö Theatre Opens"

swe_flavor.16.a:0 "Get me a ticket!"

swe_flavor.17.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Passes Away"
swe_flavor.17.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many as a father of the Nation. The former admiral reigned as prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nIt is said that Bagge rarely took any decisions without asking for advice from the senior Lindman, but no longer. A public funeral will be held and attended by the King and other people of fine birth."

swe_flavor.18.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Is Dead"
swe_flavor.18.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many to be a tyrant who did everything he could to kill democracy and socialism in it's cradle. He reigned as a prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nWhen our revolutionary government proclaimed Sweden to be a republic, he was among the first to flee abroad and he died, alone and unwanted, in a flat in Berlin."
swe_flavor.18.a:0 "A great tyrant is gone"

swe_flavor.19.t:0 "Valkyriorna Formed"
swe_flavor.19.d:0 "With war coming to the shores of Sweden, the stunt-pilot Elsa Andersson, known for her daring parachuting in the twenties, has requested to form a women's only air brigade. The project has adopted the name 'Valkyriorna', after the winged women of ancient norse mythology who oversaw which warriors would be slain on the battlefield. Women have gathered in droves to sign up, wanting the chance to fight for Sweden, but the idea is not undisputed. Many feel that women in the army is not fitting with a modern civilised nation."

### Decisions ###
SWE_fix_black_monday_category:0 "Response to Black Monday"
SWE_fix_black_monday_category_desc:0 "The Swedish economy is tightly connected to the German one, and as such, the economic downturn in Berlin soon found its way to the purses of the average Swede. As such, the prime minister has appointed a Crisis Commission under the minister of finance to prevent Sweden from ailing away under the effects. With unemployment rising and tax returns shrinking this will surely be a daunting task, however.\n\nFree Budget: [swedishBudgetAmount] kronor.\nInflation: [?swe_var_inflation|%-0].\nUnemployment: [?swe_var_unemployment|%R0].\nRelated debt: [swedishDebtAmount] kronor."
SWE_drop_gold_standard:0 "Drop the Gold Standard"
SWE_drop_gold_standard_desc:0 "The Swedish national bank, the Riksbank, is held to convert Swedish Kronor into gold at standardised value by law. We can suspend the standard however, as per the instruments of government in times of financial ruin, which will make Swedish goods easier to sell internationally, but also cause inflation."
SWE_print_extra_money:0 "Print extra money"
SWE_print_extra_money_desc:0 "We can order the Riksbank to print us extra money to spend. However, this may cause the value of the Kronor to drop."
SWE_take_a_loan:0 "Borrow 2 million Kronor"
SWE_take_a_loan_desc:0 "We can take a loan of 2 million Kronor to add to our budget, but this can not be done indefinitely."
SWE_repay_a_loan:0 "Repay 2 million Kronor"
SWE_repay_a_loan_desc:0 "We can repay 2 million Kronor from our budget, so we won't have to pay interest over it anymore."
SWE_cut_funding_on_military:0 "Cut Military Funding"
SWE_cut_funding_on_military_desc:0 "We can save quite a bit of money by cutting the funding of the military. The world is becoming ever less stable however, so such a decision should not be taken lightly. In addition, the Swedish conservatives are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_raise_taxes:0 "Raise Taxes"
SWE_raise_taxes_desc:0 "We can bring in some extra money to spend on countering Black Monday by raising some extra taxes. This may stifle the market even further however, and the Swedish liberals are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_cut_welfare:0 "Cut Welfare Funding"
SWE_cut_welfare_desc:0 "We can save quite a bit of money by cutting on welfare expenditure. Such a move may deny those that have been hit the hardest by the crisis a much-needed lifeline, and, unsurprisingly, the Swedish Social Democrats are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_public_work_program:0 "Start a Public Works Program"
SWE_public_work_program_desc:0 "The most straightforward way to combat unemployment is to kickstart large public works projects the unemployed can participate in. They can then use the money they earn with this to take care of their families. As an added bonus, the money they spend will enter the economy and help it recover."
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports:0 "Subsidize Raw Resource Export"
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports_desc:0 "A large part of the Swedish economy relies on the export of raw resources such as iron ore and tungsten. By subsidizing these exports, we will find our fair amount of foreign currency flowing our way, which will aid our recovery significantly."
SWE_nationalize_company:0 "Nationalize a Major Company"
SWE_nationalize_company_desc:0 "Fact is that the goals of major companies are often aimed at making the most profit rather than providing as many people as possible with a living. To that end it might be worthwhile to nationalize one of these major companies and redirect it towards that goal. This will not be cheap, however."
SWE_implement_tariffs:0 "Implement Tariffs"
SWE_implement_tariffs_desc:0 "We can try protecting our own economy by implementing tariffs against the cheap goods that enter Sweden while bringing in some money as well. We are part of Mitteleuropa however, which is a free-trade area; as such, this is technically a violation of our international obligations."
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission:0 "Wrap up the Crisis Commission"
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission_desc:0 "The Crisis Commission was established in the 1936 Crisis Act to help Sweden combat the effects of Black Monday. Once the crisis is over and everything has been properly dealt with, we can wrap up the commission."
SWE_repay_leftovers:0 "Repay [?swe_var_debt|1] million Kronor"
SWE_repay_leftovers_desc:0 "We can repay the rest of our debt from our budget, so we won't have to pay interest over it anymore."
SWE_counter_inflation:0 "Increase the Riksbank Interest"
SWE_counter_inflation_desc:0 "Banks in Sweden take loans from the Riksbank. By increasing the interest over these loans, we can influence the money supply and lower our inflation once."

SWE_geopolitical_actions:0 "Geopolitical Actions"
swe_join_reichspakt:0 "Join the Reichspakt"
swe_join_reichspakt_desc:0 "With the dangers of syndicalism ever encroaching towards Swedish borders, it would be prudent to look to likeminded powers. The Kaiserreich is the champion of the status quo, and a fellow Germanic nation withstanding the tides of Latin anarchy. Let us stand together in battle!"
swe_join_internationale:0 "Join the Third Internationale"
swe_join_internationale_desc:0 "The dangers to the young revolutionary republic are many, with the fat kaiser viciously looking to end the worker's freedom in its neighbouring countries in its cradle. We should stand together with our Comrades in France and Britain against this menace!"
swe_leave_reichspakt:0 "Leave the Reichspakt"
swe_leave_reichspakt_desc:0 "We have come to the conclusion that the political climate that was in place when Sweden decided to enter into an alliance with the Germans is no more, and that the alliance is now hampering our goals more than it is aiding it."
swe_leave_internationale:0 "Leave the Third Internationale"
swe_leave_internationale_desc:0 "In the recent past, the Internationale has unfortunately been moving into a direction that is incompatible with the Swedish doctrine of socialism of European origin that is spreading around the world. The sad truth is that the main worker's alliance is moving towards a dead end and Sweden will not follow it into the ravine."
swe_seize_aland:0 "Invade Åland"
swe_seize_aland_desc:0 "We tried to secure Åland at the end of the Weltkrieg when Finland and Russia's fate were still not clear. German pressure eventually forced us to retreat, despite our righteous mandate with over 80% of the archipelago's population wishing to join Sweden, and resolved the dispute in their Finnish puppet state's favour. An opportunity might arise to bring the islands into their rightful homeland once more, be that for strategic or nationalist reasons."
swe_subjugate_neighbours: "Subjugate [FROM.GetName]"
swe_subjugate_norway_desc: "The Norwegians have enjoyed their independence long enough. It is time for Sweden to reclaim its birthright as the country that dominates and shapes the Scandinavian geopolitical scene and a Norway that doesn't bend the knee to Stockholm does not constitute a proper part of the new Nordic order."
swe_subjugate_finland_desc: "Finland has historically been under Swedish dominion ever since the Northern Crusades in the 13th and 14th century, until we had to surrender it to the Russians in 1809. Now is time to strangle the decadent Finnish state that was born out of the poor Russian administration and restore the rightful order over the Finnish lands once more."
swe_operation_radde_danmark:0 "Operation Rädda Danmark"
swe_operation_radde_danmark_desc:0 "Denmark formed an alliance with the Germans against the syndicalists, a most probably fatal decision for the country: the German eagle has fallen and the torch and cog now rules Europe. As part of the debris of the German sphere, by all accounts it is expected that they will be destroyed by syndicalist forces soon. For Sweden, this situation is highly inconvenient as a syndicalist regime in Denmark could potentially allow a separate syndicalist invasion of our own homeland, and therefore our officers have made a plan: we invade Denmark first and depose the Danish government in favor of a regime friendly to us, thereby creating a buffer zone between us and the syndicalists of mainland Europe."

swe_establish_allmana_sakerhetstjansten:0 "Establish Allmänna Säkerhetstjänsten"
swe_establish_allmana_sakerhetstjansten_desc:0 "With war once again coming to our shores, it has been proposed that we bring our security and intelligence services under one single command, under the General Security Service. We shall put the experience police officer Eric Hallgren in charge of this secret operation to maintain the integrity of our national security."


getFlygsRefuge_Norway:0 "the large villa he had been assigned in Norway"
getFlygsRefuge_France:0 "a beautiful house in France"
getFlygsRefuge_Britain:0 "a moisty farmstead in Britain"
getFlygsRefuge_Mexico:0 "a modest home in Mexico"

SWE_political_chaos_idea:0 "Political Stagnation"
SWE_political_chaos_idea_desc:0 "Since her neutrality after the First Weltkrieg, Sweden's political scene remained relatively stable, remaining as a constitutional monarchy in the North. Alas with the resignation of the previous Prime Minister and the mounting economic stagnation, little is done within the Riksdag. Either side that puts forward a bill is swiftly rejected by the opposing side, alongside increasing tensions globally, the upcoming election is seen as a new hope for the future of Sweden."

SWE_german_reach_1:0 "German Economic Influence"
SWE_german_reach_1_desc:0 "While she remained neutral in the First Weltkrieg, Sweden has enjoyed an array of trade deals with the German Empire, seen as the economic bastion of central Europe. While this has strongly aided the Swedish economy it has not gone without its drawbacks, German industrialists and business now hold deep influence within the nation, able to influence the political scene to support both them and German interests."
SWE_conservative_army_idea_1:0 "Fractured Army Leadership"
SWE_conservative_army_idea_1_desc:0 "The Swedish army is operating in a fractured state, as factionalism and differing theories of modern warfare cause endless debate and outrage. The current head of the army Olof Thörnell frequently bickers with his younger rival and subordinate Helge Jung, and political radicalisation rises through the ranks as the threat of syndicalism looms large."
SWE_statare_idea:0 "Statare Workforce"
SWE_statare_idea_desc:0 "Roaming from farm to farm are the landless Statare, peasants devoid of both property and wealth who work on an annual basis on estates and farms. As a consequence from the increased grain imports from Ukraine and America, Swedish farms have transitioned into working primarily with animals, requiring a vast host of animalhandlers and stableboys. Statare are the lowest rung in society, forced to sleep alongside roads between contracts, and stuffed into barracks on larger estates. Paid half in cash and half in ‘stat’, meaning being paid in produce or leased land, there is zero ability for social advancement."

SWE_black_monday:0 "Black Monday's Midnight Sky"
SWE_black_monday_0_desc:0 "Years of hard work and economic planning has gone out the window, The economy is dead. Following the American crash just a few years ago, the Swedish economy found itself focused almost entirely on the German market, and with the subsequent collapse of the latter, everything has fallen apart. Salaries have been cut from all major businesses, layoffs are everpresent, social unrest is rising. In the cities local unions and political parties have created soup kitchens to help the recently impoverished, and on the countryside churches and their missions are filled with the destitute. The stage is set for absolute calamity." 
SWE_black_monday_0:0 "Black Monday's Dark Clouds"
SWE_black_monday_0_desc:0 "Things are bad, worse than bad. Following the decision by the government to step in and help steer the economy away from the abyss the stock market has recovered, but only in the smallest of margins. The shock of the crash is now spreading further down to the consumer, weeks if not months of salary cuts and layoffs harming smaller businesses too, creating a vicious circle of decline. Soup kitchens continue in operation, and wherever there’s a soup kitchen there’s a socialist agitator, preaching about a better world."
SWE_black_monday_1:0 "Black Monday's Grey Clouds"
SWE_black_monday_1_desc:0 "It has taken time and effort, but the ominous clouds are beginning to mellow out. Following the global economy recovering, conglomerates merging and companies restructuring, things are finally looking up, if just a bit. Less people visit soup kitchens than during the peak of the collapse, consumer spending is gradually increasing following major employers hiring once again, but things are still rough. The cities might be returning to pre-crash levels of activity sooner or later, but the villages, the small towns, are still suffering."
SWE_black_monday_2:0 "Black Monday's Clearing Clouds"
SWE_black_monday_2_desc:0 "The graphs are pointing upwards, the line goes up, things are improving… According to statisticians anyways. The villages are still destitute, the poor are angrier than ever, and while more factories operate than in the past several weeks they are oftentimes hampered by industrial action. Things are looking up, but things are tense. Perhaps the greatest news lately is that the massive state owned LKAB entity has resumed operations, mining is back on the menu, and minerals flow abroad once more."
SWE_black_monday_3:0 "Black Monday's Clear Skies"
SWE_black_monday_3_desc:0 "It is finally at an end, soon enough anyways. Following the factories resuming their operations properly, and with a growing need for natural resources, even the villages in the furthest reaches of Norrland and Dalsland thrive with activity once more. The tension remains, however. While the workers in the cities argue for better rights and oftentimes an end to the capitalist system as a whole, those in the forests and the fields argue about something vastly different. Indeed, what if this whole disaster happened because of godlessness and vice, rather than the fickle whims of mammon?" 	

SWE_cutting_the_army:0 "Cutting Military Expenditure"
SWE_cutting_the_army_desc:0 "In order to save the nation, the guarantor of the nation's security must face the metaphorical saw. While the current supreme commander Thörnell has given his support to the plan, the younger officers around Helge Jung protest profusely. After all, the last time the army was cut to the bone was shortly before the first weltkrieg…"
SWE_austerity_measures:0 "Further Austerity Measures"
SWE_austerity_measures_desc:0 "It is a tragic truth that the whims of capital affect those with the least influence over it. The poorest in Swedish society are rapidly becoming poorer as the government attempts to cut any spending possible, privatizing or straight up shutting down several of the last government's social programs in order to save the nation. While the government claims to one day restore the cut programs, the sheer severity of black monday means it is unlikely to happen anytime soon…"

SWE_removing_statare:0 "Removal of the Statare"
SWE_removing_statare_desc:0 "Following an agreement between both the Swedish Agricultural Workers' Union and the Forest- Landowners Association, the age of the Statare is finally coming to an end. Following a demand from the government as well as popular outrage, no farmworker or hired hand will ever be allowed payment not in hard currency, effectively spelling the end of the Statare plight. With peasants finally paid in cash, the transient nature of their existence is rapidly coming to an end, as they are finally able to own their own homes, buy their own food, and cultivate their own land."

SWE_statare_idea2:0 "Improved Statare"
SWE_statare_idea2_desc:0 "Nobody likes Statare in Swedish society besides landowners, but that doesn't change the fact that the Statare are needed. If the Statare were paid in hard currency the price of meat and other agricultural produce would shoot through the roof, and as such, the government has an idea on how to keep them around, while slashing homelessness and poverty in one fell swoop. Via the careful use of both agreement and contract, Statare can both be given a better standard of life on the myriad farms throughout the country, while still remaining dependent enough on the landowners to remain as cheap labour. Not only should Statare be smallholders of their own, growing their own crops and tending to their own cattle, they should still be workers for the larger estates. While some might claim that our grand scheme is borderline medieval by tying the poorest to larger estates, this is a solution that solves the Statare issue for a generation, without succumbing to radicalism or anti-market thought."

SWE_social_dem_pol1:0 "Constructing Folkhemmet"
SWE_social_dem_pol1_desc:0 "The stated goal of Per Albin Hansson since 1928, Folkhemmet is the idea of a kinder, fairer and prosperous Sweden. As per the name, Folkhemmet, or ‘the people’s home’, it envisions the idea of the Swedish government as one that protects the welfare of those within it, ensures healthcare and education, to create a more equal society. In order to achieve this society, first the groundwork must be laid, beginning with creating offices and staffing the civil service with as many hardworking individuals as possible. All around the country, state planners and politicians from all parties meet to plan the future of the country, a country that hopefully soon will be filled with hospitals, schools, and homes for all. Radical critics within his party and those in Paris-backed associations decry him as a traitor for collaborating with capital in his quest for social reform, but Per Albin intends to prove his opponents wrong. A greater society is possible, and reform need not come from the barrel of a gun."

SWE_social_dem_pol2:0 "Emerging Folkhemmet"
SWE_social_dem_pol2_desc:0 "Progress is made, but progress is slow. While the cities are feeling the full brunt of the new incentive to turn Swedish society more equal, with offices created, schools and hospitals opening on a quarterly basis, the countryside has proven more resistant to change. Fringe parties object to the idea of an equal society based on reform rather than revolution, and in the north of Sweden syndicalist politicians often block what they call ‘capitalist coercion’. In contrast, more rightwing members of the political scene accuse the entire project as one big socialist coup. Despite the opposition from the extremes, the center holds fast, with both the SAP and their opponents in the Riksdag remaining true in their vision. While the idea of a proper welfare state remains elusive, it is gradually becoming reality."

SWE_social_dem_pol3:0 "Folkhemmet"
SWE_social_dem_pol3_desc:0 "Not too long ago, the poorest in society believed that reform could only come via violence. Not long ago, syndicalist agitators roamed through soup kitchens preaching revolution, and in isolated clubs throughout the country officers schemed to save the country from the brink of chaos. Not long ago even Per Albin Hanssons quest to create a home for all was viewed as nothing but empty words, election rhetoric, and hot air. Today his sceptics, his critics, are all quiet. Through agreement and handshakes, through friendly meetings with both high society and trade unions, Per Albin Hansson has created Folkhemmet, a free and equal society for all, free from the ravages of the worst of capitalism, but also free from the worst excesses of revolutionary violence. Things are not perfect yet, there is still poverty and inequality, but as long as Sweden stays the course, maintains the programs focused on uplifting the poorest in society, it can act as a model for all."


SWE_social_dem_urban_effort:0 "Urbanisation Efforts"
SWE_social_dem_urban_effort_desc:0 "Swedish cities lack planning. Everyone in Sweden knows this. Not only does the roads go all over the place, the local city councils oftentimes have barely a clue on what to develop next. Indeed, in places like Stockholm and Gothenburg, there’s such a lack of housing that people live in shanties and huts, even forced into small summer houses not fit for habitation during winter. Something must be done, even more so since the continued exodus from the countryside has only increased following black monday. Since the free market has been lacking in its eagerness to solve this problem, the government is stepping in, buying land when needed and creating new development, both communal housing, and larger houses for larger families. An effort is also being placed on cooperating with renters associations, as well as urban landlords, and even the Swedish Church which is another major landowner. In time, Sweden will surely have sound housing for all."
SWE_social_patriot_idea:0 "Patriotic Party"
SWE_social_patriot_desc:0 "What is more patriotic than to love your country? What is more patriotic than to serve the nation, in time and during a crisis? This debate is raging throughout Swedish society, following a rift between the SAP and their opponents on the right. Claiming that the social democrats are not patriotic enough, perhaps even disparaging of their own country, the right has hurled the nation into a media frenzy based entirely on accusations and rhetoric alone. Per Albin Hansson however, does not intend to play along with these accusations. In a stormy speech in the Riksdag, Hansson pointed out that true patriotism comes from helping your fellow countryman, working for the common good of all in society, and building the country rather than selling it off to the highest bidder. Detailing his own life, Hansson compares himself with his opponents, claiming that he lives like a true Swede. He drinks with his friends, plays cards, engages in sports and drives a Plymoth Deluxe D6. By contrast, he points out how the leader of the opposition drives a Mercedes, dresses his wife in ermine furs from Vienna, and spends too much time in Switzerland. If anything, Hansson argues, the SAP is the real patriotic alternative in any election, for it is only by voting for him and his party that the nation is kept free from the vultures of foreign capital." 

SWE_health_care_idea:0 "Creating A National Healthcare System"
SWE_health_care_idea_desc:0 "Key to the concept of Folkhemmet is the idea of easy access to healthcare. Most towns tend to have at least a small private clinic, with larger cities housing one or more hospitals, but those places are often closed to the poorest in society. Those in the countryside, toiling away on large estates for often no payment whatsoever, are often plagued by a myriad of diseases and ills, things that could easily be dealt with if they had easy access to a doctor. Finally, the Riksdag has decided to intervene. With a few hospitals already built, and several more being planned, and with an entire generation of willing and eager doctors and nurses, healthcare will soon come to all. In the meantime, buses travel from village to village, carrying rural doctors until access to more proper facilities have been arranged. Bit by bit, Folkhemmet will be built."
SWE_health_care_idea2:0 "National Healthcare Insurance"
SWE_health_care_idea2_desc:0 "Key to easy access to healthcare is insurance, and the government is here to help. Although various communities and unions throughout the country already have their own healthcare insurance systems set up, Sweden does not have a binding national healthcare insurance. Until now. Following plenty of debate and argument in the Riksdag, a scheme has been developed to ensure that every man woman and child in the country becomes covered by the same safety net. For a little bit more money each month, as part of taxes, healthcare has become the obligatory right of all citizens. Not only does it make getting your medicine cheaper, but hopefully now nobody will become destitute just from seeking aid."

SWE_unity_cabinet_lamp_desc:0 "Following the outbreak of hostilities abroad, the different political parties in the Riksdag have chosen to close ranks and form a government of national unity, until such a point as the nation is deemed safe from external threats. While the current prime minister will remain in his position, the cabinet has been shuffled. The party leaders from the different parties in the unity cabinet have all been given positions in the new government, all in an effort to ensure stability and safety. That said, the parties on the fringes have been excluded from the arrangement, like syndicalists and the more extreme right wing."

## Lindholm Tot ideas ## 

SWE_lindholm1:0 "Beginning the National Revolution"
SWE_lindholm1_desc:0 "Sweden needs rejuvenation. Far too many leaders have betrayed the Swedish worker and the Swedish soul, and now the soul is tattered, broken, helpless. But the soul will live again. By highlighting historical successes and comparing them to the national revolution currently unfolding, Lindholm aims to make the acts of industrial nationalization and political fanaticism be seen as following in the footsteps of the great and the unsullied."

SWE_lindholm2:0 "Furthering the National Revolution"
SWE_lindholm2_desc:0 "What does a national revolution entail? Lindholm knows, his party knows, and soon enough the nation will too. Nothing less than a full rejuvenation of the whole national spirit and mindset will suffice, and nothing less than complete state authority will be accepted. In the cities the national revolution has finally arrived in its full brunt, while in the rural countryside pockets of resistance remain, clustered around mutinous soldiers, rogue priests, and peasants deluded by promises of reaction."

SWE_lindholm3:0 "True National Revolution"
SWE_lindholm3_desc:0 "Lindholm has won, which means the party has won, which means the people have won. The national revolution now covers all the country, from the smallest island to the greatest peak, in estates once owned by delirious fatcats a new generation of party members are educated, and in schools throughout the country a portrait of Lindholm looms large. The state is absolute, not just in industry and finance, but also in the heart of every right minded Swede."

SWE_red_resistance_lind:0 "Syndicalist Resistance"
SWE_red_resistance_lind_desc:0 "Syndicalism has its uses… But mainline Paris-style syndicalism has run out of favour for Lindholm. Although previously tolerated as a nuisance, like a tick on the national body, lately the syndicalists have risen up in force in rural industries, struggling against the new plans of the Swedish state. Though these agitators and bandits might think they can overthrow the government, Lindholm knows that they only remain due to the kindness of Lindholm's movement. A single order would wipe them all out."

SWE_red_new_guard:0 "Refined Red Guard"
SWE_red_new_guard_desc:0 "The Red Guard was once a borderline seditious element in the new Swedish society, but now they’ve been refined and sculpted into a true solid and loyal force of the party. No longer electing their leaders like during the heyday of the revolution, the Red Guard has proper educated officers, and a carolean iron-like belief in their leader. The members of the Red Guard, calling themselves Rödgardister, are proud and committed to the goals of the national revolution."

SWE_false_reds:0 "False Socialists"
SWE_false_reds_desc:0 "The party must face an uncomfortable fact: There are impostors among us. Social democrats and pseudo-capitalist unionists have infiltrated the movement and the nation as a whole, and must be rooted out by hook or by crook. Already the Red Guard rushes through the streets on lorries and makeshift armored cars chasing down names on lists, hoping to purge the government of this rot before it spreads."

SWE_new_statare_red:0 "Red-Tinted Statare"
SWE_new_statare_red_desc:0 "The statare of old are no more, and the nation rejoices. After case by case land reform and by no longer allowing workers and peasants to be paid in anything but government currency, the statare of old have effectively vanished. Instead, toiling on the farms and fields are former counterrevolutionaries, forced to work in the countryside for the duration of their sentences. While critics might call this just a statare system with socialist slogans, even these convicts are treated better and housed better than the statare of yesteryear."

SWE_nat_pop_allies:0 "Cross Aisle Alliance"
SWE_nat_pop_allies_desc:0 "Lindholm might be a revolutionary leader, but he is also a pragmatic one. Across the aisle, in secretive clubs and associations are the remnants of an old movement, one that is not so different from Lindholm’s own. Although some of these elements are xenophobic to a ridiculous degree and borderline agents against the state, Lindholm has decided to at least invite them into an alliance of convenience. After all, even the rogue Birger Furugård can agree that Lindholm values the nation above all."

SWE_lindholm_police_tot:0 "All Knowing Party"
SWE_lindholm_police_tot_desc:0 "What the party needs to know, it knows. Information the party lacks is not information it needs. Just like Hugin and Munin of old mythology, the party apparatus of  today collects all the information it can find, storing it for safekeeping, trying its best to know and understand as much about both the party itself as well as rogue elements within society at large. Informers lurk in every town and city, wiretapping is frequent, and subversive elements are kept to a minimum."

SWE_lindholm_church_destroyed:0 "Nation Without Faith"
SWE_lindholm_church_destroyed_desc:0 "Sven Olov Lindholm did not agree with Marx on many things, but Marx’s idea that religion was a reactionary element is something Lindholm is completely in agreement with. Through a concerted campaign of intimidation and coercion Sweden will become an atheist state in more than just name. Let the socialists on the continent bicker on how to handle the question of religion, for Sweden already has the answer. Any church of sufficient age and aesthetic value will be transformed into community hubs, while plain wooden churches and temples of smaller denominations will be destroyed."

SWE_lindholm_church_transformed:0 "Crismon Sermons"
SWE_lindholm_church_transformed_desc:0 "Lindholm is not a religious man, but he is pragmatic. Since the Swedish church is so closely knit with the Swedish state apparatus as a whole, rather than destroy it outright Lindholm has decided to subvert it. Reactionary priests have been thrown out and new ideologically committed priests have been brought into the fold, and in churches all throughout the country, the faithful listen to sermons about Lindholm, God and Jesus… In that order."

## Military coup ideas ##

SWE_red_resistance_mil:0 "Leftist Resistance"
SWE_red_resistance_mil_desc:0 "When the army stepped in to save the nation from the brink of disaster, it was with the understanding that the left - long gone rogue - would be pacified. At first only targeting the more extreme tendencies on the left, the army soon turned its attention to leftist unions and associations, attempting to wipe the reds from the map. Socialists of all stripes and colours, from syndicalists to charter totalists, remain active in pockets throughout the country, fighting the new regime."

SWE_unending_martial_law:0 "Indefinite Martial Law"
SWE_unending_martial_law_desc:0 "The army is in charge, and it will be for the foreseeable future. Soldiers alongside police guard the streets, newspapers hostile to the new state of affairs have been closed or had its editors arrested, and striking is viewed as a seditious act."

SWE_army_symbol:0 "Military Symbolism"
SWE_army_symbol_desc:0 "An active effort is being undertaken by the army to ingratiate itself with the population at large. From posters to radio shows, movies and pamphlets, the army aims to become a core part of the Swedish soul, to become just as Swedish as the idea of the flag itself. Comparing the brave leaders of the coup with heroes like Engelbrekt Engelbrektsson and Gustav Vasa, the army clearly wants the people to accept the new government and the coup as necessary for the nation."

SWE_radical_paramilitary_support:0 "Radical Nationalist Paramilitary Support"
SWE_radical_paramilitary_support_desc:0 "Though the army is firmly in charge of the nation, it receives aid from the white guard of the Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti. Led by Archibald Douglas and devoted anticommunard Martin Ekström, this small but fanatical party and its combat unit claim their legacy from the Finnish civil war, where Ekström commanded a battalion and later a regiment against the reds. Disciplined but prone to violent excess, the combat unit is mostly deployed in the rural countryside against isolated bands of socialist agitators."


## Jung Ideas ##

SWE_pataut1:0 "Beginning The Military's Vision"
SWE_pataut1_desc:0 "Although Jung launched a coup against the government, he never actually had much of a plan on how to structure the government post attempt. Currently the different government offices struggle to function, with former government aligned members of the civil service either having fled abroad or gone underground, and as such the army has to fill in the gaps. Positions once held by government ministers have mostly been staffed with ideologically loyal politicians or officers, and although there’s no grand plan to follow, army routine and discipline means that - once Jung and his fellow conspirators know what course to take - changes will be implemented swiftly."

SWE_pataut2:0 "Furthering The Military's Vision"
SWE_pataut2_desc:0 "As the army continues to spread its tendrils throughout Swedish society,  Jung and his fellow companions have solidified a view on what their Sweden should become. Strong, independent and bending no knee to anyone, Jung visions a country where the army and the people are one in the same, where the young view conscription into and participation in the army as a duty. Industry will be harnessed for the Swedish state, profit will be secondary to the health of the nation, and the family unit protected from un-Swedish ideas."

SWE_pataut3:0 "Sweden's Military With A State"
SWE_pataut3_desc:0 "Like Sweden during the great power era, the Swedish army is an integral part of the state, at this point practically even being the state. Civilian politicians still exist, but they are vetted before entering into any position in government, the civil service is being rebuilt with a distinctly more patriotic slant than before, and the police is in essence an arm of the army. If Karl XII looked down upon us from heaven, he’d surely be proud."

SWE_jungs_vision:0 "Jung's Defensive Alignment"
SWE_jungs_vision_desc:0 "An alliance is only good as long as it guarantees the independence of the parties within it, or so Jung believes anyways. Shunning the idea of elaborate invasions abroad or colonial ventures, Jung believes that Sweden must find or directly create an alliance of likeminded states that aim to remain independent in an age of strife. With the Germans, French and Russians all scheming to destroy one another, it is up to the Swedish lion to somehow maneuver around the metaphorical savannah of international diplomacy."

SWE_alllied_companies:0 "Military Aligned Companies"
SWE_alllied_companies_desc:0 "AB Landsverk, Volvo, SAAB, Götaverken and many other companies have come to terms with the new government. Following coercion and handshakes, drinks and threats, Swedish industry stand behind both the government and the Army. Not unlike the agreement made between the government in Berlin and Krupp, the Swedish state finally has suppliers it can rely on."

SWE_pataut_natpop:0 "Nationalist Military Dictatorship"
SWE_pataut_natpop_desc:0 "The Army is more than just a force for waging wars or defending the country, it is in fact a spiritual agent in the lives of its people. The Swedish Army is for the Swedes and other brotherly peoples, and it is via this connection that the Swedish right has a special type of love for its armed forces. Like Georg Carl von Döbeln who fought in Finland against the odds, the leaders of the country are viewed as heroic nationalists worthy of respect."

####Focuses####

SWE_rikstag_restructuring:0 "The Riksdag's Rising Stagnation"
SWE_rikstag_restructuring_desc:0 "Arvid Lindman, the conservative titan that-according to AV and the Swedish right as a whole-saved Sweden from the grips of godless Marxism retired two years ago, putting his protege Gösta Bagge as new prime minister. Struggling to chart his own course out from under the shadow of Arvid Lindman, as well as dealing with the fallout of the American crash, Gösta Bagge is broadly unpopular, having been unable to put his case to the Swedish people. As Sweden comes closer to the next election, Bagge and AV have embarked on a reelection campaign, doing their best to make the professor of economics Bagge seem like a man of the people."

SWE_further_military_spending:0 "Prioritising Rearmament"
SWE_further_military_spending_desc:0 "The Germans are rearming. The Syndicalists are rearming. The Russians might as well be rearming. Even friendly neighbours Finland Norway and Denmark are, to varying degrees, rearming. As such the government has taken the decision to rearm as well, not wanting to be caught off guard like the government of Karl Staaff back in 1914. "

SWE_eyes_on_the_left:0 "Suspicion Towards the Left"
SWE_eyes_on_the_left_desc:0 "AV, as well as their former leader Arvid Lindman, has never trusted the SAP. Hjalmar Branting, the first socialist prime minister, never publicly refuted both republicanism nor socialization, not to mention that the current leader, Hansson, is himself a dedicated republican. Taking lessons from the elections of 24’ and 32’, AV will attempt to smear their opponents as useful idiots on behalf of socialism, syndicalism, and godless totalism."

SWE_farmer_reachout:0 "Indulging Folkpartiet's Needs"
SWE_farmer_reachout_desc:0 "AV’s coalition with the Folkpartiet has, for the most part, remained steady. Still clinging to the legacy of Karl Staaff the liberals have put their faith in working with the right to maintain their influence. Although liberals in the Riksdag are today few and far between, they are still instrumental in maintaining AV’s control over the government, and as such, Bagge intends to indulge them. By loosening restrictions on foreign media and by starting discussions over permitting the production of Coca Cola in the country, currently outlawed due to the usage of phosphoric acid, the government hopes to cement ties with their liberal allies."
SWE_budget_debates:0 "Discord Over Budget"
SWE_budget_debates_desc:0 "Every year the government must present its budget to the Riksdag, an event that makes it one of the most important political events in the country. If the Riksdag votes against the proposal, they can then present an alternative, an alternative the government must follow-even if the government absolutely loathes it. Due to the AV having a strong position in the two chambers of the Riksdag, Gösta Bagge believes this year's budget will simply be rubber stamped and put into effect… Unless something disastrous was to happen."

SWE_german_business_linger:0 "German Business Influence"
SWE_german_business_linger_desc:0 "The leviathan that is the German economy has done wonders for Sweden, aiding in massive industrialisation projects throughout Sweden, however this has not gone without consequence. Many industries in Sweden answer to Berlin, considering Germany's opinion over Sweden’s own government. Alongside this, many in Sweden are afraid of being drawn close to Germany, believing that such a move would guarantee Sweden’s involvement in any future wars Germany is likely to find herself in. Soon the government will be faced with a tough choice regarding this behemoth."

SWE_neutrality_maintained_for_now:0 "Policy of Neutrality Maintained"
SWE_neutrality_maintained_for_now_desc:0 "Sweden has been neutral in foreign affairs since the end of the Napoleonic Wars, when Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, Karl XIV Johan, fought against his former superior to save Europe from armageddon. Following this grand conflagration however, Sweden has been neutral often out of circumstance rather than pure government policy, something changed in 1914. Swedish politicians, not to mention Gustaf V, understood early on that the growing world war would become a horrible catastrophe, and wisely issued a statement early on declaring Swedish neutrality, followed shortly by the three joint monarchs of Scandinavia declaring it together. Similarly, in the Swedish political climate, the liberals of Karl Staaff, conservatives of Arvid Lindman and socialists of Hjalmar Branting all three agreed that Swedish neutrality was of utmost importance, the Riksdag becoming united. As the elections come closer, Gösta Bagge will attempt to ensure Swedish foreign policy remains neutral, meeting with the king, the opposition, and the media for this purpose."

SWE_dark_monday_cloud:0 "Black Monday Strikes"
SWE_dark_monday_cloud_desc:0 "After the crash of the German economy, the ripples of her problems have finally hit Sweden, completely crippling the economy. In an instant, the economic policies of Lindman and Bagge have come to naught, as businesses close and unions protest in the streets. If Allmänna Valmansförbundet is to survive the coming elections, it will need to act fast. Taking inspiration from attempts in America and even dipping his toes in Keynesian economics, Gösta Bagge must save the country to save himself."

SWE_devalue_the_krona:0 "Devalue the Krona"
SWE_devalue_the_krona_desc:0 "Key to Swedish economic growth lies in two factors, namely that Swedish goods must be cheaper and better than anything sold abroad. By devaluating the currency to incentivize investment, and by selling produce and products cheaper abroad as a result, the government hopes to save the economy by sacrificing the currency."

SWE_protecting_agriculture:0 "Defending the Heartlands Supply"
SWE_protecting_agriculture_desc:0 "Sweden is one of the few countries in modern Europe that can actually sustain most of its population with its own produce, but this is not an ironclad fact. By creating incentives and by handing out government support to farmers throughout the nation, Sweden hopes to survive Black Monday with its agricultural output intact. Bondeförbundet look upon these ideas favorably, and will aid the government in its implementation through the Riksdag."

SWE_minor_welfare_imp:0 "Moderate Social Reforms"
SWE_minor_welfare_imp_desc:0 "Swedish conservatism is not as terrified of welfare policies as those in the rest of the west, and in order to defeat the SAP in the ballot box, the government has decided to force through some modest and moderate social reforms. The government will issue grants to local councils to provide free food for schoolchildren, single mothers will receive more support, and unemployed workers will be registered and provided temporary jobs in government employ."
SWE_companies_crisis:0 "Minor Business Subsidies"
SWE_companies_crisis_desc:0 "Gösta Bagge is critical of welfare policies, and believes that by supporting some of our primary industries, those in fishing and manufacturing, we can hope to create more jobs. This should in turn reduce unemployment and increase support for the Electoral league."
SWE_cutting_armed_forces:0 "Limiting Military Expenditure"
SWE_cutting_armed_forces_desc:0 "A new bill has passed in the Riksdag, supported by the SAP and Bondeförbundet, cutting government expenditure on non-essential military equipment. Reducing costs to the army has upset the general staff and the “Jung Junta”, however with unemployment up to 25%, we can spare no quarter."
SWE_more_austerity_measures:0 "Raising Taxes, Lowering Costs"
SWE_more_austerity_measures_desc:0 "The AV has proposed and passed a bill in which many forms of taxes across Sweden will be increased, while annoying the population in the short term, it is believed it will reduce costs and after a short time allow for the lowering of taxes once more."
SWE_final_hurdle:0 "The Final Hurdle?"
SWE_final_hurdle_desc:0 "Bagge’s cabinet has not had it easy. First dealing with the aftermath of Arvid Lindman's resignation back in 34’, then struggling to formulate economic policy in the throes of Black Monday, Gösta Bagge has spent the last two years doing little but reacting, rather than being proactive as he had first desired. As the election comes ever closer, as debates rage in the Riksdag between leftists centrists and rightists, Bagge will finally know if the electorate desire politics, or those of his opponents. Will the AV’s response to Black Monday have been enough to win over the population? Or will the SAP under Hansson and his folkhemmet idea win the day? Or perhaps more worryingly, what if the SSV somehow take advantage of social unrest and force their way into power?"

SWE_black_monday_woes:0 "Woes from Black Monday"
SWE_black_monday_woes_desc:0 "While the former conservative government was rather successful in their initial handling of black monday, its economic depression is still rather prevalent in the nation.

SWE_reaching_out_to_soc_lib:0 "Crops with the Bondeförbundet?"
SWE_reaching_out_to_soc_lib_desc:0 "While our coalition with the AV has allowed us to win the election, their heavy handed approach to market protectionism and corporatism has hindered our advances on liberalisation of the economy. To the centre-left sits the Farmer’s League, a party devoted to uplifting the farmer’s amongst Sweden, alongside approaching the economy in a social liberal stance. Many of their economic views align nicely with our own, the only points of contention being that on national values. We now have a chance to gain their support, or to remain with our conservative allies."
SWE_rule_of_law:0 "Enforce The Rule of Law"
SWE_rule_of_law_desc:0 "With the rable rousers in the radical left and the malignant militancy in the far right, it has been shown that these groups have a direct disregard for the rule of law. We shall bring down the full might of the legal system against these dissidents."

SWE_united_morals_under_crown:0 "The Crown's Symbol of Conservatism"
SWE_united_morals_under_crown_desc:0 "The King of Sweden, a symbol of our ancestors and lineage, is a unifying symbol amongst those in Sweden. Only the most rabid radicals dare to oppose its grace and benefits it has given the nation, as the main conservative party in Sweden we must remind the population of this fact."
SWE_support_from_army:0 "Right from the Army"
SWE_support_from_army_desc:0 "It is no secret that the Army of Sweden holds a significantly strong view towards rightist views, with some even aligning with rabid nationalists. In this, we can gain potential allies but assuring them of a continued traditional and conservative government for their benefit."
SWE_red_scary:0 "Syndicalist Scare"
SWE_red_scary_desc:0 "Syndicalism is a scourge on the Earth, a devilish ideology that only hopes to destroy where it can, even slipping into moderate groups like with Hansson's social democrats. We must work on a public campaign against these groups."
SWE_monarchist_bulwark:0 "Timeless Traditions of the Monarch"
SWE_monarchist_bulwark_desc:0 "The monarchy, the unifying tradition of Sweden, has been here since the nation's first inception. We shall express our undying support for the Crown, while abasing political opponents as enemies of what truly unites us."

SWE_funding_the_farmers:0 "Further the Rural Support Base"
SWE_funding_the_farmers_desc:0 "For a long time, the Farmer’s party and other leftists have enjoyed support from rural small farmers by promising them increased benefits and government aid.

SWE_spotless_welfare:0 "Limited Welfare"
SWE_spotless_welfare_desc:0 "We shall implement welfare, similar to that proposed by the Social Democrats. However, as they propose, the ability to scam and cheat the system would run rampant, as such we shall design a system with strict eligibility and time constraints on welfare benefits."
SWE_spotless_welfare_desc:0 "Welfare carries the fear of creating a class of people who lounge about while receiving compensation, as such our policy of welfare shall be tightly regulated. Enforcing those who are on it to comply with standards, like actively seeking for a job or even military membership, to avoid an overbearing amount of government spending."

Achieving a landslide victory in the Riksdag, allowing them to avoid creating a coalition with any radical groups, Hansson and his party now finally have the chance to implement their dream of a true People’s Home."

SWE_scourge_black_monday:0 "Breaking Germany's Mistake"
SWE_scourge_black_monday_desc:0 "The economic scourge that came from Black Monday has but one main culprit, Germany and her kaiser. The nation that had run rampant on foolish expenditure with its victory in the Weltkrieg and conquest on fertile lands. Allowing any of her vestiges to enter the Swedish market has proven to be more of a curse than a blessing, now we must rectify this mistake and fix the economic woes that plague us."
SWE_unemployment_no_more:0 "Eliminating Unemployment"
SWE_unemployment_no_more_desc:0 "Unemployment runs rampant from the disaster of Black Monday, as such a solution must be made. Presented by Hansson, a plan to invest in government public works shall create jobs for those in the nation, while also furthering infrastructure development nationwide."

SWE_social_saviour:0 "Saviour of Sweden"
SWE_social_saviour_desc:0 "Hansson has done what many detractors deemed impossible, wrangling the Black Monday crisis into submission. Many of the former homeless are now homed, with large construction efforts across the nation directly underway due to the public works initiative.

SWE_distance_from_radicalism:0 "Ridicule the Radicals"
SWE_distance_from_radicalism_desc:0 "While cooperation with the SSV wasn’t ruled out prior to election, our victory has proven that we have no need for their radical ways. By denouncing their revolutionary actions and anti-monarchist stance, we can maintain a stable social democracy."

SWE_social_patriots:0 "Party of Patriots"
SWE_social_patriots_desc:0 "What is more patriotic than to love your country? What is more patriotic than to serve the nation, in time and during a crisis? This debate is raging throughout Swedish society, following a rift between the SAP and their opponents on the right. Claiming that the social democrats are not patriotic enough, perhaps even disparaging of their own country, the right has hurled the nation into a media frenzy based entirely on accusations and rhetoric alone. Per Albin Hansson however, does not intend to play along with these accusations. In a stormy speech in the Riksdag, Hansson pointed out that true patriotism comes from helping your fellow countryman, working for the common good of all in society, and building the country rather than selling it off to the highest bidder. Detailing his own life, Hansson compares himself with his opponents, claiming that he lives like a true Swede. He drinks with his friends, plays cards, engages in sports and drives a Plymoth Deluxe D6. By contrast, he points out how the leader of the opposition drives a Mercedes, dresses his wife in ermine furs from Vienna, and spends too much time in Switzerland. If anything, Hansson argues, the SAP is the real patriotic alternative in any election, for it is only by voting for him and his party that the nation is kept free from the vultures of foreign capital." 
SWE_social_king_trust:0 "Approval From The Crown"
SWE_social_king_trust_desc:0 "While the question of SSV coalition remained in the air before the last election, now we are certain that a Sweden without a monarch is no Sweden at all. We shall reaffirm our position towards the Monarch, arranging a private meeting between Hansson and Gustav V to guarantee stability and not another repeat of 1914."


SWE_welfare_done_right:0 "Introducing Folkhemmet"
SWE_welfare_done_right_desc:0 "Folkhemmet, also known as People’s Home, is the cornerstone of the Hanssons’ party’s policies. Based around a strong welfare system for the people, it hopes to achieve a system where everyone in Sweden has an equal chance at success, creating the egalitarian dream."

SWE_improving_statare_bros_desc:0 "Total abolishment of the Statare at this moment is still a long way away, however thanks to cooperation between the government and the Swedish Agricultural Workers' Union, a certain standard of living can be achieved. No longer will a landowner be able to evict a former employee without the evictee being granted a grace period, and no longer shall a landowner be able to lease animals to a farmworker that would then be returned once their yearly contract is up."
SWE_worker_protections:0 "Create the Home Guard"
SWE_worker_protections_desc:0 "The Home Guard shall act as an emergency defense force, incase of an invasion from any foe. Initially disorganised militias, by cementing them into a disciplined force located in nearly every town and village, we can hope to hold out against any invader."

SWE_nationalise_time:0 "Key Nationalisation"
SWE_nationalise_time_desc:0 "By nationalising key industrial sectors, specifically that of the transport and railway industries, we can hope to allow vast and effective transport from one side of Sweden to the other.

SWE_radical_united_front:0 "The Radical Coalition"
SWE_radical_united_front_desc:0 "While somewhat expected to see Hansson’s party win the election, it was not without its shortcomings. Unable to achieve a majority in the Riksdag, Hansson has announced a formal coalition with the SSV, in which they will have great control over policies decided by the coalition. While many see the moderate social democrats with pained expression having to endorse such radicals, the SSV and their syndicalist allies see this as the first tremendous step on the road to achieving a revolution in Sweden."
SWE_initial_nationalisation:0 "Funding Industrialization"
SWE_initial_nationalisation_desc:0 "To truly compete and level our nation with those around us, a large-scale industrialisation campaign must begin. Both aiding us in the production of goods, and improving the quality of living in Sweden."

SWE_enlarge_the_front_desc:0 "Our current support is still not enough, to bring about our vision of a Swedish republic, we must reach out to other groups with similar ideals. Those that align themselves with the syndicalists, the anarchists, and even the minor radicals under Flyg and Linderot. Such support we expand our reach and improve our support."

SWE_sail_seas_of_trade_desc:0 "In the 20th century, one cannot argue against the importance of trade, from basic goods, to consumer wants and military assets, international trade has become this century's cornerstone.

SWE_farming_mechanization:0 "Furthering Farm Mechanization"

SWE_stabilize_the_krona:0 "Stabilizing the Krona"
SWE_stabilize_the_krona_desc:0 "The Swedish Krona stands relatively weak amongst most European currencies, especially compared to the Mittleeuropean currency. Balancing the Krona against these will further decrease the woes of Black monday."

SWE_synthetic_research:0 "Synthetic Oil Experimentation"
SWE_synthetic_research_desc:0 "Our current oil reserves will not sustain our growing nation, both in the civilian sector and the military.

SWE_raise_red_guard_desc:0 "In a style not dissimilar to those in the Russian civil war, red guardsmen shall be raised.

Allowing us to exert control over areas dominated with monarchists and military loyalists."

SWE_control_black_monday:0 "Addressing Black Monday"
SWE_control_black_monday_desc:0 "With stability slowly coming back to Sweden, the issue of black monday still stands over the nation.

SWE_more_internationale_aid_desc:0 "Many reactionaries were in the military, and as such have control over most of the nations arms and weapons. While we have been successful in halting their advances thus far, we need more guns. Luckily, our valiant allies in the 3rd Internationale have promised to give us even more reinforcments."

SWE_military_confrontation:0 "Final Face of Reaction"
SWE_military_confrontation_desc:0 "What remains of the reactionary forces is little and sparse, but none can be allowed to corrupt our revolution.

SWE_sweden_industrial_congress:0 "Convene the All Workers' Riksdag"
SWE_sweden_industrial_congress_desc:0 "At long last, with the revolution secured and the majority of the reactionary threat eliminated, we can now turn to more internal matters. The old Riksdag building, damaged from some monarchist militia men who tried to defy our electoral victory, shall now serve its purpose once again. However, this next election will now be between the socialists of the SSV, the Syndicalists of the SAC and the fanatics in the mixed bag of the SNSP and SKP."


###Central Syndicalism Focuses###
SWE_central_syndicalist_victory:0 "Victory of the SAC's Centralist Wing"
SWE_central_syndicalist_victory_desc:0 "With the Industrial Riksdag over, the clear winner has been the Syndicalists of the SAC, having broken away from their Anarchist brethren and proposing a syndicalist state, free from Anarchist ideological purity tests, as well as rightist madness. In deep cooperation with the husk of the once great Landsorganisationen, Anarchists accuse the mainline SAC of betraying the revolution, something the leadership is more than eager to prove wrong."

SWE_remove_anarchists:0 "Syndicalism first, not Anarchism"
SWE_remove_anarchists_desc:0 "The Anarchist wing of the movement are not exactly pleased with having lost the battle for the soul of the country. Already, unions affiliated with Anarchist tendencies have taken to strike or are agitating in the streets, something that harms the cohesion of both the syndicalist movement, as well as the people as a whole. Arresting or harming them would be a death sentence for the SAC and the revolution as a whole, as at any moment the army could reveal its reactionary tendencies, and as such an olive branch must be extended to soothe the worries of the Anarchists, in order to achieve unity on the left."

SWE_collaborate_with_radicals:0 "National First, International Second"
SWE_collaborate_with_radicals_desc:0 "While Syndicalism itself is an international movement, stabilizing Sweden is the current goal. With the advent of the revolution still fresh and chaos still rampant in the streets, eyeing an international revolution right now would be suicidal. While open to help from abroad, and eager to cooperate in international agreements, first and foremost the fabric of the nation must be stitched together, from worker to farmer, Tornedalian to Scanian."

SWE_labor_led_union:0 "Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation"
SWE_labor_led_union_desc:0 "Initially formed in 1898, the SAC has finally achieved something deemed unthinkable just thirty years ago: taking actual power. Following the revolution the SAC has been hard at work to cooperate with and unify the different unions spread out throughout the country, inviting and supplanting unions once deemed too big to fail, and once hostile to the syndicalist vision of the SAC itself. In a series of grand congresses with full worker representation and a level of popular action never hitherto seen in Swedish politics, the people and workers of Sweden have voted for reform, for new laws and protections. Single mothers will now receive further support to remain in work, an extensive welfare system shall be built, and no longer will those rendered maimed or mutilated by hard graft be left on the streets to rot. Labour rules, and through labour will law be enacted."

SWE_destroy_monarchist_dudes:0 "Revolutionaries against Reaction"
SWE_destroy_monarchist_dudes_desc:0 "The conservatives and their liberal allies are slaves to capital, slaves to chauvinism, slaves to tradition, and as such the SAC has decided to once and for all crush their power. The liberation of the woman, the liberation of the poor, the liberation of the workers can only come via direct action and worker participation, and it is via this praxis that a campaign has been developed to spread the revolution out of the cities, into the countryside where the reactionaries hide. Taking lessons from France Britain and Spain, the SAC has formed columns of trucks plastered with revolutionary slogans, brimming with books and information, protected by armed guards. It is the belief and hope that through practical material action the message and goals of the revolution can enter the hearts of every man woman and child, and without totalist coercion."

SWE_federalize_the_provinces:0 "Permanent Union Representation"
SWE_federalize_the_provinces_desc:0 "No longer will petty politicians run the country in conjunction with capital, no longer will strange aristocrats scheme from country estates to harm democracy, and no longer will reactionaries hamper progress. Although the Anarchists would want to tear down society to build something new, the SAC knows that the best path forwards is via transformation, not destruction. Via the imposition of union representation in every level of politics, the SAC hopes to achieve a synthesis of both democracy and proper workers representation. Local councils will remain, but together with representatives from the local areas trade unions. Similarly, the Landsting will also have union representation from their respective region, and on a national level a grand board of unions will cooperate to further workers rights with the Riksdag."

SWE_party_syndicates:0 "A Union Based Nation"
SWE_party_syndicates_desc:0 "The goal of the SAC has always been worker representation and the transformation of society into one where the workers, freed from capitalist excess and statist violence, can truly live in freedom. An active policy of the SAC is to invite unions into the umbrella organisation, educating them on what Syndicalism is all about, and both guiding and taking input from this new member union. With the victory of the SAC in the last election, this will be sped up rapidly. Unions once affiliated with LO have been brought under the SAC roof, and measures are being taken to ensure that all workers, regardless of profession and former class, will be represented in their own respective unions."

SWE_history_of_action:0 "Syndicalism Is Action"
SWE_history_of_action_desc:0 "Syndicalism is dynamic. Syndicalism is alive. Syndicalism is action. It was through hard graft and determination that Syndicalism spread throughout the country and through the hearts of all sound workers, and it via hard graft and determination that a new nation will be built, a nation of action. Men and women, working together for the benefit of both family and community, represent this sense of action in mind as well as in body."

SWE_syndicate_industrialization:0 "A Swedish Three Year Plan"
SWE_syndicate_industrialization_desc:0 "Through planning and cooperation a new nation will be built. Following consultation with sound economists and trade unions, a three year plan has been put into motion, one that aims to transform Swedish industry into a new world standard. With an effort put into efficiency and safety, it is believed that the Swedish worker will become more skilled and capable than ever before, armed with good tools, working in clean and safe factories and workshops, eager to enjoy the fruits of his labour on his weekend and frequent holidays. Not only will new factories be built to make Sweden a more self sustainable nation, another ambitious goal is the idea of completely killing unemployment, the dream of a society where every man woman and child can enter the workforce and be freed by the sweat of their brow and the comradery of their fellow workers. "

SWE_new_red_worker:0 "New Swedish Worker"
SWE_new_red_worker_desc:0 "The Swedish worker of old was a pacified and terrorized man, assaulted by government overreach and bullied, enslaved, by capitalism and his cruel bosses. This man was weak, and barely dared to dream… No more. The Swedish worker of today is liberated, free in mind and action, educating himself on both machinery and philosophy when not working in a liberated workspace. Owning part of the factory he works in, he not only toils for his family at home, not only for the nation as a whole, but for himself also, where excess profit in industry is reinvested into the plant, rather than being stolen away to some cruel psychopathic top hat wearing hog on a private island. With clarity of purpose, the New Swedish Worker walks into the world a liberated man."

SWE_agrarian_unions:0 "Integration of Rural Unions"
SWE_agrarian_unions_desc:0 "Rural unions serve as an important pipeline to the woes of the rural worker, an often overlooked and forgotten member of society. While the SAC has historically been closer to the urban proletariat than the rural farmer or woodsman, this must end, and will end soon. Through closer cooperation and further integration of different associations and communities, workspaces and rural trades, the SAC can truly call itself the voice of all the people in Sweden."

SWE_against_foreign_reaction:0 "Establish The SBP"
SWE_against_foreign_reaction_desc:0 "Foreign reactionaries and national agitators still work at large to destabilize and topple the workers government, as such the establishment of the Statens Beväpnade Polis, or State’s Armed Police (SBP), shall be formed. A security agency working around the clock to protect Sweden and her people from invasive influences and detractors, it will nevertheless be closely monitored by the Riksdag to ensure it does not descend into totalist tyranny or police state intrigue. Democratized from the outset, entry into a position of the SBP requires one first be a policeman, and be an active participant in related union activities.

SWE_command_union_loyalty_desc:0 "Swedish bread must go to Swedish bellies first and foremost, likewise Swedish industry must cater to Swedish needs, but that does not mean Sweden is eschewing its international obligations. Unions from all across Scandinavia correspond with each other in Stockholm, meetings and congresses are held on an almost routine basis by thinkers from throughout the world, and Sweden has become more international than ever before. Due to the relatively bloodless revolution, Sweden has become very important in making Syndicalism more palatable to people living in oppressed countries, and Swedish aid associations are funded to help spread aid as well as Syndicalism abroad."

SWE_central_planning:0 "Necessary Bureaucracy"
SWE_central_planning_desc:0 "Bureaucracy is often hated by Anarchists and anyone with a basic pulse, but it is required for the effective governance of any country, let alone any state. While the Anarchists protest, the SAC has decided to embrace the bureaucracy of the Swedish government, as destroying it would simply throw a massive spanner in the works of Swedish industry. An attempt must be made to turn the grey blob of bureaucracy into a more vigorous and energetic part of the revolutionary government, but as it stands, despite the syndicalist goals of the revolution, for the foreseeable future the Riksdag and the different ministries of the government must remain in charge of affairs. If executive power was devolved too quickly, the syndicalist experiment would simply fall out of reach, as opportunists and reactionaries would seize control."

###Nils FLyg###

SWE_nils_flyg_in_power:0 "The Black Sheep Ascends"
SWE_nils_flyg_in_power_desc:0 "Long mocked by both the left and right, Nils Flyg now commands the state. The ideological outcast returns, not with compromise, but with a new order. Neither Marxist nor monarchist, his vision fuses national duty and syndicalist strength into one unyielding cause. With the legacy of Lenin and Mosley on his shoulders, Nils Flyg hopes to create a truly socialist state, without the failings of both political giants."

SWE_national_syndicalism_empower:0 "Define the National Syndicalist State"
SWE_national_syndicalism_empower_desc:0 "The reason why the Russian revolution failed, and the French and English revolutions succeeded, is in Nils Flyg’s opinion both due to a larger urban proletariat in relation to the population as a whole, and that the revolution was National, as opposed to International. Lenin, although a hero, failed in his historical task of bringing the red banner eastwards, as he was led astray by internationalist puppets, crypto-menshevik inner-party opposition, and conspiring minorities and as such, it was only natural that the bolshevik rising would fail, according to Nils Flyg. Indeed, in the bustling industrial heartland of Britain, Birmingham, true socialism is being built. Under the leadership of totalist thinker Oswald Mosley, Britain is marching into the future well armed and well fed, all without a pervasive ‘other’ in higher positions of power. Similarly, the Swedish revolution must be National, rather than International, and in order to do so a campaign has been put in motion to make the masses understand this fact. With a united population behind the party, behind the movement as a whole, Sweden will stand strong and independent. This is not international socialism. This is not liberal democracy. This is National Syndicalism. Class and nation are united. Labor serves the state. The people march with one purpose: strength."

SWE_remove_pink_parasites:0 "End of the Parasites"
SWE_remove_pink_parasites_desc:0 "Linderot, Lindholm Kilbom and Flyg once had a shared goal: Socialism. As time has gone on however, it has become abundantly clear to Nils Flyg and the party that Linderot, Lindholm and Kilbom have strayed from the path, not to mention already being in direct opposition. Linderot believes Flyg is taking the country down a dark path, Lindholm thinks Nils Flyg isn’t going far enough, Kilbom is distraught at the dismantling of the electoral system, and as such all three must be dealt with in their own ways. The likes of Kilbom, Lindholm and Linderot have no place in the new order. Kilbom, having wisely understood that Flyg would eventually move against him, has returned to Paris, desperately attempting to form a Swedish socialist party abroad. Linderot however is still in the country, and though he routinely shows up at the Riksdag, he’s otherwise gone dark. Furthermore, Lindholm no longer corresponds with Flyg as often as he once did, and while he cites service in the army as a reason, he’s likely also gearing up to overthrow Flyg the very moment he can. To save the country, to save the revolution, parasites hostile to the party must be destroyed, and first at home."

SWE_real_syndicalism:0 "Revolutionary Cohesion over Democratic Centralism"
SWE_real_syndicalism_desc:0 "Perhaps the best aspect of the red experiment in Russia was the principle of democratic centralism, though in the dire situation the country is facing currently, the party has been forced to put such principles on hold. Instead, while reactionaries scamper around in woods and play-pretend leftists protest, the country will be led according to what Flyg calls ‘Revolutionary Cohesion’, an obfuscating term meaning that all political decrees must come from him and him alone, without factional dispute. True syndicalism is built on unity and strength, not endless debate. The revolution requires discipline, clarity, and faith in leadership. Flyg speaks for the nation."

SWE_draft_penal_servitude:0 "Revolutionary Rehabiliatory Labour"
SWE_draft_penal_servitude_desc:0 "The revolution demands sacrifice. Just like the workers who struggled in the factories during the weltkrieg, and those who struggled during the myriad european revolutions, all Swedes must be willing to do the utmost for the nation and the revolution. Although the party plans to implement sweeping workers rights, the right of prisoners, counterrevolutionary agents and other parasites in the country will be forced to work for the nation. With the dual goals of increasing production and keeping reactionaries from fomenting rebellion in prison, the enemies of the revolution will be liberated by sweat and toil."

SWE_competitive_industrialisation:0 "Industrial Reform and Female Industrial Emancipation"
SWE_competitive_industrialisation_desc:0 "Industry is power. To survive, we must build an economy capable of competing with the great powers. If Lenin had been able to harness all the industrial power of Russia without menshevik opposition then the revolution would have succeeded, and by learning from this Flyg wishes to strengthen industrial output. Via the implementation of production quotas and rewards for exceeding them, via implementation of new technologies and the emancipation of women, production will surely skyrocket. With the implementation of a six hour work day, and daycares for children of workers, double or even triple shifts can be implemented, the sound of industry never ceasing. "

SWE_establish_secret_security:0 "Form the FNS"
SWE_establish_secret_security_desc:0 "Although the old capitalist police had their informants, and the army had their own security agency, with the revolution ongoing it has become abundantly clear that the party and the people need a new intelligence agency. Following a directive from Nils Flyg and the party, fellow party member Agaton Blom has been tasked with the creation of a new unified secret police, called the FNS, the Peoples National Security Police. The Folkets Nationella Säkerhetspolis will act as the eyes and ears of the regime, wiretapping and controlling opposition in the country. Already plans have been laid out where informants shall be placed throughout the country, and incentives to allow reactionaries to spy on their comrades rather than serve time as penal labour. Under direct command of the party, they will seek out subversion, disloyalty, and infiltration. Stability begins with vigilance."

SWE_cult_of_personality_flyg:0 "The Flyg Persona"
SWE_cult_of_personality_flyg_desc:0 "Lenin, Mussolini, Mosley. Three giants all united behind one goal, socialism, and all three devoted to the cause of national emancipation, according to Flyg, at any rate. What all three have in common beyond just their belief in socialism however, is that they all have, or are building, a cult of personality. Although sometimes formed artificially, a personality cult is just what Sweden needs, as outlined in the recent party communique. Thankfully, Nils Flyg has a rather colourful history, easy to spread to the masses. Nils Flyg saw first hand how Social Democracy betrayed the cause of socialism, was on the ground in Paris when the red banners conquered every street, and partook in the great achievements of Birmingham, where totalism was first properly implemented on a smaller scale. Just like Lenin Nils has travelled throughout Europe, met the most vital revolutionary thinkers of his time, and has himself suffered in service of socialism. His daughter Solveig died of tuberculosis in the twenties, directly contracted from a German socialist Flyg gave shelter, and he has put his own health on the line in service of the nation. Nils Flyg is not just a politician. He is the voice of the revolution. His image will be present in every government office and school, guiding words from him will be printed in every newspaper, his words will guide the future. The people must believe, and they must never doubt."

SWE_ideological_borderlands:0 "The Grey State"
SWE_ideological_borderlands_desc:0 "Nils Flyg and his party is not bound by traditional categories and labels. Following in the steps of Hegel and Marx, while learning from the present to discern the future, Nils Flyg’s ideology cannot be labelled as entirely socialist, entirely national, nor entirely militant. The party stands as a national syndicalist experiment, a totalist vanguard in an age of reaction and aristocratic liberalism, a beacon of dyed red light in a time of capitalist decay. It cannot be defined as simply socialist, syndicalist or nationalist. The party is the party, the ideology is the ideology, and perhaps the only thing that best summarises the movement Nils Flyg has created is that it dares to adapt. Let the communists and the internationalist parasites protest from Paris, for history will leave them behind.The party of today is forged from labor, loyalty, and national purpose. Ideology is not theory. It is action."

SWE_blow_up_reaction:0 "Purge Reactionary Remnants"
SWE_blow_up_reaction_desc:0 "The problems that once faced Lenin face Flyg. Although the urban centers have been under strict control, the rural countryside remains an annoyance, with white terror being an actual fact in the form of terrorist acts by former army units. While the FNS attempts to stamp out reaction in the cities, the rebuilt army must be put into practical use also, with former reactionary officers put to train the new dyed-red army. With experienced officers and politically motivated recruits, the second phase in the revolution begins, as trucks of soldiers venture out into pockets of reactionary resistance, saving the country one arrest at a time. Their time is over. They will be destroyed before they can shackle the people again."

SWE_newspaper_for_the_nation:0 "Voice of the New State"
SWE_newspaper_for_the_nation_desc:0 "Nils Flyg is not just a revolutionary, he is also a journalist. When not working, and when supposed to take breaks on national holidays, Flyg spends his free time writing articles, and reading other articles from aspiring journalists. Although not a friend of the capitalist journalist media of the past, Flyg knows the power of the press firsthand, and knows how it can influence people positively or negatively. Flyg’s favoured newspaper, The Folkets Dagblad Politiken, has been earmarked as Flyg’s preferred post-revolutionary newspaper, becoming the paper of the new government. Handed out for free and with articles printed within it also put in other papers throughout the country, it will shape the mind of the nation and carry the message of the Party to every citizen. Some might take offense to the idea of having a seemingly random article about the production quota of grain exceeding expectations in a sports magazine, but in time they will view it as prudent that even entertainment can be combined with information."

SWE_to_rule_as_king:0 "From Rubble comes Renewal"
SWE_to_rule_as_king_desc:0 "Following the revolution, Swedish industry completely collapsed. With worker action preventing production, and with factory owners abandoning the country, a profound brain drain has hit Swedish society also, as engineers architects and other specialists fled the country. This, naturally, must be rectified. In a new party directive Flyg has set out a series of goals for the country to achieve, ranging from attempting to bring some of the brain-drain back into the country, raising salaries for skilled labour, and completely refurbishing Swedish industry. Old machinery must be sold off and new machinery introduced, hazardous tools and lathes made more secure, and the proletariat must be made to understand political policy. With the proletariat united under the nation and party, the country will surely rise from the ashes, and a new generation of well educated party-loyal Swedes will take shape."

SWE_subdue_sami_natives:0 "One Nation, No Exceptions"
SWE_subdue_sami_natives_desc:0 "The worst policy attempt by Lenin and his successors was the idea that all groups in society had to be represented equally, an absurd notion according to Flyg. To Flyg, it is absurd that the Tatars and Bashkirs would have the same right to representation as the majority, as it only foments rebellion and counter-national thinking. Sweden has its own minorities. Most well known abroad are the Sami, but the largest is the Sweden Finns, not to mention the few Romani scattered throughout the country, as well as the jewish diaspora. To Flyg, it is ridiculous that all these peoples would be equally represented, or even have some kind of independent council of their own, even more so since to Flyg and Agaton Blom in particular, Swedish Jews for example are predisposed to liberal politics. In a new party directive it has been decided that from this point onwards all minorities in Sweden as to be viewed as Swedes, should have only the same rights and laws as any other Sweden, with certain permissions and unique conditions removed. Although both the liberal opposition and reactionaries protest this decision for various reasons, the party stands united. The era of regional identity and ethnic distinction is over. All who live in Sweden are Swedish. The Sami and other peripheral groups must be brought fully into the national identity, without compromise."

SWE_nation_of_patriots:0 "Ignite Patriotic Fervor"
SWE_nation_of_patriots_desc:0 "The problem with most socialist strains according to Flyg and Blom, is that they cling too closely to internationalist positions. While the party believes in peace among men and demilitarization during periods of tranquility, far too many parties throughout the world neglect their own population in service of some greater international goal, failing to see that the only realistic goal is the achievement of socialism at home, and that a global revolution can only be built from there. As such, the party has long had a very unique position in Swedish politics, and will continue to do so. Socialist but with a belief in Swedish independence and refusal to bow to any foreign power, Sweden only accepted aid from the internationale out of necessity, and while the party believes in the equality of all European peoples, Swedes take a natural position of higher importance. Agaton Blom in particular believes that by tying the party closer to a sense of patriotism it can bridge a gap in society, convince reactionaries and reluctant members of the proletariat that the party is a national party above all, and that it aims to achieve socialism only within the context of Swedish sentiment and culture. While Paris protests that Sweden is going down a dark path, and while Kilbom still wants to rally a socialist liberation force to stop the party, the party is rapidly becoming the soul of the nation. To work for the country is good, but to work for both the country and the revolution is better."

SWE_one_nation_one_party:0 "The end of Capitalist-Democratic Demagoguery"
SWE_one_nation_one_party_desc:0 "Some of the greatest crimes inflicted upon the Swedish mind was the idea of pluralist politics, of liberal capitalist-democratic demagoguery and of the class-collaborationist ‘Folkhemmet’ idea. Far too many workers have been distracted by empty words, parasitic sentiment of moderation having seeped into the very fabric of decent common society. This must come to an end. In a new party decree it has been decided that all parties in opposition to the current national revolution must be abolished and banned, their membership forcibly or otherwise pushed into the national party apparatus. Sweden has only room for one party, only needs one party, and it will only get one party."

SWE_nordic_engine_roar:0 "Awaken the Nordic Engine"
SWE_nordic_engine_roar_desc:0 "The party has been a gift to the country, and the country is busy repaying it in kind. Factories work 24/7, schoolchildren read articles by the party leadership and debate among themselves, women have been liberated so they can work the same hours as their male counterparts, and production output has risen to heights never seen before. As a new generation of Swedes enter industry, as new machines and tools build a better, purer, more equal society, as barracks have become centers of revolutionary vigilance and proletarian militancy, Sweden has finally awoken. Though some worry that the reignited spirit will lash out abroad, others are simply content, seeing a rising standard of living, an end to political squabble, and an end to reactionary terror. The party stands strong. The nation stands strong. The people stands strong."


###Linderot###

SWE_linderot_seizes_control:0 "Linderot's Communists Take the Helm"
SWE_linderot_seizes_control_desc:0 "The cause of Lenin never died, and thanks to Sven Linderot and the SKP, Lenin truly lives again. Following heated debate and political maneuvering within the Red Riksdag, the faction led by Sven Linderot has emerged dominant, promising a swift course correction in a more communist direction, inspired by the idealism of the early days of red Petrograd, but with the bureaucratic core of an experienced party. With advisors from the RKP supporting the communist cause, and with support from more moderate socialists throughout the country and abroad, Linderot is confident of success. His communists now take the reins of the revolution, promising discipline, ideological clarity, and a firm hand to guide the new Sweden, without the excess of Flyg."

SWE_skewer_remainding_sympathizers:0 "Skewer Remainding Sympathizers"
SWE_skewer_remainding_sympathizers_desc:0 "Flyg found himself too caught up in himself and his immediate followers, allowing for more seditious reactionary elements to remain at large in Sweden. No more, we shall bring the hammer of Socialist justice upon them, lest their influence fester and grow."

SWE_radical_opposition_removed:0 "Embolden Worker Involvement"
SWE_radical_opposition_removed_desc:0 "One of the crimes of Flyg was that he, despite his supposed syndicalist conversion, never truly trusted the worker, nor the unions. While the SKP does not entirely believe in the idea of syndicates and cooperatives, it is true that the party would win a lot of favour with disgruntled former SAC members if it at least entertained the notion. With the party in favour of uniting all remaining trade unions, former Flygist or not, into a larger umbrella organisation tied to the SKP as a whole, the party will stand as a beacon of true red liberation. The revolution must not be confined to the halls of power. The party will extend its hand to the factory floor, the fields, and the union halls, ensuring that the workers are not only represented, but actively shaping the future of Sweden's industrial future."

SWE_restructure_the_party:0 "Our Whites, Our Reds"
SWE_restructure_the_party_desc:0 "Nils Flyg used to be a communist, used to be a socialist, but fell for the trap of Mussolini-Mosleyite madness. Following the forced removal of Flyg from office most of his party membership moved over into the SKP, though more radical elements from his movement have taken to active armed resistance. Following a standoff at the former offices of Folkets Dagblad Politiken it has become painfully clear to the party that Flyg loyalists still skulk in the shadows, and must have the red glow of the revolution shone upon them. In an extraordinary session of the SKP the membership voted overwhelmingly along with Linderot, for the absolute and resolute destruction of Flygist, obstructionist and reactionary elements in society. With a purified Red Guard at the ready, the SKP will save the nation and revolution, one arrest at a time."

SWE_pluralism:0 "Popular Pluralist Politics"
SWE_pluralism_desc:0 "Unity does not mean uniformity. By inviting other leftist factions and radical socialist voices into the fold, the foundation of the workers' republic is strengthened. By continuing the policy of trade union integration, as well as keeping the party open to healthy debate but still following the practice of democratic centralism, the SKP will soon become seen as a liberating force in Swedish politics. It is the belief of Linderot that diversity within the revolutionary camp can serve as a source of strength, not division. On the opposite end however, Hugo Sillén privately warned against opening the party too much, believing that the movement is turning more and more pink by the day."

SWE_central_authority:0 "Dialogue, not Factionalism"
SWE_central_authority_desc:0 "The party is chafing, tearing at the seams, as a rising tendency of factionalism has started to take the halls by storm, but not for the reasons one might first assume. While former SAP and SAC members work within the party without much ideological deviation from the SKP’s core values, factionalism has emerged within the core party itself. Linderot, still intending to continue the path of socialist pluralism, has faced resistance from within the house itself, Hugo Sillén, his second in command. With the backing of the RPK, Sillén is attempting to force Linderot out of politics altogether, claiming that the leader of the Swedish revolution is in effect betraying it. Regardless, Linderot still remembers sending aid to Petrograd, still remembers fighting on the barricades, and if Sillén wants a fight for the soul of the party, he will get one."

SWE_discredit_moderates:0 "Denounce the SSV"
SWE_discredit_moderates_desc:0 "The SSV, having forced Linderot Sillén and other communists out of their movement, must surely be regretting the move by now. Karl Kilbom, now in Paris, has sent word that he’s very much in favour of the current course of the SKP and the Swedish revolution, and moderates aligned with him have become card carrying members of the party following the seizure of power. That said however, despite the former leader of SSV bending the knee, and Höglund dead in the ground, the SSV is still run by a motley crew of surprisingly diehard SKP rivals. The party must denounce the remaining party apparatus, must properly describe the obstructionist and oppositionist nature of their politics, and put the party in the grade by making it irrelevant."

SWE_against_red_terror:0 "Red Liberation, not Terror"
SWE_against_red_terror_desc:0 "By learning from Lenin the SKP can move forwards, in particular by learning about how the RKP fumbled the revolution in the east. According to the party, one of the reasons why the Russian revolution failed was because it ended up devouring itself, harming itself, locked too deeply in inner party machinations and needless revolutionary militancy. The revolution must not consume itself. The excesses of paranoia and unchecked violence risk turning the people against their liberators. Flyg has been secured, the reactionary terrorists on the countryside are becoming fewer and fewer by the day, and as such the state of emergency must come to an end."

SWE_controlling_the_economy:0 "An end to Syndicates"
SWE_controlling_the_economy_desc:0 "Another crime by Nils Flyg and his syndicalist allies, was the idea that workers in one factory felt a sense of belonging to their factory, rather than to the revolution as a whole. Society cannot be allowed to fracture in such a manner. If factories and industry throughout the country has rivalries with one another over production quotas and perceived uniqueness, then surely the revolution will descend into anarchy and chaos within half a decade. This cannot be allowed to stand. In a special party decree, all factories and industries within the entire country will become nationalized overnight, shares owned by individual workers made null and void, and instead higher salaries will be implemented across the board to alleviate some of the anger. It is time the proletariat understands that all workers own all industry, and that there’s no use of shares in a truly socialist system under the SKP. It is Swedish industry, not the industry of some syndicate or union. Through centralized planning and party oversight, all economic activity will be directed to meet the needs of the people, ensuring growth, equity, and industrial strength. Trade unions will remain, will continue to voice the concerns of the worker, and since all workers own all industries, the SKP argues that this is a wholly democratic and revolutionary act."

SWE_prepare_against_imperialism:0 "Against the Reactionary World"
SWE_prepare_against_imperialism_desc:0 "Just like Lenin, the party stands against international reaction. Across the border the workers hear knives being sharpened, rifles being loaded, and guns prepared for action. The Germans, so high up in the clouds thanks to their internationally renowned arrogance, want to kill the Swedish revolution in its cradle, wants to destroy what Sweden has achieved so far, wants to go against history. In an emergency party session it has been decided that the country must rearm rapidly for the troubles ahead, with an extraordinary push towards the full mobilization of the proletariat if need be. The old powers will not tolerate a socialist Sweden. Defensive measures, military readiness, and ideological vigilance will ensure that our revolution is never strangled by foreign hands, like they strangled Lenin and his project."

SWE_worker_plight:0 "Rights, Bread, Housing"
SWE_worker_plight_desc:0 "The revolution cannot rest, nor can it fight without succour. Via the implementation of new laws that cement the rights of the proletariat, as well as taking certain policies from across the board that would benefit the workers, the SKP will reward the people for their revolutionary devotion. With a six hour work day, the implementation of more holidays and state sponsored vacations, price regulation cutting costs while increasing quality of life across the board, it is astounding how much can be achieved without the snake of capitalism stealing profit and labour. Furthermore, despite the storms on the horizon, the party has decided to increase the production of new homes, hoping to one day house every single man woman and child, to kill homelessness forever. With these achievements, the party hopes to win the soul of the nation."

SWE_into_the_countryside:0 "Farmers, Peasants and Collectivization"
SWE_into_the_countryside_desc:0 "The countryside cannot remain a haven for old habits and feudal thinking. Collectivisation will bring rural production in line with socialist principles, empowering agricultural workers and feeding the nation fairly. Through land seizures from large events, a healthy farmer dynamic can be created, without the exploitation of statare or anyone else. Large farms will be broken up, smaller farms will be funded, and farms too unprofitable to be worked on by individual farmers will become collectivized, funded by the ministry of agriculture. Taking into consideration the unique Swedish position, farmers will mostly be left to their own devices, supported via mechanization policies, policies aiming to push the excess rural population into the cities. "

SWE_against_conmen:0 "Industrialisation Without Corruption"
SWE_against_conmen_desc:0 "Bureaucrats and opportunists must not be allowed to leech from the national industries. Oversight, audits, and swift justice will root out corruption and ensure every resource is directed toward collective prosperity, or at least that is what the SKP believes. Thanks to the remaining trade unions it should be easier than ever to keep the revolution pure, with both audits from above, and worker awareness as the base, ensuring bureaucratic ineptitude and opportunistic theft is rooted out quickly. As new industries are constructed and started on an almost daily basis, these measures are more than simply needed, but downright required for the revolution to remain pure."

SWE_light_of_communism:0 "The Red Lighthouse and Lenin"
SWE_light_of_communism_desc:0 "Where others have faltered, Sweden will rise. When Lenin died, and Sverdlov and Zinoviev failed to save the revolution, many communists broke rank, becoming syndicalists after being awed by the revolutions in Britain and France. Now however, through Swedish hands and by international support in true socialist spirit, the northern lights have been dyed red, a new beacon of true socialism having been lit. In a special event, Norra Bantorget has been renamed Lenintorget, with a large statue of the lost Russian revolution being unveiled in the place of the supposed mural to Hjalmar Branting. In a speech to leftist media both foreign and domestic, the party declared its intention to continue in the steps of Lenin, now and forever."

SWE_socialist_rule_of_law:0 "Strengthen Socialist Justice"
SWE_socialist_rule_of_law_desc:0 "Justice under socialism must serve the people, not protect privilege. The legal system must be structured under revolutionary principles, ensuring that laws reflect the needs of the masses and protect the gains of the revolution. No longer shall the proletariat be punished for not understanding or being aware of the esoteric laws of some long gone liberal intelligentsia, for all laws will be rationalized and easily understood. Laws deemed superfluous to the country will be removed, and laws once conspicuously left unwritten shall be created. No longer will people be arrested just for drinking in public spaces, and no longer can you end up in the drunk tank without even being drunk. Additionally, it will finally be illegal to attempt an escape from prison."

In a special party session it has been decided that, in the event of war, the working man is to be classified as a potential combatant in service of the nation, and may not leave his job or task unless given permission to do so."

##Lindholm##
SWE_national_revolution:0 "Folkets Revolution"
SWE_national_revolution_desc:0 "The greatest crime of socialism is that it puts a great effort on internationalism, of supporting foreign causes, of destroying the natural and national whole in pursuit of equality, at least according to Sven Olov Lindholm, party leader of the SSS. Having long skulked around in the periphery of Swedish politics, Lindholm and his crypto-totalist followers intend to rebuild the country, one brick and bullet at a time. Claiming to push a more Swede focused socialism, as opposed to the international socialism of his opponents, Lindholm calls himself a folksocialist."

SWE_organize_paramilitaries:0 "Forge a New Red Guard"
SWE_organize_paramilitaries_desc:0 "The militias raised by the government in defence of the revolution were, to say it lightly, profoundly incompetent. Often led by inept but charismatic trade unionists or anarchists, elected by politically aligned sycophants, these supposed Red Guards almost allowed the revolution to fail, and were prone to random acts of terror. No more. Lindholm, himself a soldier in the army prior to the revolution, has used his contacts and his expertise commanding small units to form the nucleus of what can finally truly be called a Red Guard. Calling themselves Rödgardister with full awareness of both political and relevant military matters, these new soldiers of the revolution will root out reaction, led by competent officers themselves often from a military background."

SWE_party_land:0 "A Return to the Land"
SWE_party_land_desc:0 "One of the greatest loves of Lindholm is nature, and mankind's destiny to wield it in their favour. In a new decree Lindholm and his party have made allemansrätten a true right to all Swedes, though not a right for subversive elements. Furthermore, large estates shall be broken up and handed out to farmers, both new and experienced, and the largest estates shall be turned into training centers for a whole new generation of farmers, eager to return to the soil from the capitalist day in the cities. Additionally, as part of this great plan to return Sweden to rural splendour, crimes against nature, such as abusing animals, harming plant life and otherwise despoiling the most beautiful country on earth shall be punished accordingly. No longer will a capitalist be able to dump poison in the wonderful lakes throughout the country, not unless he wants a bullet in the back, delivered by the Red Guard."

SWE_vast_industrialisation:0 "Industry as Destiny"
SWE_vast_industrialisation_desc:0 "Nils Flyg, called ‘den förbannade idioten’ by members of the SSS, nevertheless had a few good ideas in his perverted Marxist skull. Industry, both in mind spirit and material fact has always been a fundamental aspect of the Swedish character, and as such it must be brought to the fore. Unlike the internationalist socialists that insist on harming the world however, Lindholm knows that too much industry is a bad thing, that urban society is itself a corrupting influence on the soul, and as such wants to spread industry throughout the countryside, rather than let the grey halls of industry grow like a plague in the cities. "

SWE_dissolve_socialst_democracy:0 "An end to Effeminate Democracy"
SWE_dissolve_socialst_democracy_desc:0 "Democracy is degenerate. First practiced in the west by the effeminate money-lending Greek, it is an inherently anti-European concept, as indeed it was not practiced by the warlike tribes of Germania. Democracy, the right for every yokel to intervene in the affairs of state, has always been a fool's bargain, and can simply not be allowed to remain as a concept in the Swedish psyche. Taking inspiration from the things of old, Lindholm and the SSS have decided to involve the Swedish people further in the struggle for a new country, without the delusions of mass involvement. In halls throughout the country, in barns, in warehouses and in fancy offices, people from the local area will be represented, will be able to speak to party leaders, and discuss matters relevant to their locale. This is according to the SSS far better than subjecting itself to some arbitrary democratic mandate, where even the lowest in society has the same voting right as a man of high racial standard and literacy. A proletarian warrior society has no need for the system once practiced by Mediterranean priests and merchants."

SWE_courting_remaining_reaction:0 "Arisk Enighet"
SWE_courting_remaining_reaction_desc:0 "Sven Olov Lindholm created the SSS following the failure of Eric von Rosen to create a unified radical nationalist movement. First coming into contact with von Rosen and Furugård via the now defunct Svenska Antisemitiska Föreningen, the several different attempts by von Rosen to create a unified front would routinely fail, the Swedish right far too splintered on matters of varying levels of importance. Now however, with Sweden in the hands of Lindholm and his cadre of red-dyed nationalists, Lindholm is opening a hand towards his former friends and allies, offering an alliance to save the nation. While himself not entirely as ludicrously rabidly antisemitic as Furugård, nor as entranced by the mystical past as von Rosen, there’s still a need to bring people on side, whether it be officers like Archibald Douglas and Martin Ekström, or pan-aryan philosophers like Per Engdahl."

SWE_militaristic_buildup:0 "Truly Swedish Morality"
SWE_militaristic_buildup_desc:0 "The army needs men like men need water, and thanks to a revolutionary new policy by the SSS, the army will have all that it wants, and more. The period of conscription has been extended by several months, and those refusing service will instead be put in mandatory work in industry, until their conscription period has come to an end. Sweden and Scandinavia as a whole has long had firm convictions in service and in providing to the greater community, and while the SSS has no eagerness in returning to the dire ättestupa tradition, other virtuous principles from the past are to be encouraged. He who can work will work, he who can serve will serve, he who can teach will teach, and as long as this line of thinking is propagated throughout the coming centuries, Sweden will remain blissfully in line with its ancient past. Just like the free peasants of old were expected to provide arms to their king during times of crisis, the freed proletariat of today will do the same."

SWE_devotion_to_leader:0 "Embracing the Vikingabalk"
SWE_devotion_to_leader_desc:0 "The ancient hirds and shieldwalls operated on a single basic fact: That if one man faltered, he’d risk the rest of his troop, and would be discarded. This is the principles espoused by Firthiofs Saga, and its detailed vikingabalk. If one shield failed to raise during battle, if one man stumbled when leaving the longboat, if any man buckled under the pressure at Lützen or Narva, he’d be punished severely, for he would have put all his comrades at risk. Similarly, during times of hardship, it is in Swedish, Scandinavian and Germanic character to rally around the leader, as long as the leader is of solid stock and character. All this is the new principle position of the SSS, and something that shall be ingrained in the Swedish character to be as true and real as the very flag itself. By rallying around Lindholm Sweden is rallying around a historic figure in a time of crisis, just like it has several times throughout history."

SWE_socialist_imperialism:0 "Lindholm’s National Charter"
SWE_socialist_imperialism_desc:0 "Lindholm, recent legal title as Riksledare, has finally published the new national charter, outlining the intentions of the government, the laws that will be followed, and the principles on which the new state will be built upon. Claiming direct continuity from the breakup of the Kalmar Union, Lindholm is working hard to legitimize the state, despite the fact that it is viewed as a pariah by much of the world. With a welfare system written into law, with environmental protections a guarantee, and with certain party specific policies added as a sprinkle on top, the new charter is a most special piece of paper. From birth the charter declares that a Swedish man or woman will be granted the same rights to live and prosper, will both be able to work in industry, and will both equally be represented by the governing system. Furthermore, the new charter specifies that having a pension is a right, that unemployment benefits is a right, and that good moral and racial hygiene will be enforced across the board. Critics from abroad point out that the charter doesn't actually mention ‘socialism’ even once, apart from mentioning that the only legitimate governing entity is the SSS itself."

SWE_statare_reborn:0 "Reforging the Statare"
SWE_statare_reborn_desc:0 "One great example of capitalism and its excess, is the treatment of the statare. Vagabonds and peasants, farmhands and labourers, forced to migrate from farm to farm while housed in barracks and sleeping in dikes along the road, statare are viewed as tragic figures one and all. In a fell swoop, Lindholm and the SSS has enforced payment in currency rather than in stat - or goods - and via extensive land seizures can parcel out both land and housing to the homeless. For the young men who'd once served on farms doing borderline slave-labour for a bite to eat, Lindholm also offers a chance to serve in the army, incentivizing a fast-tracked path into a more decent society."

SWE_peripheral_organs_party:0 "The Eyes of the Revolution"
SWE_peripheral_organs_party_desc:0 "Hugin and Munin advised and spied on behalf of Odin, the all knowing god. Today, Lindholm himself is blessed by having several agents and agencies working on his behalf, attempting to purge the revolution, as well as the country, from subversive elements. Reporting poor conduct is to be rewarded, calling out corruption is to be treated as worthy of recognition, and helping to unveil shadowy cabals of foreign aliens should be deemed worthy of a medal, according to new government policy. A new medal has been introduced, called simply Silvernålen, silverneedle, a pin out of silver and blue enamel given to those who serve the country in rooting out threats to the country, and a campaign to introduce it into public life has begun."

SWE_religious_question:0 "The Synod Must Bend"
SWE_religious_question_desc:0 "Svenska Kyrkan, long an arm of monarchy and conservatism, remains a threat to revolutionary unity. Its current archbishop Erling Eidem absolutely loathes the racialist policies of the government, and in particular the antisemitic slant of Lindholm, having accused Lindholm of being the devil not too long ago. As such, Erling has been put under house arrest, with Lindholm forced to figure out what to do next with both the unruly priest and the church as a whole. While Sweden is rapidly secularizing, the rural powerbase Lindholm is attempting to court is very loyal to the curch, and as such, he cannot abolish or destroy it anytime soon. Its power must be broken or brought to heel. Faith may remain, but it must serve the state, not oppose it."

SWE_to_embolden_a_man:0 "Ett Rött Svea Rike"
SWE_to_embolden_a_man_desc:0 "Sweden has been blessed with competent kings, but quite a few have been absolute rubbish. A true egalitarian nation cannot have a monarchy, it must be guided by true Germanic meritocratic traditions, and as such the nation must be prepared to exist without a monarch going forwards. Despite some having hoped in vain for Lindholm to return the monarchy, even within his own party, Lindholm himself is ambivalent at best, or hostile at worst, to such suggestions. Before Sweden had a monarch, it had chieftains and jarls, and the party is hard at work at linking the position of Riksledare with the traditions of old. Indeed, the etymology of the position and indeed the name Sverige itself directly mentions a kingdom. The kingdom will live on, just without a monarch on the throne, a decent enough compromise."

SWE_command_the_landstormen:0 "Control the Landstormen"
SWE_command_the_landstormen_desc:0 "Landstormen was created as a militia on behalf of the government in the 1880’s, an organization for the older men in society to join during times of crisis, to serve the nation in war without being in the army proper. Although the Landstormen was inherently reactionary, the spirit of defending the nation or tribe against overwhelming odds is an inherently Germanic one, at least according to the SSS. While the Landstormen dissolved during the revolution, Lindholm wants to bring it back, to create a truly national movement for all, instead of just having a Red Guard. "

SWE_true_nordic_socialism:0 "The Path of Nordic Socialism"
SWE_true_nordic_socialism_desc:0 "The destiny of the Germanic world lies in unity, even the deluded fool Nils Flyg knew that. Not content to simply rule Sweden itself, Lindholm has lately been enticed by the writings of Per Engdahl, citing a need for European unity, by force if need be. A pan-European undercurrent has been rising throughout the ranks, a sense that - if Lindholm's revolution succeeds at home - it can and should be exported to the rest of Europe, something that must have surely affected Riksledaren’s thought process."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_Gustaf_V_DESC:0 "Gustaf V Bernadotte was born in 1858 and was the crown-prince of Sweden and Norway from 1872. It is no wonder that he is a man of the old ways, as during his father's reign the King of Sweden acted both as head of state and head of government, with ministers held responsible only to him. However, just two years before Gustaf's ascension to the throne, in 1905 his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament.\n\nWhen Gustaf first took the throne in 1907 he also ended a Swedish tradition of roughly 700 years when he refused a coronation. As such, during his reign as a king, he never wore a crown. While at first ambivalent about the Swedish politicians he angered in February 1914, when the Swedish liberal government wanted to cut in military spending. After holding a speech condemning their actions, the liberal government stepped down and was replaced by civil servants appointed by Gustav himself. In the following 1917 elections the Liberals and Social democrats made heavy gains, but Gustaf still attempted installing a conservative government. However, they were unable to form a coalition and Gustaf realised he could no longer appoint governments of his own choosing. During the following reforms, he found himself forced to act upon his minister's advice, and not the other way around."
politics_nils_flyg_desc:0 "The figurehead of Swedish totalism, Nils 'Nisse' Flyg, is considered by many to be a colourful character. Born in the Stockholm working-class neighbourhood of Södermalm, Flyg has been active in the Swedish radical left since a young age. In 1917, he split off from the SAP with Zeth Höglund and Karl Kilbom to form the Swedish Communist Party, a brief experiment that soon failed when the Russian revolution was crushed. Nonetheless, the young Flyg would prove to be a force to be reckoned within the Swedish left.\n\nIn more recent years, Flyg distanced himself from his less radical comrades and took on the doctrine of total commitment to the Revolution propagated by the Sorelians in the Commune of France and Oswald Mosley in the Union of Britain, though adding his own unique values to it as well: Flyg is known to oppose notions of an indigenous socialist revolution in America and, ironic to his previous positions, Russia, believing that the revolution has to originate in Europe as it would otherwise take the shape of anti-European imperialism, noting on the side that neither Russia nor America harbours an orthodox totalist movement."

SWE_totalist_party_long:0 "Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti\n§LCommunist Party of Sweden§!\nSveriges Nationalsyndikalistiska Parti\n§LNational Syndicalist Party of Sweden§!\n§gThe Swedish fringes house quite a few odd bedfellows, forced to cooperate, forced into rivalry by differing ideologies. Following the chaos of the Russian revolution, the Swedish left splintered, forming a whole host of different parties, the two most prominent and radical being the SKP and the SNSP, themselves splitting from the SSV, which split from the SAP. SKP, led by Sven Linderot and Hugo Sillén want a Swedish communist state styled after the failed Russian experiment, the party having close ties to the exiled bolsheviks in Paris, and communicating frequently with Zinoviev. Inspired by tales of bolshevik heroism and proletarian struggle in the east, the SKP views a socialist Sweden as taking an active part in the world revolution, preferably with cooperation from other socialist states. Outraged and dismayed by the collapse of the Russian reds in the civil war, Nils Flyg and fellow members of the SSV instead turned to Paris and London for inspiration, with Flyg himself later taking on the role as Sweden's most adamant follower of the new vogue of Totalism. Splitting from the SSV due to their unwillingness to embrace more radical politics, Nils Flyg’s national syndicalist party has taken the left by storm, in particular since Flyg is well known for his revolutionary credentials and willingness to work with more unsavoury elements to secure a socialist Sweden.§!"


SWE_totalist_C_party_long:0 "Sveriges Kommunistiska Parti\n§LCommunist Party of Sweden§!\n§gActing as a solid force on the left of Swedish politics, the SKP intends to drag Sweden kicking and screaming into the new socialist world order, hoping that by hook or by crook a Russian style socialist system can be implanted into Swedish society, just like Lenin would have wanted. Putting a great effort on industry and education, as well as subjugating clubs and associations under the SKP umbrella, the party hopes to remain in power in Sweden for generations to come, building communism bit by bit. Scoffing at syndicalists for being too soft and naive, while accusing the remaining SNSP loyalists of being Mosleyite thugs, the SKP views itself as a moderate yet revolutionary force, abjuring from the revolutionary romanticism of Zinoviev.§!"


SWE_totalist_flyg_party_long:0 "Sveriges Nationalsyndikalistiska parti\n§LNational Syndicalist Party of Sweden§!\n§gNils Flyg and his party have worked tirelessly for more than a decade to cement themselves in Swedish society, advocating for worker control over industry as well as a system free of bourgeois oppression and abuse. According to Flyg and his SNSP, a goal as great as socialism demands absolute sacrifice, complete subjugation, and a complete proletarian mobilization. Gathering supporters from all across the Swedish political spectrum by force, ranging from elements of the former far right to the so called lumpenproletariat, Flyg does not just want to create a socialist Sweden as such, he wants to build the country anew entirely.!"


SWE_totalist_lind_party_long:0 "Svensk Socialistisk Samling - §LSwedish Socialist Gathering§!LThe curious creation of Sven Olov Lindholm, SSS was formed out of the failure by the Swedish far right to unite under one common cause. Dismayed by SRNS being unwilling to subjugate capital under the state, upset by SNSP wanting to embark on a brutal industrialization scheme, and loathing the play-pretend bolsheviks of the SKP, the SSS was quite literally formed out of reaction, though this does not make it inherently reactionary. Taking inspiration from the legionaries of the Iron Guard but without their violence, studying the works of Mussolini and Mosley without slavishly following them, Lindholm wishes the SSS to become a mass party. Obsessing with a sense of Swedish purity in mindset and community, hostile to foreign elements real and imagined, most of its ideology is still undetermined. Indeed, despite Lindholms propensity for elaborate speeches, it seems the policies of the SSS are being created as he goes along. As far as the world knows, Lindholm and his SSS are either opportunists aiming for working class support, uncommitted thugs, or earnest advocates of a new system.!”


SWE_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation\n§LCentral Organisation of the Workers of Sweden§!\n§gThe beating heart of Swedish syndicalism, the SAC and their paper the Arbetaren keep the dream alive, be it on barricades or strike actions or in protests throughout the country. Not aligned with any other Swedish political party, the SAC takes great inspiration from the happenings in Paris and London, believing that the true path of the Swedish worker lies in syndicalism above all else. Filled with different strains of leftist thought, be it more anarchist to the more class-collaborationist, the SAC is a broad left church, though one with the unifier being syndicalism. If SAC had their way, Sweden would be a commune in the style of their friends in Paris, free and loving of liberty, united in the cause of a socialist and syndicalist Sweden.§!"


SWE_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti\n§LSwedish Social Democratic Left Party§!\n§gSplitting from the SAP during the First Weltkrieg, the SSV was ruptured by splinterings and internal party disputes from the outset. As the Russian revolution collapsed into chaos, the Russian aligned communists were expelled from the party in a series of brutal factional disputes, creating the SKP as a result. Following the emergence of Mosley and Mussolini and their so called totalism, Nils Flyg and his so called national syndicalists were thrown out of the party as well, following an abortive inner-party coup by Flyg. Despite these inner rifts however, the SSV remains committed to the cause of Swedish socialism, thanks to its current leader Zeth Höglund and his bourgeois protege Karin Boye. Although on paper led by Höglund, the party is closely tied to and controlled by the Swedish delegation to the Third Internationale, the so called Paris Clique, the main actor of which being Karl Kilbom. Not exactly eager to cooperate with the SAP on account of SSV accusing the former of having betrayed the proletariat, on special occasions however the SSV and SAP can close ranks, if only to further the goals of the worker. Perhaps the party most well known and connected to Paris and London, SSV nevertheless remains pragmatic in regards to the path of socialism, open to both parliamentary struggle as well as revolutionary action. Eager to cooperate with their friends in the Third Internationale, the SSV are not syndicalist, though they take lessons from experiments in France.§!"


SWE_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Arbetarepartiet\n§LSwedish Social Democratic Workers' Party§!\n§gHjalmar Branting created the modern SAP, a party built on cooperation and friendship among all men, across all classes, building socialism by gradual means. It is this gradualism, this belief in a slow march towards a more equal society, that has shattered the Swedish left. Once a behemoth of left worker power, the SAP’s eagerness to cooperate with past and present governments, as well as limiting itself to legal reform, resulted in its more radical youth movement splitting off to form the SSV, itself later splitting further. Since its first social democratic prime minister Hjalmar Branting, elected PM between 1919 to 1924, the party has been led since 1928 by Per Albin Hansson, an advocate of class cooperation and his ‘folkhemmet’ idea, that any Swedish government must be built out of cooperation by all classes in society, in favour of all the people in the country, for the benefit of the Swedish nation. Hanssons first cabinet took form in 1928, and although successful in pushing through reforms and furthering the idea of a welfare state, he lost reelection in 1932 in favour of Arvid Lindman, the rival on the right of the riksdag. Per Albin Hansson and his protege Tage Erlander are preparing for the next election with great care and effort, still adhering to the ideals of folkhemmet while attempting to calm rightist sentiment that they are syndicalists in disguise. Despite being a social democratic party at its core, like their friends in the German SPD they’ve been forced or otherwise been changed by the first weltkrieg, becoming more eager to cooperate with both army and ‘powers that be’ to achieve power and maintain the nation.§!"


SWE_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Bondeförbundet\n§LFarmers' League§!\n§gSweden is a rural country, filled with forests and farms, lakes and fields. Bondeförbundet aims to speak for those who live outside of the cities, far from hard toil on the land, far from those who own the farms that fill the bellies of the nation. Although an agrarian focus can be found throughout the Swedish right, only Bondeförbundet speaks for the farmer no matter his stature, no matter if he’s dirt poor or affluent. Primarily a party found in rural areas, the party has hitherto been on the sidelines of Swedish politics, aiming to press for farmer-centric reforms, eager to work with anyone not on the far left or the furthest right to achieve their goals. Lately the Bondeförbundet has taken on a more liberal slant, wanting to migrate away from just being a party of the rural man, hoping to capitalize on the growing strata of civil servants and young professionals with a more Swedish style of liberalism.§!"

SWE_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Folkpartiet\n§LPeople's Party§!\n§gThe beacon of liberalism in Swedish politics, Folkpartiet advocates for a strictly proper fiscal policy and for the thousands of mini-entrepreneurs throughout the country, as well as a friendly state with programs for the poorest, without socialist overreach or abuse. Folkpartiet wants to see a Sweden that is caring and compassionate, but independent from the whims of either right or the left, where every man woman and child is able to advance themselves in society by the sweat of their brow and a supportive nudge from the government.

Formed out of formerly independent politicians and smaller conservative parties, the AV wants a strong and conservative Sweden, free from both liberal delusions and extremist abuse. Bagge wants back to a more proper time, where people were pious and in church, where the local priest was respected, and where the riksdag was filled with endless arguments and corruption scandals. Inspired by the greatest periods of Swedish history, AV knows that Swedish history and success is built on piety and devotion to the Swedish way of life, as well as to modesty and moderation. Sceptical to welfare systems but not willing to dismantle them, eager to fund the military but scared of adventurism abroad, the AV has increasingly taken the position as a part of the opposition - even when being in power. Having had several prime ministers in the past, the AV is wary of resting on its laurels, as Gösta Bagge is painfully aware that his fellow colleagues in the party grow increasingly resigned to a Spanish style turnismo. Lately the AV has been hard at work painting the SAP as far more radical than it actually is, doing much to paint Hansson out as a borderline traitor to the country or a useful idiot to Paris, while failing to put much effort in what they themselves believe.§!"

Attempting to avoid the failings of past conservative parties and experiments, the party tries its best to keep snobbishness at bay, attempting to even foster a strong presence in the working classes by encouraging membership in professional (and loyal) craft unions. Still sceptical of welfare as a concept, the party knows that it cannot remove institutions the voters now view as permanent, and as such they would attempt to infuse conservative values into the burgeoning public healthcare system.§!"

Closely aligned with AV, with several members being part of both organizations, but not exactly tied to it, the FS views the riksdag in contempt and wants a more direct leader to save the nation, preferably one from their own ranks.

Under its latest leader Elmo Lindholm the organisation has taken on a more Maurassian slant, taking inspiration not only from the former, but also from trends throughout Europe such as political combat squads and modern propaganda. Impressing the rightist media apparatus, Elmo Lindholm and his SNF, alongside its Kamporganisation known publicly as the Greyshirts ‘Gråskjortor’ under Alf Meyerhöffer, represent a serious threat on the right. Accusing the SAP of being bolsheviks and syndicalists, agents of jewish internationalism and whatever else can be found under the sun, Lindholm and Meyerhöffer are well known (and disliked) by both the right and left for their reactionary ideals.

The name comes from the believed grapes that grew in the area, as the Vin stands for ‘wine’, however this can be disputed as also meaning ‘pasture’ or ‘meadow’. As of yet, no tangible evidence of Viking settlements have been found, but many documents from the kings of Denmark aid in the belief of a viking settlement long before Columbas ever arrived at the New world. Excavations and archeologists from our prestigious schools have already begun arriving, hoping to find and uncover any physical proof of Nordic settlements, it now only remains a matter of time until we do. \n\nWhile such history remains interesting, using this belief of the first North American colony from Europe has allowed us to establish a colonial government there, mimicking our current government. Whether such a state will be successful remains to be seen, but this is another step in uncovering our history."

The current Swedish government has shown in a display of power, the rising of the Swedish flag over the town hall in Hamina, once called Fredrikshamn when under the Swedish Empire, where the former Treaty of Fredrikshamn was signed, ceded Finland to Russia. \n\nWith such a display, many Finns have started coming out in resistance to the Swedish occupation, many putting aside their ideological differences in defence of Finnish independence. Such resistance has been met harshly with Swedish soldiers and officers as the Stockholm government decides on what to do with their newfoundland. \n\nThe first and most straightforward option is total annexation and reintegration of Finland into Sweden. This would force a long and arduous process of annihilating Finnish culture and sovereignty, while likely suffering strong resistance from the native Finns. Some in government say this is the only option as, like Jörmungandr, in an immortal cycle of allowing the Finns self-governance will only lead to constant rebellion. \n\nAnother camp favors the idea of integrating the Finns but offers another solution. Annex the main areas that house a large Swedish presence, and install a puppet administration over the rest to subdue the Finnish resistance while also slowly forcing their reintegration back into Sweden. \n\nA final group sees the total integration of Finland as a truly impossible feat, due to Finland’s many years of self-governance, forcing a reintegration would doom Sweden with economic issues and constant uprisings. As such they advocate for putting a pro-Swedish government in charge of Finland, giving the Finns a sense of self-governance while still keeping them aligned with Sweden. \n\nA choice must be made soon, as the Finnish resistance only grows with each passing day."

Blowing up buildings, harassing outposts and doing much to further the Norwegian commitment to the war effort, it is clear that something has to be done to stop this threat. Enter a certain Harry Söderman, who claims to have a solution to the Linge thorn. \n\nHarry Söderman, known among colleagues in criminology as 'Revolver Harry' is a distinctly creative policeman, having studied forensic science throughout europe, even working in new york city to establish police laboratories there. With his experience he has been hard at work on numerous cases, ranging from the Ådalen shootings, the investigation into the Lindbergh kidnapping, as well as a few murder cases in Sweden itself. A dedicated adventurer however, Harry has found the prospect of finding a counter to the Linge group a most interesting one, and has petitioned the government and the army proper for the creation of a loyal Norwegian unit to be used in counterinsurgency. Arguing that there are many Norwegian prisoners and friendly exiles in Sweden proper, Harry suggests training those with military experience or fervent enough opposition to the current Norwegian government to fight alongside Swedish forces. A secretive project, the Norwegian soldiers would be trained fully, and expected to operate under Norwegian officers, all under the label of 'police troops', Polistrupperna in Swedish, Polistropperne in Norwegian. Seeing as the war likely wont be over soon, it is up to the government if they want to dedicate time to create a combat unit of Norwegians to fight their own countrymen, or if the government aims to simply slug it out with Kompani Linge as they have up to this point."

Norwegian officers have been trained and are in the business of leading their men through seemingly endless exercises, but it is becoming clear that they are eager for a proper fight against their countrymen in Kompani Linge. As the war rages on against the Norwegian government, the exiles are practically chomping at the bits to abandon their barracks and rush into the forests, to liberate their homes from the 'rogue government'. Still, some argue that the exiles are a bit too green, a bit too eager, and quite frankly a bit too suspicious. Not too long ago a strange event occurred when some exiles decided to blow up their own barrack toilet with a hand grenade, something viewed as either intentional sabotage or an unserious disposition on behalf of the soldiers in question. \n\nHarry Söderman remains adamant about the unit. He claims that the unit is loyal to both the Swedish government and to the war as a whole, and argues firmly that if the unit is not throw into battle soon enough the exiles will view the unit only as an elaborate ploy to keep them occupied, rather than as an active intentioned combat unit."

Although the first few months of the unit in action consisted of trying and failing to locate Kompani Linge, sometimes even stumbling into isolated Norwegian patrols mistaken for their main target, lately the unit has seen a long string of successes. A series of Norwegian cells have been discovered in areas viewed as free from hostile activity, combat encounters are steadily growing in our favour, and now finally Kompani Linge itself has been tracked down - attempting to exfiltrate from the countryside via small boats. After a brief skirmish during which Linge himself was fatally wounded, the most of the commando unit surrendered, handing their arms over to the victorious exiles.\n\nHarry Söderman, the creator of the project and its guardian, partook in the skirmish and has nothing but glowing reviews of his own force. Already plans are being made to disband the troops into regular loyal police, or to use them as the nucleus for a liberated Norwegian mass force, but those discussions might be a bit premature. There are still some hostile units in the countryside, there's still widespread discontent in the Norwegian populace as a whole over the war, and the once brotherly bonds between the two nations have been thuroughly tested. Still, the police troops have done their bit for the war as a whole, and should surely be viewed as heroes."

It saved Europe from catholic dominion when Gustaf II Adolf rushed south to aid his fellow protestants in Germany, dealing a terrifying blow to the papists in the south, shattering the supposed remnant of the Roman Empire in the process. It saved Europe again in the 18th century, when during the Great Northern War Swedish soldiers under the warrior-king Karl XII fought the slavic despotism of Tsar Peter, the despicable Poles, the servile Saxons... Indeed, had Gustav III's pleas been heeded, perhaps the French Revolution would have been snuffed in its cradle, preventing Europe from sliding into chaos of liberalism and reaction in the process. In the end, only under the leadership of Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, Karl XIV Johan, did the subsequent Napoleonic menace face its end. n/n/Once again at a crossroads of history, Sweden most take a great grip of fate, and once again ride out to save Europe from itself, from Slavic aggression, from Capitalist perversion, from Prussian-Saxon aristocratic ineptitude.

sweden.1.d:0 "After the hard-fought victory of the German Empire in the Weltkrieg, the German nation sought to expand her influence and power. With vast swathes of Afrika, East-Asia and Europe now under either colonial regimes or allied crowns, the Germans created in themselves a new source of dominance. During this, German businesses sought to expand within Sweden, with our vast iron and zinc mining operations in the north, to factories and stores in the urban south, almost half of all Swedish companies can either trace their benefactors or direct ownership to the German Empire. This initially seemed to only benefit Sweden, providing much needed jobs to the unemployed, increased industrialization as well as further German immigration.\n\nHowever, it has not come without a cost, many of these businessmen hold sways on politicians in the Riksdag which many in Sweden see as a slow German takeover. The Swedish Social Democratic Workers party has continued their agenda of the removal of key German businesses to maintain Sweden’s sovereignty and neutrality on the global scale, tantalizing the fear of Sweden becoming yet another puppet colony in Germany's collection. While many in the General Electoral League believe only minor reform is needed to control the German influence in Sweden's favour, however some in the People’s Party are leaning towards the Social Democrat cause which has put strain on the centre-right coalition. As such, the Riksdag remains once again torn on the subject, with no succinct outcome decided on."

While the fallen Kingdom of Britain and Republic of France both fell to the hordes of Syndicalists, Russia is currently under the leadership of the so-called Social Liberal Kerensky since the ravages of the Russian Civil War. However this apparent stability has not stopped some wayward Swedes from aligning with those considered flung too far outside the political scene. \n\nOn the centre-left are the Farmers’ League, seen as an agrarian and socially liberal party, they enjoy much of their support from the rural farmer base, most commonly found in coalition with the larger leftist parties, it's possible they may be swayed right if the conditions are good. The largest Leftist party, lead by Per Albin Hansson, presiding over the Swedish Social Democratic Workers’ Party which maintains a centre-left to moderate-left political stance, also remaining to adhere to the Monarchy Sweden currently holds. Further left are the Swedish Social Democratic Left Party, a contingent of more Radical social democrats that adhere to many of Per Albin Hansson’s policies bar the question of the Monarchy, seeing it as a symbol of reactionary tradition, believing Sweden can only truly be free when she is a republic. \n\nInspired by those in France and Britain, a syndicalist group calling themselves the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden, hope to abolish the monarchy and bring about a syndicalist revolution in Sweden like other syndicalist nations. They share membership with the Left party but are barred from coalition status as they are seen as far too radical. Finally are the splinter parties of the National Syndicalist Party of Sweden and the Communist Party of Sweden, headed by Nils Flyg and Sven Linderot respectively. Sharing many of the similar policies, due to their small status they are in coalition with each other in the hope of achieving more seats in the Riksdag, while a victory for them is impossible, they may be invited by other factions. \n\nOn the Right is the Peoples’ Party, a classical liberal group seen as a moderate bridge between both the centre right and left, it currently enjoys coalition status with the conservatives. The largest Conservative party is the General Electoral League, currently led by Gösta Bagge, it believes in the ideas of a protectionist economy while maintaining conservative values, adhering close to the Crown of Sweden. Further right resides small scatterings of military cliques and ultra-nationalist paramilitaries, the largest military clique residing around Helge Jung, with his group nicknamed the ‘Jung Junta’. Within the Ultra-nationalist groups preside Archibald Douglas, a leading military figure, Birger Furugård whose policies echo that of the legionnaires throughout Europe, and Elmo Lindholm following a Maurassian system of governance.."

sweden.8.d:0 "The concept of armoured car has been around since before the Weltkrieg, and while the muddy and harsh terrains of Somme, Verdun and Passchendaele certainly showed the limitations of this new innovation, other theatres and conflicts since have shown that the armoured car does have its uses. However, this has led some to wonder: could this concept be scaled down even further, to be operate by merely two men on a motorcycle, yet protected from the small arms of their enemies? The concept itself has existed in some capacity since the Weltkrieg but has rarely seen widespread adoption due to numerous factors. Yet the homegrown Landsverk company here in Sweden aims to change this fact, with their newly introduced Landsverk L-190 armoured motorcycle. Armed with the ksp m/14-29 machine gun and shielded by numerous armoured plates, the hulking tortoise motorcycle has frontal protection for both crewmen, made mostly of riveted plates, the gunner’s seat covered by a tub-like half-ring while the driver is sat behind a slightly tilted plate.\n\nThe vehicle, designed in 1930, has been undergoing trials with the Swedish army for nearly half a decade now under the name of pansrad mc or pansarbil fm/30, and while the design is rather rudimentary and the armour slows down the otherwise speedy motorcycle quite a bit, it is generally a liked design. However, given the recent developments in armoured car technology, such a budget measure may seem too rudimentary for the Swedish army, especially given that Landsverk is already hard at work producing famous armoured cars such as the Landsverk L-180 and the Landsverk Lynx."
sweden.8.a:0 "Interesting concept, but will it stand the trials of war?"

sweden.9.t:0 "Landsverk L-210"
sweden.9.d:0 "As the trials of Landsverk L-190 armoured motorcycle are slowly coming to an end, and debates on the usefulness of such a vehicle are on-going among the procurement staff of the Swedish armed forces, opponents of the vehicles adoption have brought out the case of Landsverk L-210. Whereas the L-190 was originally meant for the Swedish army from the start, the L-210 started off as a Danish order for a similar, but further refined vehicle. Denmark, as the smaller and obviously poorer little brother of Sweden, was struggling to finance true armoured cars in large numbers, and was thus looking to buy an alternative.\n\nThe Landsverk company, having already undertaken a similar project, proposed a design of their own, which was the rather odd-shaped Landsverk L-210. Unlike the earlier and simpler L-190, the 210 used mainly welded armour and had an almost fully enclosed crew compartment, with armour provided to the sides of the vehicle as well. However, due to weight constraints given the thirty horsepower engine, the armour was four and a half centimetres thick and thus wholly insufficient against rifle calibre bullets, with the angling of the vehicle being the only means to make it truly bulletproof, a hard ask in the heat of combat. The Danes requested a departure from the medium machine gun of the Swedish L-190, mounting the locally built Madsen machine gun into the L-210 instead.\n\nHowever, as the first vehicles arrived to Denmark and underwent testing, it soon became evident that the lack of armour and most importantly, terrible steering and controllability of the heavy and underpowered vehicle made it completely useless in military use, and the top speed of 50 kilometres per hour made it a slug compared to even some armoured cars in Danish service. However, when the case of the L-210 was brought up as a denouncement of the L-190 program in Sweden, the Landsverk company revealed plans for the updated model of L-210, with an improved layout, stronger engine and interestingly, a swivel mount for the machine gun that allowed for it to be used in an anti-aircraft role. The Danes have apparently become more interesting in this new variant, and while the sceptics in Swedish army remain somewhat aloof towards the updated variant, it has rejuvenated the entire discussion of armoured motorcycles somewhat.

As such, our trade relations became increasingly one-sided, being aimed at countries in the tariff-free zone: Germany, Denmark and the German puppet states on the Baltic coast, at the cost of other trading partners such as Norway and Great Britain, with whom trading is subject to tariffs, or, in the latter case, even embargoes."

sweden.15.d:0 "The Paris Clique, formed a round the Swedish delegation to the Third Internationale, has sent word to their comrades in the SSV and SAP that they intend to return home during this election year.\n\nFollowing the collapse of the Russian bolsheviks, Swedish communists found themselves without a guiding light... Until the French Commune was established and the Union of Britain was declared. Karl Kilbom, Nils Flyg and Zeth Höglund, prominent socialists and devoted communists, saw in the emergence of the western syndicalist revolt material proof that syndicalism was the true path to Marx's vision, rather than the theories espoused by Lenin and his successors. Karl Kilbom would continue to call himself a communist, but would openly declare himself interested in the syndicalist developments in France, becoming leader of the Swedish delegation there. Nils Flyg, devoted to the cause of Swedish Marxism by any means necessary, found comfort in the atmosphere of revolution and urgency in Paris and London, since it distracted him from the tragedy of his most personal loss, his six year old daughter Solveig whom had just died of tuberculosis. With great vigour and energy, Nils Flyg became known among the more radical ends of the Third Internationale, visiting London and Paris repeatedly, brushing shoulders with everyone from Doriot and Valois to the rising star Mosley. Zeth Höglund, known for his pacifism and refusal to sanction anything other than a peoples revolution, found himself entranced by the energy of social upheaval and proper workers justice, and moved to argue the case of the SSV in the endless congresses of Paris.\n\nSince the heyday of the revolution just a decade or so ago, the Paris Clique has worked hard to influence the SSV to take a more syndicalist position, forming such ties within the party as a whole to effectively run it from abroad. With Kilbom being the face of Swedish socialism internationally, and Nils Flyg in frequent debates and conversations with Mosley, Zeth 'Zäta' Höglund has taken the position as the SSV's informal leader. Pressuring Per Albin Hanssons SAP to join in a coalition with them in the next election, the Paris Clique intend to force the revolution, believing that the compromise politics of the SAP verges on the reactionary. Should the revolution come to Swedish shores, Kilbom and his comrades are already prepared, with arms, men, and a healthy dose of revolutionary bureaucracy."

sweden.16.t:0 "The True Believers"
sweden.16.d:0 "While the Paris Clique ingratiated themselves with syndicalists and other fellow travellers, the true sons of Marx and the hero Lenin remained. Sven Linderot and Hugo Sillén believe that the revolution failed in Russia because of outside forces, instead of their ideology being flawed. Believing that western socialists like Kautsky and Luxembourg had doomed the cause by failing to rouse their own people in revolt against the forces hostile to red Russia, Linderot and Sillén put the blame squarely on foreign outside forces,  rather than blaming Lenin or Zinoviev or even Trotsky. What followed in Paris and London was positive, something Linderot and Sillén view favourably, but does not somehow mean the borderline bourgeois tendencies of syndicalism is somehow an acceptable substitute to full true workers control. Indeed, while the Paris Clique of Kilbom Flyg and Höglund slavishly heap praise upon a system that is, to-Linderot and Sillén-fundamentally reactionary, the two comrades have formed close bonds with the Russian Bolsheviks in exile. From their newspaper 'Norrskensflamman' Sillén calls for world revolution on the daily, showering praise on the heroes of the Russian revolution, spewing bile about the German 'socialist' traitors and their puppet dog Kerensky in the process. Constantly threatened with assassination and murder, Sillén remains in Sweden, while his comrade Linderot remains in Paris to encourage foreign support.\n\n Sven Linderot, known primarily for his heroic act of breaking the blockade on Petrograd by rushing the port with the SS Eskilstuna III, is well known among Scandinavian communists not blinded by the splendour of Paris. A keen debater, Linderot can hold speeches for hours, can spar verbally with any man, and is devoted to the cause of world revolution. Though still believing that a peaceful way to socialism is possible, he's more than willing to fight for it too. If Linderot is the energetic fighter for a red future, Hugo Sillén is the slow methodical prophet, perhaps too slow, as he's often accused by comrades of being tardy and lacking initiative. Sillén knows however that most of these accusations come from foreign delegates or agents thereof, and has little interest in doing anything other than staying the course. He writes, he creates propaganda, and when the time for the revolution comes he's ready to implement everything required to preserve and protect a Swedish path to socialism."

Presenting his service to the new Finnish government, Mannerheim was appointed commander-in-chief and successfully defended the government from the reds, and while he fought for the finnish government, the government had little love for him. From the very moment Mannerheim returned home from Russia rumors roamed about how he was a Russian agent, or had loyalties elsewhere than Finland. After all, while Mannerheim could write in Finnish, his grasp of the language back in 1917 was less than stellar. He spoke Swedish at home, had spoken Russian back in his time in the Russian Army, and in Russian high society he had spoken French. Indeed, even his mannerisms were something others would take offense to, or as an indication that he somehow would act against the interests of his home country. Aristocratic to a fault, raised to be curt with staff and almost seemingly aloof, Mannerheim definitely was not everyones choice for leader of the newly formed Finnish army. Even when the Finnish parliament appointed Mannerheim the leader of the army there was dissent among politicians, some questioning if not it would be better with a German commander, seeing as the lawmakers-interim or not-were keen on getting German protection. Although knowing about the worrying developments in the rear, Mannerheim and his men bravely fought and saved Finland from the onslaught of Kullervo Manner and his red bandits, but once the guns fell silent Mannerheim was rudely surprised. After taking leave from the army to visit relatives in Stockholm, Mannerheim was informed that the Finnish government were still adamant about appointing a German monarch to the throne, and when meeting with ambassadors from the Entente, Mannerheim vocally and clearly objected to the idea. Following this clear protest, Mannerheim was sent abroad by the Finnish government, hoping to achieve recognition from the western powers.\n\nAfter achieving his goals in diplomacy abroad, with Finland recognized as an independent state by all, even if a bit begrudgingly by the Russian whites, Mannerheim never returned back to Finland. Still objecting to the idea of a German monarch despite his own monarchist tendencies, disliking the focus on building an army around Germany and the Finnish jägers, Mannerheim remained in Stockholm. Since making Stockholm his home, Mannerheim has been embraced by the Swedish army and the Swedish right, but this does not mean Mannerheim himself considers himself shackled to the Swedish cause. Since Finlands independence Mannerheim has become fluent in Finnish, though he speaks slowly and with a strong pronunciation, and he frequently communicates and visits the land of his birth. Together with compatriots and friends, Mannerheim stands ready to save Finland once more should it be needed, once it is no longer a mere German puppet state."

With the army already a hotbed of reaction and antisocialist views, it should hardly come as a surprise to see that several officers and men took leave to fight in Finland, crossing the border dedicated to ending the red menace. These troops formed in a battalion, led by Persian Gendarme veterans Harald Hjalmarson and his subordinate Martin Ekström, did not just view joining the war in Finland as an act of brotherliness, but as an active crusade against socialism. Having fought Russians in the past, Harald and Martin found themselves in a ruthless war not just against Russian reds, but Finns too, perhaps this being what would motivate them to turn their force into a agent of white terror. As one of the few units under white command that consisted of professional soldiers, apart from the Finnish-German jägers or former tsarist Finnish officers, the Swedish battalion was used as a shock element against dug in reds, taking part in major battles throughout the civil war. \n\nFollowing the end of the civil war, and Mannerheim leaving the country over increasing disputes with the white government of Svinhufvud and their pro-German stance, the Swedish Brigade followed him back to Stockholm, marching in parade after disembarking at port. Not content with just fighting in Finland, Ekström and a cadre of likeminded officers and men took to fighting in Estonia too, embarking on a daring campaign from Reval all the way to Narva, commanding and aided by a force of Estonians, Finns, Swedes, and every other anticommunist that could be found. At home however, while Ekström fought against the bolsheviks, his former commander Hjalmarson killed himself, never quite having recovered from the atrocities of the civil war. As such, when Ekström returned home, not only did he find himself courted by officers in high positions, but the Swedish right in general, and the Swedish extreme right in particular.\n\n When the clash between workers and the government happened in Ådalen in 1931, Ekström became convinced further that Swedish society was infilitrated and infested with socialist agitation. Creating a not-so-secret unit of dedicated antisocialists from both the army and the general public, Ekström promised elements of the right that-should the time come-Ekström could mobilize around a thousand men in defence of the nation. Coming into contact with the von Rosen family, whom introduced him to Birger Furugård and the junior-yet-radical officer Sven Olov Lindholm, Ekström was prompted by fellow civil war active Eric von Rosen to form a unified Swedish nationalist block, which would never come to pass. Furugård was too extreme and focused on racial questions Ekström hardly understood, Ekström was far too uncharismatic to rally anyone other than already true believers, and Lindholm refused to play second fiddle, not to mention disliking the aristocratic makeup of this supposed block. In the years that followed Lindholm and Furugård both came in contact with the decisively socialist Nils Flyg individually, while Ekström and von Rosen instead chose to put their faith and trust in the Army, such as the general Archibald Douglas.\n\nToday Furugård operates his own party loosely inspired by the German DVLP competing for votes along the fringes with Lindholm, who has taken a more totalist turn politically. Ekström has further ingratiated himself with Douglas, and has formed a political action force that nominally pretends to be an actual political party. The Swedish far right is splintered, but not inactive."

sweden.22.d:0 "The port city of Gothenburg is closed today as the affiliated unions of the SAC protest the governments inability to handle the Black Monday crisis, as well as the government being slavish followers of the capitalist oppressor system. These strikes are not new, as since the 20's the Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation has been actively and routinely protesting against the government and fat-cats alike, bringing the city and its port to a standstill. Often facing of against union representatives and 'guards' from the SAP as well as the police, the SAC take a stand for the worker in these hard times. \n\nThe SAC, Central Worker's Organisation of Sweden, is one of the most radical workers associations in the entire country. A grand block of syndicalist unions in opposition to the reformists of the SAP controlled union umbrella organisation the Landsorganisationen, the SAC exists in constant struggle against intolerance inequality and imperialism. Formed in 1910 and determined in their refusal to participate in mainline bourgeois politics, the SAC fights with the LO often, facing off in strike action frequently, and only cooperating when the stars align. Believing that the workers in the LO have been decieved by reformism and capitalist coercion, the SAC yearn for a day when the workers will see the light and join their cause, the cause of syndicalist economic democracy.\n\nSyndicalist from the outset, the SAC has seen the tide of history turn, looking with horror as the Russian revolution devolved into bloodshed, while eagerly observing the turn of history in London and Paris. Inspired by their comrades in the west, the SAC has taken on a much more militant tone the last few years, turning the Paris Clique of Kilbom and the SSV from potential allies into revolutionary rivals. While Kilbom wants a gradual Swedish transition into a more equal society, inspired by and and taking lessons from Paris, the SAC views this as just a shallow imitation of the gradualist reformism of the SAP, with a redder shade to the mask. The SAC refuses to cooperate with the SSV or Nils Flyg and his group despite their syndicalist connections, demanding to be as independent as possible, not wanting their cause subverted in the name of some lofty statist goal. If the SAC has their way, the revolution will come from the workers, from the unions, without influence from bourgeois politicans in the SAP and SSV or their pretend-bolshevik allies in the SKP. Although partaking in the delegation in Paris, the SAC under their dual leaders Frans Severin and Elise Ottesen-Jensen guard their independence jealously, and operate outside of both Paris and Kilboms control."

sweden.23.t:0 "The Issue of ‘Lex Hinke’" #Contraception event 1938
sweden.23.d:0 "‘Lex Hinke’ remains the law in Sweden, maintaining a complete ban on the use, sale, and recommendation of contraceptives. First introduced in 1910 after socialist writer Hinke Bergegren, who died in 1936, published his book ‘Love Without Children’, the law was created in response to his ideas. Bergegren argued for adult sexuality without the obligation of children and promoted the legalization of contraceptives, claiming such a change would benefit Swedish society.\n\nThe debate has endured for nearly three decades. Opponents, ranging from moderate Social Democrats to the Farmers’ League, the People’s Party and the Conservatives, argue that legalization would weaken population growth in a country already small compared to Europe’s great powers, and that it risks undermining traditional moral standards by separating sexuality from family life. Supporters respond that contraceptives grant women greater freedom and equality, while also helping prevent children from being raised in broken or harmful households. A more unusual form of support has also come from some circles on the far right, who argue that widespread use of contraceptives could serve their vision of preserving Swedish identity by limiting births among groups they consider undesirable.\n\nWith both critics and advocates active once again, the government must decide whether Sweden will maintain its current stance or embrace a new approach. The decision will shape how Swedish society views family, morality, and personal freedom in the years to come."

According to contacts in the west and east, both the Internationale and the Russians are devising some kind of major weapon based on the power of the atom, something that, in the words of Siegbahn, would result in a rather big bang. According to the group of three, access to and harnessing of said power would be beneficial to Sweden, being able to counter a lack in manpower with sheer power potential. Nobody would dare attack Sweden if it could drop some hypothetical super-bomb on them, after all. Following internal government discussions, it has been decided that Sweden will attempt to harness this power, the project being put in the hands of officer Nils Swedlund, aptly nicknamed 'Stora Bullret'. Already plans are being made to discover the power of the atom, either for peace or for war."

swedem.0.d:0 "Standing as the bulwark of conservatism in Sweden, the General Electoral League under Gösta Bagge has achieved a victory in the election. Seen as a somewhat unexpected victory due to Per Albin Hanssons rising popularity, it seems Bagge's response to the Black Monday crisis garnered enough trust to allow his party to achieve victory. Alongside this, support from their libertarian allies in the People’s Party under Gustaf Andersson has allowed Bagge to secure a majority of seats in the Riksdag, allowing them to hopefully pass bills and laws without too much objection from the Left. \n\nMoving forward, there is still much to do. While successful in their initial response to Black Monday, its economic effects are still hurting Sweden and fixing it has become the government's main goal moving forward."

swedem.1.t:0 "The General Electoral League sets out her objectives"
swedem.1.d:0 "The General Electoral league stands out as the mainline conservative party in Swedish politics, headed by the former admiral and later prime minister Lindman, it defines itself by its approach of mild corporatist economics with the view of protectionism while maintaining social cohesion and tradition. The party favours many voters from those who align with the current monarchy, labeling itself as the only true party to uphold the Crown’s position in its entirety. Gösta Bagge and his party now set out about fixing the issues they see plaguing Sweden, positioning Sweden onto the global stage either as a neutral factor focused on her own defence, becoming a part of one of the major factions playing their hand at international cooperation or secluding herself to her northern neighbours in a bid for Nordic unity. With this the party has formed an official coalition once more with the People’s Party, a staunchly classical liberal party that finds itself largely compatible with the Electoral league, such a relationship gives Bagge the needed seats to dominate the Riksdag, and place his party in a good position against the opposition."

Distinct cliques such as those aligning with the general Archibald Douglas who hold near ultranationalist sentiments, or those like Helge Jung who preside over a more traditionalist view exist, strengthening the conservative support base. \n\nWith these groups in mind, the government has made distinct outreaches of support via funding of the military apparatus in an obvious attempt to court the Army further into the current government. While aligning with the ultranationalists would cause mass political outcry from opposition and socialists alike, the more moderates in the Army will provide much needed stability through these turbulent times."

Strengthened by unwavering support from the Armed Forces and the continued success of a robust protectionist market, the League can finally bask in its well-earned triumph. What once seemed like an insurmountable challenge—competing against Hansson’s Social Democrats in the polls—has been decisively overcome. A crucial turning point came with the strategic alliance between Bagge’s Electoral League and Gustav Andersson’s market-liberal-aligned People’s Party. This partnership secured vital seats in the Riksdag, surpassing the threshold for a general majority and effectively granting the coalition the power to pass legislation with ease. With this newfound authority, sweeping economic and political reforms have been set in motion. Among the most significant changes is the introduction of a corporatist economic model, designed to further expand Sweden’s industrial base. By fostering closer collaboration between the government, businesses, and labor organizations, this system allows for smarter allocation of resources, more efficient urban planning, and the development of new industrial sectors. As a result, economic growth has accelerated, and the general quality of life for all Swedes has begun to improve. \n\nAgainst all odds, Bagge and his party have not only solidified their dominance in Swedish politics but also laid the foundation for a new era of prosperity and stability."

Currently led by isolationist proponent Gustaf Andersson, it aligns itself closely with the Electoral League and remains in a close coalition with her. However some of Andersson’s comments have taken a harsh stance against the 3rd Internationale governments and as such has caused strained relations in London and Paris. Using its coalition connection, the party allowed itself to come ahead in the election as its seats became vital for a majority in the Riksdag for Bagge’s conservatives. \n\nWith this victory, Andersson and his once minor party now have the chance to bring about true liberalism to Sweden, equality amongst the population and stability on the world stage."

While many of the larger farms in Sweden owned by wealthy individuals generally vote conservative, many smaller tend to vote towards either Hanssons social democratic party or the smaller Farmer’s League. The Farmer’s league sits comfortably near us politically, made to represent the more agrarian voter base, they hold economically liberal views while aligning progressively in terms of social policies. While we find them now and then at odds with us regarding social points, we find much common ground on the position of the economy. We may offer them a position in our coalition, conceding some of our power in turn to widen and broaden our support base, alongside expanding our seats in the Riksdag. Such a move would come with compromise, we will allow them to focus and improve areas based around farmers in Sweden, however our allies in the General Electoral League are unlikely to view such a move favourably and in turn some guarantees with them as well to maintain the coalition must be made. Or, we could simply ignore this smaller party, we already have the backing of the conservatives, so what would we need with a party of small farmers and agrarian? The choice is ours."

Following visionary liberals like Karl Staaff in 05’ who helped fight for voting rights, as well as the dedicated compromise politics of last liberal prime minister Nils Edén back in 1920, Sweden today stands strong and true, proud in its liberal values, with a people content with their caring state."

The coalition has confided in each other today to hold an internal vote on the place of corporatism in the coalition. One the right stands the hardline conservatives, favouring full formation of Swedish guilds across the nation alongside the forceful conversion of unions to government control. Due to their radical nature, the hardliners are unlikely to impose their view directly, however they have shown support for the moderates in an attempt to achieve some level of success. The moderates advocate for increased expenditure in Swedish guilds, indirectly forcing out non-Swedish guilds in favour of native ones. They allow for the establishment of trade unions under some rules of disallowing radicalism. \n\nOn the most skeptical side sit where the majority of the People’s Party sits, viewing the majority of corporatism as a net negative for the economy and as a betrayal of the free market model.

The party advocates for an increase in state welfare, equal shared rights and a relatively neutral foreign policy. Their golden egg is the Folkhemmet, brainstormed by Hansson himself, it envisions a ‘People’s Home’. An economic system using capitalism to its benefit to aid and help the people of Sweden. With heavy investments in the health sector as well as infrastructure improvement, the Folkhemmet aims to completely reforge Sweden into a social democratic bastion, the likes of which as not yet been observed elsewhere.With the nation still reeling from the economic turmoils of Black Monday, and the overshadowing view of the populace demanding results, Hansson has his work cut out for him."

Regardless of class or background, it espouses the notion of collective concern for all in Sweden, emphasizing solidarity. Redirecting the usual ideals of the abolishment of capitalism like many other more socialist governments, Hansson’s Folkhemmet seeks to humanise and improve capitalism through state intervention and cooperation between unions, businesses and the central government.\n\nThe most important aspect of this is the welfare plan, a national state welfare open to all citizens. Allowing for ease of access to healthcare, education and job opportunities. Seemingly seen as idealistic by Hansson’s opponents, him and his party are hopeful that such a plan can and will be made a reality."

Allowing us to attract wayward social liberals and centrists to our cause, disavowing such minor yet vocal radical elements in Sweden will go a long way in improving stability.\n\nAway with such radicals, Sweden’s crown shall foster hope and wealth for all beneath her gaze!"

Yet, somehow the SAP have achieved their goal, creating the uniquely Swedish ‘Folkhemmet’, or People’s Home. Alongside this economic miracle, political stability has once again returned to the Riksdag, with favourable debates and discussions allowed, creating a new sense of hope in the Swedish populace. Whether such a people's prioritised market can continue to exist in the long term surrounded by exploitative capitalists is unknown, but what is known is that the Swedish people are ready to stand and fight for their rights once more."

By improving their access to healthcare, education and social support, we can begin to eliminate the deep divisions that persist within our society.

However in recent years they’ve quickly slid towards the right as they directly oppose our policies of nationalization of some private businesses. While they remain firmly against any official form of coalition at this point in time, the Farmer’s league offers another moderate and more politically aligned party. Sitting as a somewhat unofficial coalition member with us, breaking against some of our policies deemed as too ‘socialist’, they remain generally well aligned with us. By formalizing an official coalition with them, we can broaden our government and expand our seats in the Riksdag while better hearing the needs of the smaller farms and farmers across Sweden."

However, within the Riksdag, a proposal has come forth, headed by Hansson and his Social democrats, a grand coalition between the Social democrats, Farmer’s league, Folkpartiet and the Conservatives to stabilize and safeguard Sweden during this crisis. While some believe such a move would simply ingrain the parties more under Hansson’s control, he claims it's merely to protect Sweden. The members of the Riksdag now consider this choice, as a fire rises over Europe."

swedem.27.d:0 "In a most unexpected turn today, former leader of the SSV, Karl Kilbom, has announced his resignation and enthusiasm to join the SAP. With such a move, Kilbom reforms himself, moving away from the political extremes of socialism and syndicalism, towards the more accepted social democratic principles. Whether he has any plans for a go at leadership of the SAP is uncertain, however if such a man can be brought back from the brink of radicalism, then anyone can!"

swedem.28.t:0 "The Flag we Hoist"
swedem.28.d:0 "Following the dissolution of the Swedish-Norwegian union in 1905, the flag of Sweden was changed to remove the Norwegian symbolism. Then in 1906, a light medium blue was adopted onto the flag, to represent the shift from Sweden as an imperial power to one of a model democratic state. However, with the winds of history forever shifting, some within the Riksdag and public wish to see a resurgence in the darker shade of blue once used. While the group is minor and such a change would do nothing for gain in the country, it remains a novel premise."
swedem.28.a:0 "A return to 1905!"
swedem.28.b:0 "We accept our current flag"

swedem.29.t:0 "The Decision on the Economic Direction of the Party"
swedem.29.d:0 "As the engines of progress thunders along, as government ministers and their subordinates struggle to formulate economic policies going forwards, an uncomfortable question has been raised. With most of our current economic planning based around modern Keynesian economics, but with most of our older party members still devoted to-if a bit conflicted-mainline Marxist economic policy, some have suggested that we take a step backwards, drop the capitalist pretence of Keynesian economics in favour of a more guiding hand in the economy, based around Marxist principles rather than capitalist exploitation. Rather than just keeping the few nationalized businesses under our belt, advocates of the Marxist position want us to go even further, to nationalize all major industry, all to maximize productivity, efficiency, and growth. In direct opposition, those following the Keynesian position suggest that mass-nationalization would simply kill Swedish ingenuity and industry, citing the numerous Swedish inventors and industrialists who-although oftentimes becoming filthy rich in the process-helped propel Sweden into a level of modernity rivaling-and sometimes exceeding-that of central Europe. Additionally, they claim that the Swedish economy works best when nobody rocks the boat, and if Keynesian economics has brought us this far, why change course now?"
swedem.29.a:0 "We shall re-embrace Marxism!"
swedem.29.b:0 "Stick to what works, Keynesian economics!"

swedem.30.t:0 "Handling Opposition"
swedem.30.d:0 "Opposition has always been a matter of fact in politics, even the vikings knew that. Although the government have come a long way from the old ways of settling things, be it by duel or by feats of martial strength, or arbitration at things, truth of the matter is that opposition, and indeed oppositionism, is a scourge in the Riksdag. More left leaning members refuse to cooperate with the more right leaning members, radicals refuse to work with centrists, and following the chaos in 36’, Swedish politics have returned to civility, though still deeply factionalist. As the Swedish government attempts to steer a new course ahead for the future, a policy must be formulated in order to force through reforms in the toxic Riksdag. One suggestion from the more moderate wings of the government, want to open for negotiation and discussion, and that rather than refusing to engage with those on the opposition, the government should proactively attempt to build bridges, to compromise, in order to bring over moderates from the other side, isolating the radicals in the process. This would speed up legislation, and hopefully in time reduce political tensions. Fittingly, those in opposition to this proposal on how to handle the opposition in the Riksdag suggest a completely different course. Arguing that the party and government would break their ties to the electorate by taking a compromising position, these radicals want the government to at least stay the course, force through legislation by any means necessary, hoping to court the electorate via staunch independent policies in order to eventually kill off any relevant opposition in the Riksdag in the process."

swedem.31.t:0 "To 'Free' Elections?"
swedem.31.d:0 "As Sweden recovers from the chaos of 36’, questions are raised on what the government will do next, in particular its positions towards future elections, and how to handle the insurgent left. In a declaration to the press, the assembled government set out their policy going forwards. ‘To preserve Swedish values and to maintain Swedish democracy, the government and the reassembled Riksdag have decided to hold new elections at a date decided later by vote. In this new election, voters will be able to vote for-’"

swedem.32.t:0 "A Return to the Ballots"
swedem.32.d:0 "Following the ‘coup that saved the country’ as the media calls it, Sweden is finally having its promised new elections. Although radicalism has been kept at bay with force of arms and a rather sentence-eager judicial system, the average Swede now puts his faith in the ballot box once again on what course his country will take. Radicals on the left refuse to engage in the electoral process they call a ‘sham’, the remnants of the SAP stagger to put up a fight under their new leader Tage Erlander, Bondeförbundet rises through the polls with an influx of politically aware farmers, Folkpartiet has embraced several disgruntled moderates from the SAP and eye the position of prime minister with eagerness, and the conservatives of the AV rightfully view the position as theirs for the taking. A dark horse option has emerged too, promising to keep socialism at bay, the National League, made up of officers and soldiers who think this whole election is once again putting the country at risk of socialist subversion."

However, another candidate, that of Tage Erlander. 15 years Hanssons junior, Erlander represents a younger face in the party, still a strong advocate for the party's model of Folkhemmet welfare. However a third, and more unorthodox choice has arisen, the former leader of the SSV in the 1936 elections, Karl Kilbom. Joining the Social democrats in 1938 after the failure of the SSV to gain traction, he has been proposed as the third, albeit radical, candidate for Sweden.

Militants apart from all facets of parties within the revolution have taken the current chaos to their advantage, solving and enacting revenge against old rivals. Looting sprees and large riots are now not uncommon in all cities and towns, as workers and militants take up arms against their perceived enemy. \n\nSome occurrences have reached the President where such groups enact vile acts of violence, against both innocent civilians and reactionary enemies. Such news has gone international, being labeled as the ‘Swedish Red Terror’, emphasized as the failures of the Revolution by reactionary nations, and being downplayed by those within the 3rd Internationale. \n\nWith this in mind, it has come down to the President to make a tough decision. Crackdown on such acts, possibly alienating the more radical and fanatical elements of the revolution. Or constrain perpetrators of the more severe acts committed while turning a blind eye to more minor grievances committed, or most drastic of all merely ignoring international outcry and allowing such mass actions of violence to continue."

swerev.0.t:0 "Hansson Is Dead!"
swerev.0.d:0 "Tragedy falls on the nation, as the would-be father of the modern nation and its first president has died. Shot by rogue agents of the military during the coup attempt, Per Albin Hansson leaves behind him a legacy of social justice and workers' struggle. Although pragmatic enough to be content with the monarchy, he was never inherently a supporter of the oppressive system, and following the demands from SSV in the last election, Per Albin Hansson gambled, formed a coalition, and the price he paid was with his life. Following his death, the social democrats as a force have effectively been radicalized overnight, and in an emergency session in the riksdag, in which parties deemed hostile to the republic were barred from participating, Karl Kilbom from the Paris Clique has been elected the new President.\n\nFollowing Kilbom's election the riksdag has been renamed, and the ban on parties hostile to the now unfolding revolution have been put into law. Kilbom himself knows that his position is merely interim, as an emergency congress has been called among the forces of the left to sort out a new proper leader, ranging from Kilbom himself to more radical alternatives like his former comrade Nils Flyg. Indeed, following the death of Hansson and Kilboms appointment as president, Flyg has gone on a rampage in the press and in mass demonstrations, calling not just for the heads of the counterrevolutionaries, but also directly for a forced removal of so called ‘false’ socialists from the riksdag, targeting his other former comrade Zeth ‘Zäta’ Höglund as a downright foreign agent. As it stands, fearing that his former comrade might come for him soon enough too, Kilbom has silently sent word back to Paris that, should he not be chosen as leader in the next emergency congress, He’d happily resume his position as leader of the Swedish delegation to the Internationale."

swerev.2.d:0 "While the idea of a clash between Swedes would seem nearly impossible a few years ago, the current political climate may now demand it. The growing army distrust of the socialist government is near boiling over, with the possibility of a coup now almost certain, workers are mobilising with what little weapons they have available to help the government fight against the army.

swerev.3.d:0 "The worst has come to pass. In the early hours of the morning, a large detachment of soldiers assembled in front of the Riksdag, their boots echoing ominously across the cobbled streets of Stockholm. At their head stood General Helge Jung, flanked by his trusted allies Carl August Ehrensvärd and Archibald Douglas. The time for veiled threats and tense negotiations had ended. They came to seize power.\n\nAs the soldiers formed ranks, a sudden commotion erupted nearby. Columns of worker militias emerged, some armed with stolen rifles and others wielding hunting weapons or tools converted into makeshift arms. These were not soldiers, but citizens prepared to defend what they saw as their revolution.\n\nFor a tense moment, silence reigned. The military presented its demands to the government: the immediate dissolution of the socialist administration, recognition of the army as the temporary ruling authority, and full disarmament of all worker-aligned militias. The response from Per Albin Hansson’s coalition was swift and defiant. His more radical allies outright rejected the demands, calling them treason.\n\nGunfire broke the stillness. A brutal clash followed in the very heart of the capital. Smoke and shouting filled the square, as the dreams of both sides collided in violence. When the fighting ceased and the last echoes of gunfire faded into the morning fog, a single cry pierced the silence. It signaled not just victory or defeat, but the beginning of a new chapter in Sweden’s turbulent history."

With the old guard swept away, Sweden stands at the threshold of a new era. The dreams of workers' rights, class liberation, and human dignity are no longer distant hopes, they are the guiding principles of a new society in the making.

Attacking political stations and harassing our efforts at establishing a true workers paradise. As such, drastic measures must be enacted, the creation of a ‘Red Guard’ modeled after those that fought in the Russian Civil war. These new guardsmen will aid in combating reactionary terrorists and enemies of the revolution, for their loyalty to the revolution is assured."
swerev.5.a:0 "Red covers Sweden now and forever!"

swerev.6.t:0 "A Red Riksdag"
swerev.6.d:0 "With the enemies of the revolution either imprisoned, destroyed, or driven beyond our borders, attention now turns inward—toward the emerging political landscape of a reborn Sweden. The once-unified revolutionary front, bound together by shared struggle, has begun to fracture as ideological rifts surface in the absence of a common foe. \n\nNew factions are beginning to take shape. The Socialists of the SSV, with their roots in the former electoral system, advocate for a structured socialist republic with popular representation. Opposing them are the mainline syndicalist anarchists, gaining momentum through support from the 3rd Internationale in both arms and ideology, envisioning a stateless, decentralized workers' order. Further still are the hardline national syndicalists and authoritarian communists, united only by their desire for a more militant, centralized revolutionary state.\n\nAs these groups organize and solidify their positions, a new election has been declared.

swerev.7.d:0 "Formed out of a split with the SAP decades ago, the SSV has faced many challenges. When the Russian revolution raged, the SSV took a firm stance in support of their cause, and when the revolution came to a tragic end, the party entered the ideological wilderness. Karl Kilbom, rising star in the party, clashed with fellow overachiever Sven Linderot, each taking different wings of the party under their control, Kilbom enthralled by syndicalism in the west, with Linderot seeking to remain committed to the cause of Petrograd style socialism. Eventually this split caused the party to enter a state of civil war, eventually leading to the expulsion of Linderot and his Leninists, who went on to form the SKP in direct opposition. Following this split the party has taken a more positive view of parliament and an electoral path to socialism, although naturally friendly towards the Third Internationale. With Kilbom spending the last few years abroad in Paris, leadership of the SSV was passed on to Höglund and the well known writer Karin Boye, though the party has remained primarily controlled from the Swedish delegation in Paris. Now however, the party faces another challenge in its short, strange life. Not only facing a leadership crisis as Kilbom and Boye both desire the position, former alliances have ended too. Having only agreed to a coalition with the SAP to achieve electoral victory, the party has cut all ties once more with the old mother-party, aiming to take a new truly independent path in the cause of Swedish socialism, free of bourgeois influence. Although intending to maintain the parliamentarian system and taking the position as a mass block party home to different political tendencies, the SSV has some clearly defined goals. They seek the proletarianization of the middle class while also uplifting the working class to a higher status, improving both working conditions and pay for all in Sweden, and ending the vice of gambling. \n\nBelieving in a strong cooperation between the small farmers, croppers, tenants and workers, the party aims to create a liberation of agricultural people from capitalist exploitation and oppression. Aside from these, they also hold the position of a statutory ban on drinking. \n\nThey remain as the largest party in terms of active members, giving them a solid chance at yet another electoral victory, albeit within a very different looking Riksdag."

The party sits two headed as of now, one represented by Severin who advocates for a centralised syndicalist model, herelding away from the regular anarchist views, he believes a strong state backed by the unions is the only way for Sweden’s workers to prosper. \n\nThe other head is led by Elise Ottesen-Jensen, seen as the most mainline of the two, her group is best known for the organizations of the most major strikes across the nation, being the most influential group in bringing about the revolution. She maintains the anarchist history of syndicalism, where the workers call to action is the priority of the party, to overthrow and denounce tyrants and despots alike.Holding ties to both Norwegian and Danish trade unions, holding the view of limited government intervention, it deems the purpose of such a body is merely to maintain workers rights and further the international revolution. Seeing a united international revolution as their final goal, they hold big dreams of spreading their ideals outward. \n\nIn a heated debate, Severin and Ottesen-Jensen have come out to demand leadership of the Union, with it simply now in the hands of the members to decide the fate of leadership."

Although it is certain that his block will explode if he ever gets into power, all Flyg needs is a toehold into power, at which point he can easily dispatch any unruly rival.

With policies of worker freedom’s, pay and generally uplifting the working class, they now hold the power to commit to such ideals. Alongside these, the party also hopes to enact some form of prohibition in Sweden, reminiscing back to the Alcohol referendum in 1922."

swerev.12.t:0 "Question of Party Leadership"
swerev.12.d:0 "Born in Göteborg, Karin Boye initially had plans of becoming a school teacher, writing poems and translating T.S Eliot's works into Swedish. In her stay in Uppsala, she would eventually join a socialist students organisation known as the Swedish Clarté League. During this time she would win the Nordic Nobel prize for her book ‘Astarte’, a criticism of bourgeois culture and society. While suffering from bouts of depression in the early 1930s, she would eventually meet her partner, whom she referred to as her wife, Margot Hanel. Boye would become more involved in the political sphere following this while maintaining a job as a school teacher. After a few years of political engagement in SSV, in the last few years she’s been prepared for leadership by the late Zeth Höglund, believing that the movement needed a more female edge. While Kilbom was engaged in politics abroad, Boye and her pseudo-mentor Höglund have been hard at work expanding the party, with Boye’s family connections as well as her cultural influence allowing the party to make inroads into the urban bourgeoisie. Boye represents a more moderate side of the party, forgoing all tyranny and authoritarianism where it may present itself, while also garnering large support from the women and the left leaning urban middle class of Sweden. \n\nKarl Kilbom was born and raised into a working class family in Sweden, attending an event headed by a socialist agitator at age 15, in which he would go on to help in the formation of a socialist club. However, threatened by company spies, Kilbom would temporarily revoke the socialist club and its ideals to save his family’s jobs. Conscripted into the Swedish navy in 1907, he would begin to continue joining and participating in socialist and social democrat clubs wherever possible. Eventually joining the Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden who supported the Bolsheviks throughout the Russian civil war. While initially supporting Communism, with their defeat, he would turn away from the ideology and swivel between groups like the syndicalists and the social democrats. After a fateful visit to Paris during the heyday of the revolution, Kilbom and his compatriots and fellow socialists Nils Flyg and Zeth Höglund formed an informal association, later becoming known as the Paris Clique due to their fascination with-and connection with-affairs in Paris. Part of the Swedish delegation to the Internationale, Kilbom has spent several years engrossing himself in international revolutionary struggles, taking part in several committees regarding fostering socialism in Scandinavia. Although Höglund and Flyg have been active in Sweden proper for quite some time, Kilbom's return from Paris to assume control over SSV has made him a giant on the left, but not an unchallenged one. Although friendly to syndicalism, indeed downright favourable to syndicalists worldwide, Kilbom does not believe that Sweden is industrialized enough for nation scale syndicalisation. More radical than Boye, but more pragmatic and reformist than the SAC or the growingly unstable Flyg, Kilbom like Boye wants socialism in Sweden, but ideally without any further bloodshed. Refusing to fall into moderation alongside the remnants of the SAP Karl Kilbom would maintain the party's more revolutionary ideals to keep its independence from the more moderate SAP. Holding staunch revolutionary and socialist ideals, the party remains firm in avoiding any form of authoritarianism."

The Swedish people are strong, their support unwavering. Our nation, once shackled by royalism and capitalist greed, has emerged as a beacon of socialist success. Sweden is no longer just a country, it is proof that a socialist government can thrive. \n\nAs the Red North rises, Sweden will stand as a symbol to the world—a thriving, independent nation where the people come first, and where socialism is no longer a dream, but a reality."

These principles have never been sworn away by the party, however with the chaos of the revolution finally at an end, the question has arisen once more. Although the referendum on prohibition in 1922 resulted in a narrow defeat, maintaining the status quo on the sale and licensing of alcohol in Sweden, with the dethroning of the monarchy and radical reforms of the SSV while in charge, the possibility of reintroducing prohibition has sprung up.\n\nPut out as a new referendum, the party will adhere to whatever choice the public makes, whether to once again maintain their status quo or go along the arduous task of prohibition, should they decide that a nationwide prohibition will be enacted under the SSV."

The small minor group initially started by students is dedicated to advocating for left issues and striving towards a better understanding of what modern socialism entails. With a broad membership and decidedly left but without any party strings, Clarté is an association worth embracing, supporting, and helping. \n\nSimilarly to this, another group called the Nya Idun, which was established in 1885 deserves our attention. Serving as the women’s version of the men-only Sällskapet Idun, it advocates for the counterpart to the men's motto of ‘men living in Stockholm who have their own activities and interests in science, literature and art in various fields’. Sitting itself as a feminist forward group to discuss various topics of literature, arts and political views, it is surely a good organisation to be friendly towards.

None more popular than the former SAP member, Ernst Wigforss. Initially representing the Social Democrats in Gothenburg in 1919, he was later appointed as a member of Hjalmar Branting’s third cabinet which further cemented his popularity in the Social Democrat party. In these years, he has made numerous writings and papers on the ideas of a Worker’s Industrial democracy and most importantly, Guild Socialism. An ideology originating from Britain, it advocates for workers’ control of industry through ‘guilds’. An ideology that Wigforss has fostered within Sweden the better part of a decade. As such, he has offered his direct services, wanting to bring about this new Guildism in Sweden, in hopes to truly bind the workers to their labour, in the ultimate fusion of socialism. Although, some within our own party are still wary of these former moderates, condemning them as still loyalists to the old monarchy.\n\nWhile we have given the olive branch to many of our former coalition allies, shall we extend it to Wigforss or keep him out of government?"

Yet no government has ever confirmed his arrival, leaving his fate clouded in uncertainty.\n\nNow, however, new whispers have begun to spread through Sweden and Finland alike. These rumors do not speak of safe havens in Helsinki, Moscow, or Ottawa, but rather of the far reaches of Asia. They tell of Mannerheim retracing the steps of his youth, back when he served as an officer of the Tsarist Empire and wandered the remote frontiers of the world. During that fabled expedition, he crossed deserts and mountains, reached the heights of Tibet, and became one of the first Europeans to meet the Dalai Lama himself.\n\nIf the stories are to be believed, Mannerheim has once more embraced that distant past. Some claim he now rides with nomads across the endless Mongolian steppes, others that he hides among the monasteries of Tibet, or that he has made his way into the fractured Chinese province of Shanxi, living quietly under an assumed name. Whether these tales are the idle inventions of drunkards or the kernels of truth, none can say.\n\nWhat is certain is that Mannerheim has vanished from Europe, perhaps forever. His shadow will linger in Swedish and Finnish memory for generations, whether as a soldier, a wanderer, or a ghost of empires long dead."

Their banners still fly over parts of Stockholm and Göteborg, and their calls for a decentralised, leaderless revolution continue to draw crowds. While they lack the unity or strength to seize control outright, their numbers and influence make them more than a passing nuisance. If left unchecked, they could stall or fracture the progress we have fought to achieve.

Many of their syndicates have been absorbed into state-backed unions, while their more uncompromising leaders have faded into irrelevance or gone underground. The streets that once echoed with uncoordinated protests now hum with the steady rhythm of centralised organisation. Although some cells may still linger in the shadows, the revolutionary government has secured its authority and ensured that the anarchist threat will never again challenge the unity of the state."

Among these is Nils Flyg and his National Syndicalist bloc, a group notorious for its rowdy street militias and thuggish enforcers. While their discipline on the battlefield is undeniable, their methods in the streets often verge on intimidation and outright violence.\n\nTheir ideology remains far from our own, yet their hostility toward anarchists and foreign influence makes them a temporary, if uneasy, partner. Through discreet negotiations and careful promises, Flyg is persuaded to direct his movement toward stabilising the nation rather than opposing the government. He and his followers will not receive positions of real authority, but they will be allowed a limited voice in certain industrial committees and security matters. For now, this uneasy truce keeps another potential enemy from opening a new front against the revolution."

With this advent of chaos however, many lowlifes and criminals have begun to erupt in their behaviour. Looting, robbing and hurting our innocent populace who wish only to go about their daily lives in peace. As such, a new force, designated to serve the Riksdag only shall be created to both keep the peace and bring justice to the unruly. With the creation of such a force however, its national funding remains with much speculation, shall the government give it ample funding to organise itself in defending the nation or shall it receive a vast pay increase in an effort to keep peace as much as possible. A third option does present itself, Nils Flyg has offered to aid us further by putting his men in the position of this new force, bringing about their ruthless and ferocious rhetoric down on our enemies.

The charter speaks of syndicates in every field and factory, of rural communes united in solidarity, and of a people no longer ruled, by ruling themselves. It denounces imperialist aggression and bourgeois democracies, affirming our support for a global revolution of the working class. From Malmö to Kiruna, every Swede shall know, they are no longer subjects but free men and women. \n\nTo our comrades abroad, this Charter is a beacon of solidarity.

The rural heart of Sweden, long ignored by monarchs and capitalists alike, must now be organized.\n\nTo do this, we shall establish agricultural syndicates, unions built by and for farmers, guided by the same democratic principles that drive our urban movements. These syndicates will give rural workers the means to voice their struggles and receive real, responsive support from our government. Land, labor, and livelihood will no longer be dictated from above, but shaped by those who till the soil.

swerev.40.d:0 "Born Johan Fridolf Johansson in June 1897 among the statare in Uppland, Jan Fridegård’s childhood was shaped by poverty and constant labour. His father worked as a foreman in the barns at Katrinedal manor and the family moved frequently across estates seeking work. From the age of seven he tended cattle and by fourteen took over milking duties. At eighteen he joined the Life Regiment cavalry, serving three hard years before returning to civilian struggles. His earliest poems appeared in local papers by the mid-1920s and his debut collection Den svarta lutan was published in 1931. In 1933 his first novel En natt i juli followed. In 1930 he adopted the pen-name Jan Fridegård, distancing himself from earlier aliases like Fride Johansson and Johan Magerman, as he began to win recognition for writing that spoke plainly of social injustice and the lives of the dispossessed. \n\nHowever, with the advent of revolution, his leanings towards Syndicalism grew more potent, as he actively participated in Syndicalist demonstrations and riots during the Armies failed counter-revolution. Now he has arrived at the Workers’ Riksdag, not just as a writer but as a man willing to help the administration as best he can. Already fawned over by many in the public for his previous writings, we can simply give him the funds to continue writing, propping up a truly Syndicalist writer with skill, or the more radical route of inviting him directly into government. Allowing him to bring about his more Utopian ideals of Syndicalism into the forefront.\n\nWhat shall we do with such a man?"

swerev.41.d:0 "If strike action is the physical manifestation of the workers power, then Arbetaren is the literary form of said action. Printed in bulk in Örebro and written in Stockholm under the guidance of both SAC proper as well as its firebrand lead editor Frans Severin, Arbetaren has seen a meteoric rise throughout the last decade. Originally named ‘Syndikalisten’, the name ‘Arbetaren’ was chosen to appeal to a broader demographic, though nevertheless arguing the case for workers rights, the value of organising in syndicates, as well as championing views ranging from the more orthodox to the more anarchistic. Staunchly independent, the paper has published pieces on everyone from the right to the left. Nils Flyg would call himself a socialist, but Arbetaren accuses him of having betrayed the cause in favour of Totalist dogma. Lindholm is described as being a loutish wolf in sheep's clothing, and even Per Albin Hansson with his SAP and LO alliance is framed as an agent of capitalist reaction. Regardless of their hit pieces however, Arbetaren works hard to present the plight of the worker to the rest of Swedish society. Found wherever there’s an active strike, found on barricades and in student associations, Arbetaren has a broad appeal to those who loathe the modern capitalist world and yearn for something else, free of oppression, free of overbearing state power, free of exploitation."

swerev.42.d:0 "Following the workers uprising and the complete collapse of SAP as a party, Landsorganisationen, the block organisation of worker unions hitherto connected to the defunct party, has been cast adrift. As most organisations formerly aligned with SAP have begun to transform into loyal followers of the SSV, many believed that LO would soon follow. However, following a gathering of LO leaders at the ‘LO-Castle’ in central Stockholm, the grand organisation has splintered, its many unions scurrying off to various benefactors, with LO itself now only housing around half of its original unions. The reason for this split came from a contentious vote wherein the LO had to decide if it was to align with the SAC-its former opponents-or the SSV. Following the vote resulting in a victory for those friendly with the SAC, unions refusing to work with the syndicalists split off, joining the burgeoning block of smaller unions aligned with the SSV. \n\nFollowing the explosion within the leadership of LO, the centralist wing of SAC have gladly invited their former opponents into the fold, eager to begin the transformation of LO into a syndicalist sister block. This has however been viewed with suspicion from the more radical anarchist wing of the SAC, who believe that LO is still just a force of yellow unions, barely even dyed red. Hostile to their former rivals, the anarchists argue that this new influx of pseudo-syndicalists will only harm the movement and the purity of the SAC, with worries that the SAC will become a degenerated capitalist instrument if not kept clean. Regardless, the centralists under Frans Severin have begun the hard work of socialising and syndicalising the unions under the LO umbrella."

swerev.43.d:0 "An uncomfortable truth in the current Anarcho-Syndicalist Sweden, is that Ottosen-Jensen herself, while espousing freedom loving views in most things, is accused by many within the movement of not having the right properties for the job. Not only is she already a major mover within RFSU, and spends much time working on achieving gender equality, she's heavily criticized for her stance on sterilization, believing that some people are either unfit or unwell and should be prevented from having children. While that position has been the overarching consensus within the Riksdag since the introduction of the sterilization law in 1934, it is a deeply unpopular policy in wider society, not to mention within the urban proletariat, where families fear the government arbitrarily or otherwise deciding them unfit, and having the mother or father subsequently sterilized. As such, because of the sterilization question and the fact that Ottosen-Jensen is accused of having dual loyalties to the Anarchist cause, a rival has emerged within the wider movement in the form of Nils Lätt. /n/nNils Lätt, known to friends simply as 'Nisse', is an anarchist, trade unionist and sailor who has travelled the oceans for more than a decade, having brushed shoulders with almost all peoples of the Atlantic, and long having fought against oppression and tyranny. Originally excited by the prospect of the Russian revolution, the descent into civil war and subsequent Bolshevik bloodbath drove Lätt away, instead being enticed by Syndicalism, in particular syndicalism espoused in Catalonia and the Basque country. Taking to heart the ideals of a well-learned worker, Lätt is well-read and speaks different languages, even dabbling in Esperanto on the side as a treat. During the time of the rising in Stockholm Nils Lätt became an elected leader within the Red Guards, and successfully operated against agents of reaction, becoming a prominent figure in the now more militant Swedish left. While critics accuse Lätt of being a revolutionary bandit, as opposed to the more diplomatic and class-cooperative Ottosen-Jensen, he has nevertheless been raised as a challenger to her position, something which must be put to a vote."

swerev.44.d:0 "First presented as a law in the 1920's by the SAP, and later clarified and tweaked as a law by the AV in 1934, the Sterilization law is a very divisive one in Swedish society. First created as a way to allow and mandate the sterilization of the infirm, the mentally challenged and other disabled individuals, the law was expanded in 1934 to also factor in those who were deemed antisocial, as well as those deemed 'unfit' to have children. Men and Women, even underaged, have been and are still being sterilized often without their knowledge or their will, and indeed, various social systems in the burgeoning welfare state are as such very distrusted. A single mother runs the risk of being accused of being 'unfit' to have her own children, and can be sterilized if she ever decides to have an abortion. Someone put in a mental asylum, be it temporary or for a long period, or a child being put in an orphanage, also similarly run the risk of sterilization, always with the decision made by a doctor, rather than family or legal guardian. 'Tattare', slang for romani or simply travelling families in general, already run the risk of having their children taken from them, even having said children sterilized against their will, something that - when leaked to the press by said family - caused massive outrage. n/n/ Intended by the Riksdag as a way to keep the Swedish 'tribe' clean from defects, and to prevent children being raised with poor morals, this eugenicist law is widely hated. Although consensus within the Riksdag on all sides, left right and center, meant the law would never be abolished any time soon, the truth is that the proletariat and the poor as a whole absolutely despise it, with terrifying tales of random government agents showing up, deeming their homes 'unfit for children', and subsequently having children removed and parents sterilized as a result. Now, following the revolution, outcry from the proletariat and various anarchist groups have demanded a referendum be put on the abolishment of the law, citing it to be not just racist, eugenicist and downright evil, as abuses have indeed been committed, and that the law was evil from the outset. Now, in the spirit of the revolution, the law will be put to the people."

All peoples of the world must be united under the socialist cause, all peoples must be emancipated, and it must be done via friendly cooperation rather than full on coercion. Although most thinkers in the party believe that the best way to achieve this is via the Comintern, via cooperation with different communist parties throughout the world, a new strain propagated by Linderot propose that maybe, rather than just cooperation, all the communist parties in Europe itself could unite into one, to form one massive European Union of Socialist Republics, the EUSR. Although a pipedream to most, the groundwork for such cooperation has already been laid in the works of the Internationale and the aforementioned Comintern, not to mention the attempts prior to the weltkrieg of uniting the proletariat behind a position of pacificism, peace among men, and equality. Perhaps if things go further, if the revolution is secured and there’s a chance to spread it, the idea of a united Europe will be within the realm of possibility. In contrast to Linderot who wants a union of all Europe, his second in command Hugo Sillén advocates for something else entirely. The proletariat in Europe is lost, instead, together with the RKP the SKP should advance eastwards, to form a union west of the Urals. Although a ludicrous idea, is it really that outrageous? Sillén thinks his idea is valid, but Linderot has accused him of oppositionism and obstructionism."

Still, inspired by the writings of Kalergi and statements by the totalist Oswald Mosley, Per Engdahl has proposed once again that the different nations of Europe should unite into one, a pure European state without hostile elements such as Jews, Romani, reactionaries, capitalists, consumerism, and a whole list of other things and peoples. Although Per Engdahl is not politically aligned with Sven Olov Lindholm beyond a shared sense of nationalism and friendly relations, relations that have so far kept Engdahl from facing the wall, his ideas have nevertheless influenced Sven Olov Lindholm to a certain degree. If Europe was to unite to become a totalist union of peoples cultures under shared values and beliefs, who could possibly stop it? Americans are slaves to consumerism and anglo-saxon capitalist rot, Slavs have fallen into a state of profound reaction, and the peoples of Africa and Asia are chained to imperialists, both capitalist and feudal. Perhaps, if one dares to dream, a totalist Europe could unite the entire world."

Following material dialectics closely, Nils Flyg has proposed something dubbed by his followers as the ‘Gothic Imperative’ namely that Germanic countries have a debt to history to become socialist, in order to lead the world into a red bright future. Pointing out the failure of the Bolsheviks in Russia, as well as the growing pseudo-capitalist tendencies of what Nils Flyg calls the "Bourgeois Internationale”, Flyg presents a curious, if a bit ludicrous thesis: Since the Germanic world is overwhelmingly industrialized, has a large urban proletariat, it is the historical duty, debt, and objective of the Germanic world to become socialist and thus spread abroad. The Germanic world must unite under one banner, one shared ideal of proletarian emancipation, to destroy the Anglo Slavic capitalist Gog and Maggog. According to Nils Flyg, all Germanic peoples must unite to save the world, and that if Germany itself was to turn red, its emperor deposed, it would become a socialist bulwark so strong no nation could oppose it.

Zeth Höglund, important socialist and SSV party leader, has been tried, found guilty, and killed on the same day by a supposed ‘Revolutionary Tribunal’, a tribunal formed with the consent of Nils Flyg and his cronies. n/n/Early in the morning, while leaving his apartment to meet with a German exile, Zeth Höglund was arrested by a group of mutinous soldiers, ostensibly calling themselves Rödgardister, or Red Guards. Zeth Höglund was taken across Stockholm into the derelict Strömbadet bathhouse, the deconstruction of which having been postponed due to the revolution. Once inside, and forced before a supposed tribunal consisting of Nils Flyg, Agaton Blom, Arvid Olsson and Anton Nilson. Before the tribunal, Nils Flyg accused his former friend and party comrade Zeth Höglund of having conspired with foreign agents, citing the attempt by Höglund to meet with the German exile, called by Flyg a German spy. Citing also the inability of the tribunal to arrest this German contact, Flyg used that as an additional point that proved the subversive and secretive element of Höglund’s German connection. Citing the extraordinary circumstances besetting Stockholm, such as army units engaged in active battles in barracks against workers militias, Flyg suggested that Höglund was in fact simply an imperialist puppet, a white sheep merely wearing dyed red wool, and argued that Höglund be shot, or at least arrested. The fact that the tribunal had been arranged by Flyg was apparent and blatant. Not only were Agaton Blom and Arvid Olsson both members of Flyg’s party, but Arvid Nilson, famed revolutionary, was only there to legitimize the otherwise tiny tribunal, and was uncomfortable throughout. Despite Höglund's pleas and claims to the contrary, The tribunal voted for his death, with Nilson protesting profusely, being forced out of the meeting as the misscarriage of justice was carried out. n/n/The German who Höglund was intending to meet, Carl von Ossietzky, was in fact a journalist, having gone underground the moment he noticed Höglund failed to show for their meeting. When the red guards knocked on the door and stormed his room, von Ossietzky was already on the other side of town, attempting to seek shelter with members of the SSV. Unwilling or unable to arrest Flyg and his cronies despite the murder of a true socialist, Flyg has spent the day arguing that Höglund was a traitor to the socialist cause that simply had to be killed, and as the government deals with the fallout of Hansson's assasination and the complete collapse of the state apparatus, it’s likely Flyg won't see justice any time soon."

His followers, often described as thuggish enforcers rather than statesmen, see themselves as the vanguard of a new Sweden, determined to crush decadence and disunity wherever it appears. \n\nFlyg himself, a fiery orator and tireless agitator, now faces the daunting task of turning radical promises into lasting rule. Though his movement remains small compared to the larger syndicalist currents, he does not stand entirely alone. Sven Linderot’s Communists, still clinging to the doctrines of old Bolshevism, have offered their backing, believing Flyg to be the best chance at securing a strong central authority. Even Sven Olov Lindholm’s fanatical Swedish Socialist Gathering, despite their reputation as extreme and often contradictory radicals, have thrown their support behind Flyg. \n\nWith allies from across the fractured revolutionary spectrum, Nils Flyg now stands at the head of a fragile but formidable coalition.

To them, the revolution must be purified through ruthless action against “weak-hearted” elements, and any tolerance for dissent is seen as betrayal. Their paramilitary followers mutter openly that Flyg risks squandering the chance to forge a truly radical new order.\n\nCaught between two uncompromising allies, Flyg must walk a dangerous line.

Meanwhile, the Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation, long a bastion of anarchist thought, has been broken apart. Its most uncompromising anarchists vanish from public view, while its more centralist members are courted and folded into the Sveriges Nationalsyndikalistiska Parti, giving the SNSP new strength.\n\nEvery week the chamber grows quieter, fewer voices daring to challenge the direction set by Flyg.

Whispers within the movement suggest that certain so-called allies were never truly loyal to the revolution. Sven Lindholm, once tolerated for his zeal, has been exposed for maintaining secret contacts with former monarchist generals, including Archibald Douglas himself. Birger Furugård, meanwhile, has turned increasingly toward dangerous racial theories and bitter nationalism, openly hostile to the syndicalist order. Konrad Hallgren, once hidden from sight, is suspected of rebuilding militant networks of his own.\n\nTo confront these threats, Flyg has quietly unleashed the Folkets Nationella Säkerhetspolis, the FNS. Their work is silent, their methods unseen, and their results undeniable: investigations vanish into darkness, trials never surface, and names once spoken in parliament fade into nothing. Even loyal comrades now glance over their shoulders, fearful of a knock on the door. The purge has begun, and it will not stop until every hidden enemy has been erased."

For too long, the minds of Swedes have been bound by superstition, first through the blood-soaked rites of Norse paganism and later through the long, grim shadow cast by Christianity. From the moment the cross was hoisted above our temples and altars, a darkness fell across Sweden, a darkness of submission, guilt, and blind obedience to invisible masters. \n\nBut no longer. The age of divine lies is ending. \n\nThough many still cling desperately to these irrational beliefs, nurtured by generations of indoctrination and fear, the time has come to begin the great therapy of truth. Religion is the opioid of a dying world—a crutch for the weak, a tool for the exploiters—and we shall see it cast down, broken and discredited. The revolution has no place for fairy tales and ghosts; its altar is reason, and its scripture is strength. \n\nThis will not be an easy struggle. The parasite of faith has deep roots. But we know the path is righteous, and we do not waver. Through education, through will, through the ceaseless flame of ideological clarity, we shall purge the final vestiges of religious delusion from our people. In the end, no Swede shall bow to heaven, nor to prophets, nor to gods. They shall bow only to the Revolution—and to the Chairman, the living embodiment of Sweden’s destiny!"

From suppressing unionists and rioters before they even walk out onto the street, to smoking out the most well hidden terrorists hiding amongst the hills of Lappland, no part of Sweden has gone without search. With such a feat now accomplished, Flyg has been able to announce to the Swedish people that safety is back once more, that the success of the FNS and his policies have cured Sweden of her many ailments. But with such success, must come weariness, for even now the nation cannot relax. While internal threats may have vanished under great effort, foreign threats still remain, from spies and moguls from the Reichspakt, to the far looming reactionaries in the Entente and the vast titan that is the Russian bear to the East, Sweden must remain vigilant. With that, the FNS now turn their sights outward, being prepped and prepared to hide amongst our enemies, so Flyg and Sweden may always stay one step ahead."

Under the visionary leadership of Nils Flyg, Sweden has been purified of capitalist rot, has stamped out bureaucratic inaction and anarchist obstructionism, even putting the play-pretend bolsheviks in their grave in the process. Like the run rising over the land, socialism has triumphed, the vermins of the opposition scurrying away to hide in the dark. To his followers, Flyg is viewed as a visionary, a heroic revolutionary figure akin to Robespierre or Marat, dedicated to the cause above all, sacrificing his health, his family, his very being to the cause. To his opponents, Flyg has shrouded Sweden in darkness for generations to come, who will do anything to achieve a socialism so perverted it has little in common with any Marxist strain. "

For decades Linderot has worked in both Riksdag and abroad, in party meetings and in newspaper offices, solely for the cause of socialism, a socialism most by now have sadly forgotten. Linderot is a true socialist fighter. In 1919 he broke the blockade around Soviet Russia by forcing through the ship Eskilstuna III, serving as second hand on the bridge during the act of brotherly international love. To say that Linderot, or ‘Sven-Lasse’ as he is amicably called by the press, has major plans for Sweden would be an understatement. Although keen to cooperate with fellow socialists across the board to achieve a Swedish bolshevik inspired revolution, Linderot faces opposition from within his own party, not to mention the reactionaries skulking around in the forests, plotting his downfall. Linderot believes that Sweden can become a beacon of internationalism and socialism in the far north, and if push comes to shove, spread it abroad if it comes to it. With Lenin as his guide, Linderot will achieve true socialism, or die trying. "

With many members still holding their allegiances to the SSV, SAC and the remaining Flyg fanatics, finding a way to control the opposition is paramount to regaining stability under Communism. As such, the well versed and ardent Communist Hugo Sillén, currently Linderot’s right hand man of internal security, has requested increased powers over the Riksdag. Giving him the power to ‘persuade’ those within the other parties to join and assimilate themselves into the SKP. With promises of quiet and less public meetings with such ministers, the idea presents itself as both effective but rather dictatorial. Leaving Hugo Sillén in his current position would cause a slower integration of the other parties while limiting the firebrands' powers within the RIksdag. It would also allow him more time in his other duties of guarding Nils Flyg, who is currently on house arrest. A decision must now be made, promote Sillén to guarantee compliance or restrain the leashed dog to his current parameters?"

Linderot, eager to work alongside other socialists of various strains to build a socialist bulwark to achieve socialism at home, has long been opposed to the slavish attitude of Sillén, who remains deeply connected with the RKP. Sillén, either due to his own conviction or outside influence, believes that having a broad front would harm the cause of socialism, would kill the party’s revolutionary vigour, and turn Sweden into a crypto-capitalist syndicalist cesspool as the one in Paris. Sillén, having clashed with Linderot often over accusations of being tardy and lacking revolutionary ferocity, has suddenly become a new man throughout this new debate, accusing his former comrade of betraying the revolution with his moderate sensibilities. As the rivalry grows, the party has decided to hold an internal vote, to finally settle the matter. Following the principle of democratic centralism, the loser will be forced to follow the result of the vote, the victor triumphant. Linderot stands for the ‘Broad’ faction, arguing that socialism can only be achieved with support from more socialists than just the communist party itself. Sillén stands for the ‘Narrow’ faction, wanting the party and the nation to be unsullied by outside strains, corrupted by capitalist intrigue."

With his determination to expand the revolutionary circle within the Riksdag, a failed bid at expanding the already small Communist movement, Linderot merely opened himself up to Hugo Sillen’s grab for power.\n\nNow with a laundry list of crimes, ranging from secretly meeting with counter-revolutionaries and colluding with former social democrats, Hugo spared Linderot no mercy in the facade of a trail he faced. Now he faces execution, murdered behind the very building he helped build up from rubble, by the very man that stood by his side.\n\nHugo Sillen, now with an iron fist over the Workers’ Riksdag, has used Sven Linderot as an example of reformism, and those who follow it, their eventual fate.

Loyal men and women to the revolution rose up and defended her from the reactionary tyrants, however in such times not all goes to plan. In the towns and villages, innocent civilians and families were hurt or had their belongings wrongfully stolen from them. \n\nWhen the red terror was at its peak, as revolutionaries rightfully fulfilled justice against the monarchists and capitalists, many of the innocent bystanders in the middle were hurt. As such, the problem of how to handle those affected worse off by the Red terror has arisen, with many in the party believing some financial aid and formal apologies from the party will be enough to draw those disenfranchised back to our cause. Others believe that such a move will be seen as nothing more than the bare minimum, further pushing the already disenfranchised citizens into opposition to our government. Only by making a full commitment to restore what they lost with major financial compensation for what was taken, alongside official public apologies from the government, will we be able to bring back these hurt members of society. Although some of the hardliners within the party see this move as an act of cowardice, by giving in to the people's smallest demands, we will be seen as more of a charity than a government.\n\nThe decision now lies within the hands of the most upper echelons of the Swedish Socialist State, Sven Linderot."

The government has announced the transition from private landholding to a fully collectivized agricultural system, where farms will be merged into large, state-directed units, managed by elected committees under Party oversight.\n\nSupporters hail this as the final blow against the rural bourgeoisie and the lingering feudal habits of the countryside. They envision a future where tractors replace oxen, where mechanization and scientific planning end hunger forever, and where the grain and dairy of Sweden flow freely to feed both the worker in the factory and the soldier on the frontier.\n\nYet the scale of this transformation is immense, and the risks are real. A harsh and rapid program would seize all farmland at once, breaking resistance decisively but risking disruption to planting and harvest cycles. Such disruption could leave rural communities facing hunger before the system stabilizes. Even a moderate pace, though more measured, may still see local shortages as old ways are dismantled. Only the mildest approach, encouraging voluntary cooperatives, offers a near guarantee of steady food supplies, although it risks leaving large parts of the countryside outside the Party’s full control.\n\The Central Committee must now decide how far and how fast the revolution in agriculture will go."

With the capitalist press spreading lies about bolshevik atrocities, printing false accounts of famine and horror, the Swedish proletariat were led astray from the truest form of socialism yet attempted, done with the tacit support of the capitalists in the SAP. Now however, after years of hard work at home and abroad, and after taking power relatively bloodlessly, the cause of Swedish communism is growing once more. Schoolchildren study with full bellies, hospitals are built and staffed with competent and eager workers, and the welfare system-once a tool for bourgeois suppression of the proletariat's consciousness, has been turned into a system for the people, by the people, with the party. By inviting people into the party, workers, students and the remaining former bourgeois intelligentsia, the Swedish communist party has finally triumphed in reigniting the spirit of communism, purged from syndicalism and capitalism perversion."

swerev.74.t:0 "Our Origins in Petrograd"
swerev.74.d:0 "The defining moment of Swedish communism was found abroad, in the fire of the bolshevik revolution. By toppling the corrupt regime of Kerensky and forcing the mensheviks into the flames, Lenin and his revolutionary cadre went about transforming society by bullet rather than by ballot, forming soviets, councils, where workers and peasants could truly be represented. Taking inspiration from this, the Swedish communist party has long walked in step with the RKP, even when the bolsheviks had to flee Russia for Paris. Linderot, who bravely stormed the blockade around Petrograd, formed ties with the RKP early on, meeting almost everyone in the Russian bolshevik sphere, much like Hugo Sillén. Sillén first came into contact with the RKP by writing socialist articles and protesting on the streets, forming the communist youth movement in Sweden in the process. It was via this activity that Sillén first came to meet Lenin, an impression that left a permanent memory in the young revolutionary, and once Lenin was tragically assassinated, it drove Sillén headfirst into further revolutionary ferocity. While Sweden has its own revolutionary history, like the hunger protests of 1917 and more recently the revolution in 36’, the party traces its origins back to Red October, to Lenin, to socialism. "

Now the attention to the international question may finally be asked, whether Sweden should dedicate her to such a monumental task. While some camps within the party see the restoration of a full pledge to internationalism as the only viable option, many within Linderot’s circle remain wary of undertaking such a task. \n\nSweden is, by all measures to most, a small nation, compared to titans like the French or the former revolutionaries spanning across Russia, in comparison Sweden is tiny. As such, Linderot’s circle believe that a concentrated plan at freeing possible nations closer to home from their capitalist masters, while allying with any foreign group of similar ideology willing to aid in spreading the revolution, is the most realistic way to go about such a move. A third camp, based around Hugo Sillen’s hardliners, believe that vying for any sort of international mission in the near future is guaranteed to doom Sweden, bringing her workers and citizens to shackles under foreign oppression once more. Hugo maintains that, only once Sweden has developed and fully grown her strength to such grand heights can she even dare claim the mantle of an international revolution. In this he has greeted the ‘Communism in One Nation’ foreign policy, basing itself on the fact that communism must be cradled and grown within one country before it can begin to spread. In this he has outlined that other Nordic countries are accepted into this sphere, seeing them as vital to the Swedish revolution. \n\nThe politburo now lies once more at a difficult choice, going with the radicals and their internationalist mission?

Expelled from his own party, removed from the ruling coalition and forced into house arrest, Nils Flyg the former leader of the country has long since resigned himself to a life of unease and worry, though still remaining devoted in his belief in a socialist world. Reading the news and sending letters to his remaining friends and acquaintances, under constant surveillance, Flyg has tried to remain in the loop as to what happens to his country and the people within, remaining still adamant that he’s done nothing wrong in the cause of Swedish socialism. Today however, Flyg has met his end. While writing on a piece critical  to the new regime, Flyg suffered from a catastrophic heart attack. Alerting his guards to his emergency, the guards called swiftly to their superior officer, the man assigned to have a special oversight over Flyg in the interest of the party: Hugo Sillén. Sillén, unable or unwilling to give a fast enough response on whether or not to send Flyg to the hospital or to give any direction whatsoever, was soon informed that Flyg simply passed away. In the halls of power, Sillén’s inaction is now coming under harsh critique, with Linderot accusing Sillén of gross negligence in letting Flyg die. Arguing that Flyg posed no threat to the regime, that since all his letters and correspondence was monitored and censored, his death makes the regime seem all the more vindictive. Countering this attack, Sillén states that Flyg had to die to save the country, and that he did not deserve medical help from a people he once sought to oppress. Furthermore, Sillén argues that he himself was suffering from ‘revolutionary exhaustion’ and was simply physically unable and mentally unwilling to give a quick and speedy response to Flyg’s plight. \n\nIn a small field in his local cemetery Nils Flyg is buried, surrounded by friends and family, monitored by the apparatus of the state.

swerev.77.d:0 "In the very early morning, the quiet of Flyg’s home was loudly broken by his cries of pain, found by his aides clutching his chest in agony and breathless, requesting to be taken to the hospital as soon as possible. Once he had arrived, some of the best doctors across Sweden were summoned to administer his condition and figure out what was going wrong. It was quickly found that for many years now Flyg had been plagued with random bouts of chest pain and general illness, originating near his heart while often happening without warning or a natural trigger. After this, it was quickly found he had suffered a minor blood clot, which had occurred near his heart which caused the large bout of pain.\n\nThe doctors now believe Flyg suffers from not just clotting issues, but a chronic heart condition of some kind, believed to possibly be atrial fibrillation. A heart condition that causes the heart to beat without a consistent rhythm and sporadically, leading to bouts of pain, breathlessness and clotting.Such a condition is believed to originate from birth, while the triggers still thus remain entirely unknown, some studies from Britain have claimed alcohol could worsen the condition.\n\nHowever, in the far lands of Australasia, a pathologist has recently made a discovery that is considered ground breaking in the treatment of Atrial fibrillation. Sir Sydney Smith, a New Zealand born pathologist, discovered that by getting, what he now calls ‘Digoxin’, from the Foxglove plant, which has been previously used to treat ‘breathlessness’ and undiagnosed chest pain. Other scientists in Smith’s field have also shown the medication favour, from the likes of Sir Thomas Lewis who has shown great success in using Digoxin alongside Quinidine for a combined treatment of Atrial fibrillation and flutter. Digoxin has thus shown some promising studies in the field of atrial fibrillation and heart failure, bringing the heart back into a steady rhythm. While the exact mechanisms of action of such a drug is still far from known, the results are quickly speaking for themselves as patients trailed on the medication show a quick recovery of breath, steady heartbeat and overall improved function. But Digoxin does not come without its fair share of risks, some patients suffering extreme nausea, vomiting, psychosis and full heart failure.\n\nThe doctors now turn to Agaton Blom, Flyg’s right hand man and second in command of the party, for the weight of whether to treat Flyg with Digoxin knowing that it may safe or take his life in mere days, or hold of treatment for now, giving Flyg only Quinidine, which suffers from less adverse effects, for his basic heart rhythm."

The hall was alive with conversation, the topics ranging from the growing German hegemony in Europe to the uncertain threat posed by Russia to the east.\n\nAs the evening drew on, witnesses recall that Flyg appeared pale and withdrawn, though he brushed off concern with his usual confidence. When he rose to speak, his words were sharp and resolute until they were suddenly cut short. Midway through his address, he clutched his chest and collapsed to the floor. Panic swept through the hall as aides and doctors rushed to his side, but despite their efforts, it was too late. Nils Flyg, architect of the Swedish revolution and helmsman of the nation, was dead.\n\nRumours quickly began to spread throughout Stockholm.

Rumours of his worsening health began to spread across Stockholm, with whispers circulating through the halls of government that the Helmsman’s time might soon come to an end.\n\nYet, on the fifth day, a miracle occurred. Flyg awoke with renewed strength, his breathing steady, his complexion returning to its familiar vigour. The irregular beating of his heart had finally stabilised. Against all odds, the new therapy had worked. The doctors declared him out of danger, though they cautioned that he would need continued rest and careful supervision.\n\nWhen Flyg finally appeared before the party leadership once more, his return was met with thunderous applause. To many in the SNSP, it seemed as though fate itself had intervened to preserve the architect of the Swedish revolution. His recovery became a symbol of perseverance and divine providence, a sign that the Helmsman’s mission for Sweden was far from over."

However, the disciplined iron front of a man she saw on the posters and heard his booming voice over the radio is merely one side of Lindholm’s coin. His other half was one of a quieter and less spoken, changing some of his party's original goals, such as halting industrialisations in some areas, believing them to be natural wonders that should not become spoiled with steel and iron. In other areas, political rivals found themselves with lessened prison sentences, allowed to eventually become free once more and rejoin Swedish society.

Under strict supervision from Lindholm’s most loyal guardsmen, the generals Archibald Douglas and his former associate Martin Ekström have been given new titles of Generals in the reformed Swedish army and the chance to redeem themselves from their past sins. \n\nWhile such a move is seen as insane by many on the left, Lindholm’s mishmash of fanatics see this as a national win, that if the possibility to reform such men is possible, then surely the entire nation could be as well.

Unlike the crumbling constitutions of Britain or the hollow principles of France, Sweden’s new charter will be a testament to her unique spirit—crafted not from borrowed ideals, but from the blood, toil, and will of the Swedish people. \n\nIn his address, Lindholm fiercely condemned the 3rd Internationale and its pitiful doctrine of blind internationalism—calling it not a vision of unity, but a grotesque denial of national identity. He proclaimed that their obsession with borderless brotherhood had led to their moral and structural decay. And when their house of cards inevitably collapses, it will be Sweden—disciplined, unified, and reborn—that shall rise to pick up the shattered remnants of Europe. Not out of charity, but duty. Not in weakness, but in strength. \n\nEspousing a bold vision blending radical nationalist purpose with a reimagined form of Swedish socialism, Lindholm's words struck like lightning—commanding applause, evoking passion, and stirring the very soul of the nation. As his speech came to an end, a thunderous ovation erupted—thousands of voices united as one, echoing his vision across the capital and beyond.\n\nThe world now gazes upon Sweden with awe, fear, and fascination. No longer the placid, democratic monarchist bastion of yesteryear, our nation has been reborn as a blazing pillar of social-nationalist resolve. Under the watchful eye of the Riksledare, Sweden stands proud; unyielding, sovereign, and ready to shape the destiny of a crumbling continent."

Even before the term Sverige existed, when Sweden was a mixture of small tribal chiefdoms and different regional petty kingdoms, a monarch has existed on plains and in forests, on sea and on land. Not anymore. Following the decision to remove the monarchy, and in the process kick the Bernadottes out onto the curb, discussion has been raging within the halls of power as to what to do with the now crownless aristocrats. While it is true that several Swedish kings have been downright positive for the proletariat in the past, it is also true that the institution itself is evil, built upon the very concept of oppression, and can never be allowed back into being. As such, a decision must be made as to what the new Sweden should do with its former royals. Some advocate forced exile, dumping the royals out of the country, not unlike what was done with several other high society families. Banned from ever returning, they would exist as mere remnants of an oppressive system cast aside. Others believe that an example should be made of the royals. After all, as can be seen with the exiled British monarchy in Canada, royals exiled can still scheme to reclaim their crown, and thus a more permanent solution should be found…"

swerev.87.d:0 "The Swedish church has existed ever since the time of Luther, when the liberator king Gustav Vasa, not content to just free the nation from the shackles of the Kalmar Union, decided to free Sweden from the shackles of Rome as well. Since its founding the church has always been hand in hand with the interests of the state and crown, and as such an oppressor of the proletariat. In Swedish society until just recently, the local priest was as important as the bailiff or the policeman, rendering judgement on if you were dissolute or sinful, someone to be scorned and punished simply by not following strict church dogma. Indeed, sometimes it was more terrifying to be confronted by the priest than by an agent of the government, for not only could the priest destroy your family, he’d make everyone know about it too. It is in this context that the Swedish church is viewed most disparagingly by any sane socialist, and many within the left as a whole want the entire institution abolished. That said however, while many priests have been and sometime even are acting in favour of reaction, the church is not devoid of merit. The church runs several charities that aid the poor, have historically aided in making Sweden one of the most literate countries on earth via studies of the bible, and it has always been keen to foster a nature of national unity and peace among men. Indeed, several politicians and members of our wider movement are not just from religious households, but have relatives who are priests or otherwise engaged in the church. As such, perhaps instead of destroying the church, it can be rebuilt to serve the needs of a new Sweden and a new society, after all, Jesus was a carpenter. "

Many have been sacrificed in the name of national revolutionary renewal, exiled masses huddle abroad dreaming of once again returning home, and opponents to Lindholm are often threatened, or downright disappeared. All of it however, is viewed by Lindholm as at least necessary, and at most downright required, but the Riksledare knows also that more sacrifice, more blood, and more effort must be spent to cement the struggle for generations to come.

And strike back they have.\n\n Although unable to put up a pitched battle against the government, radicals affiliated with the Paris Clique have gone underground, committing acts of terror against isolated garrisons, targeting members of the former royal household and importing tonnes of weapons from abroad. Although the army is struggling to take control over the situation, more radical groups like the militants under Ekströms leadership have come out of the woodwork to finally fight their red enemies, using their experiences from the war in Finland and Estonia to locate and destroy pockets of resistence. Despite this, radicals were today able to strike at the very heart of the nation. In his castle in the stockholm archipelago, Gustav V and his family had observed the happenings on the mainland with significant worry and trepidation. Not only had the government been overthrown by the army, but reports were flowing in of violence and repression, not to mention acts of terror. Still, on their island of Tullgarn, Gustav V's favorite summer retreat, they considered themselves safe enough. Elements of the army had taken up positions outside the residence to protect the family, and the household were unable to intervene or act, forced to wait on the island until chaos on the mainland had subsided. It is in this context that the former king, now just calling himself 'Mr. G', went rogue.\n\n Not willing to be cooped up in his favourite residence he wandered out to inspect his boats, when a dissident soldier emerged, shooting dead the nearly 80 year old former monarch. Although apprehended before he could kill himself, the promise of a horrifying punishment for his crime is little comfort for the now grieving family."

Many in Sweden are shocked at this announcement, with many more world wide stunned at both the near possibility of revolution in Scandinavia, as well as the end of Swedish democracy. \n\nRiots and large demonstrations have now sprung up across the nation, with those from both the SAP and SSV calling this an outrageous betrayal of democracy. Former King Gustav V has been relatively silent on the whole situation, while his son and former crown prince Gustav Adolf has expressed sympathies towards Helge Jung, publicly endorsing the army's declaration of martial law as a necessity to save Sweden from those who would wish to erode her traditions.

As such, another candidate has been found, the relatively young Duke of Västerbotten, Prince Gustaf Adolf.

The monarchy that was unceremoniously cast aside by the traitorous syndicalst regime in Parisian imitation, is to be restored. This decision, made by the High Command and sanctioned by the Jung Junta, marks a return to Sweden’s rightful traditions. \n\nYet, the throne cannot remain empty. A sovereign must be chosen. \n\nOne might expect the heir apparent, Prince Oscar Adolf, eldest son of the exiled King Gustav V, to reclaim his birthright. But such hopes are in vain. Oscar Adolf, having grown sympathetic to liberal democrats abroad and advocating for a return to a constitutional monarchy, has alienated himself from the military. \n\nThe attention of the Junta has thus turned to his son Prince Gustaf Adolf, Duke of Västerbotten. A man molded by discipline and driven by fervent Swedish nationalism, Gustaf Adolf has expressed an unwavering commitment to our new regime. His youth and ideological alignment with the Jung Junta make him an ideal symbol of a revitalized Sweden, traditional, united, and strong.\n\nHowever, not all within the armed forces are aligned behind the young Duke. A second name has emerged, Count Folke Bernadotte of Wisborg, a man of noble blood and diplomatic prowess. Known for his humanitarian efforts and close ties within aristocratic and international circles, Bernadotte commands respect among the officer corps, particularly those outside the inner circle of the Junta. His moderate views and experience suggest a king who could stabilize the nation and perhaps reintroduce Sweden onto the world stage diplomatically. Yet, he has never voiced strong support for the nationalist ideals now driving our military government. \n\nThe choice is delicate. One candidate is a banner for the new Sweden, loyal to the regime and molded for national rebirth.

Friendly to everyone, diplomatic, not too ambitious and broadly liked by the population as a whole, him becoming king is not a hard ask at all. Indeed, although disinherited, that can simply be brushed aside as another poorly thought out action by the past ruling line. Already Folke is learning to no longer refer to himself as 'Folke af Wisborg', the title used for disinherited Swedish royals, and is gradually adjusting to his position of king. Indeed, Folke is also beginning to assert his independence over the more radical members of the Junta, like Douglas, intending to be made king with the consent of the people, rather than without. That said, no king has ever been named Folke in the past, and as such Folke and his burgeoning court must sort out the growing issue of his regal name. \n\nThere are a few options on the table, ranging from the more traditional to the more radical. First option is to simply name Folke Carl, like past kings before him. Second option is to name him after his father and grandfather, king Oscar II.

With a bias towards the members of the Entente, alongside connections to those in the Electoral league in the former Riksdag, he would maintain the military's authority while bringing back many of the civilian politicians from the Electoral league and People’s Party. \n\nIn the final camp sits Archibald Douglas, considered more politically involved than the other two men, known to frequent nationalist clubs and groups, Douglas upholds a more expressional view on Swedish nationalism. Alongside Martin Ekström, another prominent military figure, they lead a small group known as the Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti (National Unity Party of the Swedish Realm), dominated by generals and the upper class, the group advocate for Swedish expansionism and the belief in Swedish exceptionalism. With views not too dissimilar to that of the Iron Guard in Romania, the group has largely been unheard of or unseen due to its limited support base.

However due to the youth’s increasing radicalism towards the right in face of rising syndicalism in Europe, they were expelled from the AV and a new youth organisation was formed. However, some remained under Elmo’s leadership, continuing to follow his ideals. \n\nThese ideals were molded from his visits with the famous, or infamous, Charles Maurras and the recently deceased Rudolf Kjellén. Such figures formulated Elmo’s own ideological view, one where the King holds a necessary place in society in which hierarchy is enforced, royal corporatism is employed and anti-democratic views become prevalent. \n\nNow with a formal meeting between him and Douglas, he can finally propose his plan to the Riksledare. Granting Elmo position as the honorary Riksledare, allowing Douglas to maintain most of his control, in return for Elmo to enact more of his Maurrasism policies. While Douglas could easily oust this man in favour of maintaining the current status quo, Elmo’s connections to groups in the exiled National French State, some members of the northern Italian breakaway states and in Spain could prove favourable should he be given the position.

Such a shift has been utilised by the current regime, furthering the ethereal nature of the crown as more than just the figure who sits upon the throne. \n\nStill a long way from the vision of monarchs seen in nations like Japan or the Russian Empire, with time the Swedish monarchy will become a beacon of the soul of Sweden."

The counter-revolution was swift and ruthless, arresting, purging, and crushing those who had dragged the country into ruin. With the old regime dismantled, the military turned to a new figure to lead the nation: a man of steel resolve, an ardent ultranationalist, and a symbol of discipline and renewal.\n\nUnder his guidance, Sweden has been reforged. The excesses of the past have been swept away, the economy has stabilized, and the people's faith in the state has been restored. Through sweeping reforms, national unity campaigns, and strict control over dissent, a new era has begun—one defined not by class warfare, but by strength, order, and the supremacy of the Swedish nation.\n\nWhere once there was chaos, there is now purpose.

Deemed as the face of the army's cause, his unmatched determination in defending Sweden against the problematic revolutionaries as well as his swift action against them, has saved Sweden from drowning in the red tide that has swept Europe. Organising divisions and regiments, he set up vast defensive outposts in all major cities, allowing the army vital breathing room to organise itself and fight against the reds. Being seen as one of the most determined men in the Generals corp, he has now risen atop the ranks as the sole leader of Sweden. Uniting rightist elements from the former General electoral league while also unleashing the radical paramilitaries under Douglas against the socialists and syndicalists. \n\nHis cementation of leadership marks a straightforward path for Sweden, characterised by a heavy focus on national defence, flexible foreign policy and action against any red elements that try to surround Sweden. His government has been nicknamed the ‘Jung Junta’, by both his supporters and detractors, as it seems Jung’s Junta is here to last."

Forming protests at the former Riksdag, demanding for the military and Jung to step down and allow democratic elections to continue under civilian rule. Due to this, Jung has ordered the entire arrest of those registered under the former governments, consisting mainly of those from the Farmer’s league and Hansson’s democrats. Many from the People’s Party and General Electoral League remain silent on the continued arrests, with the most outspoken joining the ranks of those imprisoned. \n\nHowever, General Martin Ekstroem has put forward a proposal to Helge Jung. Claiming that at the current rate of arrests, most of the former politicians will be able to flee Sweden and form exile governments in supportive nations, undermining the Junta’s legitimacy as the sole Swedish government. In this case, Ekstroem asks for extended powers, promising swifter action against the former politicians, promising grander results than the current methods.

Already well connected with the upper strata, smaller parties are gradually proclaiming support for the military regime, and good pr is key. Although he has friends in the media and personally very friendly, Jung suffers from the perception that he's a bit of a cad, a bit sassy, and a bit smug, and a scandal has broken out regarding his crude tongue... \n\nA few days ago, at a meeting with wealthy socialites during which he was in conversation with two ladies of high class, he shocked the prudish upper classes. As the two ladies made a series of disparaging remarks about their third, who was absent from the event, one of the ladies asked Jung what he thought about the missing third. 'Surely she's not all bad?' the lady asked Jung. 'I do not know, I haven't been that deep in her.' \n\nAlthough blaming the comment on too much gin and far too little tonic, it's clear Jung simply cannot handle himself in public, and as such, perhaps it's best he take a step back, to continue his rule over the junta in the background? If so, Axel Gyllenkrok is more than eager to put his own spin on the junta, letting Jung take more of a backseat on the public side of the Junta."

It was through the decisive intervention of the Army, under the firm hand of General Helge Jung, that order was restored. Yet even within the counter-revolutionary coalition, fractures remain.\n\nAmong Jung’s early allies was General Archibald Douglas, a capable commander and fierce opponent of the left. However, Douglas has long harbored sympathies for ultranationalist elements that now operate beyond the Army’s direct control. These groups, forged into paramilitary bands during the civil unrest, proved useful in routing the final remnants of socialist militias. But in the months since, they’ve grown increasingly reckless, disobeying orders, committing atrocities, and threatening the discipline of the restored Swedish state.\n\nNow, Jung moves to reassert full control. Reaching out to Douglas, he offers an ultimatum: disband the paramilitaries and integrate their members into the formal armed forces, or face dissolution by force. Only by streamlining command and eliminating rogue elements can Sweden's military and government march as one."

Until now, Jung’s woes went unheard, now with the reins of the nation in his hands, a vast defensive rearmament plan has now begun. Fortifications are set up along all neighbouring borders, whether they are friend or foe, alongside crucial sea forts in all major cities starting construction.

Through trials at home and abroad, he has steered Sweden away from division and weakness. Now, all opposition has been silenced or co-opted, and the nation marches forward as a beacon of Nordic strength and order.\n\nSweden stands tall, not as a kingdom nor a proletarian dream, but as a disciplined republic born in fire and sustained through will."

The Junta has made it clear, those industrialists and businessmen who embrace the cause of Sweden’s military resurgence are richly rewarded with government contracts, tax incentives, and state-backed support. For those who resist or fail to fall in line with the new order, the punishment is swift and severe. The loyalty of our industrial elite is no longer optional; it is mandatory. Those who stand with us will be instrumental in securing Sweden’s future—while those who oppose us will be swept aside. \n\nWith companies like Aktiebolaget Landsverk leading the charge, we now possess the industrial backbone necessary to become an unstoppable force in Europe.

Ehrensvärd has commanded against harsh treatment of civilians, focusing more on general arrests of major political targets and terrorists, while bringing more soldiers into rebuilding infrastructure. This u-turn in military direction, causing some upset amongst the more rigid generals, has elated the civilian populace, bringing hope back into the army as a force of stability, not an occupying force. \n\nWith much still needed to be done before the public completely accepts military rule, these first few incremental steps will go far."

Now, at the helm of the nation, Ehrensvärd has ordered a telegram be sent to the King in Ottawa, one filled with admiration and desire for mutual aid.

As such, currently unions remain banned nationwide, however Ehrensvard has now allowed the formation of new trade unions, under some restrictions. Unions must remain patriotic first and foremost, disallowing and sedition or disident ideologues to seize their reigns, alongside this army oversight over unions will be enacted.

Bagge, now at the head of a revitalized National Organization of the Right, reborn from the ashes of the old General Electoral League, has positioned himself as a staunch advocate for a constitutional restoration. While King Gustaf VI has been allowed to serve in a ceremonial role, true authority remains elusive, held tightly by the generals and their inner circle.\n\nStill, a possible concession could mark a tentative turning point. With careful statesmanship and national unity, Bagge hopes to slowly reclaim Sweden’s democratic traditions, extinguished but not forgotten. The road ahead is uncertain and fraught with internal tension, but the flicker of parliamentary governance has not been fully snuffed out.

Instead, the Swedish Armed Forces established a military junta republic, consolidating power under a council of high-ranking officers led by Ehrensvärd. Civilian governance was partially restored, with a tightly controlled parliament and limited press freedoms, offering a veneer of normalcy to a nation exhausted by strife.\n\nYet beneath this facade of republican stability, the military's grip remains unyielding. Ehrensvärd, as Commander of the Nation, wields supreme authority, his influence permeating every facet of the state. The civilian cabinet functions, but only with the junta’s tacit approval.

swemil.34.d:0 "It is a known fact that youth movements tend to be more radical than their parent organisation, and in the case of the AV’s old youth league, Sveriges Nationella Ungdomsförbund (SNU) this has been proven true once again. In the last few years, in active opposition to the rising tide of socialism, the SNU radicalized further from just being hard conservative, into something else entirely. Under the new leader Elmo Lindholm the SNU has been forced out from cooperation with the AV, rebranded Sveriges Nationella Förbund (SNF), and has become a radical force on the right. Forced out by Arvid Lindman and Gösta Bagge due to the SNU’s extremism becoming unpalatable, the SNF finds itself as the only extreme-right mass party in Swedish politics, so disconnected from the idea of a democratic system, liberal values and socialist philosophy that it can only truly be described as radically reactionary, though even calling the SNF that is doing it a disservice. Elmo Lindholm, docent in latin language and literature and a major intellectual, has turned the once unruly youth movement into a politically charged and militant party, together with his direct subordinate, army officer Alf Meyerhöffer who commands the combat organisation. By providence or by pure luck, skill or chance, the SNF has come to power in Sweden. Wanting a strong welfare system, the state as an active part in the economy, the extermination of all socialist activity and the permanent and total end to the democratic system, the SNF’s manifesto is long, and wants to ban everything from Jazz to miscegenation. With the army preoccupied dealing with socialist opposition, it seems the only person able to restrain the new government is the king, as the SNF is fervently monarchist. Already the king has been forced to intervene in government policy, something Lindholm, begrudgingly or not, has been made to accept. Taking inspiration from history rather than from modern political thinkers, the only political thinker somewhat on Elmo’s wavelength is Charles Maurrass in National France, his writings having inspired Lindholm in the organisation of his movement."

Birger Furugård and Eric von Rosen, once eager supporters of Elmo Lindholm’s great plan, have become hostile in recent weeks. Birger Furugård, a veterinarian inspired by the Iron Guard in Romania, wants to turn Sweden into some kind of legionary hellscape, crushing Swedish tradition and culture in the process, in service of some racist policies even unpalatable to Lindholm. Although sharing in Furugårds antisemitism to some degree, Furugård has proven to simply be a hysteric madman, prone to accusing enemies of being members of the tribe, even going so far as to cryptically suggest that Elmo himself, even famed adventurer Sven Hedin, were Jewish as well, or at least of ‘mixed stock’, in his affiliated newspaper Vidi. Elmo wants to put Furugård out to pasture for personal reasons, but also in an attempt to build a bridge with the royal family. King [SWE.GetLeader] has made it clear in no uncertain terms that he will abdicate should Elmo fail to restrain the antisemitism of his movement, and that he will simply not accept Furugård’s endless vitriol any further. n/n/Furthermore, Eric von Rosen, once a darling of Swedish reaction and major supporter of Elmo in his early years, has to be dealt with as well. When not carving runes and attempting to translate old norse texts in his castle, Eric von Rosen has been a staunch supporter of ending what he considers to be the ‘Jewish Christ’, in favour of a ‘Germanic Christ’, wanting to turn the church into an instrument of whatever whims von Rosen has in his apocryphal mind at any given moment. In Rockelsta castle Eric invites radical thinkers from all across Europe and abroad, meeting with everyone from the strange anglo Arnold Leese to figures affiliated with Hugenberg in Germany, wanting to form some kind of secret association, likely something not exactly beneficial to the new government. Clearly, Eric von Rosen must be removed, at least according to Meyerhöffer, Elmo’s second in command. According to Meyerhöffer, von Rosen has attempted to formulate some kind of opposition to the new regime, and has been using the meetings in his castle to gather support from abroad. Following an emergency session, the government has as such decided to arrest both Furugård and von Rosen, putting the former in jail, the latter in house arrest."

Or at least that was the plan, and while still a major principle of his movement, Elmo Lindholm has been forced to adapt. While various secret societies have been destroyed and its members either fined or put behind bars, perhaps the biggest secret society in Sweden are the Freemasons, and their roots go rather deep, even too deep for Elmo to root out without killing his own movement. Several members of his own party are Freemasons, fellow nationalist Martin Ekström is a Freemason too, and several priests in the church are themselves Freemasons. Perhaps worst of all, there are terrifying rumors abound that Elmo Lindholm himself is a Freemason, or perhaps Meyerhöffer too, with those of a conspiratorial mind like Furugård accusing the entire movement of being essentially one big Judeo-Masonic plot to destroy the country. Regardless, ignoring the rumors, it is clear that Elmo Lindholm has been forced to compromise on his stance of banning all secret societies… After all, the royal family has, since at least the 18th century, been closely tied to the Swedish Masonic Order, [SWE.GetLeader] himself being the protector of the movement. As such, Lindholm must walk a tightrope on how to deal with Freemasons in his new country, either by simply ignoring the Swedish Masonic Order, or maybe even tying himself to it more closely. Gustav III joined the order and was able to save the country as a result, using his contacts therein to overthrow the corrupt aristocratic duopoly that was running the country at the time, ushering in a period of culture, art and law.

Prior to the French Revolution, when their king was barbarically beheaded by the hoi polloi, Sweden and France were as close as peas in a pod, the two even fighting each other with a certain level of respect. Indeed, during Sweden’s worst years after the Great Northern War, it was French money and French support that saw the country bounce back from the brink of the abyss, and even before that, during the 30 years war, the Catholics in France bankrolled the Protestant Swedes to give the Austrians a bloody nose. Indeed, during the age of Gustav III Sweden and France were perhaps as close as ever, the courts routinely corresponding, with the diplomat in Paris, Axel von Fersen, even having a fling with Marie Antoinette herself. When the dastardly revolutionary took Paris with storm, and forced the poor king Louis XVI to play along as a puppet, Gustav III attempted to rally a force to save the king, to kill the revolution in its cradle, only for the great powers to ignore his pleas. As the ideals of the enlightenment fell under the bloody banner of the french revolution, Sweden and France became enemies, and in the subsequent wars against Napoleon Swedes fought bravely, friendly ties somewhat maintained thanks to the respectful and honorable conduct of Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, who repatriated Swedish prisoners of war back home without abuse or ransom. When Bernadotte was later invited to become crown prince, the former republican faced his former superior Napoleon at the subsequent Battle of Leipzig, the Battle of the Nations, cementing his loyalty to his new home. n/n/Since the fall of Napoleon however, Swedish diplomatic interests have long favoured Germany and Great Britain, viewing them as more important in the fight against Russian expansionism. As the new century develops however, with the true French finally in control-albeit only in Algiers-it is time for Swedes and Frenchmen to close ranks once again. A delegation from France, led by Maurrass loyalist Maurice Pujo, was received today in Gothenburg, from where they were taken through Göta Kanal to Stockholm, and treated to a royal reception. Despite clear differences, such as the Maurrassists believing in a more decentralized system to the more centralist slant of SNF, not to mention the question of religion, the week long meeting has been a success. After days of negotiation and debate, the French delegation proved unwilling to budge on their anti-protestant stance, with the Swedes unwilling to entirely drop relations with Germany, though despite this both parties took plenty of pictures, shook hands, and engaged in playful banter about each countries respective cuisine. What was achieved in the long event is a shared declaration, that Swedish and French ties shall be stronger going forwards, that Europe must be purged from liberalism, socialism and anglophilia, and that values and peoples hostile to the nature of Europe must be forced out. Despite the royal reception however, with plenty of pomp and circumstance, his royal majesty (get leader) refused to shake hands with Maurice Pujo, dismayed with the treatment of Jews, Protestants and Masons in Algiers. Nevertheless, the visit has been a great success, and both sides count it as a major victory."

Just fifteen years at the start of his reign following the tragic death of his father, himself a king from an early age, at just 17 he had to fight in the Great Northern War, a massive sudden attack from Russia, Poland, Courland, Saxony, Denmark - Norway. Despite his young age, despite his rivals believing the boy king to simply capitulate, Charles rallied his soldiers, quoted scripture, and led his men in the field like a true warrior king. While riding his horse ‘Brandklipparen’, Charles forced the Danes to capitulate at the stroke of a hat by forcing them at gunpoint to accept an armistice in Copenhagen, destroyed the Russians at the spectacular battle of Narva, Savaged the Saxons at Fraustadt, and - in fitting Swedish tradition - threw Poland into chaos. Although critics accused him of being reckless, as indeed he found it hard to empathize with people and often brushed off casualties and indeed even person wounds as mere ‘Lappri’, nonsense - trifle, Charles was a true tactical genius, though his obsession with defeating his enemy in detail routinely harmed strategic planning. When engaged with fighting in Poland, Charles XII allowed the Russians to run roughshod throughout the Baltics, looting and burning without much resistance from the main army, busy stomping out armies in the rapidly collapsing Polish state. Indeed, when forcing the Danes to capitulate at the start of the war, Cossacks roamed around the eastern periphery of the kingdom, raiding and terrorizing the Finnish population, a population already suffering from famine and disease."

swemil.39.d:0 "Integral to the Swedish character is the Swedish Church, quite literally formed by the liberator king Gustav Vasa all the way back in the 16th century, together with the Petri Brothers. Claiming apostolic succession through the first Evangelical-Lutheran archbishop Laurentius Petri Nericius, the Swedish Church has long stood for a strong moral core in society, but fostering literacy via bible study societies, and more rurally where the local parish priest has been instrumental into ensuring his flock can read the bible. It was thanks to the Swedish Church that even the poorest in society could read prior to the implementation of the public school system, and as a result the government and nation are indebted. Lately however, during the onslaught of secularization and the liberal-conservative-socialist hydra dominating Swedish politics, the church has been put under threat of being decoupled from the government, from the state itself, to no longer even be the legal national church of Sweden. This cannot stand. Following a session in the Riksdag, Lindholm has decreed that the Swedish Church will remain an integral part of Swedish society and governance, even opening for the possibility of the archbishop Erling Eidem to serve as a minister in the government, possibly as a way to build a bridge with the Church, since Eidem routinely and fervently condemns Lindholms antisemitism. Despite Eidem and Lindholm not seeing eye to eye on most issues, with Lindholm finding the archbishop too outspoken and shrouded in mysticism, both agree that Sweden needs religion like a plant needs water. Already plans have been laid out for the mandatory teaching of the bible in school, at least parts of the bible Lindholm thinks to be most relevant to current events. The last time Swedish society was so engaged in the study of the bible and the practice of teaching it was during the Great Northern War, when soldiers in the field were taught that Russians, one and all, were descended from Cain and that Swedes, as direct descendents of Abel had a divine right to drive them out from the world. n/n/ Although nobody in the government wants a return to the mysticism and bible thumping madness of the past, Elmo, following in the footsteps of Maurrass, believes that a shared faith is good for society.

swemil.40.t:0 "Recreating the Royal Guard"
swemil.40.d:0 "Previously, the Royal Guard served as nothing more than a ceremonial force, soldiers brought out for parades, for when the King went in public or to ‘guard’ the royal palace. They became idols, but lost their iron, the fervor of the royal guard that was best shown in 1713. When Charles XII's royal guard of about 40 men fought alongside and defended the king against an Ottoman army of over 10,000. After a gruelling seven hours, the amassed Ottoman army proved victorious, forcing the King and his remaining men to surrender. While this battle ended in a defeat, it showed how dedicated such guardsmen were to their monarch, and the zeal they represented.\n\nSuch a zeal must be retooled, for our new royal guard must look to those brave men as an icon for them to embody. Alf Meyerhöffer has personally taken upon this task, seeing this as the best way to improve people’s trust in the National Federation’s ability to improve Sweden’s ability to defend herself. Some even say Meyerhöffer should become the new Rikseldare, allowing Lindholm to take a further back seat to handle the political scene far more efficiently while Meyerhöffer can allure the public eye and command a martial prowess that the Charismatic Elmo cannot possess. Either way, the new guard shall both guard the king, the Riksledare and the nation as a whole, sworn in to serve in the streets, sweeping for syndicalists and Jewry alike."
swemil.40.a:0 "Let Meyerhöffer command this new force!"
swemil.40.b:0 "Meyerhöffer shall take the martial command of Sweden!"
swemil.40.c:0 "Meyerhöffer shall take use the royal guards to secure every inch of Sweden!"

swemil.41.t:0 "A Vision in Flat-Pack"
swemil.41.d:0 "In the quiet forests of Småland, a young entrepreneur named Ingvar Kamprad has founded a small mail-order company by the name of IKEA. Selling everyday household goods at affordable prices, Kamprad's business model emphasizes efficiency, simplicity, and accessibility, a sharp contrast to the traditional, expensive furniture markets.\n\nThough still modest in scale, IKEA represents a new spirit of Swedish innovation and frugality, values that may one day shape not only domestic life, but the Swedish economy at large. For now, it is just a name. But to those who watch closely, it may be the beginning of something far greater."
swemil.41.a:0 "A promising future for Swedish industry."
swemil.41.b:0 "A brilliant mind, bring him into government!"

swemil.42.t:0 "Elmo Flag chooser"
swemil.42.d:0 "As the soon to be sole rulers of Europe, we must design a flag fit for our emerging Kingdom. And for that, Riksledare Lindholm has put forth a national competition for our new flag. \n\nUnder this, three options have captured the leaders eyes, all adorned with purple, the colour of European royalty and with a large circle of Fleur de Lys shown in a golden yellow. The differences arise in that the first option most signifies Swedish supremacy over this new empire with the three crowns inside a roundel in Sweden's national colours. Second is a similar design but without the roundel around the crowns. The final option places the crowns in the top left corner. \n\nThe final choice is..."
swemil.42.a:0 "The First, Swedish surpremacy and might!"
swemil.42.b:0 "The second, the crowns alone display our might!"
swemil.42.c:0 "The third, to show true European unity!"

swemil.43.t:0 "A Telegram from Stockholm"
swemil.43.d:0 "An unusual telegram has arrived from the Swedish government in Stockholm. Headed by the nations leader, Carl Ehrensvärd, it has proposed an olive branch to the Entente. Showing affection and admiration for the alliance, proposing mutually beneficial trade deals as well as aid to either nation. While a direct entry into the Entente is not proposed in the telegram, it also does not exclude such a possibility. We are now given the choice of sending some aid to their recovering nation after the attempted revolution, or deny them of such. Denying them will alienate them from the Entente, but Sweden could also pose a burden to the alliance."
swemil.43.a:0 "Send the aid, we extend in kind"
swemil.43.b:0 "We appreciate the telegram, but we must decline"

swemil.44.t:0 "A Response"
swemil.44.d:0 "It would seem the powers within the Entente have responded in kind! Sending some military and financial aid our way, alongside offering new trade deals between our nations. This will go a long way in both improving Sweden’s stability and growing our foreign relations with the Entente!"
swemil.44.a:0 "God save the Entente!"

swemil.45.t:0 "A Response"
swemil.45.d:0 "Unfortunately, our plea to the Entente has been denied. Appreciating our valiant effort to establish better relations, the Entente seem focused on their goals of Reclamation. This tunneled vision view may be their befal, however we must now move forward without the Entente."
swemil.45.a:0 "A sad state of foreign affairs"

swemil.46.t:0 "Thörnell, the loyalist"
swemil.46.d:0 "Stiff and cold, harsh and sarcastic, Thörnell is not liked by his subordinates. Viewed as merely an incompetent 'chair warmer' by the Jung 'Junta', viewed as a bloodthirsty white by the SSV, Thörnell remains in his position as Supreme Commander thanks to his good relations with the government. Believed to not be too ambitious to cause a fuss with the government, but not lax enough to keel over under stress, the government believes him to be the ideal head of the army, even though Gösta Bagge privately loathes him. \n\nA friend of Germany, and also a friend of the exiled French in Africa, Thörnell is worried about the growing threat of revolution, but does not believe SAP to be the harbinger of said societal upheaval. This puts him at odds with the increasingly radical 'Jungjunta', who believe that the SAP will simply open the door to further military cuts, followed shortly by socialist overthrow of both army and state. Perhaps the biggest trait he has, besides being deemed distant and uncharismatic, is his cold calm demeanour. Indeed, as much as the 'Junta' dislikes him, they too believe that he's as calm as a rock during times of unrest. Perhaps too calm."
swemil.46.a:0 "Our guy in the army"

swemil.47.t:0 "A Return to the Old Order"
swemil.47.d:0 "Despite repression of many political dissidents, an official declaration of the Junta and the appointment of  Ehrensvärd, many in Sweden and across the globe still denounce our government as illegitimate. Even as Ehrensvärd has embraced a few of the former conservative elements, we still struggle with issues of legitimacy. As such, some within our cabinet have proposed an idea to help our legitimacy, an old institution made new. By restoring and calling our government the Riksrådet or Privy Council of Sweden, an order from the medieval period of Sweden. The Riksrådet was once an advisory and co-ruling position alongside the King of Sweden. Whether we have a King or not, such an institution and return, could bring back legitimacy from history, a return to our true traditional government roots. Although such a proposal could work, others in our government call such a move as meaningless and a waste of time, and that such a name change remains unnecessary for now. Whatever we choose, it must be made now."
swemil.47.a:0 "Change it, we shall embrace our past!"
swemil.47.b:0 "Change it and fully embrace our past, restoring the Privy Council!"
swemil.47.c:0 "There is no need for a medieval change"

swemil.48.t:0 "Sveriges Riksbaner"
swemil.48.d:0 "As the nation rises from chaos and division, a suggestion has been raised by various officers to temporarily hoist the riksbaner instead. The royal banner of Sweden, the Riksbaner is an ancient banner supposed to be flown in battle, the current one from the middle of the 18th century. Featuring both royal symbols, seals and all manner of fancy details, the banner has seen numerous monarchs come and go, and is currently viewed as a distinctly borderline holy symbol of royal might. Currently only presented during the funeral procession of a monarch, the banner was last seen during the funeral of the late king, and has plenty of rules in how it is presented. Since the current flag might be seen as tainted by the few decades, perhaps its time for the country to embrace old traditions once more, to stand not under just any flag, but a banner of war and royal supremacy. "
swemil.48.a:0 "Let us raise this banner across the nation!"
swemil.48.b:0 "We will do fine as is"

swemil.49.t:0 "The Dissolution of the Landsorganisationen"
swemil.49.d:0 "It was no secret that the trade unions of Sweden, unified in the so-called Landsorganisationen, as well as those unified in the Central Worker's Organisation of Sweden (SAC), supported the old treacherous government. In the aftermath of the coup, many of these trade unions tried to organise strikes against the new government, with limited success. After some time, the junta did what was necessary and dissolved all trade unions."
swemil.49.a:0 "Good riddance"

swemil.50.t:0 "The Legacy of Carolus Rex - Part 2"
swemil.50.d:0 "A proponent of destroying an enemy in detail before moving onwards, it is with this understanding that one must judge the performance in the leadup to, and following, the battle of Poltava. Having been harried by cossacks throughout his campaign into Russia, and having been promised aid by Ivan Mazepa, Charles wanted to deal the Russians one final blow, defying the odds like he had done several times before, and force the Tsar at point of a sabre to make peace. The battle started poorly. The king was wounded, and was forced by his advisors to remain in the rear, and as the battle raged the landscape became shrouded in smog and sot from burning fortifications and gunsmoke, limiting the ability for either side to make solid decisions. The Swedes, exhausted after years of endless conflict without respite or return home, eventually broke. The Russians had proven themselves defiant and strong, much to the king’s begrudging respect, and when attempting to rally his men for one final last stand he was forced away into retreat, soon turning into a rout. Several years later, after a stint in the friendly ally of the Ottoman Empire and a long march home, Charles returned home to a country still in crisis. With the coffers of the nation empty, and with heroic generals like Magnus Stenbock in captivity in a once-again hostile Denmark or busy fighting rearguard actions in the east like Carl Gustaf Armfeldt, with the local Finnish population forced into forests and guerilla warfare against Russian occupation, Charles once again had to defy the odds. While resting after years abroad, the king decided to strike westwards into Norway, hoping to once again force the Danes to a fait accompli capitulation, to then march eastwards and confront the Russians once more. This was not to happen. Nobody knows what happened during the siege of Fredriksten Castle, with Norwegians and Danes claiming the king was shot by a sharpshooter, while Swedes leaning towards an officers plot against the king. Shot in the head at point blank, the king died and the campaign in Norway ended, triggering a retreat that would culminate in a series of horrible tragedies as soldiers were forced to march through snow, blizzard, and hostile harassment. When the war ended years later, Sweden and Northern Europe as a whole was left scarred. The baltics had been forcibly integrated into Russia, parts of Finland had been stolen away, and indeed the only real victor in the conflict was the Russians, their Tsar himself dying soon thereafter without being able to see his great victory truly manifest. Poland became entangled in chaos and exhaustion, Denmark was forced to play second fiddle to Great Britain, and Saxony found itself brushing up against a very antagonized Prussia.\n\nAs ‘Stormaktstiden’ came to an end, Sweden was forced to come to an understanding with its past. As a series of inept though often wellmeaning monarchs took to the throne, as nobles stole more and more power from the monarchy, as the already poor peasants of the country became poorer, perhaps the only treasure left was that of the memory of Charles XII. Once again, under the leadership of the SNF, the legacy of Charles will be harnessed into a force for good, a purifying force, a uniting force."

### Intro Events ###

swe.9999.t:0 "A Past of Stable Democracy"
swe.9999.d:0 "Throughout the Weltkrieg Sweden remained as a neutral power, even with pro-German sentiment in both her political scene and within the nobility, she retained a stance of Armed Neutrality for the entirety of the conflict. The Post-Weltkrieg era was marked with increasing German influence on the northern nation, large businesses from Germany securing vital trade with Sweden. Alongside the expanding German giant below, Sweden’s political scene benefited from a semblance of stability, with the introduction of universal suffrage in 1921, allowing for early general elections in which the first female MPs were sworn into the Riksdag which allowed for a Social Democratic victory. \n\nHowever luck would change when unemployment would rise due to economic downturns in 1924 when the United Kingdom would collapse in revolution, with this stark rise in Syndicalism and leftism, allowing for a conservative victory in the 1928 election under Arvid Lindman. Lindman would continue this legacy of conservatism in the European North until after his sudden resignation in 1935. This left the General Electoral League, the largest conservative party in Sweden, with the new leader Gösta Bagge who now leads the nation into the 1936 elections. \n\nWith growing international tensions, as both the exiled Entente, Japanese Empire and Third Internationale all seek to reclaim or conquer new territories, the next election shall be vital in defining Sweden’s place on the world stage"
swe.9999.a:0 "För Sverige!"

swe.17.t:0 "Swedish Refugees"
swe.17.d:0 "Sweden has fallen prey to the socialist scourge that has been plaguing Europe for a while. Following the successful establishment of a worker's state, local totalists have taken their chance to take their revenge on Swedish capitalists, politicians, priests and other men of the old Swedish regime. As a result, many try to flee Sweden and unlike many of the other nations falling prey to this scourge, they don't have a colonial empire to rely on. As such they are seeking refuge in [Root.GetNameDef]. Several groups have already arrived at our border, but should we accept them?"
swe.17.a:0 "Welcome in [Root.GetNameDef]!"
swe.17.b:0 "Turn away, Swedish scum!"



swe.30.t:0 "The Reestablishment of Trade Unions"
swe.30.d:0 "The ideologues of the SRNS considered it vital to reestablish worker's interest organisations for the nation to regain the working class' support. Several factions have arrived at the office of the Riksledare: the first one supports the establishment of a Guild System that is unique to Sweden. This would make all labourers members of guilds that will be established for their craft that can be freely joined if one switches carreers or starts at the labour market. Companies will be banned from contracting people who are not part of a guild and the guild will represent its members in labour negotiations.\nThe second proposal is to allow the trade unions to organise again, albeit under strict government control.\nLastly, some argue that trade unions in whatever form or terminology are harmful to Swedish society and should remain banned as it is."
swe.30.a:0 "The Guild system faction prevails"
swe.30.b:0 "Trade Unions are reestablished under strict government control"
swe.30.c:0 "Trade Unions remain banned"

swe.31.t:0 "The Guild System"
swe.31.d:0 "A year into the new 'Guild' system, we can conclude that it is rather successful. Even though critical eyes conclude that is just yet another way of the SRNS to control society, after all the implementation of 'Gilleledares' - Guild Leaders loyal to the regime - means that it allows the regime to exclude dissidents from society by excluding them from their craftmanship and even the labour market as a whole, the reality that suddenly all Swedish worker's are represented in labour negotiations has made barbarous practices like Statare untenable and the regime, previously considered one belonging to the rich, much more popular among the lower classes of Sweden."
swe.31.a:0 "Rich and poor Swedes stand together in the quest for the greater!"

swe.32.t:0 "The State of the Trade Unions"
swe.32.d:0 "Half a year after trade unions were, under significant government surveillance, allowed to function again, the results have sadly been disappointing. Instead of taking their new allegiance seriously, we immediately saw a revival of syndicalism in its ranks and the government was soon forced to act. Troublemakers were soon evicted from the trade unions and government control took the momentum once again, but as a result few workers consider the trade unions as they are a legitimate body defending their interests. To many, they are just organisations under the thumb of the bourgeoise government and the very bosses they are supposed to oppose."
swe.32.a:0 "Cut our losses, ban them again."
swe.32.b:0 "Make membership mandatory to force participation!"

swe.33.t:0 "The Trade Unions"
swe.33.d:0 "After the government decreed that everyone partake in the unions, they were suddenly packed with uninterested workers who reluctantly attended the union meetings. The legitimacy remained low, but with a lot of government pushing participation started to rise and after some time, some concessions convinced some more workers that there was merit in this system. As a result the controlled union system has become somewhat of a self-sustaining organism but it is probably still not what the Riksledare and the ideologues intended it to be."
swe.33.a:0 "Tell the press it's a great success!"

swe.34.t:0 "A Riksledare and an Archbishop"
swe.34.d:0 "The SRNS recognized the moral authority held over the Swedish people by the church of Sweden. In fact, gaining the support of this body was one reason the small Swedish Jewish community had seen protection by the Riksledare from the less racially inclusive elements in his cabinet, as the archbishop was known to oppose antisemitism. Because of these reasons, it was no surprise that Archibald Douglas and the archbishop of Uppsala, Erling Eidem met regularly. Douglas was willing to pass substantial laws favouring the church of Sweden, for instance to restore the legislation that rendered it illegal to leave the church as well as cracking down on sinful activities. In return however, the church would have to actively remove progressive anti-government clergy and openly support the Riksledare. Based on his conversation with the Riksledare, Erling called a synod to discuss the issue."
swe.34.a:0 "Let the synod run its course..."
swe.34.b:0 "Help the decision-making by visiting anti-government clergy."

swe.35.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.35.d:0 "The synod of the church of Sweden has concluded and the priests have agreed that no earthly government the likes of that of the SRNS can have unequivocal support, and that in this light the democracy that existed before suffered from a lesser moral deficit. In addition, they agreed one can't bargain for God's support with legislation in support of His values. People need to open their hearts for it themselves after all. The clear outcome of the synod is a rejection of the SRNS doctrine.\nThe Riksledare ignited in outrage by the news and by the end of the day the Church of Sweden was no longer the state church, nor could many priests of the organisation, including Archbishop Erling, enjoy their freedom anymore."
swe.35.a:0 "B-but wrath is a sin?"

swe.36.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.36.d:0 "Strangely, many progressive clergymen did not arrive at the synod or suddenly changed their minds on the matter. However, the synod went ahead as planned: The clergymen that were actually present agreed that the execution of God's will was worth some concessions and that SRNS government was already carrying out God's will by persecuting heathenly syndicalists and protecting Sweden from this scourge.\nThe Riksledare was delighted by the news and from that point on the church of Sweden became a integral if at times somewhat reluctant part of the SRNS propaganda machine, with a topdown enforcement of orthodox government support and heavy government support for the church in return."
swe.36.a:0 "We shall hold our end of the bargain too!"

swe.37.t:0 "Transition to a Civil Government"
swe.37.d:0 "As time passed on, the military form of government became increasingly tenuous to maintain. It was therefore no surprise that at some point, the Riksledare declared all seats in the Riksdag to be part of his own party the 'Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti'. Once this was done, power was transferred to the Riksdag, which immediately moved to permanently affirm Douglas's status as Riksledare in a law that allowed the holder of said office to bypass the Riksdag itself in the Swedish instruments of government. At this point, the Riksledare possessed almost unlimited power and Sweden as it was known before the coup would be forever gone."
swe.37.a:0 "It's different but still the same."

swe.38.t:0 "The New Instruments of Government"
swe.38.d:0 "The Riksdag has passed a new set of instruments of government which serves as the Swedish constitution. The new document explicitly excludes parties subscribing to marxist or syndicalist thought, and entrenches the right of the Swedish monarch to exercise its reserve powers, as well as other minor amendments that heavily favour the conservative government."
swe.38.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.39.t:0 "Sweden Wants to Join the Internationale"
swe.39.d:0 "The Swedish revolutionary government has petitioned us with their desire to join the struggle for the world revolution. Shall we crush the bourgeoisie together with the Swedish worker?"
swe.39.a:0 "Definitely!"
swe.39.b:0 "We shall never stand in battle with those sockpuppets!"

swe.40.t:0 "France Accepts!"
swe.40.d:0 "We have received word from the communard government that we are welcome in the struggle against the forces of reaction and the dark forces of financial capitalism. Together we shall crush the bourgeoisie!"
swe.40.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.41.t:0 "France Rejects Us!"
swe.41.d:0 "The communards have let us know that we are not welcome on the battlefield against the forces of reaction. Apparently they consider us just another front that will not be held."
swe.41.a:0 "Curse those snail-eaters!"

swe.42.t:0 "A Statue for a True Revolutionary"
swe.42.d:0 "While Per Albin Hansson was not without his faults - he was very strongly in favour of the rather hopeless strategy of working within the bourgeoise government to amend it - the man has shown himself to be a true hero of the revolution. After all, it was clear that he was most definitely intending to bring about the establishment of this republic as evidenced by the abdication of the king he pushed. Sadly, this great hero of the revolution perished at the hands of the military at the opening stages of a coup. If it wasn't for the heroic actions of a SP militia, we may never have been able to find back his body.\nOf course, such a glorious revolutionary needs to be remembered, and for that reason we have commissioned a large statue in the city where Hansson grew up: Malmö."
swe.42.a:0 "A great statue for a great revolutionary!"

swe.43.t:0 "First Day of the Revolution"
swe.43.d:0 "Exactly one year ago, the vicious capitalist tyranny was washed away with the blood of the proletariat. Since it is important for Sweden's people to remember that Sweden's freedom does not come free, we have decided to declare the day of the revolution a national holiday. On this day, all workers will have a day off and the state will organise activities for the next generation while the adults have a chance to socialise!"
swe.43.a:0 "This will become a yearly event!"

swe.44.t:0 "Day of the Revolution"
swe.44.d:0 "Once more, it is the birthday of the revolution. The state has commissioned activities for the children of Sweden in honour of the revolution while the adults, who are let off work, use their free day with the children gone to socialise!"
swe.44.a:0 "Leve vår Revolution!"

swe.49.t:0 "The General Electoral League Changes Its Name"
swe.49.d.socdem:0 "Since their defeat in 1936, the fate of the conservative General Electoral League has been one of misfortune. The party has been seeing much of its support defecting to the Social Democrats of Hansson, and those who supported the League in opposition to the Social Democrats are going back to the Folkpartiet if the polls are to be believed.\nIn an attempt to rebrand the party that is now the bastion of right-wing opposition and to reverse its fortunes once more, party leadership has elected to change the partyname into the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation). Whether this tactic will be successful in attracting more voters once again, remains to be seen."
swe.49.d.soccon:0 "Since our striking victory against the social democrats in 1936, the slow societal turn towards conservatism has benefited our popularity greatly. With support for Hansson and his lot shrinking each day, a decision has been made to espouse ourselves as the conservative juggernaut in Sweden. A name change, while seen initially by members of the AV as pointless, the idea of the proposal allows us to further draw in support and voters by decorating ourselves with a new face. With a majority of the party already in favour, it seems the new name for ourselves is now the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation). We can only wait and see for the public's reaction!"
swe.49.d.marlib:0 "While not necessarily a defeat, their second place in the coalition has warranted the conservatives a steep decline in voters and public support. With the majority now aligning with us, the Folkpartiet, and any wayward centrists turning towards the Farmer’s league or Hanssons social democrats. \n\nIn an attempt to rebrand the party that is now the bastion of right-wing opposition and to reverse its fortunes once more, party leadership has elected to change the partyname into the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation). Whether this tactic will be successful in attracting more voters once again, remains to be seen."
swe.49.a:0 "Interesting..."

swe.50.t:0 "The King Intends to Send a Letter"
swe.50.d:0 "His royal majesty has let us know his intention to send a letter to the German Kaiser. It seems he wants to thank the Germans for taking care of the syndicalist pest that is haunting Europe. Such a letter could potentially become embarrassing and damage our neutrality, so some in the government would like us to stop his majesty from sending this letter."
swe.50.a:0 "Strengthening our bonds with others can never hurt!"
swe.50.b:0 "We can't jeopardise our neutrality like this, forbid it!"

swe.51.t:0 "A Letter from the King of Sweden"
swe.51.d:0 "We have received a letter from King Gustaf V of Sweden. He thanks us for taking care of the syndicalist pest in France and congratulates us with the victories achieved so far. A most kind gesture from the Swedes to express their support for our cause like this."
swe.51.a:0 "Instruct our ambassador to thank them for this!"
swe.51.b:0 "A nice gesture indeed!"

swe.52.t:0 "German Thanks!"
swe.52.d:0 "The German ambassador has passed on his nation's thanks to one of our cabinet's ministers for the kind letter from our king supporting their cause against the syndicalists. They say it was a most kind gesture and that they consider us too to be good friends."
swe.52.a:0 "It was nice wasn't it? His majesty's own idea even!"
swe.52.b:0 "But we forb... No matter, splendid!"

swe.53.t:0 "Folkpartiet Rises in the Polls"
swe.53.d:0 "For a while, it seemed like disenfranchising the social democrats had made conservative control over Sweden unopposed. It seems however, that in their absence, the liberal Folkpartiet has risen to prominence, with much of the old social democratic support base now putting their weight behind them, knowing that while they do not espouse the same economic ideals as them, they do support bringing the SAP back into the legality and restoring freedom like it used to be before the conservatives made their control virtually impenetrable using the law."
swe.53.a:0 "A new challenger arises..."

swe.54.t:0 "The Folkpartiet Controls the Opposition"
swe.54.d:0 "For an extended amount of time, the conservatives have been the most influential party in Sweden, but this seems to be over. First they lost the government to the social democrats, and as they continued to fail to decisively recapture it, their performance at the polls has been declining. Last elections it has finally happened: with the conservatives once again winning the least amount of seats since the establishment of the modern Riksdag, they have lost their standing as the second-largest party and dropped to the third place in favour of the liberals, who will now take over the leadership over the Swedish opposition."
swe.54.a:0 "A dark day for Swedish conservatism"

swe.55.t:0 "[GetYear] Swedish General Elections"
swe.55.d:0 "The campaigning season has run its course again and the Swedish people have gone to the polls to elect the government they consider to be the best for Sweden. All that is left is for the ballots to be counted before we can declare the winner..."
swe.55.a:0 "The Social Democrats triumph!"
swe.55.b:0 "The Conservatives stand victorious!"
swe.55.c:0 "The Folkpartiet have won out!"
swe.55.e:0 "Emerging out, the Bondeförbundet has won!"

swe.56.t:0 "Social Democratic Government formation"
swe.56.d:0 "Once again, the social democrats have been victorious in the elections, and it is their right to form a Swedish government. The press eagerly wonders what kind of government will rule Sweden the coming years..."
swe.56.a:0 "A unity cabinet of all centrist parties"
swe.56.b:0 "An agrarian-social democratic coalition"
swe.56.c:0 "A one-party cabinet leveraging the acquired majority"

swe.57.t:0 "Conservative Government Formation"
swe.57.d:0 "The elections have been a clear victory for the conservatives, and as such it is only right that we will be the ones to form the Swedish government. The press is eagerly awaiting an announcement from the party as it will be instrumental in determining what kind of government will rule Sweden in the coming years."
swe.57.a:0 "We shall rule with the agrarians!"
swe.57.b:0 "The liberal Folkpartiet is our natural ally!"

swe.58.t:0 "Liberal Government Formation"
swe.58.d:0 "The liberals have decisively won the Riksdag in the elections, and as such it falls to the Folkpartiet to form the Swedish government. Many wonder what kind of government the liberals will cook up, and the press is eagerly awaiting the announcement."
swe.58.a:0 "A true liberal coalition with the Bondeförbundet"
swe.58.b:0 "A coalition with the conservatives, but under liberal leadership!"

swe.59.t:0 "A Pivotal Coalition Decision"
swe.59.d:0 "Against all expectations, Bondeförbundet has emerged as the largest party in the recent elections, riding a wave of rural support and public desire for pragmatic, centrist leadership. Now, with no clear majority in the Riksdag, the party faces a critical decision, whether to form a coalition with the market-liberal Folkpartiet, whose economic vision aligns with rural entrepreneurialism, or with the Social Democrats, whose focus on welfare and social cohesion appeals to many within Bondeförbundet's cooperative tradition. Both options offer stability, but also carry risks of alienating key parts of the base. The path chosen will define Sweden’s political direction for years to come."
swe.59.a:0 "Partner with the Folkpartiet for a liberal-centrist alliance"
swe.59.b:0 "Form a progressive bloc with the Social Democrats"

swe.60.t:0 "Sweden Implements Tariffs"
swe.60.d:0 "The Swedes have implemented tariffs against us, despite the fact that they are part of the Mitteleuropa Free-Trade Zone and thus in principle banned from implementing such measures. Many economists feel we should retaliate against this measure, lest the integrity of Mitteleuropa be harmed and other members get ideas!"
swe.60.a:0 "We shall retaliate!"
swe.60.b:0 "We have bigger fish to fry right now!"

swe.61.t:0 "Germany Retaliates!"
swe.61.d:0 "The Germans have not taken lightly to our attempt to bend the rules in our favour: they have instituted their own sanctions against us and due to their economic weight, this hurts our companies - mainly specialised in raw resources - a lot more than our sanctions hit them. New lay-offs are being announced as Swedish companies now need to pay tariffs to reach the German and Danish markets."
swe.61.a:0 "Blast!"

swe.62.t:0 "The Crisis Situation Improves"
swe.62.d:0 "The unemployment level has fallen below 24%. As a result, the Swedish economy is starting to show its first signs of recovery as more people work and they start spending their salaries again. Although the worst is over, we remain far from pre-crisis levels."
swe.62.a:0 "It's a start!"

swe.63.t:0 "The Crisis Situation Improves Further"
swe.63.d:0 "The unemployment level has now fallen below 20%. With more and more people starting to find work again, the Swedish economy is recovering at an ever-increasing rate. Despite this, the effects of the crisis can still be felt clearly and full recovery will still require a fair amount of effort."
swe.63.a:0 "Prosperity shall return with time!"

swe.64.t:0 "The Crisis Situation Improves Even More"
swe.64.d:0 "The unemployment level has now fallen below 16%. Many people who were previously stuck at home are finding jobs again and the situation looks a lot better already compared to earlier. While the effects of the crisis can still be felt, a full recovery seems closer than ever!"
swe.64.a:0 "Sweden will survive this!"

swe.65.t:0 "The Crisis Is Over!"
swe.65.d:0 "With the unemployment level below 12%, the Swedish economy is running once more at the speed it once used to before the disturbing events of black monday. We successfully resolved the economic downturn!"

swe.67.t:0 "The Crisis Commission Reports!"
swe.67.d:0 "The Crisis Commission that was set up in the 1936 Crisis Act has delivered the reports of last year's balance. They have been left on your desk."
swe.67.a:0 "Ah, splendid! I will have a look!"

swe.68.t:0 "Sovereign Debt Crisis"
swe.68.d:0 "Terrible! It was known that the commission had been unorthodox with the usage of loans, but noone had expected that it would be this bad! The enormous debt the commission has incurred in their attempts to counter Black Monday's effects can't be accounted for with the rest of the Swedish budget and we are forced to declare that our debts can't be repaid, bankrupcy in effect! Domestic and foreign investors alike will lose their money and surely not be happy!"
swe.68.a:0 "Oh no!"

swe.69.t:0 "Sovereign Debt Crisis in Sweden"
swe.69.d:0 "Sweden had long been considered a safe haven for investments, but not quite so anymore: this morning they have officially declared bankrupcy, apparently as a result of Black Monday: they are no longer capable of fulfilling their debts. Many [Root.GetAdjective] investors who invested in Swedish bonds have now lost their money."
swe.69.a:0 "Blast!"

swe.70.t:0 "Unemployment Decreases"
swe.70.d:0 "As a result of our policy of devaluing the Swedish Krona, it has become quite cheap to buy the raw resources we export. As a result, our exports skyrocketed and this is having a positive effect on our domestic employment!"
swe.70.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.71.t:0 "Hyperinflation"
swe.71.d:0 "Our decision to keep devaluing the Swedish Krona after it started to have an effect on our economy may have been a mistake. The inflation now started snowballing and everything is showing that the domestic price level will double twice this year. As everyone's monetary possessions are melting away before the sun, we have basically no choice but to abandon our sovereign currency and start again with a new one."
swe.71.a:0 "The Krona is dead! Long live the Krona!"

swe.73.t:0 "The Death of King Gustaf"
swe.73.d:0 "Our dearest sovereign, king Gustaf V of Sweden, has died today in the Stockholm palace as a result of flu complications. A century ago, the crown prince, Gustaf VI Adolf, would be crowned king of Sweden; like his father however, his majesty has opted not to be crowned and instead to take only the Konungaförsäkran - the regal assurance."
swe.73.a:0 "The king is dead, long live the king!"

swe.74.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf V"
swe.74.d:0 "The former royal sovereign of Sweden, Gustaf Bernadotte, has passed away in the estate Bernadotte bought some 40 kilometers outside Stockholm after the loss of the Swedish throne. Still hoping for a restoration, his son Gustaf Adolf Bernadotte has taken over as the pretender to the Swedish throne."
swe.74.a:0 "Rest in peace..."

swe.75.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf V"
swe.75.d:0 "The former royal sovereign of Sweden, Gustaf Bernadotte, has passed away in the estate the Bernadotte family bought some 40 kilometers outside Stockholm after the loss of the Swedish throne. His Majesty king Gustaf VI Adolf, who had been restored to the throne after his grandfather lost it, has personally assured that he will be buried along with the other former kings of Sweden since Gustavus Adolphus in the Riddarholmskyrkan."
swe.75.a:0 "Rest in peace..."

swe.76.t:0 "The Propagandaspeakers"
swe.76.d:0 "The communal government of the capital - probably with encouragement of certain elements in our cabinet - has approved a motion to install loudspeakers with music and state propaganda in all public buildings encouraging the workers to do their part for the Swedish Revolution as well as advocating ideological purity. Many think this would be a great testing environment to see the effectiveness of such a doctrine of total propaganda, but some fear that the effects will be limited and that the enthousiastic approach of the communal government will only be counterproductive."
swe.76.a:0 "Who would we be to meddle with the local government?"
swe.76.b:0 "Tell them to cancel it, this won't work!"

swe.77.t:0 "Mediocre Effect of the Propagandaspeakers"
swe.77.d:0 "The extensive use of propagandaspeakers we let the communal government implement has had a mediocre effect it seems: while indeed the membership of totalist unions has increased marginally more than in the rest of the country, there have been several complaints that the loud noise of the loudspeakers keeps them out of their concentration (at work) or sleep (at night). Several loudspeakers have even been damaged and required replacement. It seems the experiment is moderately unsuccessful."
swe.77.a:0 "Extend the usage to all of Sweden!"
swe.77.b:0 "Have the experiment be abandoned!"

swe.78.t:0 "The Fate of the Press"
swe.78.d:0 "Following the establishment of the worker's state, an imminent problem was the press: most newspapers and as well as the national radio service remained active in the aftermath of the Swedish revolution and some of them even had the gall to criticise the new order.\n\nWhile all factions among the revolutionaries agreed that blatant bourgeoise propagandastations like the capitalist Svenska Dagbladet can obviously not remain active as it is, they all proposed a different approach. The Flyggists of the SP proposed their plan of 'Likriktning': all media in Sweden ought to be put under strict government surveillance to ensure the revolution remains well-protected from reactionary lies. The syndicalists of the SAC had a different proposition: all media should be reorganized in a single newswriters union under the general Swedish Landsorganisationen, which will ensure the content will be objective and not spread falsehoods to the detriment of the socialist order. Finally, the radical socialists of the SSV propose cautiousness; while they agree that obviously reactionary newsmedia should be dissolved, they want us to leave the rest of the media alone."
swe.78.a:0 "Likriktning: protect the revolution!"
swe.78.b:0 "Reorganisation: seize the means of information!"
swe.78.c:0 "Cautiousness: save the freedom of press!"

swe.79.t:0 "The Establishment of the Stasä"
swe.79.d:0 "Many non-totalist socialists were rather dissatisfied with the actions of the SP's paramilitary organisations against reactionaries. By their accounts, the hunt has cost the lives of many who could not even be considered a threat to the revolutionary order, and made it a lot harder to convince Swedes that did not yet subscribe to the revolution that this was really the best way forward.\n\nAs a result of this, they proposed to establish a new agency that would receive the sole authority to protect Sweden from counterrevolutionary activity and with official government support. Somewhat to their surprise, the totalists jumped right on this idea and propose far-reaching powers for this new 'Sekretariatet för Statssäkerhet' - it seems like they are hoping to gain control over it."
swe.79.a:0 "Let the hunt restart with new resources!"
swe.79.b:0 "Institute proper checks and balances."

swe.80.t:0 "Socialisation of the Economy in Practice"
swe.80.d:0 "With the decree from congress clear, the wealth that we took from domestic and foreign capitalist pigs around the Swedish nation is ready to be returned to the Swedish people with interest. Henceforth, the average Swede shall enjoy the prosperity it deserves without being a serf to plutocratic interests!"
swe.80.a:0 "Establish a strong union-based economy!"
swe.80.b:0 "Establish a single union to represent the working class!"
swe.80.c:0 "Establish a autonomous commune-based economy!"

swe.81.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf Bernadotte"
swe.81.d:0 "The nefarious symbol of reaction, Gustaf Bernadotte, who acted as the figurehead for his German reactionary-capitalist puppetmasters' exploitation of Sweden for almost 30 years, has died in exile, while still hoping to some day mend the chains that once shackled the people of Sweden. His son has taken over the mantle as pretender for the 'Swedish throne' and as figurehead for the Swedish exiles."
swe.81.a:0 "Good riddance!"

swe.82.t:0 "The Centralisation of Power"
swe.82.d:0 "After having been installed into power by the worker's mandate, the Totalisterna and now their general secretary immediately went to work. Some of the first actions of Nils Flyg as the general secretary was to relieve those senior officials that were hostile to the totalist thought and the doctrine of total commitments to the revolution from their duty and replacing them with loyal members of the movement."
swe.82.a:0 "You don't belong there if you aren't totally committed!"

swe.83.t:0 "Pacifying the Unions"
swe.83.d:0 "It didn't take long until the apparatus of state had been cleansed of anti-totalism. With the different positions around the government under totalist control, the main political threat to continued unity of Sweden were the unions, that could technically enforce a congress to force a change of government. To prevent crypto-reactionary revisionism from taking root again, the General Secretary announced that union leaders were to be subjected to political tests lest they lead their herd to the wrong end of the spectrum."
swe.83.a:0 "Swedes may not be deceived by revisionists!"

swe.84.t:0 "The Start of Something Greater!"
swe.84.d:0 "After a few months, the hold of the totalist movement over Swedish society had become near total.\nGeneral Secretary Nils Flyg often held speeches to rouse the Swedish people in favour of the national-revolutionary doctrine with his perfected talents for speeching. One day, after such a speech, the 'Folkets Dagblad' which the Swedish leader once redacted started with a front article lauding the great leadership of the General Secretary so far and his wisdom.\n\nThe Article has caught the attention of the leader and his cabinet, who start to consider that letting the media focus on the qualities of Nils Flyg could be politically beneficial."
swe.84.a:0 "Start to work on this 'Cult of Personality'!"
swe.84.b:0 "Our focus should be the revolution, not comrade Flyg!"

swe.85.t:0 "The Creation of a Cult"
swe.85.d:0 "During the last year, news has exacerbated the role of Nils Flyg in the revolution. Comrade Flyg's role in the revolution has become legendary, and it is widely portrayed that it was his decision to defend the revolution from liberals that made it possible to happen. In addition, schools have been instructed to portray Nils Flyg as a true Swedish hero and an example for all to follow and official photographs of the General Secretary adorn the carriages of public transport!"
swe.85.a:0 "Excellent, Comrade Flyg is an example to us all!"

swe.86.t:0 "The Writer's Union Wants to Write a Biography"
swe.86.d:0 "The Writer's Union has let us know that they intend to write a biography about our great leader Nils Flyg, from childhood to today. This is of course a great way to further the popular knowledge about their general secretary, but some discord started to boil over whether we - and comrade Nils in particular - should hold a tight leash on what is being written. Some in the cabinet want us to subject this endeavour under close government control, while others believe that in the knowledge that the Writer's Union is known to be politically correct means it wouldn't become a character assassination, and that if it would turn out in such a way we can always censor it before it is released."
swe.86.a:0 "We need to make sure the truth is written down!"
swe.86.b:0 "Let the writer's write as they would."

swe.87.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.87.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, like how the general secretary already made remarks about the inherent unfairness of the contemporary feudal-capitalist system that held Sweden in chains at the tender age of 8 years old and how bourgeoise spies that infiltrated the workers movement constantly tried to hinder Flyg's career, recognizing that he would liberate the Swedish worker if they couldn't control him, which eventually of course, they couldn't. The book ends in describing the instrumental role Flyg played in the Swedish revolution, which could be considered a departure from the government stance that had been held since the revolution, where the ultimate sacrifice of Per Albin Hansson was accredited as the main event that sowed the seeds for a revolutionary regime."
swe.87.a:0 "An excellent literary artwork!"
swe.87.b:0 "Lies upon lies, cancel the biography!"

swe.88.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.88.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, telling the story from his birth to his rise to power in the present day. In general the book is positive about Flyg's endeavours, praising for instance his capacity to self-educate in his early youth allowing him to rise among the many workers in the socialist movement at the beginning of the 20th century, but also strikes a critical tone at times: for instance the implication is made that the strength of the socialist movement was hurt a lot by Flyg's decision to move forward with his own party, which contributed to the fracturing of Swedish socialism. Indeed the book also puts some weight in criticising the absence of Flyg during the most uncertain hours of the revolution while totalist paramilitaries roamed the streets."
swe.88.a:0 "Criticism is healthy, go ahead!"
swe.88.b:0 "Oh no, I think not!"

swe.89.t:0 "The General Secretary Visits a Workplace"
swe.89.d:0 "In order to bring the touch of the regime closer to the people, the General Secretary, a former industrial worker himself, has arrived to visit a factory where Sweden's industrial heart beats the strongest. One of the civil servants of the secretariat of economics has in the meanwhile drafted a plan to increase the efficiency of factories such as these. One of the junior members of the General Secretary's entourage proposes disposing of the civil servant and bringing the idea as comrade Flyg's own in the ending speech he will give, which would show the wisdom of comrade Flyg to the Swedish people."
swe.89.a:0 "A cunning plan! Make the arrangements."
swe.89.b:0 "Laud the Civil Servant for his achievement!"

swe.90.t:0 "Nils Flyg has a Heart Attack"
swe.90.d:0 "Tragedy: our General Secretary, Nils Flyg, has been hit by a heart attack today. Fortunately, he survived the calamity, but after being rushed to the doctor the doctor explains that Flyg will never be the same again. He will likely suffer from short breath henceforth which will likely become progressively worse in the future. And there is a risk that he will suffer a second heart attack. The doctor recommends that comrade Flyg takes as much rest as possible."
swe.90.a:0 "Rest? The General Secretary of Sweden never rests!"

swe.91.t:0 "The General Secretary's Ill Health Starts to Become Public!"
swe.91.d:0 "Since comrade Flyg's heart attack, his short-breathedness has progressively become worse as the doctor predicted. As a result, the General Secretary eventually caved and dialed down his public appearances, which in turn is feeding the rumour among the Swedish populace that something is wrong with their General Secretary - with the news about the heart attack carefully being censored.\n\nBecause of our... zealous investment in the cult of personality of Nils Flyg, words are spreading that this is the proof that the government is deceiving the Swedish populace, trying to portray Flyg as a God when he is really just a man that can also fall ill."
swe.91.a:0 "Hold a Rally to prove that Flyg is just fine!"
swe.91.b:0 "Time to switch to damage control!"

swe.92.t:0 "The Rally Is Unsuccessful"
swe.92.d:0 "The rally we organised to prove the health of our eternal general secretary has not been able to end the doubts; in fact, the situation has worsened as a result because while the speech started relatively smooth, it was easy to observe that the General Secretary was not well from the very beginning and as the speech continued a clear fatigue overcame the General Secretary. It made one journalist even feel bold enough to want to write that Nils Flyg's life has been shortened by three months by this event. Naturally, this counterrevolutionary scum has swiftly been taken care of."
swe.92.a:0 "I tell you, he is in good health!"

swe.93.t:0 "A Hotel Room has been Requisitioned"
swe.93.d:0 "As the condition of our General Secretary slowly deteriorates, he has become unable to make the daily travel from villa Tomtebo, the home of Flyg he acquired in 1924. As it is important for his duties as General Secretary that he is able to convene with congress and other officials of the Swedish state, he has requisitioned a hotel room close to the Stockholm castle, where the assembly convenes and he has his office. Reportedly he is distressed by the fact that he will for the time being live in a hotel room."
swe.93.a:0 "It's for the good of the country..."

swe.94.t:0 "The Motion Linderot"
swe.94.d:0 "Since the totalist seizure of power, the Swedish congress had become a mere rubberstamping institution for General Secretary Flyg, with little in the way of upsets. The congress was filled with committed totalists, except for about ~30% of the delegates, who were not removed to retain the pretense of democracy and had rallied around Nils Flyg's former associate Karl Kilbom and basically unsuccessfully vote against almost every proposal, with every proposal getting the exact same amount of seats in favour and against since the consolidation of SP control.\n\nThis morning, this atmosphere of political apathy was suddenly crushed: Sven Linderot, the leader of a faction within the SP in favour of greater internationalism and a lesser (European) nationalist doctrine with the party, suddenly pitched a motion to establish a 'Politiska Byrån' - political bureau - to take over the General Secretary's duties on behalf of congress as long as his condition will not allow him to properly exercise said duties. This was swiftly condemned by Flyg loyalists, headed by Arvid Olsson, yet the Kilbommare, witnessing this split in their nemesis, capitalised and supported the motion. For the first time since 1937, a motion against the will of the Flyggists passed."
swe.94.a:0 "How dare they!"

swe.95.t:0 "The Appointment of the 'Politiska Byrån'"
swe.95.d:0 "Following the passing of the Linderot Motion through congress, congress had to elect the delegates that would become members of the bureau. Unsurprisingly, Linderot had pitched his own list with himself as the chairman of the bureau and loyalists for the rest, which would essentially give him all power Flyg previously possessed. The Kilbommare did not cave to that however, and moved to present their own alternative list of syndicalist democracy proponents headed by Kilbom himself. Olsson and the Flyggists were wary of being left the opposition incapable of stopping the motion again, and resolved it would be better to help one of the two sides to the majority they require to take the bureau - hopefully the side that would be the least capable of removing Flyg from power."
swe.95.a:0 "Support Linderot - at least he is Totalist!"
swe.95.b:0 "Support Kilbom - at least he didn't betray us!"

swe.96.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Orders Flyg Be Moved Home!"
swe.96.d:0 "With his hold over the Political Bureau of his own creation, Sven Linderot was given de-facto in control over the country. The first act of the bureau is to have Flyg be moved back to Tomtebo. According to the bureau, this is so the General Secretary can rest, but most consider the real underlying reason is to render Flyg politically pacified. After all, without his hotelroom Flyg can't easily get to the halls of power in a good condition and thus it will be significantly easier for Linderot and his companions to control the country and Flyg's omnipresent supporters. Unsurprisingly, the General Secretary resisted with all the power he had, but the police officers 'to protect him' were relentless."
swe.96.a:0 "It is for your own good, Nisse!"

swe.97.t:0 "The Political Bureau Gathers for the Next Move!"
swe.97.d:0 "With the General Secretary out of the picture, the control of the Political Bureau is unlimited. Now a choice lies before Linderot: either he could announce Flyg's resignation now while Flyg is incapable to react and in poor health, or he could hold his horses, ruling the country for the foreseeable future, taking the gamble that Flyg will not recover and possibly go after him in the future for what he just did."
swe.97.a:0 "Announce Flyg's resignation!"
swe.97.b:0 "Let us remain just where we are!"

swe.98.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.98.d:0 "With Nils Flyg 'resigned' Linderot's own ambitions have been exposed. The Flyggists and mixed totalists, now firmly aware of what Linderot is trying to do and that Flyg's resignation wasn't his own decision, pitch comrade Flyg and exclaim that they will never support 'the rat' Sven Linderot for General Secretary, saying they'll put in even Kilbom into that office before Linderot. The Kilbommare opposition meanwhile, seek to do exactly that, but also among them it is clear, that by the guise of 'better the devil you know' and the consideration that Flyg is in poor shape, they are inclined to support Flyg. Coming in as a dark horse candidate for the position of General Secratary is Sven Olov Lindholm, a hardline Charter Toalist and supporter of General Secretary Flyg; who has often come into conflict with more mainstream Syndicalists. While some decry him as a pseudo reactionary, he appears to have a significant bout of sway considering Kilbom's craven moderatism and Flyg's poor health. It seems Linderot has overplayed his hand; he has lost the race before it even began and knowing that either side won't be soft on him for his attempted powergrab, his supporters are bailing out left and right. The question is however, which side will cave to the other first?"
swe.98.a:0 "Flyg is reelected in the third round!"
swe.98.c:0 "Lindholm is elected in the third round!"
swe.98.b:0 "Kilbom is elected in the third round!"

swe.99.t:0 "The Purge of the Linderot Faction!"
swe.99.d:0 "With the removal of Flyg, the Political Bureau was automatically dissolved too as it was a kind of regency for the General Secretary. As such, Linderot and his loyalists had been planning to invoke the articles included in their motion to reestablish the political bureau. However, these plans were cut short when the authorities arrived at Linderot's doorstep and arrested him on the suspicion of reactionary sympathies. In a show trial the same day he was with hastily convicted to thirty years of hard labour and sent on his way to a prison complex in the north of Sweden specifically designated for enemies of the regime. He was not seen again in Stockholm.\n\nSeveral other staunch Linderot loyalists have been put into custody too. The power of Linderot and his internationalist totalists has been broken."
swe.99.a:0 "Good Riddance!"

swe.100.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Dissolves Congress!"
swe.100.d:0 "With Kilbom in control of the bureau that takes care of the duties of the most important office of the country, the bureau has decreed that the political barriers imposed by General Secretary Flyg earlier are to be removed and had the congress dissolve. In a month's time all delegates of the congress shall face a free election, with no political barriers holding you back from partaking. It is obvious that the Kilbommare are out on getting a congress hostile to totalist rule to commence a recall vote on General Secretary Flyg, to then restore democracy."
swe.100.a:0 "Time to start campaigning!"

swe.101.t:0 "Recall Vote on Nils Flyg"
swe.101.d:0 "After vigorous campaigning, free elections have been held and changed the composition of congress. As such, we are now pitching a recall vote to try and remove Nils Flyg from power, which will let us in turn elect a new General Secretary and safeguard revolutionary democracy in Sweden."
swe.101.a:0 "The recall vote passes, Nils Flyg is removed!"
swe.101.b:0 "The recall vote fails, Flyg remains in power."

swe.102.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.102.d:0 "The syndicalist-democratically aligned congress removed Nils Flyg from his office as General Secretary, which probably helps him more than it hurts him, considering his fragile health. Congress must now elect a new General Secretary however. Most agree that Karl Kilbom - now the saviour of Swedish revolutionary democracy - should become the new General Secretary on behalf of the SSV. The SAC did nominate Frans Severin however and members from both parties have formed an alliance in the hopes of abolishing the office of General Secretary altogether, considering that it only leads to tyranny."
swe.102.a:0 "Kilbom is elected General Secretary."
swe.102.b:0 "Severin is elected General Secretary."

His wife was rushed to his hotelroom as fast as possible but when she arrived it had already been too late - the General Secretary passed away alone. While she lost her husband, Sweden lost its leader, and chaos overtakes congress as a vacuum in power has suddenly spawned out of this as a result. This vacuum was soon filled however: with Linderot and Kilbom having been outplayed earlier and the SP faction reunited, it seems clear who shall become the new chairman of the SP."

For better or for worse though, he was at home at his Tomtebo villa; had he remained in the hotel room that he had been assigned at first, he might well have died alone, without his wife and closest supporters by his side.\n\nCongress was swift in declaring Sven Linderot the second Chairman of Sweden, who had discretely been consolidating his power while ruling in Flyg's place.

As such, the totalist leader had no choice but to wait out the enemy forces, and had been given a cyanide pill to prevent himself from being taken into enemy custody. Sweden is now without a leader in this critical time; we need to select a new General Secretary at once!"
swe.109.a:0 "Olsson is the new General Secretary"

swe.110.t:0 "The End of an Era" #First heart attack happens while Stockholm is occupied
swe.110.d:0 "Nils Flyg has been hit by a heart attack today. While perhaps, under proper care, the man would have survived, Flyg was thanks to the fall of Stockholm in a military camp, where the doctors were already overworked with wounded soldiers, lacked the supplies to help Flyg. He went out peacefully."
swe.110.a:0 "Make Olsson is the new General Secretary"

swe.111.t:0 "Second Swedish Invasion of Åland"
swe.111.d:0 "For a second time, the perfidious Swedes have sent military forces to the Åland archipelago in the Baltic Sea, with the hopes of annexing it. This is a blatantly illegal act, considering our victory in the arbitration of the dispute during the 1920s. However, now that we're under full-scale attack and the verge of collapse, Sweden saw its chance to take what is righfully ours!"
swe.111.a:0 "There is nothing we can do!"
swe.111.b:0 "Request that Germany forces the Swedes to retreat!"
swe.111.c:0 "They must retreat or it is war!"

swe.112.t:0 "Invasion of Åland Successful"
swe.112.d:0 "While the Finns are unsurprisingly rather angry about our rightful takeover of the Åland isles, our move has been successful. The limits opposed in the German arbitration in the 1920s, in which they foolishly ruled in favour of the Finns, meant that military installations on the islands were limited, and we took control over it with little resistance!"
swe.112.a:0 "Welcome back, Åland!"

swe.113.t:0 "Finland Requests our Support!"
swe.113.d:0 "The Finns have been under severe pressure in the ongoing war, and Sweden has ruthlessly taken advantage of that, much like during the Finnish civil war two decades ago. The Finns are imploring us to show that our ruling in the 1920s is to be enforced, and to force the Swedes to retreat, but can we really afford to antagonize the Swedes in the current situation?"
swe.113.a:0 "We can't help here!"
swe.113.b:0 "Demand that Sweden retreats!"


swe.125.t:0 "Sweden Leaves the Reichspakt"

swe.127.t:0 "Discontinuation of the Allmänna Säkerhetstjänsten"
swe.127.d:0 "With the war ending and peace returning to Sweden, the special secret service structure that was established also has run its course. As a result of the desire by politicians to cut the costs, this project will now be ended and the agencies will once again run autonomously."
swe.127.a:0 "This shall help us maintain our budget."

swe.128.t:0 "Rocketry Accident"
swe.128.d:0 "One of our rockets that was being tested in our bid to extend our knowledge surrounding rocketry has been in somewhat of an accident: the trajectory of the rocket, which was supposed to drop into the baltic sea to be recollected by us, had been miscalculated. As a result of this, the rocket has only crashed almost 200km north of its original planned target. Needless to say, local authorities are all over it already."
swe.128.a:0 "I fear that rocket is lost..."

swe.129.t:0 "The Bäckebo Bomb"
swe.129.d:0 "A German missile has crashed in the Swedish woods near Bäckebo, part of one Robert Gustavsson's land, where it left a detonation crater that is five meters wide. Our military has already arrived and taken possession of the wreckage, and it is being transported to Stockholm as we speak to be examined."
swe.129.a:0 "Finders, keepers!"

 swe.130.t: "Gustaf V of Sweden Abdicates the Throne"
 swe.130.d: "In a press release in front of Stockholm Palace today, His Highness King Gustaf V shocked the world by stating he has abdicated the throne of Sweden, dissolving over 115 years of rule by the House of Bernadotte. His Highness is quoted as saying "The elected representatives of the Swedish people have found it necessary to request my abdication. This is not a decision I take lightly, but I will not oppose the will of the people." The Swedish royal family has been granted permission to maintain residency in the country, but must forfeit all royal titles. Members of the royal family including Gustaf's own son and grandson have chosen to flee the country rather than give up their titles. The ruling SAP has in the kings’ stead appointed their leader, Per Albin Hansson as President of the new Swedish Republic. The future of Sweden seems uncertain."
 swe.130.a: "The northern lights dim further."

 swe.131.t: "Swedish Army Declares Martial Law"
 swe.131.d: "In the aftermath of the reformation of Sweden into a socialist republic under the SAP-SSV coalition and the abolishment of the monarchy, General Oscar Nygren and the Swedish Armed Forces under the cover of night swiftly occupied Stockholm this morning, declaring Martial Law across the city. Military Police battalions have been ordered to arrest all socialist politicians related to the Hansson cabinet, as the National Security Forces have mobilised to secure any pockets of socialist resistance. While there have been reports of some bloodshed, it seems the coup has been relatively unopposed. One of General Nygren's first decisions at the helm of the Swedish state was to reinstate the Royal families titles, as well as invite back Gustaf Adolf, grandson of Gustaf V. While Sweden might once again be stable, it remains to be seen what their future holds."
 swe.131.a: "One way or another, order returns to Sweden."

Membership numbers for all parties are exploding, although Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) is the largest one by far. \n\nFrom his podium, Karl Kilbom of the SSV advocates that in the new Sweden, we (the state) look after everyone who needs it, without prying into the affairs of common citizenry. Nils Flyg of Socialistiska partiet (SP) claims that citizenry police needs to be established, to 'safeguard the revolution' while Albert Jensen of Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation (SAC) claims that every commune should look after their own." 
swe_syncon.1.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."

swe_syncon.2.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has assembled for a second time. The initial belief that seizing power in Sweden would unify the left has now completely waned. Reforming the economy of Sweden is the topic of the day, and speaking sharply for the SSV is Anna Johansson Visborg, claiming that strong unions and government influence will secure worker's rights. \n\nThe SP representative, Sven Linderot, claims that all workers should be gathered into a single, large union, and a the focus should be on massive state funded projects. Finally, Gustav Sjöström of the Syndicalists proposes the idea of commune based economy, where every region should strive to be self-sufficient."

Zeth Höglund of the SSV wants to reintegrate the Swedish army through education of staff and soldiers, where soldiers council's should elect officers out of their own ranks. \n\nGustav Johansson from SP claims that a strong army needs a strong central command, and that a National School for politically indoctrinated officers must be the backbone of our new army. The SAC representative, Nisse Lätt, believes armies should be trained and used for local, defensive deployment and only summoned elsewhere for extreme situations."

Our new society must build upon equality, a strong union and compassion for your fellow man, or so claims Östen Unden of SSV. \n\nHilding Hagberg from SP believes that we must put faith in a strong man to lead us all into an era where Sweden isn't just a strong nation, it's a great nation, rivaled by none and feared by all! The most passionate of all speakers however is the SAC representative Elise Ottosen Jensen, who envisions her dream of a society free of oppression, where one cares and shares with your local community."

swe_flavor.1.t:0 "Karin Boye Releases För Lite."
swe_flavor.1.d:0 "Karin Boye, a prominent author, poet and female rights activist coloured by socialism has just released her latest piece. It's a novel called För Lite (Too Little or For Little) and centres around the themes of working to achieve your dreams or make your ends meet, and your responsibility to yourself as a person and to your family and friends. Boye is very popular and somewhat controversial, having divorced her husband and engaged in a romantic relationship with the German Margot Hanel. Often engaged in political work alongside taking care of her unrequited lover Anita Nathorst, currently suffering from breast cancer, Boye writes fervently about life death and also heroism. Well known in Swedish literary circles, Boye’s novel sells like butter."

swe_flavor.2.t:0 "Greta Garbo Stars in Camille."
swe_flavor.2.d:0 "Greta Garbo stars in the American produced movie Camille, a romantic drama. Greta Garbo is one of the biggest names in the movie industry, both in Sweden and in the world. The movie is rather harmless and holds a high quality production but some of the more conservative elements of our society are most upset... Her clothes are a bit revealing! They are calling for a censorship. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.2.a:0 "That outfit is too revealing! Censor it!"
swe_flavor.2.b:0 "It seems most entertaining. Send me a ticket!"

swe_flavor.3.t:0 "Five Year Commemoration of Ådalen"
swe_flavor.3.d:0 "In May 1931 a large march of strikers marched towards barracks for blacklegs who were working at local factories. The police had called in the military for support and before the day was over, the riots had ended in five strikers being killed by military fire. Ever since then yearly marches are held in memory of the dead workers among socialists, although conservatives claim that the workers were armed and attacked them first. The strikes of this year are unusually large. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.3.a:0 "Let them. They'll tire eventually."
swe_flavor.3.b:0 "Wasn't once enough? Send in the military!"

swe_flavor.4.t:0 "Final Sentence of the Sala-gang"
swe_flavor.4.d:0 "In the summer of last year a gang led by a name called Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman (a name he added himself, presumably because it is an anagram for Manhunter) was arrested for a murder. Soon the investigations reached nationwide front news as it turned out that the gang was not only guilty of murders dating all the way back to 1931, but also because it was ran more or less like an occult group and went under the nickname 'The Magic circle''. \n\nThe leader and the conspirators were sentenced in court the other day, most of them to life in prison but the leader was considered so mentally ill that he was sentenced to closed psychiatric care. Many people are outraged, and would have wanted to see Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman put away for good!"
swe_flavor.4.a:0 "We must respect the court's decision. Closed care it is."
swe_flavor.4.b:0 "Arrange for this monster to be relocated to a prison."

swe_flavor.5.t:0 "Manhunter on the Loose!"
swe_flavor.5.d:0 "Two years ago, Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman was sentenced to closed psychiatric care but our politicians overruled the decisions and put him in prison. In prison his mental state reportedly worsened, and just after Christmas last year he broke out and murdered a taxi driver and stole his car. The police lacks any good leads and fear he may have gone underground or even left the country..."
swe_flavor.5.a:0 "What have I done?!"

swe_flavor.6.t:0 "Major Hotel Strike!"
swe_flavor.6.d:0 "After failed negotiations with the unions a major hotel strike has caused a hotel lockout in Sweden. From Stockholm to Göteborg to Malmö you won't find a single hotel which is properly staffed. Striking down at the protestors violently could disperse them... or set off a backlash, while negotiation with them could make the red parties grow. We could just ignore them, but that might hurt our economy, at least for a while."
swe_flavor.6.a:0 "Let's replay Ådalen, send in the military!"
swe_flavor.6.b:0 "Let's negotiate with them."
swe_flavor.6.c:0 "Ignore them. Surely it will stop?"

swe_flavor.7.t:0 "City Massacre"
swe_flavor.7.d:0 "Our brave soldiers nobly defended the government directives when the strikers, reds and other rabble started throwing bottles and rocks. The turmoil and riots lasted for the entire day and over a dozen workers have been killed before the protestors were fully cleared. For some reason a couple of journalists managed to leak pictures of bleeding civilians in the streets of Göteborg, and now Sweden is in shock!"
swe_flavor.7.a:0 "If they had only stayed home..."

swe_flavor.8.t:0 "The Hotel Strike Ends"
swe_flavor.8.d:0 "For several months the strike has been going on, hurting our economy and our prestige, but eventually we tired them out. The strikes have ended and things are back to normal... For now."

swe_flavor.9.d:0 "The legend of Gösta Ekman, Sweden's most popular actor and theatre-director, passed away at age 47 after a period of sickness. In the last eleven years, Ekman was part of no less than twenty three productions. Following his funeral train in the streets of Stockholm, over 100 000 (!) people, roughly a fifth of the city, watched the coffin pass and mourned the end of a Swedish legend."
swe_flavor.9.a:0 "We all mourn today."

swe_flavor.10.t:0 "Astrid Kindstrand on the Radio"
swe_flavor.10.d:0 "A few days ago, Astrid Kindstrand read the news on Sweden's Radio, the national radio channel, the first woman to do so in Swedish history. In the following days, hundreds of angry phonecalls and letters reached the state and various newspapers across the country to complain that a woman is allowed to read state news."
swe_flavor.10.a:0 "Don't they have anything else to be upset about?"

swe_flavor.11.t:0 "Landstormens Lilla Lotta"
swe_flavor.11.d:0 "A new Swedish comedy movie has hit the theatres and reached a surprising amount of popularity. It plays a bit with the traditional story of Romeo and Julia but also throws things of order upside down, such as making the bank director a private when he joins the army and the groundskeeper a commander. Everyone fools around and no one takes their military training seriously while falling in love with one of the pretty women of the Lotta-corps."
swe_flavor.11.a:0 "Oh ho ho! I love me some jolly movies!"
swe_flavor.11.b:0 "How dare they mock the Swedish military like this?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.12.t:0 "Garbo Skrattar - Ninotchka!"
swe_flavor.12.d:0 "Garbo laughs - That is how the movie is marketed all across the world, as the Swedish, beautiful mega-star Greta Garbo does her first attempt at a comedy movie. The movie centres around Garbo in the role of Ninotchka, an ice-cold syndicalist who finds love and abandons her political ideas to move to a capitalist society. Even though it is tounge-in-cheek, and makes fun of the capitalist society too, it is clear that it mocks all forms of syndicalism."
swe_flavor.12.a:0 "She is so beautiful! Get me a ticket!"
swe_flavor.12.b:0 "How dare they mock the glorious Swedish revolution?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.13.t:0 "Kallocain Released"
swe_flavor.13.d:0 "Kallocain is a novel written by the ever busy Karin Boye. It takes place in a dystopian, fictive nation where critizising the state is strictly illegal and the state controls every single part of your life. It reflects on men and women, on class issues and the conflicts that arise from these issues. It is, ultimately, a depressing read. It takes brutal stabs at any totalitarian regimes, left or right."
swe_flavor.13.a:0 "A fascinating and disturbing read!"
swe_flavor.13.b:0 "How dare she mock the strong, glorious state? Censor it!"

swe_flavor.14.t:0 "Death of Karin Boye"
swe_flavor.14.d:0 "Karin Boye was found lifeless on a hill north of Alingsås after she had, seemingly intentionally, overdosed on sleeping pills. Killing herself on the same hill where her friend-lover Nathorst loves to visit, Boye’s move is clearly motivated. Always known for her emotional side, the last few years have truly only made her feelings more intense, as years of hard political work, writing novels and caring for her lovers has put their scars on her psyche. Dissatisfied with the political evolution of the country, relationship woes with her lover Hanel and the slow death of her other love interest Nathorst pushed the young writer finally over the edge. Her sexuality was a public secret, and the pressure of it all might have been too much, despite her family being accepting of her sexuality. Shortly after Karin took her own life, Nathorst died of her cancer, and Hanel, distraught and alone in a country not of her own, and with her family back home disowning her, ended her life."
swe_flavor.14.a:0 "A tragic outcome."

swe_flavor.17.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many as a father of the Nation. The former admiral reigned as prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nIt is said that Bagge rarely took any decisions without asking for advice from the senior Lindman, but no longer. A public funeral will be held and attended by the King and other people of fine birth."

swe_flavor.18.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many to be a tyrant who did everything he could to kill democracy and socialism in it's cradle. He reigned as a prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge. \n\nWhen our revolutionary government proclaimed Sweden to be a republic, he was among the first to flee abroad and he died, alone and unwanted, in a flat in Berlin."

The project has adopted the name 'Valkyriorna', after the winged women of ancient norse mythology who oversaw which warriors would be slain on the battlefield. Women have gathered in droves to sign up, wanting the chance to fight for Sweden, but the idea is not undisputed. Many feel that women in the army is not fitting with a modern civilised nation."

swe_flavor.21.d:0 "The arrival of Black Monday has hit Swedish society hard, but nowhere quite as badly as in the furthest north. With the collapse of the global economy, the mines and related industries that kept the region going have been forced to close, putting most of the population out of work. As bad as this situation is already, there are reports of people going missing, dropping all their belongings and heading out of house and home, disappearing into the wilderness. While the police are preoccupied dealing with worker unrest and growing crime, the government itself will have to solve the case. \n\nA commission has been formed to investigate the disappearances, with the only common denominator being absolute poverty."

The commission tasked to track then down have finally presented a report on their findings, and it is a properly grim read. \n\nWhen Black Monday struck and the mines closed, the poor and destitute caught wind of a development not too far away, in Russian Karelia. Here, it was promised that industrious Swedes would be hired to do good work for good pay, building roads, establishing communities, all while being guaranteed days of rest, even to visit Sweden during semester. It was not to be. \n\nShortly after arrival in Karelia they became targets of the local secret police. After days of hard work, the men would be grabbed out from their homes for interrogation, most of them never to be seen again. The children were put in schools where there was little to no food available, and getting medical care meant walking for miles through scorching summers and terrifying winters. When the promised semester arrived, one family were horrified to find out that the promise of being sent back home did not apply to their children, who were forced into an orphanage until their return. \n\nWhile a slow trickle of returnees arrive at our borders, telling tales of horror and abuse, perhaps the most haunting tales have yet to be shared, the keepers of which are trapped in Siberia, in prisons, or in the ground."

The unskilled labourers became employed by the government to build roads from a village called Ukhtah all the way to Kem, whereas those skilled in mining ended up employed in Hibinogorsk, some distance from Murmansk, all receiving their pay and promised privileges.

For Björn von Rosen however, young scion of the noble family, nature is his main passion. Unlike his brother Carl Gustaf von Rosen, an active pilot and daredevil mercenary, Björn has a passion for animals of all stripes and colours, in particular dogs. \n\nGrowing up, Björn was always infatuated with a strange type of short stocky yet surprisingly lean dog that occupied most of the farms in his area. Small and somewhat fluffy, eager to bark and protect livestock, it had a distinctive look about it that-to Björn at least-means that its surely a breed of dog worth preserving. Sadly however, Björn has not seen such a dog in several decades. Still, as an aristocrat with a passion for nature, Björn von Rosen brought the matter up with fellow nature enthusiast and dog-enjoyer K-G Zetterstén, who has decided to join Björn on a bicycle trip throughout the countryside to save this lost canine."

Already it is believed that this dog, the newly minted Svensk Vallhund, is in fact an ancient breed even used by the old vikings! While the Svenska Kennelklubben-the authority on all things canine-argues on if the breed should be named simply Svensk Vallhund or Västgötaspets, von Rosen has recently heard word of another breed that needs saving, further up north."

swe_flavor.28.d:0 "For close to two decades now a fervent debate has been raging within the halls of the Svenska Kennelklubben. On one side stands the advocates of a breed they call Jämthund, and on the other side stands those who deem it simply a mutt. Too large to count as simply a variant of the Norwegian Elkhound, yet too small to be some kind of fighting dog, the advocates of the Jämthund want to put it into the books as its own independent breed. Now, bolstered by his uncovering of the shorter Svensk Vallhund, von Rosen has joined in the debate, supporting the fervent advocate Aksel Lindström, famed painter. \n\nArguing that the breed is unique and not just a variation from Norwegian stock, Lindström presents several arguments as to why the dog is special, how different it is, and how the people in Jämtland use it. Indeed, Lindström also tell a macabre fairytale about how the breed is descended from a large dog owned by king Olav of Norway, and thus also of viking make. For Lindström it is very much a personal matter, as he has ventured through the countryside tracking down individual dogs not unlike that of von Rosen and Zetterstén. Following his inventory Lindström bought as many dogs as he could of the breed he had seen in his youth, and claims to have singlehandedly saved the breed from extinction, constantly swarmed by thirty or so dogs at his home. It is this commitment that first alerted von Rosen to the cause of the Jämthund, which allowed the debate over the breed to go national. As the debate rages on, the fate of the breed lies in balance."

For Lindström this is indeed a very personal matter. Having seen the breed go from prevalent in his youth to just a few handful spread out across a landscape so vast, he has almost singlehandedly saved it. As one can expect, the man is deemed a hero by his supporters, and his detractors have all conveniently become mute following the decision from the Svenska Kennelklubben to admit the breed into its ranks."

swe_flavor.30.d:0 "Over the past months our government began to receive concerning news regarding strange occurences and mysterious movements of unidentified people around the Helgasjön lake in Småland. Although undocumented people are nothing out of the ordinary in a land as vast as Sweden, and are usually left to their own devices if they do constitute any danger to the security of the state, this particular case would prove to be extraordinary. The first unusual reports were marked with mentions of organized bands venturing to the nearest countryside and seemingly ‘scouting out’ villages, at the same time brandishing old rifles and Weltkrieg era uniforms. After the mayor of Växjö, the largest city of the local municipality, dispatched the constabulary to investigate the lawmen tracked down the suspects to the ruins of the Kronoberg Castle, now transformed into a provisional base of operations for this new militia.\n\nThe organizers of this whole endeavour turned out to be British nationalists, monarchists, and other assorted radical rightist exiles who willingly sailed from the Union in recent years and have been wandering Europe in search of support ever since. When questioned, the leader of the group - supposedly a native Swede identifying himself as ‘Det Härliga Lejonet’ (The Glorious Lion) - explained that his chapter of National Unity Party of the Swedish Realm was contacted by the Right Club (a well-known English Nordicist, racialist, and anti-semitic movement) affiliates seeking fraternal cooperation in their struggle against degenerative socialism. As far as the mayor could discover, the foreigners’ contingent was headed by the man called ‘The Golden One’, or Sē Gyldenan Ænne in their preferred Old English.\n\nDespite the claims of being ‘normal people’ that have come to ‘Earth, the North, Mother Svea’ the group dubbed ‘The Northern Brothers’ by local reporters has the capacity to cause trouble if left unattended. Their hatred for everything that would try to, as they themselves claim, rob them from culture, nation, and civilization may transform into dangerous warlordism reeking havoc across nearby settlements.

After first becoming renowned for being the first female motorist to cross the Sahara in her trip from Nairobi to Stockholm alongside her driver-mechanic Hassan Ali, Eva decided ona great trek once more. The new goal? The Silk Road. Having recently published her book 'An Eva in Sahara' about her adventures in Africa, Eva has been bit by the bug of exploration and travel, something fostered and cultivated by her husband and fellow adventurer Bror von Blixen-Finecke, as well as their mutual friend Ernest Hemingway. Following the marriage between Eva and Bror, and a long trip on Hemingway's boat the 'Pilar', Eva declared her urge to take the path of Sven Hedin, and make the long journey all the way to China. The trip however, has so far been a rough one. Since crossing into the Middle East Eva has been plagued by not just disease, but bandits and robbers, and the journey has proven far more expensive than first planned. So far she's managed to arrive in Calcutta, but before she was able to plan for the next leg of the journey, poor Eva fell ill with a mysterious illness.\n\nNaturally, the proscribed solution to Eva's mysterious illness was a cure of arsenic, something that naturally poisoned the adventurer, ending the journey in India, though perhaps for the best. Although India itself is not exactly peaceful, trapped in a three way never-ending civil war, China is in a much worse state. The Qing have once again collapsed into anarchy, the Silk Road is shut for the foreseeable future, and Eve has simply had enough of the whole mess. Already, though still constrained by her hospital bed and with funds running low, Eva is planning on a journey once again through Africa, a much more peaceful continent compared to Asia. \n\n'I believe, that the person who is once captured by the spell of Africa, can never again be free. There you come in intimate contact with nature, magical and by human contact unsullied, and on my part I believe that's where Africa's greatest charm lies.'"

swe_flavor.32.d:0 "Dogs are a mans best friend, this is a fact. Dogs can be trained, can be given basic tasks, and as the weltkrieg showed, can positively influence the outcome of battles. As such, according to psychologists Valdemar Fellenius and Gunnar Boalt, it should not be a stretch to imagine seals as mans best friend in the ocean, which is why they've pitched a somewhat hairbrained scheme involving seals as submarine spotters. Although a strange prospect, Fellenius and Boalt have somehow or another managed to achieve funding from the navy, been given staff from Skansen Zoo in Stockholm, and their very own secret island, Gålö. \n\nCodenamed 'Palmen', Fellenius and his staff will be mostly isolated on the island for an undetermined amount of years, working in outmost secrecy, all in an effort to create a seal proof environment for training and testing. Around twenty seals have been gathered for this task, ranging from grey seals to harbor seals, and plenty of energy has been invested in creating a good enough habitat for them to thrive in. A vast disguised pool has been created for them to be housed in, allowing them free access to normal sea water, and the seals are routinely fed, both as part of simple sustenance and training. Although a strange scheme, Fellenius' own investment of funds into the project as well as the navy's desperation to devise a good counter-submarine system has in fact sealed the deal. Fellenius and his family will reside on Gålö together with around a handful of secrecy-sworn co-workers, ranging from a chef to animal handlers, divers to dedicated guards. Already a few of the seals have become known for their attentiveness and efficiency in training, like Pottifar, Lotta, Bigge and Pelle."

swe_flavor.33.d:0 "Deep in the heart of Stockholms archipelago, seals are hard at work. In the deepest part of the bay, surrounded by seaweed and debris, rests a submarine to be detected. At surface, being outfitted with a specially made harness armed with carbide lamp buoys, the seal Pelle is preparing for action. After being motivated with fish and a cheerful command, Pelle dives into the water, scanning the seabed, vanishing from sight. Silence. Where's the seal? Where's Pelle? Minutes go by, birds caw, the wind picks up. Has Fellenius accidentally just let a seal run wild, accidentally let it free forever? The silence is deafening... 'PLOP!' Poking up its head in the distance, Pelle dashes towards Fellenius and company, eager and energetic. It rushes up the ramp, practically charging the serviceman tasked to feed it, almost knocking him over in the process. A quick inspection of the harness reveals the outcome of the operation: One of the identification buoys is no longer attached to the harness, and after some fiddling with the binoculars, the signal is spotted, being attached directly to the submarine, lamp-buoy now gently bobbing on the surface. Pelle is todays champion, if not the entire projects champion, and as such is granted many treats. \n\nWhile Pelle is being treated with adoration and affection, Fellenius and company feel nothing but the great joy of success. Years of hard work, long days of endless training and far too many tonnes of fish to even remember, has finally paid off. As the submarine in the distance rises to the surface, buoy still attached, it would appear the project has absolutely been vindicated. The seals, wearing harnesses fitted with a mixture of radio connected, as well as lamp attached buoys, can be trusted to not just identify a submarine, but to press up against wiring mounted on the vessel, in the process hooking one or more buoys directly to the seafaring craft. Not only that, the seal is able to swim away from the vessel once the task is done, not loitering around and risking danger from mines or bombs. Indeed, once the buoy is mounted to the ship itself, all that is required to disable the vessel is one properly adjusted depth charge. After tests with all twenty seals, only one seal failed to attach a buoy to target, which is in effect viewed as a statistical anomaly. \n\nPelle himself is an interesting specimen. Taken while young from the Bothnian Bay like most of the other seals, Pelle soon found himself showered with attention and energy due to his friendly energetic personality. Eager to socialize, eager to be active with others both seal and man, Pelle is viewed as the posterchild of the secret project. Also known as Flygar-Pelle, Flying Pelle, the little seal once found himself on a long airplane journey by accident, only being recovered once the plane was back in its hangar. Unlike the other seals however, Pelle is not viewed as being fit for release back into nature once the project is over, and has been earmarked by the Skansen Zoo staff to join them back in Stockholm."

Born in November 1939, Nicke was soon drafted to the navy as a ship's dog, and stationed on the warship. When just two months old he first arrived on the warship and achieved the grade of seaman second class. In his service book it is mentioned that, on arrival, his profession was 'puppy', unmarried, and his character was that of a wire fox terrier. Since joining the crew on the warship, Nicke was placed in the 'second dog company', was allowed to wander around on deck, and even got work as a dishwasher. This position was however not very fitting for Nicke, who'd often end up in fierce arguments with the chef over leftovers. When stationed on land during leave, Nicke would be housed by the junior flag officer. \n\nEventually Nicke would be transferred to the battery, and was sent to a dedicated ship's dog school, later transferred to the same school as the other trainees. Apparently Nicke became so skilled at being a member of the battery, that before firing began, he'd rush around deck barking to alert everyone. After a period of great service Nicke was promoted to ship's dog second class, but soon lost his position after repeated poor behaviour. Indeed, during the Swedish championship in bandy, Nicke became so enthralled by the spectacle that he rushed out to play with the rest of the competitors. Furthermore, Nicke soon enough lost his lead in Strömstad, and rushed around town barking, rolling around in mud, and being a general nuisance. Eventually Nicke became a much calmer dog, got his own uniform made, and has served the navy properly ever since. Renowned for his friendly demeanour and great swimming ability, Nicke is a fond sight for all."

swe_flavor.35.t:0 "Death of the Skogfinnar "
swe_flavor.35.d:0 "The Finnish diaspora in Sweden is quite large and varied, but perhaps the most forgotten section of it are the skogsfinnar or metsäsuomalaiset in Finnish, original inhabitants of the Swedish-Norwegian border who arrived to the region in the late 1500s under policies of resettlement enacted by Karl IX. The main draw for these policies was the fact that many Swedish people had already settled in those regions but only around the riverbeds, and thus the Finns, mostly from woodland areas of the Swedish Kingdom’s eastern half, such as Savolax and Tavastland, were brought in to populate the wooded areas left empty by the Swedes themselves. A subculture of these Forest Finns would develop in their isolated situation, and they rarely interacted with the wider Finnish population in the homeland or in the areas of Sweden populated by Finns. Some would end up in Nya Sverige, the Swedish colony in the New World, usually after being imprisoned. \n\nThe skogfinnar culture began to die off after the Swedish authorities ramped up assimilation of them into the majority population, with the ban on the use of Finnish language being the most major contributor. The skogfinnar, who relied on slash-and-burn agriculture, had already been on the decline due to a previous ban on that form of agricultural expansion, originally implemented because the charcoal used by skogfinnar was valuable to the fledgling iron industry of Sweden. \n\nAt the dawn of 20th century, skogfinnar were nearly extinct bar for a few remaining speakers, and these select few survivors became a source of great interest to the newly independent Finnish state. This interest was recently increased after the death of a prominent skogfinnar, Kaisa Vilhuinen, who was known internationally because of her interviews with the Finnish folk researcher Lauri Kettunen. Vilhuinen participated in numerous interviews with Kettunen and a few other Finnish researchers and writers, and her knowledge of Finnish mythology, folk tradition and old skogfinnar customs was celebrated among Finnish academia. Her reputation as a witch and local wisewoman had been a common point of suspicion to Swedish authorities, but this only added to the mystique for Finns. With her death, an important remaining crumb of knowledge of the skogfinnar leaves this world, and it is estimated that the rest of the minority group only has a generation or two at best left until total extinction."

swe_flavor.36.d:0 "The northern territories of Sweden are remote and sparsely populated regions, and the connection between Stockholm and the northernmost regions of Lapland is hardly a well-maintained or oft traveled one. However, on rare occasions, news do trickle down from the far north, and rarely are they as bizarre as the most recent tale to arrive down to Stockholm. According to a local official’s report, a cult has emerged among the people of Northern Sweden, started originally by a Finnish preacher Toivo Korpela but actually evolved into a full-blown sect by his follower Sigurd Siikavaara. The Finnish branch of Lutheranism known as Laestadinism has been the main incubator for this odd movement, as it is the most popular movement among the Christians of Lapland.\n\nKnown for being a rather conservative and insular branch of Lutheranism, Laestadianism is popular in Western and Northern parts of Finland and Sweden, and has a rather large following among the Sámi people. The newly dubbed Korpela movement has emerged among that rather traditionalist strain of Lutheranism, but one would be hard-pressed to find traditionalism among the Korpelaists. The new movement, among other things, preaches that the Anti-Christ has landed on the Earth and will spend 1335 days on it, and only those who follow the Korpela Movement, according to Siikavaara numbering around 664 or 666 people, will fly on a crystal ark to Palestine.\n\nCuriously enough, prophet Siikavaara has claimed that the ark was supposed to arrive during the winter of 1935, yet no such heavenly creation has been forthcoming. The movement is known for holding large rallies in towns such as Kiiruna and Luulaja, popular especially among the local Finns and Sámi. These rallies often involve a local woman, often a teenager, staring at the faces of the gathered crowd, and if she sees someone’s face as black, she will call them possessed by the devilry, an ailment that can be only resolved by stepping on the church stairs and shouting insults at the devil.\n\nThe movement has been mostly considered harmless, though locals and even Korpela himself, consider it a form of millenarian heresy with potentially dangerous consequences. Some local policemen have tended to agree, and some members of the Korpela movement have been imprisoned, with clashes between the police and movement members occurring over attempts to free the prisoners. The news of the movement have reported that as Siikavaara continues to haemorrhage support, he is becoming increasingly eccentric, and his recent forced visit to a mental hospital has seemingly only escalated the matter. There are rumours of the movement developing into an even more esoteric direction, though whether these are substantiated in reality or mere speculation and hyperbole remains to be seen."

Despite growing concerns over political radicalization across Europe, the Swedish people have once again demonstrated their commitment to parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy. Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson's Social Democratic Party has emerged as the clear victor, securing a strong mandate to continue their policies of social welfare, neutrality, and economic reform.\n\nFears that the far-left Socialistiska Samlingspartiet Vänster (SSV) might gain ground proved unfounded, as the party failed to secure a single seat in the Riksdag. This outcome has allowed Hansson to confidently rule out any coalition with the extremists, thereby reinforcing Sweden’s political stability in these uncertain times.\n\nWith the support of the monarchy and a firm popular backing, Sweden now looks to the future with cautious optimism. Hansson's administration is expected to focus on modernizing infrastructure, strengthening social programs, and maintaining neutrality amidst the rising tide of Syndicalism across Europe. Whether this course will hold steady in the face of global upheaval remains to be seen."

However, their plan unraveled as many rank-and-file soldiers defected and joined the burgeoning workers' militia. In the early morning, fighting broke out near the Riksdag, but the uprising was swiftly quelled. The rogue generals were arrested, their ambitions crushed by the very soldiers they once commanded.\n\nAlthough the revolution has solidified the SSV’s grip on power, cracks are already beginning to show within the revolutionary movement itself.

At dawn, troops marched on Stockholm, surrounding the Riksdag. A brief but brutal firefight erupted as loyalist militias attempted to defend the socialist government. Outgunned and outmaneuvered, they fell quickly.\n\nBy mid-morning, radio stations and newspapers across the country broadcast the military's declaration, the Riksdag was dissolved, a provisional military council had assumed authority, and a national purge of 'red elements'. Across the country, mass arrests targeted prominent socialists, trade unionists, and suspected dissidents. While many had hoped for the restoration of the monarchy or a return to democratic governance, the military has made no such promises. Prince Gustaf Adolf remains absent from public affairs, and there are whispers that the generals see no place for a king in their new Sweden. For now, the country marches to the beat of the army's drum."

The world watches as this unprecedented power rises."

### Decisions ###
SWE_fix_black_monday_category:0 "Response to Black Monday"
SWE_fix_black_monday_category_desc:0 "The Swedish economy is tightly connected to the German one, and as such, the economic downturn in Berlin soon found its way to the purses of the average Swede. As such, the prime minister has appointed a Crisis Commission under the minister of finance to prevent Sweden from ailing away under the effects. With unemployment rising and tax returns shrinking this will surely be a daunting task, however.\n\nFree Budget: [swedishBudgetAmount] kronor.\nInflation: [?swe_var_inflation|%-0].\nUnemployment: [?swe_var_unemployment|%R0].\nRelated debt: [swedishDebtAmount] kronor."
SWE_drop_gold_standard:0 "Drop the Gold Standard"
SWE_drop_gold_standard_desc:0 "The Swedish national bank, the Riksbank, is held to convert Swedish Kronor into gold at standardised value by law. We can suspend the standard however, as per the instruments of government in times of financial ruin, which will make Swedish goods easier to sell internationally, but also cause inflation."
SWE_print_extra_money:0 "Print extra money"
SWE_print_extra_money_desc:0 "We can order the Riksbank to print us extra money to spend. However, this may cause the value of the Kronor to drop."
SWE_take_a_loan:0 "Borrow 2 million Kronor"
SWE_take_a_loan_desc:0 "We can take a loan of 2 million Kronor to add to our budget, but this can not be done indefinitely."
SWE_repay_a_loan:0 "Repay 2 million Kronor"
SWE_repay_a_loan_desc:0 "We can repay 2 million Kronor from our budget, so we won't have to pay interest over it anymore."
SWE_cut_funding_on_military:0 "Cut Military Funding"
SWE_cut_funding_on_military_desc:0 "We can save quite a bit of money by cutting the funding of the military. The world is becoming ever less stable however, so such a decision should not be taken lightly. In addition, the Swedish conservatives are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_raise_taxes:0 "Raise Taxes"
SWE_raise_taxes_desc:0 "We can bring in some extra money to spend on countering Black Monday by raising some extra taxes. This may stifle the market even further however, and the Swedish liberals are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_cut_welfare:0 "Cut Welfare Funding"
SWE_cut_welfare_desc:0 "We can save quite a bit of money by cutting on welfare expenditure. Such a move may deny those that have been hit the hardest by the crisis a much-needed lifeline, and, unsurprisingly, the Swedish Social Democrats are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_public_work_program:0 "Start a Public Works Program"
SWE_public_work_program_desc:0 "The most straightforward way to combat unemployment is to kickstart large public works projects the unemployed can participate in. They can then use the money they earn with this to take care of their families. As an added bonus, the money they spend will enter the economy and help it recover."
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports:0 "Subsidize Raw Resource Export"
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports_desc:0 "A large part of the Swedish economy relies on the export of raw resources such as iron ore and tungsten. By subsidizing these exports, we will find our fair amount of foreign currency flowing our way, which will aid our recovery significantly."
SWE_nationalize_company:0 "Nationalize a Major Company"
SWE_nationalize_company_desc:0 "Fact is that the goals of major companies are often aimed at making the most profit rather than providing as many people as possible with a living. To that end it might be worthwhile to nationalize one of these major companies and redirect it towards that goal. This will not be cheap, however."
SWE_implement_tariffs:0 "Implement Tariffs"
SWE_implement_tariffs_desc:0 "We can try protecting our own economy by implementing tariffs against the cheap goods that enter Sweden while bringing in some money as well. We are part of Mitteleuropa however, which is a free-trade area; as such, this is technically a violation of our international obligations."
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission:0 "Wrap up the Crisis Commission"
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission_desc:0 "The Crisis Commission was established in the 1936 Crisis Act to help Sweden combat the effects of Black Monday. Once the crisis is over and everything has been properly dealt with, we can wrap up the commission."
SWE_repay_leftovers:0 "Repay [?swe_var_debt|1] million Kronor"
SWE_repay_leftovers_desc:0 "We can repay the rest of our debt from our budget, so we won't have to pay interest over it anymore."
SWE_counter_inflation:0 "Increase the Riksbank Interest"
SWE_counter_inflation_desc:0 "Banks in Sweden take loans from the Riksbank. By increasing the interest over these loans, we can influence the money supply and lower our inflation once."

SWE_geopolitical_actions:0 "Geopolitical Actions"
swe_join_reichspakt:0 "Join the Reichspakt"
swe_join_reichspakt_desc:0 "With the dangers of syndicalism ever encroaching towards Swedish borders, it would be prudent to look to likeminded powers. The Kaiserreich is the champion of the status quo, and a fellow Germanic nation withstanding the tides of Latin anarchy. Let us stand together in battle!"
swe_join_internationale:0 "Join the Third Internationale"
swe_join_internationale_desc:0 "The dangers to the young revolutionary republic are many, with the fat kaiser viciously looking to end the worker's freedom in its neighbouring countries in its cradle. We should stand together with our Comrades in France and Britain against this menace!"
swe_leave_reichspakt:0 "Leave the Reichspakt"
swe_leave_reichspakt_desc:0 "We have come to the conclusion that the political climate that was in place when Sweden decided to enter into an alliance with the Germans is no more, and that the alliance is now hampering our goals more than it is aiding it."
swe_leave_internationale:0 "Leave the Third Internationale"
swe_leave_internationale_desc:0 "In the recent past, the Internationale has unfortunately been moving into a direction that is incompatible with the Swedish doctrine of socialism of European origin that is spreading around the world. The sad truth is that the main worker's alliance is moving towards a dead end and Sweden will not follow it into the ravine."
swe_seize_aland:0 "Invade Åland"
swe_seize_aland_desc:0 "We tried to secure Åland at the end of the Weltkrieg when Finland and Russia's fate were still not clear. German pressure eventually forced us to retreat, despite our righteous mandate with over 80% of the archipelago's population wishing to join Sweden, and resolved the dispute in their Finnish puppet state's favour. An opportunity might arise to bring the islands into their rightful homeland once more, be that for strategic or nationalist reasons."
swe_subjugate_neighbours: "Subjugate [FROM.GetName]"
swe_subjugate_norway_desc: "The Norwegians have enjoyed their independence long enough. It is time for Sweden to reclaim its birthright as the country that dominates and shapes the Scandinavian geopolitical scene and a Norway that doesn't bend the knee to Stockholm does not constitute a proper part of the new Nordic order."
swe_subjugate_finland_desc: "Finland has historically been under Swedish dominion ever since the Northern Crusades in the 13th and 14th century, until we had to surrender it to the Russians in 1809. Now is time to strangle the decadent Finnish state that was born out of the poor Russian administration and restore the rightful order over the Finnish lands once more."
swe_operation_radde_danmark:0 "Operation Rädda Danmark"
swe_operation_radde_danmark_desc:0 "Denmark formed an alliance with the Germans against the syndicalists, a most probably fatal decision for the country: the German eagle has fallen and the torch and cog now rules Europe. As part of the debris of the German sphere, by all accounts it is expected that they will be destroyed by syndicalist forces soon. For Sweden, this situation is highly inconvenient as a syndicalist regime in Denmark could potentially allow a separate syndicalist invasion of our own homeland, and therefore our officers have made a plan: we invade Denmark first and depose the Danish government in favor of a regime friendly to us, thereby creating a buffer zone between us and the syndicalists of mainland Europe."

swe_establish_allmana_sakerhetstjansten:0 "Establish Allmänna Säkerhetstjänsten"
swe_establish_allmana_sakerhetstjansten_desc:0 "With war once again coming to our shores, it has been proposed that we bring our security and intelligence services under one single command, under the General Security Service. We shall put the experience police officer Eric Hallgren in charge of this secret operation to maintain the integrity of our national security."

swe.1.t:0 "Black Monday Arrives in Sweden"
swe.1.d:0 "Two weeks ago, the German stock market imploded and now the waves have come crashing to our shores as first the Stockholmsbörsen followed the fate that played out in Berlin and soon after the rest of the economy followed suit.\nSince the Weltkrieg, Sweden has become highly dependent on German trade, joining its organisation of Mitteleuropa together with Denmark. As such, our trade relations became increasingly one-sided, being aimed at countries in the tariff-free zone: Germany, Denmark and the German puppet states on the Baltic coast, at the cost of other trading partners such as Norway and Great Britain, with whom trading is subject to tariffs, or, in the latter case, even embargoes."
swe.1.a:0 "Herre min skapare!"

swe.2.t:0 "Per Albin Hansson Criticizes Our Crisis Response"
swe.2.d:0 "Per Albin Hansson, leader of the Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Arbetareparti (SAP) and widely considered to be the foremost leader of the opposition, has sharply condemned the Bagge-cabinet’s response to the ongoing economic upheaval, calling their faith in non-intervention dangerous and damaging to Sweden.\nHe once again has called out in favour of his own ‘Folkhemmet’ program that he claims will actually protect those that have lost their jobs to the crisis originating in Germany."
swe.2.a:0 "We are doing what we can!"

swe.3.t:0 "Rising SSV Membership"
swe.3.d:0 "Although the opposition is clearly led by the SAP, two smaller parties are active as well: the Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) which would identify as radical socialists who are strongly in favour of the cause of the so-called Third Internationale and the Bondeförbundet, a social liberal centrist party.\nEspecially the former party is seeing sharp increases in its membership over the years as the social democratic failure to dethrone the perpetual conservative government causes radicalisation amongst its ranks."
swe.3.a:0 "We can only welcome the left fracturing!"

swe.4.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Supports the Bagge Cabinet"
swe.4.d:0 "Long-time prime minister and former leader of the Allmänna Valmansförbundet (AV/General Electoral League) Arvid Lindman has publicly spoken out in favour of the government, declaring his utmost faith in Bagge and rallying voters to support the party he used to lead to the polls.\nLindman has ruled Sweden from 1906 to 1911 and then ruled continuously from 1924 until his retirement in 1934. Many consider his charismatic personality the foremost reason that the conservatives did not lose control to the social democrats like in Denmark. Many doubt whether Bagge will similarly be able to conserve General Electoral League dominance in Swedish politics, and many view the elections of 1936 - the first elections with Bagge as the conservative leader - as influential in determining this."
swe.4.a:0 "Thank you, old friend!"

swe.5.t:0 "SAP Refuses to Rule out Cooperation with Radicals"
swe.5.d:0 "Shocking news as Hansson refuses to rule out the formation of a coalition with the SSV if the outcome would be so that it would be the most democratic to do so.\nThe SSV’s open desire to end the Swedish system as it is in favour of a socialist form of government like in France and Britain (though with Swedish characteristics as outlined in their party program) causes the utmost concern amongst those in the right wing."
swe.5.a:0 "The SAP shows its true colors!"

swe.6.t:0 "A Vote for the SAP Is a Vote for Paris!"
swe.6.d:0 "As a result of the news that the social democrats are open to cooperation with outright radicals, the General Electoral League has started a propaganda war. They openly target SAP voters, claiming the SAP supports the Third Internationale and that any vote for them would directly correlate to a vote for the syndicalist regime in France.\nDespite a sharp SAP rebuke of this rhetoric, and while few actual SAP voters will be swayed by this, it does seem to have successfully played on the emotions of the liberal Folkpartiet voters to the League, who start to consider the SAP a very real danger to their fortunes. They start to see the AV as a much more capable faction to stand up against the SAP’s wicked plans than the Folkpartiet."
swe.6.a:0 "Nothing personal, Andersson..."

swe.7.t:0 "Debate over the Military Expenses"
swe.7.d:0 "As the election approaches, and Gösta Bagge and his minister have to consider the very real possibility of a potential defeat, the government has scheduled a debate to approve at least the Swedish budget of 1936 with the current Riksdag. The Bagge cabinet seeks to maintain the heavy investments in the military to which the social democratic opposition is heavily opposed, claiming that there is no direct threat to Sweden at this time and that the money would be better spent elsewhere to make the lives of Swedes better. The conservatives try to counter to this by arguing that the global tensions are rising and that worrisome events in Norway and Finland could directly threaten Sweden in the future. The government holds a majority in the Riksdag so the budget will definitely pass, but the prevailing argument could bring the party that brings it up closer to electoral victory in the coming elections.\nExperts agree that..."
swe.7.a:0 "...the opposition completely trashed the budget proposal."
swe.7.b:0 "...the conservatives capably defended their budget for the year."
swe.7.c:0 "...the Folkpartiet saved Bagge from a disgrace."

swe.8.t:0 "1936 Swedish Riksdag Elections"
swe.8.d:0 "The election campaign of 1936 has been dominated by underhanded tactics, stirred up emotions and thinly veiled threats. At this point, the only certainty is that whoever will stand victorious after this election will need to cooperate with others to secure a majority. If the Social Democrats stand to be victorious and they would follow through with their threat to cooperate with the SSV, serious trouble is to be expected. If the conservatives win instead, Bagge will secure his position as the carrier of Lindman’s legacy, but doubt will undoubtedly be sowed about the legitimacy of this election by disgruntled socialists."
swe.8.a:0 "The SAP triumphs!"
swe.8.b:0 "The AV remains on top!"

swe.9.t:0 "Cabinet Hansson I"
swe.9.d.start: "For the second time in history, the first time being in 1919, the Swedish social democrats, united in their SAP party have secured a clear electoral victory over our rivals, especially the General Electoral League of Gösta Bagge.\n\n"
swe.9.d.nomajority: "$swe.9.d.start$We do not possess an absolute majority, however, $swe.9.d.finish$"
swe.9.d.majority: "$swe.9.d.start$Despite our widespread support among the population, we have achieved not a parliamentary majority, $swe.9.d.finish$"
swe.9.d.finish: "and will need to form an alliance with one of the other parties in the Riksdag. During the campaign already, we left the door open to work together with the radically socialist SSV, which will likely be the most straightforward path to achieving socialism by democratic means, but it would be a major upset and is likely to bring the Swedish right up in arms. Alternatively, we could form an alliance with the agrarian Bondeförbundet: this would likely require compromise on our vision, but it wouldn't nearly polarise Swedish politics as much.\n\nWhichever option we choose, Lindman's conservative era seems finally behind us and a new Sweden shall rise from it!"
swe.9.a:0 "We will work towards socialism with the SSV!"
swe.9.b:0 "We shall partner with the Bondeförbundet!"

swe.10.t:0 "Cabinet Bagge II"
swe.10.d:0 "Many thought Gösta Bagge incapable of maintaining the legacy of his predecessor Arvid Lindman, but they were proven wrong: once more, the General Electoral League triumphed at the polls, trumping the social democratic SAP.\nDespite our glorious but successful defence of our plurality, we have not been able to secure an outright majority and thus the Riksdag is hung. If we are to form a government we shall have to cooperate with one of the other parties: either we could continue the Bagge I cabinet by continuing our cooperation with the liberal Folkpartiet with whom we can find strong agreement on economic matters, or we could agree to form a coalition with the agrarian Bondeförbundet, which might be a better match on the social aspect of governance."
swe.10.a:0 "An Agrarian-Conservative government looms!"
swe.10.b:0 "We shall continue with the Folkpartiet!"

swe.11.t:0 "The Abolition of the Monarchy"
swe.11.d:0 "One of the conditions of the SSV was that the monarchy be abolished. According to them, this ancient institution was a mere tool of the reactionaries to hold Sweden back from advancing to socialism. The SAP was mostly indifferent to this standpoint and its outright republican wing was small, but eventually the desire to rule with fellow socialists won out.\nSince the instruments of government, which serves as the Swedish constitution, can be amended by a simple majority in the Riksdag, now commanded by the SAP-SSV coalition, this was easily enacted, despite unanimous opposition and the harsh condemnation by the Gösta Bagge and his General Electoral League, now an opposition party."
swe.11.a:0 "I hope this will be worth the trouble..."

swe.12.t:0 "A Cold Morning in [GetMonth]..."
swe.12.d:0 "It was still early in the morning when suddenly a group of men knocked violently on the door of Per Albin Hansson's house at Ålstensgatan 40. When the door opened, a coarse military voice spoke up: 'Per Albin Hansson, by orders of the new government you are under arrest for treason!'\n\nAll over the city of Stockholm, brigades of soldiers have occupied strategic spots and government buildings: from the many bridges of the city, to the Riksdaghuset, the Swedish parliament, uniformed Swedish soldiers are present. Just after dawn, army general Oscar Nygren read a statement on the national radio, declaring the 'treasonous crypto-syndicalist government with the intent of destroying Sweden's legacy forever' of Hansson neutralized and that a temporary junta directed by an organisation called the 'Arméns Fosterlandsvänner' will soon restore the old order 'from before the fraudulous elections of this year'. He cited several misdeeds that prompted the military to intervene like this, but it becomes increasingly clear that it was the sudden abolishment of the monarchy that convinced the last conservative military leaders that Hansson does not only seek to put them out of a job by reducing spending on the military, but that he also seeks to make Sweden a puppet of Paris."
swe.12.a:0 "Sweden shall be cleansed of crypto-syndicalism!"
swe.12.b:0 "The Coup is Defeated, the Republic is Secure!"

swe.13.t:0 "Worker's Militias Form!"
swe.13.d:0 "A year ago, he would have been ignored and swiftly arrested by a government, but today, Anton Nilson and his several companions' message would be heard. Armed with weapons, this group of socialists seized a broadcasting station of Radiotjänst in the city of Malmö, to send out a message of resistance against the reactionary menace that is attacking the government and undoing the steps that are to be set.\nIt worked, despite the militant socialist voice behind it, Swedes from across the country formed militias: from liberals to social democrats to hardcore syndicalists, this violation of the democratic process would not be accepted gladly. Before long, worker's militias in stockholm, filled with labourers with a brave desire to save their country from military tyranny! Soon the sides stood eye to eye at the first strategic points. The mob was scantly armed, and what happened next would change Sweden forever:"
swe.13.a:0 "Machine guns were whipped out and the street was cleared in minutes!"
swe.13.b:0 "The soldiers, common men themselves, joined them against their rogue superiors!"

swe.14.t:0 "Successful Coup d'Etat"
swe.14.d:0 "The rest of the day was a blur characterized by scant information; more worker's militias rose, but the soldiers carrying out the coup remained dedicated and lacking arms, they were quickly mowed down by machine gun fire if they refused to disperse. As the sun began setting, Stockholm and most other major cities had fallen to military control. Malmö, the breeding nest of the loyalist resistance and home of the revolutionary radio message, had surrendered to government forces by dawn the next morning.\nIn Stockholm, Oscar Nygren as head of the junta officially appointed his cabinet among those backing his coup. With the Arméns Fosterlandsvänner divided into three competing factions, deciding which officer shall be the new prime minister will be key in determining the next steps that are to be taken."
swe.14.a:0 "Carl August Ehrensvärd of the reformist faction!"
swe.14.b:0 "Helge Jung, the balanced candidate!"
swe.14.c:0 "Archibald Douglas of the extremist faction!"

swe.15.t:0 "Failed Coup d'Etat"
swe.15.d:0 "The rest of the day was a blur characterized by scant information; more and more militias rose, and more and more soldiers defected to the worker's cause, leaving their rogue companies outgunned. This naturally culminated in a frenzied charge on the riksdaghuset in the late afternoon, which was occupied by the most loyal putschists, and by the end of the day, the militias controlled all major cities in Sweden.\nAs the dust began to settle, two things became clear: first, the social democratic government had completely incinerated during the coup. This became especially clear when a totalist-aligned militia found the corpse of Per Albin Hansson, murdered by the military, they clarified. He was immediately declared a martyr of the Swedish revolution. Secondly, a syndicalist republic based on the models of Britain and France has been born. While it was true that many militiamen had been liberals and social democrats, the death of Hansson convinced many of them that a firmer hand was needed, and those dissenting that policy fell prey to the first totalist tactics in hunting counterrevolutionaries, with the silent acceptance of the other socialists."
swe.15.a:0 "A new Sweden has been born today!"

swe.16.t:0 "Totalist Reign of Terror"
swe.16.d:0 "The dust had been settling after the failed attempt of the forces of reaction to chain the people in the fields in the following week. Still, the early days of the socialist republic were tumultuous and bloody. The totalist paramilitary organisations that had been making moderates disappear in the late stages of the violence, shifted their scope from crypto-reactionaries, skilfully posing as loyal comrades to subvert the worker's momentum, to the open reactionaries that had been ruling Sweden for decades, years, centuries and that had never been pretending otherwise than to control the working class. In the other factions, voices started to arise to put a stop to these practices, often executed with vicious tactics, although it was clear that in the anarchist atmosphere following the establishment of the worker's state, not everyone could be saved."
swe.16.a:0 "Let them have their fun, it can only safeguard the revolution!"
swe.16.b:0 "Restrain them for as much as we can, we are not barbarians!"

swe.17.t:0 "Swedish Refugees"
swe.17.d:0 "Sweden has fallen prey to the socialist scourge that has been plaguing Europe for a while. Following the successful establishment of a worker's state, local totalists have taken their chance to take their revenge on Swedish capitalists, politicians, priests and other men of the old Swedish regime. As a result, many try to flee Sweden and unlike many of the other nations falling prey to this scourge, they don't have a colonial empire to rely on. As such they are seeking refuge in [Root.GetNameDef]. Several groups have already arrived at our border, but should we accept them?"
swe.17.a:0 "Welcome in [Root.GetNameDef]!"
swe.17.b:0 "Turn away, Swedish scum!"

swe.18.t:0 "Militant Socialists"
swe.18.d:0 "You are travelling by motorcarriage in the countryside of Stockholm when it comes to a sudden halt. The road has been blocked by a fallen tree, and the driver explains that you will have to make a slight detour on an isolated dirt road."
swe.18.a:0 "Very well, but this had better not delay us!"

swe.19.t:0 "Militant Socialists"
swe.19.d:0 "After less than half a league on the small path, your motorcarriage gets stuck in the mud and you are ambushed and surrounded by militant socialists! They send your driver on his way, explaining that their interest lies with you alone. You try to call for your guards, but they merely laugh at this - it is they too who want your blood."
swe.19.a:0 "Y-you're not socialists!"

swe.20.t:0 "Douglas Declares Himself Riksledare"
swe.20.d:0 "Following the unfortunate discovery of the death of our dear leader Oscar Nygren at the hands of militant socialists, Archibald Douglas has taken over his status as head of the junta. Douglas immediately merged the post with his post of prime minister he already held under the name of 'Riksledare' and declared over national radio that 'considering the apparent strength of the socialist menace, the restoration of the old government would henceforth be suspended for an undefined time and that the military regime would stay in control for the foreseeable future."
swe.20.a:0 "The socialists are vicious, but our Riksledare is strong!"

swe.21.t:0 "Military Tribunals"
swe.21.d:0 "After order was swiftly restored, the first military tribunals were formed. While a large part of the judges in the normal judicial system had been appointed by conservative ministers of justice, the junta was wary that those given a permanent mandate by the social democratic ministers of justice in the early 1920s would deliver their fair share of embarrassing acquittals to traitors, some of whom were affiliated with said party.\nTo prevent this from happening, this new instance will convict everyone the military needs out of the way regarding the coup, from socialists who had been resisting the coup in the streets to those that were part of the Hansson government."
swe.21.a:0 "First trial..."

swe.22.t:0 "Hansson v. Sweden"
swe.22.d:0 "The first man to be brought before the tribunals was now-former prime minister Per Albin Hansson. This traitor had been seeking to subvert Sweden and misused the trust of the people to take their freedom away by establishing a syndicalist tyranny. Luckily his wicked plans have been disrupted by the brave and selfless actions of the military. Unluckily for Hansson, the prosecutor is part of Douglas's faction and not forgiving: he demands the death penalty for this syndicalist, but according to Swedish law the death penalty may only be imposed in times of war. As such, the main argument between prosecution and Hansson's defence is whether the coup could identify as times of war, which would decide whether Hansson could be executed or would merely be imprisoned for life for his crimes. After that, the tribunal brings in the verdict which likely sets the tone for the other trials to come..."
swe.22.a:0 "...that Hansson be imprisoned for life."
swe.22.b:0 "...that Hansson be executed."

swe.23.t:0 "Restoration of the Monarchy?"
swe.23.d:0 "The original intentions of the military men who seized control of the apparatus of state was to restore the government as it was before that faithful day of 20 September 1936, with perhaps a few extra safeguards to make sure that these tragic syndicalist infiltrations would never happen again. As such, it would be necessary to prevent the social democrats from partaking in future elections and the king, who has been painfully passive in the whole crisis, will not be brought back. Instead we shall put the grandson of the king on the throne, the duke of Västerbotten, who is known to harbour strong anti-syndicalist opinions, is an officer and who will therefore keep the nation safe.\nHowever, some in the military government instead consider that bringing back the monarchy and civilian government will only endanger their interests, and they would rather announce an extension of the military control of the country."
swe.23.a:0 "Announce the imminent restoration of 'democracy'."
swe.23.b:0 "Extend the suspension of the instruments of state!"

swe.24.t:0 "Gustaf VI Adolf Swears the Royal Oath"
swe.24.d:0 "As per the junta's promise, the monarchy has been restored today. In a grand ceremony, prince Gustaf Adolf, grandson of former king Gustaf V, has sworn the royal oath and has officially become Sweden's king as is his birthright, shortly after the law in restoring the monarchy entered into power after being affirmed by the Riksdag."
swe.24.a:0 "Long live the king!"

swe.25.t:0 "The king Appoints the New Government"
swe.25.d:0 "After the Swedish crown landed solidly on the new king's head, the transition from junta back to democracy swiftly continued. Shortly after his oath, the junta announced their resignation and a civilian government was to be established once more: with the SAP forced underground and their seats vacant, the General Electoral League enjoyed a comfortable majority among the remaining seats in the Riksdag, and thus the king asked Gösta Bagge to form a government once more. One of the last acts of the junta was entrenching the royal reserve powers that got shafted after the crisis, but it remains to be seen whether the new king will actually use them."
swe.25.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.26.t:0 "The Establishment of the Ehrensvärd Cabinet"
swe.26.d:0 "The reality was that Oscar Nygren was just a mediocre authoritative figure. Slowly, control of the factionalized junta was slipping away and taking advantage of this, general Carl August Ehrensvärd was there to help in governing the country. More and more responsibilities of Nygren were shifted to Ehrensvärd and his supporters, to the point where Nygren was little more than a puppet of the clique of Ehrensvärd. His retirement in favour of Ehrensvärd was a matter of time by then. Being much more talented for rulership, Ehrensvärd immediately shuffled the cabinet to be filled with loyalists, and thus the moderate arm of the AFV would be in control for the foreseeable future."
swe.26.a:0 "A natural process"

swe.27.t:0 "The Jung Junta"
swe.27.d:0 "Oscar Nygren isn't the most authoritative figure and scheming in his factionalized junta was the order of the day. As a result, Nygren's control was slipping away and general Helge Jung, who was present when the plans for the coup formed and the one to nominate Nygren as a weak candidate all three factions could rally behind. Needless to say, as Nygren, in part because of the tiresome scheming in his government, let it be known he intended to resign from his post, it was Jung who had gathered the support needed to take over in his wake, and quickly filled the brief power vacuum caused by it. Soon, those opposing Jung found themselves replaced by the fresh ruler and the ruling junta became synanimous with the so-called 'Jung junta'."
swe.27.a:0 "Helge Jung is the true saviour we deserve!" 

swe.28.t:0 "The Formation of the Douglas Regime"
swe.28.d:0 "Oscar Nygren was perhaps not that skilled in ruling, and he realised himself this. Few would fail to notice the slow expansion of the Douglas clique within the junta, but Nygren indeed did not. Or at the very least, he must have underestimated the threat they posed, because it still came as a surprise when pro-Douglas soldiers entered his office, pressed a proposal for a law into his hands with the message to pass it: the junta would be finished, and the Riksdag would be extended with the seats which had been left vacant after the coup by the SSV and SAP. All these seats would be transferred to a new party called the 'Svea Rike Nationella Samlingsparti', led by Douglas. Once the formalities were over, the Riksdag affirmed with a law to amend the instruments of government the office of Riksledare which would be capable of overruling the Riksdag by decree and granted the office to Archibald Douglas, giving him unlimited power within Sweden."
swe.28.a:0 "A civil government is back... But it is... Different..."

swe.29.t:0 "The Dissolution of the Landsorganisationen"
swe.29.d:0 "It was no secret that the trade unions of Sweden, unified in the so-called Landsorganisationen, as well as those unified in the Central Worker's Organisation of Sweden (SAC), supported the old treacherous government. In the aftermath of the coup, many of these trade unions tried to organise strikes against the new government, with limited success. After some time, the junta did what was necessary and dissolved all trade unions."
swe.29.a:0 "Good riddance"

swe.30.t:0 "The Reestablishment of Trade Unions"
swe.30.d:0 "The ideologues of the SRNS considered it vital to reestablish worker's interest organisations for the nation to regain the working class' support. Several factions have arrived at the office of the Riksledare: the first one supports the establishment of a Guild System that is unique to Sweden. This would make all labourers members of guilds that will be established for their craft that can be freely joined if one switches carreers or starts at the labour market. Companies will be banned from contracting people who are not part of a guild and the guild will represent its members in labour negotiations.\nThe second proposal is to allow the trade unions to organise again, albeit under strict government control.\nLastly, some argue that trade unions in whatever form or terminology are harmful to Swedish society and should remain banned as it is."
swe.30.a:0 "The Guild system faction prevails"
swe.30.b:0 "Trade Unions are reestablished under strict government control"
swe.30.c:0 "Trade Unions remain banned"

swe.31.t:0 "The Guild System"
swe.31.d:0 "A year into the new 'Guild' system, we can conclude that it is rather successful. Even though critical eyes conclude that is just yet another way of the SRNS to control society, after all the implementation of 'Gilleledares' - Guild Leaders loyal to the regime - means that it allows the regime to exclude dissidents from society by excluding them from their craftmanship and even the labour market as a whole, the reality that suddenly all Swedish worker's are represented in labour negotiations has made barbarous practices like Statare untenable and the regime, previously considered one belonging to the rich, much more popular among the lower classes of Sweden."
swe.31.a:0 "Rich and poor Swedes stand together in the quest for the greater!"

swe.32.t:0 "The State of the Trade Unions"
swe.32.d:0 "Half a year after trade unions were, under significant government surveillance, allowed to function again, the results have sadly been disappointing. Instead of taking their new allegiance seriously, we immediately saw a revival of syndicalism in its ranks and the government was soon forced to act. Troublemakers were soon evicted from the trade unions and government control took the momentum once again, but as a result few workers consider the trade unions as they are a legitimate body defending their interests. To many, they are just organisations under the thumb of the bourgeoise government and the very bosses they are supposed to oppose."
swe.32.a:0 "Cut our losses, ban them again."
swe.32.b:0 "Make membership mandatory to force participation!"

swe.33.t:0 "The Trade Unions"
swe.33.d:0 "After the government decreed that everyone partake in the unions, they were suddenly packed with uninterested workers who reluctantly attended the union meetings. The legitimacy remained low, but with a lot of government pushing participation started to rise and after some time, some concessions convinced some more workers that there was merit in this system. As a result the controlled union system has become somewhat of a self-sustaining organism but it is probably still not what the Riksledare and the ideologues intended it to be."
swe.33.a:0 "Tell the press it's a great success!"

swe.34.t:0 "A Riksledare and an Archbishop"
swe.34.d:0 "The SRNS recognized the moral authority held over the Swedish people by the church of Sweden. In fact, gaining the support of this body was one reason the small Swedish Jewish community had seen protection by the Riksledare from the less racially inclusive elements in his cabinet, as the archbishop was known to oppose antisemitism. Because of these reasons, it was no surprise that Archibald Douglas and the archbishop of Uppsala, Erling Eidem met regularly. Douglas was willing to pass substantial laws favouring the church of Sweden, for instance to restore the legislation that rendered it illegal to leave the church as well as cracking down on sinful activities. In return however, the church would have to actively remove progressive anti-government clergy and openly support the Riksledare. Based on his conversation with the Riksledare, Erling called a synod to discuss the issue."
swe.34.a:0 "Let the synod run its course..."
swe.34.b:0 "Help the decision-making by visiting anti-government clergy."

swe.35.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.35.d:0 "The synod of the church of Sweden has concluded and the priests have agreed that no earthly government the likes of that of the SRNS can have unequivocal support, and that in this light the democracy that existed before suffered from a lesser moral deficit. In addition, they agreed one can't bargain for God's support with legislation in support of His values. People need to open their hearts for it themselves after all. The clear outcome of the synod is a rejection of the SRNS doctrine.\nThe Riksledare ignited in outrage by the news and by the end of the day the Church of Sweden was no longer the state church, nor could many priests of the organisation, including Archbishop Erling, enjoy their freedom anymore."
swe.35.a:0 "B-but wrath is a sin?"

swe.36.t:0 "The Synod of Uppsala"
swe.36.d:0 "Strangely, many progressive clergymen did not arrive at the synod or suddenly changed their minds on the matter. However, the synod went ahead as planned: The clergymen that were actually present agreed that the execution of God's will was worth some concessions and that SRNS government was already carrying out God's will by persecuting heathenly syndicalists and protecting Sweden from this scourge.\nThe Riksledare was delighted by the news and from that point on the church of Sweden became a integral if at times somewhat reluctant part of the SRNS propaganda machine, with a topdown enforcement of orthodox government support and heavy government support for the church in return."
swe.36.a:0 "We shall hold our end of the bargain too!"

swe.37.t:0 "Transition to a Civil Government"
swe.37.d:0 "As time passed on, the military form of government became increasingly tenuous to maintain. It was therefore no surprise that at some point, the Riksledare declared all seats in the Riksdag to be part of his own party the 'Svea Rikes Nationella Samlingsparti'. Once this was done, power was transferred to the Riksdag, which immediately moved to permanently affirm Douglas's status as Riksledare in a law that allowed the holder of said office to bypass the Riksdag itself in the Swedish instruments of government. At this point, the Riksledare possessed almost unlimited power and Sweden as it was known before the coup would be forever gone."
swe.37.a:0 "It's different but still the same."

swe.38.t:0 "The New Instruments of Government"
swe.38.d:0 "The Riksdag has passed a new set of instruments of government which serves as the Swedish constitution. The new document explicitly excludes parties subscribing to marxist or syndicalist thought, and entrenches the right of the Swedish monarch to exercise its reserve powers, as well as other minor amendments that heavily favour the conservative government."
swe.38.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.39.t:0 "Sweden Wants to Join the Internationale"
swe.39.d:0 "The Swedish revolutionary government has petitioned us with their desire to join the struggle for the world revolution. Shall we crush the bourgeoisie together with the Swedish worker?"
swe.39.a:0 "Definitely!"
swe.39.b:0 "We shall never stand in battle with those sockpuppets!"

swe.40.t:0 "France Accepts!"
swe.40.d:0 "We have received word from the communard government that we are welcome in the struggle against the forces of reaction and the dark forces of financial capitalism. Together we shall crush the bourgeoisie!"
swe.40.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.41.t:0 "France Rejects Us!"
swe.41.d:0 "The communards have let us know that we are not welcome on the battlefield against the forces of reaction. Apparently they consider us just another front that will not be held."
swe.41.a:0 "Curse those snail-eaters!"

swe.42.t:0 "A Statue for a True Revolutionary"
swe.42.d:0 "While Per Albin Hansson was not without his faults - he was very strongly in favour of the rather hopeless strategy of working within the bourgeoise government to amend it - the man has shown himself to be a true hero of the revolution. After all, it was clear that he was most definitely intending to bring about the establishment of this republic as evidenced by the abdication of the king he pushed. Sadly, this great hero of the revolution perished at the hands of the military at the opening stages of a coup. If it wasn't for the heroic actions of a SP militia, we may never have been able to find back his body.\nOf course, such a glorious revolutionary needs to be remembered, and for that reason we have commissioned a large statue in the city where Hansson grew up: Malmö."
swe.42.a:0 "A great statue for a great revolutionary!"

swe.43.t:0 "First Day of the Revolution"
swe.43.d:0 "Exactly one year ago, the vicious capitalist tyranny was washed away with the blood of the proletariat. Since it is important for Sweden's people to remember that Sweden's freedom does not come free, we have decided to declare the day of the revolution a national holiday. On this day, all workers will have a day off and the state will organise activities for the next generation while the adults have a chance to socialise!"
swe.43.a:0 "This will become a yearly event!"

swe.44.t:0 "Day of the Revolution"
swe.44.d:0 "Once more, it is the birthday of the revolution. The state has commissioned activities for the children of Sweden in honour of the revolution while the adults, who are let off work, use their free day with the children gone to socialise!"
swe.44.a:0 "Leve vår Revolution!"

swe.45.t:0 "Norway in the Internationale"
swe.45.d:0 "Many within the government considered the neutrality that has been de-facto maintained by Sweden since 1815 holy. However, Norway has fallen to the syndicalist menace, and, not only that: they joined the Third International of the French Commune and the Union of Britain. In addition, aggressive rhetoric towards 'the liberation of the evil capitalist tyranny of Sweden' is almost a daily occurrence among some in the rogue state that has spawned in the place of our wester neighbour.\n\nWith these threats and keeping in mind that their formal ascension to the Third International alliance may mean that the Norwegians will let loose their Anglo-French attack dogs on us, many consider it wise to abandon our neutrality, dear to us it may be, as the syndicalists won't have problems violating it and it would make us only vulnerable to attack, in favour of an alliance with the Germans, our avid trade partners and known rival to the Third International."
swe.45.a:0 "We should join the Reichspakt!"
swe.45.b:0 "Our Neutrality will hold, even in face of these new challenges!"

 swe.46.t: "Sweden Petitions to Join the Reichspakt"
 swe.46.d.NOR: "With heavy concerns, Sweden has been watching as their Norwegian neighbour collapsed to Syndicalism and started openly affiliating with the regimes in Paris and London. While the Swedish government values Sweden's tradition of neutrality, this was too great a threat to ignore and now they petition to stand with us as a combined vanguard against the red menace. And with their steel reserves at our disposal."
 swe.46.d.other: "The government of Sweden has been eyeing the recent developments in Europe with concern. While the Swedish nation has long prided itself on a tradition of neutrality, the growing threat of revolutionary socialists and the resurgent Russian state have ultimately pushed Stockholm to reconsider its isolationist stance. In a bid to secure its future, Sweden has petitioned to enter the Reichspakt - bringing their steel reserves with them."
 swe.46.a: "Welcome to the fight, Swedish Brethren!"
 swe.46.b: "They would be a mere burden to protect."

swe.47.t:0 "Germany Accepted Our Proposal"
swe.47.d:0 "We have received word from our embassy in Berlin that the imperial governments has approved of our petition to join their alliance as a vanguard against syndicalism!"
swe.47.a:0 "We stand together against anarchy!"

swe.48.t:0 "Germany Rejects Us"
swe.48.d:0 "The imperial government sees nothing in our proposal to stand together in alliance. It seems that we are on our own."
swe.48.a:0 "Neutrality it is, after all..."

swe.49.t:0 "The General Electoral League Changes Its Name"
swe.49.d:0 "Since their defeat in 1936, the fate of the conservative General Electoral League has been one of misfortune. The party has been seeing much of its support defecting to the Social Democrats of Hansson, and those who supported the League in opposition to the Social Democrats are going back to the Folkpartiet if the polls are to be believed.\nIn an attempt to rebrand the party that is now the bastion of right-wing opposition and to reverse its fortunes once more, party leadership has elected to change the partyname into the National Organisation of the Right (Högerns Riksorganisation). Whether this tactic will be successful in attracting more voters once again, remains to be seen."
swe.49.a:0 "Interesting..."

swe.50.t:0 "The King Intends to Send a Letter"
swe.50.d:0 "His royal majesty has let us know his intention to send a letter to the German Kaiser. It seems he wants to thank the Germans for taking care of the syndicalist pest that is haunting Europe. Such a letter could potentially become embarrassing and damage our neutrality, so some in the government would like us to stop his majesty from sending this letter."
swe.50.a:0 "Strengthening our bonds with others can never hurt!"
swe.50.b:0 "We can't jeopardise our neutrality like this, forbid it!"

swe.51.t:0 "A Letter from the King of Sweden"
swe.51.d:0 "We have received a letter from King Gustaf V of Sweden. He thanks us for taking care of the syndicalist pest in France and congratulates us with the victories achieved so far. A most kind gesture from the Swedes to express their support for our cause like this."
swe.51.a:0 "Instruct our ambassador to thank them for this!"
swe.51.b:0 "A nice gesture indeed!"

swe.52.t:0 "German Thanks!"
swe.52.d:0 "The German ambassador has passed on his nation's thanks to one of our cabinet's ministers for the kind letter from our king supporting their cause against the syndicalists. They say it was a most kind gesture and that they consider us too to be good friends."
swe.52.a:0 "It was nice wasn't it? His majesty's own idea even!"
swe.52.b:0 "But we forb... No matter, splendid!"

swe.53.t:0 "Folkpartiet Rises in the Polls"
swe.53.d:0 "For a while, it seemed like disenfranchising the social democrats had made conservative control over Sweden unopposed. It seems however, that in their absence, the liberal Folkpartiet has risen to prominence, with much of the old social democratic support base now putting their weight behind them, knowing that while they do not espouse the same economic ideals as them, they do support bringing the SAP back into the legality and restoring freedom like it used to be before the conservatives made their control virtually impenetrable using the law."
swe.53.a:0 "A new challenger arises..."

swe.54.t:0 "The Folkpartiet Controls the Opposition"
swe.54.d:0 "For an extended amount of time, the conservatives have been the most influential party in Sweden, but this seems to be over. First they lost the government to the social democrats, and as they continued to fail to decisively recapture it, their performance at the polls has been declining. Last elections it has finally happened: with the conservatives once again winning the least amount of seats since the establishment of the modern Riksdag, they have lost their standing as the second-largest party and dropped to the third place in favour of the liberals, who will now take over the leadership over the Swedish opposition."
swe.54.a:0 "A dark day for Swedish conservatism"

swe.55.t:0 "[GetYear] Swedish General Elections"
swe.55.d:0 "The campaigning season has run its course again and the Swedish people have gone to the polls to elect the government they consider to be the best for Sweden. All that is left is for the ballots to be counted before we can declare the winner..."
swe.55.a:0 "The Social Democrats triumph!"
swe.55.b:0 "The Conservatives stand victorious!"
swe.55.c:0 "The Liberals will rule!"

swe.56.t:0 "Social Democratic Government formation"
swe.56.d:0 "Once again, the social democrats have been victorious in the elections, and it is their right to form a Swedish government. The press eagerly wonders what kind of government will rule Sweden the coming years..."
swe.56.a:0 "A unity cabinet of all centrist parties"
swe.56.b:0 "An agrarian-social democratic coalition"
swe.56.c:0 "A one-party cabinet leveraging the acquired majority"

swe.57.t:0 "Conservative Government Formation"
swe.57.d:0 "The elections have been a clear victory for the conservatives, and as such it is only right that we will be the ones to form the Swedish government. The press is eagerly awaiting an announcement from the party as it will be instrumental in determining what kind of government will rule Sweden in the coming years."
swe.57.a:0 "We shall rule with the agrarians!"
swe.57.b:0 "The liberal Folkpartiet is our natural ally!"

swe.58.t:0 "Liberal Government Formation"
swe.58.d:0 "The liberals have decisively won the Riksdag in the elections, and as such it falls to the Folkpartiet to form the Swedish government. Many wonder what kind of government the liberals will cook up, and the press is eagerly awaiting the announcement."
swe.58.a:0 "A true liberal coalition with the Bondeförbundet"
swe.58.b:0 "A coalition with the conservatives, but under liberal leadership!"

swe.59.t:0 "Constitutional Amendments"
swe.59.d:0 "Many within both the liberal and agrarian parties had been agitated when the conservatives changed the instruments of government to disenfranchise a large part of the nation. Now that the Folkpartiet rules Sweden - ironically arguably due to the forceful exclusion of the social democrats - it is therefore no surprise that they roll back these changes. In addition, they have entrenched the instruments, so that henceforth a two-third majority will be required to amend the instruments."
swe.59.a:0 "Democratic integrity has been restored!"

swe.60.t:0 "Sweden Implements Tariffs"
swe.60.d:0 "The Swedes have implemented tariffs against us, despite the fact that they are part of the Mitteleuropa Free-Trade Zone and thus in principle banned from implementing such measures. Many economists feel we should retaliate against this measure, lest the integrity of Mitteleuropa be harmed and other members get ideas!"
swe.60.a:0 "We shall retaliate!"
swe.60.b:0 "We have bigger fish to fry right now!"

swe.61.t:0 "Germany Retaliates!"
swe.61.d:0 "The Germans have not taken lightly to our attempt to bend the rules in our favour: they have instituted their own sanctions against us and due to their economic weight, this hurts our companies - mainly specialised in raw resources - a lot more than our sanctions hit them. New lay-offs are being announced as Swedish companies now need to pay tariffs to reach the German and Danish markets."
swe.61.a:0 "Blast!"

swe.62.t:0 "The Crisis Situation Improves"
swe.62.d:0 "The unemployment level has fallen below 24%. As a result, the Swedish economy is starting to show its first signs of recovery as more people work and they start spending their salaries again. Although the worst is over, we remain far from pre-crisis levels."
swe.62.a:0 "It's a start!"

swe.63.t:0 "The Crisis Situation Improves Further"
swe.63.d:0 "The unemployment level has now fallen below 20%. With more and more people starting to find work again, the Swedish economy is recovering at an ever-increasing rate. Despite this, the effects of the crisis can still be felt clearly and full recovery will still require a fair amount of effort."
swe.63.a:0 "Prosperity shall return with time!"

swe.64.t:0 "The Crisis Situation Improves Even More"
swe.64.d:0 "The unemployment level has now fallen below 16%. Many people who were previously stuck at home are finding jobs again and the situation looks a lot better already compared to earlier. While the effects of the crisis can still be felt, a full recovery seems closer than ever!"
swe.64.a:0 "Sweden will survive this!"

swe.65.t:0 "The Crisis Is Over!"
swe.65.d:0 "With the unemployment level below 12%, the Swedish economy is running once more at the speed it once used to before the disturbing events of black monday. We successfully resolved the economic downturn!"
swe.65.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.67.t:0 "The Crisis Commission Reports!"
swe.67.d:0 "The Crisis Commission that was set up in the 1936 Crisis Act has delivered the reports of last year's balance. They have been left on your desk."
swe.67.a:0 "Ah, splendid! I will have a look!"

swe.68.t:0 "Sovereign Debt Crisis"
swe.68.d:0 "Terrible! It was known that the commission had been unorthodox with the usage of loans, but noone had expected that it would be this bad! The enormous debt the commission has incurred in their attempts to counter Black Monday's effects can't be accounted for with the rest of the Swedish budget and we are forced to declare that our debts can't be repaid, bankrupcy in effect! Domestic and foreign investors alike will lose their money and surely not be happy!"
swe.68.a:0 "Oh no!"

swe.69.t:0 "Sovereign Debt Crisis in Sweden"
swe.69.d:0 "Sweden had long been considered a safe haven for investments, but not quite so anymore: this morning they have officially declared bankrupcy, apparently as a result of Black Monday: they are no longer capable of fulfilling their debts. Many [Root.GetAdjective] investors who invested in Swedish bonds have now lost their money."
swe.69.a:0 "Blast!"

swe.70.t:0 "Unemployment Decreases"
swe.70.d:0 "As a result of our policy of devaluing the Swedish Krona, it has become quite cheap to buy the raw resources we export. As a result, our exports skyrocketed and this is having a positive effect on our domestic employment!"
swe.70.a:0 "Hurrah!"

swe.71.t:0 "Hyperinflation"
swe.71.d:0 "Our decision to keep devaluing the Swedish Krona after it started to have an effect on our economy may have been a mistake. The inflation now started snowballing and everything is showing that the domestic price level will double twice this year. As everyone's monetary possessions are melting away before the sun, we have basically no choice but to abandon our sovereign currency and start again with a new one."
swe.71.a:0 "The Krona is dead! Long live the Krona!"

swe.73.t:0 "The Death of King Gustaf"
swe.73.d:0 "Our dearest sovereign, king Gustaf V of Sweden, has died today in the Stockholm palace as a result of flu complications. A century ago, the crown prince, Gustaf VI Adolf, would be crowned king of Sweden; like his father however, his majesty has opted not to be crowned and instead to take only the Konungaförsäkran - the regal assurance."
swe.73.a:0 "The king is dead, long live the king!"

swe.74.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf V"
swe.74.d:0 "The former royal sovereign of Sweden, Gustaf Bernadotte, has passed away in the estate Bernadotte bought some 40 kilometers outside Stockholm after the loss of the Swedish throne. Still hoping for a restoration, his son Gustaf Adolf Bernadotte has taken over as the pretender to the Swedish throne."
swe.74.a:0 "Rest in peace..."

swe.75.t:0 "The Death of Gustaf V"
swe.75.d:0 "The former royal sovereign of Sweden, Gustaf Bernadotte, has passed away in the estate the Bernadotte family bought some 40 kilometers outside Stockholm after the loss of the Swedish throne. His Majesty king Gustaf VI Adolf, who had been restored to the throne after his grandfather lost it, has personally assured that he will be buried along with the other former kings of Sweden since Gustavus Adolphus in the Riddarholmskyrkan."
swe.75.a:0 "Rest in peace..."

swe.76.t:0 "The Propagandaspeakers"
swe.76.d:0 "The communal government of the capital - probably with encouragement of certain elements in our cabinet - has approved a motion to install loudspeakers with music and state propaganda in all public buildings encouraging the workers to do their part for the Swedish Revolution as well as advocating ideological purity. Many think this would be a great testing environment to see the effectiveness of such a doctrine of total propaganda, but some fear that the effects will be limited and that the enthousiastic approach of the communal government will only be counterproductive."
swe.76.a:0 "Who would we be to meddle with the local government?"
swe.76.b:0 "Tell them to cancel it, this won't work!"

swe.77.t:0 "Mediocre Effect of the Propagandaspeakers"
swe.77.d:0 "The extensive use of propagandaspeakers we let the communal government implement has had a mediocre effect it seems: while indeed the membership of totalist unions has increased marginally more than in the rest of the country, there have been several complaints that the loud noise of the loudspeakers keeps them out of their concentration (at work) or sleep (at night). Several loudspeakers have even been damaged and required replacement. It seems the experiment is moderately unsuccessful."
swe.77.a:0 "Extend the usage to all of Sweden!"
swe.77.b:0 "Have the experiment be abandoned!"

swe.78.t:0 "The Fate of the Press"
swe.78.d:0 "Following the establishment of the worker's state, an imminent problem was the press: most newspapers and as well as the national radio service remained active in the aftermath of the Swedish revolution and some of them even had the gall to criticise the new order.\n\nWhile all factions among the revolutionaries agreed that blatant bourgeoise propagandastations like the capitalist Svenska Dagbladet can obviously not remain active as it is, they all proposed a different approach. The Flyggists of the SP proposed their plan of 'Likriktning': all media in Sweden ought to be put under strict government surveillance to ensure the revolution remains well-protected from reactionary lies. The syndicalists of the SAC had a different proposition: all media should be reorganized in a single newswriters union under the general Swedish Landsorganisationen, which will ensure the content will be objective and not spread falsehoods to the detriment of the socialist order. Finally, the radical socialists of the SSV propose cautiousness; while they agree that obviously reactionary newsmedia should be dissolved, they want us to leave the rest of the media alone."
swe.78.a:0 "Likriktning: protect the revolution!"
swe.78.b:0 "Reorganisation: seize the means of information!"
swe.78.c:0 "Cautiousness: save the freedom of press!"

swe.79.t:0 "The Establishment of the Stasä"
swe.79.d:0 "Many non-totalist socialists were rather dissatisfied with the actions of the SP's paramilitary organisations against reactionaries. By their accounts, the hunt has cost the lives of many who could not even be considered a threat to the revolutionary order, and made it a lot harder to convince Swedes that did not yet subscribe to the revolution that this was really the best way forward.\n\nAs a result of this, they proposed to establish a new agency that would receive the sole authority to protect Sweden from counterrevolutionary activity and with official government support. Somewhat to their surprise, the totalists jumped right on this idea and propose far-reaching powers for this new 'Sekretariatet för Statssäkerhet' - it seems like they are hoping to gain control over it."
swe.79.a:0 "Let the hunt restart with new resources!"

swe.81.d:0 "The nefarious symbol of reaction, Gustaf Bernadotte, who acted as the figurehead for his German reactionary-capitalist puppetmasters' exploitation of Sweden for almost 30 years, has died in exile, while still hoping to some day mend the chains that once shackled the people of Sweden. His son has taken over the mantle as pretender for the 'Swedish throne' and as figurehead for the Swedish exiles."
swe.81.a:0 "Good riddance!"

swe.82.t:0 "The Centralisation of Power"
swe.82.d:0 "After having been installed into power by the worker's mandate, the Totalisterna and now their general secretary immediately went to work. Some of the first actions of Nils Flyg as the general secretary was to relieve those senior officials that were hostile to the totalist thought and the doctrine of total commitments to the revolution from their duty and replacing them with loyal members of the movement."
swe.82.a:0 "You don't belong there if you aren't totally committed!"

swe.83.t:0 "Pacifying the Unions"
swe.83.d:0 "It didn't take long until the apparatus of state had been cleansed of anti-totalism. With the different positions around the government under totalist control, the main political threat to continued unity of Sweden were the unions, that could technically enforce a congress to force a change of government. To prevent crypto-reactionary revisionism from taking root again, the General Secretary announced that union leaders were to be subjected to political tests lest they lead their herd to the wrong end of the spectrum."
swe.83.a:0 "Swedes may not be deceived by revisionists!"

swe.84.t:0 "The Start of Something Greater!"
swe.84.d:0 "After a few months, the hold of the totalist movement over Swedish society had become near total.\nGeneral Secretary Nils Flyg often held speeches to rouse the Swedish people in favour of the national-revolutionary doctrine with his perfected talents for speeching. One day, after such a speech, the 'Folkets Dagblad' which the Swedish leader once redacted started with a front article lauding the great leadership of the General Secretary so far and his wisdom.\n\nThe Article has caught the attention of the leader and his cabinet, who start to consider that letting the media focus on the qualities of Nils Flyg could be politically beneficial."
swe.84.a:0 "Start to work on this 'Cult of Personality'!"
swe.84.b:0 "Our focus should be the revolution, not comrade Flyg!"

swe.85.t:0 "The Creation of a Cult"
swe.85.d:0 "During the last year, news has exacerbated the role of Nils Flyg in the revolution. Comrade Flyg's role in the revolution has become legendary, and it is widely portrayed that it was his decision to defend the revolution from liberals that made it possible to happen. In addition, schools have been instructed to portray Nils Flyg as a true Swedish hero and an example for all to follow and official photographs of the General Secretary adorn the carriages of public transport!"
swe.85.a:0 "Excellent, Comrade Flyg is an example to us all!"

swe.86.t:0 "The Writer's Union Wants to Write a Biography"
swe.86.d:0 "The Writer's Union has let us know that they intend to write a biography about our great leader Nils Flyg, from childhood to today. This is of course a great way to further the popular knowledge about their general secretary, but some discord started to boil over whether we - and comrade Nils in particular - should hold a tight leash on what is being written. Some in the cabinet want us to subject this endeavour under close government control, while others believe that in the knowledge that the Writer's Union is known to be politically correct means it wouldn't become a character assassination, and that if it would turn out in such a way we can always censor it before it is released."
swe.86.a:0 "We need to make sure the truth is written down!"
swe.86.b:0 "Let the writer's write as they would."

swe.87.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.87.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, like how the general secretary already made remarks about the inherent unfairness of the contemporary feudal-capitalist system that held Sweden in chains at the tender age of 8 years old and how bourgeoise spies that infiltrated the workers movement constantly tried to hinder Flyg's career, recognizing that he would liberate the Swedish worker if they couldn't control him, which eventually of course, they couldn't. The book ends in describing the instrumental role Flyg played in the Swedish revolution, which could be considered a departure from the government stance that had been held since the revolution, where the ultimate sacrifice of Per Albin Hansson was accredited as the main event that sowed the seeds for a revolutionary regime."
swe.87.a:0 "An excellent literary artwork!"
swe.87.b:0 "Lies upon lies, cancel the biography!"

swe.88.t:0 "The Life of Nils Flyg"
swe.88.d:0 "The Writer's Union has finished their biography of Nils Flyg: the book describes the life of comrade Flyg in great detail, telling the story from his birth to his rise to power in the present day. In general the book is positive about Flyg's endeavours, praising for instance his capacity to self-educate in his early youth allowing him to rise among the many workers in the socialist movement at the beginning of the 20th century, but also strikes a critical tone at times: for instance the implication is made that the strength of the socialist movement was hurt a lot by Flyg's decision to move forward with his own party, which contributed to the fracturing of Swedish socialism. Indeed the book also puts some weight in criticising the absence of Flyg during the most uncertain hours of the revolution while totalist paramilitaries roamed the streets."
swe.88.a:0 "Criticism is healthy, go ahead!"
swe.88.b:0 "Oh no, I think not!"

swe.89.t:0 "The General Secretary Visits a Workplace"
swe.89.d:0 "In order to bring the touch of the regime closer to the people, the General Secretary, a former industrial worker himself, has arrived to visit a factory where Sweden's industrial heart beats the strongest. One of the civil servants of the secretariat of economics has in the meanwhile drafted a plan to increase the efficiency of factories such as these. One of the junior members of the General Secretary's entourage proposes disposing of the civil servant and bringing the idea as comrade Flyg's own in the ending speech he will give, which would show the wisdom of comrade Flyg to the Swedish people."
swe.89.a:0 "A cunning plan! Make the arrangements."

swe.90.d:0 "Tragedy: our General Secretary, Nils Flyg, has been hit by a heart attack today. Fortunately, he survived the calamity, but after being rushed to the doctor the doctor explains that Flyg will never be the same again. He will likely suffer from short breath henceforth which will likely become progressively worse in the future. And there is a risk that he will suffer a second heart attack. The doctor recommends that comrade Flyg takes as much rest as possible."
swe.90.a:0 "Rest? The General Secretary of Sweden never rests!"

swe.91.t:0 "The General Secretary's Ill Health Starts to Become Public!"
swe.91.d:0 "Since comrade Flyg's heart attack, his short-breathedness has progressively become worse as the doctor predicted. As a result, the General Secretary eventually caved and dialed down his public appearances, which in turn is feeding the rumour among the Swedish populace that something is wrong with their General Secretary - with the news about the heart attack carefully being censored.\n\nBecause of our... zealous investment in the cult of personality of Nils Flyg, words are spreading that this is the proof that the government is deceiving the Swedish populace, trying to portray Flyg as a God when he is really just a man that can also fall ill."
swe.91.a:0 "Hold a Rally to prove that Flyg is just fine!"
swe.91.b:0 "Time to switch to damage control!"

swe.92.t:0 "The Rally Is Unsuccessful"
swe.92.d:0 "The rally we organised to prove the health of our eternal general secretary has not been able to end the doubts; in fact, the situation has worsened as a result because while the speech started relatively smooth, it was easy to observe that the General Secretary was not well from the very beginning and as the speech continued a clear fatigue overcame the General Secretary. It made one journalist even feel bold enough to want to write that Nils Flyg's life has been shortened by three months by this event. Naturally, this counterrevolutionary scum has swiftly been taken care of."
swe.92.a:0 "I tell you, he is in good health!"

swe.93.t:0 "A Hotel Room has been Requisitioned"
swe.93.d:0 "As the condition of our General Secretary slowly deteriorates, he has become unable to make the daily travel from villa Tomtebo, the home of Flyg he acquired in 1924. As it is important for his duties as General Secretary that he is able to convene with congress and other officials of the Swedish state, he has requisitioned a hotel room close to the Stockholm castle, where the assembly convenes and he has his office. Reportedly he is distressed by the fact that he will for the time being live in a hotel room."
swe.93.a:0 "It's for the good of the country..."

swe.94.t:0 "The Motion Linderot"
swe.94.d:0 "Since the totalist seizure of power, the Swedish congress had become a mere rubberstamping institution for General Secretary Flyg, with little in the way of upsets. The congress was filled with committed totalists, except for about ~30% of the delegates, who were not removed to retain the pretense of democracy and had rallied around Nils Flyg's former associate Karl Kilbom and basically unsuccessfully vote against almost every proposal, with every proposal getting the exact same amount of seats in favour and against since the consolidation of SP control.\n\nThis morning, this atmosphere of political apathy was suddenly crushed: Sven Linderot, the leader of a faction within the SP in favour of greater internationalism and a lesser (European) nationalist doctrine with the party, suddenly pitched a motion to establish a 'Politiska Byrån' - political bureau - to take over the General Secretary's duties on behalf of congress as long as his condition will not allow him to properly exercise said duties. This was swiftly condemned by Flyg loyalists, headed by Arvid Olsson, yet the Kilbommare, witnessing this split in their nemesis, capitalised and supported the motion. For the first time since 1937, a motion against the will of the Flyggists passed."
swe.94.a:0 "How dare they!"

swe.95.t:0 "The Appointment of the 'Politiska Byrån'"
swe.95.d:0 "Following the passing of the Linderot Motion through congress, congress had to elect the delegates that would become members of the bureau. Unsurprisingly, Linderot had pitched his own list with himself as the chairman of the bureau and loyalists for the rest, which would essentially give him all power Flyg previously possessed. The Kilbommare did not cave to that however, and moved to present their own alternative list of syndicalist democracy proponents headed by Kilbom himself. Olsson and the Flyggists were wary of being left the opposition incapable of stopping the motion again, and resolved it would be better to help one of the two sides to the majority they require to take the bureau - hopefully the side that would be the least capable of removing Flyg from power."
swe.95.a:0 "Support Linderot - at least he is Totalist!"
swe.95.b:0 "Support Kilbom - at least he didn't betray us!"

swe.96.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Orders Flyg Be Moved Home!"
swe.96.d:0 "With his hold over the Political Bureau of his own creation, Sven Linderot was given de-facto in control over the country. The first act of the bureau is to have Flyg be moved back to Tomtebo. According to the bureau, this is so the General Secretary can rest, but most consider the real underlying reason is to render Flyg politically pacified. After all, without his hotelroom Flyg can't easily get to the halls of power in a good condition and thus it will be significantly easier for Linderot and his companions to control the country and Flyg's omnipresent supporters. Unsurprisingly, the General Secretary resisted with all the power he had, but the police officers 'to protect him' were relentless."
swe.96.a:0 "It is for your own good, Nisse!"

swe.97.t:0 "The Political Bureau Gathers for the Next Move!"
swe.97.d:0 "With the General Secretary out of the picture, the control of the Political Bureau is unlimited. Now a choice lies before Linderot: either he could announce Flyg's resignation now while Flyg is incapable to react and in poor health, or he could hold his horses, ruling the country for the foreseeable future, taking the gamble that Flyg will not recover and possibly go after him in the future for what he just did."
swe.97.a:0 "Announce Flyg's resignation!"
swe.97.b:0 "Let us remain just where we are!"

swe.98.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.98.d:0 "With Nils Flyg 'resigned' Linderot's own ambitions have been exposed. The Flyggists and mixed totalists, now firmly aware of what Linderot is trying to do and that Flyg's resignation wasn't his own decision, pitch comrade Flyg and exclaim that they will never support 'the rat' Sven Linderot for General Secretary, saying they'll put in even Kilbom into that office before Linderot. The Kilbommare opposition meanwhile, seek to do exactly that, but also among them it is clear, that by the guise of 'better the devil you know' and the consideration that Flyg is in poor shape, they are inclined to support Flyg. Coming in as a dark horse candidate for the position of General Secratary is Sven Olov Lindholm, a hardline Charter Toalist and supporter of General Secretary Flyg; who has often come into conflict with more mainstream Syndicalists. While some decry him as a pseudo reactionary, he appears to have a significant bout of sway considering Kilbom's craven moderatism and Flyg's poor health. It seems Linderot has overplayed his hand; he has lost the race before it even began and knowing that either side won't be soft on him for his attempted powergrab, his supporters are bailing out left and right. The question is however, which side will cave to the other first?"
swe.98.a:0 "Flyg is reelected in the third round!"
swe.98.c:0 "Lindholm is elected in the third round!"
swe.98.b:0 "Kilbom is elected in the third round!"

swe.99.t:0 "The Purge of the Linderot Faction!"
swe.99.d:0 "With the removal of Flyg, the Political Bureau was automatically dissolved too as it was a kind of regency for the General Secretary. As such, Linderot and his loyalists had been planning to invoke the articles included in their motion to reestablish the political bureau. However, these plans were cut short when the authorities arrived at Linderot's doorstep and arrested him on the suspicion of reactionary sympathies. In a show trial the same day he was with hastily convicted to thirty years of hard labour and sent on his way to a prison complex in the north of Sweden specifically designated for enemies of the regime. He was not seen again in Stockholm.\n\nSeveral other staunch Linderot loyalists have been put into custody too. The power of Linderot and his internationalist totalists has been broken."
swe.99.a:0 "Good Riddance!"

swe.100.t:0 "Politiska Byrån Dissolves Congress!"
swe.100.d:0 "With Kilbom in control of the bureau that takes care of the duties of the most important office of the country, the bureau has decreed that the political barriers imposed by General Secretary Flyg earlier are to be removed and had the congress dissolve. In a month's time all delegates of the congress shall face a free election, with no political barriers holding you back from partaking. It is obvious that the Kilbommare are out on getting a congress hostile to totalist rule to commence a recall vote on General Secretary Flyg, to then restore democracy."
swe.100.a:0 "Time to start campaigning!"

swe.101.t:0 "Recall Vote on Nils Flyg"
swe.101.d:0 "After vigorous campaigning, free elections have been held and changed the composition of congress. As such, we are now pitching a recall vote to try and remove Nils Flyg from power, which will let us in turn elect a new General Secretary and safeguard revolutionary democracy in Sweden."
swe.101.a:0 "The recall vote passes, Nils Flyg is removed!"
swe.101.b:0 "The recall vote fails, Flyg remains in power."

swe.102.t:0 "Electing a General Secretary"
swe.102.d:0 "The syndicalist-democratically aligned congress removed Nils Flyg from his office as General Secretary, which probably helps him more than it hurts him, considering his fragile health. Congress must now elect a new General Secretary however. Most agree that Karl Kilbom - now the saviour of Swedish revolutionary democracy - should become the new General Secretary on behalf of the SSV. The SAC did nominate Frans Severin however and members from both parties have formed an alliance in the hopes of abolishing the office of General Secretary altogether, considering that it only leads to tyranny."
swe.102.a:0 "Kilbom is elected General Secretary."
swe.102.b:0 "Severin is elected General Secretary."

His wife was rushed to his hotelroom as fast as possible but when she arrived it had already been too late - the General Secretary passed away alone. While she lost her husband, Sweden lost its leader, and chaos overtakes congress as a vacuum in power has suddenly spawned out of this as a result. This vacuum was soon filled however: with Linderot and Kilbom having been outplayed earlier and the SP faction reunited, it seems clear who shall become the new chairman of the SP."

Flyg had spent his last months grumbling and raging against Sven Linderot, who as chairman of a 'Political Bureau' had him moved home 'to rest' as a result of which he could do nothing against the chairman's de-facto exercise of power that technically belonged to him. For better or for worse though, he was at home at his Tomtebo villa; had he remained in the hotel room that he had been assigned at first, he might well have died alone, without his wife and closest supporters by his side.\n\nCongress was swift in declaring Sven Linderot the second Chairman of Sweden, who had discretely been consolidating his power while ruling in Flyg's place.

Namely, he has been observed being aggressive, rude, sarcastic and almost abusive to his subordinates. Of course the totalitarian regime left by Douglas has many more 'radical' supporters, who wish to see the state transformed from a mere military junta into a more solidly legionarist state; this contingency is headed by former veterinarian Birger Furugård, who heads a radical arm of the SRNS's paramilitary. Others wish to follow arch-Conservative, traditionalist, corporatist, and Maurrassian figure Elmo Lindholm, a renowned philosipher and Latin scholar who heads the nationalist Sveriges Nationalella Förbund party.

### Swedish Socialism elections ###

swe_syncon.1.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee Assembly - Governmental Status"
swe_syncon.1.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has been assembled for its first session. Tensions are high as all three parties are vying for power in this new, strange political climate. Membership numbers for all parties are exploding, although Sveriges Socialdemokratiska Vänsterparti (SSV) is the largest one by far.\n\nFrom his podium, Karl Kilbom of the SSV advocates that in the new Sweden, we (the state) look after everyone who needs it, without prying into the affairs of common citizenry. Nils Flyg of Socialistiska partiet (SP) claims that citizenry police needs to be established, to 'safeguard the revolution' while Albert Jensen of Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation (SAC) claims that every commune should look after their own." 
swe_syncon.1.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."
swe_syncon.1.b:0 "Kilbom wins this round."
swe_syncon.1.c:0 "Nils Flyg controls the debate."

swe_syncon.2.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee Assembly - Economic System"
swe_syncon.2.d:0 "The Revolutionary Committee has assembled for a second time. The initial belief that seizing power in Sweden would unify the left has now completely waned. Reforming the economy of Sweden is the topic of the day, and speaking sharply for the SSV is Anna Johansson Visborg, claiming that strong unions and government influence will secure worker's rights.\n\nThe SP representative, Sven Linderot, claims that all workers should be gathered into a single, large union, and a the focus should be on massive state funded projects. Finally, Gustav Sjöström of the Syndicalists proposes the idea of commune based economy, where every region should strive to be self-sufficient."
swe_syncon.2.a:0 "Sjöström has the right of it."
swe_syncon.2.b:0 "Visborg wins this round."
swe_syncon.2.c:0 "Linderot controls the debate."

swe_syncon.3.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee Assembly - Military Matters"
swe_syncon.3.d:0 "For a third time the Revolutionary Committee holds session. With the current military disloyal to the red cause, the various leaders are discussing radical army reforms. Zeth Höglund of the SSV wants to reintegrate the Swedish army through education of staff and soldiers, where soldiers council's should elect officers out of their own ranks.\n\nGustav Johansson from SP claims that a strong army needs a strong central command, and that a National School for politically indoctrinated officers must be the backbone of our new army. The SAC representative, Nisse Lätt, believes armies should be trained and used for local, defensive deployment and only summoned elsewhere for extreme situations."
swe_syncon.3.a:0 "Lätt has the right of it."
swe_syncon.3.b:0 "Höglund wins this round."
swe_syncon.3.c:0 "Johansson controls the debate."

swe_syncon.4.t:0 "The Revolutionary Committee Assembly - Societal Doctrine"
swe_syncon.4.d:0 "Our fourth session has been assembled. Outside the doors, Sweden lies in chaos, but inside we are assured we can sort it out. Our new society must build upon equality, a strong union and compassion for your fellow man, or so claims Östen Unden of SSV.\n\nHilding Hagberg from SP believes that we must put faith in a strong man to lead us all into an era where Sweden isn't just a strong nation, it's a great nation, rivaled by none and feared by all! The most passionate of all speakers however is the SAC representative Elise Ottosen Jensen, who envisions her dream of a society free of oppression, where one cares and shares with your local community."
swe_syncon.4.a:0 "Jensen has the right of it."
swe_syncon.4.b:0 "Undén wins this round."
swe_syncon.4.c:0 "Hagberg controls the debate."

swe_syncon.5.t:0 "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly" #Totalist
swe_syncon.5.d:0 "The Totalists have achieved a total victory in the revolutionary assemblies. With a majority of our latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that our strategy of talking the loudest during the debates has been successful. With a new Totalist regime ready to rule Sweden with an iron fist, it is clear who will become the General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly: Nils Svante Flyg, undisputed leader of the totalist movement shall rise to power and stand at the top while Sweden shall rise in this new age!"
swe_syncon.5.a:0 "Nils Flyg will raise Sweden to the sky."

swe_syncon.6.t:0 "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly" #RadicalSocialist
swe_syncon.6.d:0 "The Radical Socialists have won in the revolutionary assemblies. With a majority of our latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that our strategy of talking the loudest during the debates has been successful. With a new radical socialist regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a single, last decisions to make.\n\nWho should sit there? Many thought of Kilbom, a former sailor and journalist, as the obvious choice, but the famous and incredibly popular poet and writer Karin Boye has soared in the party ranks as of late."
swe_syncon.6.a:0 "Karl Kilbom is what Sweden needs."
swe_syncon.6.b:0 "And the day is you, Karin Boye."
 
swe_syncon.7.t:0 "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly" #Syndicalist
swe_syncon.7.d:0 "The Syndicalists have won in the revolutionary assemblies. With a majority of our latest proposals having been approved, it turns out that our strategy of talking the loudest during the debates has been successful. With a new syndicalist regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a single, last decisions to make.\n\nWho should sit there? The last draw has come down in between Elise Ottesen-Jensen, a former sex-educator and agitator and wife of Albert Jensen, another major figure in the syndicalist movement, and her adversary Frans Severin, another influential member of the SAC congress."
swe_syncon.7.a:0 "Elise Ottosen-Jensen is our choice."
swe_syncon.7.b:0 "Frans Severin is our first pick."
 
 #Draw:
 swe_syncon.8.t: "The General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly"
 swe_syncon.8.d.socialist_totalist: "The battle has been hard fought in the revolutionary assemblies. The Totalists and the Radical Socialists have both gained and held ground. With a new regime ready to climb to the seat of ultimate power as General Secretary of the First Swedish Worker's Assembly we have a difficult decisions to make. Who should sit there?\n\nEither the Totalist option of Nils Flyg, a former editor in chief and undisputed leader of the totalist movement, will shoulder the responsibility or perhaps Kilbom, the former sailor and journalist is a better choice? Either way, one side is doomed to feel left out, and Sweden might suffer from this split."

### Flavor Event ###

swe_flavor.1.t:0 "Karin Boye Releases För Lite."
swe_flavor.1.d:0 "Karin Boye, a prominent author, poet and female rights activist coloured by socialism has just released her latest piece. It's a novel called För Lite (Too Little or For Little) and centres around the themes of working to achieve your dreams or make your ends meet, and your responsibility to yourself as a person and to your family and friends. Boye is very popular and her new novel is a success."
swe_flavor.1.a:0 "I shall have to read it sometime."

swe_flavor.2.t:0 "Greta Garbo Stars in Camille."
swe_flavor.2.d:0 "Greta Garbo stars in the American produced movie Camille, a romantic drama. Greta Garbo is one of the biggest names in the movie industry, both in Sweden and in the world. The movie is rather harmless and holds a high quality production but some of the more conservative elements of our society are most upset... Her clothes are a bit revealing! They are calling for a censorship. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.2.a:0 "That outfit is too revealing! Censor it!"
swe_flavor.2.b:0 "It seems most entertaining. Send me a ticket!"

swe_flavor.3.t:0 "Five Year Commemoration of Ådalen"
swe_flavor.3.d:0 "In May 1931 a large march of strikers marched towards barracks for blacklegs who were working at local factories. The police had called in the military for support and before the day was over, the riots had ended in five strikers being killed by military fire. Ever since then yearly marches are held in memory of the dead workers among socialists, although conservatives claim that the workers were armed and attacked them first. The strikes of this year are unusually large. What should we do?"
swe_flavor.3.a:0 "Let them. They'll tire eventually."
swe_flavor.3.b:0 "Wasn't once enough? Send in the military!"

swe_flavor.4.t:0 "Final Sentence of the Sala-gang"
swe_flavor.4.d:0 "In the summer of last year a gang led by a name called Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman (a name he added himself, presumably because it is an anagram for Manhunter) was arrested for a murder. Soon the investigations reached nationwide front news as it turned out that the gang was not only guilty of murders dating all the way back to 1931, but also because it was ran more or less like an occult group and went under the nickname 'The Magic circle''.\n\nThe leader and the conspirators were sentenced in court the other day, most of them to life in prison but the leader was considered so mentally ill that he was sentenced to closed psychiatric care. Many people are outraged, and would have wanted to see Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman put away for good!"
swe_flavor.4.a:0 "We must respect the court's decision. Closed care it is."
swe_flavor.4.b:0 "Arrange for this monster to be relocated to a prison."

swe_flavor.5.t:0 "Manhunter on the Loose!"
swe_flavor.5.d:0 "Two years ago, Sigvard Nilsson-Thurneman was sentenced to closed psychiatric care but our politicians overruled the decisions and put him in prison. In prison his mental state reportedly worsened, and just after Christmas last year he broke out and murdered a taxi driver and stole his car. The police lacks any good leads and fear he may have gone underground or even left the country..."
swe_flavor.5.a:0 "What have I done?!"

swe_flavor.6.t:0 "Major Hotel Strike!"
swe_flavor.6.d:0 "After failed negotiations with the unions a major hotel strike has caused a hotel lockout in Sweden. From Stockholm to Göteborg to Malmö you won't find a single hotel which is properly staffed. Striking down at the protestors violently could disperse them... or set off a backlash, while negotiation with them could make the red parties grow. We could just ignore them, but that might hurt our economy, at least for a while."
swe_flavor.6.a:0 "Let's replay Ådalen, send in the military!"
swe_flavor.6.b:0 "Let's negotiate with them."
swe_flavor.6.c:0 "Ignore them. Surely it will stop?"

swe_flavor.7.t:0 "City Massacre"
swe_flavor.7.d:0 "Our brave soldiers nobly defended the government directives when the strikers, reds and other rabble started throwing bottles and rocks. The turmoil and riots lasted for the entire day and over a dozen workers have been killed before the protestors were fully cleared. For some reason a couple of journalists managed to leak pictures of bleeding civilians in the streets of Göteborg, and now Sweden is in shock!"
swe_flavor.7.a:0 "If they had only stayed home..."

swe_flavor.8.t:0 "The Hotel Strike Ends"
swe_flavor.8.d:0 "For several months the strike has been going on, hurting our economy and our prestige, but eventually we tired them out. The strikes have ended and things are back to normal... For now."
swe_flavor.8.a:0 "Thank Goodness!"

swe_flavor.9.t:0 "Funeral of Gösta Ekman"
swe_flavor.9.d:0 "The legend of Gösta Ekman, Sweden's most popular actor and theatre-director, passed away at age 47 after a period of sickness. In the last eleven years, Ekman was part of no less than twenty three productions. Following his funeral train in the streets of Stockholm, over 100 000 (!) people, roughly a fifth of the city, watched the coffin pass and mourned the end of a Swedish legend."
swe_flavor.9.a:0 "We all mourn today."

swe_flavor.10.t:0 "Astrid Kindstrand on the Radio"
swe_flavor.10.d:0 "A few days ago, Astrid Kindstrand read the news on Sweden's Radio, the national radio channel, the first woman to do so in Swedish history. In the following days, hundreds of angry phonecalls and letters reached the state and various newspapers across the country to complain that a woman is allowed to read state news."
swe_flavor.10.a:0 "Don't they have anything else to be upset about?"

swe_flavor.11.t:0 "Landstormens Lilla Lotta"
swe_flavor.11.d:0 "A new Swedish comedy movie has hit the theatres and reached a surprising amount of popularity. It plays a bit with the traditional story of Romeo and Julia but also throws things of order upside down, such as making the bank director a private when he joins the army and the groundskeeper a commander. Everyone fools around and no one takes their military training seriously while falling in love with one of the pretty women of the Lotta-corps."
swe_flavor.11.a:0 "Oh ho ho! I love me some jolly movies!"
swe_flavor.11.b:0 "How dare they mock the Swedish military like this?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.12.t:0 "Garbo Skrattar - Ninotchka!"
swe_flavor.12.d:0 "Garbo laughs - That is how the movie is marketed all across the world, as the Swedish, beautiful mega-star Greta Garbo does her first attempt at a comedy movie. The movie centres around Garbo in the role of Ninotchka, an ice-cold syndicalist who finds love and abandons her political ideas to move to a capitalist society. Even though it is tounge-in-cheek, and makes fun of the capitalist society too, it is clear that it mocks all forms of syndicalism."
swe_flavor.12.a:0 "She is so beautiful! Get me a ticket!"
swe_flavor.12.b:0 "How dare they mock the glorious Swedish revolution?! Censor it!"

swe_flavor.13.t:0 "Kallocain Released"
swe_flavor.13.d:0 "Kallocain is a novel written by the ever busy Karin Boye. It takes place in a dystopian, fictive nation where critizising the state is strictly illegal and the state controls every single part of your life. It reflects on men and women, on class issues and the conflicts that arise from these issues. It is, ultimately, a depressing read. It takes brutal stabs at any totalitarian regimes, left or right."
swe_flavor.13.a:0 "A fascinating and disturbing read!"
swe_flavor.13.b:0 "How dare she mock the strong, glorious state? Censor it!"

swe_flavor.14.t:0 "Death of Karin Boye"
swe_flavor.14.d:0 "Karin Boye was found lifeless on a hill north of Alingsås after she had, seemingly intentionally, overdosed on sleeping pills. The poet and author was known for her emotional instability, in particular over the last few months. Even more so perhaps since one of the women she loved, Anita Nathorst, was dying of cancer. Her sexuality was a public secret, and the pressure of it all might have been too much."
swe_flavor.14.a:0 "Visst gör det ont när knopparna brister..."

swe_flavor.15.t:0 "IKEA Founded"
swe_flavor.15.d:0 "The other day a seventeen-year-old lad named Ingvar Kamprad founded a small company for selling everything from pencils and fishing tools, to stockings and belts. It is run from his parent's private farm as a mail order company and appearently he will personally bike out to your home and deliver the goods to your front door."
swe_flavor.15.a:0 "Seems like an ambitious young man."

swe_flavor.16.t:0 "New Malmö Theatre Opens"
swe_flavor.16.d:0 "The recently opened Malmö City Theatre is one of the largest theatres in Europe, and offers and impressive display indeed. For the opening night it will show the classic of 'A midsummer night's dream', the Shakespear classic."
swe_flavor.16.a:0 "Get me a ticket!"

swe_flavor.17.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Passes Away"
swe_flavor.17.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many as a father of the Nation. The former admiral reigned as prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge.\n\nIt is said that Bagge rarely took any decisions without asking for advice from the senior Lindman, but no longer. A public funeral will be held and attended by the King and other people of fine birth."
swe_flavor.17.a:0 "A great statesman is gone" 
 
swe_flavor.18.t:0 "Arvid Lindman Is Dead"
swe_flavor.18.d:0 "Arvid Lindman was a conservative politician, a member of the navy staff and considered among many to be a tyrant who did everything he could to kill democracy and socialism in it's cradle. He reigned as a prime minister in between 1906 to 1911 and then again, more or less as a permanent head of government, from 1924 until 1934, when he stepped down in favour of the younger Gösta Bagge.\n\nWhen our revolutionary government proclaimed Sweden to be a republic, he was among the first to flee abroad and he died, alone and unwanted, in a flat in Berlin."
swe_flavor.18.a:0 "A great tyrant is gone"

swe_flavor.19.t:0 "Valkyriorna Formed"
swe_flavor.19.d:0 "With war coming to the shores of Sweden, the stunt-pilot Elsa Andersson, known for her daring parachuting in the twenties, has requested to form a women's only air brigade. The project has adopted the name 'Valkyriorna', after the winged women of ancient norse mythology who oversaw which warriors would be slain on the battlefield. Women have gathered in droves to sign up, wanting the chance to fight for Sweden, but the idea is not undisputed. Many feel that women in the army is not fitting with a modern civilised nation."
swe_flavor.19.a:0 "Everyone who wants to fight for Sweden is welcome!"
swe_flavor.19.b:0 "Ladies! We need you on the homefront..."

### Decisions ###
SWE_fix_black_monday_category:0 "Response to Black Monday"
SWE_fix_black_monday_category_desc:0 "The Swedish economy is tightly connected to the German one, and as such, the economic downturn in Berlin soon found its way to the purses of the average Swede. As such, the prime minister has appointed a Crisis Commission under the minister of finance to prevent Sweden from ailing away under the effects. With unemployment rising and tax returns shrinking this will surely be a daunting task, however.\n\nFree Budget: [swedishBudgetAmount] kronor.\nInflation: [?swe_var_inflation|%-0].\nUnemployment: [?swe_var_unemployment|%R0].\nRelated debt: [swedishDebtAmount] kronor."
SWE_drop_gold_standard:0 "Drop the Gold Standard"
SWE_drop_gold_standard_desc:0 "The Swedish national bank, the Riksbank, is held to convert Swedish Kronor into gold at standardised value by law. We can suspend the standard however, as per the instruments of government in times of financial ruin, which will make Swedish goods easier to sell internationally, but also cause inflation."
SWE_print_extra_money:0 "Print extra money"
SWE_print_extra_money_desc:0 "We can order the Riksbank to print us extra money to spend. However, this may cause the value of the Kronor to drop."
SWE_take_a_loan:0 "Borrow 2 million Kronor"
SWE_take_a_loan_desc:0 "We can take a loan of 2 million Kronor to add to our budget, but this can not be done indefinitely."
SWE_repay_a_loan:0 "Repay 2 million Kronor"
SWE_repay_a_loan_desc:0 "We can repay 2 million Kronor from our budget, so we won't have to pay interest over it anymore."
SWE_cut_funding_on_military:0 "Cut Military Funding"
SWE_cut_funding_on_military_desc:0 "We can save quite a bit of money by cutting the funding of the military. The world is becoming ever less stable however, so such a decision should not be taken lightly. In addition, the Swedish conservatives are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_raise_taxes:0 "Raise Taxes"
SWE_raise_taxes_desc:0 "We can bring in some extra money to spend on countering Black Monday by raising some extra taxes. This may stifle the market even further however, and the Swedish liberals are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_cut_welfare:0 "Cut Welfare Funding"
SWE_cut_welfare_desc:0 "We can save quite a bit of money by cutting on welfare expenditure. Such a move may deny those that have been hit the hardest by the crisis a much-needed lifeline, and, unsurprisingly, the Swedish Social Democrats are heavily opposed to such a measure."
SWE_public_work_program:0 "Start a Public Works Program"
SWE_public_work_program_desc:0 "The most straightforward way to combat unemployment is to kickstart large public works projects the unemployed can participate in. They can then use the money they earn with this to take care of their families. As an added bonus, the money they spend will enter the economy and help it recover."
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports:0 "Subsidize Raw Resource Export"
SWE_subsidize_resource_exports_desc:0 "A large part of the Swedish economy relies on the export of raw resources such as iron ore and tungsten. By subsidizing these exports, we will find our fair amount of foreign currency flowing our way, which will aid our recovery significantly."
SWE_nationalize_company:0 "Nationalize a Major Company"
SWE_nationalize_company_desc:0 "Fact is that the goals of major companies are often aimed at making the most profit rather than providing as many people as possible with a living. To that end it might be worthwhile to nationalize one of these major companies and redirect it towards that goal. This will not be cheap, however."
SWE_implement_tariffs:0 "Implement Tariffs"
SWE_implement_tariffs_desc:0 "We can try protecting our own economy by implementing tariffs against the cheap goods that enter Sweden while bringing in some money as well. We are part of Mitteleuropa however, which is a free-trade area; as such, this is technically a violation of our international obligations."
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission:0 "Wrap up the Crisis Commission"
SWE_wrap_up_crisis_commission_desc:0 "The Crisis Commission was established in the 1936 Crisis Act to help Sweden combat the effects of Black Monday. Once the crisis is over and everything has been properly dealt with, we can wrap up the commission."
SWE_repay_leftovers:0 "Repay [?swe_var_debt|1] million Kronor"
SWE_repay_leftovers_desc:0 "We can repay the rest of our debt from our budget, so we won't have to pay interest over it anymore."
SWE_counter_inflation:0 "Increase the Riksbank Interest"
SWE_counter_inflation_desc:0 "Banks in Sweden take loans from the Riksbank. By increasing the interest over these loans, we can influence the money supply and lower our inflation once."

SWE_geopolitical_actions:0 "Geopolitical Actions"
swe_join_reichspakt:0 "Join the Reichspakt"
swe_join_reichspakt_desc:0 "With the dangers of syndicalism ever encroaching towards Swedish borders, it would be prudent to look to likeminded powers. The Kaiserreich is the champion of the status quo, and a fellow Germanic nation withstanding the tides of Latin anarchy. Let us stand together in battle!"
swe_join_internationale:0 "Join the Third Internationale"
swe_join_internationale_desc:0 "The dangers to the young revolutionary republic are many, with the fat kaiser viciously looking to end the worker's freedom in its neighbouring countries in its cradle. We should stand together with our Comrades in France and Britain against this menace!"
swe_leave_reichspakt:0 "Leave the Reichspakt"
swe_leave_reichspakt_desc:0 "We have come to the conclusion that the political climate that was in place when Sweden decided to enter into an alliance with the Germans is no more, and that the alliance is now hampering our goals more than it is aiding it."
swe_leave_internationale:0 "Leave the Third Internationale"
swe_leave_internationale_desc:0 "In the recent past, the Internationale has unfortunately been moving into a direction that is incompatible with the Swedish doctrine of socialism of European origin that is spreading around the world. The sad truth is that the main worker's alliance is moving towards a dead end and Sweden will not follow it into the ravine."
swe_seize_aland:0 "Invade Åland"
swe_seize_aland_desc:0 "We tried to secure Åland at the end of the Weltkrieg when Finland and Russia's fate were still not clear. German pressure eventually forced us to retreat, despite our righteous mandate with over 80% of the archipelago's population wishing to join Sweden, and resolved the dispute in their Finnish puppet state's favour. An opportunity might arise to bring the islands into their rightful homeland once more, be that for strategic or nationalist reasons."
swe_subjugate_neighbours: "Subjugate [FROM.GetName]"
swe_subjugate_norway_desc: "The Norwegians have enjoyed their independence long enough. It is time for Sweden to reclaim its birthright as the country that dominates and shapes the Scandinavian geopolitical scene and a Norway that doesn't bend the knee to Stockholm does not constitute a proper part of the new Nordic order."
swe_subjugate_finland_desc: "Finland has historically been under Swedish dominion ever since the Northern Crusades in the 13th and 14th century, until we had to surrender it to the Russians in 1809. Now is time to strangle the decadent Finnish state that was born out of the poor Russian administration and restore the rightful order over the Finnish lands once more."
swe_operation_radde_danmark:0 "Operation Rädda Danmark"
swe_operation_radde_danmark_desc:0 "Denmark formed an alliance with the Germans against the syndicalists, a most probably fatal decision for the country: the German eagle has fallen and the torch and cog now rules Europe. As part of the debris of the German sphere, by all accounts it is expected that they will be destroyed by syndicalist forces soon. For Sweden, this situation is highly inconvenient as a syndicalist regime in Denmark could potentially allow a separate syndicalist invasion of our own homeland, and therefore our officers have made a plan: we invade Denmark first and depose the Danish government in favor of a regime friendly to us, thereby creating a buffer zone between us and the syndicalists of mainland Europe."

swe_establish_allmana_sakerhetstjansten:0 "Establish Allmänna Säkerhetstjänsten"
swe_establish_allmana_sakerhetstjansten_desc:0 "With war once again coming to our shores, it has been proposed that we bring our security and intelligence services under one single command, under the General Security Service. We shall put the experience police officer Eric Hallgren in charge of this secret operation to maintain the integrity of our national security."


getFlygsRefuge_Norway:0 "the large villa he had been assigned in Norway"
getFlygsRefuge_France:0 "a beautiful house in France"
getFlygsRefuge_Britain:0 "a moisty farmstead in Britain"
getFlygsRefuge_Mexico:0 "a modest home in Mexico"
getFlygsRefuge_Colombia:0 "a wooden shack in Colombia"
getFlygsRefuge_Somewhere_Else:0 "his hiding spot in the anarchic lands of Africa"

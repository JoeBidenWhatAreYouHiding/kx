ROM_recruit_conspirators:0 "Recruit Monarchist Conspirators"
ROM_recruit_conspirators_desc:0 "We will need loyal men if we are to take down the Green Hydra, and through proper channels of communication, we will find them and bring them to our side."
ROM_conspirators:0 "Decrease the Captain's influence to reduce his power."
ROM_high_society_contacts:0 "High-Society Contacts"
ROM_high_society_contacts_desc:0 "As popular as Codreanu's men can seem, the King is in possession of a vast array of contacts in high society as well; industrialists, aspiring magnates, non-sympathizing nobles and the remnants of the former Conservative Party, de facto headed by the powerful Constantin Argetoianu. By discreetly pulling a few strings and shifting high-society discourse ever more in our illustrious monarch's favour, we can undermine their support from above, ultimately leading to an erosion of their base below."
ROM_sow_discontent:0 "Sow Discontent Among Legionaries"
ROM_sow_discontent_desc:0 "While a daunting movement at a glance, the Legionaries are not immune to factionalism; and royal informants show that the internal divisions among the Legionaries may be deeper than we thought. A few overtures here and there and that pesky Codreanu will be too busy handling his own men to challenge us."
ROM_newspaper_propaganda:0 "Newspaper Propaganda"
ROM_newspaper_propaganda_desc:0 "The written word is a weapon of the highest caliber, and both the king and his green-clad rivals acknowledge this fact.

However, some voices clamour for the establishment of a Romania from the Dniester to the Tisa, claiming that if not now, we will never have this chance."

ROM_entente:0 "Old Entente Ties"
ROM_entente_desc:0 "In 1916, Romania joined the Entente powers at the height of Russian victories against the Central Powers. While we were defeated, the remnants of the Entente have persisted through capitulations and revolutions. Now that Romania is free and independent once more, we are naturally gravitating towards our former allies, and we should formally request to rejoin them in their noble endeavour."
ROM_finish_reunion:0 "The Loose Ends"
ROM_finish_reunion_desc:0 "While we have reunited with Transylvania, there are still further issues at hand, for Romania must be greater still. After all, Greater Romania must now be protected so that it will stand the test of time."
ROM_balkan:0 "The Future Direction"
ROM_balkan_desc:0 "Our quest is two-fold: finishing the dream of Greater Romania and ensuring safe, thriving neighborhood for us. We should ensure that our friends in the region remain so in order to create a stable order for Romania to thrive in."

ROM_nationalization:0 "Nationalization of Foreign Assets"
ROM_nationalization_desc:0 "The Treaty of Bucharest put significant economic assets under the joint control of Romania and the former Central Powers or directly in foreign hands. Black Monday has, however, ruined German economic hegemony and many of their assets in Romania are filing for bankruptcy. Now is the time to put them back in the hands of the state and its people to retake control of our own economy."
ROM_organize_relief_work:0 "Organize Relief Work"
ROM_organize_relief_work_desc:0 "The economic crash was one of the last things we needed at the present moment, but fortunately we have been blessed with fertile soil. It may impact us for a while, but we can withhold some of the grain that was to be exported to make sure our people do not starve."
ROM_safeguard_banks:0 "Safeguard Banking Sector"
ROM_safeguard_banks_desc:0 "Allowing the credit sector to crumble would only lead to a worse economic crisis, as the farmers would be unable to get their money back or pay back their loans, and businesses would fare even worse; the banking sector must be kept afloat so we can have a reserve of money for future projects."
ROM_reorient_economy:0 "Seeking New Markets"
ROM_reorient_economy_desc:0 "While German economic sphere is in ruins there are not many options available for trade deals, but both the Russian and the Entente governments have signalled us of their interest in buying Romanian oil and agricultural products to alleviate their own shortages. This is surely a beautiful start of new friendship."

ROM_continue_the_land_reform:0 "Continue Legionary Reform"
ROM_continue_the_land_reform_desc:0 "Codreanu's ambitious land reform was stopped by opposition from the king and the wealthy landowners, who prefer the unequal status quo. We must break up the great estates and redistribute the land for all instead of just small, aristocratic elite - no matter how much bad blood it is going to create among them."
ROM_compromise_with_the_landholders:0 "Compromise with the Landholders"
ROM_compromise_with_the_landholders_desc:0 "Redistribution of land cannot be done without an agreement with the land-owning aristocracy. Perhaps we can find a compromise with the great estates, one which satisfies both the landowners and the small farmers."
ROM_rural_development_loans:0 "Loans for Small Farmers"
ROM_rural_development_loans_desc:0 "As the Legion considers the peasant to be central to the Romanian nation, it is only natural that we truly reflect our beliefs by economically supporting small farmers. Loans in rural areas, which make up the majority of the country, should be affordable in order to help grow the economy and improve conditions."
ROM_export_more_than_grain:0 "Export More Than Grain"
ROM_export_more_than_grain_desc:0 "In order for the Romanian economy to thrive in a world of markets, diversification is the best way to create a solid national economic foundation. This will ensure that Romania's economy is no longer at the mercy of the grain market and its fluctuating prices."
ROM_begin_mechanization:0 "Mechanized Farming"
ROM_begin_mechanization_desc:0 "Mechanization will exponentially improve the productivity of Romanian farms, which will undoubtedly improve the state of the rural economy. At the same time, it will improve the livelihood of the majority of Romanians and ensure an abundance in food."
ROM_rural_infrastructure_development:0 "Connecting the Countryside"
ROM_rural_infrastructure_development_desc:0 "Not only are rural regions are largely disconnected from urban areas, but they are also disconnected from other rural regions. Connecting the country will bring the people closer together, but this will require significant investment in infrastructure and construction in general. These investments, however, will also drive the economy forwards by creating numerous jobs."
ROM_diversify_agriculture:0 "Diverse Agriculture"
ROM_diversify_agriculture_desc:0 "Romania remains heavily agrarian and will likely remain as such for the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, this does not mean that farmers should depend on a single crop; Romanian farmers must grow diversely to keep the soil and national economy healthy."
ROM_bridge_the_urban_rural_gap:0 "Urban-Rural Community"
ROM_bridge_the_urban_rural_gap_desc:0 "It is no secret that Romania suffers from a heavy rural-urban divide. As the country becomes more and more interconnected, with fewer peasants and workers having never met one another, this divide is slowly healing. Further efforts should be spent on bringing people of different regions and backgrounds closer, as Romanians form one indivisible nation."
ROM_focus_on_quality:0 "Focus on Quality"
ROM_focus_on_quality_desc:0 "Romania will likely never see a developed industrial base comparable to the other great industrial nations of the world. However, instead of focusing on quantity, Romanians should focus on the quality of its limited capabilities in order to secure its own little niche in a large world."
ROM_exploit_the_rivers:0 "Exploit the Rivers"
ROM_exploit_the_rivers_desc:0 "Romania's many rivers provide endless opportunities for growth and development from improved transportation and hydroelectricity. While this will require significant investment from the state, the long-term benefits will be immense."
ROM_restore_the_grazelands:0 "Restore the Grazing Lands"
ROM_restore_the_grazelands_desc:0 "Pasturage for animals are crucial for a healthy agrarian economy and a significant portion of Romania's graze-lands have been lost to industrialization and large estates over the years. The Captain wishes to help restore it in order to improve the country's economic viability seeing that it will heavily affect the peasantry."
ROM_foster_romanian_industry:0 "Foster Romanian Industry"
ROM_foster_romanian_industry_desc:0 "Romania will only become a modern country when its industry is developed to a level equivalent of other Western nations of its size. The king wants to subsidize industry even more to achieve this end in order to create an industry worthy of the nation."
ROM_prosperity_for_all:0 "Prosperity for All"
ROM_prosperity_for_all_desc:0 "For too long, the average Romanian has seen little to no improvement to their condition despite its wealth and growth. With the reforms taking shape, more and more Romanians will be affected by economic development and growth. In the future, the whole nation, not just the wealthy landowners and plutocrats, will actually feel Romania's growing prosperity and become a beacon for other nations to follow."

ROM_engineering:0 "Industrial Development"
ROM_engineering_desc:0 "There is more to industrialization than building more factories. Equipment and tools have to be bought, made, or modernized to improve efficiency. Therefore,we must invest in new industrial technologies in a world of constant development and invention in order for Romanian industry to stay competitive and worthwhile."
ROM_support_malaxa:0 "MALAXA"
ROM_support_malaxa_desc:0 "Nicolae Malaxa is perhaps the most successful Romanian industrialist and certainly one of the wealthiest and well-connected.

ROM_refine_the_refineries:0 "Refine the Refineries"
ROM_refine_the_refineries_desc:0 "The Ploiesti oil fields are known to be some of the most plentiful in Europe. However, the current refineries remain only a fraction of its potential. With some support from the state, we can further expand our oil industry and reap its rewards."

ROM_assess_the_military:0 "Assess the Military"
ROM_assess_the_military_desc:0 "Since the Iron Guard took power, we already violated the Treaty of Bucharest by introducing army conscription, where the treaty limited Romania to an army of 45,000 men. We need to further expand the army, to ensure a victory in future conflicts."
ROM_weapon_contracts:0 "Weapon Contracts"
ROM_weapon_contracts_desc:0 "If Romania is to succeed in future conflict, we need to make sure our industry is up to the task of producing enough equipment for our army."

ROM_legacy_of_berhelot:0 "Legacy of Berthelot"
ROM_legacy_of_berhelot_desc:0 "Henri Berthelot headed the French military mission in Romania during the Weltkrieg. It was largely thanks to his efforts that we were able to rebuild our forces after the 1916 debacle and achieve several victories against a combined Central Powers offensive. As such, his legacy has been enduring among our officers, with many wanting to rebuild the Romanian Army as he had in 1917."
ROM_carpathian_fortresses:0 "The Carpathian Fortresses"
ROM_carpathian_fortresses_desc:0 "It is no secret that we will be fighting in the Carpathians once again soon. The great chain of mountains greatly favours the defenders, and while Austria-Hungary controls the passes, we must be ready to meet their attacks head-on. Fortifications will ensure that any attack will pay a serious price and allow us to counter-attack effectively."
ROM_expand_the_fortifications:0 "Expand the Fortifications"
ROM_expand_the_fortifications_desc:0 "The current line of fortifications is completely inadequate; Moldavia remains poorly defended. The line must be extended to cover the northern passes before we can improve the existing strong points."
ROM_artillery_development:0 "Shells, Not Men"
ROM_artillery_development_desc:0 "We have a severe manpower disadvantage against our likely enemies, making Romanian lives even more valuable. Materiel losses, meanwhile, are far easier to replace. As such, we must stockpile more and more weapons and ammunitions to ensures that our artillery can properly shield our irreplaceable infantry."
ROM_marasti_marasesti_oituz:0 "Lessons of Marasti and Marasesti"
ROM_marasti_marasesti_oituz_desc:0 "The war against the Central Powers are riddled with Romanian tactical victories despite our enemies' strategic victory. The Battles of Marasti and Marasesti are the greatest example of Romanian skill and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. We must learn what made these victories so great and what made the campaign a failure before we fight them again."
ROM_defense_focus:0 "Bleed Our Enemies Dry"
ROM_defense_focus_desc:0 "Let them come to us across the treacherous mountain passes. We will greet them with lead and steel from our guns. We will bleed them dry before they can take even a single Romanian life. This time, they will be the one to foot the bill for this war for national unification."

ROM_spirit_of_aggression:0 "Spirit of Aggression"
ROM_spirit_of_aggression_desc:0 "We will never be able to liberate Romanians across the Carpathians by sitting behind them, hunkered down in bunkers. We must succeed where we failed in 1916 and take the fight to our enemies, or else we will be sitting ducks against our enemies' manoeuvres."
ROM_armour_development:0 "Romanian Armor Development"
ROM_armour_development_desc:0 "Romania's oil industry puts us in a great position to motorize and mechanize our army.

ROM_modern_calarasi:0 "Modern Calarasi"
ROM_modern_calarasi_desc:0 "Calarasi are Romanian cavalrymen that have been around since the early days of the Romanian principalities. With our focus on mobility, it has become imperative that we modernize our cavalry into a modern force with trucks, tanks, and cars as the horseman's value on the battlefield diminishes, but his speed remains essential."
ROM_mobility_and_infiltration:0 "Shock Tactics"
ROM_mobility_and_infiltration_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg has proven that mobility and shock remains the primary way to achieve total victory. We must avoid the static warfare that plagued many fronts and ensure that our forces remain mobile and maintain initiative over the enemy."
ROM_offense_focus:0 "Strike Like Lightning"
ROM_offense_focus_desc:0 "Speed is everything. It means we can strike the enemy first, while maintaining initiative means our foes cannot respond properly, always on the back foot. This is the only way we can overwhelm and destroy the enemy before they can destroy us with numbers."

ROM_mountain_hunters:0 "Carpathian Hunters"
ROM_mountain_hunters_desc:0 "The \"Vanatori\", or Hunters, were formed in 1917, modelled after the French Chasseurs Alpin in response to Austria-Hungary's elite Kaiserschützen.

ROM_high-altitude_training:0 "High-Altitude Training"
ROM_high-altitude_training_desc:0 "The peaks and narrow passes of the Carpathians will inevitably become a battlefield again. Ski troops have proven to be instrumental in this type of terrain and we must ensure that we have soldiers trained in this difficult and specific method of warfare."

ROM_expand_river_flotilla:0 "The Danube Delta"

ROM_black_sea_fleet:0 "Black Sea Fleet"

ROM_modern_randunica:0 "The Modern Randunica"
ROM_modern_randunica_desc:0 "The Randunica was the first modern torpedo boat of the Romanian Navy, launched in 1875. Its symbol is prominent among our officers and naval enthusiasts and our new destroyers will carry its legacy with them onto the Black Sea."
ROM_euxine_raiders:0 "Euxine Raiders"
ROM_euxine_raiders_desc:0 "Submarines are now proven raiders. The previous war made that very obvious, and the Romanian Navy should take full advantage of their capabilities to wreak havoc throughout the Black Sea."
ROM_the_king_ferdinand:0 "The King Ferdinand"
ROM_the_king_ferdinand_desc:0 "A proper flagship for the Romanian Navy has been envisioned for quite some time, but never made reality. This dream must be made a reality as we become a serious power in the Black Sea. Considering our capabilities and limitations, a cruiser will certainly do."
ROM_black_sea_dominance:0 "Royal Navy of the Black Sea"
ROM_black_sea_dominance_desc:0 "The Black Sea is one of the major economic artery for our nation; seeking to achieve supremacy over it is merely natural to protect our interests. Just as the British once ruled the waves, we, Romanians, will rule the Black Sea. It is, after all, a far more realistic and practical goal for our navy."
ROM_river_gunboats:0 "Expand the Danube Flotilla"
ROM_river_gunboats_desc:0 "The Danube Flotilla proved to be instrumental in harassing the Central Powers' offensives while supporting our own land forces during the war. As it is likely to fight its Austro-Hungarian counterpart once more, it should be further expanded."

ROM_ground_support_operations:0 "Flying Artillery"
ROM_ground_support_operations_desc:0 "Light bomber aircraft rapidly gained the moniker \"flying artillery\" during the Weltkrieg, as their use on the field has been rapidly seen as a new form of artillery.

ROM_rain_fire_upon_them:0 "Rain Fire Upon Them"

ROM_drop_them_from_the_sky_desc:0 "The Air Force's primary goal is to destroy the enemy's aircraft. This is the only way to protect both our soldiers and citizens from enemy warplanes. Any bombing mission should only be considered when we have achieved air superiority."

ROM_king_under_surveillance:0 "King Under Surveillance"
ROM_king_under_surveillance_desc:0 "While the institution of the monarchy is respectable, it is clear that it must be kept from intervening too much within our affairs. By making sure that vital court offices are always staffed by our men, we can reduce the king's manoeuvring room enough that he will have no choice but to cooperate. If the king is the symbol of the nation, he must not stand in the path of its will, as embodied by us."

ROM_agrarian_base_desc:0 "Even though our movement originated from nationalist studentry, our first proper base of support was the peasantry, and we shall honour our past in more ways than one by carefully promoting our people's agrarian heritage.

ROM_tradition_eternal_desc:0 "It is not our way to recklessly send our men dashing into danger, as losing the cream of our crop would only weaken our strength just like what happened at Nicopole or at Crecy all those years ago.

ROM_obligatory_camp_service:0 "Obligatory Camp Service"
ROM_obligatory_camp_service_desc:0 "In order for our men to be as prepared for life as possible, the Captain has decided that each member of the Legion must fulfil a term of service within our expanding work camp service.

ROM_expand_hierarchy:0 "Expand the Hierarchy of the Legion"
ROM_expand_hierarchy_desc:0 "As our movement grows, the Legion's hierarchic structure must grow as well, not only to accommodate the increased numbers but to maintain the Captain's firm grasp as well.

ROM_spiritual-national_guide:0 "Spiritual-National Guide"
ROM_spiritual-national_guide_desc:0 "The Captain is more than just the prime minister, more than the leader of the Legion and the Party; no, he is a spiritual and national guide for the Romanian nation, who tirelessly works for our country's benefit and sets forth the path we take towards our country's new future.

ROM_alliance_with_the_church_desc:0 "As much as some clerics would prefer to dissociate from us, we still have been very stalwart in the defence of the Holy Church and the Right Faith.

ROM_agrarian_price_controls:0 "Agrarian Price Controls"
ROM_agrarian_price_controls_desc:0 "The market, while an useful tool to attain great wealth for our nation, can also be an unyielding malefactor for our poor, who can end up having to resort to bartering or subsistence farming to get the foodstuff they need. No longer, for we will impose a set of relatively static prices for basic foodstuff, so that years from now the basic price for bread as imagined by everyone shall be the one dictated by us."
ROM_legionary_culture_centers:0 "Legionary Culture Centres"
ROM_legionary_culture_centers_desc:0 "Without proper awareness of our culture, we would lose ourselves in the fogs of history; to avoid this prospective shame, we will open up a series of cultural centres across the country, meant to educate the Romanian people to their heritage and help them see their great purpose, sponsored and aided along by our faithful cavaliers in green of course."
ROM_numerus_valachicus:0 "Numerus Valachicus"
ROM_numerus_valachicus_desc:0 "Our country's university system has a worrying proportion of non-Romanian students. In the past, our student population had grown weary of this perceived intrusion, lighting up the spark that would lead to our movement's founding.

ROM_legionary_cooperatives:0 "Legionary Cooperatives"
ROM_legionary_cooperatives_desc:0 "Through the years of combat and rulership, our system of cooperatives has proven itself an useful way to make money and increase Legionary ties, both between themselves and the average people.

ROM_court_the_king_desc:0 "His Majesty reportedly was aghast when he heard of our election victory, and considering the troubles that led to this peculiar situation, he cannot be blamed. However, to avoid the troubles we had with the last king, Carol II, we should at least try to play nice with His Majesty; if it seems like we try to uphold democracy in some way, the chances of being ousted early will decrease accordingly."
ROM_the_first_among_parties:0 "The First Among the Parties"
ROM_the_first_among_parties_desc:0 "Our status as the first among equals within the evolving Romanian political system is growing more and more uncontested by the day; a development appreciated by our great Captain, who ended up growing to be more of a politician than a combatant like back in the day. We should continue our efforts to further legitimize ourselves and carve a niche for the Movement that will stand the test of time."
ROM_green-tinted_democracy:0 "Green-Tinted Democracy?"
ROM_green-tinted_democracy_desc:0 "While different from our previous goal of uncontested rule, we have managed to turn our surprising victory into a chance to permanently leave our mark within the Romanian political system, and ensure a permanent niche for us no matter what may come in the future.

ROM_legionary_revolution:0 "Legionary Revolution"
ROM_legionary_revolution_desc:0 "As venerable as our Captain was, his attempt to adherence to the old party system led to his murder by his opponents. It was by calling back to our past as a revolutionary cell that we have reasserted control, and now we are in a position to truly unleash our own revolution.

Fortunately, our gracious Conducator Cantacuzino knows just what must be done and what traits to foster to maintain the Romanian people's real fighting spirit.

#Intro
romania.0.t:0 "Kingdom of Romania, 1936"
romania.0.d:0 "The Kingdom of Romania was still a relatively young country when it joined the Weltkrieg in 1916 with grand ambitions of taking Transylvania from the Hungarians, a dream that remains unrealized to this day. Despite some initial successes in 1916, the small country was quickly overwhelmed by German, Austrian and Bulgarian troops. Against all odds, the Romanian Army did not break and instead established new positions around Iasi. With help of the Russians and the French they rebuilt their strength and repelled the Central Powers again and again. The end only came when the Russian Revolution and collapse of the Eastern Front made Romania's position untenable.\n\nMany young men had died for an ideal that ultimately proved just out of reach, and the situation in the country itself had improved for naught. The Treaty of Bucharest was bitter, even more so because the Romanian army had fought well. With this, the stab-in-the-back narrative emerged – Romania was betrayed by the Russians, they were left alone by the Western Entente, they were sabotaged from the inside by traitorous minorities such as Jews. Radical movements rose quickly, fueled by bitterness, revanchism and social issues such as unequal land use. By 1936 the strongest of those movements is the Legion of the Archangel Michael, popularly known as the Legionary Movement, led by young and charismatic Corneliu Codreanu, the Capitan of the Iron Guard.\n\nIn 1927, King Ferdinand passed away and was succeeded by his son, Carol II. Even though Carol had a reputation for being quite the womanizer the war had really left its mark on the king. His dream is clear: to succeed in where his father had failed.  In his quest the king found an ally equally driven and struck a deal with Codreanu. Two men united in their revanchist fervor tore apart the democratic system in the 1933 elections. After the assassination of Prime Minister I. G. Duca by the Iron Guard, Codreanu formed the first Legionary government: the first step towards Greater Romania.\n\nWhile the king and the Captain might be allies in their revanchist project, it is clear they ultimately do not wish to share power. The so-called ‘Great Game’ between these two men began quickly after the elections after Codreanu started his ambitious land reform, an issue very popular among his base. Influential landowners appealed to the king, who in turn forced Codreanu to halt his reforms. With the growing enmity between two men the power struggle can only get more fierce, with neither one ready to give up power. As long as they share the common goal of Greater Romania they will work together, but after that...only God knows."
romania.0.a:0 "A new future for Romania!"
romania.0.b: "So how does this Great Game work?"
#Great Game Mechanics
romania.1.t:0 "Mechanics of the Great Game"
romania.1.d:0 "There is an additional resource used by both Codreanu and the king, Influence. New laws and policies require approval of both the Legionary-controlled Assembly and the king. This forces both parties to make concessions to drive their own agenda.\n\nAfter completing either focus Entrench Party Control or Lay the Seeds for the Camarilla you will unlock a set of decisions to interact with the system from either Codreanu’s or from Carol’s point of view. The decision of the political path is a decision to pick a side, and if you manage to keep that side in power after the Unification your nation will be stronger than if it changes control.\n\nIn addition to the decisions, §bInfluence§! is gained from the political branch of the focus tree and it is primarily spent on the land reform branch, which requires influence to advance. But beware, your opponent also has their own Influence which gives them more power, enabling many events not necessarily in your advantage."
romania.1.a:0 "To the victor goes the spoils!"
#Union Day
romania.7.t:0 "Union Day"
romania.7.d:0 "Union Day represents the Union of the Principalities of Moldova and Wallachia on the 24th of January, 1859, when Alexandru Ioan Cuza was elected as 'Domnitor' in both principalities as a way to bypass the ruling that the two cannot unite in a single state. It is regarded as a National Holiday in Romania."
romania.7.a:0 "Everything for the Fatherland!"
##Greater Union Day WIP

##Black Monday
romania.2.t:0 "Berlin Crash Hits Bucharest"
romania.2.d:0 "Today was a dreadful day for the stock market of Bucharest as many important banks and corporations went into a nosedive after the chain reaction that began with the crash of the Berlin stock market. Many businesses in Romania have been owned by large German and Austrian corporations, which are now in ruins. The unemployment rate has climbed sky-high and the exports sector has been hit bad after the demand for oil and agricultural products in Central Europe has plummeted."
romania.2.a:0 "Even now they find ways to torment us."

##Nationalization of the Foreign Assets
romania.3.t:0 "Nationalization of German Corporations"
romania.3.d:0 "As German banks collapsed, so did the German corporations owning large parts of Romanian oil industry. The exports-based economy of Romania crashed hard after the demand for oil and agricultural products hit the rock bottom in Reichspakt, which has been Romania's main trading partner. Unemployment soared sky-high in a fortnight, and our largest bank is on the precipice of collapse.\n While most non-syndicalist countries simply have to endure the collapse, our government holds a significant control over the economical system. Should we desire so, we could obtain the assets of crashed German corporations quite cheaply and nationalize the refinery industry, saving thousands of Romanian jobs in the process. This might not be a popular move in Berlin, however, but it would send a strong message about Codreanu's government and its dedication to the well-being of all Romanians."
romania.3.a:0 "Enough of Berlin. Nationalize German-owned industries."
romania.3.b:0 "Continue with nationalization, but pay the corporations modest price."

##Germans hear about the nationalization
romania.69.t:0 "Romania Nationalizes the Oil Fields"
romania.69.d1:0 "After the complete crash of Oil-Lands Leasehold Company managing the Ploiesti oil fields Codreanu's government proceeded to nationalize the assets of the bankrupt corporation. It is yet another case of Romanian breaking the Bucharest Treaty, but there is little we can do to stop them - neither does the public care much about the issue."
romania.69.d2:0 "After the complete crash of Oil-Lands Leasehold Company managing the Ploiesti oil fields Codreanu's government proceeded to nationalize the assets of the bankrupt corporation. They did offer a 'fair price' of the company, though - which is practically meaningless gesture, but it is a gesture of good will nonetheless. There is little we can do to stop them - neither does the public care much about the issue."
romania.69.a:0 "If they think they can survive without Mitteleuropa, so be it!"
romania.69.b:0 "We're too busy to worry about petty things."

##Organize Relief Work
romania.4.t:0 "Relief Work for the Unemployed"
romania.4.d:0 "Even though we have alleviated the effects of the economic recession quite effectively, there's still huge number of unemployed in Romania. The government proposes state-funding of relief work in Iron Guard-administrated labour corps, while the king wishes to support private industrialists to provide relief jobs. While the first option would be assured cure to the unemployment, the proponents of King's policy argue it would be only temporary measure which does not benefit the economy as whole."
romania.4.a:0 "The Conducator will find work for his people."
romania.4.b:0 "Economic recovery needs private sector!"
##Safeguard Banking Sector
romania.5.t:0 "Banca de Credit Roman Saved!"
romania.5.d:0 "After the bankruptcy of the large bank Marmorosch-Blank in 1931 the government created safeguards to prevent such economic catastrophes in the future. The Superior Banking Council was created to regulate and investigate the banking sector in 1934, and the institution has never been more necessary. While banks in many countries crashed hard and fast, a total collapse of Banca de Credit Roman was prevented through the SBC safeguards. The catastrophe that broke the backs of great, international German banks left the Romanian ones surprisingly unharmed."
romania.5.a:0 "Great!"

##Entente Trade Deals
romania.6.t:0 "The Future of Romania"
romania.6.d:0 "As the year 1936 begins, the struggle between the nation's two competing leaders, King Carol II and Prime Minister Codreanu, is entering a new phase. Deadlocked for some time, the two are running out of space to manoeuvre around each other. With growing frequency, they are starting to collide head-on and it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the facade of cooperation. As it stands, the king and the Captain are both realizing that the time to take the other out for good is approaching. As the two personalities stand to clash, people will be increasingly forced to pick a side or face the consequences of neutrality alone."
romania.6.a:0 "I will stand by Codreanu and his Legionaries"
romania.6.b:0 "Carol II is the rightful ruler of all Romania"


#Continue the land reform flavor
romania.68.t:0 "Long-Awaited Land Reform"
romania.68.d1:0 "There has been multiple attempts to conduct a comprehensive reform of land ownership in Romania after the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the most ambitious attempt to solve the unequal land ownership was the Legionary land reform of 1934, which came to a halt after the wealthy aristocrats asked the king to intervene on their behalf. This time Prime Minister Codreanu is defiant to go through with the large-scale plans of breaking up the large estates and give the farmholds to the peasants who actually farm them. These large estates form easily over half of all arable land in Romania.\n\nThe aristocracy seems quite worried about Codreanu's plans, and there have already been multiple appeals to the king to stop or by the very least milden the planned reform program. As the king does wield power to ultimately block any laws the parliament passes, his opinions and influence cannot be ignored. It is hard to imagine that he would actually block the reform, but he will surely aim to get his own ideas incorporated to the greatest restructuring of Romanian economy in the twentieth century."
romania.68.d2:0 "There has been multiple attempts to conduct a comprehensive reform of land ownership in Romania after the Weltkrieg. Perhaps the most ambitious attempt to solve the unequal land ownership was the Legionary land reform of 1934, which came to a halt after the wealthy aristocrats asked the king to intervene on their behalf. King Carol II protected the rights of the aristocrats, but he did also show Codreanu his true colors.\n\nLand reform is still a necessary one, though. Land use in Romanian countryside is both unequal and ineffective. Unlike the Legionary vision of breaking up the large estates, the king cannot rely on such brutish methods. Instead the government should aim to work with the landholders, not against them. Actual legislative power is in the hands of the Legionaries, though - which will require giving them some influence over the reform process."
romania.68.a:0 "It is our duty to the peasants of this land."

##Great Game events
#IG infiltrates court
romania.10.t:0 "Double Agent in the Camarilla!"
romania.10.d:0 "The Camarilla is the unofficial privy council of His Majesty and is filled with his supporters and advisors. On the other hand, the social circle around the king is quite wide and it was only a matter of time before the Iron Guard would successfully infiltrate it. The information they managed to acquire could cause a scandal involving a member of the Camarilla if the double agent isn't taken care of in time."
romania.10.a:0 "The royal scandal is unveiled!"
romania.10.b:0 "Silence him."
#Street violence
romania.11.t:0 "Violence in the Streets!"
romania.11.d:0 "While the Legion holds parliamentary activities on a tight leash, opposition to Codreanu across the political spectrum was never fully silenced. Earlier today, activists had taken to the streets in protest, only to be met by violence as Codreanu's Greenshirts descended on them. While it is uncertain whether their leader ordered their actions, we are in a position to turn a blind eye on the fighting and let the Iron Guard silence the dissidents, or have security forces intervene to fight the Greenshirts."
romania.11.a:0 "Let the degenerates shout."
romania.11.b:0 "They're not the only ones who can fight!"
#IG passes populist policies
romania.12.t:0 "Codreanu's Populist Policies"
romania.12.d:0 "With the Legion largely in control of parliament, Codreanu, as Prime Minister, submitted a piece of legislation to the Chamber of Deputies. It is an open secret among parliamentarians that the legislation has little substance and is meant to woo the people and garner support for the Captain's land reform program. Carol II's Camarilla is uneasy about letting Codreanu get away with such blatant demagoguery and suggest that the king veto the legislation, but doing so would hurt his popularity among a large segment of the population. Alternatively, it was also suggested that the king could use his influence or threaten the Prime Minister into giving credit to His Majesty instead, boosting the image of the royalists instead."
romania.12.a:0 "Accept the legislation."
romania.12.b:0 "Veto their sad attempt to bribe the people."
romania.12.c:0 "Pass their policies as your own."
#IG tightens censorship
romania.13.t:0 "Codreanu Tightens Censorship."
romania.13.d:0 "In another move to silence opposition, a newspaper belonging to the opposition was forcefully shut down by the Iron Guard before they could start today's print. Claiming that the paper had a history of publishing libelous publications, the Captain loudly proclaimed that until the media could \"mature\", censorship laws are to be tightened in order to protect Romanians from their lies."
romania.13.a:0 "At least it silences the dissenters."
romania.13.b:0 "Focus on internal party media instead."
#Legionary rally
romania.14.t:0 "Large Legionary Rally Gathering!"
romania.14.d:0 "The Legion of Archangel Michael prides itself in their mass rallies gathering thousands of supporters. These rallies, however, feature firey speeches containing blatant anti-Semitic rhetoric and increasing calls for violence against perceived enemies of the nation. Beside, the king see these as displays of power from his rival as a blatant threat to his rule. Of course, King Carol could bestow Codreanu with his royal generosity and allow him and his thugs to parade all they want in exchange for favours, such as letting His Majesty take centre stage, or forbid it altogether. However, this would likely result in a livid response from the Legion and their notorious Greenshirts."
romania.14.a:0 "Forbid their little meeting."
romania.14.b:0 "Allow it... with a price."
#King's public appearance
romania.15.t:0 "King Appears in Public"
romania.15.d:0 "Until recently, King Carol has often appeared alongside Prime Minister Codreanu in public in a show of unity between the nation's two leaders. However, the king has begun appearing in public on his own, often impromptu without notifying the Captain. It is no secret that Carol is hoping to build up a personal base of support independent from the Legion and it is clearly a threat to Codreanu's own position. Either we let the king parade and avoid a controversy as the nation needs to appear united, or protest these displays as Carol selfishly threatens to sabotage their cooperation."
romania.15.a:0 "Let him entertain the masses if he so wishes."
romania.15.b:0 "Protest his decision."
#Carol's conspirators revealed
romania.16.t:0 "Royalist Conspirators in the Officer Corps"
romania.16.d:0 "The Royal Romanian Army has always remained independent of the struggle between Carol II and Codreanu even if the two leaders have supporters within it. It has become clear, however, that a number of officers are showing increasingly blatant loyalty to the king, potentially trying to gain the Army's support against Codreanu. Before this royal conspiracy can grow out of hand, we may want to convince the General Staff to punish these loud-mouthed royalists. However, Codreanu is wary of meddling in military affairs, for he knows how much they despise meddling and how dependent he is on their aloof attitude towards politics."
romania.16.a:0 "Punish them harshly."

romania.17.t:0 "King's High Society Contacts"
romania.17.d:0 "King Carol II is an active member of Romania's high society. From wealthy industrialists to artists and socialites, he tends to support them both personally and financially, and they appreciate His Majesty's support. Many of them are eager to meet the king in person and enjoy His ear for whatever trouble or project of theirs needs it. On the other hand, Prime Minister Codreanu has been wary of these contacts as they threaten his own standing in the complex circle the Romanian government has become. He may use his influence to limit these contacts and ensure that Romanian high socity doesn't move against him."
romania.17.a:0 "Let them meet the king."
romania.17.b:0 "Perhaps the king is busy at the moment."
#King sows discontent among legion
romania.18.t:0 "Dissent in the Iron Guard"
romania.18.d:0 "The Legion of Archangel Michael, or Iron Guard, has become a powerful mass movement with a huge following. Despite strict ideological discipline, however, the Guard is not monolithic and it increasingly faces non-conformism within its wide membership. These non-conformist tendencies, be they towards radicalism or moderatism, have allowed the king to exploit divisions within the movement leading some young, outspoken Legionnaires to criticize the Legion's leadership. That these dissidents will be punished is a certainty, but degree of said punishment is not - Cordeanu may not wish to advertise this dissidence in the Legion or alienate younger members whose support remains tentative."
romania.18.a:0 "Punish the non-conformists."
romania.18.b:0 "They are young, they will learn."
#Anti-IG newspaper propaganda
romania.19.t:0 "Anti-Legionary Propaganda"
romania.19.d:0 "Newspapers throughout the nation have sprouted out recently, all churning propaganda against Codreanu and the Legion. When the Greenshirts tried to shut them down, however, they either found the paper trail leading to people under the king's protection or were ambushed by the king's own paramilitary if they pushed on. For the time being, propaganda against the government has been successfully spread all over Romania."
romania.19.a:0 "Damn that King!"
#Legionary Workers Corps
romania.20.t:0 "Corpul Muncitoresc Legionar"
romania.20.d:0 "The Legionary Workers' Corps is Codreanu's attempt to co-opt syndicalist methods and supporters into his ultranationalist movement. In essence, the Corps is a corporatist association of Romanian workers in a strict hierarchy similar to the Iron Guard intending to replace trade unions. While it claims to aim for equality of workers and factory owners, it is by-and-large an attempt to attract more urban workers into the Legion and mobilize it as another paramilitary wing to support the movement."
romania.20.a:0 "Better green than red unions!"
romania.20.b:0 "We should restrain their influence."
#Legion Expands
romania.21.t:0 "Iron Guard Expands"
romania.21.d:0 "Membership into the Legion of Archangel Michael has soared recently thanks to Codreanu's recent successes and populist rhetoric. It is clear that his movement is more attractive to common Romanians regardless of the Captain's Demagoguery, hurting the king's reputation and popularity in the process."
romania.21.a:0 "Damn them!"
#Revanchist Rally
romania.22.t:0 "Revanchist Rally"
romania.22.d:0 "Revanchism has become a permanent fixture in Romanian politics. No political movement, moderate or radical, can avoid it and opposing it has led to horrible consequences for politicians perceived as \"traitors\". In recent years, the Iron Guard has embodied Romania's revanchist spirit and has been shamelessly fueling it in their rhetoric. Because of it, revanchist rallies have become intimately tied with the Legion where they have been able to thrive. Restraining these rallies would prove costly, unpopular affairs even if it would limit the Guard's influence and pervasion."
romania.22.a:0 "Everything For the Country!"
romania.22.b:0 "The agitators should be restrained."
#Cross Brotherhoods
romania.23.t:0 "Cross Brotherhoods Surge"
romania.23.d:0 "The Brotherhood of the Cross is the youth wing of the Legion of Archangel Michael and has become an increasingly prominent institution among Romanian children. Recently, their membership has surged, likely due to how pervasive it has become after numerous recruitment drives and state support. Brotherhoods across the country are helping the Legion grow and will prove to be essential in the long-term as it secures future membership into the Guard and organizes the future core of the movement."
romania.23.a:0 "Everything For the Country!"
#King Strengthens the Camarilla
romania.24.t:0 "King Expands the Camarilla"
romania.24.d:0 "While the Camarilla remains an unofficial organization, Carol II has steadily been strengthening it, clearly intending for it to become an official government institution. For now, the little privy council's actual influence remains limited, and Codreanu can tolerate its existence, but it would be wise to keep an eye on them should we decide to let it exist for a while longer."

#King's Philantrophy
romania.25.t:0 "Carol II's Philanthropy"
romania.25.d:0 "In a clear attempt at improving his poor image, King Carol donated large sums of money to numerous charities across the country. Hoping the create an image as a generous philanthropist, the king made sure that news of these donations were made very public and spread through Royalist papers. While we could simply ignore the king's blatant challenge, we could also try to outshine him by publicly increasing state expenditures towards charities and services."
romania.25.a:0 "Let him spend his unjust wealth."
romania.25.b:0 "Show them that the state cares too!"
#Royal Rural Outreach
romania.26.t:0 "King Tours the Countryside"
romania.26.d:0 "As the king continues to improve his abysmal public image, his recent tours have led him to the Romanian countryside where he has made many public gatherings and speeches exalting Romanian farmers and inspecting results from the land reform program. We could simply ignore the king's pathetic attempt at wooing our support base and not allow it to gain even more attention, but it may be wise to counter it and make sure Romanians are reminded of who truly cares about their well-being."
romania.26.a:0 "He should stay there!"

#Sentinels of the Fatherland
romania.27.t:0 "Straja Tarii Founded"
romania.27.d:0 "The Sentinel of the Motherland is the youth wing of the Royalist movement meant to counter the growing strength of the Legion's own Cross Brotherhoods. Sentinels are bound by a creed: Faith and Labour for Country and King. Like the Cross Brotherhoods, the Sentinel offers military training for Romania's youth, forming them as loyal patriots of the nation and its King, the \"Great Sentinel\". While we will be unable to discern its success for some time, what is clear is that the two youth movements are bound to clash should the king and Codreanu split."
romania.27.a:0 "What misguided young patriots."
#Political assassination
romania.28.t:0 "Opposition Politician Assassinated!"
romania.28.d:0 "A politician of the opposition was found dead this morning after assassins broke into his home and shot him. While it is an open secret that neither Legionaries or Royalists are upset about the death of a dissident, both movements are eager to take advantage of this opportunity for their own gains. As such, the Royalists are eager to properly punish the assassins and show respect for due process, the Legion is gearing for mass arrests in order to weaken their political rivals further."
romania.28.a:0 "Too bad."

romania.28.e:0 "These men are heroes."
#Street Violence 
romania.29.t:0 "Blood on the Streets"
romania.29.d:0 "Paramilitary violence has become increasingly common as the Iron Guard grew in prominence and numbers. While political opposition hasn't been going down quietly since the Codreanu became Prime Minister, no other political group has been able to organize as ruthless a paramilitary as the Legion's Iron Guard and their attacks on dissidents have largely been one-sided unless security forces intervened (and they largely didn't). Stopping their violence and dispersing the armed men will be a costly affair, even if it helps being peace in the streets. Besides, their thuggery has been handy to keep opposition to both the king and government weak."
romania.29.a:0 "They were enemies of the nation."
romania.29.b:0 "The law must be obeyed."
romania.29.c:0 "The war for the nation's souls is won in the streets!"
#Legionaries target synagogue
romania.30.t:0 "Legionaries Attack Synagogues"
romania.30.d:0 "Anti-Semitism is definitely not new in Romania and has been widespread for some time, but the Legion has brought it to previously-unimaginable levels. A common scapegoat in the past, Jewish Romanians have increasingly become targets as revanchist sentiments radicalized large segments of the Romanian population. With alarming regularity, Greenshirts attack synagogues throughout the country with security forces often turning a blind eye. As yet another anti-Semitic incident as occurred, it remains to be seen how the divided authorities will respond."
romania.30.a:0 "There are always radicals."
romania.30.b:0 "Punish those responsible."
#Strikes
romania.31.t:0 "Factory Workers Strike"
romania.31.d:0 "While the Red Scare caused by the fall of France to syndicalism has largely blown over, succeeding Romanian governments have been quick to stamp out labour agitation wherever it sprouted. With the country gradually industrializing, labour disputes increased. The Legion has been harsh on any kind of apparent \"syndicalization\" as Greenshirts are regularly employed or volunteered as strikebreakers. With factory workers threatening to go on strike in Bucharest, authorities merely have to say the word and the Iron Guard will make short work of it. Of course, negotiations are not out of the question in order to avoid a crisis, or even simply wait it out until the workers give up."
romania.31.a:0 "Let them strike."
romania.31.b:0 "Negotiate a compromise."
romania.31.c:0 "Punish them harshly!"
#Democratic opposition
romania.32.t:0 "Opposition Speaks against Codreanu"
romania.32.d:0 "While Codreanu is prime minister with a comfortable majority in the Chamber of Deputies, it is by no means a monopoly of parliamentary activities. With Codreanu tightening censorship, unleashing his Greenshirts at any threat to his rule, and the king seemingly turning a blind eye to His Prime Minister's abuses, a gathering of opposition politicians have publicly criticized the Codreanu government's disregard for the Constitution. The demonstration remains relatively small as the Iron Guard keeps an eye on it, waiting for orders to disperse them."
romania.32.a:0 "They do have a point."
romania.32.b:0 "Silence them!"

#Carol and Lupescu
romania.61.t:0 "King's Mistress"
romania.61.d:0 "The Romanian royal family, like every other, has a long history with extramarital affairs and marital infidelity. There is, however, an expectation of discretion: scandals are to be avoided and liaisons terminated should such a scandal occur. The king, however, not only appears to have no discretion whatsoever; indeed, he seems to take great pleasure in publicly flaunting his womanizing lifestyle.\n\nThe origins of Elena \"Magda\" Lupescu are a source of confusion and debate. It is known that she inherited her Catholicism through her mother, who is a Jewish-born convert; her father, also Jewish-born, is an apothecary who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy. She was briefly married to a certain Lieutenant Ion Tampeanu, but divorced some time after the war. It is not known when she met the king, but she only started appearing alongside him after he was crowned and she quickly became one of his closest advisors.\n\nThe king has long been known as a playboy, but he has been acting differently with this recent mistress. Unlike his previous affairs, the relationship appears very strong, giving Magda significant, and apparently lasting, influence within Carol's inner circle. On the other hand, she has increasingly been targeted by opponents of King Carol as they try to weaken his position."
romania.61.a:0 "It's not like the king can deny her anything."
romania.61.b:0 "This is exactly the kind of degeneracy that will bring our nation into ruin!"
#Carol and Lupescu 2
romania.62.t:0 "Smear Campaign against Lupescu"
romania.62.d:0 "The king's mistress, Magda Lupescu, has recently been targeted by Legion-aligned papers across Romania in a rather obvious attempt to smear her name. The exposé describes the \"Jewish whore\" as the power behind the throne, accusing her of manipulating Carol and subverting Codreanu's government, especially regarding his land reform program. The Jewish origins of her parents are emphasized to further demonize her in the eyes of an increasingly anti-Semitic public and place her as a centrepiece of an anti-Romanian conspiracy. The king is absolutely livid to say the least and the campaign could very well cause a public split between him and his Prime Minister."
romania.62.a:0 "How dare they? They must issue public apologies instantly!"
romania.62.b:0 "Perhaps she should keep low profile for some time."
romania.62.c:0 "What a mess they have caused."
#King demands an apology
romania.63.t:0 "King Demands an Apology"
romania.63.d:0 "As expected, King Carol II publicly admonished the Legion for their recent smear campaign against his mistress, Madame Lupescu. In retaliation, the king has demanded that Prime Minister Codreanu publicly apologize for the incident and properly punish the Legionaries responsible. While Codreanu has made little effort to hide his disgust of the mistress, he and the king depend on an image of cooperation in their common goal to forge Greater Romania and the incident threatens to expose how bitterly opposed they truly are. On the other hand, it would be a public humiliation for the Legion to bow down to Carol and could hurt the unity of the movement as the Captain depends on a strong cult of personality."
romania.63.a:0 "Even if they are right, it is not their place to judge the king... yet."
romania.63.b:0 "The Captain will always stand by his men!"
#Codreanu compromises
romania.64.t:0 "Codreanu Sides with the King"
romania.64.d:0 "In order to avoid a public dispute with the king, Codreanu agreed to his demands and publicly apologized for the Legion's attack on the king's mistress. This is a clear victory for Carol, but the Captain insists that relations with His Majesty need to remain smooth for the time being. He has promised to make sure the offenders will be tried and punished accordingly."
romania.64.a:0 "Legionary tribunal will be enough!"
romania.64.b:0 "This is beyond your little cult."

romania.65.t:0 "Codreanu Stands by his Men"
romania.65.d:0 "Unwilling to be humiliated by the king, the Captain refused to apologize, standing by his men's actions against Madame Lupescu. For now, the crisis continues, threatening stability and the fragile alliance between Legionaries and Royalists."
romania.65.a:0 "It is our duty to tell the truth, even if the king does not like it."
romania.65.b:0 "Suppress their publications."

#Codreanu criticized
romania.66.t:0 "Codreanu Faces Criticism from his Own"
romania.66.d:0 "While the Captain appears to be the all-powerful leader of the Iron Guard, there have been whispers among Legionaries about his submissive response to the Lupescu affair. While the Legion is highly-disciplined and the cult of personality centred around Codreanu is strong, the Captain's recent actions have shaken this once-absolute confidence. Regardless, Codreanu is adamant that this was the right course of action and that the alliance of convenience with the king is still necessary."
romania.66.a:0 "We can never achieve Greater Romania if we keep bickering about some Jewish whore."
romania.66.b:0 "Is it traitors I hear?"

#Battle of the wills
romania.67.t:0 "Battle of the Wills"
romania.67.d:0 "The crisis between King Carol II and Captain Codreanu has reached breaking point as it has spilled over into parliament. In the struggle between the two leaders over the Lupescu smear campaign, Carol finally threatened to sack Codreanu and replace him, prompting the Captain to finally give in to the king's demands. However, the damage has already been done, and both men claim victory over the other, for Codreanu was forced to stand down, but not without a fight for his men."
romania.67.a:0 "Codreanu has to give in, for the sake of the nation."

Our scouts have been able to create accurate and up-to-date maps of the area, including the enemy's presence, which will help commanders on the field navigate the treacherous terrain. Collaborators have already been contacted and allies within Transylvania are already monitoring enemy troop movements.

Delegates of the Romanian National Party, despite having previously claimed to only wish for autonomy, have finally revealed their treachery in a call to arms against the Monarchy. They formed the National Assembly of Romanians of Transylvania and Hungary in Gyulafehérvár and unanimously declared \"the unification of those Romanians and of all the territories inhabited by them with Romania.\"\n\nAs their treachery was plainly expected, the Armed Forces have launched their contingency plan for a Romanian invasion including a popular uprising in Transylvania.

romania.56.d:0 "For several decades, the Romanian population of eastern Hungary has been unhappy with our rule. As the principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia united and secured their place as an independent state in the Balkans, many Transylvanians believe that their region is destined to be united with their brethren across the Carpathians regardless of our just, ancient historical claims over the region. During the Weltkrieg, Romania even attempted to take Transylvania by force, taking advantage of our weakness as we fought off the endless Russian hordes. Their defeat in the war has done little to weaken Romanian nationalism in the region.\n\nDespite the restrictions of the Treaty of Bucharest, the hostile regime in Bucharest has recently resumed propaganda efforts against us. Decrying our rule as tyrannical and oppressive, recent unrest in the cities of Arad, Kolozsvár and Nagyszeben have led to increased passive resistance against authorities. So far, the investigation has only found only ties with activists of the Romanian National Party (PNR), a legal party representing Romanian interests in Hungary, and not the hostile government in Bucharest. PNR leaders maintain that they wish to secure the autonomy of Transylvania and other Romanian-majority areas rather than separatism, claiming that they have no ties with the undemocratic regime in Bucharest."

This, of course, already put a strain on our relations with Romania, but it has come to the Gendarmerie's attention that a sister movement of the Iron Guard in Transylvania has been rapidly growing since the start of recent unrest in the region.

romania.35.d:0 "As Codreanu's Legion controls the lower house of Parliament, they have significant room to manoeuvrer in the legislative process. As such, Codreanu is using this fact as a tool to push his land reform legislation through despite our best efforts to control it. Supporters of the king, however, are numerous in the Senate, giving them the opportunity to use obstructionist means to slowly kill the legislation. On the other hand, we could let the Iron Guard win this round and save our breath for another, more important, battle. Otherwise, the king's extensive powers could be used to outright kill the law there and now, although the Legion is unlikely to take such a forceful response very well."

#Foreshadowing about Stelescu
romania.73.t:0 "Mihai Stelescu"
romania.73.d:0 "The youngest member of Romanian parliament and staunch supporter of the Legionary movement, Mihai Stelescu, had quickly risen in the ranks of the movement. He was in many ways the very example of the Legionary his Captain desired: radical, bold and staunchly nationalistic. However, he had gathered his share of enemies during his fast promotion through the ranks of the Guard into becoming one of Codreanu's lieutenants. As such many within the Legion are at least suspicious of the young leader, and some even doubt his loyalty to the Captain. Regardless, the whispers are enough to have gotten the attention of Royalist agents who are more than eager to exploit any cracks in the seemingly-monolithic Iron Guard."
romania.73.a:0 "Cursed non-conformists."
romania.73.b:0 "Perhaps we should send this man King's regards."

#Stelescu's Ambition
romania.75.t:0 "Rise of the White Eagles"
romania.75.d:0 "Mihai Stelescu had only risen to prominence some years ago, but the young, shining star of the Legion had quickly gathered his own cult following among the movement. It is not clear whether it is from envy, ambition or idealism, but the young man and his followers have broken off from the main Legionary Movement in a very high-profile event. Stelescu has announced his plans of founding a movement of his own he calls Vulturii Albi, the White Eagles.\nStelescu's splinter movement, while still very nationalist and radical, calls for social reforms such as 8-hour work day and decent minimum wages. These ideas have brought many to question the group's true colors, and many prominent Legionnaires are openly accusing Stelescu for being a lapdog for international Jewish-Socialist conspiracy. The White Eagles in turn have criticized the main movement harshly of betraying the working class Romanians.\nStelescu's splinter movement is already being branded apostates by many prominent Legionnaires, and the Captain needs to decide soon how to deal with the crisis within the movement."

romania.76.d:0 "Mihai Stelescu, an apostate to the Legion, was ambushed and killed by the Decemviri, a Legionnaire death squad. The traitor's body was found mutilated and riddled with over 100 bullets. Many of those who had dared to follow Stelescu's movement were murdered or forced to run.\nEven though men of the death squad were promptly imprisoned, it is clear who stands victorious. The Captain awarded the assassins with the White Cross quickly after the event."
romania.76.a:0 "We must get to the bottom of this"
#Investigation to Carol
romania.77.t:0 "Investigation leads to King Carol"
romania.77.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, investigation on the Stelescu Affair has led to one man: King Carol himself. The Legion now has solid proof that the king tried to sow dissent within the Legion by encouraging and directly supporting Stelescu's apostasy, giving them ample reason to finally move against Carol once and for all. Regardless, the king's reputation is tarnished after being caught red-handed."

#Carol's Fate
romania.78.t:0 "Fate of the King"
romania.78.d:0 "After the humiliation from the Stelescu Affair, the Legion and their supporters began actively calling for the abdication of the king. As crowds gathered in front of the Royal Palace to demonstrate, Codreanu ordered Carol's arrest. Neither King Carol nor his guards resisted as the Iron Guard took over the palace. It is now time to decide the king's fate.\n\nOn one hand, the king's weakened position could be advantageous. Keeping him under house arrest after transferring his powers to Codreanu would ensure that he would only have to deal with a feeble, familiar threat that he can easily be rid of should the need arise. Otherwise, Carol should be forced to abdicate, leaving his place to the young Crown Prince Michael. Queen Helen, the mother of Michael snubbed by Carol, is particularly supportive of the second option, which could help us form a better relationship with the royal family."
romania.78.a:0 "Put him in house arrest."

romania.79.d:0 "After Carol II, the Romanian kingship passes to his son, Mihai. In a ceremony at the Patriarchal Cathedral in Bucharest, the young King was crowned with the Steel Crown and anointed by the Patriarch of the Romanian Orthodox Church.

#Royalist Officer's Coup
romania.80.t:0 "Military Launches a Coup"
romania.80.d1:0 "Despite being under house arrest, King Carol has managed to maintain contact with royalist elements throughout the country. Seeing an opportunity to strike, army officers loyal to the king launched a military coup against the government. Despite having remained neutral throughout the conflict between Carol and Codreanu, it appears that with Codreanu having tipped the balance too far in his favour, the rest of the army now has to decide whether to support the king and their fellow officers or the Prime Minister and the Iron Guard."
romania.80.d2:0 "After Codreanu called publicly for his abdication, King Carol made it clear he had no idea of stepping down. Seeing an opportunity to strike, army officers loyal to the king launched a military coup against the government.

romania.81.d:0 "As the dust settles and the army secures control of Bucharest, having arrested Codreanu and a number of his lieutenants, the king is escorted out of the Royal Palace. General Paul Teodorescu addresses the gathered crowd and soldiers in front of the palace, declaring Codreanu's government deposed and the restoration of the king's prerogatives. The declaration is followed by a speech by Carol, announcing the beginning of Romania's Renaissance along with a new government to replace Codreanu's. Royalists celebrate their victory while the scattered Iron Guard attempt to resist the coup from the countryside."

#King's Revenge
romania.82.t:0 "Wrath of the King Scorned"
romania.82.d:0 "As the scattered, headless Iron Guard struggles to fight back, Royalist forces begin to mop up their remnants. King Carol, feeling his rule secure, ponders about the fate of the high-ranking Legionaries that were arrested during the coup. His Majesty himself is quite convinced that they should be shot as soon as possible, and plenty of members of his Camarilla are in agreement, but others are considering the propaganda value of sparing their lives, keeping them jailed instead. On one hand, purging them once and for all would ensure that they will no longer plot against Him and His wrath will be known throughout Romania. On the other, appealing to the king's kindness will secure a good image for Carol and ensure that moderate politicians will more eagerly serve him once more."

##Carol's desperate coup fails, he abdictates
 romania.83.t:0 "The King's Flight"
 romania.83.d1:0 "With the Royalist coup collapsing, King Carol officially abdicated as King of Romania. During the confusion, the former King and his entourage fled the city to avoid reprisals, likely off to exile in Algeria or Portugal. While the Iron Guard has been unable to catch him, he will finally no longer be a threat to our rule."
 romania.83.d2:0 "After King Carol's formal abdication he announced his plans of travelling away from Romania, likely off to exile in Algeria or Portugal. Even though he is not legally obliged to flee, Codreanu and his lackeys would not like having the king around and have for all intents and purposes pressured Carol to escape, leaving the country in his son's hands."

What was once a stiff, yet subdued, rivalry between two prominent leaders has become a complete mess of open fighting between paramilitaries, countless assassination attempts, and outright terrorism. The young King Mihai has finally decided to intervene directly, a surprise as it has been assumed that he would remain a sideline figurehead. His advisors, however, are divided on what course of action to take. Mihai could either dismiss the government after their abject failure to keep the situation under control, or put his weight behind the Legion and help them retake control."

To rectify this, they have approached the Peasants' Party (PT) of Ion Mihalache not only to form a coalition against the Legionaries and National Liberals, but to unify the two parties altogether.\n\nAfter long negotiations, the PNR and the PT have agreed to merge into a single party, the National Peasants Party (PNT), creating a formidable political bloc that could prevent the return of either the Legion or the National Liberals. The leadership of the PNT are now deciding on who will lead the unified party.\n\nVirgil Madgearu has been the Peasants' Party's main ideologue for most of its existence and has been an outspoken critic of both National Liberal and Legionary political monopolies. Representing the left-wing, his platform is centered around the \"Community of Producers\", supporting cooperative farming and the dominance of labour over capital.\n\nIuliu Maniu was one of the leaders of the PNR and is seen as leading the centre of the new party with a platform focusing on class collaboration and corporatism.\n\nAlexandru Vaida-Voevod was the other big name of the PNR and maintains a more conservative approach with the party's right-wing. His platform is economically-driven, focusing on regional development and national stability.\n\nThe three leaders, at their core, support a more decentralized approach compared to the centralism of the National Liberals and the Legion, mixed economic policies, and parliamentary democracy."

However, in order to avoid controversy, as the PNL has long been accused of being monopolized by the Bratianu family, they have been largely relegated to minor positions despite their unwavering support of the party. While Dinu is largely remaining quiet over the issue, Gheorghe has become increasingly agitated over it and has been rallying other dissidents within the party behind him.

During the Weltkrieg, he proved highly competent, securing several victories during the defence of Romania from the invading Central Powers. Ambitious and bitter at the Treaty of Bucharest, he was one of the principal voices lionizing the Romanian Army's conduct during the war and eagerly claiming that the country's politicians had stabbed them in the back by signing the treaty. While the main signatory of the treaty, Alexandru Marghiloman, would become quickly ostracized by the Nation, Averescu would be showered with praise, becoming Marshal of Romania in 1927. Regardless, Averescu was never able to capitalize on the unstable political situation in the country and would largely remain in the sidelines while Codreanu's Legion would rise to power, which he quietly supported during his own feud with the king.\n\nA state funeral with full military honours will be organized for him as the Romanian nation mourns one of its heroes that brightly shone during its darkest times."

A career officer, his outstanding service life began as a cadet in 1868, rising through the ranks as a skilled staff officer (something extremely valuable at the time) before further studying at the prestigious military academy at Saint-Cyr. He would become highly-distinguished during the Second Balkan War as a Brigadier General and he would be quickly promoted afterwards. By the time Romania declared war on the Central Powers, Prezan commanded the First Army, securing Romania's few offensive victories of the war. This success saw him further promoted to Chief of Staff after the fall of Bucharest, where he would organize Romania's successful defense of Moldavia from General Mackensen's combined Central Powers force. With the signing of the Treaty of Bucharest, Prezan opted to retire, remaining aloof from the unstable post-war situation. Nevertheless, his superb abilities were recognized despite the defeat and he would be honoured with a marshal's baton in 1930 while his advice was highly-sought, remaining a quiet privy councillor to the king.\n\nThe venerable marshal will receive a proper state funeral with full military honours expected of Romania's heroes.

After some notable wrangling in the legislature involving heated debates between the Cabinet and the Monarch, be it on regular meetings or during presided sessions of Parliament, the King has managed to obtain approval for some massive investments in Bucharest, especially regarding the continuation of the New Royal Palace project, in exchange for refurbishing rural roads, bridges and dikes throughout Oltenia and Muntenia.\n\nNot only will these investments provide valuable jobs to the economy especially in times like these, but they will also leave behind an immortalized legacy, be it through the memory of rural infrastructural repair or through the magnificence of the new Royal Palace. With the remaining barriers out of the way, construction will begin in earnest, starting with the clearing of the ruins of the Old Royal Palace, also known as the Golescu Mansion, from their spot on Calea Victoriei."

The new structure will be the official residence of the Romanian monarchy, altough the Royal family themselves have also had a smaller villa built on the premises, known as the "New House", in order to have some privacy every once in a while."

Orthodox clerics on both sides of the Carpathians have expressed their appreciation towards this increase of status, bringing up the status of Bulgaria and that of Serbia as an example for why Romania should finally have its own patriarchy. Supportive voices from other denominations have also risen, most proeminently that of Greek Catholic Bishop of Cluj-Gherla Iuliu Hossu.\n\nNow the last remaining issue is to choose the first Patriarch of an United Romania, and three candidates have reached a particular level of notability. The first is incumbent Metropolitan-Primate of Ungrovlahia Vartolomeu Stanescu, altough he hasn't expressed much of a preference in the matter, saying that it is up to God whether he is chosen or not, and that if he isn't he would retreat to a monastery to live out his last days in peace, his metropolitanate having been very taxing. Another candidate is Nicodim Munteanu, Metropolitan of Moldova, whose firm stance on syndicalism has earned him many sympathies in the country. Finally, as a show of unity, we could elect the incumbent Metropolitan of Transylvania, Nicolae Balan, who has shown himself to be a very careful teacher to his flock and grew very respected, in addition to being very interested in the education of Transylvanian Romanians and national unity.

Written in a relatively curt, diary-like style spiced with various speeches, article quotations, letters and Bible passages, it proved to be very popular once published, with its first edition selling out in a few weeks (the 2500 free examples distributed to members who could not affort it notwithstanding), and demand for a new one gradually going up.\n\nThe Prime Minister himself was surprised by the speed with which his volume flew off the shelves, and was said to have entered talks to have new editions published, with more ambitious voices claiming it will also be translated into foreign languages soon enough."

The second section will encompass Volumes 3 and 4, concerning themselves with the national economy and transports, circulation and commerce respectively, whereas the third section encompassing volumes 5 and 6 will focus itself on national culture and cultural institutions and personalities of note respectively.\n\nAn project long in the making, aided along by collaborators across the Carpathians and fortuitously finished after the Unification, it stands as a testament to the dedication of Professor Giusti to his craft and to his country.

romania.161.d:0 "University lecturer and rising star in the world of literary criticism George Calinescu has recently chosen to experiment with a more conventional literary form; the novel, and recently his efforts have come to fruition through the publication of his work, Enigma Otiliei.\n\nDescribed as a Balzacian novel, it it set in antebellum Romania, telling the tale of young medicine student Felix Sima, who moves in with his rich yet miserly uncle Costache Giurgiuveanu. There he meets Otilia Marculescu, the man's stepdaughter, alongside his uncle's sister's family, the Tulea's- and family friend Leonida Pascalopol. Felix gradually falls in love with Otilia, who unfortunately doesn't fully return his feelings, showing some preference for Pascalopol instead. All the while, in spite of loving his stepdaughter in his own way, Giurgiuveanu is reticent to fully adopt her and make her a main beneficiary of his inheritance, resulting in a conflict where he has to deal with the Tulea family and their quest to seize control of his fortune, be it via inheritance or other means. After a surprising trip to Paris on Otilia's behalf, an affair with a courtesan on Felix's end, and the Tulea schemes to seize Costache's fortune, the two youths meet each other again, but in spite of tension do not take the final leap. Eventually, a Tulea kinsman manages to steal Giurgiuveanu's wealth, who dies from a shock-induced heart attack, and Otilia ends up marrying Pascalopol and leaving for Paris again. After the war, Felix meets Pascalopol again, who reveals that he and Otilia got divorced, the latter remarrying and moving to Buenos Aires, becoming unrecognizable to her former admirer.\n\nPortraying a modernist outlook into antebellum Bucharest bourgeoisie, coupled with themes of paternity, coming of age, and unrequited love it is selling surprisingly well. Reviews are positive, and critics foresee a brilliant career for Mr. Calinescu."

Though the flame of nationalism is still ablaze, it appears that the desire for expansionism has been finally sated.

With the German economic crisis, even more of the treaty's provisions started to be skirted or openly ignored, and now, with the outbreak of the Second Weltkrieg, the powers that be have seen it fit to finally proclaim the end of the humiliating treaty. Taking advantage of the Germans' distraction, the President of the Council of Ministers [GetHeadOfGovernment] have formally declared that the Treaty is null and void, and that should the Germans want to review their relationship with Romania, they will have to negotiate with the Romanians on equal terms.\n\nThe once-sidelined and now dismissed German ministerial officials are leaving the country in droves as Romania is establishing proper control over its river ports and the Mouths of the Danube, having also seized control of the Danube Commission's activities on its territory."

Codreanu's highly personalistic, circulary-focused and one-on-one contact-oriented leadership style has begun to falter, in spite of attempts to temper the growing zeal of his recruits. Tightening ranks, enforcing waits and probation periods between joining the Party and the Legion proper, a lot was attempted to try and temper the ballooning Iron Guard's growth and efervescency. \n\nYet, it was not enough. Many radicals across the various factions of the movement have begun to grow discontented with the "parliamentarization" of the movement, and began to yearn for the earlier days of the Guard, when it was more militant and combative. The decline of revanchism also began to hit the Legionaries' odds by reducing the wellsprings they could tap into for support. Recent setbacks have weakened movement's unity even further and the factions that used to work together have begun to openly rally against each other. These factors, and more, have led to its own control over its own members beginning to fray at the edges, and now, it is beginning to snap.\n\nMany have begun to leave, others began to form splinter groups, and in general the once-mighty behemoth of the Iron Guard has begun to collapse under its own weight. While still a force to be reckoned with, at least in the near future, it will not reach the same prominency it once had, and it is theorized it will begin falling into the same downward spiral its predecessor, the LANC, once fell in."

Containing a collection of Mota's most important articles on varying issues, from the origins of the Legion among nationalist studentry to the necessity of Greater Hungary's dismantlement, all the way to the mundane like miracles attributed to the Archangel Michael. Acting as a microcosm of Legionary beliefs, especially of its "old guard" agraro-mysticist side, the book has become very popular among Legionary circles, strengthening the reach of the so-called "Old Guard"."

Building upon his speeches of past student congresses like Romanul de maine (The Romanian of Tomorrow), he also compares the varying ideological systems of Totalism, Kemalism, Savinkovism, the Volkish movement and Italian Legionarism, as well as discussing Dostoyevsky, Berdyaev, Barrès and Jaurès. While he does acknowledge some similarities between the goals of Syndicalism and the Legionary Movement (namely, rejecting the nineteenth century's liberal tradition, abolishing social injustice, bank feudalism, privileges and capital speculations), he also sharply differentiates the movement from the Syndicalists in that they are considered worshippers of Marx, Proudhon and Pouget, builders of a second Tower of Babel who try to replace Christianity with atheism. Cantacuzino also considers that the Syndicalists are inhumane, annihilating the individual's personality and considering him as a means to an end, while Legionarism instead cares for their fellow peers and their physical and spiritual health, while also nurturing them and preparing the nation to "stand at the borders of Romanianism, ready to defend and elevate the creations of the Romanian genius to the death", an "internal revolution" against a "mechanical society".\n\nThe volume has proven to be a success among the Movement, giving further influence and intellectual backing to its radical caucus, with its emphasis on palingenetic rhetoric in the detriment of the mysticist element having further solidified Cantacuzino's standing as a Legionary theorist, and widened the intellectual horizon of the movement."

While he can reign in the Legionaries that are close to him, those further from the central reach may be more vulnerable to subversion and may get unsavoury ideas, to say nothing of the fact these new doctrinary evolutions jeopardise the ideals of the original founders' struggle.

You want someone to take away the bitter chalice, just as our Lord prayed in the Gospels."\n\n"Yes; and that someone must be you. You have been my right hand all along, fought and suffered with me and the movement through thick and thin. I have noticed that your writings and those inspired by our Vacaresti days have become influential, and you have taken very well to the responsibilities of governance during my time as President of the Council of Ministers."\n\nMota paused for a second.

"I have. Having to handle both the Movement and the Country at the same time is proving taxing, and I would like to divest myself of some of the burden. I desire to retreat for a time to the Rarau Mountains and then return to leading the movement.

I have gained insight once again as to why I raised the battle cry all those years ago and why I fight today.\n\nI have also realised that factionalism, that scourge which has torn apart the country for so long, has re-emerged within our ranks. Though not as pronounced, it still has the potential to tear us apart. Well, not anymore. I hereby declare that I will not step down, though I will appoint some of you as vice-premiers to ease the burden.

Namely, that the Legion's popularity is undermining it. The more members that sign up, the more they have to be kept in check to follow Codreanu's strict standards, a task that has to be balanced with actually ruling the country. Altough attempts are made to control this phenomenon via probation periods and limiting the number of people allowed to ascend into the Legion proper from the “outer Party”, the influx is slowly fraying its Captain’s capacity of maintaining his hold.\n\nThis member influx has also proven conductive to the development of factions within the Legion’s ranks, with three “strains” of thought becoming the most relevant: the “Old Guard”, standard-bearers of the early days’ student mysticism and agrarian populism, centred on Legion co-founder Ion Mota; the “Legionary Workers’ Corps”, geared more towards urban worker interests and having a more social-revolutionary leaning and centred around LWC leader Gheorghe Clime and Transylvanian organiser Horia Sima; and finally, the radicals, who combine elements of established Legionary thought with parts of other National-Populist ideologies, especially the ANI in the Italian Republic, with this group being centred on Legionary rising star and firebrand Alexandru Cantacuzino.\n\nAs the Legion heads towards ever greater heights, it remains to be seen if one of these strands of thought will become dominant or if its Captain will once more achieve the seemingly-impossible and re-centre the movement around his leadership."

romania.203.d:0 "In spite of being preoccupied with their war in the Middle East, the Ottoman government has indeed found time to pen a letter of complaint to the Romanian government, expressing frustration over the seizure of Ada Kaleh.\n\nFortunately however, the island’s small size and distance from the Ottoman mainland, pressing concerns closer to home and the negligible benefit in holding it have swayed the Ottoman government to not pursue further action in the matter. While the Sultan was not happy over the island’s loss, the island’s days of importance are long past, and any conflict over the island was deemed as pointless.\n\nThe Romanian government has expressed relief over this reaction, and has stated its openness for a prospective détente with the Ottoman Empire in the future."

romania.204.d:0 "With the Ottoman Government’s recent announcement of a policy of reconciliation with the Balkan states, the matter of the island of Ada Kaleh has sprung to the forefront of negotiations with Romania.\n\nA small island in the Danube whose defensive importance is long past, it now functions as a de jure part of the Ottoman Empire, who in spite of still sending officials to govern it in the Sultan’s name, doesn’t appear to have much interest in the detached island anymore. However, Romania has shown interest in obtaining control over it, and has pledged itself to mantain the island’s privileges.\n\nAnd so, in a ceremony on the Island proper, a treaty was signed formally ceding the island to Romania, with residents and officials alike watching the Ottoman flag be lowered from Ada Kaleh for the last time, replaced with the Romanian tricolour. In a speech, the foreign minister of Romania has pledged to safeguard the island’s traditions, announcing that the King himself has taken interest in the island and will visit it soon enough; an event said by some islanders to be foretold in a dream."

romania.205.d:0 "The day said to be foretold in a dream has finally arrived; His Majesty the King has come to visit Ada Kaleh. Guided on a tour of the island by the island’s mayor and local entrepreneur Ali Kadri, the King and his entourage have visited the ruins of the old star fort, the local village, the mosque, the house of local figure Niyazi Suleiman, and enjoyed cups of traditionally-brewed coffee at a local cafe.\n\nListening to the islanders’ pleas, the King spoke the words ”You may return to your homes in peace. From now on, you will have back your privileges, and all my care.” and formally restored the island’s privileges of customs tax and conscription exemption. A local company owned by Ali Kadri was granted a license to import luxury goods including tobacco, coffee, sugar, alcohol and cigarettes, with the tobacco and cigarette license being especially significant owing to the existence of the state monopoly on tobacco. An arrangement was also codified into Romanian law where half the company’s profits were assigned for the upkeep and modernisation of the island, with the other half divided out equally as a small subsidy to every one of its residents. Upon hearing the news, the residents rejoiced, with the date of the King’s visit becoming enshrined as a local holiday."

There, a religious ceremony was held, after which the royal entourage headed towards the Royal Palace, where, after being congratulated by various diplomats and holding a speech, Nicolae put the Steel Crown on his own head, before crowning his wife with the Crown of Queen Elisabeta. The following days are scheduled to host military reviews and parades by representants of the counties of Romania, with the festivities slated to culminate with another coronation at Alba Iulia.\n\nAlongside the King, many high-ranking members of the Legionary Movement could be seen, many of whom had a veneer of satisfaction as they watched the ceremony unfold.

romania.207.d:0 "Before the Unification was achieved, the Transylvanian chapters of the Legionary Movement were generally grouped under regional organisers, ultimately answering to Ion Mota, who then reported back to the Captain himself.\n\nNow however, with the Union having finally been accomplished, the Transylvanian chapters are beginning to clamour for reorganisation, to better integrate them within the structure of the Movement at large. As Codreanu is for now focused more on the Old Kingdom, whomsoever gets control over the vast and growing Transylvanian chapters will become very influential within the Movement as a whole. A host of CML-aligned members of the Committee of the Thousand have proposed granting Horia Sima, a regional organiser in the Banat area who has made overtures to the group in the past, control over the Transylvanian chapters, citing his experience in organising the West. The Legionary Senate however, more influenced by the Old Guard, has proposed continuing Mota’s tenure, citing his incumbency and his vital role in setting up the Transylvanian organisations. Of course, the Captain could also try to satisfy both and grant Mota control over the inner Transylvanian chapters and Sima control over the West, reducing the chances of an unified Transylvanian bloc emerging and safeguarding his own influence in the process."

romania.208.d:0 "Safeguarding Mota’s tenure over the Transylvanian chapters of the Legionary Movement, while a successful move in terms of binding the chapters across the Carpathians, has also given the so-called “Old Fighter” caucus a great deal of influence. Due to having almost free reign in spreading their view of Legionary ideology across the Carpathians, the share of Legionary members adhering to the Old Guard’s tenets of agrarian populism tinged with heavily Orthodox mysticism-inspired rhetoric has dramatically grown. While Mota is loyal to his brother-in-law, he and other members of this caucus have become emboldened, and their likeliness to talk back to Codreanu over decisions he wants to make has grown accordingly"

romania.209.t:0 "The Workers Rally"
romania.209.d:0 "With Sima in charge of the Transylvanian chapters, it seems his courting of the Legionary Worker Corps has borne fruit, for their influence beyond the Carpathians has dramatically begun to increase. Canteens and legionary shops are being set up in industrial towns, giving the CML ideal opportunities to begin swaying factory workers to their cause, activities that they basically have free reign on. While the other groups still have adherents beyond the mountains, many urban centres of Transylvania seem poised to become LWC strongholds. While their loyalty to the Captain is still secure, it remains to be seen how this situation will develop, especially considering that the new members seem very driven towards revolutionary strands of thought..."
romania.209.a:0 "Most worrisome."

romania.210.t:0 "Question of the Intelligence Service"
romania.210.d:0 "The Legionary Movement, already atypical amongst organisations of its kind, also took the daring step of creating its own internal intelligence service, the SIMLR – Serviciul de Informatii al Miscarii Legionare din Romania; the Informations Service of the Legionary Movement of Romania-. While a relatively small organisation and nowhere near as efficient as the state intelligence service, it nevertheless helps ensure internal cohesion among the movement’s ranks. With the expansion of Legionary power and influence however, many members, especially those affiliated with the radical caucus, want to expand its capacities, turning it into a full-fledged auxiliary of the SSI – Serviciul Special de Informatii; the Special Informations Service-, to be led by Horia Cosmovici, protege of Sima and Cantacuzino. Other voices within the movement, including the SIMLR’s current leader, Ion Belgea, clamour that tangling with the SSI would only result in bureaucratic tanglings and would hamper its efficiency, and that if the SSI were to be roused, it could undermine us from its very lofty position."

romania.211.t:0 "An Auxiliary Police Force?"
romania.211.d:0 "Altough the Movement reigns supreme in Romania at this moment, concerns have been raised over just how loyal the Police could be within the new State. In spite of the Movement’s control of the Ministry of the Interior, the Police proper still has not had the best of relationships with the Legionaries, as immortalised in the killing of police prefect Manciu back in the early 1920’s.\n\nAn unlikely solution has emerged, especially pushed by the Movement’s radicals, aided along by LWC sympathisers: create a special auxiliary police force, recruited from amongst Movement members, which is to collaborate with the regular police force in a variety of matters. Supporters consider that this will further strengthen the Movement’s power and will be of use towards achieving the Legionary Victory, while opponents consider that its very vaguely-defined capacities and powers will only lead to abuses, and to the Romanian people losing faith in the Legion as its national and spiritual guiding force, claiming that arresting people on a whim is not what the Captain would desire. What should be done in this debate?"
romania.211.a:0 "Establish the Legionary Police, and appoint General Petrovicescu to lead it!"
romania.211.b:0 "We risk becoming that which we fought against; focus on reforming the regular police instead."

romania.212.t:0 "A Crumbling House of Cards"
romania.212.d:0 "Back in the 1920’s, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and a bunch of followers split from the National-Christian Defence League, led by A.C Cuza, to form his new political movement, which would grow into the Legionary Movement. However, now it seems that his own turn as face of the Romanian ultranationalist right may be ending in fire just as A.C Cuza’s did.\n\nFew could predict that the seemingly-ascendant Legion of the Archangel Michael would begin to share its forebear’s fate, but the signs have grown ever clearer over the past months. Its growing size began to work against it, as the Legion began to host different caucuses and factions within itself, arguing over precise points of Legionary doctrine and interpreting various points in their own manner. While its Captain could keep control for a time, he still had moments where it seemed he could lose control over his movement’s future. And now, he sees his control unravel in a crisis worse than he had ever seen before, as the infighting within the Legionary Movement is beginning to reach a fever pitch, with internal disputes wreaking havoc within the organisation’s stability and more and more members beginning to split apart from it.\n\nWhether this was caused by his own failings or by a specific stream of thought becoming too dominant is unclear, but one thing is certain; it would take a great effort to try and correct the course now. Codreanu’s own advisors have begun to hint that he should take a step back and embrace a more spiritual role in the Legion’s leadership and leave one of his trusted subordinates as political head, but some voices still consider that the Captain will be able to call upon divine providence this time as well and bring the chaos to an end. With the pressure and stress mounting upon Codreanu, already troubled by this turn of events, it remains to be seen what he will do to restore cohesion."
romania.212.a:0 "Perhaps Mota's Old Guard can help us."

Some of the more radical wing calls for him to take total control over the country and disassemble entire rotten structure, but there's great many of those who would want to stay in the path the Captain has prepared for us.\n\nWe are in a position to take absolute control, should we desire so - but it would mean breaking apart much of what Codreanu had built before his resignation from the government. On the other hand, no great nation was built without demolishing old structures and building them anew."

romania.216.d:0 "Even though the death of the so-called Captain did throw the Legionaries into disarray for some time, it seems they were more resilient than expected, with many of them regrouping into so-called “Persecution Commanderies” under various leaders.\n\nWhat especially makes these developments concerning is that without their leader’s command, the restraints he imposed on their behaviour have come loose; violence from their ranks is rising, and the Special Informations Service reports that there are whispers of an assassination plot. One bigger than most. Naturally, we have reasons to suspect it targets the King.\n\nAn emergency meeting of the Crown Council was called, and various solutions were proposed to this end. One idea is to cut down on Royal appearances outside the Palace and increase the Royal Guard detail when outside of its confines, altough this may be seen by some elements of the people as a sign of cowardice. Another one, related to the previous one would be to temporarily delegate the King’s duties to the Council of Ministers, with the ministers taking up some of the visits and protocolary journeys the King has to do, albeit the risk with this idea is that the angered Legionaries would try gunning down one of them instead. Finally, Royal confidant and Bucharest Police Prefect Gabriel Marinescu, known critic of the Legionaries, suggests to place their trust in the Police, increasing their presence should the King be about and vastly increasing their competencies. Critics of this plan point that the Police may not necessarily be prepared to handle this issue, and the Legionaries have prior experience with dealing with Police members anyway. How should we proceed?"

While there was a certain Legionary presence on any Royal appearance, identifiable in spite of the lack of their well-known green shirt, the vast security detail managed to stop most of them from any rash action.\n\nMost, as there were groups that did try, however their members got repelled by the Royal Guards, with more than a few having died in the process. Even though the Legionaries have already started to honour them as martyrs, the chances they will try anything against the King’s person are only getting lower and lower."

The assassins were driven off, but Calinescu, Andone and the driver were wounded, and will need time to recover.\n\nWhile the victims were injured, we are confident they will survive. The Legion’s ambitions have been dampened on this day, as the attempted assassination of a Royal minister will certainly be enough impetus to intensify the offensive against them."

The minister’s bodyguard, Radu Andone, opened the door just enough to get shot in the shoulder, alerting him to the attackers’ presence in the worst way possible. The driver was sent off to alert the nearby motorcade, time in which both Calinescu and Andone were hard-pressed, Andone especially trying to repel the assasins by rolling down his window just enough to allow himself to fire his pistol while staying under cover. The reinforced glass, however, eventually gave way, resulting in the bodyguard and Prime Minister Calinescu being wounded by the time the motorcade and the policemen arrived at the scene and drove the assasins away.\n\nWhile the victims were injured, we are confident they will survive.

And God only knew what would happen with him out of the picture.\n\nMaybe he would go to the planes today. Maybe he could talk some of them to allow him to attend to his flying lessons. Who knows, one day he could learn how to pilot himself. Give himself a suitable outlet for his anger at his situation, and maybe get an idea on how to act.

While not capable of rousing as many people as it could in its prime, it still has a fair few nostalgics, and the capacity to perpetuate itself. Romanian politics may be slowly easing themselves into a new more democratic norm, but the silent gaze of the Archangel's men will still be ever-present in the shadows, still adhering to the tenets of their Captain and his Commanders of the Annunciation."

romania.226.t:0 "A New Constitution!"
romania.226.d:0 "Celebrations sweep Parliament and the Green House as the Legionary Movement rejoices over the new constitution it plans to give to the country. Higher-ranked cadres are confident that the project will be approved by referendum, and usher in a new era for the Romanian nation.\n\nDrawing some inspiration from poporanist movements of ages past, the new Constitution firmly reinforces the guiding role of the Romanian people within the Romanian nation, as well as enshrining the fundamental value of property and land; albeit also establishing the State as a powerful power-broker in such matters by giving it a fair amount of power to seize, sell and distribute land. Parliament is also reorganised to include representatives of all worker, peasant, entrepreneur and professional associations, centreing them on the Senate in addition to the senators by-right; the Deputies are elected still by party lists. The dominant role of the Orthodox and Uniate confessions is enshrined, while the centralistic principle of administration is tempered ever so slightly.\n\nAs the dominant party, the Legion is uniquely placed to position itself within the framework of this new system, creating an unique system blending some of the trappings of the old with the new. Few know what to expect of this new system, but the throngs of green-shirts certainly appear supportive of the project, seeing it as the capstone to their so-called "Great Legionary Victory"."

romania.227.t:0 "A New Constitution!"
romania.227.d:0 "Following the PNT's period of consolidation and governance, the time has come to finally revise the old Constitution of 1866, a deed which was carried out. After approval by the Legislating Chambers and the Sovereign, it is expected that the people will also approve it via referendum.\n\nInfluenced both by the old constitution and the views of theorists like Constantin Stere and Romul Boilă, the new constitution devotes vast space to defining and protecting individual rights, influenced by the British concept of habeas corpus. Centralisation, though still upheld, is tempered through local autonomy on the lowest levels, and the role of popular initiatives and referenda is increased. Not all provisions survived the discussion process however; the Superior Economic Council, the Unicameral Parliament and the idea of placing land use and repartition under State control did not make the revision.\n\nIts spirit however remained unscathed, and the frontment of the PNT are sure that their new constitution will be a major step forward towards a brighter future for Romania, as the nation moves forward as one."
romania.227.a:0 "Hurrah for the new constitution of All Romanians!"

romania.228.t:0 "A New Constitution!"
romania.228.d:0 "Under the PNL's wise stewardship, a new constitution was drafted and approved. Honouring the dreams of the late Ionel Brătianu and King Ferdinand, the new constitution enshrines the new democratic system, as well as codifying the new developments of the years since the last constitutional adoption. It will be submitted to a referendum, which it will most likely pass.\n\nMany provisos of the old have been kept but modernised: the King still mantains extensive prerogatives like vetoing laws, issuing pardons and vetos, appointing and dismissing ministers, but he can exercise it only with the agreement of his ministers. For he reigns, but does not govern.\n\nRights previously enshrined were still codified, the status of the Romanian Orthodox and Greek-Catholic Churches as dominant faiths was enshrined, and, above all, the national and indivisible character of the Nation was solidified, further cementing the Great Union of all Romanians under one nation."
romania.228.a:0 "At last, a new constitution!"

romania.229.t:0 "On the Ground and In the Papers"
romania.229.d:0 ""Have you heard? The Legionaries, they were toppled!"\n\n"Eh, 'twas to be expected. Of course those damn Masons wouldn't let Codreanu clean up the mess."\n\n"You don't realise what this means, Vasile? We're getting new elections, proper ones this time! The King said he-"\n\n"The King's a little boy tangling with the messes of big men, Adrian. Brave, but let's see just what this little boy's capable of."\n\n"I for one cheer for these guys, the PNT; they seem like they know their stuff."\n\n"Pfah, that Maniu fella? Don't be silly. It'll just be the PNL all over again."\n\nThe announcement of new elections has stirred up debate in Romania's public spaces; as people from the highest intellectuals to the peasants in the fields are pondering just what will the future hold and are deciding just what party will be the next one to lead Romania forward. Cynicism still remains strong among certain segments of the populace, who may hold nostalgia for Carol II or for the Captain and his men, but the flourishing of popular dialogue gives many of the more educated citizens hope that democracy may yet take root in Romania."
romania.229.a:0 "The ballot boxes will speak soon."

romania.230.t:0 "In the Grove"
romania.230.d:0 ""Nea Ilie, Nea Ilie, hurry up, we are ready!"\n\n"Hold your horses Gheorghe, I'm coming."\n\nIt is a leisurely day in Romania, and with a lull in the day's work, many villagers find it worthwhile to gather up to hear the day's events, be it in a bar or outside in a grove. And in this particular village, the blacksmith's grove is the stage for this communal news discussion.\n\n"Let's see. Apparently Mihalache wants to easen up peasant financial burdens and promises a debt relief law if his guys make it to Parliament."\n\n"Really, Ilie? This sounds excellent!"\n\n"Hey don't hurry him Iorgu, let him read; how'd the Liberals reply?"\n\n"Răducanu says they will go for a better one if they take power."\n\n"As if those Brătianu fans will actually do something, right Nea Ilie?"\n\n"You better watch it Gheorghe, you know that I like them still, as I know just what a man Ionel Brătianu was."\n\n"Yeah, a puppet of those Germans! He surely stood up for us back then!"\n\n"Calm down Barbu, let him get back to reading!"\n\n"Oh you sure like to defend him Iorgu, but you wouldn't defend the country in its time of need!"\n\n"You didn't take the fall of the Archangel's men lightly didn't you?"\n\n"Everyone shut up and let Nea Ilie speak!" yelled Iocan the blacksmith.\n\nNea Ilie smiled as he watched everyone get along in their own unique way. It was in these heated discussions that opinions grew, exchanges were had but ultimately all was forgiven. For such was the nature of these newspaper chats; just as easily as they could lead to fiery debates, they could lead to the forgiveness of whatever bad blood ensued over a cup of wine or two later on."
romania.230.a:0 "Time certainly has its patience, and events like this colour its canvas."

romania.231.t:0 "Terrorist Attack in Alföld!"
romania.231.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, the western borderlands remain hostile and dangerous for true Romanians. In depressingly common event, group of Magyar terrorists attacked small military patrol deep in Alföld. Our men had hardly answered to the fire when the criminals fled. The patrol was left to tend to their dead and wounded as the hunt for the attackers started, but it was clear for everyone that it would be a fruitless effort. The various separatist organisations of the Alföld region had nearly full support of the locals, and were sheltered and supported by the Hungarian farmers. The only thing we could do is to increase security and keep the cities under increasingly tight grasp."
romania.231.a:0 "Send in more troops!"
romania.231.b:0 "They will learn to love the whip, in time."

romania.232.t:0 "Defiance in Alföld"
romania.232.d:0 "In spite of our best attempts to enforce a curfew and curtail resistance activies in Alföld these past few weeks, many woke up this morning to see the Hungarian Flag flown defiantly above several state buildings in Debrecen. It is not known how the perpetrators were able to coordinate such an act of subterfuge, but it is likely they were assisted by sympathetic officials in the local government here. Although they were taken down with haste, the damage was already done. Several outlets had taken photos of the buildings, the news spreading like wildfire in Hungarian newspapers across the border. While nobody was hurt, this act is likely to only embolden the resistance cells here."
romania.232.a:0 "Get those blasted flags down, now!"

romania.233.t:0 "Officer shot in Alföld"
romania.233.d:0 "Residents of Békéscsaba were startled today to hear the sound of several gunshots ring out during the mid day. A masked assailant having shot and killed one of our officers who was drinking at a pub in the city centre. The attempts of the Military Police in the area to pursue after him were thwarted by a rather uncooperative crowd and he was ultimately able to escape. Follow up investigations from witnesses also proved to be unfruitful as many Hungarians outright refused to provide a testimony to the Gendarmerie. It is likely we will never find the perpetrator, having most likely smuggled himself over the Hungarian border, beyond our grasp."
romania.233.a:0 "Double the size of the City Garrison. Make sure this never happens again!"

romania.234.t:0 "Barracks Looted!"
romania.234.d:0 "Reports are coming in that one of our Barracks in Orosháza was looted late last night. A group of rebels were able to attack the base, overpowering the guards stationed there before looting the barracks. All together we lost 17 men once a body count was conducted after the fighters slipped back into the night. Thousands of rifles, hundreds of machine guns and two dozen crates of grenades are now unaccounted for, likely already having been proliferated between several underground cells in the province. If this equipment is allowed to remain out there, it will only lead to more issues in the future for us dealing with the rebels. What should we do?"
romania.234.a:0 "Search all the properties in the area. Find those weapons!"

romania.240.t:0 "Great Game Cut Short"
romania.240.d:0 "Codreanu's revanchist gambit has failed and brought a national catastrophe. Bulgarians have triumphed over us yet again and enforced a humiliating peace treaty. No amount of beaten up 'traitors' could save the situation for the Captain, as the calls for his removal grow louder and louder. Not even his own flock is behind him, as many of his rivals are already smelling blood.\n\nThe King would be rejoicing if he was not stuck in the same accusations as his government is. After all, the war with Bulgaria was one of the few things he agreed on with Codreanu. The liberal opposition, reinvigorated by the total failure of both would-be-dictators, is calling for Carol II's second abdication - this time for ever. Having lost the will to resist these calls, Carol II officially abdicated few days later.\n\nIn the surprise new chance for Romanian democracy, Constantin Brătianu and his National Liberals have once more formed a government with cooperation with young king Mihai I. Together they swear to rebuild the battered Romanian democracy - and if God wills it, build a society without Codreanus and Carol II."
romania.240.a:0 "Good luck, King Mihai."

romania.241.t: "Split Among the Bessarabian Politicians"
romania.241.d: "The recent formation of a coalition between the Peasant Party and the Romanian National Party also led to a series of heated debates among the Bessarabian minority of politicians, mainly between Pan Halippa and Ion Inculets. In 1921, most of the Bessarabian Peasant Party (PTB) joined the all-Romanian Peasant Party (PT), and although the affiliated members retained some autonomy, they largely had no voice.\n\nThe Inculets faction, which disagreed with the current merger, has announced its withdrawal from the PNT and announced the creation of its own party, the Partidul Taranesc Liberal (Liberal Peasant Party), as well as a coalition with the National Liberals.\n\nHowever, the withdrawal of the Inculets faction from the PTB could significantly affect the party's ability to win the next elections, at least in Bessarabia, since the split among Bessarabian politicians, which has long matured and has finally reached its climax, has left only a minority of popular Bessarabian politicians in the PTB."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_MICHAEL_I_DESC:0 "Born to Crown Prince Carol and Princess Helen of Greece in 1921, the young Prince Michael was marked by his family's tumultuous life and his country's malaise after the loss in the Weltkrieg. He has seen much over his relatively short life, and now he finally takes the throne after the fierce power struggle between his father the King and the then-Prime Minister, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.\n\nA far more reserved individual than his bombastic father, Michael's profound Anglophilia and appreciation towards the British monarchy drove him to begin renewing the dramatically-weakened democratic process in his country, seeing it as the way to truly heal the grievous wounds opened in the wake of the defeat in the Great War and that the national unification has started to patch up. It may be a heavy burden for his young shoulders, but the King feels that with proper guidance, both he and his country will overcome all adversities and go forward as one."
POLITICS_MICHAEL_I_2_DESC:0 "Born to Crown Prince Carol and Princess Helen of Greece in 1921, the young Prince Michael was marked by his family's tumultuous life and his country's malaise after the loss in the Weltkrieg. He has seen much over his relatively short life, and now he finally takes the throne after the fierce power struggle between his father the King and the then-Prime Minister, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu.\n\nIn spite of his bigger appreciatiion of democracy compared to his ambitious father, the Legionary dominance of his government forces him to lay low. Though he would like to eventually restore the rule of democracy in his home country and fulfill the dream of his grandfather Ferdinand, the Green Hydra's stranglehold over his country is too formidable at the present date to dislodge. While they haven't moved against him, the greenshirts have learned from their mistakes with King Carol, and now the Archangel's men keep a watchful eye over Michael's own undertakings. Though he finds relief in his interests of cars and planes, the young King faces a certain fright that if he does anything wrong he'll face the wrath of the Greenshirts, forcing him to at least silently acquiesce to their projects for now. Yet the young King hopes that some day he'll have his chance to finally uproot the Legion from its roost, restore democracy and mend his nation's wounds."
POLITICS_CAROL_II_DESC:0 "Back when he was just the Crown Prince, Carol II of Romania would've seemed like a most unfit person to take the throne of Romania, as shown by the Zizi Lambrino incident in the closing days of the Weltkrieg. His country's loss however, hit hard, and as he saw the malaise his future kingdom had fallen in, he swore to remake the country into that which it was supposed to be. An autocratic charmer par excellence, he used the small-but-rising Legionary Movement as a sledgehammer to further weaken the declining PNL and the Legionaries' old rivals, the National-Christian Defense League. Now however, the scheming King faces one last hurdle in his path towards redeeming his country; the very same Legionary Movement he once supported, and its shadowy Captain, Corneliu Zelea Codreanu. As clouds gather on the horizon of the post-Weltkrieg order, both King and Captain foresee opportunities to achieve their goal of national unification and breaking the other's power, and the King, though a flawed man, will act upon any opportunities that come his way to establish himself as his country's uncontested Sun."
POLITICS_CAROL_II_2_DESC:0 "Back when he was just the Crown Prince, Carol II of Romania would've seemed like a most unfit person to take the throne of Romania, as shown by the Zizi Lambrino incident in the closing days of the Weltkrieg. His country's loss however, hit hard, and as he saw the malaise his future kingdom had fallen in, he swore to remake the country into that which it was supposed to be. An autocratic charmer par excellence, he used the small-but-rising Legionary Movement as a sledgehammer to further weaken the declining PNL and the Legionaries' old rivals, the National-Christian Defense League, and now, he has cast them aside as well in the wake of the Stelescu incident. Now ruling uncontested over Romania, he plans to use his now-unassailable position to build Romania up into a true regional powerhouse, based on strong industry, bountiful agriculture, flourishing culture and united beneath its King's firm hand and unwavering gaze. Come what may, the united Romanian people shall be led forward to a bright future, and they will forever be indebted to their visionary monarch's guidance."
POLITICS_CANTACUZINO_DESC:0 "A scion of the ancient princely Cantacuzino family claiming descent from the Byzantine Kantakouzenos dynasty, Prince Alexandru Cantacuzino is a very atypical nobleman. A firm believer in the precepts of the Legion of the Archangel Michael, Cantacuzino made himself remarked in numerous nationalist student congresses, holding fiery speeches denouncing what he saw as blights over his country. Rapidly rising through the Legionary Movement's ranks, becoming a member of the Captain's inner circle and making himself known as a theorist and as an efficient organizer, Cantacuzino became a minister in the Captain's cabinet after their rise to power. Cutting his teeth even more in the Spanish Civil War, the Prince returned home only to become embroiled in the escalating conflict between the Captain and the King.\n\nShocked by the assasination of Codreanu, Cantacuzino joined the fight, rallying many Legionaries to the cause and helping reorganize the movement for the struggle, emerging as a front-runner for the succession of the Captain. Soon enough, the zeal of the Archangel's men won out, and now the barred cross flies true above all of Romania once more. Having asserted himself as worthy of the position, the Legionary Senate has confirmed him as the Captain's successor, and now he stands ready to implement his vision over all of Romania, as its Conducator and Regent."
POLITICS_NICOLAE_I_DESC:0 "Born in 1909, the fourth child of King Ferdinand and Queen Maria of Romania, Prince Nicolae seemed set for an easy life. Free from the responsibilities associated of the eldest son –albeit some scares like the Lambrino scandal did result in discussions on whether to begin grooming Nicolae for rulership-, the younger Prince developed a passion for sports, cars and high-society life. In spite of his mother’s protests, he fell for a woman, Ioana Dumitrescu-Doletti, daughter-in-law to liberal politician Nicolae N. Saveanu, who divorced her then-husband to be by her new beau’s side. Unlike his brother however, Nicolae married his lover outright, violating the Statute of the Royal House and creating a rift between him and his brother; a rift that would lead him to make overtures towards the Legionary Movement.\n\nAfter his brother’s abdication, Nicolae agreed to a deal between him and the ascendant Legionaries where he would take the throne if the Statute of the Royal House was modified accordingly to legitimize his marriage to Ioana. Now, as King, he continues to not show much interest in political affairs, preferring to focus on his own undertakings and hobbies instead."
POLITICS_MIHAIL_II_STURDZA_DESC:0 "Born as Prince Mihail Sturdza in 1886 into a prestigious princely family, the newly-crowned Mihai II is everything that Carol II was not: experienced, harsh, a true believer in the Legionary cause, and from a centuries-old Romanian family, unlike the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringens. He fought in the Great War, and after it became increasingly drawn towards the Legionary Movement, acting as their spokesman in high diplomatic circles.\n\nHis personal philosophy of governance is that Romania should be run like a barracks - well-organised, militarised, purposeful. Enemies of Romania - the communists and the corrupt - must be tirelessly fought. However, his main interest is in foreign policy. As a career diplomat, King Mihai II has a wide network of contacts across Europe, and has even expressed hopes of building an alliance of like-minded states in the Southern and Eastern European region."

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_HAILE_SELASSIE_DESC:0 "Following the death of Zauditu on 2 April 1930, Ras Tafari Makonnen was crowned Emperor of Ethiopia on 2 November 1930 at Addis Ababa's Cathedral of St. George. Upon climbing the throne the new Emperor, eager to wield the power he had finally obtained, started a series of sweeping political reforms to bring Abyssinia 'into the west'. In 1923 he toured Europe, inspecting schools, hospitals, factories, and churches, and the contact with the European way of life had greatly impressed him, for he intended to modernise Abyssinia to the European standard. These reforms, however, were fiercely opposed by the powerful conservative elements of the nation and have been delayed by the economic problems affecting the Empire, especially the debt he inherited from Zewditu's reign, and the pervasive and invasive German economic influence"

ETH_Debt_idea_1_desc:0 "Our debt has reached a critical level and is a crippling burden on the shoulders of the state. People have begun to call the independence of Ethiopia into question because of how much our debt has tied us down."
ETH_Debt_idea_2_desc:0 "Despite our large amount of debt, which is preventing us from undertaking large scale projects, we have managed to lessen the burden it has had on the state."
ETH_Debt_idea_3_desc:0 "Despite our vast debt, which has prevented us from enacting several measures, we have managed to substantially decrease it due to debt management efforts."
ETH_Debt_idea_4_desc:0 "Despite remaining at large, our debt is fairly manageable and no longer as limiting."
ETH_Debt_idea_5_desc:0 "The status of our debt has been reduced to that of a nuisance. However, it still interferes with and prevents us from undertaking future goals."
ETH_military_Focus_desc:0 "We've decided to focus our budget primarily on military expenditure."
ETH_production_focus_desc:0 "We've decided to focus our budget primarily on production and industrial expansion."
ETH_construction_focus_desc:0 "We've decided to focus our budget primarily on infrastructural upgrades and our construction capability."
ETH_Tribal_Intergration_desc:0 "Ever since we've begun the recognition of the rights of the various tribes and their chiefs, they've adopted a much more loyal and co-operative policy towards the state."
ETH_advisors_germany_desc:0 "Our military officers are working closely with German military advisers to help modernise and better discipline our armed forces."
ETH_Food_desc:0 "With the issue of famine now solved, our population and economy have been projected to grow in the medium term."
ETH_Scouts_desc:0 "The youth of our nation, now joining the ESA in droves, possess both noble and admirable goals and will work towards becoming valued and honoured citizens of the empire."
ETH_Slavery_idea_desc:0 "Slavery is an extremely widespread practice within Ethiopia. Despite efforts, which were mostly symbolic in nature, undertaken by former emperors following Menelik II, slavery and descendants of slaves continue to exist and, despite working hard, receive no pay for their efforts. This institution is both inefficient and a great source of shame for Ethiopia as the practice of slavery is seen as improper for any civilised nation."
ETH_Land_Reform_idea_desc:0 "We're now utilising our lands much more efficiently and managing them with modern methods. This has greatly impacted our agricultural output."
ETH_Aristocratic_Army_desc:0 "Positions held within our armed forces are determined by birth and all of the top positions are held by men who are of noble blood and, yet, as seen in the Weltkrieg, of questionable competence."
ETH_Speech_Freedom_desc:0 "We now possess laws to protect the peoples' right to and freedom of speech. Furthermore, we also possess the political will to enforce these new laws."
ETH_Ethiopian_Welfare_desc:0 "Poverty prevents our citizens from experiencing potential material gain and prosperity. We must protect even the poorest of our subjects, to ensure that each and every single one of them can possess an optimistic future."
ETH_Lion_of_Judah_idea_desc:0 "The Lion of Judah is more than just a mere dynastic symbol. It stands for all the hardships and challenges that Ethiopia, the one nation to survive colonialism and even triumph against the colonisers, has overcome. Time and time again, in our thousand year history, the empire has stood tall since the Heirs of Solomon first set foot here."
ETH_Imperial_Inspiration_desc:0 "Our Emperor is a man who, himself, is larger than life. To any foreigner, he may seem meek in personality and small in stature. However, when he speaks, all listen. He had inherited a broken and bankrupt empire from Zewditu, and everyone can see, yet only few understand, the greatness he truly stands for."
ETH_Working_Natives_desc:0 "Ever since we've begun recognising the rights of the tribes and their chiefs, they, in turn, have begun to co-operate with us."
ETH_Trained_Pilots_desc:0 "A piloting school, headed by foreign advisers, has been opened in Addis Ababa."
ETH_Anti_Imp_desc:0 "Those who would attempt to conquer us continually underestimate our. From Wofla to Adwa, envious vultures attempt to break our spirit and subjugate the free people of Ethiopia. Never shall they succeed!"
ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_idea_desc:0 "By utilising foreign expertise and basing our designs off of external blueprints, we can ensure Ethiopian-made guns, made by Ethiopians for Ethiopians, are of the highest calibre whilst remaining inexpensive."
ETH_Levy_Army_desc:0 "Ethiopia, unlike the powers of the modern era, does not possess a united and organised army. The 'army' of Ethiopia, in fact, belongs to individual lords, whose men are loyal to them and only them."

ETH_Nationalised_Railroad_desc:0 "We've now nationalised our railways, ensuring that they are Imperial property. We will take good care of them, ensuring that the transportation of goods and troops flows swiftly and efficiently."
ETH_Privatised_Railroad_desc:0 "We will allow the German-owned railways to continue operation under German personnel, however we will continually monitor them, ensuring that their quality remains of the highest calibre."
ETH_Expand_Railroad_desc:0 "Expanding the current railways system is crucial to the long term benefit of our nation. Lines of communication, the distribution of goods, and the movement of troops are all equally important and will help our nation prosper. Thankfully, the Emperor understands the importance of transportation."
ETH_Southern_Expansion_desc:0 "The next step of our railway expansion plan is to connect the southernmost regions of the empire to the rest of our infrastructure and, hopefully, the rest of the nation."
ETH_Expand_Into_Eritrea_desc:0 "The next step of our railway expansion plan is to connect the empire's only coastal region, Eritrea, to the rest of the nation, improve the prosperity of people living there, and better manage the flow of goods in the region."
ETH_Impose_Amharic_desc:0 "Despite not being ethnically homogeneous, Eritrea has a significant amount of Tigray elite, which could, potentially, pose a threat to us in the future. We should take steps to ensure that the language barrier does not give them any sort of advantage and drive home the concept that Eritrea is Ethiopia."
ETH_Tribe_Intergration_desc:0 "We can sway the Eritrean leadership to our side... if we offer them substantial incentives."
ETH_Officer_Intergration_desc:0 "Many of our veteran fighters had served under the Italians and others under private militias after the Liberation. We should apply the same principles we'd applied then and take steps to seamlessly integrate the Eritrean forces into the Ethiopian military."
ETH_Construct_Naval_Base_desc:0 "We will spare no expense in the creation of a port in Asamara, which will be so grand that it will blow away the naval empires of today as it will showcase the true naval strength of the empire!"
ETH_Intergration_Of_Eritrea_desc:0 "Twenty years later, unrest within Eritrea has almost subsided and the people living within the region are beginning to form an optimistic view of the empire. It seems that, in the near future, potential unrest will begin to decline."
ETH_Develop_Eritrea_desc:0 "Unlike the Italian imperialists, who had rarely invested in Eritrea, as a show of goodwill, we will begin heavy investments into the region."
ETH_Invest_In_Industry_desc:0 "Industrialisation is the only way forward. We cannot avoid this crucial policy as the empire requires more factories to boost its production."
ETH_Tribal_Modernisation_desc:0 "We shall guarantee the rights of tribal groups and other minorities so long as they fulfil their obligations!"
ETH_Southern_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "We shall expand our industrialisation programme and create new factories in the southern portion of our nation. That way, profits and jobs from this sector of the economy will be better distributed, boosting both productivity and profit."
ETH_Military_Industrial_Expansion_desc:0 "As the years go by, it is apparent that our army will require higher quality equipment and adequate supplies. We will begin the mass production of weapons and supplies in order to help our armed forces better defend the empire."
ETH_German_Investment_desc:0 "Since we have demonstrated our relative stability and unwavering loyalty towards Germany, perhaps they could begin investing abroad, in Ethiopia, to help combat the effects of Black Monday and, in the process, help better develop Ethiopia."
ETH_German_Aid_desc:0 "We will ensure Germany does not forget the assistance we'd provided them with during the Weltkrieg. German investors, private and state-sponsored, will help bring prosperity to Ethiopia."
ETH_Debt_desc:0 "Upon the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, our nation's debt had, and has continued to, spiralled out of control. Sorely needed reforms cannot be enacted until the issue of the debt has been fully dealt with."
ETH_German_Military_Mission_desc:0 "Since we've already reached out to Germany with regards to receiving investment and aid, it would also be in our best interest to request military advisers in order to learn how to better drill our soldiers, improve our tactics, and, overall, modernise our army."
ETH_Tax_Church_desc:0 "Alas, we must turn to taxing the church as the funds are desperately required by the empire to pay off its debt."
ETH_Tax_Slaveowners_desc:0 "A large majority, if not all, slave owners are well off. By taxing slaves, we can extract more wealth from the extremely well-to-do citizens of our nation. While this may be seen as controversial by some, it will be a great boon to our budget."
ETH_Tax_Oromo_desc:0 "The Oromo people have been granted many privileges. We will need to end them in order to promote equality within the empire and improve our budget and, by extension, our ability to pay off our debt."
ETH_Tax_Eritrea_desc:0 "We'd freed the Eritreans upon the conclusion of the Weltkrieg and granted them special privileges within the empire. However, the time for them has ended as most Eritreans see themselves as Ethiopians anyway and, if they truly believe themselves worthy of our great nation, they must begin contributing towards the prosperity of the empire."
ETH_Budget_desc:0 "Due to budget reform and readjustment, we can finally begin the next step of the Emperor's plan: reformation."
ETH_Haile_desc:0 "Haile Selassie I is a reformer in the best possible way. He is a dynamic man who understands what is required to modernise Ethiopia and drag it out of the past, which it has been stuck in for far too long. While the path of modernisation will not be easy, it says a lot about the King's character and his willingness to help his nation."
ETH_Educate_Slaves_desc:0 "With former slaves now free, it is clear that we must take steps to properly integrate them within Ethiopian society. Incidentally, this has also coincided with our plans to reform and expand the education system. By undertaking these planned reforms, we will ensure that the future minds of Ethiopia are well educated!"
ETH_Slavery_Question_desc:0 "Slavery simply has no place any modern nation, let alone the great empire envisioned by Haile Selassie I. Thankfully, the newly instituted slaveowner tax has meant that it is cheaper to hire workers than own slaves, and so the abolition of slavery will, most likely, not face great opposition. However, it will still be a massive undertaking to heal the social and cultural wounds endured by the oppressed folk."
ETH_Agriculture_Initative_desc:0 "Ensuring the existence of an organised agricultural sector, especially a prosperous one, is paramount to the future of the empire. As Ethiopia grows, so does its population and its food consumption. In order to avoid overextending our production capabilities and suffering from famines, we must begin undertaking significant agricultural reforms."
ETH_Land_Reform_desc:0 "Land ownership within Ethiopia still operates based on an archaic system, where the people who hold the land only do so because of their abundant power or wealth. Legal ownership of land is uncommon and this has been a problem for quite a long time. It is time we begin the reformation of land ownership and distribution and actively enforce those laws."
ETH_Modernise_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "In order to modernise our empire, we must drag ourselves out of the Dark Ages of the Zemene Mesafint and begin centralisation, increasing efficiency within the government and the bureaucracy. Successfully implementing these new ideas, however, will be an arduous task."
ETH_Tax_Question_desc:0 "As it stands, we've no official tax code. In order to westernise our nation, reformation of the tax code is crucial. We currently have a few options in front of us: one, we can support the people and institute a land tax that will primarily fall on the wealthy, two, we can listen to our western advisers and push for a progressive tax system, and, three, we can listen to the aristocrats and institute a low, flat tax."
ETH_Permanent_Feudal_Borders_desc:0 "Order and stability within the empire are both of the utmost importance. We must decisively, yet gently, end the infighting between the upper classes lest they remain at each other's throats, threatening the empire's stability."
ETH_Governorship_Question_desc:0 "Deciding who will govern the various provinces of Ethiopia will be an extremely crucial decision, with many far reaching consequences. That being said, we've a few options in front of us: we can allow the people to elect their respective governors, allow the Negus to appoint governors, or we can allow the upper class to govern their own lands."
ETH_Ethiopia_Scout_Association_desc:0 "The Ethiopian youth need to spend their bountiful energy in better, more productive pursuits. What better way to help them do that than by creating the Ethiopian Scout Association, a state-sponsored organisation which will help young men within our nation work on bettering the empire."
ETH_Military_Question_desc:0 "Currently, the officers within our army belong to only noble backgrounds or are members of the Selassie family, with commoners being denied promotion to most of the high positions within the military, no matter their competency. Perhaps we could allow commoners to serve as high ranking officers within the army, promoting them based on merit instead of class."
ETH_Finish_The_Reforms_desc:0 "We've finally completed the reformation of the empire, with the only thing left being the ratification of those reformations through the creation of a new constitution."
ETH_New_Constitucion_desc:0 "A new constitution will be written up for the empire, containing and enforcing the reforms made by us during its drafting. The empire shall move forward, now stronger than ever!"
ETH_People_Constitucion_desc:0 "The legitimacy of a ruler is derived from the support of his people. Haile Selassie I will be the first Ethiopian emperor to grant control of vast parts of the state's apparatus to democratically elected officials. The voice of the common folk and the disenfranchised shall be heard."
ETH_Freedom_Speech_desc:0 "The people deserve the right to say as they please, no matter if we agree with them or not, and the state should defend their right to say those things. Disagreement is how we, as a nation, can bring forth new ideas and, ultimately, progress."
ETH_Freedom_Religion_desc:0 "Ethiopia, in its lengthy history, has been the home of people of many faiths. From the Jews of old Axum to the Muslims of the walled city of Harar, citizens of Ethiopia, no matter their religion, shall live peacefully and free, equal to all."
ETH_Enrich_People_desc:0 "Poverty prevents our citizens from experiencing potential material gain and prosperity. We must protect even the poorest of our subjects, to ensure that each and every single one of them can possess an optimistic future."
ETH_Elections_desc:0 "Ethiopia, for the first time ever, will organise free and democratic elections. Political parties are beginning to rally, people are getting ready to vote, and many are eager for what lies ahead while others are anxious. Who shall be the first Prime Minister, appointed by His Majesty himself?"
ETH_Emperor_Constitucion_desc:0 "We've allowed men of inferior character and lesser status to impede Ethiopia's natural progression for far too long. We shall have to take measures to reorganise the empire in such a way that will allow for the Negus to rightfully assume a position of power and authority."
ETH_Revered_Emperor_desc:0 "The citizens of Ethiopia must keep in mind that His Majesty, Haile Selassie I, has brought peace, stability, freedom, and justice to the reformed Empire of Ethiopia."
ETH_Control_Church_desc:0 "Those who are faithful require proper guidance. Not from those who would seek earthly power or material possession, but from those who will ensure that peace and stability are maintained within the empire through the blessed rule of the King of Kings."
ETH_Royal_Advisors_desc:0 "Only those who are close, and qualified, advisers to the Emperor shall have a say in the governance of His Majesty's empire. That way, we can ensure efficient governance and quality leadership."
ETH_Lion_Of_Judah_desc:0 "From the entourage who had helped escort the Queen of Sheba back home, His Majesty, Selassie, is the embodiment of the symbol of the mighty lion and the 225th king from King David. The greatest of all earthly lords, His Majesty has had a legacy so grand, that it outshines even his mighty efforts to help further Ethiopia's glory."
ETH_Noble_Constitucion_desc:0 "The noble lords and ladies of Ethiopia have managed to hold the empire together for millennia and shall continue to do so! Concerns such as the budget and management of the military are too trivial to bother the mighty King of Kings. Instead, his vassals shall tend to these affairs in his stead."
ETH_Noble_Investment_desc:0 "We shall ensure that Ethiopia acquires whatever it deems necessary, by any means necessary. No matter the cost nor the people we shall deal with in order to acquire these necessities."
ETH_Power_Of_Tradition_desc:0 "Nobles are of such high stature not because of their blood or ancestral ties, but because they have been trained from birth to obtain and better their skills as administrators, soldiers, or businessmen. Why alter a system that has worked, and will continue to work, for millennia?"
ETH_Noble_Armies_desc:0 "Our armies possess men who have been trained from birth to effectively and decisively lead our troops. In addition, with the recent acquisition of proper equipment and superior training for our foot soldiers, victory is only a natural outcome against any foe."
ETH_Power_Council_desc:0 "It is time for a council made up of nobles to seize full power of the government from Selassie's thugs. From now on, Selassie will rule as a King among Kings, remaining a weak figurehead for the council to rally behind, if needed."
ETH_Military_Reforms_desc:0 "Our military's performance during the Weltkrieg was, unfortunately, very poor. We shall evaluate the reason for this and discover a proper solution, so that we may reclaim and retake our territory in Ogaden; rightfully ours by treaty and law."
ETH_Hire_Askari_Veterans_desc:0 "Many of the Askari veterans within Mittelafrika tire of their garrison duty, constantly patrolling for unseen foes. We shall bring them here, where their skills and experience can be properly utilised."
ETH_New_Arms_Production_desc:0 "We must increase our efforts to better equip our army as, according to the Askari, our handguns are better suited to remain a part of a hunter's collection than remain in an army's arsenal."
ETH_Import_Small_Arms_desc:0 "The poor state and quality of our handguns can be improved, however, with some effort on our part by reverse engineering foreign models. The issue, however, is purchasing said guns."
ETH_Artillery_Effort_desc:0 "As the Weltkrieg has shown us, and the rest of the world, artillery is an extremely vital part of modern warfare. Yet, we've never been able to master these large-calibre guns. Thankfully, our foreign advisers understand how to design and man these shell-firing guns."
ETH_Buy_Tanks_desc:0 "While tanks and other mechanised vehicles may be ill suited for the highlands of Gondar, they may make all the difference in the flat plains of Ogaden and could be the deciding factor on whether or not we experience victory or defeat."
ETH_Foreign_Doctrine_desc:0 "The military high command has reached a unanimous conclusion: Hurling wave after wave of militia at the enemy may not be the best course of action. Perhaps it would be best to ask our foreign officers/advisers what would be the best course of action? Noble officers can be rather stubborn, after all..."
ETH_Improve_Firepower_desc:0 "Victory will be achieved through the use of extensive firepower! Our enemies shall be trampled by both the might and range of our guns! We shall take steps to better utilise these guns, in order to achieve maximum efficiency."
ETH_Modernise_High_Command_desc:0 "Perhaps we should refine our military doctrine and, instead of attacking the enemy with the use of brute force, we should choose men who are patient, proper, and skilled to plan and lead our army."
ETH_Legacy_Of_Adowa_desc:0 "We cannot nor will we ever rely on foreigners to acquire victory. The people of the world have, for far too long, forgotten the might of the Victory of Adwa. All of Africa shall see us for what we truly are; the mighty lion!"
ETH_Ethiopian_Guns_desc:0 "By utilising foreign expertise and basing our designs off of external blueprints, we can ensure Ethiopian-made guns, made by Ethiopians for Ethiopians, are of the highest calibre whilst remaining inexpensive."
ETH_Special_Equipment_desc:0 "Ensuring that our brave men have anything and everything at their disposal is important to aid them in the continual fight for the empire's independence and victory."
ETH_Anti_Imperialist_Spirit_desc:0 "Those who attempt to conquer us continually underestimate our spirit and determination. From Wofla to Adwa, envious and unscrupulous vultures attempt to break our spirit and subjugate the people of Ethiopia. So long as our spirit lives on, they shall never succeed!"
ETH_Improve_Drilling_desc:0 "We will sharpen minds, tire legs, train arms, and, through relentless drilling, shape these ragged folk we call 'soldiers' into proper and trim fighting men!"
ETH_Trust_Officers_desc:0 "Ensuring that our officers have a greater degree of autonomy in the battlefield is extremely crucial, as that would enable them to adapt to the ever changing landscape of modern war."
ETH_Develop_Weapons_desc:0 "Rather than purely copying advanced techniques, we should also ensure that our guns are designed and built within the empire, for the men of the empire."
ETH_Proffesional_Army_desc:0 "We have managed to triumph in resolving the failures of our army and have turned them into advantageous successes. Our army, which was once a mass of conscripted men, has now become a truly proper and organised fighting force. We can now direct our focus towards our peacetime affairs, as we are truly prepared in the case of a war."
ETH_Doctrine_I_desc:0 "Understanding naval tactics is far more than merely steering a ship towards enemy waters. Missions and operational hierarchy are vital components of any naval doctrine. Thankfully, because of its young age, our navy is flexible and able to adapt to any sort of change."
ETH_Submarine_Effort_desc:0 "Because of the strategic location of our ports, near the Gulf of Aden, it is important that we invest in submarine technology in order to destroy enemy shipping lanes and, subsequently, starve them of desperately needed supplies."
ETH_Submarine_Doctrine_desc:0 "A grand blockade of the Red Sea shall be planned in order for us to better control shipping lanes in the area. No convoy shall be given permission to pass through, unless we deem it fit to do so."
ETH_Destroyer_desc:0 "Ensuring our convoys are safe from enemy raiding efforts is crucial. Because of this, the creation of anti-submarine vessels with patrols, who will maintain watch regularly, is in order."
ETH_Cruiser_desc:0 "The navy will require more tonnage if we are to attain full control of the Horn. Cruisers will be paramount to this effort, especially if the projections of Somalian naval power are correct."
ETH_Doctrine_II_desc:0 "The creation of a proper school for prospective naval officers is paramount to the war at sea. As war fast approaches, we must ensure that our officers are ready to adapt and conquer the ever changing tactics at sea."
ETH_Dream_Sky_desc:0 "Control of the skies are within our reach, but it could soon slip out of our grasp. News has reached Addis Ababa that Somalia is planning the purchase of more airplanes in order to expand its air force. The goal of this blatant escalation of tensions is obvious and shall not go unanswered!"
ETH_Hire_Experts_desc:0 "In order to truly wrest control of the skies, it is clear that we will require the advice of experienced foreign experts. When we acquire the skills these experts possess, only then can we fully wrest full aerial control of the Horn!"
ETH_Advanced_Doctrine_desc:0 "Planning air missions is a rather complicated matter due to the sheer amount of factors that must be taken into account. Weather, distance, and the number of enemy forces must all be equally considered. However, most of our pilots are either not qualified or talented enough to understand the basics of aerial planning. Training them would be the obvious resolution to such an issue."
ETH_Train_Pilots_desc:0 "Possessing planes means little if our pilots are unable to skilfully and properly fly them. The Imperial Air Force can become a force to be reckoned with, however we must give it the attention it deserves before it can reach such a level."
ETH_Skylions_desc:0 "The training of a group of men, who rank amongst the best of our pilots, shall take place. They will, with the heart of a lion, fall straight from the skies into battle and strike where we could never hope to reach and win the fight we could never hope to win!"
ETH_Harer_Airbase_desc:0 "The existing airfield within Harar shall undergo an expansion in order to prepare for the upcoming war against Somalia. The aerial high command projects that, if the airfield does undergo expansion, our planes can reach even the farthest point of Somalia."
ETH_fighter_focus_desc:0 "Ensuring the aerial dominance of the Horn will be a difficult task, no matter who you ask. However, we believe that, with the reformation of our air force, we can successfully accomplish the endeavour."
ETH_bomber_focus_desc:0 "The undertaking of the creation of new bombers will be extremely beneficial to the Ethiopian war effort. The cities, ports, and supply lines of our enemies shall be within the reach of our airplanes to raze. We will emerge triumphant!"
ETH_CAS_effort_desc:0 "Controlling the battlefield from the air is an attractive prospect; However, possessing the aircraft and the pilots capable of doing so is both expensive and time consuming."
ETH_Crush_Somalia_desc:0 "Ogaden is rightfully ours as mandated by the treaty which had ended the Weltkrieg. However, the weakness of previous rulers and trouble within Eritrea prevented us from enforcing this claim. Since our enemy, the Mad Mullah, is dead and Germany is no longer in a position to intervene in African affairs, we shall strike at Somalia and reclaim the lands that rightfully belong to Ethiopia!"
ETH_Pacify_Ogaden_desc:0 "The easiest part of conquest is often gaining control of the land itself. However, pacifying the locals and integrating them into Ethiopian society is another matter altogether. Integrating Ogaden into Ethiopia is of the utmost importance, so that we may retain control of the land and its people."
ETH_Industrial_Modernisation_desc:0 "Ethiopia is sorely lacking in terms of industrial capacity and manufacturing. On top of that, our economy is extremely small and very isolated. Because of this, we lack an international presence. In order to remedy this, we must take steps to industrialise our economy."
ETH_Heavy_Industry_desc:0 "Proper utilisation of our industrial capacity is paramount in order to fuel the creation of heavy construction material in order to conduct government projects in an efficient manner."
ETH_Coffee_desc:0 "Due to the chaotic situation in Brazil, a large demand for coffee has recently opened up. We can take advantage of this by modernising our harvesting techniques and growing more coffee plants, thereby producing more coffee beans. Doing so will greatly boost our income as a nation. After all, who doesn't like coffee?"
ETH_Finish_Modernisation_desc:0 "Our industrialisation efforts have come to fruition at last. The future is now within our reach; we just need to grasp it!"

ethiopia.1.t:0 "Ethiopia, an Empire at Crossroads"
ethiopia.1.d:0 "Abyssinia, also known by the endonym of Ethiopia, was the only African state which managed to remain independent during the nineteenth century, having successfully defeated an Italian invasion in 1896. This victory was symbolic of the process of modernisation within the Abyssinian Empire which had sought to bring the country up to date with European standards in terms of its economy, military and administration. In 1918, under empress Zewditu, Abyssinia entered the Weltkrieg on the side of the Germans, successfully annexing the Italian colony Eritrea and dealing with the pretender emperor Iyasu. However, the army performed rather poorly against Italy's garrisons and the few Entente raids into the Empire. Control over the disputed area of Harar was not enforced as the Somali forces which held much of the area could not be dislodged and have not been even to this day. When the old Empress Zewditu died with no surviving children, her cousin, regent and oftentimes rival Ras Tafari Makonnen ascended to the throne as Emperor Haile Selassie. The new monarch announced his intention to undertake a new series of reforms in order to westernise Abyssinia as the main leader of the reactionary faction, his predecessor, was out of the picture.\n\nThese initiatives, however, were fiercely opposed by the conservative nobility of the nation, minor kings and dukes who saw in Zewditu someone much more amenable to their vision for the Empire. Ties with Germany, the new owners of nearby Djibouti, were strengthened as a railroad connecting the outpost, Addis Ababa and Kenya was built (mostly with German capital). Relations have since been positive, despite reports of eccentric behaviour by the new Mittelafrikan governor. However, relations with Somalia and their Ottoman backers continue to be tense at best and a confrontation seems inevitable. The Emperor knows that such a war would require a united empire, under one banner and cause, as the ambitious dukes may well side with an enemy if they remain with their power unchecked and thus matters at home must be dealt with first."
ethiopia.1.a:0 "We stand strong!"
ethiopia.2.t:0 "The DKAEB Approaches Bankruptcy"
ethiopia.2.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, and linked Addis Ababa to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is now used mainly to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. Because of the general economic downturn worldwide, ore is no longer being purchased at the rate it once was, resulting in fewer transports for the DPAEB. The situation has now reached such a level that the railway itself is nearing bankruptcy."
ethiopia.2.a:0 "Keep it running!"
ethiopia.railway.bankruptcy:0 "Bankruptcy is looming!"
ethiopia.2.b:0 "Sell the railway."
ethiopia.3.t:0 "The DKAEB Has Been Sold"
ethiopia.3.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) railway was established in the early 20th century, linking Addis Ababa, in Ethiopia, to Djibouti. After a series of German-backed expansions, it is now used mainly to transport ore from the Congo Basin, in Mittelafrika, to Djibouti. The present economic downturn in the world has meant that ore is no longer being purchased at the rate it once was, resulting in fewer transports for the DPAEB. The situation has now reached such a critical level that Germany has decided to sell the railway."
ethiopia.3.a:0 "Buy the Ethiopian section of the railway."
ethiopia.3.b:0 "We must let German companies buy the railway."
ethiopia.4.a:0 "Buy the Mittelafrikan section of the railway."
ethiopia.4.b:0 "A European consortium ends up buying the railway."
ethiopia.5.t:0 "The DKAEB Goes Bankrupt!"
ethiopia.5.d:0 "Our decision to try and keep the Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn (DKAEB) running was indeed a short sighted one. The DKAEB, despite our attempts to revive it, has gone bankrupt!"
ethiopia.5.a:0 "Damn!"
ethiopia.6.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn has gone bankrupt! Our primary export link, running from the Congo to Djibouti, has been forced to close down. Large numbers of people are now jobless."
ethiopia.6.a:0 "Damn..."
ethiopia.7.d:0 "The Deutsche Kaiserliche Abessinien Eisenbahn has gone bankrupt! This major transport link, running from the Congo to Djibouti through Ethiopia, has been forced to shut down. Large numbers of people now stand jobless."
ethiopia.7.a:0 "We will take it off their hands!"
ethiopia.8.t:0 "Drought!"
ethiopia.8.d:0 "A great drought has swept through eastern Ethiopia. With the economy already weakened by the decline of the DKAEB, we are now at risk of facing mass starvation as crops continually fail."
ethiopia.8.a:0 "Damn!"
ethiopia.8.b:0 "Use the newly nationalised railway to distribute food!"
ethiopia.9.t:0 "Budget Readjustment"
ethiopia.9.d:0 "Now that we have taxed our people and institutions enough to pay off our crippling debts, it is time we began the readjustment of our budget and ended this debt crisis once and for all. We can choose to refocus the aim of our budget on one of three things: military production, civilian production, or construction. Which one shall we choose?"
ethiopia.9.a:0 "Military Production."
ethiopia.9.b:0 "Civilian Production."
ethiopia.9.c:0 "Construction."
ethiopia.10.t:0 "Reforms in Ethiopia"
ethiopia.10.d:0 "Our emperor, Haile Selassie, is known to hold the ambition of modernising the country. This includes not only plans to build new factories, the reformation of our infrastructure, and the modernisation of our army, but also several legal and institutional reforms that will, hopefully, improve the Ethiopian quality of life. However, the broadening of these reforms will mean an end to the many privileges held by the nobility."
ethiopia.10.a:0 "Start the reforms."
ethiopia.11.t:0 "Question of Slavery"
ethiopia.11.d:0 "The institution of slavery is still widespread in Ethiopia, with almost 2 million people currently living under its oppressive rule. This has brought much criticism from the west upon Ethiopia and it is quite obvious we must abolish this institution in order to truly westernise our nation. However, the nobility will be quite angry with this change and we may instead institute a new law, nicknamed the 'Freedom of Womb', to try and appease them and delay the death of slavery, yet slowly kill it off."
ethiopia.11.a:0 "Abolish Slavery!"
ethiopia.11.b:0 "We must delay the abolition, Freedom of Womb."
ethiopia.12.t:0 "Land Reform"
ethiopia.12.d:0 "Land ownership within Ethiopia still operates based on an archaic system, where the people who hold the land only do so because of their abundant power or wealth. Legal ownership of land is uncommon and this has been a problem for quite a long time. It is time we begin the reformation of land ownership and distribution and actively enforce those laws. There are a few ways we can go about doing so: "
ethiopia.12.a:0 "Redistribute the land to the people."
ethiopia.12.b:0 "All land shall be owned in name by the Negus."
ethiopia.12.c:0 "Formalise the current ownership under the nobility."
ethiopia.13.t:0 "Tax Reform"
ethiopia.13.d:0 "The Empire of Ethiopia has never, in its entire history, formalised an official tax code. In order to westernise we must begin the reformation and finalisation of our tax code. There are a few options: we can listen to the people and institute a land tax, which will fall primarily on the rich landowners, we can listen to our western advisers, who advise us to copy the progressive tax system of the European powers, or we can listen to the nobles and institute a low flat tax."
ethiopia.13.a:0 "Institute a land tax."
ethiopia.13.b:0 "Institute a progressive tax."
ethiopia.13.c:0 "Institute a flat tax."
ethiopia.14.t:0 "Governorship Reform"
ethiopia.14.d:0 "It is time to decide who will govern the various provinces of the Ethiopian empire. There are a few options: we can either allow the people to elect their governors, we can allow the Negus to appoint them, or we can allow the nobles to govern their own land."
ethiopia.14.a:0 "Governors should be elected by the people."
ethiopia.14.b:0 "The Negus shall appoint his governors."
ethiopia.14.c:0 "Let the nobles govern their own land."
ethiopia.15.t:0 "Military Reform"
ethiopia.15.d:0 "As it stands, our army is commanded by nobles and members of the Selassie family. Commoners are barred from most, if not all, of the high positions within the military — even if they possess a better understanding of military affairs or warfare than the nobles. Should we allow commoners to hold high ranking positions within the army?"
ethiopia.15.a:0 "Military positions shall be meritocratic."
ethiopia.15.b:0 "Keep the army as it is."
ethiopia.16.t:0 "End of the Reforms"
ethiopia.16.d:0 "Selassie's era of reforms are now over. For better, or for worse, the nation has changed radically and modernisation has been achieved. The Lion of Judah has been added to the empire's flag in order to symbolise the rebirth of the Ethiopian empire and it is now time to start looking towards the drafting and formalisation of a new constitution for the empire."
ethiopia.16.a:0 "God bless the Lion."
ethiopia.17.t:0 "Selassie's Constitution"
ethiopia.17.d:0 "Selassie has managed to secure supreme power for himself, and this is reflected in the new constitution. It includes many articles which bestow powers upon the Negus, however it also contains reforms built towards modernising the legal framework of Ethiopia. Ethiopia is now very much the Emperor's nation."
ethiopia.17.a:0 "All hail the Lion of Judah."
ethiopia.18.t:0 "Mekawint's Constitution"
ethiopia.18.d:0 "Through the blocking of many reforms and the institution of their own, the nobles have managed to secure power for themselves, and the new constitution reflects this. It contains articles that grant absolute power to the Upper House, which is dominated by nobles, and restricts democracy and the Emperor's power. The age-old traditions of Ethiopia have been protected and it will continue to remain a country of the nobles and for the nobles."
ethiopia.18.a:0 "The Negusa Nesat is weak."
ethiopia.19.t:0 "People's Constitution"
ethiopia.19.d:0 "Haile Selassie has instituted reforms that have westernised and brought democracy to the country, and the new constitution reflects this. It contains articles that protect the freedoms of the people and empowers the Lower House, which is controlled by the people. The power of the nobles, and even Selassie himself, has been restricted and it is clear that Ethiopia is now a westernised, constitutional monarchy."
ethiopia.19.a:0 "The people are strong."
ethiopia.20.t:0 "The First Elections"
ethiopia.20.d:0 "For the first time in Ethiopia's grand history, democratic and fair elections will take place. The main participants within the election are: the right-wing 'Democratic League', the centre-right 'United Ethiopian Democratic Forces', the centre-left 'Coalition for Unity and Democracy', and the left-wing 'Ethiopian People's Democratic Front'. The ballots have been counted, and the winners of the election are the: "
ethiopia.20.a:0 "Democratic League."
ethiopia.20.b:0 "United Ethiopian Democratic Forces."
ethiopia.20.c:0 "Coalition for Unity and Democracy."
ethiopia.20.e:0 "Ethiopian People's Democratic Front."
ethiopia.21.t:0 "Power to the Council"
ethiopia.21.d:0 "It is time for the council of nobles to seize full control of the government from Selassie's goons as, from now on, he will be ruling as a King among Kings, remaining a weak figurehead for the council to rally behind, if and when he is needed."
ethiopia.21.a:0 "Praise the council."
ethiopia.22.t:0 "Eritrean Revolt!"
ethiopia.22.d:0 "The people of Eritrea have had enough of being taxed to oblivion, and with the tribal leaders and army officers remaining unintegrated, Eritrean nationalists have managed to organise a revolt against our rule during this desperate time of war. We must begin swift mobilisation in order to put them down and ensure stability!"
ethiopia.22.a:0 "Damned backstabbers!"
ethiopia.23.t:0 "Victory over Somalia"
ethiopia.23.d:0 "We have finally crushed the Somalis in war and now it is time to choose: Shall we install a friendly regime in Somalia or simply occupy the entire country?"
ethiopia.23.a:0 "Install a friendly regime."
ethiopia.23.b:0 "Occupy the entirety of Somalia."

ethiopia.24.t:0 "Aksumite Dreamin’"
ethiopia.24.d:0 "Standing as the last independent and non-colonized place in Africa, our Ethiopia has withstood each and every horror and strife life could throw at us, and yet we still have yet to be able to accomplish any grand goal or national ambition, for we have been beset by foreign foes and domestic parasites for far too long. However, with our new government policies taking hold and with Abyssinia finally stabilized and healing, perhaps it is time to look beyond our borders once again? It has been nearly a millennium since the great Kingdom of Aksum dominated these lands, and many clamor for this level of Ethiopian dominance over the Horn and northeastern Africa once again, begging that the old lands of Aksum and Kush are simply lying out in the open, ready for the taking since the collapse of Ottoman authority. So, should we march to reclaim the Aksumite legacy lost to use in 960 AD, or should forget the past in order to embrace the future and our new modernist destiny?"
ethiopia.24.a:0 "We shall not rest until the lands of Aksum and Kush are ours once again!"
ethiopia.24.b:0 "Enjoy our splendid isolation on the Horn."

ethiopia.25.t:0 "Ethiopia Wishes to Join our Faction"
ethiopia.25.d:0 "We have received a delegation from Ethiopia requesting to join our alliance. Ethiopia lies at a strategically important position in the Horn of Africa and their inclusion into our faction could greatly expand our influence in the Indian Ocean and the strategically important Red Sea. What should we do?"
ethiopia.25.a:0 "They are welcome!"
ethiopia.25.b:0 "We don't need them."

ethiopia.26.t:0 "Negotiations Fail"
ethiopia.26.d:0 "The [Root.GetName] has refused to grant us entry into their faction, it's not like we needed them anyways."
ethiopia.26.a:0 "Damn."

ethiopia.27.t:0 "Ethiopia’s Place on the World Stage"
ethiopia.27.d:0 "Our Ethiopia sits at the crossroads between global superpowers and competing ideological spheres, but nevertheless we still need allies in this tumultuous and evermore chaotic world. The most obvious and natural choices would either be to suck up to our economic overlords in Berlin or our former rivals in Ottawa in order to secure an easy alliance with the overeager Western wolves, or we could forge our own path alone or in our own Afrocentric alliance. We could also ask the adventurers from Sagallo about the possibility of joining the reborn Russian sphere. Alternatively, we could yield to the ‘Japanizers’ who seek to enact our own form of the Meiji Restoration here in Addis Ababa by joining the Co-Prosperity Sphere - a move already supported by the exotic love life of some of our princes like Araya Abeba and his new Japanese bride Kuroda Masako, or we could listen to more progressive and ‘socially’ inclined members of the royal family like Imru Selassie and Asfaw Wossen Tafari by caving into their demands to join the Third Internationale in order to defend ourselves from the imperialist interests of the Germans and the Anglos with their French attack dogs. Whatever we decide, we must choose what is best for Ethiopia at large."
ethiopia.27.a:0 "Cave to the colonial giant and join the Reichspakt."
ethiopia.27.b:0 "Forgive the past and look towards the Entente."
ethiopia.27.c:0 "Yield to the Japaniser Movement and join the Co-Prosperity Sphere."
ethiopia.27.e:0 "Listen to the anti-imperialist pleas of Imru and Asfwa by joining the Third Internationale."
ethiopia.27.f:0 "Utilize our Cossack contacts to call the Russians."
ethiopia.27.g:0 "Create our own anti-imperialist Pan-African faction."
ethiopia.27.h:0 "Ethiopia stood alone before and survived, and we shall do so again!"

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_AHMAD_SHAH_QAJAR_DESC: "Installed as Shah of Iran at the age of eleven, it could be argued that Ahmad Shah was always at the whim of the Majilis, only a figurehead in a nation still struggling with the aftermath of the events of the 1920's and beforehand. Though he would attempt to repair and unite the nation, his efforts would almost always collapse. Though the most turbulent part of his reign is arguably at an end, that does not mean there are not those wishing to see the Shah removed - whether it be Democrats who wish to establish a republic, Royalists who want install a new monarch that can surpass Ahmad Shah's abilities, or even Socialists who want to bring about a socialist revolution akin to the one declared in 1920. It seems, with all these enemies against the Shah, and his health in steady decline, that it is only a matter of time before chaos erupts across the nation."
POLITICS_HASSAN_MIRZA_QAJAR_DESC: "As the Crown-Prince of Iran, Hassan Mirza lived in his older brother’s shadow ever since he was installed as Shah, and had little influence in the politics of Iran during the early years of Ahmad Shah’s rule. From a young age, he would be exposed to the countless conflicts and civil uprisings that plagued the nation, from the Jangali Uprising to foreign intervention from the British and Russia, all the while his brother would seemingly do little to stop it all.  Over many years however, he would slowly build up the political, military, and diplomatic connections he desired, and attained the respect that was fit for the brother and heir of the Shah. Now, with his ascension to the Sun Throne, he has reached the very top of the Iranian political world, and it is certain he will not squander the opportunity to bring Iran into the modern age as a force to be reckoned with."
POLITICS_SAYYED_HASAN_TAQIZADEH_DESC: "Taqizadeh, despite being known as one of the biggest and most influential advocates for modernisation and constitutionalism, came from a family of clergymen who were descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, and it had seemed that he would follow in the footsteps of his family. However, his interest and experience with Western democracy and modern enlightenment caused him to follow a new career into politics, where he soon became a strong advocate against the Qajars and for sweeping reforms to the nation in order for it to flourish in the 20th century. With the revolution that has swept the nation, and the deposition of the Qajars, Taqizadeh has formed a new government that will seek to recreate Iran as a nation of true democracy and prosperity."
POLITICS_IRAJ_ESKANDARI_DESC: "As a Qajar Prince, Eskandari was given an education in France where he was exposed to the young syndicalist nation and its socialist teachings, to which he had soon begun to admire. He would link up with other Iranian socialists in the country, and even some of the key figures of the Edalat Party who had been forced to flee after Ahmad Shah's attempted assassination, and the subsequent crackdown of socialism. Though he was unable to return home, he would slowly become one of the more popular figures of socialism in Iran, especially as the movement would begin to see greater popularity amongst the workers and peasants of Iran. With the Edalat Party now in power, Eskandari has been appointed as President of the new Socialist Republic, promising greater freedoms for peasants and unions, and the redistribution of wealth to the common people."

### Events ###

pers.1.t: "Introduction to [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.1.d: "In the past few decades, [PER.GetNameDef] has been in a state of constant change and instability. Having gained full independence from Russia and the British Empire, we have struggled to find our own place in this world. All around [PER.GetNameDef], from the smallest hamlet in the furthest corners of the nation to the big cities like [266.GetName], we can see the difference in beliefs between the people. Just a few years ago, the Shah himself was shot by a socialist assassin. Although he survived, the Shah's health has been declining by the day. It is clear the nation cannot survive like it is, and with the Shah's death looming, there are fears ideological divide could turn into open revolt. Democrats trying to force a republic, royalists who would support a powerful monarchy lead by the Shah's brother, Hassan Mirza, and socialists, attempting to create the first socialist state in the Middle East. We can only hope the power transition is peaceful...\n\nOur nation's military is in shambles, and we are still recovering from a famine that killed millions of our people. Not only that, our political class is dominated by a corrupt aristocracy, ruining our political legitimacy. Our nation has many problems to sort out, but if we can do it successfully, we could become the greatest Empire the Middle East has ever seen."
pers.1.a: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] will be strong!"

pers.2.t: "The Shah is Dead!"
pers.2.d: "Reports this morning have come in informing us about the passing of Ahmad Shah Qajar. After he was shot in an assassination attempt by a socialist a few years ago, his health was poor, and it seems that this, combined with the increasing stress of ruling the nation, has lead to his death. Hassan Mirza, Ahmad's brother and heir to the Sun Throne, has taken power, but a power struggle has already begun among the many factions in [PER.GetNameDef]. Mirza himself has greater ambitions for the Qajar Dynasty, bringing suspicion from politicians in the Majlis. The socialists, a group that has been banned for many years, may try and rear its head at the sight of potential power.\n\nCurrently, the only question is whether Hassan Mirza stays in the country, or flees for his safety."
pers.2.a: "Mirza will stay in [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.2.b: "Mirza flees."

pers.3.t: "Loyalists storm Majlis"
pers.3.d: "People loyal to the Qajar Dynasty have stormed the Majlis under the command of Hassan Mirza, to try and eliminate potential threats. After all was done, many politicians were arrested to secure a safe transition in government. The Majlis have been closed until further notice."
pers.3.a: "Power to the Shah!"

pers.4.t: "Absolute Monarchy formed"
pers.4.d: "The monarchy has seized full power in [PER.GetNameDef]. No longer will we have to worry about petty things like democracy or liberty, for they are not needed anymore."
pers.4.a: "Long Live the Shah!"

pers.5.t: "What happens now?"
pers.5.d: "Mirza has decided to stay in [PER.GetNameDef]. There are many people loyal to him, willing to fight for him. We could command these people to storm the Majlis to keep order and capture any potential threats. We could also send these people to capture key points in [266.GetName] to try and secure power. However, Hassan Mirza could also not command the people at all to try and keep peace."
pers.5.a: "Send the loyalists to the Majlis."
pers.5.b: "Send the loyalists to capture key points in [266.GetName]."
pers.5.c: "Let's not stir up trouble."

pers.6.t: "What happens now?"
pers.6.d: "Although Hassan Mirza has decided to flee [PER.GetNameDef], there are many people still loyal to him, willing to fight. We could command these people to storm the Majlis to keep order and capture any potential threats. We could also send these people to capture key points in [266.GetName] to try and secure power. However, Hassan Mirza could also not command the people at all to try and keep peace."
pers.6.a: "Send the loyalists to the Majlis."
pers.6.b: "Send the loyalists to capture key points in [266.GetName]."
pers.6.c: "Let's not stir up trouble."

pers.7.t: "Loyalists capture key points in the city"
pers.7.d: "People loyal to the Shah have successfully captured key parts of [266.GetName]. The police and the army have stopped any rebellion from taking place. However, there are still some politicians that refuse to accept stronger rule from the Shah. These politicians are loyal to the Majlis, not the Shah. Do we allow these politicians to remain free, giving them the opportunity to unify against the Shah? However, we could temporarily arrest these politicians to prevent an uprising."
pers.7.a: "Temporarily arrest them to secure power."
pers.7.b: "Let them do what they want."

pers.8.t: "Constitutional Monarchy remain"
pers.8.d: "With power to the Shah secure and the Majli loyal to him, a stable government has been created under the new Shah of [PER.GetNameDef], Hassan Mirza."
pers.8.a: "Long Live the Shah!"

pers.10.t: "Democrats and Socialists Combine Forces"
pers.10.d: "Forces from multiple political party, mostly from the Democrat party and members of the banned Edalat party, have unified against loyalist forces. Forces loyal to the Shah have failed to secure control, and a full revolution is imminent."
pers.10.a: "Damn..."

pers.11.t: "Politicians are ready to fight Hassan Mirza"
pers.11.d: "It is not a surprise to anyone that Hassan Mirza is trying to secure more power for the Qajars. The death of Ahmad was the perfect opportunity that Hassan Mirza was waiting for. However, politicians knew this was coming, and are prepared for it. Forces have been gathered, and they are ready to fight. This could lead to a civil war. However, there is also the opportunity to assassinate Hassan Mirza, which could lead to a more peaceful transition of power."
pers.11.a: "Let the fight for [PER.GetNameDef] begin!"
pers.11.b: "Assassinate Mirza."

pers.12.t: "Hassan Mirza remains peaceful"
pers.12.d: "Hassan Mirza has surprised everyone by staying peaceful in this opportunity. Many people thought that given the death of his brother, Mirza would try to create an absolute monarchy for the Qajars. However, Mirza has not ordered his troops to do anything, claiming that he wants to keep a peaceful transition of power. Now, it seems things have settled since the death of Ahmad, and people are preparing for the coronation of Hassan Mirza as the new Shah."
pers.12.a: "What a wise man Mirza is."

pers.14.t: "Mirza gives no commands and leaves"
pers.14.d: "Hassan Mirza gave his men no orders before fleeing into hiding. This means that the loyalist forces have no direction, no central commands. This gives rebels the opportunity to gather their forces."
pers.14.a: "Could the Qajars lose their power?"

pers.15.t: "Politicians are ready to fight Hassan Mirza"
pers.15.d: "It is not a surprise to anyone that Hassan Mirza is trying to secure more power for the Qajars. The death of Ahmad was the perfect opportunity that Hassan Mirza was waiting for. However, politicians knew this was coming, and are prepared for it. Forces have been gathered, and they are ready to fight. It appears the cities are breaking out into civil war."
pers.15.a: "Let the fight for [PER.GetNameDef] begin!"

pers.16.t: "Hassan Mirza has been assassinated!"
pers.16.d: "A group of socialist rebels have successfully assassinated Hassan Mirza using a bomb while he was speaking to some of his officers. This is a great blow to the loyalists and the Qajar Dynasty. However, Hassan Mirza had a son, Soltan Hamid Mirza, who will now take the reins to try and resume stability. Currently, there are two options. The politicians have said that they are willing to negotiate with us for a peaceful transition. However, we could also ignore any negotiations, but this would tip the nation over the edge to civil war."
pers.16.a: "We will fight for [PER.GetNameDef]!"
pers.16.b: "We should negotiate for peace in [PER.GetNameDef]"

pers.17.t: "Revolution!"
pers.17.d: "The people of [PER.GetNameDef] have decided; the royal system is over! A majority of the Qajars and their loyalists have gone into hiding or have been exiled from the country. An emergency meeting in the Majlis has been called to decide on the system of [PER.GetNameDef]'s government. Either we could form a fully democratic republic under the Democrat party, that previously ruled in together with the Shah, with elections every 4 years. Our other option is to bring in the socialist Edalat party. The party had been banned since the failed assassination attempt on Ahmad Shah but continued to have wide support across [PER.GetNameDef]."
pers.17.a: "The Democrats will form a republic."
pers.17.b: "Edalat will form a socialist republic."

pers.18.t: "Democrats form government"
pers.18.d: "It has been decided. The Democrat party has formed a democratic government and parliament. Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh has become the first President of the new Republic of Iran."
pers.18.a: "Democracy prevails!"

pers.19.t: "Socialists form government"
pers.19.d: "It has been decided. The Edalat party has formed a socialist government under Iraj Eskandari as president. The peasants of [PER.GetNameDef] rejoice as Eskandari gives his first speech, speaking of plans to give workers and their unions more power and to redistribute the wealth to the poor."
pers.19.a: "A victory for the workers."

pers.20.t: "Civil War in the cities!"
pers.20.d: "Everyone knew that civil war was a possibility in our disunified nation. Fighting has erupted in the major cities, with clashes between socialists, republicans and Qajar loyalists breaking out. However, it seems our disunity has been somewhat of a benefit, for outside the cities, most people do not care enough about their government to fight for it. This means that the fighting is fully contained in the cities. It will be a bloody fight going forward, and whoever comes out victorious will unify [PER.GetNameDef] under their government, and the losers will no doubt be stripped of any influence."
pers.20.a: "Let the best party win."

pers.21.t: "The fight for Isfahan"
pers.21.d: "Isfahan, once the capital of Safavid empire, is considered one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s most beautiful cities and has many historical sites. It is so popular that some refer to it as "Isfahan, half of the world". In the past few days since Shah Ahmad Qajar's death, pro-Hassan Mirza forces have managed to seize important locations around the city, like the Chehel Sotun palace and Naghsh-e Jahan Square, in order to stop any sort of resistance from anti-monarchist groups. Meanwhile, a small group of rebels who were preparing to strike the city have managed to capture the bridges on Zayandeh Rud river and destroyed them, except the famous Safavid bridges of Si o Se Pol and Khaju, effectively cutting the royalists out of the southern part of the city."
pers.21.a: "Loyalist forces must push, even if it's dangerous."
pers.21.b: "The loyalists will try to encircle the rebels by rowing to the other side."

pers.22.t: "The fight for Tabriz"
pers.22.d: "Tabriz, one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s historical cities, dating back to the Sassanid era and gaining importance as the capital of [PER.GetNameDef] during the Ilkhanate era and the Safavids at their rise and an important economic centre throughout [PER.GetNameDef]'s history, has been eerily silent for the last couple of days. Just a few days ago with the death of Ahmad Shah Qajar, the revolutionaries present in the city, much like 1908's constitutional revolution, began to take control of the city. In a fast swoop of the important locations, including Constitution house of Tabriz, Tabriz Grand Bazaar and Kabud mosque, they manage to almost capture the entirety of the city. While those loyal to Hassan Mirza were surprised by the Tabrizi Revolutionaries, they managed to secure the Arg-e Alishah Mausoleum as it proved a good location to holdout against revolutionary forces, as was proven by Russians who took control of Tabriz in 1911."
pers.22.a: "The Revolutionaries storm the Arg-e Alishah in order to defeat the royalists."
pers.22.b: "The rebels delay the attack to negotiate peace terms with their commanding officer."

pers.24.t: "The fight for Mashhad"
pers.24.d: "The Holiest city for Shias in [PER.GetNameDef], the resting place of the Shia 8th Imam Reza, is currently in a state of war, ever since the Shah died. Revolutionaries, having a small foothold in the city, have barely managed to hold their ground against the high concentration of royalist forces, so they have resorted to guerilla warfare and damaging government buildings, attacking royalist patrols, and blowing supply caches. However, this most likely will not be successful."
pers.24.a: "The rebels are soon rooted out by loyal citizens."

pers.26.t: "The fight for Shiraz"
pers.26.d: "Shiraz is probably one of the oldest [PER.GetAdjective] cities to exist, dating back to the Achaemenid Empire and its foundation. Being one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s cultural capitals throughout history, Shiraz has an important role in [PER.GetNameDef]'s identity and political affairs. In the past couple of days since the death of the Shah, the revolutionary forces have managed to take control of different points around the city with minimum damage to famous historical and cultural sites, such as famous poets Hafez Shirazi and Sa'di's resting place alongside the Shah Cheragh Mosque, the Quran gate and the famous Zand Dynasty fortress titled Arg of Karim Khan. While the revolutionary forces have managed to take control of most of the city the Qashqai tribesmen, loyal to the Shah, are moving in to capture Shiraz and might bring the city to loyalist control. Unbeknownst to the Qashqai tribe, the Revolutionary Bakhtiari tribe, who have always been in favour of the constitutionalists and participated in the 1907 constitutional revolution dispatched a huge force to help out the revolutionaries. If they get there in time they might just be able to tip the balance in favour of the defending revolutionaries..."
pers.26.a: "The Qashqai tribe hasten their march to Shiraz in order to reinforce the rebels in the city."
pers.26.b: "The Qashqai tribe launch an early offensive that could bring the city to their control."

pers.27.t: "The fight for Bandar e'Abbas"
pers.27.d: "Bandar e'Abbas is one the most important trade cities of [PER.GetNameDef]. Due to its port and key location in the Persian gulf, historically the city has been a centre of trade for foreign merchants and a location where most [PER.GetAdjective] exports take place. The port city of Bandar e'Abbas for the past few days has witnessed heavy fighting between the supporters of Hassan Mirza and Revolutionaries. Although the city was initially well guarded by Qajar supporters, due to its importance, Edalat party members had been secretly importing foreign socialists into the city in order to fight the Qajar soldiers when the time was right. As soon as the news of Ahmad Shah's death spread, Qajar forces began to fortify important parts of the city, especially the port, putting it on lockdown until further notice. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries alongside the foreign fighters began to strike the weaker Qajar positions when they least expected it. In a few hours the smaller Qajar outposts had been wiped out entirely, and when the news reached the Qajar forces it was too late for them do anything, but to fortify the last few major posts they held. Due to infrastructure problems, no reinforcements will get to the city in time."
pers.27.a: "The revolutionaries attack the last fortified outposts and claim the city for themselves."

pers.28.t: "End of the fighting"
pers.28.d: "It appears the fighting has begun to slow down. Hundreds of people were killed, both willing fighters and innocent civilians. Families have been torn apart over political beliefs, but order has somewhat been restored."
pers.28.a: "And the winner is..."

pers.29.t: "Loyalists come out victorious"
pers.29.d: "As the dust settles, it appears the Qajar loyalists have come out of the fighting victorious. Any remaining rebels who refuse to accept the new government are being arrested to ensure stability."
pers.29.a: "As it should be."

pers.30.t: "Rebels come out victorious"
pers.30.d: "As the dust settles, it seems the anti-Qajar rebels, a union of republicans and socialists, have won in the cities and so gain control."
pers.30.a: "As it should be."

pers.31.t: "Black Monday hits [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.31.d: "The German economy has been growing ever since their victory in the Weltkrieg, and have strong economic links to [PER.GetNameDef]. Due to the size of their economy and our large oil reserves, our economy has more and more become dependent on Germany's. Since the Weltkrieg ended, our economy has been recovering quite rapidly, and the effects of the Persian Famine have almost been solved.\n\nHowever, crisis has struck Germany in the form of Black Monday. The whole German economy has crashed, creating waves affecting many other nations around the world, bringing their economies down with them. It seems one of those waves has hit us. Suddenly, thousands of people have lost all their money and their jobs, and families are going to be starving again. The leadership has met in an emergency meeting to figure out a plan to solve this."
pers.31.a: "Things can only get better..."

pers.32.t: "Wealth of the Astan Quds Razavi"
pers.32.d: "The Astan Quds Razavi is an autonomous charitable foundation based in [PER.GetNameDef], known as a Boyard. They look after estates, repairing and refurbishing old temples and other buildings, and even education orphan school children. They are a very popular and wealthy organisation, and even have influence inside our government. However, what we want to focus on is their vast amount of wealth. Seeing the effects of Black Monday on our citizens, the Astan Quds Razavi has agreed to give us some of their wealth to help deal with the problem. However, we have a second option. We could fully seize their wealth, giving us more money to work with for dealing with Black Monday. However, their is large support for Astan Quds Razavi, so seizing their wealth will lose us a lot of support from the public."
pers.32.a: "The deal is good enough."
pers.32.b: "Seize their wealth."

pers.33.t: "Wealth of Sheikh Khaz'al"
pers.33.d: "Khaz'al bin Jabir bin Merdaw al-Ka'bi is one of the wealthiest men in [PER.GetNameDef], if not the whole Middle East. Having had a share in the Anglo-[PER.GetAdjective] oil company and having received yearly tributes from the British Empire alongside his subjects in the province of Khuzestan, he became unimaginably wealthy and influential to a point where the province of Khuzestan was his personal kingdom. With the economic reforms under way we need a huge source of income and we believe Sheikh Khaz'al's wealth is the answer. If we can convince him to supply us with his wealth willingly we can prevent any unwanted hostilities. On the other hand, we can seize all his possessions which will entirely remove him as a threat in the future and also give us more supplies to work with. Although the consequences of such action will be severe."
pers.33.a: "We must try and convince him to supply us with his wealth."
pers.33.b: "It is time to get rid of Khaz'al. For too long his power has grown unchecked."

pers.34.t: "Remove the opposition?"
pers.34.d: "Ever since the revolution took place and the socialists seized the government, there has been one central question: whether we should work with the politicians of the previous government, or whether we should completely remove anyone from the previous government to complete the full revolution. The previous government, although having the Qajars be a strong force, was a Social democratic one, proving that the politicians are able to somewhat work with us. However, there is the chance that these reactionary forces, if kept in government, will try to corrupt and inevitably destroy the revolution. Although in the short term purging the government will have a dangerous effect, in the long run it might preserve the revolution permanently."
pers.34.a: "We must purge them, a clean slate for a new [PER.GetNameDef]!"
pers.34.b: "We must be better than the reactionaries."

pers.35.t: "Clergies call Jihad!"
pers.35.d: "With our nation under the threat of destruction, clergies all around [PER.GetNameDef], especially in Qom and Mashhad, have declared a Jihad. This will inspire our men to fight harder, and will surely lead to victory against the outside threat."
pers.35.a: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] fights on!"

pers.36.t: "End of Jihad"
pers.36.d: "With our nation at peace, clergies have announced that the Jihad is at an end. We have survived through war and gained victory!"
pers.36.a: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] lives in glory!"

pers.37.t: "Socialist Protests"
pers.37.d: "Hundreds of people have gathered in the streets, in protest against our current government. These people are part of the banned socialist 'Edalat' party, the main socialist organisation in [PER.GetNameDef]. Although it is illegal, it still has much support from our populace. These protests always end in violent clashes with the police, and every day more and more people are losing faith in our government. If we want these protests to stop, we must end the political chaos inside the government itself, and create order throughout the nation."
pers.37.a: "Someday, this violence might end."

pers.38.t: "1938 Presidential Election"
pers.38.d: "As we promised when we took power in the government, the first presidential election is taking place in [PER.GetNameDef], and there are many options for the people of [PER.GetNameDef] to choose from. Things are still very shaky, and people have still not fully recovered from the chaos after the death of Ahmad. First is a Democrat-Edalat coalition, with Taqizadeh becoming president. They have formed a coalition due to both of their leaders being close associates, and both working together during the revolution against the Shah. They have some similar views, so can work together fine for now. However, they do differ in many ways, and it will remain being a shaky alliance. The other main candidate is Mohammad Ali Foroughi Zoka-ol-Molk, leading an Tajadod-Eslah Talaban coalition. These parties have come together to try to reduce the influence of the Edalat and Democrat party, and disagree with them on almost every field. These parties can work together well, for the Eslah Talaban, having lost some popularity due to their alignment with the Shah, can implement their social policies, while the Tajadod party can implement their economic reforms."
pers.38.b: "Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh wins the vote."
pers.38.e: "Mohammad Ali Foroughi Zoka-ol-Molk wins the vote."

pers.39.t: "1942 Presidential Election"
pers.39.d: "Once again it is election time in [PER.GetNameDef], and things have calmed down a lot. First is Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh of the Democrat party. This time, there is no coalition with the Edalat party, due to tensions lowering politically. Taqizadeh believes in reforms to the economic system to help those who do not have much, like people who were affected by the famine. Second is Ahmad Qavam of the Eslah Talaban party. His beliefs are far more traditional, and believes that usually, less reform is more beneficial. These two parties have been in rivaly since the first constitutional revolution, and both wish to gain power in the new democratic state of [PER.GetNameDef]."
pers.39.b: "Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh wins the vote."
pers.39.f: "Ahmad Qavam wins the vote."

pers.40.t: "1946 Presidential Election"
pers.40.d: "Once again it is election time in [PER.GetNameDef], and there are many options to choose from. Firstly is a coalition between the Democrat party and the Edalat party under Taqizadeh. The Edalat party have lost a lot of popularity since the first election, but have formed a coalition with the Democrats to try and regain their influence. Second is a coalition between the Tajadod party and the Eetedaliun party under Mohammad Mosaddegh. Although they disagree somewhat on social policies, economically they can work together effectively. Both are not major parties, so they need eachothers combined popularity to win. Finally is the Eslah Talaban party. They have gained much popularity since the revolution, for many people believe that if there hadn't have been a revolution, there might not have been as many wars as there have been recently. Many people have died, and so more people turn to the Eslah Talaban party to solve this."
pers.40.b: "Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh wins the vote."
pers.40.c: "Mohammad Mosaddegh wins the vote."
pers.40.f: "Ahmad Qavam wins the vote."

pers.41.t: "1938 Majlis Election"
pers.41.d: "Since the constitutional monarchy was set up, the Majlis have been a major part of politics in [PER.GetNameDef]. Acting as the parliament of [PER.GetNameDef], they have strong power in the day to day lives of all [PER.GetAdjective]s. Now, the time has come to elect new people into the Majlis, and to assign new people to be ministers.\n\nThe first cabinet is a Democrat party cabinet. They were the party that were in power under the previous Shah, before his health got the better of him. They remain very popular throughout the country, having proven their ability previously. They plan to remain moderate and bring stability and unity to [PER.GetNameDef]. The second cabinet is a coalition of members of the Eslah Talaban party and more authoritarian ministers. They all believe more power should be given to the Shah, and believe the Shah losing power was the cause of the chaos after the death of Ahmad. They are still against full control from the Shah, but want him to take a more direct approach to politics. They also want to put a tighter leash on the political scene, having the military general Reza Khan as security minister. Finally is a coalition of many parties, of Democrats, Eetedaliun and Tajadod ministers. They generally agree with the idea of the constitutional monarchy, but still want the Shah to have less power. They may disagree on economic and social policies, but can band together to pass some small reforms."
pers.41.a: "Democrat party."
pers.41.b: "Right wing coalition."
pers.41.c: "Liberal coalition."

pers.42.t: "1942 Majlis Election"
pers.42.d: "It is time once again to assign new people to the Majlis, and things have calmed down a lot more, so parties are more open to implementing their own policies and agendas. First is a coalition between members of the Democrat party and the Tajadod party. They agree entirely on social issues, so can pass social reform easily. However, economically they differ wildly, but they would rather have power shared between them rather than with other parties. Second is a cabinet of Eslah Talaban party. They are more moderate, believing in traditional values and equal rule between the Shah and the Majlis, cooperating with the Shah closely. Finally is a coalition between members of the Tajadod party and more authoritarian ministers. The authoritarian ministers still want more power for the Shah, and are trying to achieve it in the Majlis through elections. The Tajadod have also changed their tactic, believing that a strong Shah will be beneficial for them, and will help them pass their reforms."
pers.42.a: "Democrat coalition."
pers.42.b: "Eslah Talaban party."
pers.42.c: "Right wing coalition."

pers.43.t: "1946 Majlis Election"
pers.43.d: "It is time once again to assign new people to the Majlis. First cabinet option is the Democrat party, who are now running independently. They have a very liberal agenda, and can now attempt to pass some social reform. Second is a cabinet of Eslah Talaban party. They are more moderate, believing in traditional values and equal rule between the Shah and the Majlis, cooperating with the Shah closely. Finally is a coalition between members of the Tajadod party and more authoritarian ministers. The authoritarian ministers still want more power for the Shah, and are trying to achieve it in the Majlis through elections. The Tajadod have also changed their tactic, believing that a strong Shah will be beneficial for them, and will help them pass their reforms."

pers.43.c: "Right wing coalition."

pers.44.t: "War with Azerbaijan"
pers.44.d: "In the northern state of Tebriz, there is a majority population of Azerbaijani Turks. This population gives us justification to reunite the Azerbaijani people under our flag. However, a nation on our border, Armenia, also has a bone to pick with Azerbaijan. We can approach Armenia with potential for a military alliance with them, and we can split the Azerbaijani territory for mutual benefit."
pers.44.a: "We don't need Armenia's help."
pers.44.b: "Approach Armenia."

pers.45.t: "[PER.GetAdjective] Aggression - who do we ask for help?"
pers.45.d: "Reports have come in of increasing [PER.GetAdjective] aggression on our borders, with potential to escalate to full blown war. The [PER.GetAdjective]s claim that they wish to unite the Azerbaijani people under one flag, but we see though those lies. This is just Iran trying to spread its influence further. Now, we cannot defend against [PER.GetNameDef] by ourselves. But, we can contact the Germans for a deal for defence."
pers.45.a: "Approach Germany."
pers.45.c: "We must go in alone."

pers.46.t: "Azerbaijan wants help from [PER.GetAdjective] aggression"
pers.46.d: "The Azerbaijan government has requested that we defend them when the [PER.GetAdjective]s declare war on them. The oil of the Baku oil fields fuels our tanks and cars, so Azerbaijan could be a good ally. However, if we threaten the [PER.GetAdjective]s, they might respond with letting us use their oil instead. If this happens, then we don't actually have to get involved in this issue. Or, we could just ignore this entirely."
pers.46.a: "Guarantee Azerbaijan."
pers.46.b: "Who cares about Azerbaijan?"

pers.47.t: "Germany Guarantees Azerbaijan"
pers.47.d: "There is an issue in the fact that the Germans have claimed they will defend Azerbaijan should we go to war with them. The might of the German army is something we do not want to experience. However, the main reason Germany even wants to protect Azerbaijan is for its oil. We also have large stockpiles of oil the Germans could use for their war machines. Therefore, we could send the Germans a deal to take our oil instead of the Azerbaijanis."
pers.47.a: "Send the oil deal."
pers.47.b: "We don't fear the Germans!"
pers.47.c: "Back off."

pers.48.t: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] Offers Oil for Azerbaijan"
pers.48.d: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] has sent us a deal, offering us trade of their oil stockpiles to end our guarantee of the Azerbaijanis. We should probably not get ourselves involved in a middle eastern war while we already have instability at home."
pers.48.a: "We got what we wanted, revoke guarantee."
pers.48.b: "Decline, we do not betray our allies."

pers.49.t: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] has backed down"
pers.49.d: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] has decided to back down on its aggression towards us. They have pulled out their troops from our border, and our security is assured. This is truly a day of celebration."
pers.49.a: "Rejoice!"

pers.50.t: "Germany took the oil deal"
pers.50.d: "The Germans have decided to use our oil instead of the Azerbaijani's and have revoked their guarantee of them. We no longer need to worry about the Germans, and will soon be getting more trade, boosting our economy."
pers.50.a: "Azerbaijan will be ours."

pers.51.t: "Germany keep guarantee"
pers.51.d: "Germany have denied any offer to remove their guarantee on Azerbaijan and claim they will continue to defend their ally. Maybe it is time for us to back off of our recent claims."
pers.51.a: "We fear no Europeans."
pers.51.b: "We cannot fight the Germans!"

pers.52.t: "Germany refused to help us"
pers.52.d: "Germany have refused to help us against [PER.GetAdjective] aggression. We cannot survive by ourselves. We can still approach the Ottomans for help."
pers.52.a: "Approach the Ottomans."
pers.52.b: "Go in alone."

pers.53.t: "Azerbaijan wants help from [PER.GetAdjective] aggression"
pers.53.d: "The Azerbaijanis have approached us for our assistance in their up and coming war against [PER.GetNameDef]. [PER.GetNameDefCap] has taken an aggressive stance against Azerbaijan, claiming to want to reunite the Azerbaijani people under the [PER.GetAdjective] flag. This is clearly just the [PER.GetAdjective]s trying to assert dominance in the Caucasus region, a region we have had strong with."
pers.53.a: "We won't let [PER.GetNameDef] expand further."
pers.53.b: "We have our own problems to deal with."

pers.54.t: "The Ottomans guarantee Azerbaijan"
pers.54.d: "The Ottomans have decided to guarantee Azerbaijan, trying to contain our 'aggression'. We cannot offer them oil, for they already have wide swathes of it. We have no option other than to either go to war anyway or forget the whole idea."
pers.54.a: "We can take them both!"
pers.54.b: "We must back off."

pers.55.t: "Nobody wants to help us"
pers.55.d: "We have approached the foreign power, and they have declined. We have no one left to turn to, so we must face the [PER.GetAdjective]s alone. We will fight as hard as we can!"
pers.55.a: "This can't be good..."

pers.56.t: "Azerbaijan stands alone"
pers.56.d: "We have our chance. Azerbaijan has tried to ask foreign powers for their help, and they have all refused. They understand our justification to unite Azerbaijan under the [PER.GetAdjective] flag, and we will do so!"
pers.56.a: "To war!"

pers.57.t: "The Ottomans refused to help us"
pers.57.d: "The Ottomans have refused to help us in the up and coming war against Iran. We cannot survive by ourselves, and only Germany is left to turn to."
pers.57.a: "Approach the Germans."
pers.57.b: "Go in alone."

pers.58.t: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] Offers Territory for Help"
pers.58.d: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with a deal. They plan on invading our neighbour Azerbaijan and have offered us some territory if we help. Together, we can easily take out Azerbaijan, and can get some territory in the process."
pers.58.a: "We agree to help."
pers.58.b: "We do not wish to get involved."

pers.59.t: "Armenia refuses our offer"
pers.59.d: "Armenia have refused our offer of an alliance. Foolish of them, we can deal with the Azerbaijanis ourselves. However, we do still have the option to forget about our plan and leave Azerbaijan as it is."
pers.59.a: "Continue with the plan."
pers.59.b: "Back off."

pers.60.t: "Armenia agree to the deal"
pers.60.d: "Armenia have agreed to enter a formal alliance with us to fight the Azerbaijanis. This will no doubt prove very helpful in the upcoming war and any future wars we have."
pers.60.a: "Together we are strong!"

pers.61.t: "Armenia cannot join our alliance"
pers.61.d: "Armenia cannot join our alliance in their current form, showing that they do not want to commit to this agreement. Plans for Azerbaijan will continue."
pers.61.a: "We can fight the Azerbaijanis without them."

pers.62.t: "The Armenian Question"
pers.62.d: "Armenia has always been a big question for the [PER.GetAdjective] people. They used to be a part of the Great Persian Empire, and so some say they should once again join us through force. However, we also have the opportunity to ally closer to them, connecting our economy more effectively to boost both of our economies."
pers.62.a: "Bring them back in, through force."
pers.62.b: "Open our economies."

pers.63.t: "Form socialist alliance with Bharatiya Commune?"
pers.63.d: "As one of the other main socialist nations of Asia, the Bharatiya Commune might agree to form an alliance of Asian socialist States, so that we may be able to split up the Dominion's land between us."
pers.63.a: "Together we will be strong!"

pers.64.t: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] Wants an Alliance"
pers.64.d: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with an idea of creating an alliance. We are both strong socialist states of Asia, and so the [PER.GetAdjective]s claim we should help each other to spread the revolution. Their first plan with us is to invade the Dominion, allowing us to take most of the land, with them only wanting Baluchistan."
pers.64.a: "Together we are strong!"
pers.64.b: "We cannot take the Dominion yet."

pers.65.t: "Bharatiya Commune agree to alliance"
pers.65.d: "The Bharatiya Commune have agreed to align with us in taking out the Delhi government. Now, it is time for war."
pers.65.a: "For Socialism!"

pers.66.t: "Bharatiya Commune refuse"
pers.66.d: "The Bharatiya Commune have refused our offer of creating a socialist Asian alliance. We can still go to war, but it would be risky."
pers.66.a: "We fight on!"
pers.66.b: "We cannot take them alone."

pers.67.t: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] demands Bahrain"
pers.67.d: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] has sent us an ultimatum, stating that we shall immediately give up the island of Bahrain to them. Their claim to Bahrain is hundreds of years old, but the [PER.GetAdjective] government still speak passionately about retaking 'lost land'. They say that if we do not cede the islands, they will have to take military action."
pers.67.a: "Give it up."
pers.67.b: "We do not fear [PER.GetNameDef]"

pers.68.t: "They cede Bahrain."
pers.68.d: "We are now finally the sole owners of Bahrain, as it always should have been."
pers.68.a: "Perfect."

pers.69.t: "They refuse our ultimatum"
pers.69.d: "They have refused to give us Bahrain. Our only option of getting the island back is war."
pers.69.a: "To war!"

pers.70.t: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] Demand Iraqi Lands"
pers.70.d: "[PER.GetNameDefCap], seeing our weakness, have taken the opportunity to demand our Iraqi territory from us. Iran has been trying to influence neighbouring nations more and more recently, trying to once again create their Empire. This is evidently just another attempt at expansion, but we might need to focus on other issues."
pers.70.a: "We do not fear [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.70.b: "We can't afford more problems."

pers.71.t: "The Ottomans give us Iraqi lands"
pers.71.d: "For years, the Iraqi lands have been under the cruel fist of the Ottomans. But now, in their time of weakness, they have made the correct choice and ceded us the Iraqi land."
pers.71.a: "Welcome to the new Empire!"

pers.72.t: "The Ottomans refuse"
pers.72.d: "The Ottomans have refused to give us their Iraqi lands. They are an important part of our previous lands, and with the weakness of the Ottomans, we can try and take it back."
pers.72.a: "We can take them!"
pers.72.b: "They are a pretty big Empire..."

pers.73.t: "The Annexation of Azerbaijan"
pers.73.d: "We have defeated Azerbaijan and should now decide what we will do with their land."
pers.73.a: "For [PER.GetAdjective] Greatness!"

pers.74.t: "The Liberation of Tajikistan"

pers.74.a: "Continue occupation."
pers.74.b: "Take Karakum, puppet the rest to Tajikistan."

pers.76.t: "Alliance with [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.76.d: "[PER.GetNameDefCap] has approached us with a deal. After invading the Dominion of India, they have offered us the rest of India other than the province of Baluchistan, for an alliance."
pers.76.a: "Agree to the deal."
pers.76.b: "We do not need [PER.GetNameDef]"

pers.77.t: "The Princely States accept"

pers.80.b: "We will push them to Moscow!"

pers.81.t: "Peace with [PER.GetNameDef]?"
pers.81.d: "The war with [PER.GetNameDef] has not gone at all in our favour. They have offered us a peace deal, with us losing much territory."

pers.88.t: "Peace with [PER.GetNameDef]?"
pers.88.d: "We have been at war with [PER.GetNameDef] to defend our ally, Azerbaijan. However, evidently this has not worked. We should probably just make peace with them."

pers.88.b: "Never!"

pers.89.t: "Dehkhoda's Dictionary"
pers.89.d: "With the rise of nationalist and separatist movements all around the world, a united and unified [PER.GetNameDef] is needed. Recently we have discovered the efforts of Ali Akbar Dehkhoda, a prominent [PER.GetAdjective] linguist, on making the first ever Farsi dictionary. We can use this opportunity to further educate our people and, in the process, strengthen our unity."

Recently Ernst Emil Herzfield, a German archaeologist and historian, excavated Persepolis' ruins. Recently he has asked for permission to renew his excavation of Persepolis. It is up to us to decide what to do with his request."
pers.90.a: "Allow the excavation, but heavily regulate it to protect the site from theft and vandalism."

pers.91.t: "Muharram"
pers.91.d: "Today marks the start of Muharram, first month of the Islamic calendar, a month of grief for Shias in [PER.GetNameDef]. In this month, Imam husein, the third Shia Imam was martyred and the events leading to his martyrdom are still fresh in the memories of Shias in [PER.GetNameDef]."

pers.92.a: "We mourn him."

pers.93.t: "The Qajar Dynasty"
pers.93.d: "The Qajar dynasty, claiming descent from the Oghuz Turks settling in the northwest of the Iranian plateau, have been active in [PER.GetAdjective] affairs for centuries. They went from forming the Qizilbash with numerous other turkic and non-turkic tribes and serving under the Safavid Empire, what most would call the Fourth Persian Empire, to taking the reins of [PER.GetNameDef] as its Shahanshahs in 1796. Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar, the first Qajar Shahanshah of [PER.GetNameDef], took control after eliminating his political rivals in the aftermath of the fall of Nader Shah Afshar and his dynasty. Seeing the political situation unstable and the nation disintegrated once again into numerous independent kingdoms, Muhammad set out to reunify [PER.GetNameDef] under his own banner. It has been years since the day Muhammad reunified [PER.GetNameDef], and the Qajar dynasty has ever since been in decline. First it lost its Georgian territory, then Transoxiana and the rest of Caucasia to the Russians. Then the dagger that was the British Empire struck the heart of Qajar dynasty, bringing the end to [PER.GetAdjective] rule in Afghanistan and Baluchistan. Weaker by the day, the Qajars had no choice but to appease the Russians and British with oil. But, with appeasement comes corruption and treason, which the nation is rife with.\n\nWith the fall of the Russian and British empires in the events following after the Weltkrieg, it is time for the Qajar dynasty to finally find its place in the sun, or be left behind in the sand."
pers.93.a: "The Lion Will Roar Again!"

pers.97.t: "Ramadan"
pers.97.d: "Today is the beginning of the ninth Islamic month, Ramadan. A month of fasting and prayer for the muslims all around the world, going back to the first days of the rise of Islam.

pers.98.d: "Today is the beginning of the ninth Islamic month, Ramadan. A month of fasting and prayer for the muslims all around the world, going back to the first days of the rise of Islam.

pers.99.t: "Yalda Night"
pers.99.d: "Today, 30th of Azar, the last day of the ninth month of the [PER.GetAdjective] calendar, marks the Yalda celebration. The longest and darkest night of the year which is the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is the night where Iranic people gather together and their families to eat, drink and read poetry. Dating back to the beginnings of the Zoroastrian faith, Yalda is almost as important as Nowruz to all Iranic people."
pers.99.a: "Happy Yalda Night!"

pers.100.t: "Yalda Night"
pers.100.d: "Today, 30th of Azar, the last day of the ninth month of the [PER.GetAdjective] calendar, marks the Yalda celebration. The longest and darkest night of the year which is the winter solstice in the northern hemisphere is the night where Iranic people gather together and their families to eat, drink and read poetry.

pers.100.a: "Happy Yalda Night!"

pers.101.t: "Bear found by soldiers"
pers.101.d: "Recently, a bear cub was found by one of our officers in [266.GetName]'s nearby fortifications. While initially we had planned to take away the bear due to military regulations, we have begun to reconsider, as troops stationed in the fort have petitioned for it to stay. We have decided to allow the bear to stay at the fort for the time being to increase moral. The troops have decided to name him Rostam."
pers.101.a: "What a peculiar occurrence."

pers.102.t: "Rostam the bear"
pers.102.d: "Rostam the bear has been growing up alongside our army pretty well. Due to his owner being transferred to the 2nd Artillery supply company, Rostam was transferred to the company and has ever since been befriending its troops. They have taken the bear as their own mascot and it even helps them with carrying their artillery."
pers.102.a: "Truly a bizarre occurrence in the history of the [PER.GetAdjective] army."

pers.103.t: "Problems with Rostam"
pers.103.d: "Sadly, due to financial problems, the owner of Rostam is looking to sell him to the highest bidder. This will no doubt cause a loss of moral for the 2nd Artillery supply company. Several high ranking generals have began discussing the situation and we must decide what to do."
pers.103.a: "We have more important matters than a silly bear!"
pers.103.b: "We must purchase Rostam!"

pers.104.t: "Rostam has been sold"
pers.104.d: "Rostam the bear was sold to a Polish merchant passing through [PER.GetNameDef]. It seems the Polish merchant caravan was deeply amused by the military bear and as soon as they found out he was up for sale they purchased him. They have even began to call him a new name, Wojtek."
pers.104.a: "Alas, Wojtek's fate shall take him to Poland."

PER_core_afghan_land_desc: "Now that we have gained control of our lands in Afghanistan again, we can begin to integrate it into [PER.GetNameDef]. However, it is going to take decades to fully intergrate the eastern area due to their Pashtun ethnic majority. In the west of Afghanistan, the population is majority Hazara, a group we can more easily integrate into our nation. The Pashtuns most likely will resist our attempts, but eventually they will accept our leadership."
PER_core_azerbaijani_land: "Intergrate Azerbaijan"
PER_core_azerbaijani_land_desc: "Azerbaijan is now under our direct rule again. After some time, most Azerbaijanis will give up on their dream of their own state, and will accept our leadership. Although there will be some resistance to our rule, we have a very large Azerbaijani minority, and the nation of Azerbaijan only existed for a few decades. Therefore, Azerbaijani resistance will be weak and futile."
PER_core_baluchistan: "Integrate Baluchistan"
PER_core_baluchistan_desc: "The state of Baluchistan has been returned to our control. The Baluchi people are a large ethnic group in our nation, so we should be able to integrate the Baluchi population fully into our state.

### Ideas ###



### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_SAYYED_HASAN_TAQIZADEH_DESC:0 "Taqizādeh, despite being known as one of the biggest and most influential advocates for modernisation and constitutionalism, came from a family of clergymen who were descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, and it had seemed that he would follow in the footsteps of his family. However, his interest and experience with Western democracy and modern enlightenment caused him to follow a new career into politics, where he soon became a strong advocate against the Qajars and for sweeping reforms to the nation in order for it to flourish in the 20th century. With the revolution that has swept the nation, and the deposition of the Qajars, Taqizādeh has formed a new government that will seek to recreate Iran as a nation of true democracy and prosperity."
POLITICS_IRAJ_ESKANDARI_DESC:0 "As a Qajar Prince, Eskandari was given an education in France where he was exposed to the young syndicalist nation and its socialist teachings, to which he had soon begun to admire. He would link up with other Iranian socialists in the country, and even some of the key figures of the Revolutionary Republican Party of Iran who had been forced to flee after Ahmad Shah's attempted assassination, and the subsequent crackdown of socialism. Though he was unable to return home, he would slowly become one of the more popular figures of socialism in Iran, especially as the movement would begin to see greater popularity amongst the workers and peasants of Iran. With the Revolutionary Republican Party of Iran now in power, Eskandari has been appointed as President of the new Socialist Republic, promising greater freedoms for peasants and unions, and the redistribution of wealth to the common people."

### Events ###

pers.1.t:0 "The Republic of Iran,1936"
pers.1.d:0 "The Republic of Iran is the remnant and successor of what was the Qajar government, based in Tehran and still maintaining its control over the Eastern regions of Iran - including the city of Qom, Mashhad, and Kerman. Having emerged from the ‘Mostaghelun’ with the loss of its Western borders, the nation had only managed to stabilize by scrambling together a provisional government and the first republican cabinet in Iran, electing the acclaimed Mohammad Ali Foroughi as the first and current President of the first Republic of Iran. During the first years after the war, there was a focus on consolidating what territories were left of the nation, therefore the government and Majlis was made up of a wide variety of parties, majority of whom being members of the Iranian Intelligentsia, old Constitutionalist leaders, and nationalists.\n\nNot only does the nation contain the remnants of the previous government of Iran, but also its military, who had retreated from Azerbaijan and the Zagros Mountains at the signing of the Jaraj Treaty.\n\nTo head the army was none other than Reza Khan, who had personally led the Tabriz Battalion in the North-West. Despite his inability to quell the Azeri-Kurdish rebels, his performance in eliminating the Jangalis and their leader Mirza Kuchak Khan had gained him much popularity amongst the people and other military officers as a loyal patriot. As a result, he was promoted to field marshal of Iran, head of military affairs, and what is essentially complete control over the armies of Iran.""

### Decisions ###

PER_coring_conquered_territory:0 "Integration of New Territory"
PER_core_afghan_land:0 "Integrate Afghanistan"
PER_core_afghan_land_desc:0 "Now that we have gained control of our lands in Afghanistan again, we can begin to integrate it into [PER.GetNameDef]. However, it is going to take decades to fully integrate the eastern area due to their Pashtun ethnic majority. In the west of Afghanistan, the population is majority Hazara, a group we can more easily integrate into our nation. The Pashtuns most likely will resist our attempts, but eventually they will accept our leadership."
PER_core_turkestan:0 "Integrate Turkestan"
PER_core_turkestan_desc:0 "As our state moved further North we have come into the possession of the various steppe lands inhabited by the people of Turkestan, some being our close relatives. It is time to begin the process of integrating their population into our administration."
PER_core_azerbaijani_land:0 "Integrate Azerbaijan"
PER_core_azerbaijani_land_desc:0 "Azerbaijan is now under our direct rule again. After some time, most Azerbaijanis will give up on their dream of their own state, and will accept our leadership. Although there will be some resistance to our rule, we have a very large Azerbaijani minority, and the nation of Azerbaijan only existed for a few decades. Therefore, Azerbaijani resistance will be weak and futile."
PER_core_armenian_land:0 "Integrate Armenia"
PER_core_armenian_land_desc:0 "The people of Armenia have been struggling under foreign occupation for centuries, but just as the activist Gregory Yeghikian showed, they are part of the greater Pan-Iranian family. Let us welcome our long-lost brothers back into their destined state."
PER_core_georgian_land:0 "Integrate Georgia"
PER_core_georgian_land_desc:0 "While the ancient land of Kartli may have been one of the least integrated provinces of the old Persian Empires, it was nonetheless a vital part of our domain, especially during our struggles against the Greeks and Romans. We must establish permanent administration in Georgia."
PER_core_baluchistan:0 "Integrate Baluchistan"
PER_core_baluchistan_desc:0 "The state of Baluchistan has been returned to our control. The Baluchi people are a large ethnic group in our nation, so we should be able to integrate the Baluchi population fully into our state. However, they will resist our rule, due to the fact that they have been under Indian control for much time."
PER_core_gulf_land:0 "Integrate the Gulf States"
PER_core_gulf_land_desc:0 "The lands of the Persian Gulf, previously occupied by Arabic invaders, have been liberated by our armies. While the process of integrating these mercantile and sea-faring people is not out of the question, it will still take us some time to accomplish."
PER_core_arab_land:0 "Integrate Iraq-i-Arab"
PER_core_arab_land_desc:0 "With the acquisition of our ancient lands to the West, we can finally reestablish our zone of control in the bountiful lands of the Tigris–Euphrates river system."
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_category:0 "Western Expansion"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision:0 "The Ottomans are weak!"
PER_ottos_are_weak_decision_decfision_desc:0 "Recently, Egypt has declared war on the Ottoman Empire. The Ottomans have been dominating the Middle East for centuries, and now it is our moment to seek revenge. They have been showing weakness since even before the beginning of the Weltkrieg, and now it is our time to put an end to the sick man that is the Ottomans."
PER_country_namechange_decision:0 "Change our name to Iran"
PER_country_namechange_decision_desc:0 "Pressure is mounting from modernizing elements within our nation to push for the international community to refer to us as "Iran", the name we use for ourselves, over the outdated exonym "Persia". Exactly why this is a matter of such debate, we're not really sure."

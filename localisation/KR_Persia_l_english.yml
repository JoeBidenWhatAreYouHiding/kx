### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_AHMAD_SHAH_QAJAR_DESC:0 "Installed as Shah of Iran at the age of eleven, it could be argued that Ahmad Shah was always at the whim of the Majilis, only a figurehead in a nation still struggling with the aftermath of the events of the 1920's and beforehand. Though he would attempt to repair and unite the nation, his efforts would almost always collapse. Though the most turbulent part of his reign is arguably at an end, that does not mean there are not those wishing to see the Shah removed - whether it be Democrats who wish to establish a republic, Royalists who want install a new monarch that can surpass Ahmad Shah's abilities, or even Socialists who want to bring about a socialist revolution akin to the one declared in 1920. It seems, with all these enemies against the Shah, and his health in steady decline, that it is only a matter of time before chaos erupts across the nation."
POLITICS_HASSAN_MIRZA_QAJAR_DESC:0 "As the Crown-Prince of Iran, Hassan Mirza lived in his older brother’s shadow ever since he was installed as Shah, and had little influence in the politics of Iran during the early years of Ahmad Shah’s rule. From a young age, he would be exposed to the countless conflicts and civil uprisings that plagued the nation, from the Jangali Uprising to foreign intervention from the British and Russia, all the while his brother would seemingly do little to stop it all.  Over many years however, he would slowly build up the political, military, and diplomatic connections he desired, and attained the respect that was fit for the brother and heir of the Shah. Now, with his ascension to the Sun Throne, he has reached the very top of the Iranian political world, and it is certain he will not squander the opportunity to bring Iran into the modern age as a force to be reckoned with."
POLITICS_SAYYED_HASAN_TAQIZADEH_DESC:0 "Taqizadeh, despite being known as one of the biggest and most influential advocates for modernisation and constitutionalism, came from a family of clergymen who were descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, and it had seemed that he would follow in the footsteps of his family. However, his interest and experience with Western democracy and modern enlightenment caused him to follow a new career into politics, where he soon became a strong advocate against the Qajars and for sweeping reforms to the nation in order for it to flourish in the 20th century. With the revolution that has swept the nation, and the deposition of the Qajars, Taqizadeh has formed a new government that will seek to recreate Iran as a nation of true democracy and prosperity."
POLITICS_IRAJ_ESKANDARI_DESC:0 "As a Qajar Prince, Eskandari was given an education in France where he was exposed to the young syndicalist nation and its socialist teachings, to which he had soon begun to admire. He would link up with other Iranian socialists in the country, and even some of the key figures of the Edalat Party who had been forced to flee after Ahmad Shah's attempted assassination, and the subsequent crackdown of socialism. Though he was unable to return home, he would slowly become one of the more popular figures of socialism in Iran, especially as the movement would begin to see greater popularity amongst the workers and peasants of Iran. With the Edalat Party now in power, Eskandari has been appointed as President of the new Socialist Republic, promising greater freedoms for peasants and unions, and the redistribution of wealth to the common people."

pers.1.t:0 "Introduction to [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.1.d:0 "In the past few decades, [PER.GetNameDef] has been in a state of constant change and instability. Having gained full independence from Russia and the British Empire, we have struggled to find our own place in this world. All around [PER.GetNameDef], from the smallest hamlet in the furthest corners of the nation to the big cities like [266.GetName], we can see the difference in beliefs between the people. Just a few years ago, the Shah himself was shot by a socialist assassin. Although he survived, the Shah's health has been declining by the day. It is clear the nation cannot survive like it is, and with the Shah's death looming, there are fears ideological divide could turn into open revolt. Democrats trying to force a republic, royalists who would support a powerful monarchy lead by the Shah's brother, Hassan Mirza, and socialists, attempting to create the first socialist state in the Middle East. We can only hope the power transition is peaceful...\n\nOur nation's military is in shambles, and we are still recovering from a famine that killed millions of our people. Not only that, our political class is dominated by a corrupt aristocracy, ruining our political legitimacy. Our nation has many problems to sort out, but if we can do it successfully, we could become the greatest Empire the Middle East has ever seen."
pers.1.a:0 "[PER.GetNameDefCap] will be strong!"

pers.2.t:0 "The Shah is Dead!"
pers.2.d:0 "Reports this morning have come in informing us about the passing of Ahmad Shah Qajar. After he was shot in an assassination attempt by a socialist a few years ago, his health was poor, and it seems that this, combined with the increasing stress of ruling the nation, has lead to his death. Hassan Mirza, Ahmad's brother and heir to the Sun Throne, has taken power, but a power struggle has already begun among the many factions in [PER.GetNameDef]. Mirza himself has greater ambitions for the Qajar Dynasty, bringing suspicion from politicians in the Majlis. The socialists, a group that has been banned for many years, may try and rear its head at the sight of potential power.\n\nCurrently, the only question is whether Hassan Mirza stays in the country, or flees for his safety."
pers.2.a:0 "Mirza will stay in [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.2.b:0 "Mirza flees."

pers.3.t:0 "Loyalists storm Majlis"
pers.3.d:0 "People loyal to the Qajar Dynasty have stormed the Majlis under the command of Hassan Mirza, to try and eliminate potential threats. After all was done, many politicians were arrested to secure a safe transition in government. The Majlis have been closed until further notice."
pers.3.a:0 "Power to the Shah!"

pers.4.t:0 "Absolute Monarchy formed"
pers.4.d:0 "The monarchy has seized full power in [PER.GetNameDef]. No longer will we have to worry about petty things like democracy or liberty, for they are not needed anymore."
pers.4.a:0 "Long Live the Shah!"

pers.5.t:0 "What happens now?"
pers.5.d:0 "Mirza has decided to stay in [PER.GetNameDef]. There are many people loyal to him, willing to fight for him. We could command these people to storm the Majlis to keep order and capture any potential threats. We could also send these people to capture key points in [266.GetName] to try and secure power. However, Hassan Mirza could also not command the people at all to try and keep peace."
pers.5.a:0 "Send the loyalists to the Majlis."
pers.5.b:0 "Send the loyalists to capture key points in [266.GetName]."
pers.5.c:0 "Let's not stir up trouble."

pers.6.t:0 "What happens now?"
pers.6.d:0 "Although Hassan Mirza has decided to flee [PER.GetNameDef], there are many people still loyal to him, willing to fight. We could command these people to storm the Majlis to keep order and capture any potential threats. We could also send these people to capture key points in [266.GetName] to try and secure power. However, Hassan Mirza could also not command the people at all to try and keep peace."
pers.6.a:0 "Send the loyalists to the Majlis."
pers.6.b:0 "Send the loyalists to capture key points in [266.GetName]."
pers.6.c:0 "Let's not stir up trouble."

pers.7.t:0 "Loyalists capture key points in the city"
pers.7.d:0 "People loyal to the Shah have successfully captured key parts of [266.GetName]. The police and the army have stopped any rebellion from taking place. However, there are still some politicians that refuse to accept stronger rule from the Shah. These politicians are loyal to the Majlis, not the Shah. Do we allow these politicians to remain free, giving them the opportunity to unify against the Shah? However, we could temporarily arrest these politicians to prevent an uprising."
pers.7.a:0 "Temporarily arrest them to secure power."
pers.7.b:0 "Let them do what they want."

pers.8.t:0 "Constitutional Monarchy remain"
pers.8.d:0 "With power to the Shah secure and the Majli loyal to him, a stable government has been created under the new Shah of [PER.GetNameDef], Hassan Mirza."
pers.8.a:0 "Long Live the Shah!"

pers.10.t:0 "Democrats and Socialists Combine Forces"
pers.10.d:0 "Forces from multiple political party, mostly from the Democrat party and members of the banned Edalat party, have unified against loyalist forces. Forces loyal to the Shah have failed to secure control, and a full revolution is imminent."
pers.10.a:0 "Damn..."

pers.11.t:0 "Politicians are ready to fight Hassan Mirza"
pers.11.d:0 "It is not a surprise to anyone that Hassan Mirza is trying to secure more power for the Qajars. The death of Ahmad was the perfect opportunity that Hassan Mirza was waiting for. However, politicians knew this was coming, and are prepared for it. Forces have been gathered, and they are ready to fight. This could lead to a civil war. However, there is also the opportunity to assassinate Hassan Mirza, which could lead to a more peaceful transition of power."
pers.11.a:0 "Let the fight for [PER.GetNameDef] begin!"
pers.11.b:0 "Assassinate Mirza."

pers.12.t:0 "Hassan Mirza remains peaceful"
pers.12.d:0 "Hassan Mirza has surprised everyone by staying peaceful in this opportunity. Many people thought that given the death of his brother, Mirza would try to create an absolute monarchy for the Qajars. However, Mirza has not ordered his troops to do anything, claiming that he wants to keep a peaceful transition of power. Now, it seems things have settled since the death of Ahmad, and people are preparing for the coronation of Hassan Mirza as the new Shah."
pers.12.a:0 "What a wise man Mirza is."

pers.14.t:0 "Mirza gives no commands and leaves"
pers.14.d:0 "Hassan Mirza gave his men no orders before fleeing into hiding. This means that the loyalist forces have no direction, no central commands. This gives rebels the opportunity to gather their forces."
pers.14.a:0 "Could the Qajars lose their power?"

pers.15.t:0 "Politicians are ready to fight Hassan Mirza"
pers.15.d:0 "It is not a surprise to anyone that Hassan Mirza is trying to secure more power for the Qajars. The death of Ahmad was the perfect opportunity that Hassan Mirza was waiting for. However, politicians knew this was coming, and are prepared for it. Forces have been gathered, and they are ready to fight. It appears the cities are breaking out into civil war."
pers.15.a:0 "Let the fight for [PER.GetNameDef] begin!"

pers.16.t:0 "Hassan Mirza has been assassinated!"
pers.16.d:0 "A group of socialist rebels have successfully assassinated Hassan Mirza using a bomb while he was speaking to some of his officers. This is a great blow to the loyalists and the Qajar Dynasty. However, Hassan Mirza had a son, Soltan Hamid Mirza, who will now take the reins to try and resume stability. Currently, there are two options. The politicians have said that they are willing to negotiate with us for a peaceful transition. However, we could also ignore any negotiations, but this would tip the nation over the edge to civil war."
pers.16.a:0 "We will fight for [PER.GetNameDef]!"
pers.16.b:0 "We should negotiate for peace in [PER.GetNameDef]"

pers.17.t:0 "Revolution!"
pers.17.d:0 "The people of [PER.GetNameDef] have decided; the royal system is over! A majority of the Qajars and their loyalists have gone into hiding or have been exiled from the country. An emergency meeting in the Majlis has been called to decide on the system of [PER.GetNameDef]'s government. Either we could form a fully democratic republic under the Democrat party, that previously ruled in together with the Shah, with elections every 4 years. Our other option is to bring in the socialist Edalat party. The party had been banned since the failed assassination attempt on Ahmad Shah but continued to have wide support across [PER.GetNameDef]."
pers.17.a:0 "The Democrats will form a republic."
pers.17.b:0 "Edalat will form a socialist republic."

pers.18.t:0 "Democrats form government"
pers.18.d:0 "It has been decided. The Democrat party has formed a democratic government and parliament. Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh has become the first President of the new Republic of Iran."
pers.18.a:0 "Democracy prevails!"

pers.19.t:0 "Socialists form government"
pers.19.d:0 "It has been decided. The Edalat party has formed a socialist government under Iraj Eskandari as president. The peasants of [PER.GetNameDef] rejoice as Eskandari gives his first speech, speaking of plans to give workers and their unions more power and to redistribute the wealth to the poor."
pers.19.a:0 "A victory for the workers."

pers.20.t:0 "Civil War in the cities!"
pers.20.d:0 "Everyone knew that civil war was a possibility in our disunified nation. Fighting has erupted in the major cities, with clashes between socialists, republicans and Qajar loyalists breaking out. However, it seems our disunity has been somewhat of a benefit, for outside the cities, most people do not care enough about their government to fight for it. This means that the fighting is fully contained in the cities. It will be a bloody fight going forward, and whoever comes out victorious will unify [PER.GetNameDef] under their government, and the losers will no doubt be stripped of any influence."
pers.20.a:0 "Let the best party win."

pers.21.t:0 "The fight for Isfahan"
pers.21.d:0 "Isfahan, once the capital of Safavid empire, is considered one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s most beautiful cities and has many historical sites. It is so popular that some refer to it as "Isfahan, half of the world". In the past few days since Shah Ahmad Qajar's death, pro-Hassan Mirza forces have managed to seize important locations around the city, like the Chehel Sotun palace and Naghsh-e Jahan Square, in order to stop any sort of resistance from anti-monarchist groups. Meanwhile, a small group of rebels who were preparing to strike the city have managed to capture the bridges on Zayandeh Rud river and destroyed them, except the famous Safavid bridges of Si o Se Pol and Khaju, effectively cutting the royalists out of the southern part of the city."
pers.21.a:0 "Loyalist forces must push, even if it's dangerous."
pers.21.b:0 "The loyalists will try to encircle the rebels by rowing to the other side."

pers.22.t:0 "The fight for Tabriz"
pers.22.d:0 "Tabriz, one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s historical cities, dating back to the Sassanid era and gaining importance as the capital of [PER.GetNameDef] during the Ilkhanate era and the Safavids at their rise and an important economic centre throughout [PER.GetNameDef]'s history, has been eerily silent for the last couple of days. Just a few days ago with the death of Ahmad Shah Qajar, the revolutionaries present in the city, much like 1908's constitutional revolution, began to take control of the city. In a fast swoop of the important locations, including Constitution house of Tabriz, Tabriz Grand Bazaar and Kabud mosque, they manage to almost capture the entirety of the city. While those loyal to Hassan Mirza were surprised by the Tabrizi Revolutionaries, they managed to secure the Arg-e Alishah Mausoleum as it proved a good location to holdout against revolutionary forces, as was proven by Russians who took control of Tabriz in 1911."
pers.22.a:0 "The Revolutionaries storm the Arg-e Alishah in order to defeat the royalists."
pers.22.b:0 "The rebels delay the attack to negotiate peace terms with their commanding officer."

pers.24.t:0 "The fight for Mashhad"
pers.24.d:0 "The Holiest city for Shias in [PER.GetNameDef], the resting place of the Shia 8th Imam Reza, is currently in a state of war, ever since the Shah died. Revolutionaries, having a small foothold in the city, have barely managed to hold their ground against the high concentration of royalist forces, so they have resorted to guerilla warfare and damaging government buildings, attacking royalist patrols, and blowing supply caches. However, this most likely will not be successful."
pers.24.a:0 "The rebels are soon rooted out by loyal citizens."

pers.26.t:0 "The fight for Shiraz"
pers.26.d:0 "Shiraz is probably one of the oldest [PER.GetAdjective] cities to exist, dating back to the Achaemenid Empire and its foundation. Being one of [PER.GetNameDef]'s cultural capitals throughout history, Shiraz has an important role in [PER.GetNameDef]'s identity and political affairs. In the past couple of days since the death of the Shah, the revolutionary forces have managed to take control of different points around the city with minimum damage to famous historical and cultural sites, such as famous poets Hafez Shirazi and Sa'di's resting place alongside the Shah Cheragh Mosque, the Quran gate and the famous Zand Dynasty fortress titled Arg of Karim Khan. While the revolutionary forces have managed to take control of most of the city the Qashqai tribesmen, loyal to the Shah, are moving in to capture Shiraz and might bring the city to loyalist control. Unbeknownst to the Qashqai tribe, the Revolutionary Bakhtiari tribe, who have always been in favour of the constitutionalists and participated in the 1907 constitutional revolution dispatched a huge force to help out the revolutionaries. If they get there in time they might just be able to tip the balance in favour of the defending revolutionaries..."
pers.26.a:0 "The Qashqai tribe hasten their march to Shiraz in order to reinforce the rebels in the city."
pers.26.b:0 "The Qashqai tribe launch an early offensive that could bring the city to their control."

pers.27.t:0 "The fight for Bandar e'Abbas"
pers.27.d:0 "Bandar e'Abbas is one the most important trade cities of [PER.GetNameDef]. Due to its port and key location in the Persian gulf, historically the city has been a centre of trade for foreign merchants and a location where most [PER.GetAdjective] exports take place. The port city of Bandar e'Abbas for the past few days has witnessed heavy fighting between the supporters of Hassan Mirza and Revolutionaries. Although the city was initially well guarded by Qajar supporters, due to its importance, Edalat party members had been secretly importing foreign socialists into the city in order to fight the Qajar soldiers when the time was right. As soon as the news of Ahmad Shah's death spread, Qajar forces began to fortify important parts of the city, especially the port, putting it on lockdown until further notice. Meanwhile, the revolutionaries alongside the foreign fighters began to strike the weaker Qajar positions when they least expected it. In a few hours the smaller Qajar outposts had been wiped out entirely, and when the news reached the Qajar forces it was too late for them do anything, but to fortify the last few major posts they held. Due to infrastructure problems, no reinforcements will get to the city in time."
pers.27.a:0 "The revolutionaries attack the last fortified outposts and claim the city for themselves."

pers.28.t:0 "End of the fighting"
pers.28.d:0 "It appears the fighting has begun to slow down. Hundreds of people were killed, both willing fighters and innocent civilians. Families have been torn apart over political beliefs, but order has somewhat been restored."
pers.28.a:0 "And the winner is..."

pers.29.t:0 "Loyalists come out victorious"
pers.29.d:0 "As the dust settles, it appears the Qajar loyalists have come out of the fighting victorious. Any remaining rebels who refuse to accept the new government are being arrested to ensure stability."
pers.29.a:0 "As it should be."

pers.30.t:0 "Rebels come out victorious"
pers.30.d:0 "As the dust settles, it seems the anti-Qajar rebels, a union of republicans and socialists, have won in the cities and so gain control."
pers.30.a:0 "As it should be."

pers.31.t:0 "Black Monday hits [PER.GetNameDef]"
pers.31.d:0 "The German economy has been growing ever since their victory in the Weltkrieg, and have strong economic links to [PER.GetNameDef]. Due to the size of their economy and our large oil reserves, our economy has more and more become dependent on Germany's. Since the Weltkrieg ended, our economy has been recovering quite rapidly, and the effects of the Persian Famine have almost been solved.\n\nHowever, crisis has struck Germany in the form of Black Monday. The whole German economy has crashed, creating waves affecting many other nations around the world, bringing their economies down with them. It seems one of those waves has hit us. Suddenly, thousands of people have lost all their money and their jobs, and families are going to be starving again. The leadership has met in an emergency meeting to figure out a plan to solve this."
pers.31.a:0 "Things can only get better..."

pers.32.t:0 "Wealth of the Astan Quds Razavi"
pers.32.d:0 "The Astan Quds Razavi is an autonomous charitable foundation based in [PER.GetNameDef], known as a Boyard. They look after estates, repairing and refurbishing old temples and other buildings, and even education orphan school children. They are a very popular and wealthy organisation, and even have influence inside our government. However, what we want to focus on is their vast amount of wealth. Seeing the effects of Black Monday on our citizens, the Astan Quds Razavi has agreed to give us some of their wealth to help deal with the problem. However, we have a second option. We could fully seize their wealth, giving us more money to work with for dealing with Black Monday. However, their is large support for Astan Quds Razavi, so seizing their wealth will lose us a lot of support from the public."
pers.32.a:0 "The deal is good enough."
pers.32.b:0 "Seize their wealth."

pers.33.t:0 "Wealth of Sheikh Khaz'al"
pers.33.d:0 "Khaz'al bin Jabir bin Merdaw al-Ka'bi is one of the wealthiest men in [PER.GetNameDef], if not the whole Middle East. Having had a share in the Anglo-[PER.GetAdjective] oil company and having received yearly tributes from the British Empire alongside his subjects in the province of Khuzestan, he became unimaginably wealthy and influential to a point where the province of Khuzestan was his personal kingdom. With the economic reforms under way we need a huge source of income and we believe Sheikh Khaz'al's wealth is the answer. If we can convince him to supply us with his wealth willingly we can prevent any unwanted hostilities. On the other hand, we can seize all his possessions which will entirely remove him as a threat in the future and also give us more supplies to work with. Although the consequences of such action will be severe."
pers.33.a:0 "We must try and convince him to supply us with his wealth."
pers.33.b:0 "It is time to get rid of Khaz'al. For too long his power has grown unchecked."

pers.34.t:0 "Remove the opposition?"
pers.34.d:0 "Ever since the revolution took place and the socialists seized the government, there has been one central question: whether we should work with the politicians of the previous government, or whether we should completely remove anyone from the previous government to complete the full revolution. The previous government, although having the Qajars be a strong force, was a Social democratic one, proving that the politicians are able to somewhat work with us. However, there is the chance that these reactionary forces, if kept in government, will try to corrupt and inevitably destroy the revolution. Although in the short term purging the government will have a dangerous effect, in the long run it might preserve the revolution permanently."
pers.34.a:0 "We must purge them, a clean slate for a new [PER.GetNameDef]!"
pers.34.b:0 "We must be better than the reactionaries."

pers.35.t:0 "Clergies call Jihad!"
pers.35.d:0 "With our nation under the threat of destruction, clergies all around [PER.GetNameDef], especially in Qom and Mashhad, have declared a Jihad. This will inspire our men to fight harder, and will surely lead to victory against the outside threat."
pers.35.a:0 "[PER.GetNameDefCap] fights on!"

pers.36.t:0 "End of Jihad"
pers.36.d:0 "With our nation at peace, clergies have announced that the Jihad is at an end. We have survived through war and gained victory!"
pers.36.a:0 "[PER.GetNameDefCap] lives in glory!"

pers.37.t:0 "Socialist Protests"
pers.37.d:0 "Hundreds of people have gathered in the streets, in protest against our current government. These people are part of the banned socialist 'Edalat' party, the main socialist organisation in [PER.GetNameDef]. Although it is illegal, it still has much support from our populace. These protests always end in violent clashes with the police, and every day more and more people are losing faith in our government. If we want these protests to stop, we must end the political chaos inside the government itself, and create order throughout the nation."
pers.37.a:0 "Someday, this violence might end."

pers.38.t:0 "1938 Presidential Election"
pers.38.d:0 "As we promised when we took power in the government, the first presidential election is taking place in [PER.GetNameDef], and there are many options for the people of [PER.GetNameDef] to choose from. Things are still very shaky, and people have still not fully recovered from the chaos after the death of Ahmad. First is a Democrat-Edalat coalition, with Taqizadeh becoming president. They have formed a coalition due to both of their leaders being close associates, and both working together during the revolution against the Shah. They have some similar views, so can work together fine for now. However, they do differ in many ways, and it will remain being a shaky alliance. The other main candidate is Mohammad Ali Foroughi Zoka-ol-Molk, leading an Tajadod-Eslah Talaban coalition. These parties have come together to try to reduce the influence of the Edalat and Democrat party, and disagree with them on almost every field. These parties can work together well, for the Eslah Talaban, having lost some popularity due to their alignment with the Shah, can implement their social policies, while the Tajadod party can implement their economic reforms."
pers.38.b:0 "Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh wins the vote."
pers.38.e:0 "Mohammad Ali Foroughi Zoka-ol-Molk wins the vote."

pers.39.t:0 "1942 Presidential Election"
pers.39.d:0 "Once again it is election time in [PER.GetNameDef], and things have calmed down a lot. First is Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh of the Democrat party. This time, there is no coalition with the Edalat party, due to tensions lowering politically. Taqizadeh believes in reforms to the economic system to help those who do not have much, like people who were affected by the famine. Second is Ahmad Qavam of the Eslah Talaban party. His beliefs are far more traditional, and believes that usually, less reform is more beneficial. These two parties have been in rivaly since the first constitutional revolution, and both wish to gain power in the new democratic state of [PER.GetNameDef]."
pers.39.b:0 "Sayyed Hasan Taqizadeh wins the vote."
pers.39.f:0 "Ahmad Qavam wins the vote."

pers.40.t:0 "1946 Presidential Election"
pers.40.d:0 "Once again it is election time in [PER.GetNameDef], and there are many options to choose from. Firstly is a coalition between the Democrat party and the Edalat party under Taqizadeh. The Edalat party have lost a lot of popularity since the first election, but have formed a coalition with the Democrats to try and regain their influence. Second is a coalition between the Tajadod party and the Eetedaliun party under Mohammad Mosaddegh. Although they disagree somewhat on social policies, economically they can work together effectively. Both are not major parties, so they need eachothers combined popularity to win. Finally is the Eslah Talaban party. They have gained much popularity since the revolution, for many people believe that if there hadn't have been a revolution, there might not have been as many wars as there have been recently. Many people have died, and so more people turn to the Eslah Talaban party to solve this."

They were the party that were in power under the previous Shah, before his health got the better of him. They remain very popular throughout the country, having proven their ability previously. They plan to remain moderate and bring stability and unity to [PER.GetNameDef]. The second cabinet is a coalition of members of the Eslah Talaban party and more authoritarian ministers. They all believe more power should be given to the Shah, and believe the Shah losing power was the cause of the chaos after the death of Ahmad. They are still against full control from the Shah, but want him to take a more direct approach to politics. They also want to put a tighter leash on the political scene, having the military general Reza Khan as security minister. Finally is a coalition of many parties, of Democrats, Eetedaliun and Tajadod ministers. They generally agree with the idea of the constitutional monarchy, but still want the Shah to have less power.

AUS_heimwehr_presence:0 "Heimwehr Presence"
AUS_heimwehr_presence_desc:0 "The §7Heimwehr§! is the most prevalent of all German-Austrian paramilitary formations. While, on the surface, it seems united, the truth decrees otherwise. Split between two distinct halves, one from Walter Pfrimer, and the other a duumvirate of Richard Steidle and Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, the Heimwehr frequently squabbles on its political positions, save for two - hatred for the socialists, and the guaranteed integrity of Austria... for now.\nFormed shortly after the end of the Weltkrieg, as the whole nation truly woke up to the stakes Austria was in, the Heimwehr rapidly gained prominence in everyday life. Many of these first Heimwehr members were German-speaking veterans of the Weltkrieg, and others those who had just come of age to serve.\nThese days, the Heimwehr's dominance has fallen off and its divides deepened, but it remains a formidable rightist force - one that Dollfuss and his allied Sturmscharen seek to exploit."

AUS_schutzbund_presence:0 "Republikanischer Schutzbund Presence"
AUS_schutzbund_presence_desc:0 "The Republikanischer Schutzbund is literally reactionary; as the Heimwehr and the Frontkämpfervereinigung took shape and Liebenfels gained a credible base of support, the SDAPÖ saw only terrible things. They formed the Republikanischer Schutzbund, whose primary goal was to uphold the democracy and promote the federalism that the Kaiser has been attempting to promote for the last few years. Wherever the SDAPÖ has a base, so does the Schutzbund. Much to its detriment, though, is the presence of KPÖ revolutionaries in its ranks, something which critics prophesize will stab the nation in the back when the time is right."

AUS_frontfighters_presence:0 "Frontkämpfervereinigung Presence"
AUS_frontfighters_presence_desc:0 "The §1Frontkämpfervereinigung§!, or the Front Fighters' Association, is just a clone of the Heimwehr to the untrained eye. Its humble beginnings were as a veteran's association, chaired by Hermann Ritter von Hiltl. Here it campaigned in the face of widespread home degradation for the veterans' well-being over the civilians. While almost exclusive to German-Austria, the Front Fighters Association had a sizeable base in Bohemia. Besides being virulently anti-Semitic and anti-Socialist, the Front Fighters had an ideology that landed entirely within the Deutschnationale Bewegung, primarily the Deutsche Arbeiterpartei.\nOnly after the South Slavic revolts did it enter its golden age, militarizing into what it is today and gaining much more influence."

AUS_sturmscharen_presence:0 "Ostmärkische Sturmscharen Presence"
AUS_sturmscharen_presence_desc:0 "Engelbert Dollfuss' paramilitary plaything, the Sturmscharen was first founded by Kurt Schuschnigg. Before the Schuschniggs moved to Venice to assist Edler with his governorship of the governorate, the Sturmscharen was Kurt's personal tool into empowering the corporatist ideas Dollfuss and he were formulating. Afterwards. the sword passed to Emil Fey, bringing the Sturmscharen and the Heimwehr close together. While anti-Socialist, the Sturmscharen's main priority is to merely keep the nation stable; while much of that duty falls to the army, the Sturmscharen are noted for their excursions into Trieste, Slovenia, and Pola to crush socialist strikes and ethnic tensions. This has earned them a good reputation among many Austrians, but the more they stamp things out the hotter the final flame will burn."

AUS_ont_presence:0 "Ordo Novi Templi Presence"
AUS_ont_presence_desc:0 "A rather mysterious organization, not much is known about the Ordo Novi Templi other than who leads it, where its primary power base is, and just how absolutely off-the-walls insane its ideology is. Chaired by the Österreichisch-arischer Ariosophischer Orden's, or ÖAAO's, second-in-command, Arthur Seyss-Inquart, the ONT's only purpose is two things: expand its power and vehement anti-everyone else. Frowned upon by even the Heimwehr and many German nationals, the ONT promotes a 'Germanic Restoration' that will come about only with the expulsion of Sodomite-Apelings and the introduction of Rassenhygiene into the national curriculum. Many of these more radical elements are ignored by its supporters, but the radically Catholic paramilitary and its knights are true supporters of the gospel of the Grand Templar. What the ÖAAO's plan is if it does ever get the opportunity to push forward is unknown."

HUN_tatra_army_presence:0 "Tatran Army Presence"
HUN_tatra_army_presence_desc:0 "The Army of the Tatras, or just the Tatran Army, is a staunch anti-Hungarian guerilla movement which is highly and impressively organized. This, though, is the only concrete ideology of the Army. The most militant guerilla group in the Empire, the Tatran Army is split into two corps: one that expresses faith in the Föderalismusplan and Vienna, and another who wishes for a free Czechoslovakia or Slovakia.\nThe Army as a whole is manned by former Czechoslovak Legionnaires and finds significant dual membership with Hlinka Guard and the Rodobrana. The Army is heavily scrutinized by Magyar authorities, whose branch of the Evidenzbureau have made it their primary objective to dislodge the Army from their resolute strongholds in the peaks and valleys of the Tatra Mountains."

HUN_cross_brotherhood_presence:0 "Frătiile de Cruce Presence"
HUN_cross_brotherhood_presence_desc:0 "The Frătiile de Cruce (FdC), or the Brotherhoods of the Cross, is, in Romania, a youth extension of the ruling Iron Guard. In Hungary, it is a major razor down the artery for Magyarization efforts in the region: the FdC is much more active than the Tatran Army, and is almost entirely within the palm of the Maurrassian clique in the Romanian National Party: Romanian Action.\nChaired by Ion Mota, the FdC is no stranger to assassinations and attacks on K.u.K. authorities. Staffed by disgruntled peasants and optimistic, fervent youth, the FdC is united on one front: the liberation of Transylvania, its integration with the legionairy Romanian state and the death to any and all detractors, traitors, and corruptors of traditional Romanian national life."

CZE_DBH_presence:0 "Deutsch-Böhmen Heimatfront Presence"
CZE_DBH_presence_desc:0 "The Deutsch-Böhmen Heimatfront, led by Konrad Henlein, is not as much a paramilitary movement as it is a movement for the integration of German-Bohemia into German-Austria in the event of a total collapse, federalisation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, or a conquest of the Empire by any foreign power. Vehemently anti-Czech, the DbH's mere existence and support of Engelbert Dollfuss puts great strain on T.G. Masaryk's repairing relationship with Vienna. The DbH is no stranger to calling Masaryk a traitor to the Empire, along with citing the famous 1923 Pardoner's Agreement as a stab in the back and a shot in the foot of Imperial glory.\nDisavowed by Vienna, the DbH is isolated yet very influential, and a conflict in Bohemia would almost certainly spiral into other constituents as it did just a few short years ago."

The Organization as a whole considers cooperation with Germany as acceptable, since it is the only country capable of helping Ukraine defend itself against impending Russian aggression. With the ascension of Andriy Melnyk as the Organisation's new leader, the UVO became less radical, maintaining its position as a militarist entity, though never disowning the nationalistic sentiments."

The same disappointment in God that mobilized Engelbert Dollfuss into politics electrified Liebenfels, according to him, with a Theozoan purity. From the cosmos, Liebenfels said, he conceived the modern ÖAAO - a pious land for the reformation of the true Aryan race. The failures of the K.u.K. Armee in the Weltkrieg drove many to the pages of Ostara; from there, the prophet-templar set out to bring his dream from the pages and the ancient conductors of Santur to the Earth, the future site of the great cleansing of the Sodomite-Apelings. While, at first, progress was slow due to the movement's heavy criticism as nothing more than 'compelling fiction,' figures such as Arthur Seyss-Inquart were nevertheless inducted into the Aryan halls of glory. Under the guidance of Inquart, Liebenfels changed the unfamiliar swastika to the shape of a Templar's cross, also formally beginning the militarization of the Ordo Novi Templi. With extravagant parades, featuring the purest of Man's Nordic-Aryans, of whom bore the chalices of Vril, figures such as Karl Maria Wiligut, Arthur Trebitsch, and Rudolf Elmayer von Vestenbrugg brought new views and widened the movement truly to a nationwide scale. The Grand Templar and his masculine Convent shall find clear meaning in the matters of the world, with or without the Habsburgs - and, under the auspices of Providence, restore the Aryans to their Santuric sanctuary.§!"

AUS_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "CS - Hardline - §LThe Christlichsoziale Partei was once a devoutedly only conservative bloc with a good dash of clericalist thought, but an aspiring dwarf has formed a large rift in the war-weary CS. Engelbert Dollfuss, a war hero from the Weltkrieg and South Slavic Revolts, came to politics totally unhappy with the absolute state of Austrian politics and his view that Christianity had faltered in Austria. Dollfuss slowly ascended the party apparatus, gaining major influence and serving as minister in many government positions throughout the 1930s. His heavily clericalist rhetoric and willingness to work with the paramilitary organizations rife in the cities galvanized the CS. Some saw Dollfuss as one who would bring order, and others as a no-good radical who would implode the ancient Habsburg Empire. Fortunately, Dollfuss himself is quite friendly with the Kaiser, bringing only further glory to his wing of the CS. As his thoughts shift further and further away from the middle-class-minded CS to that of the peasantry, some think Dollfuss finally has enough sway to break away from the CS and form his own political faction.§!"

Staunchly in opposition to Karl and Engelbert Dollfuss' teachings of Austrian patriotsm, the DnB supports the opposite - a Greater Germany comprised of Berlin and Vienna together in one force. Formed shortly after the South Slavic Revolts, the DnB's major understanding was created from the feeling of betrayal by the Kaiser as his policy began to pursue federalisaton and concessions to the constituents more and more. The Pardoner's Agreement, the creation of Illyria, and the Kaiser's close coveting of Montenegro and Austro-Venetian Governorate have all played into this mutual grievance, and the coalition was formed. However, being such small fish in such a vast ocean, the DnB have been forced to make amends - some agree to work with Kalergi and his Paneuropeanism, hoping that it will bring the two great German states together. Some look to the paramilitaries that have been formed in these dire times, many of whom have taken on Pan-German characteristics; the Heimwehr, the Front Fighters, and Pfrimer's rag-tag middlemen. Besides all the talk of Pan-Germanism, the DnB is entrenched in liberal-conservative ideas with an agrarian flavoring. Many doubt that the DnB will make any significant impact, but if things ever go haywire in the Hofburg... the DnB may fracture due to the growing cracks in the lines of loyalty between Kaisers, or shall lead a united German-Austria into a new future.§!"

AUS_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Donaubundespartei - §LA successor to the old Sozialpolitische Partei, the Donaubundespartei, in its early years, was comprised mainly of just Michael Hainisch and a few writers and minor politicians. Having faded into obscurity thanks to the efforts of th Christlichsoziale Partei and the rising tides of Radicalism, the Pardoner's Agreement spelled new fates for the pan-German party. As T.G. Masaryk returned to Austria-Hungary, he cooperated heavily with the efforts of the Sozialpolitische Partei, as they shared a rooted history in that of the Fabians of the late nineteenth century. How, though, some ask, did this liberal pan-German party gain such audacious ambitions for a European union? The answer lies in a young visionary, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi. Kalergi began as a mere student of the party, admiring the adventures of Masaryk. Over time, Kalergi rose through the ranks of the party. His electrifying appetite for European unification and maneuvering to earn favors with Dollfuss and his radical wing of the Christlichsoziale Partei earned the party new fortunes, along with recent disenchantment from all political spectrums with the CS and SDAPÖ. The Sozialpolitische Partei renamed itself in 1930 to the Donaubundespartei, all but solidifying Kalergi's lead role in the Austrian liberal scene. Hainisch, a German nationalist, disagreed with some of Kalergi's more open takes, but the two continue to openly cooperate. Believing in popular education, rights for women, and heavy focus on traditional values, he DBP has finally set the stage for its first major steps towards the ultimate goal: European harmony.§!" #Danubian Federal Union Party

The same disappointment in God that mobilized Engelbert Dollfuss into politics electrified Liebenfels, according to him, with a Theozoan purity. From the cosmos, Liebenfels said, he conceived the modern ÖAAO - a pious land for the reformation of the true Aryan race. The failures of the K.u.K. Armee in the Weltkrieg drove many to the pages of Ostara; from there, the prophet-templar set out to bring his dream from the pages and the ancient conductors of Santur to the Earth, the future site of the great cleansing of the Sodomite-Apelings. While, at first, progress was slow due to the movement's heavy criticism as nothing more than 'compelling fiction,' figures such as Arthur Seyss-Inquart were nevertheless inducted into the Aryan halls of glory. Under the guidance of Inquart, Liebenfels changed the unfamiliar swastika to the shape of a Templar's cross, also formally beginning the militarization of the Ordo Novi Templi. With extravagant parades, featuring the purest of Man's Nordic-Aryans, of whom bore the chalices of Vril, figures such as Karl Maria Wiligut, Arthur Trebitsch, and Rudolf Elmayer von Vestenbrugg brought new views and widened the movement truly to a nationwide scale. The Grand Templar and his masculine Convent shall find clear meaning in the matters of the world, with or without the Habsburgs - and, under the auspices of Providence, restore the Aryans to their Santuric sanctuary.§!"

AWR_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "CS - Hardline - §LThe Christlichsoziale Partei was once a devoutedly only conservative bloc with a good dash of clericalist thought, but an aspiring dwarf has formed a large rift in the war-weary CS. Engelbert Dollfuss, a war hero from the Weltkrieg and South Slavic Revolts, came to politics totally unhappy with the absolute state of Austrian politics and his view that Christianity had faltered in Austria. Dollfuss slowly ascended the party apparatus, gaining major influence and serving as minister in many government positions throughout the 1930s. His heavily clericalist rhetoric and willingness to work with the paramilitary organizations rife in the cities galvanized the CS. Some saw Dollfuss as one who would bring order, and others as a no-good radical who would implode the ancient Habsburg Empire. Fortunately, Dollfuss himself is quite friendly with the Kaiser, bringing only further glory to his wing of the CS. As his thoughts shift further and further away from the middle-class-minded CS to that of the peasantry, some think Dollfuss finally has enough sway to break away from the CS and form his own political faction.§!"

Staunchly in opposition to Karl and Engelbert Dollfuss' teachings of Austrian patriotsm, the DnB supports the opposite - a Greater Germany comprised of Berlin and Vienna together in one force. Formed shortly after the South Slavic Revolts, the DnB's major understanding was created from the feeling of betrayal by the Kaiser as his policy began to pursue federalisaton and concessions to the constituents more and more. The Pardoner's Agreement, the creation of Illyria, and the Kaiser's close coveting of Montenegro and Austro-Venetian Governorate have all played into this mutual grievance, and the coalition was formed. However, being such small fish in such a vast ocean, the DnB have been forced to make amends - some agree to work with Kalergi and his Paneuropeanism, hoping that it will bring the two great German states together. Some look to the paramilitaries that have been formed in these dire times, many of whom have taken on Pan-German characteristics; the Heimwehr, the Front Fighters, and Pfrimer's rag-tag middlemen. Besides all the talk of Pan-Germanism, the DnB is entrenched in liberal-conservative ideas with an agrarian flavoring. Many doubt that the DnB will make any significant impact, but if things ever go haywire in the Hofburg... the DnB may fracture due to the growing cracks in the lines of loyalty between Kaisers, or shall lead a united German-Austria into a new future.§!"

AWR_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Donaubundespartei - §LA successor to the old Sozialpolitische Partei, the Donaubundespartei, in its early years, was comprised mainly of just Michael Hainisch and a few writers and minor politicians. Having faded into obscurity thanks to the efforts of th Christlichsoziale Partei and the rising tides of Radicalism, the Pardoner's Agreement spelled new fates for the pan-German party. As T.G. Masaryk returned to Austria-Hungary, he cooperated heavily with the efforts of the Sozialpolitische Partei, as they shared a rooted history in that of the Fabians of the late nineteenth century. How, though, some ask, did this liberal pan-German party gain such audacious ambitions for a European union? The answer lies in a young visionary, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi. Kalergi began as a mere student of the party, admiring the adventures of Masaryk. Over time, Kalergi rose through the ranks of the party. His electrifying appetite for European unification and maneuvering to earn favors with Dollfuss and his radical wing of the Christlichsoziale Partei earned the party new fortunes, along with recent disenchantment from all political spectrums with the CS and SDAPÖ. The Sozialpolitische Partei renamed itself in 1930 to the Donaubundespartei, all but solidifying Kalergi's lead role in the Austrian liberal scene. Hainisch, a German nationalist, disagreed with some of Kalergi's more open takes, but the two continue to openly cooperate. Believing in popular education, rights for women, and heavy focus on traditional values, he DBP has finally set the stage for its first major steps towards the ultimate goal: European harmony.§!" #Danubian Federal Union Party

AUS_paramilitaries_desc:0 "Following our pyrrhic victory of the Weltkrieg and the many tragedies and subjective triumphs afterwards, many begin to question the end of our Empire. In this wake, multiple formations have been founded inside the Empire under the guise of keeping order.\n\nWhile no match for the K.u.K. Armee, incursions against these formations would be viewed as a brutal act of oppression against our own people.\nFirst, there is the loose §7Heimwehr,§! a decentralized alliance between Walter Pfrimer, Richard Steidle, and Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg. In league with the Sturmscharen, for the most part, the Heimwehr is the most prevalent paramilitary organization in the Archduchy.\nSecondly, there is the §tRepublikanischer Schutzbund,§! a paramilitary formed to counteract the Heimwehr and uphold regional democracy, dominated by the SDAPÖ.\nThen there is the §MFront Fighters' Association,§! formerly a veteran's association from the Weltkrieg. It militarized during the South Slavic Revolts, many of the Weltkrieg-South Slavic Revolts veterans flocking to its ranks, worried that the Empire might collapse. Filled with Völkisch Kaisertreuen, the Front Fighters have one agenda: keeping Austria safe, and if that proves impossible, its annexation to Germany.\nThe§g Ostmärkische Sturmscharen§! is Engelbert Dollfuss' personal political tool. Founded by Kurt Schuschnigg, who didn't go to any of the other blocs came to the Sturmscharen. Highly religious, the Sturmscharen share much of Dollfuss' ideas. Today, it is chaired by Emil Fey.\nFinally there is the §8Ordo Novi Templi,§! the order of the Ariosophists. Chaired by Arthur Seyss-Inquart, it is primarily based in Upper Austria. Liebenfel's greatsword into a greater political scene, it is incredibly volatile and is frowned upon by most of the other paramilitary establishments."

Under such a strange conception, the constituents will no longer be grouped into territories that ignore cultural divisions but made up into associations of peoples who share the same culture and religion.

National associations would thus impose their own taxes and laws upon the people of their ethnicity."
AUS_vienna_education_expansion:0 "Bourgeois Constitutionalism"
AUS_vienna_education_expansion_desc:0 "With the surprising clinging of the Habsburg state to life, some of the SDAPÖ have begun to migrate back to the possible idea of bourgeois democracy. In an era of ever-polarizing Austrian politics, such thought is not surprising - and just as unsurprising is the drastic shift such a Federation would create. Supported by Otto Bauer and much of the lefter-leaning SDAPÖ and the Internationale, a bourgeois constitutional monarchy is seen as an apt compromise that would see no need for the weaponization of nationalism."
AUS_unlearn_national_minorities:0 "Unlearn the Ethnic Minority's Role"

AUS_nations_without_state:0 "One State over the Nations"
AUS_nations_without_state_desc:0 "Notable of national personal autonomy, people would voluntarily join cultural groups of their people. These groups would function like nations, but can be anywhere inside the Empire's borders - and perhaps even beyond. These cultural groups are governed by their own laws and taxes, with only provisions from the state itself. These ideas form the basic core of Renner's philosophy, and for it to be implemented into a Danubian Federation, one must take special care."

bdeausel.0.t:0 "Inaction Paralyzes the Reichsrat"
bdeausel.0.d:0 "While recent years may have suggested a mutual understanding between Austrian officials, it is obvious to any that such is not the case. Any notions of efficiency and progress have been dispelled following Black Monday's catastrophic crash. A slew of problems, many related to the complete halting of inter-constituent trade networks, have suddenly reared ugly talons to tear the Empire apart... and no one is doing anything about it!\n\nOr, no one will. Legislators, among them members of the SDAPÖ, the Communist Party, the Donaubundespartei, the Christlichsoziale Partei, the Heimwehr, the Landbund and the Deutschnationale Bewegung, and even the ÖAAO have suddenly erupted into an interpersonal partisan 'war' in the Reichsrat over the direction to take. Attempts to restore order have been futile, and phones within the Parlamentsgebäude have been filled day in and day out. Even the Kaiser's word is not enough.\n\nSome legislators support working with Hungary first and foremost, while others support restoring grain routes from Galicia and working to alleviate the situation in poorer Cisleithanian lands. The vast majority support native programs to rebuild the Archduchy's strength while letting Bohemia, Hungary, Illyria, and Galicia more or less fend for themselves. Even here, the methods from how to do that result in even more friction.\n\nWith a gap between Streeruwitz and 'radical' member Engelbert Dollfuss, no measures have reached voting and nothing is being done."

The first measure voted on and agreed by nearly all parties, a vote of no confidence has been held and the Streeruwitz government and many more of the Christlichsoziale Partei have been forced into resignation or have been ousted out of office.

The rise of the Communist Party, the Danubian federal movement, the Ariosophic movement, and the rise of Engelbert Dollfuss and his 'Vaterländische' clique have all chiseled away the age-old foundation of the Austrian political status quo.\n\nThe resignation of the Streeruwitz government has hit the final nail in that coffin - the Christlichsoziale Partei is at an end of its dominance. Engelbert Dollfuss, Guido Schmidt, and much of the Heimwehr formations have capitalized on the incredible failure - and the CS is more and more at risk of falling.\n\nThus, the Party needs a new head. Most support the candidacy of either Wilhelm Miklas or Otto Ender for the inevitable snap election - but others look to middle-of-the-divide candidates, such as Karl Buresch, to uphold the CS' legitimacy.\nOf course, such a crushing political defeat has brought Dollfuss more and more credibility, and he either has just the same or perhaps even more popularity to enter the election with a high chance of victory.\n\nThere is no time to choose - one must be picked now!"

A man fitting in both an Austria of yesterday and of tomorrow, Kalergi is most famous for the popularization and universal adoption of the Föderalismusplan. Something which started as a thought exercise became an official policy, and for that he has gained a following; with him, an Austrian liberal 'renaissance' is underway. Liberalism has never been on the forefront of Austrian politics, but Kalergi's wise yet youthful mind has won over the hearts and minds of many who desire change.\n\nThe DBP is entering as a serious contender for the election of Ministerpräsident; but it remains to be seen whether the noble will be able to take the seat of office, and furthermore, realize the Federation he promises 'by the end of his term.'"

After the South Slavic Revolts ended, Transleithania remained more or less the same, sans the kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia; the condominium of Bosnia was joined with Croatia-Slavonia to form the Kingdom of Illyria.\n\nAnother notable effect was the implementation of a nationwide universal men's voting right to elect the Ministerpräsident and many other government positions once Kaiser-appointed. This clause is once again being invoked with the deposing of Streeruwitz as Austria's minister-president. A snap election has been called to decide who will lead the nation and the Empire through a most dire strait. It was expected since Streeruwitz' resignation; campaigning began long beforehand, along with calls to hold such an election. It seems such wishes are being granted... all we can hope now is that the people decide wisely."

While some on the interior of the government whisperingly decry it as the Ministerpräsident neglecting overwhelming duties, Kalergi has other ideas - and as the Crown Prince seems to act, so does he.\n\nIt is no secret that the Donaubundespartei is weaved with fine silks of Paneuropeanist sentiment. One of the principal supporters of the Pardoners' Agreement, the DBP has been a progressive force in the face of Austria-Hungary since its formation - and even a little before. Its allies include Edvard Beneš, Stjepan Radić, and Oszkár Jászi, all influential figures in their own right - but the picnic must be esteemly planned.\n\nThe question is only where such a symbolic move will take place - among other plans, Kalergi and Otto elected to discuss the Federation; its challenges, its delights, and its realities. Two locations have been appraised as the seat for the picnic; the tripartite border between Austria, Hungary, and Bohemia, or Austria, Hungary, and Illyria.\n\nObviously, while kingly supporters of the DBP would be invited from all realms of the Empire, the location is just as symbolic as the men who behold it.

These worries are compounded by the spike in unemployment as workers housed in these investors' workshops have suddenly found themselves on the streets, without bread and without coffee.\nOn the flip side, the bankruptcy of these companies have brought the possibility of Bohemian and Hungarian machine works back to Austria, and have lifted much of the shadow of the Prussian Eagle from over Vienna.\nAustria and its constituents must work together to weather the storm; if we do not, we will all fall."

However, by far the most successful and influential 'radical' movement of the last decade is led by Engelbert Dollfuß, a deeply Christian man.\n\nHis actions in the CS and his opportunistic nature in the events of Black Monday has given him enough popularity to challenge many of the old faces of Austrian politics for office - but his disdain for the Moderate clique and their inaction and 'forgetfulness' has urged him to make an extra step.\n\nDollfuß, alongside many of his top allies and staff, among them Leopold Figl and Julius Raab, has announced a secession from the Christlichsoziale Partei and the formation of a new one - the Vaterländische Front, or Fatherland Front. Aiming to restore peace to the Empire through shared Christian heritage, it also espouses a most unique 'corporatism' - not dissimilar to that of Portugal, Dollfuß has much support of both business bosses and lowly laborers. A distinct anti-Socialist mind permeates the party, yet supports labor with a zeal comparable to the SDAPÖ. The party's publicized formation has brought it new members, primarily disillusioned Christians and laborers.\n\nThe party is at risk of radicalizing further, though - it has no choice but to either stay hooked to the CS, or look to the paramilitaries and the Ariosophs for assistance.

With the Föderalismusplan moving along smoothly, the new laws decided upon in the Reichsrat have decreed much more liberal representation of the people; the federalized Empire is to allow any person, whether they be a Serb to a Transylvanian, to be elected as Ministerpräsident.\n\nThe news has prompted regional parties to begin 'Danubization,' a process of centralizing their similar-minded parties into cohesive Danubian units to wider represent their lands and people. Many of the local parties of the constituents have already begun plans and enhanced structures of these new parties, while opportunistic politicians flock to stages and squares to make a case for their election early. The air of the Empire tells of a zany first Federal Election, and it's not entirely out of the possibility that the first Ministerpräsident of the Federation will not hail from the Archduchy.\n\nHowever, the Ministerpräsident must be able to speak, read, and write fluent German and have at least some level of fluency in Hungarian, and is encouraged to also be well-versed in Polish, Ukrainian, Czech, or Serbo-Croat. While this dilutes down the list of potential candidates, it's widely agreed upon so that the beholder of the Minister-presidency will be able to fairly represent all lands."

With a general rise in right-wing currents since the end of the Weltkrieg, the Internationale has provided the left with a broad front to keep contending with both the CS and DBP as a major faction in Austrian politics.\n\nHowever, their unity in leftism ends there. Much of Bauer's left-leaning school of Austromarxists support a far more radical position of government told to be what the Empire would need to carry it through the next era. Meanwhile, many look to Karl Renner for his more right-wing stance, telling that it will keep them in good favor with the Imperial constituencies. A network of sponsored strikes has broken out across Austria, sponsored by the Communist Party, to bring attention to the workers' plight with rapidly falling employment rates.\n\nNormally, the circumstances would call for Renner - but the unprecedented economic disaster at hand has led to a rare opportunity where leftist sentiment is seemingly less-hated by the common man. By nominating and succeeding with a more radical candidate such as Bauer, the SDAPÖ hopes to regain the initiative from the 'radical' Heimwehr and ÖAAO.

However, the push to champion him the CS' choice for the upcoming election has backfired: Dollfuss' open readiness to working with the DBP and Heimwehr have discredited him in the eyes of some of the CS. Dollfuss is thought to be nigh-authoritarian and 'backward' for the needs of the Empire according to the CS, decrying him as a radical with little interest in assisting the vital industries of both the Archduchy and the imperial constituencies.\n\nNevertheless, Dollfuss' 'Vaterländische Front' is now a reality, whether or not that is what he wanted - but Austrian conservatism is truly on the ropes as Karl Lueger's inventive party is set back by a cyclone of new political forces.

The Kaiser, too, has even expressed favor towards his even more ambitious pan-European ideas, but the liberal's warm relations with the House of Habsburg has deeply shook the conservative world and many of the preconceptions of the people.\n\nAs for the 'radical' corporatist, Engelbert Dollfuß' deep piety has humbled the Kaiser himself, who sees in Dollfuß one of the most honorable politicians of the era. Indeed, Dollfuß and the Kaiser have an amicable relationship - his ties to the land and love for Austria has impressed the Kaiser so.

bdeausgleich.71.d:0 "The precursor to the failed Illyrian nation, the Condominium of Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Dalmatia, or just simply called the Condominium of Bosnia, was a nation that existed between 1927 and 1933 as the remainder of non-reformed Cisleithanian lands. With the formation of the Kingdom of Illyria, few expected to see the return of the Condominium, but a second disastrous, organized revolt of the entire nation only mere months ago shook the foundations of both the Danubian Federation and Illyrianism as a whole.\n\nAs the Second Illyrian Revolution is normally blamed on divisive Serbian intrusions and nationalist fervor, many call into question the idea of the Federation - but it seems the Emperor has elected to move forward with it yet, as many of the Habsburgs cite the poor and confusing government of the region as per the 1927 Ausgleich as the cause for revolution.\n\nNevertheless, the Ausgleich of 1937 has ended the military occupation of Illyria and reformed it into the old Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Now entirely under Cisleithanian control, the remaining lands of Croatia-Slavonia have been pledged to federalize along with all of Transleithania as of the incredible diplomatic victory for Budapest.\n\nMehmed Spaho, a Bosniak loyal to both the currents of Yugoslavism and Illyrianism, has been re-elected as Governor of the Condominium. He has been given extensive rule throughout the Condominium, rather than the decentralized nature of Illyria, and many hope that the Condominium's still-diverse ethnic makeup will be able to reconvince the wary of the success of Danubian federalism."

Day by day, the Kaiserreich is set back once more - and the pious heart of Germania threatens to be broken by the bubbling syndicalist lava.\n\nBut not if Austria, great Austria, can do anything about it. The increasing demands from Germans, from the farms to the factories and the cushy offices of bureaucrats, Germans wish for increased Austrian support in the Weltkrieg, but it is something we cannot provide yet. An idea has been hatched shall the worst come to pass: the Austrian army will cross the border into Germany and seize the whole of Breslau and Silesia in one fell swoop. We cannot risk taking more, as then Germans would be in arms: but with a diplomatic amount of force and an even more cautious picking of words, what is in reality an invasion of Silesia and propping of a Duchy of Silesia can be framed as a bulwark against Syndicalism if the German Empire is to fall.\nOf course, such a plan is with its risks: a war with Germany could result, or the addition of Silesia and more Germans into the Empire would upset the status quo. The order is up to the Kaiser: do we march into Silesia and declare the Duke of Teschen as the ruler of the duchy, or do we leave it alone due to its immense risk?"

The sound of gunfire and violent street fights reverberated throughout the city as those who put up some resistance valiantly attempted to do so. It is inferred that this seizure of our territory was planned in collaboration with the Bürgermeister of Breslau, who declared the city under Austrian control. Citizens were ordered to stay at home and the Austrian military has taken control of public facilities, including the railway and administrative buildings. Seemingly it appears that due to the undesirable situation concerning the Second Weltkrieg, Austria deemed such a seizure necessary to protect Silesia.

However, after the flag raising ceremony ended and Austrian divisions left the region, the Foreign Ministry was notified that Italy would back out of aligning with Vienna. Instead, Italy promptly mobilized divisions to consolidate their newly acquired territories. Officials in Vienna and within the armed forces are outraged at the double-crossing perfidy committed by the Italian government, this sentiment being shared among national newspapers and thus the general population being outraged at what appears to be a betrayal of the alliance.

We are confident that their return will be celebrated by all, and the high command has already ensured they will receive a hero's welcome. Many Austrians are now grateful for an end to America's Bruderkrieg and look forward to the nation's rebuilding in the coming years. However, some wonder how long it will take for America to finally be at peace as world tensions simmer again. It should also be mentioned that the new American administration has warmly expressed their thanks to Austria, acknowledging their indebtedness to the material support Austria sent to ensure their war efforts ran smoothly. America's recovery path remains uncertain, although many prominent Austrian industries have opened discussions with American businessmen to aid the nation in its reconstruction. As we navigate this new phase of post-war relations with America, our foreign ministry must maintain a careful and strategic approach.

While it isn't an elaborate celebration, Austria is happy to have their sons reunited with their families. It is interesting to note that some Americans have returned with these volunteers, having assimilated with their Austrian comrades through hardships on the battlefield. Most believe this is the end of our involvement with America, but others disagree. Austrian officers and military attaches who participated in fighting overseas have opened discussions about America's ideals and values. These individuals have exclaimed in social circles that these are noble beliefs to fight for. Now within the political realm, an idea has come to fruition about aligning with America through an Austro-American Alliance. This has created a fierce debate within foreign policymaking, as an alliance with America is unfeasible due to the distance between both nations on the globe. In addition, it is due to the current power of balance in Europe and the instability in the world at the moment. Even so, it wouldn't hurt to send a diplomat and open the possibility of such an alliance. After all, we all know the pain of brothers fighting each other."

Following the end of the Second American Civil War, both Austrian and American diplomats agreed to open a channel for discussing how their relations should be handled with the United States' restoration. After intercepting the developments of these talks, the Austrian diplomats made a preposterous proposition to us that raised our eyebrows.

While the Austrians invested considerably in ensuring that the current American government won their Bruderkrieg, the question remained: would Washington accept? Surprisingly, and to everyone's benefit, both foreign departments agreed to this initiative. Even our foreign ministry is uncertain about what this means for global politics as a result of the outcome, as only time will tell what the Kaiser in Vienna has planned. Ultimately, such a powerful alliance raises questions about its implications for the geopolitical landscape.

Our own agents have provided detailed accounts after a long and tumultuous week. They reveal an ironic turn of events following Oswald Mosley's rise as Trade Union Congress Chairman. Mosley's quest for absolute power encountered resistance from Percy Hobart, the leader of reactionary elements within the armed forces. In response, Hobart declared a coup to restore stability and thwart Mosley's authority. This decision led to clashes with Arthur Horner and his loyalist militias, who fought valiantly to preserve the revolution. However, Hobart ultimately prevailed and now holds complete control over the military, ruling the country with an iron fist. Surprisingly, Hobart's recent announcement states that Britain will again be governed by a monarchy. Within two decades, the British Isles had failed to stabilize, leaving many uncertain about Hobart's intentions and the implications of this leadership change. To the astonishment of the international community, it was revealed that the Kaiser in Vienna, Karl I, would become the newly crowned King of Britain. This development adds further complexity to the geopolitical landscape, given the recent Austro-American alliance. The situation in Britain demands the utmost concern, as it may significantly impact Europe and global affairs, with Austria's double-headed eagle asserting newfound dominance. In response to these developments, our foreign ministry must closely monitor the situation in Britain.

While it is no secret that die-hard Chetnik partisans still continue to operate in Bosnia and wider Serbian Illyria, recent strings of attacks have caught the K.u.K. Armee off guard. These partisans seem to be better led, wield finer equipment, and are more numerous - and there have been no warning signs. Captured rifles are either of Austrian variety or recent Zastava models - and this is excluding the artillery pieces, field kits, and slew of documents.\n\nA thorough investigation conducted by the K.u.K. [AUS.GetEvidenz] has discreetly telephoned the Kaiser to report 'urgent' findings - all evidence points to only one possible answer.\n\nSerbia once again meddles their terrorists in our nation. The last time such a thing was allowed to happen, the world exploded into an unprecedented Weltkrieg - and hushed murmurs throughout the top brass echo mixed sentiments - rapprochement with Serbia, to maybe find middle ground and avoid such a war from claiming so many Danubians yet again.\nOther, more colorful, tirades have been expedited, chiefly by Marshal von Hötzendorf, even calling for 'the transforming of their affront of a capital into a land whose use is solely for the howitzer.' Quickly, this has transformed into an open secret, and the Belgrade Pact seems to be wasting no time after subduing Bulgaria to strike us while we still lie.\n\nJust like years prior, the Serbian foreign minister is about to be handed an accusation - and piles of drafted demands form under the mark of angry Danubian pens, ready to send the Balkans into a spiral that shall leave it forever changed."

bdeausfor.91.d:0 "The Habsburg Monarchy has grown meek - or perhaps they have grown wiser. Vienna and Budapest have jointly demanded the immediate cessation of our funding and support of Illyrian partisans, and have provided more than ample evidence; mountains upon mountains, enough to stack into Montenegro and transform it into a flat plain. The message is duly yet dully noted: Austria is not here to play games.\nThey have sternly warned us in the trademark Karlist diplomatic tone that if this activity is to continue, Radomir Putnik would 'have his reputation tarnished so that the only place worthy of it would be a pothole in the ghetto of a bombed-out Serbian town.' Such a callous remark has offended much of the government, who instead clamor to spite Austria and ramp up efforts, no matter how suicidal such a measure would be right now.\n\nInstead, the official response has just denied all evidence, casting it off as a byproduct of our stunning victory of Bulgaria, which, according to the en-route response, simply reinvigorated hope for the cause. Nevertheless, foolishly admitting the truth would cause a fallout among our neighbors and the international stage, sans Romania; and would only give credibility to an Austrian casus belli of declaring war.\nFor now, the underhanded shaking of Habsburg absolution in rightful Serbian territories must continue unabated, lest Austria strike first."

Failure after failure, from the Weltkrieg, to the South Slavic Revolts, to the debts in Germany and the loss of Ukraine, and our inability to protect immediate interests have all created a totally unimpressive and even repulsive reputation and trend for the Habsburg Monarchy's twentieth-century road. However, such bad omens have been dashed with a zweihander of silver at our sudden reemergence onto the world stage.\n\nThe Donau-Adriabund, or the Danube-Adriatic League, seeks to reassert Habsburg hegemony over Central Europe and the Balkans, and perhaps even further - out past the Mediterranean on all sides. In addition, the Donau-Adriabund seeks to provide a front against the Third Internationale and Russia. Already there have been overtures made to Anatolia and Bulgaria, perhaps to resurrect the Central Powers of old. The Donau-Adriabund, with all its strategic weaknesses, must skillfully navigate the nations and politics of its neighbors; it may be hard for the Habsburgs to find willing partners in a land so infested with nationalism.\n\nDanubian citizens share mixed opinions on the formation of this alliance, on one part worrying of pointless wars once again coming to haunt them; while others see it as a necessary step to either Pan-Europa or a stable, peaceful Europe mediated by both Berlin and Vienna."

Even then, it was explicitly made known in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk that Ukraine would enter the Austrian sphere of influence - if anything, we are merely righting what should have been done so long ago.\n\nBerlin is especially furious at our 'transgression,' and the German foreign minister has delivered a list of demands which, summarized, demand the immediate withdrawal of Austrian troops from the Ukraine, an official apology, and reparations to be made. The K.u.K. War Ministry has only seen worth in the first point: the withdrawal of troops.

Even less had expected the sudden and untraditional attack by the Austrian army. Known for being more defensive than offensive, it was not foreseen by any European power, not even Ukraine or Germany itself, the rapid invasion of Ukraine and occupation of its western half as per the orders of Fall Blau.\n\nThe Habsburg Army had proved its worth since major failures in the Weltkrieg two decades prior, driving out rebellious Ukrainian forces and consolidating pro-Vasyl elements into a decisively commanded force, that, under the jurisdiction of a youthful league of Austro-Ukrainian officers, had handily secured the aforementioned portion of Ukraine in a matter of weeks.\n\nNow in a more than elevated podium to make demands from, Austria, with Vasyl as the spokesman, unilaterally declared a 'Duchy of Volhynia' wholly loyal to Vienna under his kingship. Nominally still the King of Ukraine, Vasyl has taken the title of 'Duke of Volhynia' and called upon the elder treaty of Brest-Litovsk to further claim his government as the legitimate Ukrainian polity.\n\nAll this has generated quite a stir in the Országház, who pleads and demands for this Duchy of Volhynia to be given a status like Illyria, which would fit with its very revanchist claim to all Ukraine. By contrast, Cisleithanian forces comprised the bulk of the Ukrainian fighting force, and some see it only fitting that it is a weak Cisleithanian duchy with little effect to Hungary or Imperial politics outside its own sphere, or, at most, to Galician Ukrainians."

With a king-in-exile on the throne of a Volhynian puppet, one must wonder if this is setting a trend of Habsburg abandonment of the defensive doctrine into an aggressive doctrine of expanding the dynasty's protection by force, tying into the lesson that 'the best defense is a good offense.'"

A predominantly Ukrainian city, the Habsburg king of Ukraine has requested an immediate, most instantaneous audience with the Kaiser.\nBeing a royal, notwithstanding the shocking shattering of the Ukrainian status quo, Vasyl was joined by a caravan of loyal Ukrainian officers to meet the Kaiser in Lemberg at once by the Kaiser's personal aircraft.\n\nAlong with [GAL.GetLeader], Vasyl recounted the last few hours of his predicament. The overwhelming opinion of the Ukrainian staff, anticipating a serious German response, is to 'invoke Brest-Litovsk' and 'launch an immediate military incursion into the Ukraine.' The Austrian staff, by contrast, was dismissive of the plan, fearing German reprisals. Most set in the path of peace was obviously the Kaiser, who acknowledged the strategic value of the move but did not wish to rile Ukrainian nationalists at home.\n\nAn alternative has been presented: a partial occupation of Ukraine, which would become a Duchy of Volhynia that would subsequently become part of the Habsburg Empire itself. This plan had mixed sentiments across the two sides, but seemed more popular than the other two. Vasyl, the governor of Galicia, and the Kaiser continued talks for a few minutes after the staff had hurriedly evacuated to prepare for the potential operation. The move has acknowledged the change in Habsburg policy since the Weltkrieg, and its accepting by the Kaiser leaves many of the veteran officers to wonder just how strained their backs might become over the next few years."

bdeausfor.97.d:0 "One of the most humiliating defeats of the Habsburg Army was its total inability to break Serbian lines and defeat a nation many times less its size in the Weltkrieg. It took the Bulgarian entry into the war to topple the Serbian nation, leaving us with little praise and only dour attitudes towards the war ahead of us.\n\nThese dour glares have not returned. Soldiers tip their hats and flip them in the air, camouflaged jackets of the new Kaisertreuen soldiers of the Empire swaying in the smoke of a subservient Belgrade. While Austrian parade blue swarms the streets of Knez Mihailova Street, the remaining staunch resistance has been extinguished with only menial effort. Even cities such as Kraljevo and Nish have been evacuated by Serbian forces, and the whole of Serbia is seemingly a Habsburg party ground for the week.\n\nFurther south, Bulgarian lands have been righteously grasped from the clutches of the cold Serbian corpse. With Skopie and Vranya once more liberated from Serb control, thick fighting only remains between the peaks and valleys of the Serb heartland. With our soldiers no strangers to mountain warfare, it is most obvious that these ragtag soldiers without leaders will end up in P.O.W. camps for the remainder of the war.\n\nAs for the horrible rebelliousness they have plagued our nation with, this decisive foreign policy victory has reassured many of restored Habsburg might and has shut down the rumors of Habsburg weakness and fragility for good. Our steel gauntlet extends over the Balkans once more, as it always should, and with the treacherous Serbia once more under the gaze of Vienna, the era of Serb chafing will at last come to a close. In its place will graciously be untold eons of a Pax Austriaca, where our Federation and the peoples of it will unite in peace and charity."

Obviously, with their weak army and overconfident forces due to the capitulation of the Prussia of the Balkans, such bark had no impact on the infallible and indomitable talons of the Double Eagle. Their boys' lives have been snatched and the mountains raise their peaks so that Danubian mountain guns may hunt Romanian pigs from the whole of Wallachia and Moldavia.\n\nSo, too, has the Romanian heartland fallen; with the arresting of major Iron Guard ringleaders and house arrest of the Romanian royal family, funded resistance groups such as Elena Bacaloglu's Îndrăzneti and Nichifor Robu's Lăncieri have all but collapsed in the wake of the onslaught of the [AUS.GetEvidenz] and K.u.K. military. Even Transylvanian nationalists have once more bent the knee, and lands where guerilla gunshots rang out to the skies day in and day out are eerily quiet.\n\nSuch peace is the case for Bucharest, the capital of Romania - battered and bruised, the city once more finds itself marched through by Austrian paraders. With the remnants of the Belgrade Pact sure to follow, Habsburg hegemony in Romania has been secured - and perhaps Austria will sprawl from the Adriatic Sea to the Black Sea, and 'Greater Romania' as a whole will find itself joyously integrated into the Habsburg imperium."

These clashes resulted in little overall gain for either side, but the message spells eerie early omens for the so-called Second Treaty of Wartholz.\n\nSigned between Austrian and Belgrade Pact forces, attended by veteran commanders and high-ranking royalties, the treaty dictates the swapping of occupied territories to their holders with minor adjustments and the official cessation of all hostilities between the Belgrade Pact and the Habsburg Empire, in addition to the cessation of separatist and insurgent support from both sides. The bloody Fifth Balkan War has left both sides wishing for a quick implementation of the treaty with as few legal hoops as possible, and such has happened; though each penstroke by each signatory is struck across the page with the understanding that this peace is untenable.\n\nThe nature of the Balkans, and the unfulfilled war goals of both sides during the war, has paved the route for a Sixth Balkan War. For the foreseeable future, though, both sides must have mutual understanding of the realities and faults of this Second Treaty of Wartholz.\n\nThe treaty has sparked outcry and celebration for a myriad of reasons in the streets of the combatants; some towns feature very few civilians to turn out in celebrations, but the inconclusive nature of the Second Treaty leaves a noted feeling of apprehension in the celebrations."

The colony's publicization due to the Treaty of Treze Tílias has caused an influx of colonists and tourists to visit during the supposed ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony itself, while expensive to the citizenry of Treze Tílias, was rather modest compared to one in Rio de Janeiro or Vienna. [BRA.GetLeader] and [AUS.GetLeader] came together and shook hands, before both proceeded to symbolically sign the agreed document. Diplomats, army ministers, and other politicians from both respective governments applauded and cheered the signing, and news has spread quick; with America unable to assert itself globally, the Austro-Brazilian Alliance has little to no opposition from neighbors of either major signatory.\n\nThe Austro-Brazilian alliance will guarantee a safe, cheap source for coffee and milk for Viennese coffee houses, besides a great source of lumber, labor, and shipping.

Vienna, a nucleus of the push into the future, has experienced a renaissance after the end of the Weltkrieg; with the advent of new technologies, more possibilities emerge. Hungarian physicist Leo Szilard, working with Austrian physicist Lise Meitner and German chemist Otto Hahn, have finally made the crowning achievement in a years-long succession of discoveries, theories, and hypotheses. Interrupted by spotty politics in both Austria and Germany and the economic depression, the scientists have successfully split a uranium atom in two, forming different elements. The process, deemed 'fission' because of biological cells, has been brought to the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry and been made public knowledge.\n\nLeo Szilard, known for patenting an early nuclear reactor, has reached out to famous physicist Albert Einstein and Bohemian associate Josef Mattauch about the potential for a nuclear reactor... or something much, much more dangerous."

Earlier that month, the K.u.K. Armee swept through western Styria, driving out paramilitaries and any villagers from sparse Alpine mountain villages under a strictly secret program. In a great pit with mountains on all sides, the atomic bomb, adequately named the 'Frederick III,' was raised onto a tower.\n\nThe culmination of months of around-the-clock work from all peoples and places of the Empire, quite possibly one of the most unifying moments in Danubian history, was this bomb - and as the planes left, the sun descened to the Earth, and in that little cauldron the sky lit up in a blaze. A wave swept over Styria and Carinthia, and all over the center of the Archduchy - despite press statements released in the news, the afternoon diners of Vienna were unexpectedly witness to the Frederick III's detonation. Even in Salzburg, Graz, and Zagreb, witnesses reported the rising smoke and the immediate lighting of the sky above. Even the Kaiser, who at that time sat on a balcony in the Hofburg with the Kaiserin, said that he could see the bomb from hundreds of miles away - and held his head in his hands to pray for the immense destruction the new weapon of war could enact upon the unknowing world.\n\nThe Habsburg Empire has successfully detonated a nuclear device - now decisively leading the world into the Atomic Age."

In a time where flight was in its infancy, rather than its pioneering tween years as it is today, Hess braved the skies and uncovered the secrets which swirled within: it turned out the result of these odd radiation readings, according to his hypothesis, was in radiation that had pierced the atmosphere from outer space.\n\nIn 1925, an American scientist confirmed his findings, dubbing them 'cosmic rays' - and has therefore breached a steel door for the Danubian scientists to exploit. The future of the atom and radiation is bright in Austria - and Hess' 1936 nomination as the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics has only drawn the ever-dividing line between past, present, and future.

It was specially designed for the new fad of explorers at the time: the poles of Earth. Funded by polar explorers, cultural institutions, and even Emperor Franz Josef himself, the SMS Tegethoff began a voyage from Treiste to the port of Bremerhaven.\n\nFrom there, it traveled to Tromsö and then further north, where it got stuck in the ice two times. While all sailors except the engineman survived, the historic Tegethoff has been lost since, likely drifting in the pack ice, if it hasn't sank by now.\n\nWith Austria in a period of relative peace, some look to expand Austria's cultural and historic influence once more, and it would include the recovery of the expedition ship and its inclusion in a naval museum, perfectly coinciding with the navalist resurgence in the K.u.K. military."

While Austrians are wary of his intents due to his American stunt in 1909, Zamoyski assured the Viennese delegation of his pure intentions. But it is not just him making attempts - the Krajowe Towarzystwo Naftowe, or the National Oil Society (of Galicia) has also bargained for investment and lease on the ripe properties. With the Borysław fields yielding less and less results over the years, a delegation headed by the president of the Society, [GetKTNPrez] met with the authorities on the Ploiesti field itself to negotiate.\n\nMeanwhile, military officers have proposed an alternative solution to the issue - a state oil company of Austrian origin, staffed by crew of the Fiumean and Czech oil refineries, remniscient of that decreed by the Treaty of Bucharest. It would overtake what was German ownership of the Ploiesti fields. The competition, they say, would force innovation within Zamoyski's company, whom had already secured much of the late William Henry MacGarvey's Bergheim & McGarvey oil fields.

Yet today, to the surprise of those groggily awakening on the Dalmatian coasts, they found that it was not their clocks nor their minds which had roused them; a most booming foghorn had echoed throughout the cities. To the amazement of all came a wooden ship towed by a much larger icebreaker, and the circumstances were immediately clear.\n\nWhile not the most encapsulating news story of the last few years, the expedition to recover the SMS Admiral Tegethoff had been expected by most citizens to end in failure. Yet the sight before them told otherwise - and the ship's docking in Trieste was immediately received by the Emperor and a cadre of admiralty to confirm that yes, indeed, that the SMS Admiral Tegethoff had been recovered. A thorough sweep of the ship threw the doubts overboard; the ship was without a doubt the coveted prize of the mission. While porters of Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino were tasked with repairing the ship, reporters had quickly arrived to the port to gather details on the story.\n\nYes, indeed it is; the SMS Admiral Tegethoff is to be turned into a museum ship of the Austrian Polar Expedition and further explorers' exploits, including Austrian treks through Africa during the long-ago era of the Scramble for Africa.

The crew, of which none had suffered casualties besides cases of frostbite, reported seeing nothing of note.\n\nExpeditions were made to Kaiser-Franz-Josef Land, and the crew revisited Cape Fligely to re-raise the standard of the Dual Monarchy. In their defense, the crew pleaded that the Russians 'probably wouldn't notice until after a Fifth Weltkrieg.' The incident was shrugged off, and the receivers of the icebreaker simply asserted to accuse that the Russians never even found the flag in the first place. Despite inland trekking and even the production of a few maps, both of the land and sea, the Danubian Geographic Society was not surprised and have paid little attention to the return of the ship.\n\nEven with the icebreaker being equipped with multiple reconnaissance floatplanes, no evidence could be transformed into direction; none even pointed to the ship being there.

When air-to-ground radio was not able to link up with the floatplane, a squadron of fighter craft took off from the nearby city of Klagenfurt to intercept the craft, where the escort forced the floatplane to land at the airport to avoid being shot down.\n\nThe pilot identified himself as the pilot of the icebreaker, and ascertained that the recovery mission for the SMS Admiral  Tegethoff had failed, and that the ship had sunk. When grilled further, the pilot reported that 'he had been asleep' and produced the crew log of the ship, which detailed it being both close to ice formations and land. The pilot reported uncertainty on the cause of the sinking, but suspected it either be a Russian torpedo or a misnavigation into dense thicket of ice.\n\nIn the plane resided more evidence as to the ship, as the pilot recounted his course past Russian airspace and towards Finland, where a refuel trip took it to Germany. The spot-on memory of the incident has ushered in an official report to be incident, and the icebreaker has been marked as 'lost at sea.' The [AUS.GetEvidenz] has been instructed to not look into the Russian possibility, and the imperial authorities compensated Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino for the unexplainable loss of the ship.\nDespite the incident being kept under wraps, a few papers hae reported the incident - some say the pilot did it, while others paint a much more sensationalist picture of the sinking of the icebreaker.

Having been used by mutineers at Cattaro in 1918 to show solidarity between themselves, a precedent had been set for the long use of the Hurra-Rufe as the revolutionary call of the harbors of the Austro-Hungarian war fleet. By 1921, at the eve of peace, the Hurra-Rufe had become more of a call to revolution than a call to rise, frequently deafening officers as sailor clamored for peace, family, and bread.\n\nAfter the end of the Weltkrieg, the Hurra-Rufe lingered on in the minds of commanders for its revolutionary reputation. The Hurra-Rufe was phased out and banned after a mutiny in occupied Venice during the Trans-Alpine Strikes, but this only spread it to the imperial interior. The Hurra-Rufe then only served as the Austrian syndicalist's call to arms as a bastardized piece of Imperial history.\n\nSince the Strikes, the call has never heard its wretched cry atop the decks of the Imperial navy. That was until today, when a group of mutineers, in odiously similar circumstances to Cattaro, shot multiple officers and wrested command over multiple warships in the Pola harbor. They call for better protections for the sailors, anticipating terrible loss just like the First Weltkrieg.\nNo doubt instigated by the Parisian rats, the mutiny has thankfully not spread far and has been contained, but must be handled with utmost caution."

While many socialists are wary about the Catholic program, numerous others have joined in with the initiative.\n\nSpanning all manners of professions, the corporatist plan is boldly attempting to empower the Austrian middle class in a time which it is put under the most arduity.\n\nMeanwhile, in the inner workings of political parties, there is only hushed words about the plan; but it is very clear to all that the Vaterländische have taken the first step towards push Austria through its crises and into a corporate monarchy."

Nevertheless, militia reports have reported strange things that seemingly hint at not all being as it seems: one, the extreme presence of crows and snakes, two, the discovery of old pagan tunnels under the town, of which the village priest has apparent knowledge of, and three, the town suspicions of a poor maid and her charge. One of the maids typically disappears into the forest at night for unknown reasons; no patrol has been able to follow the disappearing girl.\n\nFortunately, a small garrison has been permanently attached to Kieferberg to soothe its woes.

bdeausint.19.d:0 "The Danubische Wirtschaftsvereinigung, or the Danubian Economic Association, is a measure created by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi to alleviate the dire economic situation of the Empire. Austria is notable as a case of 'imperial overstretch,' as our soldiers and logistics have had problms over the last few decades reigning in territories such as Bosnia, Galicia, and even Transylvania, to an extent. The 1927 Ausgleich was a good first step, allowing an ample amount of autonomy for the new constituents to exercise control, but some issues still persist.\nThe Danubische Wirtschaftsvereinigung, or DWV, is an association to nurse together economic and cultural ties and reaffirm the age-old Austrian tradition of culture, economy, geography, and Kaiser tying one another together rather than national identity. The crux of the plan involves infrastructure and reduced prices from member nations, and notably, a significant chop of the dualist structure. The DWV is designed to not only counter Fiume's chokehold over Hungarian finances, but bring these advances and even other gains in Bohemia out to all of the Empire, and not just Cisleithania or Transleithania.\n\nThough it is currently a means to an end, there is significant support towards slow reformation of the DWV into an association much like that of the Mitteleuropa, able to tie the Austrian sphere together with coin. Nevertheless, the DWV holds significant bipartisan support across most legislatures."

With the invention of the airplane, telephone, and rapid technological innovation and emplacement over the last few decades, authority and communication has been bolstered, but overstretch remains a serious strain between places like Lemberg and Podgorica.\n\nThe Treaty of Nikšić and the subsequent enslavement of the Montenegrin economy showed the benefit of an economic union; and as attention is taken off keeping the Empire standing and more towards giving it more legs, the idea of a new economic pact, alongside the customs union of Austria and Hungary, has begun to float around.\n\nCalled the Danubische Wirtschaftsvereinigung, this hypothetical union would immediately attempt to wholly link the economies and exchange of culture between Transleithania, western Cisleithania, and eastern Cisleithania. Some say the adoption is frankly not worth the effort at the moment, but others see great profits in the DWV's future.

Embassies lowered the old civil ensign of the Dual Monarchy and raised the banner of the [AUS.GetFederationName].\n\nThe Dual Monarchy is no more.

However, with the Federation realized, many have openly questioned if Fiume-Zadar still must retain its special status. With no Hungary or conflict between Cisleithania and Transleithania to muck up the cogs of the Habsburg Empire, Fiume-Zadar now has no purpose to exist.\n\nHowever, its high autonomy has certainly shown benefits, if its importance over Trieste is anything to be of note.

Minister of Foreign Affairs, responsible for both Austria and Hungary's unified foreign direction, has fallen bedridden with a terrible bout of illness in a crucial time. Unable to perform his duties, a crisis has erupted in the K.u.K. foreign ministry - the chafing subjects of the Empire might look to assert themselves, especially the Crown of Bohemia under Masaryk. Hungarian officials of the Ministerium support a mere temporary caregiver, but Austrians seek for his resignation and retirement.\n\nOf the replacements, two come to mind - Leopold Figl, moderate candidate, or Guido Schmidt, radical candidate. While Schmidt would most certainly be the stauncher and more aggressive between the two, electing either side could divide the populace of the Empire even more, as the CS has entered a decline and schism within its ranks. Another idea has, too, floated around: the appointment of the Hungarian veteran diplomat, Frigyes Szapáry. Obviously the choice of Budapest, Szapáry is a noted Russophobe and has served for a long time in the upper ranks of the K.u.K. Ministerium. A proponent of the Treaty of Nikšić and even a supporter of the Fiume compromise, Szapáry holds views admirable to both federalist Austrians and conservative Hungarians. No choice is fully holy and the other horrible; we must simply do what's right for the Kaiser and Empire."

The meddling Heimwehr and Frontkämpfervereinigung, not to mention the ridiculous ONT, have been sent off the streets for the time being. Parliamentarianism remains supreme in the transitional Austrian government.\n\nThe champion of the house has undoubtedly turned out to be the SDAPÖ; its long history of worker's rights and the aborted Viennese city reform plans in the early 30's have been recalled during its electoral campaign and the transfer of power from monarch to man. Yet still, the ascent of major trade unionists, no doubt due to some level of Internationale meddling. As the SDAPÖ remains much more electorally powerful than the Communist Party, major representatives of union and freedom movements such as Rosa Jochmann and the Combined Syndicates' friend Manfred Ackermann have gained sufficient influence and popular support to dominate the government.\n\nHowever, these unionists are no true Syndicalists - while they adhere and attend to the values of Syndicalism, their loyalties lie in Otto Bauer's gospel of Austromarxism; its cosmopolitan yet German-national talk and its moderation, empiricism, and data-driven policymaking.

These developments are sure to doom industrial development in the Archduchy; trains are already finding themselves with less passengers.\n\nThis has caused an uproar in the bankers' class. The fall of these two massive banks has sent trust in the banks into a nosedive, and many are worrying that the Creditanstalt, the Bodencreditanstalt, and the Anglo-Austrian could soon follow. While the government has tried much to prevent the fall of the bankers with a myriad of plans, three solutions seem most probable: one, bailing out the bank with the already-meagre funds of the central government, perhaps even with the help of Transleithania; two, further indebting ourselves to Germany by reaching out to any of its banks that can still provide, or three, merging the banks.

As the Habsburg monarchy scrambled to reassert their authority within whatever holdings they still retained following their failure to stabilize ethnic tensions within the Empire, the coalition of socialists that is the Danubian Internationale, already restless from the failure of the monarchy, took up arms and brought down the archaic empire. With the royal family either in prison or fled abroad, the Socialist Republic of Austria has been proclaimed, signaling the end of the final vestiges of the 19th century. A provisional Central Council of the Danubian Internationale has been formed to lead the nation for now, as the coalition of socialists work to remove the remaining Habsburg influence, and strengthen the revolution against the many reactionaries that still surround them, namely the German Empire, whose divisions has been observed to be mobilized to the Austrian border.

Its ancient concordats and traditions unraveled and all the dynasty stands for in question, it remains to be seen if the House of Austria will meet its final, dying, breaths at the face of a world ready to forget it.\nRegardless of the polycrisis at hand, the recent 'anarchy' plaguing all of the former Monarchy has led to resignation after resignation of government officials; from city councillors, to legislative speakers and members, and finally the K.u.K. Common Foreign Minister. Unable to maintain the sacred union of Habsburg crown lands, the foreign ministry lays vacant, and with so many other issues and problems rising like wicked, verdant weeds, the administration has been stretched as thin as can be; many fear worse disintegration.\n\nEngelbert Dollfuss, still unyielding to the many problems at hand, and in the previous few days having decisively expanded the government's power by reinvoking the 1917 Wartime Economy Authority Law, has declared the situation in the Monarchy 'wholly untenable' and has personally subsumed almost all executive functions, save for those held by the Kaiser, in a swift self-coup almost resembling absolute monarchic rule. In a speech to the uneasy and rowdy houses of Cisleithania, Dollfuss preached the gospel of his corporate state, vowing to immediately restructure what remained of loyal Austria into the federative state it has longed to be.\n\nClearly, though, these nigh-dictatorial auspices have caught him in the glaring eyes of many a politician. Despite interior division, Dollfuss' much-needed decisiveness has already proved more than fruitful; many in the Empire have expressed support, or at least acceptance, of the new corporate nature."

POLITICS_KARL_BOTDE_DESC:0 "Kaiser Karl I von Habsburg-Lothringen, IV. Károly, Karel III; Karl Franz Josef Ludwig Hubert Georg Otto Maria of the House of Habsburg-Lothringen, despite his crippled nation, has earned the respect of all his people. Karl I, the pious Kaiser who loves his Empire above all else. Karl I, the man who would do anything to preserve that Empire in its entirety, and its people. Karl I, the Savior of Austria-Hungary.\nBorn on 17 August 1887, in the Persenbeug castle, Kaiser Karl I was raised as a devout Catholic, brought to revere God and Heaven. Karl showed interest in the army and matters of the state from an early age, serving in the army yet not ever knowing much about the inner workings of Austria.\nWhen Karl's uncle, Franz Ferdinand, was assassinated at the hands of Serb assailants, Karl I became heir presumptive, and began taking a greater role. Karl continued military duties, earning the rank of Feldmarschall. There, on the Italian front, Karl I gained respect of his troops through his modesty and inviting friendliness.\nKarl I finally succeeded to Kaiser after his great uncle perished in 1916. Karl knew Austria could not continue to fight, thus trying to earn a separate peace with the Entente. However, these efforts ultimately failed, forcing Karl to fight.\nAfter seven long years of war, Austria-Hungary finally exited the Weltkrieg as a victor, yet only on paper.\nKarl I was and still is known for his idea of saving the Empire, the groundwork laid by himself and expanded by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi. This was the Föderalismusplan, a formal plan to federalize Austria-Hungary and correct the old wounds that Austria had been struggling with for decades. Karl's first move was one he aspired to make for long, that being coronation as King of Bohemia. However, the Czechs disagreed violently. Karl only saved the skin of Bohemia by instituting reforms, which he actually viewed as a good thing; a reason for change. The next move was made in 1927, during the Ausgleich. For one, the first step was taken towards a united Austria, it being free elections and a new constitution. It was heavily inspired by the United States, attempting to mimic the cultural melting pot America had perfected. To Karl's delight, the foundation was laid for the Kingdom of Illyria at long last, much to Hungary's displeasure. While Bohemia was pacified, what is now Illyria wasn't - thus beginning the South Slavic Revolts. \nAll this conflict disturbed Karl greatly. While he now had much reason to negotiate his Federation, he would've rather done it without any bloodshed. In 1933, Illyria finally became a reality, and in the same year, Ernst Streeruwitz was elected as Ministerpräsident. With him, Karl finally called on the official adoption of the Föderalismusplan, among more reforms oriented towards Imperial unity.\nAs with most other things Karl did, it came down to his Catholic belief in God, and his love for his people - to the Czechs, the Poles, the Croats and Bosniaks, any who lived under his crown; Karl loved them and the Austro-Hungarian Empire with all his heart, and as Austria-Hungary emerges onto an uncertain split path, Karl has promised to do anything, absolutely anything, to save Austria from itself."

POLITICS_RENNER_DESC:0 "Whether Karl Renner has actually been Anton Renner his whole life shall never be known, but what is known is that Renner has formed the three arrows that spearheaded the SDAPÖ's policies for the last two decades. He was first elected to the National Council in 1907 and held the position until his election to minister-presidency in 1927, when the Ausgleich reformed the Ministerpräsident to be elected by popular demand, rather than appointed by the Kaiser. Renner's first 4 years of the Ministerpräsident were noteworthy in the Wiener Bildungsreform, or Vienna Education Reform, bringing Vienna and the Circle more up to speed with modern politics, and expanding the scope of education and learning to all ages.\nIn this time, Renner also began acclimating to the idea of the Federation, which dominated Austrian politics today. Renner's Danubian Federation fleshed out and ironed his points of national personal autonomy, Austromarxism, and federalism. Despite the recent Trans-Alpine Strikes having boosted the popularity of his 2 1/2 Internationale's socialist teachings, Renner lost his bid in 1933, as some of his ideological supporters moved to the Donaubundespartei under Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi.\nNevertheless, Renner toils onwards, espousing his Austromarxist ideals in the preparation for the Danubian Federation."

POLITICS_ENDER_DESC:0 "The eldest of parents Herman and Victoria Ender, Otto Ender came into this world in Altach, Vorarlberg, into the political elite of the town. As young Ender grew under considerable conservative influence, he traveled to not just one, but four different universities, those four being the greats of Innbruck, Vienna, Prague, and Freiburg. Earning his law doctorate, Ender opened his own practice in 1908 in Bregenz.\nAs the years waned on, Ender took a more and more active role in public life, giving lectures and speeches until 1914, when the Weltkrieg began. He earned many high, yet minor, positions in the government. Upon the end of the Weltkrieg, Ender saw, like many other Danubians, the dire situation of the Habsburg Empire. He was elected to the Imperial Diet in the 1923 legislative elections, usurping Leopold Kunschak as influential head of the Christlichsoziale Partei.\nFinally earning his election in 1933, after the heavily American-influenced reforms were passed, Otto Ender now sits on the precipice of Austro-Hungarian history. The Empire balances on a knife's edge, and so far, Ender has succeeded - overseeing the creation of the Kingdom of Illyria and the official policy of a federal Austria. As ethnicites and peoples around the Empire bicker while Ender writes laws and speeches, Ender is fighting against the clock. Whether he shall go down in Austrian history as a failure or a hero shall be determined in a date that comes ever nearer."

POLITICS_DOLLFUSS_DESC:0 "A man of modesty, honesty, and Christianity, Engelbert Dollfuss was born in the little town of Texing. There, Dollfuss was raised with cattle, plants, and fields, earning him an early appreciaton of the lifeblood of society - peasants. When the Weltkrieg called, Dollfuss, now a student of law, dropped all to serve Austria and the Kaiser, attempting to join the army in Vienna, but was two centimeters under the required height. Undeterred, Dollfuss went to Sankt Pölten, demanding entry despite the height. Impressed with his determination, he joined the Kaiserschützen in Tyrol. Dollfuss was known in the war for his bravery, sometimes mocked for his short stature yet, at the end of his long servitude, earning the respect of all his comrades.\nDollfuss traveled to Vienna after the Weltkrieg, and having borne witness to Austrian surrenders and the incompetence of his generals, was rather disappointed in his people for their lack of faith. Dollfuss continued law practice, entering public life little by little.\nWhen Karl was crowned King of Bohemia, Dollfuss saw it as a unifying move - a Catholic king for a Catholic people. Yet the Czechs and Illyrians were outraged, and thus the South Slavic Revolts began shortly after. Dollfuss served once again, earning the rank of sergeant. Dollfuss showed particular stubbornness against socialist partisans and the Bosniaks, frequently rallying the men to hold positions. Dollfuss earned the Golden Tapferkeitsmedaille in 1930, after saving three wounded comrades under heavy machine gun fire, and killing four more enemy soldiers who attempted to capture him. Dollfuss was known not just for this stunning bravery, but also his Catholicism - frequently praying before battle. He also was noted for modesty, and talked to everyone like old friends.\nDollfuss returned home hailed as a hero, but inside Dollfuss was sickened with the faltering of Catholicism and order of Austria. Dollfuss, hardened by war and worry for the Empire, climbed the political ranks of the Christlichsoziale Partei, sometimes called out for his far more radical, clericalist takes on Austrian governance. Dollfuss was one of the first of the CS to embrace the Föderalismusplan, proposing unity under religion. And through all his turmoil and time in this world, Engelbert Dollfuss has never, ever forgotten the lifeblood of a nation - the peasant, the tiller, the farmer."

POLITICS_KALERGI_DESC:0 "The father of the Föderalismusplan, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi was born in Tokyo to a Japanese mother and an Austro-Hungarian father. Moving to Bohemia in his youth, Kalergi was taught Russian and Hungarian and was drilled into tough physical and moral shape.\nKalergi's career as it was today began shortly after the end of the Weltkrieg, in a visit to the United States. Kalergi was fascinated at the melting pot of culture, as all superseded into an American culture. Returning to Austria in 1927, Kalergi noticed the vast contrast between Austria and America. While America's ethnicities lived in harmony, Austria's bickered and fought for power and freedom. Thus Kalergi began writing and speaking for what he called the United States of Greater Austria, taking a name from an earlier plan to federalize Austria. Kalergi's plans were heavily inspired by America, taking into considerations niches unique to Austria.\nForming the Donaubundespartei in 1930, Kalergi's DBP has gained traction, and his idea of a federalized Austria has become a practically common goal for all of the major forces in the Austrian political scene. This development is mostly attributed to Kalergi's doing, as before the rise of the Donaubundespartei, there were still doubts about the whole federal idea, but with proper demonstrations thanks to rebellious Slavs, the case was made - and Kalergi came forth, among a tide of new liberal influence.\nAt the helm of the ancient Empire, Kalergi, a Japanese-Austrian thinker and political protege, plans to finally unite the empire, and even all of Europe under a singular, Pan-Danubian or Pan-European, banner."


POLITICS_VON_HILTL_DESC:0 "Soldier, leader, and minor politician, Hermann Ritter von Hiltl was born on the 16th of June, 1872, in Olomouc of the Kingdom of Bohemia. Hiltl, much like his father, followed in military service to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, earning command of a battalion of soldiers that partook in the defeat of Serbia and heavy fighting on the Alpine Front.\nBut Hiltl's story in the Weltkrieg only scratches the surface of the man today: staying in service after the end of the war, von Hiltl proved valor and ingenuity at the Battle of Sarajevo during the South Slavic Revolts. His war-hero status, much like that of Engelbert Dollfuss, had him marching home a hero of the Empire.\nDuring the Trans-Alpine Strikes, Hiltl, much like Dollfuss, was disturbed by the rising rides of syndicalism and communism. He formed the Frontkämpfervereinigung Österreich, a very similar organization to that of the Heimwehr. The Heimwehr and FKVÖ enjoyed an assumed alliance in elections and other paramilitary matters, notable for their eagerness to clash with the Schutzbund and even Habsburg soldiers.\nAfter the collapse of the Empire, Hiltl was furious - and like many other on his side of the political spectrum, blamed the Jews and the Communist Party for its disastrous dissolution. The FKVÖ enjoyed a surge in popularity from disillusioned Ariosophists, roughly equating it to the Heimwehr. The age-old alliance itself is beginning to crack, though - without the Kaiser, Hiltl believes the path forward is intertwined with Berlin - something the Heimwehr both fears and despises.\nYet, Hiltl has won over, and with Germany's unease to annex the Republic of German-Austria, he can at least make sure Austria ready for both them and the slew of internal thorns that grow and fester."

POLITICS_EICHMANN_DESC:0 "A lifetime member of the FKVÖ, Adolf Eichmann was born on the nineteenth of March, 1906, across the border in the city of Solingen inside the German Empire. In his early years, Eichmann's family moved to Linz to pursue better financial gains, and young Eichmann joined the Heimwehr. However, he found himself disillusioned with the group's ideas and ambitions, and found a much more viable alternative in Hermann Ritter von Hiltl's youthful FKVÖ. Eichmann dabbled in the matters of Ariosophy and Dollfussian corporatism, too; but neither of those radical ideologies gave him the sweet touch of glory he desired. To Eichmann, Ariosophy was nonsense; and Dollfussian corporatism was a warped heresy.\nDespite his reputation of being "boring," Eichmann's knowledge and grand ideas gradually rose him to be Hiltl's right-hand man, working to build the influence of the FKVÖ in the shadows and beyond.\nWhile his methods were weathered and used by many before, the tried and true worked yet again. Following Hiltl's death due to natural causes, Eichmann was nominated as the sole successor - and the bold, banal, and bestial new leader of German-Austria has grand plans for those both inside and out."

POLITICS_KALTENBRUNNER_DESC:0 "The other right-hand-man of the FKVÖ, Kaltenbrunner was born on the fourth of October, 1903, at Ried im Innkreis inside the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Young Kaltenbrunner befriended Eichmann at an early age, and through the Weltkrieg neither participated in, the friendship stayed strong. Kaltenbrunner, unlike his friend, joined Liebenfels' Ariosophists. Kaltenbrunner, raised in a fanatical family who would've jumped at the chance to link Vienna and Berlin forever, was also captivated by Liebenfel's tirades, but disagreed on the elder Templar about his delusional theories about places beyond the known world. Kaltenbrunner, rather, like Eichmann, joined Hiltl's FKVÖ, albeit a year after. Kaltenbrunner, egged on by Eichmann's nepotist whispers, rose to assist Eichmann in security, detail. Kaltenbrunner, however, served in the light - he personally commanded a sizeable force of Front Fighters and was particularly known for his harsh reprisals against Jews and social democrats who had gotten on the bad side of the FKVÖ. Now, following another two tragedies, Kaltenbrunner sits in the Hofburg, wondering just how to deal with the termites crawling through Austrian woodworks."

POLITICS_RAMUS_DESC:0 "A face of Austrian anarchism and the loose tendon of the 2 1/2 Internationale, Rudolf Großmann, better known today as Pierre Ramus, was born on the fifteenth of April, 1882, right in the middle of the grandest Austro-Hungarian metropolis: Vienna. Ramus took an early drive to the rising magenta tide of the social-democratic movement, and was thus expelled from school. From then until 1907, Ramus lived outside Austria - building contacts with fellow anarchists all over the world, he returned to the Empire known for the literature he published in his parental-induced exile.\nDuring the Weltkrieg, dangerous "revolutionaries" were locked up and sent to house arrest or prison. Ramus was no exception, but he was no dangerous revolutionary; he was a pacifist revolutionary. Ramus maintained these nonviolent ties throughout the seven long years of the Weltkrieg, and founded the Bund herrschaftsloser Sozialisten in 1922. Ramus' BhS functioned essentially as an Internationale for the numerous disparate anarchist groups of Austria-Hungary, effectively consolidating them into one force.\nNow, following the most violent conflict to beset Austria-Hungary since the Weltkrieg, Ramus has found himself at the head of the carcass of the Double Eagle - and with numerous wounds still pouring out of the head, Ramus has but a few goals: one, stop the violence. Two, destroy the state. Three, uphold a society of peace and individualism, all in the Free Communities of Austria."

POLITICS_KOHR_DESC:0 "Likely the youngest, yet also most intriguing and unique man to sit in the Hofburg, the young Leopold Kohr has experienced much for someone of his age; and yet, he has learned, adapted, and shall preside over the Austrian anarchist renaissance. Born in the small town where Stille Nacht was first composed, Oberndorf bei Salzburg, the young Kohr grew up in a quaint, small community that had already shaped his belief for all time. In 1929, Kohr had found himself amongst the throes of social democracy. However, as the South Slavic revolts had just concluded, amongst a turbulent storm in Austrian politics, notably the creation of the Kingdom of Illyria with overtures to Switzerland, Kohr was stricken down the path of the anarchist. Fascinated by the ideas of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi's Paneuropa and the Swiss modus operandi in governance, Kohr had christened himself a "philosophical anarchist" and discussed the matters of the future with personalities such as Orwel, Hemingway, and Malraux.\nBy now, Kohr's ideology is hard for any one man to pin down - still youthful, Kohr's ideas continue to evolve and mature. In power by a stroke of luck, Kohr plans to transform the shattered Austria into a shining example of humanitarian, community values, structured with the Swiss commune, and governed by the reinterpreted words of Coudenhove-Kalergi."

POLITICS_FEY_DESC:0 "The gilded right-hand gauntlet of the VF and Steidle, Emil Fey's history in that of the Austro-Hungarian Empire is a storied one. Fighting in the Weltkrieg as an officer in the Common Army, Fey was awarded the Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1916, serving on the Italian front. Fey participated in the final battle of Venice, which led to the fall of the city, and the subsequent march westwards against the dissolving Italian forces.\n\nReturning home in 1924 from a brief tenure as an officer in Austrian-occupied Venice, Fey built up contacts with the nascent Dollfuss and Schuschnigg within the Christlichsoziale Partei. From there and his comrades in Venice, Fey became aware of the 'Heimwehr,' an incredibly loose coalition of paramilitary groups who had formed in the wake of the end of the Weltkrieg. Fey founded his own branch of the Heimwehr in Carinthia, quickly rising to rival Ernst Rüdiger Starhemberg, Walter Pfrimer, and even Richard Steidle.\n\nWhen the kingdoms of Croatia-Slavonia and the condominiums of Montenegro and Bosnia broke ranks and entered open rebellion, Fey and many other Heimwehr commanders mobilized their troops to fight in Slovenia and Croatia. Here, Fey distinguished himself as a ruthless commander, subsequently expanding his forces even in the wake of increasing army presence.\n\nNow a battle-hardened veteran of Austria's troubles, Fey's Heimwehr wing committed itself to Dollfuss' corporate plans and assisting in the funding and military presence of the Schuschniggs' Venetian governorate.\nDuring the collapse of the Empire, the Heimwehr's consistency and brotherhood was once again thickened as they fought against the Republikanischer Schutzbund and Pan-German formations. Firmly in hold of the reins of the Ständestaat, Fey has taken up the mantle after Dollfuss' blunder, and while red scum and traitors look in fear, the valiant and the brave look to him with hope."

POLITICS_FIGL_SMALL_VF_DESC:0 "The moderate wind of a party decried as radical and undemocratic, Leopold Figl stays straddling a line somewhere between the CS and the VF. In his youth, born in Rust im Tullnerfeld, Figl was long associated with the farm and the field. Too young to serve in the Weltkrieg, Figl avoided many of the horrors of the Weltkrieg that many other Austrians still reel from. During the South Slavic Revolts, Figl chaired the Lower Austrian detachment of the Ostmarkische Sturmscharen, Dollfuss' paramilitary formed to fight the wave of unrest racking the country.\nFollowing this, Figl rapidly rose through the ranks of Dollfuss' circle, but Figl was noted for supporting rapprochement with the CS over disagreements.\n\nFollowing the formation of the Vaterländische Front and the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Figl supported Dollfuss' return to a democratic Austrian republic - but nothing of the sort happened. With Dollfuss out of the scene and petty squabbles occupying the eyes of the cracked Heimwehr, Figl took it upon himself, with his compatriot Julius Raab, to steer the Federal State in their own direction. Disenchanted by the South Slavic Revolts and the collapse of the Empire, Figl vowed to keep Austria stable. He became of the belief that all parties and ideologies should be at peace with one another; thus, he has few goals, all clear: the prevention of Austria into further anarchy, rapprochement with democracy, and de-radicalisation of the Vaterländ."

POLITICS_RAAB_SMALL_VF_DESC:0 "A high-school buddy to Leopold Figl, Julius Raab was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and fought on both the Italian and Russian fronts. Returning to the University of Vienna in 1921, Raab returned with a bitter taste of war. He began to engage in politics, and the subsequent death of his father prompted him to drop out of university. He became active as a "peacekeeper" in the Ostmarkische Sturmscharen, serving to keep the peace in upstart Slovene towns by force. Here he attempted to keep the Vaterländische Front friendly to the Christlichsoziale Partei, whom had grown dissatisfied with Dollfuss' actions during the Revolts. After the end, Raab reacquainted with Leopold Figl and found a mutual understanding with him; thus, a new political alliance started. With Figl, Raab ensured that the growing divide between Ender and Dollfuss never fully broke; yet, in 1936, it did. The Empire shortly after fell due to a myriad of other circumstances, and Dollfuss came out on top. Raab was a signatory of the Constitution, along with Figl. With Dollfuss ousted and the Federal State's chief ideologues in disarray, Raab took it upon himself. He seeks to reform the Federal State into a less radical, more truly free state; sidelining the Heimwehr and other military groups in favor of coalitions with the democratic opposition-not-in-governance. Raab seeks a few simple things: the restoration of an orderly democracy, resurrection of stable bonds between state and people, the resuscitation of the Austrian market and nationalistic character, and a 'grand coalition' with the Social Democrats, Kalergi, or the CS, while maintaining Dollfuss' views for the nation."

POLITICS_ARTHUR_SEYSS_INQUART_DESC:0 "Arthur Seyss-Inquart, born on the 22nd of July, 1892, in Moravia, lived a modest, usual, life. Born to a socially conservative father and mother, young Seyss-Inquart was raised as a Catholic with no explicit political undertones. Right before he signed up for the Weltkrieg, he began studying law at the University of Vienna. He served in the Weltkrieg as a Tyrolean Kaiserjäger, serving on all Austrian fronts: Russia, Italy, and Romania. After the end of Weltkrieg, Seyss-Inquart found himself on a ship atypical of a Dollfussian ally; he immersed himself into law and joined the radical wing of the Christlichsoziale Partei with Engelbert Dollfuss. During this tenure, he rose through the ranks of Dollfuss' clique, finding himself conflicted to loyalties on a pan-German state and a turn into new Austrian patriotism.\nSeyss-Inquart then became immersed in the Ostara magazine of Lanz von Liebenfels, acclimatizing to his racial theories of Aryan supremacy - but his affiliation with both Liebenfels and Dollfuss pushed him to a strange middle line not quite in either's party line.\nSeyss-Inquart found Liebenfels' tirades incredibly unrefined, even 'that of a senile abandoned geriatric.' Seyss-Inquart agreed with as much as he did disagree with both Liebenfels and Dollfuss; he saw Dollfuss as too moderate and disavowed his Austrian nationalist sentiment, but noted Liebenfels' theories as too murky and disavowed his suck-up attitude to Germany.\n\nNow in charge of the legacy Liebenfels has left, Seyss-Inquart has sidelined Wiligut, Trebitsch, and Vestenbrugg to reform the Ariosophic state and undo its faults.\nAmong other things, Seyss-Inquart seeks to restore the Kaiser, which he regards as a terrible move, implement Dollfussian economics with an Ariosophic flavor, and take Ariosophy out from the clouds and bring it to a clarified ground level so that all may understand and partake in the glories of the Austro-Aryan Empire."

POLITICS_JULIUS_DEUTSCH_DESC:0 "The primary commander of the Republikanischer Schutzbund, Julius Deutsch was born on the 2nd of February in Lackenbach. Having served in the Weltkrieg and as a union representative, Deutsch was active in the Viennese sporting community and wider socialist movement. Responsible for the formation of the Republikanischer Schutzbund after the formation of the Heimwehr in the early 1920s, Deutsch strictly worked in the interest of Austromarxism and the SDAPÖ. Having somewhat of a prejudice against the KPÖ, the Schutzbund is first loyal to democracy and second to the nation.\n\nAfter the tragic collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Wehrsport policy Deutsch had advocated and built up in his paramilitary allowed his forces, commanded by Alexander Eifler and Theodor Körner, to seize the upper hand against the disparate right-wing militias and install an interim government until the country is sufficiently stable. Aiming for a purely Austromarxist government, Deutsch and his paramilitary has promised to stave off revolution, reaction, and further desolation of the Cisleithanian heartland - but at what cost?"

In the current transition time, the Zentralausschuss acts as interium until a new leader is picked or elected.

austriaintro.1.t:0 "The Sick Man on the Powderkeg's Edge"
austriaintro.1.d:0 "One decade and five years ago, the Weltkrieg ended with a German and Bulgarian victory - not an Austrian victory, nor an Ottoman victory. These victories to the age-old rivals-turned allies were merely trophies, names, trinkets. Meaningless. Austria took miniscule gains, if they could even be called such. Austria was awarded Montenegro and jointly occupied Serbia, along with an occupation of Venetia and Lombardy.\n\nIn 1921, just after the treaty, Austria was in tatters. The military was made the laughingstock of Europe, humiliated time and time again at the hands of Serbs, Italians, and Russians. Only Germany's iron fist could protect the shattered bones that were Austria, as Germany pulled the majority of the Austrian deadweight along. Due to this invaluable assistance, Germany struck at Austria how it could: Austria owed Germany outrageous debt to be paid for the assistance in the war. Habsburg coffers have been bone-dry, but this only solidified the obvious.\nAustria quickly had to extinguish the growing embers, creeping up the Austrian mansion. Military units crushed partisans in Illyria, Bohemia, Galicia, and Hungry, subduing any and all independence agitators, and sending their politicians into exile.\n\nOn the bright side, all of Austria's neighboring enemies have been exterminated. Italy fell into civil war, leading to a prolonged Austrian military occupation, Serbia is a rump nation who has yet to rearm, and Russia stays far away, separated by German buffers. Austria was finally given breathing room, allowing Kaiser Karl I to begin saving his beloved Austria.\nAt first, it was freeing laws, speeches, and minor public displays. Then, in 1924, Karl fulfilled his first big move - a coronation as King of Bohemia. The coronation was extravagant and lavish, but the Czechs did not appreciate the sight. Riots, protests, and incidents of assaults became commonplace in a period known as the Couple Years' Disagreement, a little play on words. A couple of years after the coronation, in 1926, Kaiser Karl I signed a pardon allowing numerous Czechs and Slovaks to re-enter the country, with figures the likes of T.G. Masaryk and Edvard Beneš. It was, in fact, in Karl's favor, as to save Austria, T.G. Masaryk would be a valuable asset, if he could be convinced of Imperial integrity.\n\nHowever, just because Bohemia was, for now, pacified, did not mean all was well. In 1925, one year before the Agreement, the flames that Bohemia stoked spread to Croatia-Slavonia, which was at that time part of Transdanubia and Hungarian jurisdiction. The Pardoner's Agreement failed to halt the South Slavic turmoil, and in 1928 there was officially a state of revolt. Croats, Bosniaks, Serbs, any and all who were not Hungarian or German, rose up against Habsburg rule to fight for freedom. The Revolts were spurred on by two more major events. The two monumentuous occasions were, first, the Ausgleich, and second, the Trans-Alpine Strikes.\n\nThe Ausgleich of 1927 did two things first and foremost: it enacted a popular democracy, heavily inspired by the United States, and it officially began a policy of saving Austria-Hungary, although the law did not explain how it would be done. Croatia-Slavonia was freed from Hungary, and instead made a separate entity in Austria. However, the Hungarians were infuriated by the loss of their territory, thus resulting in the Fiume Compromise of 1927. The Fiume Compromise stated that Hungary would retain exclusive ownership of Fiume and Zadar, including their ports, and did not take extra fees going to the city. Miklos Horthy was appointed Governor of the Dual Cities, and the crisis in Hungary was stopped."
austriaintro.1.a:0 "Gott erhalte..."

austriaintro.2.t:0 "The Sick Man on the Powderkeg's Edge"
austriaintro.2.d:0 "As for the Trans-Alpine Strikes, it began with a strike in Austrian-occupied Italy, which fell almost fully to Austria in 1921, following the Italian Civil War's end. Austrian soldiers arrived as peacekeepers, as a despised force of stability in defeated Italy. In 1930, a strike in Milan, one of the heaviest resisting areas of Italy, began to spread out of control, and threatened to destroy Italy once more. The fires spread to Turin, Parma, Genoa, and Modena, where both the growing ANI and remaining socialists agitated for Austrian withdrawal. The strikes then hit a soft spot in Switzerland in Bern, appealing to the workers' increasing calls of worker rights and labor laws. Liechtenstein was not spared, and the strikes led to the rise of syndicalism and social democracy in Liechtenstein. With Austria's west engulfed in revolutionary fervor, there was one direction: east. Vienna, Zagreb, Trento, Fiume, and Trieste began experiencing the same symptoms as Milan, and in Fiume's case, as early as the first onslaught of the exhausted workforce.\nThe Strikes, once again, worked in Karl's favor in one way, who used it as a way to pass worker's rights laws and even shoehorn in a couple extra social laws, unrelated to the strikes. To Karl, he needed any possible excuse to disregard Hungarian and Austrian cries to keep the status quo. These two factors culminated in the South Slavic Revolts of 1928-1931, ending in two minor losses and one major victory for Austria. As losses, the Treaty of Nikšić of 1929 was signed with the Montenegrins. As per the terms, Montenegro would be allowed to reinstate its royal family, and would be on paper freed from Austria. Montenegro, though, had few other choices in terms of allies, not wanting to be absorbed by Serban jingoists. Thus Montenegro stays under Vienna's gaze, for now.\nThe second defeat comes in the form of Serbia. Pressed by the rebellions, Austrian units extracted from Serbia in 1929 to focus on pacifying Illyria, leaving Bulgaria to occupy Kosovo and Niš.\nThe one good point is yet again subjective to just Karl, and as an extension to Austria-Hungary, who was able to push more laws pertaining to saving Austria into practice, discrediting Hungary and gradually subverting nobles.\n\nStill, Austria has breathing room. The election of Ernst Streeruwitz in 1933 has currently proved successful, and he has presided over the Föderalismusplan, an official rebirth of federalizing Austria-Hungary and stabilizing the vying ethnicities. He has also overseen the creation of the Kingdom of Illyria, a move to finally fulfill Karl's trialist ambition. Ender's government, and by extension, Renner's, has seen a dramatic increase in economic prosperity, criticized by new Austrian liberalism. The liberal movement is  chaired by Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, father of the Föderalismusplan, Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn, and Ludwig von Mises. Formed out of dissatisfaction with Austrian direction, the Liberals have gained a surprising hold over Austria over the last half decade.\nMore radical faces, too, have appeared: Engelbert Dollfuss, a major figure in the Christlichsoziale Partei, came to politics after serving in the Weltkrieg, South Slavic Revolts, and bearing firsthand experience to the Trans-Alpine Strikes.\nThe Heimwehr was formed out of poor war performance, wishing to save Austria militarily, yet offers no concise program on the ethnic situation, yet.\nSyndicalists, too, have risen, no doubt due to the Trans-Alpine Strikes, among other factors.\n\nToday, on the dawn of 1936, Kaiser Karl I finally can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Austria is beginning to finally crawl out of its debt hole to Germany, its enemies still cannot resist Austria, the military has finally begun drafting new reforms, and the Föderalismusplan is beginning to finally make real progress. The upcoming elections of 1937 will undoubtedly be the deciding choice in saving Danubia, or its burning collapse much like Illyria in 1928."

Such a status quo is both obviously untenable and ridiculously dangerous.\nThe K.u.K. Evidenzbureau, the military intelligence of the Empire, has recently turned to conducting affairs against targets such as the paramilitaries and the various more militant nationalists.\n\nThe percentage of §RImperial Collapse§! is the most major of all things to worry about; if the Empire is to collapse, politics everywhere would change forever. The rate at which the Empire accelerates is heavily dependent on its stability and the popularity of the Archduchy's ruling political coalition. The higher stability is, the slower it will take for the Empire to collapse. Certain random events will inevitably change things in the Empire, setting it further away or closer from demolition. What happens on the streets can have a devastating impact all the way to the Hofburg, and we must make sure that each move we make is in Austria's best interest. Among other things, recent studies from the Evidenzbureau identifies an upward trend in strikes, paramilitary activity, widespread protests, and political scuffles. Many sacrifices must be made, but it will be for Austria.\nThe Evidenzbureau, in line with its new civilian oversight, has also begun looking into the four constituents of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, plus occupied Venice, to root out dissent. Its mere presence terrifies nationalists, and none can escape the astute prying eyes of the Evidenzbureau. However, with our funding all over the place, it will be most effective with one telescope on one place at all times.\nOur Kaiser, too, is an important unifying tool of Austria-Hungary; it is no doubt that, without him, the Empire would be nothing.

If you cannot lower their revolt percentage fast enough, a revolution will occur - and this will increase percentages in all other areas of the Empire, principally Austria itself.\nLikewise, if a minority nation revolts, percentages will increase a little for all nations, but doubly so from the source.\n\nAI constituents (e.g. Bohemia) are less likely to revolt via focus if their revolt percentage is lower. Hungary is §Rthe most likely§! to revolt. If a constituent revolts, you will have a set amount of time to retake the constituent before you are forced to peace. After beating a revolution, they cannot revolt again for six months.\n§GDuring the Ausgleich, invited constituents do not gain revolt percentage.§!"

austriaintro.6.t:0 "On the Matter of the Paramilitary Crisis" 
austriaintro.6.d:0 "In recent years, the Austro-Hungarian Empire has had a problem with paramilitaries. Most of these paramilitaries are connected to minority nationalist groups, but there are many that are stationed in the Archduchy itself.\n§RAustrian§! paramilitary formations are connected to five parties: the Heimwehr, the SDAPÖ with the Republikanischer Schutzbund, the Frontkämpfervereinigung, the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen with the Vaterländische, and the Ordo Novi Templi with the ÖAAO. The presence of these parties will boost their legitimacy and affect what paths the nation may take. Too many paramilitaries, however, and we will enter instability from their clashes - so we must be sure to deal with them. However, ensuring a government-sponsored paramilitary gains supremacy will give us bonuses rather than penalties from their influence.\n\nMinority paramilitaries, on the contrary, are no good period. Their presence will increase the rate of the minority's revolt percent gain, and if they do revolt, will guarantee extra elite units spawn during said revolt. Certain nations can prop up minority paramilitaries, and as our military improves, the success rate of destroying them becomes higher. For a perfectly stable Austria, it is imperative that paramilitaries are eradicated."

austriaintro.7.d:0 "If we are to indeed fall, it is almost certain that the Austro-Hungarian empire will fracture into many warring states. These states will be stronger or weaker depending on their revolt percentage prior to collapse, and may have more initial territory. A collapse of the Empire unlocks new political paths for Austria and will greatly alter the status quo in Central Europe and the Balkans. The territories of the Empire may be ripe for conquest by other nations or by a revanchist Austria itself."

AUS_federal_plan:0 "Der Föderalismusplan"
AUS_federal_plan_desc:0 "First thought up by the Romanian Aurel Popovici, what was then the United States of Greater Austria has become the Föderalismusplan, a wide-reaching reform to finally federalize Austria-Hungary and, at long last, either outright quash or at least appease boiling ethnic tensions throughout the Empire. Kaiser Karl I, as soon as he gained his throne, made allusions to a federalised Austria, one where his people would be safe and represented. However, the Föderalismusplan has taken up much of the Austrian government's time and resources, working with other Imperial politicians from around the Empire, and gradually passing reforms.\nThe Föderalismusplan was not always so popular, though. In 1930, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi formed the Donaubundespartei after a trip to America, marvelling at the cultural melting pot and federal government. Initially jeered and booed, especially by Hungarians, Kaiser Karl took special interest in Kalergi's ideas and words, as the Kaiser himself began to step up his actions, attempting to wash a wave of support for the idea with Kalergi. CS politician Engelbert Dollfuss joined the cause soon after, espousing a different overall view, but at root the same idea as Kalergi and Karl; a federal Austria, one which would not suffer to its own hand. T.G. Masaryk, famed Bohemian governor, also joined the Föderalismusplan in its infancy, finally turning Bohemia back to the Kaiser.\nWhile the SDAPÖ and CS as a whole look longer to accept the Föderalismusplan, the objective of a federal Austria is now a common goal for all parties, much to Hungary's displeasure. The only problem now is a majority to pass the Föderalismusplan, as the four big wigs of Austrian politics debate and block each other's attempts on their personal view of a federal Austria.\nKarl Renner supports an Austromarxist vision of a united Danubia, coined the Danubian Federation. Coudenhove-Kalergi supports a United States of Greater Austria, taking significant inspiration from the United States of America, built on shared heritage of religion and pride in it. Otto Ender supports a reconciliation with ethnic groups and unity based on class and Christian identity. Finally, Engelbert Dollfuss supports unity on Catholicism and loyalty to the Kaiser. Kaiser Karl himself, though, is rumored to prefer Kalergi and Dollfuss' plans over the other two."

#bdeausel.0.t:0 "The Fall of Streeruwitz"
#bdeausel.0.d:0 "Ernst Streeruwitz's government had little credibility right from the start, crippled by divisions within the CS, and, since Streeruwitz's miserable failure in 1934 to centralise power in Vienna, many saw his government as on its last legs. Now, with the economy lying in ruins yet again after the crash of the 1920s, the political inertia in Austria has given way to open instability, with street fights between the Catholic nationalist Heimwehr, Social-Democratic Schutzbund, and the CS's own Katholische Sturmscharen reported in several cities.\n\nWhat shreds of support Streeruwitz and his centralists once had are no more, and neither wing of his party has any faith in his ability to maintain order, let alone restore prosperity. Of course, the opposition in the Reichsrat, Social Democrats and Heimatblock alike, is itself all too eager to see his back.\n\nWith no means by which to maintain a reliable government, Ernst Steerwutiz today offered his resignation as leader of the CS, making way for a leadership contest within the party. Although he remains Chancellor for now, Streeruwitz's successor will take the reigns after the snap election that many believe is around the corner."

#bdeausel.1.t:0 "The Vote of No Confidence"
#bdeausel.1.d:0 "With Streeruwitz's career at its end, and political instability fast escalating, Otto Bauer of the SDAPÖ today tabled a motion of no confidence in the government, which, if passed, would force a snap election. This motion was, predictably, supported by almost every faction in the Reichsrat, with Dollfuss's insurgent corporatist wing of the CS, its allies in Starhemberg's Heimatblock, the Social Democrats, and the agrarian Landbund all voting for the motion, while only Otto Ender's liberal wing of the CS tried to resist.\n\nAs such, a new Austrian general election will be held a month from now, on the 9th of March. Chancellor Streeruwitz, who is, at least on paper, still in office, will not be able to stand, having lost control of the CS, and the party now needs to look for new leadership in order to weather the coming storm."

#bdeausel.2.t:0 "CS Leadership Contest"
#bdeausel.2.d:0 "Ever since Ignaz Seipel's chancellorship, the Christlichsoziale Partei has been deeply divided between two different wings of the party. Indeed, it was the inability of either wing to rise to the top which allowed Streeruwitz to come to power in 1930, as his centralist policies were reluctantly supported as a compromise by both factions. With Streeruwitz gone, however, the inevitable reckoning between the party factions is at hand.\n\nOne side of the party, led primarily by Otto Ender, aims to revive the Catholic and agrarian policies of the Seipel government, but also emphasises a commitment to democratic institutions and parliamentarism, seeing themselves as the guarantors of continuity and stability. At the same time, however, some worry that continuity is becoming a less than attractive prospect to many voters.\n\nOn the other side, Engelbert Dollfuss, who served in the Seipel government as Minister for Forestry and Agriculture, fast gained a watertight reputation among the Austrian peasantry, as a devoted Catholic and a champion of their interests, while also urging harsh measures against socialism. When Streeruwitz came to power, he and Ender moved against Dollfuss and his allies, and for the past 6 years they have been a distinct faction ofen at odds with the Party leadership and government, closely collaborating with the Heimwehr's delegates in the Reichsrat.\n\nNow, Dollfuss has siezed his chance to attempt to take over the Party, while Ender hopes to steady the boat. Only one of the two men can win, however, and it is..."

The incumbent Christlichsoziale Partei, under fresh leadership, hopes to revive its fortunes among the public, but faces stiff opposition from Karl Renner's Sozialdemokratische Partei Österreichs, which has never previously formed a national government, but has long dominated the local administration in Vienna and several other cities, giving it a strong support base among industrial workers.\n\nIn the end, only one party can achieve the largest number of seats in the Reichsrat, allowing it to form a coalition with those parties already aligned with it, and the nation eagerly awaits the news of which party that is."

The violent rhetoric of the speech has sent shockwaves through Austria, and aroused much sympathy on the right."

Now, that co-operation has been continued, with the CS and Heimatblock committing to an electoral pact, whereby they will avoid running against each other in areas were they could split the right-wing vote, and will agree to form a coalition if possible."

Taking place in [ROOT.GetCapital], The Paneuropean Congress has convened with a strength and attendance never before seen. Paneuropean politics have wound their way throughout the throats of all our politicians, and it is agreed: today, the Paneuropean Movement makes its greatest leap forward. Kalergi's dream now shines over us, and for the first time ever, our goal has a clear path forward.\n\nThe minister-presidency of Austro-Japanese politician Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, held for two consecutive terms thus far, have cultivated a plantation ripe for the picking of Paneuropean sentiments and their wider consumption. With enough political power in the DBP's hands due to crucial consecutive political triumphs, the wild support for the once-niche party have catapulted it and its Paneuropean sentiment into a limelight whose radiance cannot be understated.\n\nMany have criticized the Grand Congress, as it has been christened; they simply cannot fathom the history that takes place here now. Figures such as Otto von Habsburg, Konrad Adenauer, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, and Jan Garrigue Masaryk are all in attendance today to support the greater reorganization of Europe. The Grand Congress will primarily discuss the actions the government will take in order to propagate the movement and will be shortly followed by a series of processions and celebrations.\nAll through the streets and at every hearth jolly voices shall cheer: 'Europa Erwacht!'"

bdeausnews.6.d:0 "Talks between Vienna and post-war Washington have finally concluded in Vienna as of today. The Austrian support of the American government throughout recent times have not gone unnoticed, and a mutual easiness and friendship has found its way between the two nations separated by large and thin seas. Now finalized, the agreement signed in Vienna formalized a military, economic, foreign, and all other manners of formal alliance between America and Austria, thus birthing the Austro-American Alliance. Some critics lambast the agreement as a pointless endeavour which can only immobilize the other's ambition, but more hopeful eyes laud the coming of the light of Lady Liberty and all of Democracy behind Her. Nevertheless, the mettle of the Austro-American Alliance is yet to be tested, but it seems that day will come sooner rather than later."

bdeausnews.7.d:0 "The Belgrade Pact, responsible for the destruction of Bulgaria's gains in the Weltkrieg, has turned to accomplishing its ultimate goal: the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Dual Monarchy and the 'freedom' of the Balkans from Habsburg tyranny. However, over twenty long years have passed since the end of the Weltkrieg, and it is plain to any inspector-general the improvement of the Austrian armed forces over time.\nDespite its superior numerical forces, the Serbian staff has prepared for months for this moment. The Fifth Balkan War, a conflict to truly encapsulate the spirit of the early twentieth century, will mark the future of the Balkans: whether it lies with Belgrade and Bucharest or Vienna forevermore."
bdeausnews.7.a:0 "An independent Serbia shall never taint the land again!"

bdeausnews.8.d:0 "A string of bad decisions after bad decisions since Black Monday sent the ancient Habsburg Empire on a death spiral has landed it in a most unfortunate of positions: civil war. With trust in the throne and the K.u.K. Gemeinsame Armee to uphold the peace, and the crushing of federalist ideas as resistance in the Austrian heartland itself divides the Archduchy, its constituencies have split from the crown with little resistance from Vienna.\nIts Danubian Internationale, radicalized by recent events, has taken the opportunity of a workers' strike to the extreme, and the Empire finds itself divided between republic and Kaiserdom. Where the decapitated Archduchy shall lead itself in this uncertain state is unknown, but one thing is certain: the Dual Monarchy is no more."

bdeeunews.1.d:0 "Today, the geopolitical world was forever shaken. The Paneuropean Movement, only a few years ago laughed at as a utopian's false dream, has flown forth with a success and splender Europe has never seen before. For the first time in centuries, Europe's makeup was completely revolutionized not by rifles and swords, but by paper and pen; first an economic treaty, then a defense bloc, and finally, one super-federation based on the ideas of Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi and Danubian federalism.\nLeaders around the world have announced their congratulations for the new federation on its creation, and many hope that the new union will prosper forevermore.\nIn the streets and all buildings, calls can be heard: "Europa Erwacht!" "L'Europe se réveille!" "Evropa se probouzí!" "¡Europa despierta!""

GAL_eli_sanders_desc:0 "Born on September 14, 1904, Eliasz Gütmann was born a Jew in Słopnice, Galicia. Here, young Eliasz took many a trip to the United States of America, but after the Weltkrieg, his visits to his businessman  uncle began less and less frequent, and Eliasz moved to Lemberg in 1922 to pursue a better job. He began work as a paint salesman, selling high-quality paints from the Empire to the upper echelons of Galician society. Gütmann, a Jew, experienced frequent discrimination and lived in relative squalor compared to most citizens of Lemberg. During his three years of selling paint, Gütmann grew a distaste for the upper class, who frequently ridiculed or treated him poorly, and for the Austrian military garrison that had been stationed since the end of the Weltkrieg. Thus, Gütmann began to acquaint himselves with the local syndicalist and communist groups hiding either in plain sight or outside Lemberg, quickly garnering a reputation for his bravery and boldness.\n\n Gütmann's first clash with the law came in 1928, during the first weeks of the South Slavic Revolts. His second, a few months later, for heckling a garrison officer.\n\nIn 1930, during the Trans-Alpine Strikes, Gütmann began to take an active political stance as a mainline Galician communist, which, in Austria, earned him jail time.\n\nA Jew with aspirations for freedom for Poles, Jews, and workers, Eliasz Gütmann has finally seized the reins of Galicia and shall plot his own course."

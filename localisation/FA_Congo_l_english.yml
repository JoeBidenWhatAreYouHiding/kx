### Focuses ###
#Economic

COG_new_realities:0 "Post-Crisis Realities"
COG_new_realities_desc:0 "Our economy is both young and fragile, for we have just shed the chains of colonial rule and now stand as an independent state following the Mittelafrikan Collapse and the Congo Crisis. We must now face the harsh reality we now face - we are war-ravaged, alone, and outdated compared to the powers that would seek to reconquer us. We must adapt and we must build, for without a modern economy, our independence experiment shall fail."

COG_our_position_on_monopolies:0 "Our Position on Monopolies"
COG_our_position_on_monopolies_desc:0 "Monopolies such as the UMHK and the Compagnie Maritime Belge have long held a stranglehold on the Congolese economy. We must decide a final position on these massive companies: shall we let them continue to operate as part of our new regime, or should we strip these former-colonials of all their spoils."

COG_expand_ports:0 "Expand the Port of Matadi"
COG_expand_ports_desc:0 "As it currently stands, the Congo has one major seaport at Matadi, just East of the capital. This massive but singular port is our sole direct access to the wider world outside Africa. We must expand the port and build new auxiliary ports nearby, while also working to build ports on the Zambezi by making lucrative deals with neighboring regions like North Rhodesia in order to reduce our reliance on the coast. "

COG_congolese_black_gold:0 "Congolese Black Gold"
COG_congolese_black_gold_desc:0 "Off the coast and out into the Atlantic lies a newly found reservoir of oil, sitting just under the seabed. In a first for our nation, we shall move to slowly build up an off-shore drilling platform using materials left over by the colonials so that the Congo may have its own, yet small, source of fuel."

COG_tap_veins_of_ore:0 "Tap the Great Veins of Ore"
COG_tap_veins_of_ore_desc:0 "The Congo stands as one of the most resource-rich and mineral-abundant places on Earth. From diamonds and gold and iron and cobalt, most treasured and necessary resources can be mined here. We must expand our mining operations at once, taking over and expanding the old mines of the colonials while building our own in order to continue this legacy of economic prosperity."

COG_re_open_shinkolobwe:0 "Re-Open Shinkolobwe"
COG_re_open_shinkolobwe_desc:0 "Uranium is one of the newest minerals in hot-demand, and for good reason, as modern science slowly unravels the mysteries and potential applications for this radioactive rock. We shall reopen the great mine of Shinkolobwe and begin to stockpile uranium in massive amounts, for even if we can’t find a use for it ourselves, we know of people and regimes that would pay top dollar for even a pound of the stuff."

COG_dam_the_congo_and_tributaries:0 "Dam the Congo and its Tributaries"
COG_dam_the_congo_and_tributaries_desc:0 "The Congo and its numerous tributaries and feeder rivers hold great potential energy within their rapids, and as such we must move to build Hydroelectric dams all along the river. We must tap into our namesake to power our dash towards the future, while also using the redirected current to open up new usable land where the Congo once flowed."

COG_national_preserve_system:0 "National Preserve System"
COG_national_preserve_system_desc:0 "The Congo, like most of Africa, is home to unique and unimaginably diverse ecosystems that must be protected at all costs. The great beasts of our nation such as the noble zebras and lions or the gargantuan elephants and giraffes must be protected, for they are the symbols of our people and our national pride. Reserves, preserves, and state-run safaris shall be created so that we may ensure these ecosystems survive our push towards modernity while also allowing our citizens to witness these magesties of nature firsthand."

COG_mass_electrification:0 "Illuminate Africa’s Dark Heart"
COG_mass_electrification_desc:0 "Much of the Congo’s citizens, even within our urban populations, live without constant or even common access to electricity, massively hamstringing our attempts at modernization and development. We must begin a campaign of mass electrification to bring the light of modern civilization to all those within our nation, or at least to all those within our largest population centers. Through hydroelectric dams and new coal power plants, we shall flick the lights on in this Dark Heart of Africa."

COG_burn_the_carcass_of_imperialism:0 "Burn the Carcass of Imperialism"
COG_burn_the_carcass_of_imperialism_desc:0 "Though our economy is young and weak, we must build it from the ground up, without any influence from the old colonial system. The old Imperialist order collapsed due to ineptitude and greed. We shall not make the mistakes of our predecessors, no matter the cost."

COG_african_entrepenurealism:0 "A New Entrepreneurial Spirit"
COG_african_entrepenurealism_desc:0 "Entrepreneurialism is an integral part of any budding Capitalist economy, for without a functioning consumer industry and small-business sector, a middle-class can never truly develop. We must incentivize our more adventurous and eager civilians to start their own businesses so that we may walk into an era of prosperity together."

COG_our_own_industry:0 "Industry from Scratch"
COG_our_own_industry_desc:0 "With the old vestiges of the colonial carcass now thoroughly stripped for parts and destroyed, we must now begin the process of industrialization from scratch. With the little nascent industry we have, we shall rebuild a new economy free of the failures of the former failed system. It may take us some time, but it will ensure what industry we have is fully ours."

COG_local_needs_over_colonial_desires:0 "Local Needs over Colonial Desires"
COG_local_needs_over_colonial_desires_desc:0 "For too long, the former colonial system put the needs of the few over the needs of the many. Their greedy ambitions and hedonistic desires stunted the old Vrijstaat’s economy and led much of the old population to live in squalor. We reverse this policy and begin to put the needs of our citizens and our state over the needs of a few aging elitists."

COG_our_people_first:0 "Our People First"
COG_our_people_first_desc:0 "We must build an economy that puts the new Congolese man above all others, for it is our duty to the people who form the foundation of our new nation. The needs of the masses shall come before the needs of the elites or the remaining traitorous colonial elements, or any foreign element that seeks to infiltrate our perfect and prosperous Congo."

COG_uniquely_african_economy:0 "A Uniquely African Economy"
COG_uniquely_african_economy_desc:0 "From the ashes of the old order, we have built a new and prosperous Congolese state. Free from the sin and failure of the old imperialist order, our new economy is humming along better than ever before, putting the Congolese citizens before all others. Though we are far from over with our work here, and we still have a ways to go to match the Vrijstaat’s old raw efficiency, we are well on our way to a modern and prosperous new future."

COG_scavenge_imperialism:0 "Scavenge the Carcass of Imperialism"
COG_scavenge_imperialism_desc:0 "Despite the errors and missteps of the past colonial regime, they still made great advances in building the Congo’s economy. We should emulate their methods and refine them while scavenging from and building off of the ruins of their old and failed order, saving us effort and capital along the way."

COG_repair_colonial_remains:0 "Repair the Remains of Colonialism"
COG_repair_colonial_remains_desc:0 "Across the nation, the bones of the old order in disrepair and disuse, just waiting to be refurbished and repaired. The once burning fires of the old factory hearths must be relit and the old refinery furnaces reawakened. Once the damage has been undone, we shall then use their carcass as our foundation to rebuild the Congolese economy."

COG_modernization_through_westernization:0 "Modernization Through Westernization"
COG_modernization_through_westernization_desc:0 "The West, despite its flaws and past slights against our people, are currently the beacon of modernity in the world. To get a leg up over our neighbors and to bring true prosperity to our people, we must look to their ways as an example to emulate. Everything from modern appliances to modern industrial machines shall be imported and integrated into our economy to drag ourselves into the future."

COG_tip_from_kenyes:0 "Laissez-Faire Mercantilism"
COG_tip_from_kenyes_desc:0 "Drawing inspiration from the long-standing French influences that have permeated throughout the Congo, we shall embrace the idea of Laissez-Faire economics. Our citizens and markets shall be free from as much oversight and watchdogging as possible, for it is as they say - ‘The freer the market, the freer the people!’"

COG_follow_colonial_example:0 "Utilize Colonial Intellectuals and Experts"
COG_follow_colonial_example_desc:0 "The old colonials long were the only people in the Congo privy to higher education and technical know how, and with much of their numbers still residing across the wild expanse of the nation, they still may be open to aiding our new economy for a price. We shall hire these foreign experts to help us build a greater and more prosperous nation."

COG_neo_colonialism:0 "A New Form of ‘Neo-Colonialism’"
COG_neo_colonialism_desc:0 "The idea of Neo-Colonialism has slowly begun to foment as imperialist orders began to falter and cede land to independence movements or collapse to unrest. A form of economic dominance, it describes a system where a nation economically and politically pressures another nation into doing its bidding. We have spun this idea on its head, and have used the failed colonials’ former structures of dominance to bring us vast amounts of new wealth and economic success. We have conquered colonialism and the old methods of the failed Vrijstaat to build a better economy."

COG_congolese_economic_miracle:0 "Congolese Economic Miracle"
COG_congolese_economic_miracle_desc:0 "Through heavy reform, reconstruction efforts, and new society-shaping legislation, we have turned the Congo’s economy from a backwater tied to the old colonial regime into one of Africa’s greatest post-independence success stories. We shall use this newfound prosperity to carry our young nation into the future."

COG_modernity_dawns:0 "Modernity Dawns"
COG_modernity_dawns_desc:0 "Modernity - once an abstract idea to our people forced upon us by the old imperialist system - has now become our new reality. The economy we have built from the ashes of colonialism now stands as a beacon of prosperity, shining to all those in Africa as a prime example of post-independence success. The rest of Africa looks to us as we continue this economic miracle, for with this newfound prosperity we shall drag ourselves from our dark past and into a brighter future."

#Civil War Focuses
COG_tewapen:0 "Te Wapen!"
COG_tewapen_desc:0 "Our army is woefully under-equipped and ill-prepared for the horrors of war that await it as the African continent further grows more unstable in the wake of Mittelafrika’s violent collapse. We need to modernize and expand our military as soon as possible, for even now our enemies circle us like stalking leopards. The people of the Congo must fight for their governments, their ideals, and their lives."
COG_bringinginmercenaries:0 "Bringing in the Mercenaries"
COG_bringinginmercenaries_desc:0 "Soldiers of Fortune offer their services to whoever signs their paychecks. In these desperate times, we can’t turn away those who are willing to fight in the bush and jungles of the Congo in exchange for cash."
COG_emergencynationalisation:0 "Wartime Nationalisation"
COG_emergencynationalisation_desc:0 "In times of crisis, we can not be concerned with profits. The exports of the Congo’s most valuable resources must come to a halt; for we need them for our war effort. All resources shall go towards the war effort and most of our industry shall be temporarily nationalized."
COG_ourfployalists:0 "Sympathizers in the Force Publique"
COG_ourfployalists_desc:0 "When the Government in Leopoldville collapsed, so did the main force securing the Congo: the Force Publique. The FP is splintered - its myriad internal factions and cliques now fighting amongst themselves. We will put to good use the faction of the FP most loyal to our cause and integrate them within our command structure. Their experience shall now work to our benefit."
COG_issuethedraft:0 "Issue the Draft"
COG_issuethedraft_desc:0 "All men must serve! In times of great crisis we must institute conscription to defend our fragile state. This new blood shall wage war in defense of our newly independent state."
COG_securingarms:0 "Securing Weapons of War"
COG_securingarms_desc:0 "Without weaponry we can not wage war. We need every single rifle, artillery piece, and airplane we can muster to be used against our traitorous enemies. From old caches leftover from the colonialists to lucrative contacts in the Black Market, we shall reach far and wide to requisition weapons for our troops to do battle with."
COG_rallythecites:0 "Rally the Cities"
COG_rallythecites_desc:0 "Most of the Congo is a vast jungle, so any city under our control gives us an advantage over our enemies. We must secure as many cities within this vast archipelago of urban pockets amidst vast jungle expanses, and turn them into bastions of our regime’s will. Those who control the cities, control the Congo."
COG_theinternationalmarket:0 "Reach out to the International Market"
COG_theinternationalmarket_desc:0 "Congo is a land rich in natural resources, and the people of the world are eager to buy what we are selling. The profits from our natural wealth will be sure to help the War Effort. From legitimate contacts to less-than-savory dealers, all vendors will be looked at as we aim to arm every man in our army."
COG_confiscatingcivillianvehicles:0 "Confiscate Civilian Vehicles"
COG_confiscatingcivillianvehicles_desc:0 "In times of war, we can not afford any luxuries, and neither can our populace. Any vehicles that can be of use to the war effort must be requisitioned for military use. Every truck in the Congo will be used to transport and aid our military and their efforts against our numerous foes."
COG_salvagingthearsenals:0 "Salvage the Arsenals"
COG_salvagingthearsenals_desc:0 "What little industry is still undamaged in our area of control must be used to produce and maintain weaponry for the war effort. We can not let our arsenals fall to the hands of traitors. We must make makeshift repairs where we can and set-up ad hoc centers of industry and weaponsmithing when necessary, for without this domestic weaponsmithing ability, our hopes of defeating our enemies will be destroyed."
COG_embracelegitimacy:0 "Embrace a Legitimate Martial Tradition"
COG_embracelegitimacy_desc:0 "Only with a proud, sound, and tactical approach to military combat can we truly win out over our foes and forge a truly modern Congolese army. Our military will be proud and well-trained, and with them they will carry the hope of the people with them."
COG_embraceguerilla:0 "Embrace the Art of Guerilla War"
COG_embraceguerilla_desc:0 "This war or any future conflict can not be won through conventional means. The modern ways of warfare have failed to adapt to the Congo, so to win we must turn to guerilla tactics. Any force that tries to conquer us will be met with resistance to the bitter end. No one knows these jungles like we do!"
COG_uniteorsecede:0 "Our Place on the World Stage"
COG_uniteorsecede_desc:0 "Victory stands before us; the Congo is ours. Now that we have pacified this mighty land, we must look towards the future. Will we stand with the Entente, the Germans, the King, or the Kaiser? Or will we forge our own path in this world. We must decide soon."

### Ideas ###

COG_reliance_on_mercs_idea_desc:0 "The Congo has a long history of mercenary usage, but never has this usage been so prevalent as it is now. With our own officer corps being greatly understaffed and suffering from a critical lack of veteran’s experience, our armed forces heavily rely on mercenaries to fill in the many gaps within our military hierarchy. Though it is expensive, we have no alternative, and as long as our plunder piles remain stocked and these men paid, our state should run just fine.

COG_lack_of_resources:0 "Lack of Resources"
COG_lack_of_resources_desc:0 "With the UMHK’s decision to break off from the Vrijstaat, they have cut off their mines and factories to the wider Congo until this crisis has been resolved. Normally, one company closing its doors would not be too big an issue, but when a company that owns 70% of the national economy does it, it can cause some issues. Until we reclaim the lands of Haut Katanga, our state’s finances shall struggle, for without the Union Miniére, the Congo’s economy is nothing."

COG_post_war_devestation:0 "Post-War Devastation"
COG_post_war_devestation_desc:0 "War is a wicked thing. Not only does it cost the lives of our soldiers, but it also claims the lives of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. War maims, it burns, it destroys the very civilization we are trying to build and preserve, and this latest war was no different. The Congo now lay in a state of total disrepair, and our fragile nation is once more fractured and burning.

congo_crisis.1.d:0 "With the Congo Crisis raging and with our backs against the wall, we have found ourselves alone and outnumbered.

congo_crisis.2.t:0 "A Temporary Truce?"
congo_crisis.2.d:0 "Our neighboring non-colonial power has come to us offering a temporary ceasefire so that we may better focus on destroying the remnants of imperialism in this burning paradise. Though we will eventually be forced to turn on each other, this could buy us valuable time and free up enough men so that we can more swiftly crush the forces of the Vrijstaat and the Force Publique. How shall we reply?"

congo_crisis.4.t:0 "A Deal is Struck"
congo_crisis.4.d:0 "Our offer to temporarily cease all hostilities with our neighbor has been accepted, granting us both a small reprieve and a temporary ally in this conflict.

congo_news.1.d:0 "The violence and chaos of the Congo Civil War has finally abated, and despite all odds, the incumbent Flandro-Wallonian colonial regime has somehow survived it all and come out on top. Under Governor-General [COG.getleader], the Vrijstaat has defeated mercenaries, rogue paramilitaries, and the burning will for independence of the Congolese themselves - all turned to ash under the might of the Force Publique.\n\n It seems no matter the turmoil or effort, the Congo simply cannot shake their European overlords."
congo_news.1.a:0 "The more things change, the more they stay the same."

congo_news.3.t:0 "Congo United by the Faithful"
congo_news.3.d:0 "Though the Congo Crisis has seen the rise and fall of a vast myriad of factions, none could have predicted that the Nzungists, or Kimbanguists, would be the victors. Led by the Prophet, or Ngunza, Simon Kimbangu, this Baptist-influenced Afrianized Chrsitian sect has captivated the globe with recent reports that this holy man and his forces managed to conquer the warring factions of the Congo with both pen and sword, and now pushes to create a true and peaceful Eden at the heart of Africa.

congo_news.4.t:0 "Rogue Capitalists Seize the Congo"
congo_news.4.d:0 "The violence and chaos of the Congo Civil War have officially and finally come to an end today with the reports of a final ceasefire finally being negotiated in Leopoldville. The most recent reports coming in from that primordial expanse seem to point to the idea that the victors were not the nascent colonial regime nor the natives, but the monopolistic capitalists of the Flandro-Wallonian controlled mining conglomerate known as the Union Minière du Haut-Katanga, or the UMHK. This massive entity is now the single largest company in Africa, and now has the world’s attention as it must balance their pursuit of profit with the undertakings of running a state."

congo_news.5.t:0 "The Yeke Kingdom Rises Once More"
congo_news.5.d:0 "News from the Congo has trickled in and has depicted quite a peculiar tale as reports detail the rise of a group once thought fully exterminated - the forces of the Mwami. It seems that the constant defeats dealt by the hands of the Ryckmans regime earlier in the decade did not deal as large a blow to the Mwami’s power as once thought, and he and his forces have seemingly rebounded, surging forth from their jungle hiding spots and claiming victory in the Congo Civil War. Securing their base of power in their homelands in the southern region of Katanga, the oppressed Garanganze natives have allied with the wider Congolese native population and risen up throw out the Colonials, and now the world stands in awe as the once-extinct Yeke Kingdom rises from the pages of history."

congo_news.6.d:0 "The maelstrom that was the Congo Civil War has finally ended and it appears a new age has dawned in the Congo. Rebelling against the colonial government and fending off both rogue capitalists and violence-addicted mercenaries, the native Askari troops and democratic elements banded around the Young General Gonzague in the eastern region of Kivu have succeeded in their struggle for independence. Through blood, sweat, and sacrifice, the native Congolese have earned the right to determine their own fate, and have become one of the first fully independent and ‘stabilized’ nations in Post-Collapse Africa. Now the world waits to see if the Congolese can handle the burdens of modern nationhood."

congo_news.7.t:0 "Mercenaries Take the Congo!"
congo_news.7.d:0 "A notable development has occurred within the jungles of the Congo, for it appears the Mercenaries du Congo-Ouest have beaten back the various warring factions of the horrific Congo Crisis and now control the entirety of the Congo, in theory. In reality, according to insider reports, the Congo has been reduced to a disconnected fiefdom of warring mercenary factions all vying for control of this primordial expanse. What lies in store now for the Congo, and whether these soldiers can truly tame these wilds, remains to be seen, but the world shall watch with great interest as these soldiers and cutthroats attempt to rebuild a functioning society."

congo_news.8.d:0 "With the arrival of Franz Ritter von Epp to the Congo following the rising tensions and instabilities that have been brewing all across Mittelafrika, the new German-dominated regime has toiled and fought without end to consolidate their new regime. With their enemies now put down and with stability slowly returning to Africa’s Dark Heart, the Germans have come to fully dominate this primordial paradise. Now, the Congo lies as a direct colony of the Kaiserreich, swearing loyalty to only the Kaiser himself, and bowing neither to Dar-Es-Salaam or any other form of German authority. What von Epp and his lackeys will do with the Congo now though, is anyone’s guess..."

COG_reliance_on_mercs_idea_desc:0 "The Congo has a long history of mercenary usage, but never has this usage been so prevalent as it is now. With our own officer corps being greatly understaffed and suffering from a critical lack of veteran’s experience, our armed forces heavily rely on mercenaries to fill in the many gaps within our military hierarchy. Though it is expensive, we have no alternative, and as long as our plunder piles remain stocked and these men paid, our state should run just fine. If we run out of funds...well it is better not to imagine the chaos that would unfold."

COG_lack_of_resources:0 "Lack of Resources"
COG_lack_of_resources_desc:0 "With the UMHK’s decision to break off from the Vrijstaat, they have cut off their mines and factories to the wider Congo until this crisis has been resolved. Normally, one company closing its doors would not be too big an issue, but when a company that owns 70% of the national economy does it, it can cause some issues. Until we reclaim the lands of Haut Katanga, our state’s finances shall struggle, for without the Union Miniére, the Congo’s economy is nothing."

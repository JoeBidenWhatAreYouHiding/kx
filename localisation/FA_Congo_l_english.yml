All around us lie neighboring regions ripe for the taking, and so we must begin to prepare for war once more so that we may bring these lush regions into the fold. Arm the troops, rally the men, and let us make ready at once, for the cacophony of war shall soon be upon us yet again."

COG_reliance_on_mercs_idea:0 "Reliance on Mercenaries"
COG_reliance_on_mercs_idea_desc:0 "The Congo has a long history of mercenary usage, but never has this usage been so prevalent as it is now. With our own officer corps being greatly understaffed and suffering from a critical lack of veteran’s experience, our armed forces heavily rely on mercenaries to fill in the many gaps within our military hierarchy. Though it is expensive, we have no alternative, and as long as our plunder piles remain stocked and these men paid, our state should run just fine. If we run out of funds...well it is better not to imagine the chaos that would unfold."

COG_lack_of_resources:0 "Lack of Resources"
COG_lack_of_resources_desc:0 "With the UMHK’s decision to break off from the Vrijstaat, they have cut off their mines and factories to the wider Congo until this crisis has been resolved. Normally, one company closing its doors would not be too big an issue, but when a company that owns 70% of the national economy does it, it can cause some issues. Until we reclaim the lands of Haut Katanga, our state’s finances shall struggle, for without the Union Miniére, the Congo’s economy is nothing."

COG_post_war_devestation:0 "Post-War Devastation"
COG_post_war_devestation_desc:0 "War is a wicked thing. Not only does it cost the lives of our soldiers, but it also claims the lives of innocent civilians caught in the crossfire. War maims, it burns, it destroys the very civilization we are trying to build and preserve, and this latest war was no different. The Congo now lay in a state of total disrepair, and our fragile nation is once more fractured and burning. We must make haste and work to rebuild our great nation, for we can not fail them like the last government did."

COR:0 "Constitutional American Republic Focus Tree"

### Parties ###
COR_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - §LIt is bad enough that we have socialists and syndicalists in our nation, but the worst of all may be those who can loosely be called "totalists". These radicals advocate an authoritarian leftist government that would see our way of life snuffed out by force. Their platform has support with a significant enough part of our Black population to be threatening to us. We must do something about them...§!"
COR_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - §LThe syndicalist menace has come to our shores, in the form of the IWW and other organizations. One of the policies they advocate the most in our towns and cities is equal labor rights for the White man. Further, they seem to support greater integration of Blacks into society, perhaps even an eventual end to segregation. These policies would threaten the fabric of our society by pitting White against Black, Rich against Poor. These outside agitators have no right to tell us how to live our lives, for we can determine that just fine ourselves.§!"
COR_radical_socialist_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - §LThese bleeding-heart socialists may claim to care about all people, but we see past their thin veneer of ideology. If they cared about all people, why do they never address the poor Southern farmer, who is god-fearing and hard-working? No, what they really want to do is turn our Black population against us, and perhaps even cause a race war in the South! We cannot let them destroy our homes and our culture.§!"
COR_social_democrat_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - §LSo called "Federalist" members of the SPA, not supporters of the old government but those who support the ideology of social democracy, seem less radical than the other socialists on face value. Indeed, they support a more peaceful form segregation in our country, and some wish to return to an era where Blacks could vote. These beliefs are not entirely unreasonable, though we should attempt to negotiate with them, and convince them of our beliefs. With time, perhaps they could be redeemed and brought into the fold.§!"
COR_social_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Progressives) - §LThe Progressive Democrats are not a very common sight in our states, but they exist nonetheless. They represent the farthest left that the party is willing to go, oftentimes seeming more like Northern Republicans than other local Democrats. Their advocacy of a Social Security system, more education for Blacks, and free-trade oriented policies make them somewhat controversial, but they can be brought to the table nonetheless.§!"
COR_market_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Liberals) - §LMore liberally-minded Democrats are numerous in our towns and cities. These Democrats advocate for a laissez-faire economic system, charity for the poor, and a generally reduced government footprint in our society. These policies are agreeable, though they probably do not go far enough. Further, there are many who argue that total free-trade could put our economy in jeopardy. We should carefully consider their proposals and implement a select few into our government.§!"
COR_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Conservative) - §LThe Democratic Party has served us well in its long existence, but today it has morphed into an apparatus that no longer can support the interests of the White man. It is a husk of its old self, and most Democrats have now joined the ODP. However, the talented politician Richard Russell has plans for the party, and hopes to reshape it in his image. Perhaps more ambitiously, he wishes to win back the voters the old party of Andrew Jackson has lost as of late. To do so, he will need to face the daunting task of making the ODP irrelevant, and in the process, he will likely meet an old foe. His prospects may be bleak, but his relationship with William Murray and his adherence to most ODP politicies makes him a more than acceptable choice for us.§!"
COR_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Machines) - §LThe Democratic Party machines have controlled the South for decades. They have grown complacent in their success, ignoring the suffering of our poor farmers, especially recently. However, these politicians agree with us on most things, and they could easily be brought into the fold, if we promise them something resembling their old power. Instead of breaking this faction, we should bring them under our wing, and together we can bring a new age to America."
COR_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Old Democratic Party"
COR_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party - §LThe mainstream of the ODP all agree to support the interests of the White man while opposing Catholics, Jews, and Leftists. The supporters of the ODP come from both the Republican and the Democratic Party though, and within the party there are many disparate factions. Alfalfa Bill Murray is the leader of the party, for now, and he has unified most of them. However, Charles Lindbergh and the Fordists diverge from Murray in their greater support for corporatism, and there are some who wish to see George Patton lead the party as well. Murray will only be able to lead the party for so long, and when he is gone, the question of who will succeed him will be important indeed.§!"
COR_national_populist_party:0 "Old Democratic Party (NDWL)"
COR_national_populist_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party (National Democratic White League) - §LThe NDWL represents the various factions of the Ku Klux Klan as well  as the numerous White Leagues of our nation. Together, these two groups make up the backbone of the NDWL. However, this does not mean they all agree on the same message. William Joseph Simmons is generally agreed upon as their leader for now, but there are already many who are jockeying to succeed him. Hiram Wesley Evans, D.C. Stephenson, and Herbert W. Armstrong are the main contenders. Evans supports the newer branch of the Klan, while Stephenson represents the older branch. Meanwhile, Armstrong preaches unity between the two Klan factions, arguing that a different path can be followed.§!"

COR_national_corporatism_paternal_autocrat:0 "Old Democratic Party"
COR_national_corporatism_paternal_autocrat_long:0 "Old Democratic Party (National Corporatists) - §LThe traditionalist and agrarian mainstream of the ODP, dominated by Southern populists such as William H. Murray and Eugene Talmadge, has given way under the pressure of powerful Northern nationalists, with their money and influence turning the tide.\nThis newly dominant wing of the ODP, centred around the charisma and popularity of Charles Lindbergh and economics of Henry Ford, which has also absorbed the Republican Party's far-right fringe under Clare Hoffman, takes inspiration from the corporatist policies adopted by many rightist states around the world.\nPromoting a vision of American nationalism that is no less racist and anti-semitic than that of Murray's ODP, but is also much less Southern-centred and agrarian, the Fordists push for greater industrialization and a vision of the state that their opponents, including many in the KKK, see as emblematic of the Yankee elitism that the CAR rose up to fight.§!"

COR_old_klan_national_populist:0 "NDWL (Old Klan Faction)"
COR_old_klan_national_populist_long:0 "National Democratic White League (Old Klan Faction) - §LFollowing the death of William Joseph Simmons, the Old Klan, under the leadership of D.C. Stephenson, has emerged triumphant after an internal power struggle in the KKK that culminated in the deaths of Stephenson's rivals.\nAs opposed to the New Klan, which advocated a conciliatory attitude to some groups formerly attacked by the NDWL and sought to build a more orderly state, Stephenson's government is thoroughly uninterested in compromise, and sees the sole duty of the state as being the promotion of the interests of the White Race, a cause for which anything can be sacrificed.\nThe extreme violence of Stephenson's allies in the Black Legion, alongside the general contempt for legalism within his government, makes it likely that under "The Chief", America's ideals of the Rule of Law may be changed forever.§!"

COR_social_conservative_patton_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_conservative_patton_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - §LThe Democratic Party is in urgent need of reform. Luckily, Harry F. Byrd has agreed to rebuild the party in a way that Patton approves of, getting rid of party machines and their other corrupt practices. While they will remain separate from the Old Democratic Party, it will exist as an option for more moderate conservatives in the country, and with such support, may stand a chance of winning election someday.§!"

COR_market_liberal_patton_party:0 "Republican Party"
COR_market_liberal_patton_party_long:0 "Republican Party - §LThe conservative faction of the Republican Party has returned under the leadership of Strom Thurmond, who plans to remake the organization in his own image and hopefully carry it to victory someday.§!"

COR_social_liberal_patton_party:0 "Republican Party"
COR_social_liberal_patton_party_long:0 "Republican Party - §LThe liberal faction of the Republican Party is led by Joseph McCarthy who agreed to switch over from his old Democratic Party allegiance in order to help rebuild the Republican Party. Though he is still fairly conservative by mainstream standards, he is one of the most liberal members of American government now, and perhaps one day he will even lead the country.§!"

COR_social_democrat_patton_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_democrat_patton_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - §LThe more liberal faction of the Democratic Party will be led by James Francis Byrnes. Not a liberal by any means, he is still more open to government intervention and stimulus programs than someone like Harry F. Byrd. As such, he has been deemed as sufficient to lead the liberal wing of the party, perhaps rebuilding it from ruin and leading it to victory one day.§!"

COR_authoritarian_democrat_patton_party:0 "Old Democratic Party (Patton)"
COR_authoritarian_democrat_patton_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party - §LGeorge S. Patton has taken leadership over the ODP and plans to lead it in a different fashion to his predecessor, "Alfalfa" Bill Murray. Patton, yearning for the America of old, styles himself as the president, and hopes to ease some of the restrictions Murray placed on the country, though the specifics of these are as of yet unknown. However, it is true that Patton has a program to instill discipline into the country to help it rebuild and prosper once more. With Patton in charge, there will be stability at last.§!"

COR_national_populist_armstrong_party:0 "NDWL (Church of Zion)"
COR_national_populist_armstrong_party_long:0 "National Democratic White League (Church of Zion) - §LFollowing the death of William Joseph Simmons the Holy Church of Zion, under the leadership of Herbert W. Armstrong, has emerged triumphant after an internal power struggle.\nWith the rightful place secured at last for the true Apostle and Prophet of God all of America will be transformed to fit the mold of Christian Identity laid out by Armstrong's Evangelion. No papist, racial inferior, false Hebrew or Eve's harlot offspring shall escape the eyes of Jacob and the wrath of Elijah.§!"

### Leader Bios ###
##Constitutional American Republic##
POLITICS_WILLIAM_JOSEPH_SIMMONS:0 "Once, the Ku Klux Klan was as good as dead. Nothing but a fraternal organization from long ago. However, things change. The film “The Birth of a Nation” injected new lifeblood into the KKK, painting them as a heroic force protecting the white race. The KKK was to be reborn, and Simmons was to head this revived Klan. As America deteriorated, the Klan sided with Murray and the Constitutional American Republic and grew as a significant internal faction. Now, with Murray gone the Klan and the National Democratic White League has taken power, and  Simmons will shape America in his radical vision. "
POLITICS_WILLIAM_H_MURRAY_DESC:0 "William Henry Davis Murray, better known as “Alfalfa Bill” has quite the life under his belt. Born on a farm in Texas, little would expect that Murray would end up where he is today, his life being unremarkable for the first years of his life. His first introduction into politics was as a campaigner and in a failed run for Senate. However, Murray took to politics, being a skilled orator and lawyer. Through alliances, he rose through the political ranks until he was elected Governor of Oklahoma. This sent him to the forefront of national politics and pitted him against Garner and the “Moderate” Democrats. Eventually, Murray split from the traditional Democrats and founded the “Old Democrat Party”, which gained support from the Far-Right all across America. Now, President Murray must fight for his allies, for America, and for the White Race. "
POLITICS_HERBERT_W_ARMSTRONG_DESC:0 "Herbert W. Armstrong, the Apostle of Christ. The black sheep of the NWDL leadership, little would have predicted that he would have been the one to succeed Simmons as leader of America; yet here he is. His early life was influenced by the church, his lengthy study of the bible beginning after a challenge from his wife to find proof that Sunday was the Sabbath. As his fanaticism grew, god himself began to influence him, opening his mind to new truths not accepted by the masses. Soon enough he began his own church and began broadcasting his sermons on the radio, something that garnered him a large following.  As America collapsed, Armstrong Denounced Reed and Long as the Beast and False Prophet and declared his allegiance to the Constitutional American Republic. And with a power struggle that ensured after the death of the American Emperor, Armstrong took the reigns of America. Under his watch, America will truly be God’s land."
POLITICS_FRANCIS_PARKER_YOCKEY_DESC:0 "Francis Parker Yockey, an up-and-coming member of the Young Klan, has led a coup against Herbert W. Armstrong. Yockey, though young, has taken inspiration from various spiritual and political figures in Europe who call for the erasure of the Enlightenment and Liberal values that characterized the previous century. Instead, Yockey hopes to establish a new age of authoritarian rule in America, which he views as the bastion of old values. To help him achieve this goal, he hopes to eliminate the power of the worst "Culture Distorting" and "Cultural Parasite" groups, namely racial and religious minorities in the country. Concurrent with this goal is the wider aim of unifying the Western world into an Imperium of Europe, which Yockey believes is the only way to save his people from certain destruction. To save the West, Yockey will become the ultimate authority over a united European and American civilization, and through the success of this task, we will finally have peace. Though this will be no easy task, Yockey's pragmatism and willingness to work with unlikely allies makes what seems to be an impossible goal into an ambitious but desparate attempt to save the world."
POLITICS_GEORGE_LINCOLN_ROCKWELL_DESC:0 "George Lincoln Rockwell, the young but idealistic leader of the Young Klan, has successfully wrested control of the country from Herbert W. Armstrong. Rockwell, unable to tolerate Armstrong's policies, has his own plans for the country at large. He hopes to reorganize society under what he believes to be the laws of nature, or the tribe. Further, he believes himself to be the true embodiment of the values of the Founding Fathers, and he fully intends to carry out their will in establishing an authoritarian state to maintain order and cleanse the country of its old corruption. An avid nationalist, Rockwell intends to separate minority groups who do not fit within the colonial definition of an American. Through these means, America will be a country for its own citizens once more, and the invasion of outside groups will be turned back. To accomplish these goals, Rockwell plans to use a robust media and propaganda apparatus that takes advantage of his own charisma as well as the passion of his followers to demonstrate the necessity of their actions. It will not be an easy road to free America from its shackles, but Rockwell believes he has just what he needs to rouse the American people from their slumber and call them to final action against those who would see them destroyed."
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSEL_DESC:0 "Born in Winder, Georgia on November 2nd, 1897 to a wealthy family, Richard Russell Jr. is fairly young. Russell began his career as a Democrat, and has stayed true to that party even through the rise of the Old Democratic Party under Alfalfa Bill Murray. However, his meteoric rise in Georgia politics has meant that he is at the center of the new Constitutional American Republic. Beginning as a member of the Georgia House of Representatives and then making his way to the position of governor, he became the most powerful man in the state. However, he only served as governor for two years, vacating his post to run for the U.S. Senate instead. He was succeeded as governor by Eugene Talmadge, a fiery orator whose Old Democratic leanings have put him at odds with Russell. Indeed, the two man have develeoped a bitter rivalry over the past few years, the culmination of which occurred in the 1936 election, in which Talmadge challenged Russell for his senate seat. Talmadge, articulating a powerful racial message, lost to the more economically focused Russell, but their rivalry is stronger than ever. Regardless, because the capital of the Constitutional American Republic is in Atlanta, Richard Russell has had considerable influence over the Constitutional American Republic, despite his status as a Democrat. His beliefs are more in line with Murray than the beliefs of Talmadge or many other Old Democrats, and the two have recently developed a sort of friendship. Russell wholeheartedly agrees with Murray's slogan of fighting "Corporations, Communism, and Miscegenation", despite his aristocratic background. In fact, Russell has always been a populist in both rhetoric and policy, always legislating for the sake of his people, not the wealthy. Now that he leads the nation, he must outthink the enemies who surround him at every turn while also finding a way to save his country. Clever politican and genuine populist that he is, he is perhaps the one man who can achieve these goals." 
POLITICS_EUGENE_TALMADGE_DESC:0 "Eugene Talmadge was born on Sep 23th 1884 in Forsyth, Georgia. Going to the University of Georgia’s law school and being a part of groups such as the Sigma Nu fraternity, Talmadge began his pursuit for a political career. Running multiple times for Georgia's state legislature and losing, Talmadge became a democratic commissioner for the state’s agriculture. Despite these seeming failures, Talmadge made full use of spreading his rhetoric and influence among Georgia’s rural population. Utilizing his popularity, he eventually won the candidacy for Georgia’s governorship. Only joining the Old Democratic Party in ‘36, he made sure to sweep Georgia up in a tide of rhetoric once the civil war began, starting a wave of southern pride not seen since the civil war. While within the politics of the Old Democrats, Talmadge was not trusted with his late entrance to the party, and with the establishment seeing him as an extremist with his support for even further segregation and racial laws. Despite this seeming uphill battle, Talmadge seemed to convince Murray with his rhetoric as Murray assigned him as his successor. Now in charge of the nation, Talmadge has full reins to change the country as he sees fit."
COR_STROM_THURMOND_DESC:0 "James Strom Thurmond was born on Dec 05, 1902 in Edgefield,South Carolina. Thurmond has served a variety of jobs, From farmer to teacher and coach, before becoming a Judge for his hometown. Forming populist rhetoric at seeing the poor conditions these career’s were going through during the depression, Thurmond eventually rose to the South Carolina Senate. Serving as a staunch segregationist yet still firm populist, Thurmond was among the Old Democrats throughout his young politician years. Throughout the Civil War Thurmond remained with the ODP,  constantly gaining support for the war effort with his charismatic fervor and gaining the eye of Murray for his support of the cause. Although they were somewhat split ideologically with Strom’s support for welfare, Murray propelled him forth in a surprise move when he designated him his successor. Now in charge of the Nation, Strom Thurmond must fight for his promises of welfare for the common man in an establishment that is still uncertain of the Young populist leader."
POLITICS_JOHN_RANKIN_DESC:0 "John E Rankin was born on March 29th, 1882 in Itawamba county, Mississippi. Going to Law school in Mississippi, Rankin eventually got elected to congress as a Democrat from it’s first district. Serving multiple terms in congress, it wasn’t until the eventual instability of the Great Depression that Rankin, Murray and other southern Democrats formed the Old Democratic Party. Serving as a part of the establishing ODP members, Rankin eventually got selected as Murray’s Vice president in the 1936 elections. Continuing to be Murray’s right hand man, he served faithfully, as his uncharismatic yet loyal nature proved him to be a good workhouse in the politics of the Constitutional American Republic. Now with Murray out of the picture, Rankin is the head of the government as his successor. How he will run the nation is yet to be seen, as so far it seems he will stick to the establishment and Murray’s previous ideals." 
POLITICS_GEORGE_PATTON_DESC:0 "George Smith Patton, popularly called "Old Blood and Guts", was once a rising star in the U.S. Army, but his fortunes changed rather quickly. Now, Patton heads the army of the Constitutional American Republic, fighting to save the country from syndicalists, populists, and any other traitors who decide to show their ugly faces. Officially a member of the ODP, Patton has never liked politics much, but most of "Alfalfa" Bill Murray's views were in line with his own, and the two developed a friendship. From the beginning, Murray was quick to recognize Patton's talent, and he made him one of his top advisors. Now that Patton leads the party, he plans to leave most of the day-to-day administration work to his vice president and cabinet, opting instead to try and place the country on the road to recovery through guts, discipline, and hard work. This road is sure to be a hard one, as Patton believes this battle, like any other, will be lost as soon as the initiative is gone. As such, the American people will be pushed hard, but Patton aims to set an example by working hard himself, barnstorming the country with inspirational speeches designed to restore morale. Although he is an outspoken racist and a conservative through and through, Patton is different from his fellow politicians in that his focus is on America, not the South, and he has no love for the proposals of the Ku Klux Klan or the Fordists. He is instead expected to take a more moderate approach to politics, more in line with Murray. His foremost concern is to keep the old America alive, an America there was no such thing as a coward, and he plans to pursue this goal with much enthusiasm."
POLITICS_CHARLES_LINDBERGH:0 "Charles Lindbergh, or Lindy, was once the most famous pilot in America. Lindbergh's fame grew well into the 1920s in service of the US Air Mail Service. This coupled with a knack for improving planes that eventually grew into a business made Lindbergh even more famous. Lindbergh's association with the AFP starting in 1932, and escalated until he made contact with the War Power Committee. Eventually picked out of the Committee to be their next leader, Lindbergh intends to continue Murray's racialist positions and to encourage industrial innovations through example."
POLITICS_DC_STEPHENSON_DESC:0 "Nobody in their right mind would predict that David Curtiss Stephenson would ever lead America. His attempts with politics all failing miserably. But even though politics failed for him, Stephenson would still achieve power through the revived Ku Klux Klan, joining and rapidly rising through the ranks of the Indiana Klan. Eventually he would become Grand Dragon of Indiana, and command terrifying amounts of power in the Midwestern United States. As the Klan grew in power nationwide, so did the list of Stephenson’s enemies. Stephenson was the victim of numerous assassination attempts. These assassination attempts, along with Wilson’s softer hand on the Klan lead to Stephenson avoiding meaningful consequences for his actions. As America collapsed, the Klan and the NWDL sided with the CAR, and with the death of William J. Simmons, Stephenson is the man now poised to lead America into the future. "
POLITICS_HIRAM_WESLEY_EVANS_DESC:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans is a man who cares little for anything but power. The first parts of his life were relatively unremarkable, growing up as a normal child in Alabama and eventually moving to Texas where he became a dentist. However, Evans had massive ambitions and speaking skills to match, and with his admission into the Ku Klux Klan his path to power was becoming apparent. Even though he was not opposed to Lynching’s and even took place in them, he became vehemently opposed to them as he feared that they would give the Klan a bad image. Through the years, Evans grew to be in the highest echelons of Klan leadership, eventually becoming poised to take over upon the death of William J. Simmons. Now in charge, he promised reforms without selling out to Liberals or Socialists. Though, many comment that he cares little for ideology, only money and power. "
POLITICS_RICHARD_RUSSEL_DESC:0 "Born in Winder, Georgia on November 2nd, 1897 to a wealthy family, Richard Russell Jr. is fairly young.

POLITICS_CRUMP_DESC:0 "Rising from relative obscurity to now dominating the politics of this new America, Edward Hull Crump is one of the more peculiar men in the hierarchy of this fine nation. Born in Mississippi in 1874, Crump moved to Memphis, Tennessee to find work during the great Panic of 1893. Falling in with the Walter Goodman Cotton Company, Crump began his path towards being a successful broker and trader at just 19 years old, allowing him to court one of the city’s greatest socialites, only raising his position in his new native home. Using his new place in society and successes in finance to kickstart his own political career, Crump began as a delegate in the Tennessee Democratic State Convention in 1902 before rising through the municipal hierarchy of Memphis. With a mass of support and political connections forming beneath him, and seeking to distance himself from the established capital elite, Crump began forming his own political machine which would eventually grow and carry him to the Mayor’s office. From Mayor of Memphis to State Representative, Crump continued to climb high in state politics, utilizing a mixture of corruption, populism, and a friendly relationship with Black voters to carry him to ever-higher successes. Ruling Memphis as his own personal fiefdom, Boss Crump continued to pull at the strings of Tennessee state politics until the chaos that led to this new Civil War. Seizing newfound opportunities to take total control of this new America, Crump promised to bring back voting rights for the recently disenfranchised Black population of the South in order to secure his popularity as well as his attempt to seize power from former President Russell. Now in charge of something far larger than his previous domain, this big fish has been tossed into a far larger pond, and it is now up to Crump to utilize his same old tricks to maintain his grip on power."

### Ideas ###
COR_black_legion_resistance:0 "Old Klan Resistance"
COR_black_legion_resistance_desc:0 "The Black Legion is out of control, and now resists our government. While we admire them, their ideas are outdated and their outlook is old. It is a new era, and only the Young Klan can succeed!"
COR_black_nationalist_1_idea:0 "Black Resistance"
COR_black_nationalist_1_idea_desc:0 "There has been a significant increase in tensions with our Black community. Some of the more bold members of the community have even taken up arms against us, and others damage our infrastructure to weaken us. We should work to put this group in their place." 
COR_longist_resistance_1_idea:0 "Longist Resistance"
COR_longist_resistance_1_idea_desc:0 "The Unionists claim to represent the common man, farmers in particular, but they do not represent Dixie. Their radical ideas would threaten everything we believe in. Particularly, some of their left wing elements are advocating for the dismantlement of the old Jim Crow system. These rebels must be stopped!"
COR_mob_activity_1_idea:0 "Mob Activity"
COR_mob_activity_1_idea_desc:0 "Some of the criminal scum that have ravaged our nation for years are now targeting our government. Particularly, they have used alcohol as a tool to gain immense power and wealth in our borders. If these thugs aren't stopped, they could destroy the very fabric of our society."
COR_syndicalist_resistance_1_idea:0 "Syndicalist Resistance"
COR_syndicalist_resistance_1_idea_desc:0 "The radical syndicalists, in addition to other leftists, have done considerable damage to our country. Now, they are targeting us, trying to snuff our beloved country out and replace it with an abomination. We should have no mercy for these people, and anytime one is found, they should be severely punished, if not hanged, for their actions."
COR_federalist_activity_1_idea:0 "Federalist Activity"
COR_federalist_activity_1_idea_desc:0 "The Feds had their chance to run this country, and they blew it. Now, they are fighting against our government, trying to make sure we are as much of a failure as they were. We can't let them succeed. We should work to snuff out Federalist resistance and convince our people that our government is the legitimate one."
COR_fighting_for_car_idea:0 "Fighting for the CAR"
COR_jim_crow_idea:0 "Jim Crow"
COR_jim_crow_idea_desc:0 "Named for a popular caricature of a stereotypical black slave that went on to become a pejorative for black Americans more generally, the Jim Crow Laws are an intense form of racial segregation with the goal of promoting white supremacy. Virtually all public facilities are segregated, interracial marriage is banned and black Americans are often used for cheap labor. This allows us access to cheap resource extraction, an easy means of empowering our supporters and the sympathy of hardline white supremacists throughout the nation. However, this comes at the cost of our widespread loathing among blacks, other minorities and non-white supremacists more generally which not only means they are loathe to join the military but that manpower has to be put forward to prevent rebellion. Furthermore, our economy's lowered pool of human capital and high reliance on simple labor-intensive resource extraction slows economic and technological advancement in most other areas."
COR_jim_crow_idea_2:0 "National Jim Crow"
COR_jim_crow_idea_2_desc:0 "With the executive better coordinating the Old Democratic Party's racial policies by state and shifting resources appropriately, alongside the encouragement of new counter-espionage methods, we have streamlined the Jim Crow system to be more efficient for the state and lowered the possibility of resistance. Segregation shall remain the norm in the CAR today, tomorrow and (with the ODP in command) forever!"
COR_native_collaboration:0 "Native Collaboration"
CON_native_collaboration_desc:0 "With the granting of greater autonomy and even a new state to friendly Native American tribes we ensure their support in the form of political backing of our wing of the ODP and requested recruits eager to defend their new alliance."
COR_cavalier_ideal_idea:0 "Cavalier Idealism"
COR_cavalier_ideal_idea_desc:0 "Our veneration of Cavalier heroism and culture via the schooling and military process as well as in the public square has not only been a massive moral boost to our soldiers but should gradually induce a white population more willing to fight for its new rights and to embrace our values."
COR_state_militants:0 "Old Democratic State Militias"
COR_state_militants_desc:0 "With each state being entrusted to raise militias for internal control our national army not only has had its resources freed up but we can call upon these governors for support when the need arises, many of whom are especially skilled and fervent while fighting on their own land."
COR_old_dem_schools:0 "Proper Education"
COR_old_dem_schools_desc:0 "For too long, our schools have been infested with lies about American history. It is time that we overhauled the system and expanded it to rural areas so that all of our children can access the education they need to succeed in the society we are building. More importantly, we must teach our children our values so that they do not fall prey to syndicalism or other forms of vile propaganda aimed at destroying the very fabric of our culture!"
COR_afforable_goods:0 "Affordable Goods"
COR_afforable_goods_desc:0 "The state wrangling of utilities to lower their prices to consumers, especially those that are apart of the ODP's base, has done much to ease our citizens economic discomfort."
COR_old_democrat_education:0 "Educating Rural Whites"
COR_controlled_klan:0 "Controlled Klan"
COR_old_dem_dominance:0 "Jacksonian Dominance"
COR_old_dem_dominance_desc:0 "The Democratic Party was great in the days of Andrew Jackson. Since then, the party has fallen far from its old glory, and we must restore us. Let us continue the party in the tradition of Jackson and sweep away the corruption that has enveloped it since then. We will be a party of the common man, the white man, once more!" 
COR_farmers_relief:0 "Farmer's Relief Program"
COR_farmers_relief_desc:0 "Southern yeoman farmers and the agricultural workers of the nation as a whole have suffered mightily in recent years. We should work to subsidize and provide relief to this crucial group, and the national economy will prosper as a result of it." 
COR_increased_farmers_relief:0 "Further Relief for Farmers"
COR_increased_farmers_relief_desc:0 "Our programs have greatly benefited farmers thus far, and with the addition of school lunch programs for students, they will no longer be obligated to feed students on their own should they choose not to. This will allow them to sell more to the market and allow students more nutrition during the day."
COR_weaken_machines:0 "Weakening Party Machines"
COR_weaken_machines_desc:0 "The process of weakening Democratic party machines to re-attract ODP voters will take some time, but once we have succeeded in eliminating or at least weakening some of these organizations, we will enjoy increased support."
COR_honest_governance:0 "Honest Governance"
COR_honest_governance_desc:0 "With the most corrupt party machines now eliminated, we now not only benefit from increased support from former ODP voters, but also more efficiency in our government."
COR_agricultural_research_idea:0 "Agricultural Research"
COR_cut_bloated_government:0 "Efficient Governance"
COR_cut_bloated_government_desc:0 "With the inefficiency and corruption rooted out of various government programs, the government will function better than ever before, even if it is smaller than it was."
COR_university_system_idea:0 "University System of America"
COR_university_system_idea_desc:0 "Building off his University System of Georgia, Russell has decided to implement this program on a national stage, and the fruits of it will soon be observed."
COR_fiscal_responsability_idea:0 "Fiscal Responsibility"
COR_rural_heritage_idea:0 "Rural Heritage"
COR_rural_heritage_idea_desc:0 "We have embraced our agricultural history, and this comes with many benefits. The only downside is that with more work to do on farms, some potential soldiers will be needed there more than on the front, and will take longer to train."
COR_immigration_limit_idea:0 "Immigration Limits"
COR_nationalist_effort:0 "The Southern Bloc"
COR_nationalist_effort_desc:0 "With the South being brought closer to the rest of the nation, our country as a whole can prosper!"
COR_southern_fordists_idea:0 "Supporting Southern Fordists"
COR_southern_fordists_idea_desc:0 "We have taken measures to combat the Northern Fordists who have been such a thorn in our side, but we had to replace them in some way. The best solution seems to be to prop up patriotic Southern Fordists while denouncing the rebellious Northern ones. It will take some time to make up for what we have lost, but we will be more stable for it in the long run."
COR_southern_fordists_idea_2:0 "Renewed Industrial Support"
COR_southern_fordists_idea_2_desc:0 "With both Southern Fordists and the more moderate Northern Fordists supporting us, we have marginalized Ford's most fanatic followers and can now say we have the support of industry in our nation!"
COR_southern_fordists_idea_3:0 "Patriotic Corporations"
COR_southern_fordists_idea_3_desc:0 "We have brought the remaining Fordists and other corporations in our nation to heel and will now ensure they work for the betterment of our country, not for their own greed, though we will of course encourage profit. The aim is to ensure that corporations cannot interfere in our government and make things inefficient, which Russell believes they had done-until now."
COR_political_rival_farmer:0 "Political Rivalry"
COR_political_rival_farmer_desc:0 "We have decided to appeal to farmers in order to eliminate Talmadge as a rival, though it will take some time to completely discredit him in the minds of our supporters."
COR_political_rival_farmer_2:0 "Popular Victory"
COR_political_rival_farmer_2_desc:0 "We have cut Talmadge off from his base of support and instead brought them to our side instead through economic policies. While this has neutered our rival for now, he still has support among the ODP party apparatus, and he may return at some point."
COR_political_rival_trap:0 "Ongoing Conflict"
COR_political_rival_trap_desc:0 "Though our racial appeals have stolen some support from Talmadge, we have bought into his framework, and it is one that he is ultimately more skilled in. For his part, Russell is uncomfortable engaging in racial discourses, and it seems that there is no end in sight to the rivalry between the president and Eugene Talmadge." 
COR_political_rival_odp:0 "Political Rivalry"
COR_political_rival_odp_desc:0 "We have decided to offer power and positions to Talmadge's rivals within the ODP in exchange for their forcing him out of the party, but he will still be popular among his supporters."
COR_political_rival_odp_2:0 "Political Victory"
COR_political_rival_odp_2_desc:0 "We have successfully undermined Talmadge within the ODP and given power to his rivals instead. These rivals support us now, and our government will be more stable for it. Talmadge himself has fled for now, and it is possible that he may return one day, given he still enjoys support among the people."
COR_old_klan_revolts:0 "Old Klan Revolts!"
COR_old_klan_revolts_desc:0 "Our attempts to play kingmaker in the NDWL have been successful, but have also caused significant backlash among the Old Klan, particularly the Black Legion. It seems they will be a thorn in our side for quite some time..."
COR_yellow_cowards_idea:0 "Root out Cowards"
COR_yellow_cowards_idea_2:0 "National Discipline"
COR_yellow_cowards_idea_3:0 "American Values"
COR_yellow_cowards_idea_3_desc:0 "The American values of the Wild West should be tempered by the older American idea of a Protestant work ethic, and together, the two can create a society of morality, hard work, and toughness."
COR_yellow_cowards_idea_4:0 "Unbroken Spirit"
COR_yellow_cowards_idea_4_desc:0 "America has been torn apart in recent years, and yet the spirit of her people is unbroken. George S. Patton has taken America through a program not unlike the boot camps his men have gone through, but it has paid off, and now the country is ready for recovery. More brave, patriotic, and disciplined than ever before, Americans stand ready to leap into a new age of prosperity."

Long live the Old Democrats!"
COR_root_out_carpetbaggers:0 "Carpetbaggers and Scalawags"
COR_root_out_carpetbaggers_desc:0 "Criminals and socialists within white communities continue to sabotage us without end. The new Democratic Security League will recruit from our most trustworthy supporters in the National Guard, Military, and White Leagues. They will focus on countering wealthier elements of society used to bribing their way out of trouble from coordinating with radicals and criminals, starting with unpatriotic capitalists."
COR_tax_commissioners:0 "Tax Commissioners"
COR_tax_commissioners_desc:0 "With the creation of our state, there is a demand for revenue, but none want to provide it. Many in territories we lack a strong hold are attempting to weasel out of any payments, out of either greed or spite. Rather than raise taxes on our own loyal citizens, we should expand the training and recruitment of tax commissioners, to make sure every cent that should be paid will be."
COR_american_guard:0 "Expand the Guard"
COR_american_guard_desc:0 "The ODP has been heavily reliant on its National Guard as a source of manpower rather than the more... ambitious White Leaguers. We should fuel the building blocks of our military base by expanding recruitment into the guard through a youth campaign, and a small hike in the gasoline excise tax to help pay for it."
COR_political_machine:0 "New Political Machines"
COR_political_machine_desc:0 "It is time for the ODP to expand into the rest of America. Only through continuing to build on the current model of making alliances with potential allies and building white political machines can we reliably grow the party. The lower offices of the government shall only allow ODP-friendly candidates to run. The higher ones will be reliably chosen by patriotic party bosses with the Chief's input when needed."
COR_martial_law:0 "Martial Law"
COR_martial_law_desc:0 "We have finally mustered the power to declare national martial law! America is in crisis and only Military Command and the National Guard can fix it, with them being placed in command of both subversive areas and regions needing relief aid with more leeway. This includes being allowed to set curfews and the right to jail traitors without trial until our national disaster is over."
COR_jim_crows_america:0 "Defending Jim Crow"
COR_jim_crows_america_desc:0 "Separating the White from the Black is a foundation of our society if we are to preserve the values, and race, this nation was founded on. To maintain the Jim Crow system beyond the South, it will need to be streamlined with additional funding for security forces, more uniform standards across the ODP, and larger payoffs to those who report anti-white radicalism."
COR_break_banksterism:0 "Break Banksterism"
COR_break_banksterism_desc:0 "The banksters and money-lenders have been a plague on this nation since before Andrew Jackson had to break up the Second National Bank. We will break foreign, Yankee, and Scalawag monopolies on banking by forcing banks to break apart into smaller sizes and be regularly audited by the tax commissioners. Banks owned by foreigners and Jews outside their own communities shall be repossessed."
COR_land_of_our_fathers:0 "Land of our Fathers"
COR_land_of_our_fathers_desc:0 "Our farmers have suffered from the Great Panic and Civil War brought on by cosmopolitan bureaucrats, not to speak of the droughts. It is time to finally give them the relief they need. We will provide whites with the farm goods they need, electricity and help clean up lands that could potentially be used for farming. America shall once again be the land of Yeoman Farmer."
COR_oil_oligarchy:0 "Oil Oligarchy"
COR_oil_oligarchy_desc:0 "We have all the resources we need right here in the states to enrich the nation, but overwhelmingly, the benefits either go to too few or opportunities to drill oil are missed. All existing loyalist oil companies will be combined into the National American Oil Company, a conglomerate the government will have a majority share in and will aid through infrastructure projects."
COR_push_up_prices:0 "Push Up Prices"
COR_push_up_prices_desc:0 "With our increasingly large monopoly on oil, it's time we used it for the public good. We will increase the prices on our oil exports and use the funding for new public projects while forcing other nations to pay their fair share."
COR_convict_leasing:0 "Convict Leasing"
COR_convict_leasing_desc:0 "The time has come for those who have taken from society to finally give back. Our National Prison Administration will begin coordinating with the national government and approved companies for contracts that will contribute to the common good, starting with a mass infrastructure. With the introduction of the Black Laws we should not suffer a shortage of prisoners."
COR_loyal_governors:0 "Loyal Governors"
COR_loyal_governors_desc:0 "The ODP needs to more directly control its reach in states its taken while edging out either the fence-sitters or the most fanatical NDWL members who do not fully respect the current President's authority. The ODP will appoint emergency governors for every state not currently trusted or not fully controlled."
COR_cavalier_ideal:0 "Cavalier Ideal"
COR_cavalier_ideal_desc:0 "In forgetting our ideals, many throughout the nation have begun admiring socialist fanatics or cowardly politicians. Let us return to the ideal, the Cavalier soldier who stood by the nation with a stiff upper-lip and a sense of honor. A campaign on behalf of the cavalier ideal, educational and otherwise, will create a more unified, tough nation."
COR_patriotic_states:0 "Militias of the State"
COR_patriotic_states_desc:0 "Our Founders understood that state militias were a central part of our national liberty and defense but unfortunately traitors have sought to abuse this by turning state militias into weapons for anti-American extremists. Let the ODP militias raised on a state-level be loyal to the party, the people and the American Nation."
COR_agrarian_taxes:0 "Bread, Butter, Bacon and Beans"
COR_agrarian_taxes_desc:0 "The ODP understands that the farmer and the worker are the backbone of our nation more than any so-called socialist does. A combination of lower taxes for farmers, increased taxes on businessmen and negotiated lower prices with utility companies by encouraging states to buy in-bulk from pro-ODP companies will bring them prosperity."
COR_white_education:0 "Patriotic Education"
COR_white_education_desc:0 "Our education system was poisoned, with the academy in particular becoming a hivemind for cosmopolitanism, Marxism and social radicalism while remaining hostile to traditionalism. The ODP will restructure education and positions to teach them traditionalism, nationalism and the threat posed by our internal enemies while removing anti-American literature."
COR_controlled_klan:0 "Regulated Klan"
COR_controlled_klan_desc:0 "While the effort of the White Leagues and particularly the Klan in aiding the CAR to achieve victory over our various foes is unquestionable, many of their leaders desire more autonomy than is healthy for the state. Worse, it seems that their vigilante nature betrays a disregard for the law. The Klan will now become a regulated entity with guidelines to follow and their most violent behavior reigned in."
COR_deport_syndicalist_hordes:0 "Deport Syndicalist Hordes"
COR_deport_syndicalist_hordes_desc:0 "The political machines and socialists were more than happy to mongrelize America and import loyal voters from various nations but no more! Every immigrant from a foreign nation with a hostile government that has not already sworn total loyalty to the CAR will be forced to go home."
COR_legacy_of_jackson:0 "Legacy of Jackson"
COR_legacy_of_jackson_desc:0 "We have created a true America that represents the core principles of the nation, now let us ensure the ODP never forget its mission by rapidly expanding white membership and participation via a recruitment drive and party restructuring to better connect local leaders to the state and national heads, ensuring the dominance of Jacksonian Democracy and the true heirs to his Democratic Party."
COR_peoples_senator:0 "The People's Senator"
COR_peoples_senator_desc:0 "The wealthy but populist-minded Senator Richard Russell Jr. of Georgia has been a Democrat his whole life, and served as one in his time as governor and then senator. However, when the South revolted against the national government under William Murray's leadership, Russell, ever the clever politician, threw his lot in with the Constitutional American Republic. Now having achieved victory over his rivals, he seeks to use government aid to relieve the nation of it's economic woes, focusing on farmers especially. Only time will tell whether his efforts will be successful."
COR_southern_stimulus:0 "Southern Stimulus"
COR_southern_stimulus_desc:0 "Although he is a proponent of a balanced budget and generally a fiscal conservative, Russell believes the current economic crisis can only be ameliorated through government aid for farmers in the nation. His plans involve taking on the Boll Weevil crisis, granting farm loans, creating a system of old-age pensions, and instituting a new income tax to pay for these programs."
COR_tackle_corruption:0 "Tackle Corruption"
COR_tackle_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption was one of the main reasons the Democratic Party split in the first place. Now in power, Richard Russell hopes to take on this corruption directly and eliminate as much of it as he possibly can. At stake is the national budget and the future of this country. If we can eliminate the influence of the wealthy on our politics, perhaps we can begin to recover..."
COR_segregation_now:0 "Status Quo Jim Crow"
COR_segregation_now_desc:0 "The Jim Crow laws that have been in place for decades are here to stay. President Russell typically avoids the race question, but when he does address it, it is clear that he is a firm White supremacist who wishes to keep the status quo. However, his unwillingness to discuss the issue or even take some of the measures of Jim Crow further has caused tensions with the NDWL and some of the ODP."
COR_new_democrats:0 "New Democrats"
COR_new_democrats_desc:0 "Efforts to reunify the breakoff ODP with the Democratic Party should be undertaken to ensure we have enough support in the country to enact our policies. This will be no easy task; many of the Old Democrats left the party with complaints of corruption or weakness, and these qualities must be rooted out before they will be willing to rejoin. President Russell has already undertaken measures to this end, forcing the most corrupt officials to resign, but some stubbornly resist..."
COR_good_politics:0 "It's Only Good Politics..."
COR_good_politics_desc:0 "Eugene Talmadge has been a thorn in Richard Russell's side for years, and now the time has come to deal with him once and for all. He is now cut off from his main support system, and with evidence of his ties to wealthy Northeastern donors and Wall Street, we can end his career once and for all."
COR_agriculture_research:0 "Agricultural Research"
COR_agriculture_research_desc:0 "One of the most important programs for economic recovery will be investments in new agricultural tools and techniques. Such research can make farming more efficient, increase food production, and make life easier for struggling farmers. We should move forward with investment in such research."
COR_southern_electrification:0 "Southern Electrification Program"
COR_southern_electrification_desc:0 "Despite much of the nation having electricity, most of the South, especially rural areas, lags behind. Russell believes that without electricity, the South will have a tough time recovering from the Great Depression. The implementation of it in areas that currently lack the technology will also have many other important benefits, such as improving communication. It's time to modernize the South."
COR_infrastructure_programs:0 "National Highway System"
COR_infrastructure_programs_desc:0 "With the advent of the automobile, President Russell believes existing roadways should be connected in a National Highway System. Such highways will make it easier to travel between the distant urban areas of the South and generally connect the nation more than ever before."
COR_university_system_of_america:0 "University System of America"
COR_university_system_of_america_desc:0 "One of Richard Russell's largest priorities has been education. In an effort to centralize higher education in the country and make it more efficient, he has proposed the creation of a "University System of America". This system will emulate the University System of Georgia and have a similar Board of Regents who sets policy for the colleges on a nationwide basis and dispense funds to them as needed."
COR_smaller_government:0 "Efficient Governance"
COR_smaller_government_desc:0 "While Russell has expanded the size of the government to deal with the economic crisis, he is still a believer in a small, efficient national government. Such a government would give the states the breathing room they were always intended to have since the days of the Founding Fathers. While Russell does not wish to cut his new programs or government salaries, he believes he has ways of cutting out corruption and mismanagement that will make government ultimately more efficient."
COR_fiscal_responsability:0 "Fiscal Responsability"
COR_fiscal_responsability_desc:0 "Part of healing the nation's economy must be ensuring that rich and poor alike are responsible with their money. We will severely limit the ability of the elite to act out the same mistakes that caused the Great Depression, and we will ensure that the aid we send to the poor is used as intended. While these measures will not be perfect, we can ensure that money flows into the economy in the ways it is meant to, and not misused."
COR_balanced_budget:0 "A Balanced Budget"
COR_balanced_budget_desc:0 "A balanced budget is an important priority of the Russell Administration, and though the task seems daunting, Russell is determined to achieve it. To balance the budget, Russell proposes tax increases on the wealthy to create a surplus and then spending some of the surplus on aid to the poor, which will even the balance. Economists have deemed it a sound plan and it will move forward within the next few days."
COR_agrarian_heritage:0 "Agrarian Heritage"
COR_agrarian_heritage_desc:0 "America has always been a rural nation, but many have forgotten this fact in the past few decades. We should take measures to take care of our farmers, providing everything from loans to subsidies to tax cuts to ensure they have what they need to keep our nation fed. The American Farmer will be stronger than ever before!"
COR_states_rights:0 "States Rights"
COR_states_rights_desc:0 "One of the loudest calls of the ODP-and now the Democratic Party-is for state's rights. The Founding Fathers promised that the federal government would not act tyrannically over the states, but that is exactly how it has acted in the past few years. Our people suffer under the weight of their government, and it is perhaps time to stop the federal government in its tracks and instead guarantee power to state governments."
COR_school_lunch_programs:0 "School Lunches For All"
COR_school_lunch_programs_desc:0 "The nation's children have been hit hard in the recent crises, and President Russell has a plan to grant them aid as well. The new "National School Lunch Act" will grant subsidies to schools to be used to provide low-cost or free lunches to all students. Giving students the option to eat lunch during the day will give them nourishment, help our farmers, and make us very popular with their parents."
COR_limit_immigration:0 "Crack Down on Immigration"
COR_limit_immigration_desc:0 "One of the greatest plights on our nation is immigration. Though we are a nation of immigrants, we should ensure newcomers come from the right places, lest we let in people who wish to destroy our way of life and replace it with their own. To guarantee this, we will enact harsher immigration laws for immigrants outside of Northern or Western Europe, so that we can better control the groups entering the country."
COR_wrestle_industrialists:0 "Outmaneuver the Industrialists"
COR_wrestle_industrialists_desc:0 "The industrialists have undermined our government at every turn, and it is time to put a stop to their treachery. Russell has enacted new laws severely limiting corporate power and the ability to form monopolies. Such a move will help to weaken the opposition, but it will also make us more popular with leftists, despite our distaste for unions. Our increased popularity will give us the ability to propagandize against uncooperative corporations, and this is just the way Russell wants it."
COR_deal_with_race_baitors:0 "Deal with Racebaiting"
COR_deal_with_race_baitors_desc:0 "It is time to decide on the implementation of a Liberia Plan with the help of Hiram Wesley Evans. Should we choose to adopt the plan, it will make us unpopular with other factions, but if we go back on our promises to Evans, it could cause a much bigger scene."
COR_nationalist_effort:0 "The Southern Bloc"
COR_nationalist_effort_desc:0 "The newly-formed Southern Bloc will be the most influential group in Congress, and it will advocate for Southern issues and beliefs in any way it can. The bloc will support measures that would benefit Southern states and vehemently oppose those that weaken or ignore them, and through this group, we will ensure the South is caught up to the rest of the nation."
COR_old_blood_and_guts:0 "Old Blood and Guts"
COR_old_blood_and_guts_desc:0 "George S. Patton has come to power in America. Known for his hard but down-to-earth approach to leadership, he now hopes to translate his experience to running the whole country. As such, he plans to put the country through a program not dissimilar to one his men would go through during training, in the hopes that this will put America on the right track. Only time will tell if  this will succeed, however."
COR_patton_speech:0 "Patton's Speech"
COR_patton_speech_desc:0 "Now that Patton has taken control, he has to solidify his position. His power over the military alone likely guarantees that he will remain in power, but the country will not be stable until he can find ways to appeal to the powerful political factions in the CAR; the Fordists, the NDWL and Klan, and even Old Democrats. Patton has decided to draft a speech to try and appeal to the American people, though his advisors beg him to make a targeted appeal to one group or another to help grow our base. The question is, which group should it be?"
COR_no_place_for_yellow_cowards:0 "Punish Cowards"
COR_no_place_for_yellow_cowards_desc:0 "We don't want yellow cowards in the army, and we sure as hell don't want them in our communities. If we want to rebuild our country, we have to get rid of these maggots and get through this on good old American guts. We will only get there if we work as a team, and I don't care if he's a soldier, a worker, or a farmer; we all have a job to do. We cleaned up the enemy, now lets clean up the country!"
COR_white_crosses:0 "White Crosses"
COR_white_crosses_desc:0 "Almost every American knows someone who died in the Civil War. Though we disagreed with our opponents, they fought as heroically as our soldiers did, and for that they should be honored. Let us have memorials for all the Americans who perished, regardless of their allegiance. It's the right thing to do-and it will endear us to thousands of grieving families, perhaps even bringing them to our side." 
COR_visit_the_soldiers:0 "Visit the Soldiers"
COR_visit_the_soldiers_desc:0 "Despite George S. Patton's position as president, he greatly dislikes the politics of his office, and prefers to be with people, specifically his soldiers. As such, he has left many of the day-to-day decision making to his vice president and cabinet, while he travels across the country giving speeches to veterans from all sides of the Civil War. For their part, the soldiers are considerably excited when they learn of Patton's arrival, and his profanity-laden inspirational speeches have inspired men nationwide."
COR_separate_but_equal:0 "Separate but Equal"
COR_separate_but_equal_desc:0 "Now that the war is over and the country is under our control, one of the biggest questions facing our politicians (and Patton) is what to do about the racial and religious questions. Specifically, all sides of the CAR are pushing for action against Blacks and Jews, though what they believe should be done about the aforementioned groups varies depending on who we talk to. In any case, Patton's views on both generally differ from extremist groups, and he adheres to more mainstream Old Democratic Party stances. What should we do?"
COR_national_discipline:0 "National Discipline"
COR_national_discipline_desc:0 "George S. Patton emphasizes discipline over all else in his men, but now he wishes to extend that to all Americans. Alcoholism, rape, adultery, and other offenses violate American culture and lead to decline. We should discourage these things, especially while we continue to rebuild the country, while also continuing to push Patton's programs of reconstruction, which are hard on workers but are becoming more normal every day." 
COR_new_tank_forces:0 "New Tank Forces"
COR_new_tank_forces_desc:0 "With the experience of the Civil War, it is clear that tanks are essential to modern warfare. We should build tank schools, train new tank crews, and build as many tanks as possible. The country with the largest tank force will have the world in its hand, Patton argues, and we should be first in that metric.Otherwise, we would risk falling behind and Patton will not allow that."
COR_kick_insurgents:0 "Kick Insurgents"
COR_kick_insurgents_desc:0 "Even though the Civil War is over, there are still resistance groups attempting to destabilize our fragile government. Other leaders might be worried by such developments, but Patton has been in high spirits, desperate to be in the field again. Though this sort of warfare is not as clear-cut as two armies clashing, Patton is insisting we move quickly so we can "kick them in the balls and go home". For his men, that is all they need to hear."
COR_the_slap_heard_nationwide:0 "The Slap Heard Nationwide"
COR_the_slap_heard_nationwide_desc:0 "Patton is known for his potential for anger, though this is perhaps an unfair characterization. Regardless, today, that exact scenario has occurred, and Patton has slapped someone! Other prominent ideological factions in government are deciding how to best respond with their own interests in mind. Though our citizens have mixed views on the event, we must act quickly to prevent new conflicts..."
COR_american_values:0 "American Values"
COR_american_values_desc:0 "George S. Patton was born in the West, and believes that the popularity of the Wild West in our culture is something to take notice of or even encourage. However, he also stresses the traditional American Protestant work ethic, noting that such ideas have been important since the nation's founding. Together, these two ideas will form the nucleus of a new, but still traditional, American culture that emphasizes courage, determination, and hard work."
COR_lessons_of_history:0 "Lessons of History"
COR_lessons_of_history_desc:0 "Patton, a student of history, scoffs at MacArthur's Caesar name, and has decided to come up with names of his own to poke fun at the man. He has variously called himself the American Hannibal, the American Scipio, the American Napoleon, and even the American Asskicker, in a speech to his men. Nicknames aside, Patton says he aims to learn the lessons from those times that still apply today, and implement them in a way that brings America's military closer to victory."
COR_restore_the_initiative:0 "Restore the Initiative"
COR_restore_the_initiative_desc:0 "Despite his distaste for politics, Patton has grown uneasy in recent weeks. In the wake of mounting reports of tensions between the ODP and its rival groups, it is clear that action will need to be taken if more bloodshed is to be avoided. Patton's worldview is typically unsuited to politics, but his desire for quick action may just save the nation from collapse..."
COR_reorganize_politics:0 "Reorganize Political Parties"
COR_reorganize_politics_desc:0 "Not a man to care much about parties or political identities, Patton has agreed to proposals his advisors have put forward to reorganize the old Republican and Democratic parties. To do so, his advisors will recruit prominent Democrats and either have them serve as heads of the new Democratic Party or switch over to the Republican Party and rebuild it from scratch. Whatever they do, Patton warns, he will not cowards in his government."
COR_unbroken_spirit:0 "Unbroken Spirit"
COR_unbroken_spirit_desc:0 "Patton's America has emerged from the chaos of the 1930's bruised and wounded, but with an unbroken spirit. The president's tough programs for rebuilding the country are beginning to pay off, as Americans adjust to Patton's demanding leadership style and adapt remarkably well, and it won't be long before the country has fully recovered. Patton, for his part, looks to the horizon and wonders where God will take him next."
COR_jewish_segregation:0 "Jewish Segregation"
COR_jewish_segregation_desc:0 "The NDWL's position has always been that Jews have long had too much influence in our, with many being supports of socialism.

COR_democrats_education:0 "Old Democrat Schooling"
COR_democrats_education_desc:0 "The children of America need access to a proper education lead by the Old Democrats. We will expand rural schools alongside an emphasis on American values, patriotism, the ODP's defense of America from integration and socialism and the various evils of big business, Longism and Marxism. All teachers will be expected to register with the ODP if they desire advancement."
COR_work_with_natives:0 "Native Alliances"
COR_work_with_natives_desc:0 "Many Native American tribes are as tired of the federal government's policies towards them as we are, with many even being penalized for siding with the Confederacy in the First American Civil War.

COR_the_american_legion:0 "The American Legion"
COR_the_american_legion_desc:0 "The end of the Republic would have ended in disaster if not for the brave veterans of the American Legion. It was the American Legion under Moseley that stood tall when public hysteria grew against syndicalists. It was also the American Legion that stood firm with Lindbergh and Ford when they fairly won the leadership of the Old Democrats."
COR_the_order_of_76:0 "The Order of 76"
COR_the_order_of_76_desc:0 "Nothing secures our position more than loyal patriots and our paramilitary allies in the Order of 76 are just that. Espousing pro-nationalist views a combatting not only syndicalists but those sillier Old Democrats whom admire a purer agrarianism over the Fordist program we will need to provide them funding and encourage defections from various White Leagues into it."
COR_use_the_fbi:0 "Use the Pinkertons"
COR_use_the_fbi_desc:0 "Patriotic corporations still need our aid from saboteurs and it would be foolish to not use one of the most skilled detective agencies in the United States; the Pinkertons. After contracting their services any company that is an ally of the state will be loaned Pinkertons when threatened by radicalism and their detectives will work to investigate enemies of our Republic."
COR_alien_and_sedition_act:0 "New Alien and Sedition Acts"
COR_alien_and_sedition_act_desc:0 "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
COR_national_corporatism:0 "Protestant Corporatism"
COR_national_corporatism_desc:0 "Every productive group within this nation is a great cog contributing to the machine that is the American Economy. It is time to formalize them with a preference for White Protestants, organizing workers and managers by their profession and giving each of them representation in government so that they may have a voice with the central government."
COR_cointelpro:0 "COINTELPRO"
COR_cointelpro_desc:0 "The success of the New Aliens and Sedition Act has allowed us to identify several non-political and religious organizations with known syndicalist members.

COR_purge_dissidents:0 "Purge Dissidents"
COR_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee.

COR_office_of_policy_coordination:0 "Office of Policy Coordination"
COR_office_of_policy_coordination_desc:0 "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favor through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and direct sabotage. The OPC will enable us to softly muscle out radicals and indignant federalists that wish to re-enter the US government on their terms."
COR_the_black_chamber:0 "The Black Chamber"
COR_the_black_chamber_desc:0 "Another safety objective is to revitalize the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
COR_nationalist_restoration:0 "Nationalist Restoration"
COR_nationalist_restoration_desc:0 "Americans have not felt patriotic towards their old nation in a long time. This will change with the advent of our new nation. No longer will Americans be ashamed of the country they were born in.

COR_embrace_wild_west:0 "Embrace the Wild West"
COR_embrace_wild_west_desc:0 "The South shares a lot of characteristics with the stereotypical 'Wild West'. We should seek to take these similarities from the Hollywood world and extend them to our world. Certain parts of our message have appeal out West, sometimes even more so than they do in the South. More importantly, a gradual advance West will help us eliminate remaining Longist dissidents who block our way to the Pacific."
COR_odp_spreads:0 "The ODP Grows"
COR_odp_spreads_desc:0 "If we want to control the country, the Old Democratic Party will need to expand its base outside of the South. One area that is ripe for expansion is the old Federalist territory. Our kin in Virginia will be quick to embrace the ODP, and now that we control Washington, we can grow there as well, destroying Federalist rebels once and for all."
COR_traitorous_reds:0 "Traitorous Reds"
COR_traitorous_reds_desc:0 "Before the War, Murray warned about the traitorous Reds that he believed would try to ruin the nation and all we held dear. When the Red Belt revolted, they only proved his point. Now that we have won, we should send these ideas back across the sea where they came from. As for the people, well, we have something for them too..."
COR_fight_miscegenation:0 "Fight Miscegenation"
COR_fight_miscegenation_desc:0 "We observed firsthand what happens to a politically-divided nation during the Civil War. That was a tragedy we do not wish to repeat. By ensuring separation on racial lines instead, we will ensure the country is united, and keep our heritage while we are at it."
COR_small_businesses:0 "Small Town America"
COR_small_businesses_desc:0 "When Bill Murray railed against corporations, he was not talking about business or enterprise. He was concerned with banks and business tycoons who come from cosmopolitan backgrounds and try to ruin the small businesses and towns of America. We will side with the small businessman and make sure that these corporations cannot ruin our way of life."
COR_american_nationalism:0 "American Nationalism"
COR_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances.

COR_nationalize_boy_scouts:0 "Control the Boy Scouts"
COR_nationalize_boy_scouts_desc:0 "Patriotic youth organizations have existed in Europe for decades.

COR_fordism:0 "Fordism"
COR_fordism_desc:0 "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management.

COR_american_capitalism1:0 "American Capitalism"
COR_american_capitalism1_desc:0 "Our country is a capitalist nation, and through the War Powers Committee we can revitalize the age of progress that dissidents and populists intended to destroy. Through our loyal Congressmen, Business Councils will be formed again in the Capitol, taxes will be lowered, and the stock market will be made safe from terrorism."
COR_capitalist_education:0 "Create the ESMWT"
COR_capitalist_education_desc:0 "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralize technological changes. Instead of cooperation that would disrupt competition and give an unfair advantage to certain businesses, this program disburses its findings freely to the public."
COR_captains_of_industry:0 "Captains of Industry"
COR_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost. We should push through Congress a new income tax bracket for those earning more than $10 million dollars annually. With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."
COR_industrial_security_act:0 "Industrial Security Act"
COR_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "The need for work-site security has never been greater. The average working man is besieged by syndicalist infiltrators, Longist provocateurs, and federalist malcontents. We need to authorize the use of strikebreakers and integrate our loyal American Legionaries into the new National Guard so as to quickly respond to industrial sabotage."
COR_pass_nira:0 "National Labor Control Act"
COR_pass_nira_desc:0 "A permanent solution to the labor crisis has presented itself in the form of then executive order by Lindbergh to set up a national labor control bureau. The NLRB will remedy unfair labor practices by both unions and business owners. The impartial wording of the agency has received widespread support from third parties."
COR_red_scare:0 "Red Scare"
COR_red_scare_desc:0 "Enough of the former liberal cosmopolitan strategy of attempting to negotiate with or appease red radicals, favoring them over the American people. We shall complete what Wilson may had been able to do had they not been weakened by internal traitors with an increased effort to arrest their collaborators and the illegalization of all socialist-aligned organizations."
COR_disband_klan:0 "Disband the Klan"
COR_disband_klan_desc:0 "While we believe the Klan stands for agreeable values its vigilante nature and autonomy can make it a problem, especially when some reject Lindbergh and Ford for being 'yankees'. We will formally dissolve the local Klan chapters and offer their members new jobs in the police and military if they desire it, and promise them both a refund for Klan membership and a new society group with better rewards."
COR_citizen_monitors:0 "Citizen Monitors"
COR_citizen_monitors_desc:0 "Many former Klan members are still disgruntled at our decision to disband the KKK despite attempts to appease the members. Forming the Citizen Monitors of the Republic will rectify this, a watchdog society that focuses on reporting immorality and subversion. We will offer direct aid to the Citizen Monitors via helping them coordinate with police departments and internal social benefits."
COR_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
COR_traditional_values_desc:0 "An address by President [COR.GetLeader] has denounced the changes of the last thirty years as the agenda of foreigners that sought to destroy America's industrious nature.

COR_republic_without_democracy:0 "Republic without Democracy"
COR_republic_without_democracy_desc:0 "The American Republic was meant to be a great nation but was subverted by an expansion of democracy to uninterested and unpatriotic forces.

COR_chemical_economy_desc:0 "Long of interest to Ford and agrarians looking for more uses for agricultural goods, the chemurgy movement of William Hale believes in using agricultural goods to create consumer and chemical products rather than relying on non-replenishable fuels.

COR_organize_militants:0 "Absorb the White Caps"
COR_organize_militants_desc:0 "Currently the government and NDWL has a very organization with regards to the various white leagues, especially for those used for subterfuge against enemies of the state.

COR_klan_oath:0 "Klan Oath"
COR_klan_oath_desc:0 "It is high time for the Klan to get the respect it deserves despite some resistance remaining even in the CAR.

COR_protecting_our_race:0 "Revive Nativism"
COR_protecting_our_race_desc:0 "The foundations of America as the White Leaguers understand is not only our connection to the former nation of Britain but to the blood within Anglo-Saxons as a race.

COR_camps_for_syndies:0 "Criminalise Syndicalism"
COR_camps_for_syndies_desc:0 "The future of Syndicalism and Longism has been decided.

The American Legion has already begun to clear meeting houses and city councils of traitors."
COR_forced_labor:0 "Forced Labor"
COR_forced_labor_desc:0 "The loss of one hundred thousand people from the labor market has angered what used to be loyal Legionaries. Debates in the once quiet halls of Congress are erupting to demand Simmons find a solution to the lack of able-bodied workers in America. Simmons's solution? Forced labor for traitors at the service of the corporation that is the Commonwealth."

COR_black_laws:0 "Black Laws"
COR_black_laws_desc:0 "The Jim Crow laws are a good start but fail to go far enough to stop black America from overthrowing the White Man from his rightful place in history.

COR_christian_work_ethic_desc:0 "With the advent of our knew nation, there begins a split in work ethic across the nation that the Old Democrat radicals did not intend.

COR_defending_the_white_race:0 "Defending the White Race"
COR_defending_the_white_race_desc:0 "With all the recent laws we have passed, we should prepare for a backlash. It would not do to have our women and children attacked by savages.

COR_deal_with_catholics_desc:0 "The Unitarians and Catholics still hold many views unbecoming of a patriot but they may keep the churches so long as they do not donate to or endorse liberal causes and allow Klansmen into their pews, alongside obeying existing conformations.

COR_destroy_the_legion:0 "Destroy the Legion"
COR_destroy_the_legion_desc:0 "While many admire the Black Legion and its closest allies for going to the extreme to defend Whiteness they have simply become uncontrollable alongside having already attempted to subjugate the Young Klan.

COR_citzens_council:0 "White Citizens Councils"
COR_citzens_council_desc:0 "The legacy of civil disobedience that shook the 1930s has stayed with the members of the White Citizens Council.

We should provide them with further tax exemptions."
COR_true_corporatism:0 "True Corporatism"
COR_true_corporatism_desc:0 "We must set the economy on a path that is both functional and patriotic.

COR_klan_education:0 "Klan Education"
COR_klan_education_desc:0 "Our children must learn true American values as well as about historical criminals whom attempted to undue our nation such as MacArthur, Grant and Lincoln.

COR_family_programs:0 "Family Programs"
COR_family_programs_desc:0 "The failure of the Old Klan was to consider the KKK merely a militia society when it is a societal for the white race. However, that can only be true if the Klan sees a massive expansion in membership among native American Protestants.

COR_Klan_Marshals:0 "Marshals of the Red Shirt"
COR_Klan_Marshals_desc:0 "The Klan has seen expansion but nonetheless suffers each chapter having a bit too much autonomy. This breeds leadership crises' and the habits of the Klan changing by region making it look arbitrary at times, being either too soft or harsh in such a way as to lose public support.

COR_birth_of_a_nation_desc:0 "The dream of Thomas Dixon Jr. has been completed. The Ku Klux Klan reigns supreme and no minority, liberal or socialist in their right mind would dare oppose it. With the introduction of an amended constitution The White Leagues will never again operate in the dark, our celebrations should be national and the KKK recognized as the Fraternity of America with its opponents suspect of treachery."
COR_cooperation_from_afar:0 "Cooperation from Afar"
COR_cooperation_from_afar_desc:0 "With the American Black population increasingly residing in Liberia we could follow the suggestions of some nationalists on both sides of the aisle and improve relations with the state for both their resources and a shared front against syndicalism and integration. In return they would undoubtedly want something from us but a nominal ally would be useful as we are short on them."
COR_american_exodus:0 "American Exodus"
COR_american_exodus_desc:0 "Minorities are fleeing the United States with our Presidents announcement proclaiming the Fraternity of America. Most of our members are quite happy with this although some believe they are leaving too slowly.

COR_klan_cinema_desc:0 "While in the 1920's Hollywood promoted much filth that has since been banned, it also created some of our greatest pictures such as D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation.

COR_united_against_syndicalism_desc:0 "A new campaign against syndicalism and reminder of the dangers it poses and the domestic enemies to the state they are associated with will spur unity and recruitment among the population, as well as loyalty among the some of those who are still skeptical of the NDWL."
COR_alma_white:0 "Church of the Fiery Cross"
COR_alma_white_desc:0 "White Protestantism not only advances the interest of the white man but of the white women as well.

COR_the_protocals_of_zion:0 "The Protocols of Zion"
COR_the_protocals_of_zion_desc:0 "With our variant of protestant Christianity seeing a further expansion among female white supremacists it is time to stomp out the next-greatest threat to our political power, the Christian Identitarians. Their influence in the White League is troubling as is their loyalty to non-Klan figures. We shall use their tales of being the 'true Jews' to great effect by spreading the Protocols of Zion with an updated preface describing the Elders of Zion desire to align themselves with those values. A stretch yes, but one that may save us and America."
COR_fund_racial_sciences:0 "Fund Racial Sciences"
COR_fund_racial_sciences_desc:0 "If Klan views are to seem legitimate it needs not only political backing, but scientific backing as well.

COR_the_black_legion:0 "The Black Legion"
COR_the_black_legion_desc:0 "Undoubtedly our most valuable and powerful allies, the Black Legion has the will to do what even other Old Democrats won't.

COR_Klan_capitalism_desc:0 "While capitalism can be useful for the advancement of the white race the proper donations must be made.

COR_riches_of_africa_desc:0 "Our Order is expanding but we must rake in more resources. We can do just that while establishing our global dominance by rescinding the American mistake of not grabbing the chunks of Africa that has enriched so much of Europe.

COR_christian_education_desc:0 "Apart from its unfortunate unitariaism, Harvard's Divinity School should have been the gold standard for education since its inception. The education of true Christians is essential to our national health and to do that we should found divinity schools across the nation including the newly titled "Ambassador Colleges" to be run according to Armstrongite standards and doctrine.

COR_church_and_state:0 "The Holy Church of Zion"
COR_church_and_state_desc:0 "The Church of Zion has seen expansion but not enough to secure our rule.

COR_american_estates:0 "American Estates"
COR_american_estates_desc:0 "It is not true that God does not approve of the wealthy as prosperity is a reward for a devout life.

COR_the_klan_proselytizing_desc:0 "There are those within the Klan whom do not conform to Christian Identity and are still uncomfortable with the Church of Zion leading the charge for the white race.

### Rush Limbaugh Chads"

COR_new_forty_eighters:0 "Resurgence of the Forty-Eighters"
COR_new_forty_eighters_desc:0 "First established in 1919 in the hope of creating a new political party for social reform and Liberal progressivism in defiance of the increasingly conservative Republican and Democratic parties, the Committee of 48, more commonly called the Forty-Eighters, are perhaps the only group of true egalitarian and raceblind Liberal forces in the Constitutional Republic. They are largely made up of the few former Social Dixiecrats and Crumpites that began to truly fight for race equality and Liberalism working alongside and granting legitimacy to a collection of Liberals and anti-Socialist Progressives from across the re-unified nation and particularly from their old center of influence in New York. Viciously anti-Revolutionary and anti-Syndicalist, these Pink Liberals instead focus on pushing their progressing and reformist attitudes within a fair and free democracy under the guidance of the Forty-Eighters and their leaders Rush Limbaugh Sr, J.A.H. Hopkins, and Dudley Field Malone. By their hand, a true and egalitarian interpretation of the Constitution shall be pursued in this Second American Republic, for it is as the Founding Fathers will it."
COR_progressive_reconciliation:0 "Tame the Bull Moose"
COR_progressive_reconciliation_desc:0 "The new Bull Moose Progressive Party of George Norris and Quentin Roosevelt might have failed in their push for winning over America with the Progressive Liberal ideals of Teddy Roosevelt, but that was certainly not tied to the validity of their ideas. We too are students of the Square Deal, and we too preach peace and American unity. We shall move to pardon and ally the Progressives, taming the Bull Moose and shackling it to our side as our sturdy, proven, and popular steed to ride as we guide America to the new pink dawn."
COR_improve_healthcare:0 "Improve the National Healthcare System"
COR_improve_healthcare_desc:0 "A national healthcare system has never been needed more in American history, for the Second American Civil War has left more sick, wounded, and disabled Americans in its wake than we have ever seen before. Unemployed and unable to work, they cannot get the care they need, and the rest of the country cannot afford it with the economy in shambles. We must move to provide free and universal healthcare to all Americans regardless of race, gender, or age, for that is the way to truly heal America."
COR_reject_foreign_autocracy:0 "Reject Foreign Autocracy"
COR_reject_foreign_autocracy_desc:0 "All across the world, foreign plagues such as authoritarianism, totalitarianism, autocratic militarism, and revolutionary and reactionary ideas all attempt to penetrate America’s defenses, hailing from the Internationale, the Reichspakt, and beyond. They probe the hearts and minds of the masses for weaknesses and try to worm themselves into the thoughts of the innocent, stealing away the loyalty of our people. If we are to protect the nation from these foreign vermin, we must defend the nation and steel the minds and psyches of the people, for America shall not fall to these termites without a fight."
COR_universal_disarmament:0 "Pursue Universal Disarmament"
COR_universal_disarmament_desc:0 "Every effort should be made to secure universal disarmament, or world peace and anti-militarism, by international agreement, and America should be the leader in this goal. We freshly know the cost of war, and the grave violence, death, and loss it brings with it. We must guide the world to accept these realities so that we all do not share the same grave fate. We shall show the world our peaceful ways, by force it we have to."
COR_establish_progressive_capitalism:0 "Establish Progressive Capitalist Economics"
COR_establish_progressive_capitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism does not have to be a predatory system, for when it is created fairly and supervised, it truly can give every single person a fair and equal shot at the American Dream. We shall proliferate and build progressive Capitalist economics, finances, and monetary practices all across America, ensuring that no one gets caught and ground up in the gears of progress on our way to true Americanism."
COR_sideline_revolutionaries_and_reactionaries:0 "No Revolution, No Reaction"
COR_sideline_revolutionaries_and_reactionaries_desc:0 "The only two acceptable revolutions in American history were the American Revolution that freed us from the British, and the Second American Civil War that - despite its horrific destruction - allowed our movement to take control of America’s destiny. All other forms of Revolution are vile and dangerous plagues. Reactionary thought, Revolutionary behavior’s foul twin, is just as putrid, and both these traitorous ideas must not be allowed to take hold within America ever again. We shall safeguard American Progressivism and Liberalism no matter what and with everything at our disposal, for freedom shall not be trampled on ever again."
COR_equal_economic_political_legal_rights:0 "Equal Economics, Politics, and Judiciary"
COR_equal_economic_political_legal_rights_desc:0 "If we are to further these progressive ideas, we must do so at every level of society.

COR_cooperate_with_labor_and_agriculture:0 "Cooperate with Organized Workers and Farmers"
COR_cooperate_with_labor_and_agriculture_desc:0 "Workers and working farmers are the foundation of any nation, and America is no different. This idea can be controversial to some, who claim it as Socialism, but Agrarian and Humanitarian societies have been pursuing these policies for centuries without Socialism ever entering their minds. We must work with this vital foundation, supporting these ups and downs and aiding them in their work with subsidies and emergency funds, non-Socialist unionism, mechanization, and more in order to truly build a strong and fair economy that runs at peak efficiency."
COR_protect_free_speech:0 "Enforce the Bill of Rights"
COR_protect_free_speech_desc:0 "The Bill of Rights is the most important section of the hallowed Constitution, protecting the basic human rights and privileges of an American citizen. In its own language, the Bill of Rights extends to all American citizens, but the policy of previous administrations did not respect that clear language, crushing the free speech and basic right to life of many of those it deemed unworthy. We shall rectify this issue, and ensure that all Americans, no matter their race or gender, have a fair spot in this nation fully protected by our founding documents and the egalitarian ideas of the Founding Fathers."

COR_silence_klanationalists_normal_desc:0 "The Ku Klux Klan is a vile organization. Though they might have helped in our fight during the Civil War, they only did so to further their own racist, anti-semitic, anti-Catholic, and otherwise bigoted agenda. We cannot abide by such vile, caustic, dangerous, and entirely un-American ideas and actions, so the Klan must be stopped at all costs. Their leaders are to be executed, their lackeys and loyalists are to be jailed or exiled, lest they resist and meet the same fate as their former Grand Dragons, and Progressive Civil Rights is to be pursued under guard of the state. Death to the Klan!"
COR_human_klan:0 "Humanize the Klan"
COR_human_klan_desc:0 "Always a Klan ally and devout Protestant, President Graves has moved to work with the Klan in order to further our agenda. By humanizing the Klan and keeping them from Black communities, they shall serve as an arm of the state that aids our White communities while the state handles our African-American citizens. By cooperating in harmony and respecting the views of all Americans, we can create a liberal haven that does not infringe on the rights, ideas, thoughts, beliefs, or speech of any Americans so long as they remain peaceful to each other."
COR_believers_in_american_progress:0 "The Believers in American Progress"
COR_believers_in_american_progress_desc:0 "We are the true believers of American progress and Liberalism. The true heirs of the Bull Moose party and of the Founding Fathers. The true scions and rigid interpreters of the hallowed Constitution, and the saviors of Americanist Democracy and anti-Leftist Progressivism. By our hand, the American Dream has evolved and been purified, now achievable by all within our beautiful republic. Liberty and justice for all is now no longer just a saying, but a reality, and the Forty-Eighters shall keep it that way!"

COR_crumps_machine:0 "'Boss' Crump Takes a Gamble"
COR_crumps_machine_desc:0 "Taking a gamble and risking it all, Boss Edward Hull Crump has passed the weak-willed Russell administration in order to bring true Southern prosperity to this new America. A fan of New Deal-esque policies and open to utilizing the South’s massive Black population in order to ensure his dominance for years to come, Boss Crump leads his Memphis-based Democrat political machine with a corruption-laiden velvet fist, rising from being the dominant figure of Memphis, Tennessee to the most powerful man in Dixie. On his political slot machine, he always hits the jackpot, so let us all rejoice as Boss Crump and his Memphis Machine drive the state towards his own populist ambitions."
COR_corrupt_machine:0 "Corrupted ‘Democratic’ Machine"
COR_corrupt_machine_desc:0 "The Democrats and Old Democrats of our new America already understand the dangers of true Democracy, but we shall show them another way. Instead of out-right killing elective democracy, we will instead shackle it entirely to our needs. Corruption and graft will rule over direct and open authoritarianism. We will bend the very fabric of America’s sacred democratic institutions to our very will and ambitions."
COR_controlled_politics:0 "Compromised ‘Republican’ Politics"
COR_controlled_politics_desc:0 "Representative Republican politics has its uses, but it also has far more issues as well - issues that must be corrected in order to suit the needs of Boss Crump. We must work to fully bend each and every representative, career politician, bureaucrat, general and civil servant in the nation to our will, greasing the wheels forward to this goal with endless bribery, graft, corruption, and more! "
COR_black_voting:0 "Sway the ‘Swing’ Voters"
COR_black_voting_desc:0 "Looking past the shortsighted racism of his counterparts, Boss Crump shall implement the ingenious voter strategy that once ensured his place as the king of Memphis. By giving the power and freedom to vote back to the Black population of this new America, and by being the only major political force friendly to their needs and open to solving their issues, we shall secure our electoral success for decades to come as these African-Americans pay back their debt to Crump in votes year after year. Round up these new voters and throw them in the voter wagons; there’s polls to get to!"
COR_ouster_laws:0 "A New Ouster Law"
COR_ouster_laws_desc:0 "The Ouster Law was a series of bills passed by political opponents of Boss Crump and his Social Machine during his time in Memphis, giving these political opponents the legal authority to fire any government employee violating or refusing to enforce state laws. These bills were aimed at Crump and his cronies due to their lax enforcement of Tennessee’s strict prohibition and tax laws, and though Crump has long been free of these restrictions, his old foes have given him an idea. Passing a new Ouster Law, Crump shall give himself the full legal authority to fire any of his rivals, opponents, and detractors, further consolidating this new America in the hands of the Boss."
COR_blind_eye_to_booze:0 "Turn a Blind Eye to Alcohol"
COR_blind_eye_to_booze_desc:0 "Continuing his long held tradition established during his time as Mayor of Memphis, Boss Crump shall turn a blind eye to the profitable if ‘sinful’ alcohol industry in America. The lifeblood of the working masses and one of our largest economic sectors, to shut down total alcohol production in the name of some moral idea of Prohibition would only strangle our infantile economy further. Besides, even Boss Crump enjoys a good, stiff drink now and again, so why shouldn’t the common man too!"
COR_southern_new_deal:0 "New Deal for the New South"
COR_southern_new_deal_desc:0 "A fan of the populist policies espoused by figures like the late FDR and his political allies in NYC such as La Guardia, Boss Crump seeks to build his own form of this New Deal for our New South. Relief, reform, and recovery shall become the name of the game, ushered in by loyal Machine lieutenants, as we work to build a populist, pro-worker economy here in our beloved Dixie; one free from the caustic Socialism and Liberalism espoused by our Northern kin and one that only provides for those accepted by our Social Machine."
COR_cotton_row:0 "Reseed Cotton Row"
COR_cotton_row_desc:0 "Long holding ties to the cotton industry since his time as a youth working at the Walter Goodman Cotton Company, Boss Crump has built a network of allies from the business elite of this new America. This ‘Cotton Row’ is a group of rich Capitalists that dominate the cotton industry and its attached businesses, while also having a small but influential ‘Modernizers’ wing that push for basic reforms to education, healthcare, and city-planning across America. Embracing both sides of Cotton Row, Boss Crump shall further seed their powerbase all across the nation, implementing the Modernizers’ reforms while further delivering the national economy to these elite friends on a silver platter."
COR_merge_inefficent_departments:0 "Consolidate Inefficient Departments"
COR_merge_inefficent_departments_desc:0 "Believing that separate operations for each municipal utility were inherently inefficient, Crump once combined all the utilities of Memphis into Memphis Light, Gas and Water which rose to become one of the most efficient and cost-effective municipal utilities in the old Union. Following these ideas, utilities all across the nation shall be consolidated into unified bodies, each responsible for a sector of the new nation that each answers directly to Crump. With this new system, efficient city planning, metropolitan maintenance, and the livelihood of our rural populations shall all be improved."
COR_influence_state_politics:0 "An Invisible Grip on State Politics"
COR_influence_state_politics_desc:0 "Though individual States shall maintain the rights and freedoms each as fought so hard to preserve, Boss Crump shall maintain an invisible grip over all state-level politics in order to guide each constituent member of our Union into a more agreeable direction. An invisible hand shall lurk over this new America, but not once concerned with market freedoms or the economy; this hand, greased by corruption, shall merely push the States and this wider Union into Crump’s ingenious and desired direction."
COR_use_former_reps:0 "Lend a Hand to Republican Runaways"
COR_use_former_reps_desc:0 "The Republican Party practically shattered in the build up and fallout of this new Civil War, with their former members fleeing across the nation and finding solace in new political movements. We should extend a hand, or a bribe, to these former Republicans, like Boss Crump once did to secure his power base in Tennessee. With these new Democrats on our side, the Social Machine shall further extend to new heights of political dominance."
COR_increase_poll_tax:0 "Bending Poll Taxes to Our Will"
COR_increase_poll_tax_desc:0 "Poll taxes are an easy way to bring in extra income for the state, and help limit how many can actually vote. However, they have traditionally been used to limit the ability to vote of the lower, and frequently Black, class. Continuing what the Social Machine did in Memphis, Crump shall personally pay the poll tax for any and all Black voters, so long as they vote for him of course."
COR_a_solid_machine:0 "A Working Man's Machine"
COR_a_solid_machine_desc:0 "Doing what few thought was even possible, Boss Crump has created a successful populist platform in this new America built upon corruption, selective workers’ rights, and racial ‘equality’ - at least in terms of voting power. Greasing the wheels and road ahead with the slick oil of graft, a ‘true’ Working Man’s Machine has been created - one that supports the masses that support Crump back. With the nation in the palm of Boss Crump’s hand, and with the nation’s democratic processes fully bent to his ambitions, a new age rises for America, and Boss Crump shall be its uncompromising, unflappable, and bespectacled herald!"

COR_research_projects_desc:0 "In the wake of the collapse of the CSA, the National Education Association has folded and its members dispersed.

COR_business_subsides_desc:0 "The dual-layered federal government system had allowed for at times very loose regulations on workspace practice, depending on the state. In order to leverage this inherent balance in our government, we must allow businesses both large and small to thrive."
COR_building_grants:0 "Building Grants"
COR_building_grants_desc:0 "Smaller townships across America have no recourse if their need is slightly less than the threshold for contract work.

COR_new_weapons:0 "New Weapon Designs"

COR_le_may_reform:0 "Lindbergh Reform Plan"
COR_le_may_reform_desc:0 "Charles Lindbergh's fame follows him even here, and the aviator has proposed a bold plan of reform.

COR_combined_arms_offensive_desc:0 "While our air officers stand at the ready, an issue has arisen once more that impedes the progress of our force: Army officers don't exactly know how to exploit our air power to its fullest potential.

This last title holder, Smedley Butler, had foolishly sided with the syndicalists. Whomever taken this position will symbolically represent the veterans of the United States military in society, and thus our choice is important. A common name floated up is General George Moseley, though his alliance with national corporatists makes him somewhat controversial among others. Of course a more popular choice is George Patton himself despite not being terribly diplomatic. Some NDWL members dispute both of these choices and claim their man Wickliffe Draper has earned the position. Who shall be appointed?"

Exiled from Detroit he has been using his foreign and local factories to supply us with needed goods but he now offers us far more. He would like us to allow him control of major control of our industries so that he may organize and upgrade them along Fordist lines. Obviously this would make him one of the most powerful men in our Republic but it may be needed for the war effort. Fordist supporters such as George Von Moseley, Charles Lindbergh and Vance Muse are supportive of the effort although the White Leagues are less-so, believing him to not be loyal to the Klan cause and too elitist to serve the cause."

This includes agreeable literature such the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and pamphlets on clean living but also encouraging workers and managers to join the Order of 76 or if a veteran the American Legion. It doesn't help that the original wing of the Order of the 76 suffered a schism and in protest of Clare Hoffman's growing influence its leader Royal S. Gulden joined the Silver Shirts, a movement that now aligns itself with Huey Long! Their growth comes at the expense of the National Democratic While League, especially as the Order of 76 forbids membership into Christian Identity groups run by the Elders of Zion and discourages dual Klan membership.

As such Charles Lindbergh and Clare Hoffman (representing the Order), have decided to visit Alfalfa Bill and over dinner discuss making several concessions that would allow Lindbergh to become the new head of state. Alfalfa Bill is well aware of how the game is played but he remains aware they still need his backing to come to power so while Murray had expected something along these lines occurring he was nonetheless entertained at his guests obvious desperation to have him accept. Well aware he could set up a deal for himself while gaining needed industrial support for the cause, Murray wondered if they would be willing to subsidize small farmers, to appoint him lifelong governor of Oklahoma and have him appointed to a symbolic rank that was technically above them. With them agreeing Murray now had a choice between accepting or turning them down regardless, well aware them being upset would damage the war effort but also being ambivalent about carpetbagger industrialists running the nation, albeit ones with agreeable ideas and whom paid respect to agrarianism."

Initially Lindbergh evokes mixed feelings from some of the populace due to his own heritage as northern 'Elitist' but others feel he is a better unifying figure for America than Murray would be and more importantly can rally more the nation. As a result Northern Old Democrats are more encouraged than Southern loyalists by his appointment... at least until the party papers can work their magic. In the meantime the NDWL has mixed-to-negative feelings on the issue, dampening their support of the war effort."

constate.600.d:0 "For years, Alfalfa Bill Murray has led the country through some of its most trying times, but now rumors abound of his deteriorating physical state. While Murray could easily live for many more years, the stress of holding the country together has clearly had an impact on the man. Some are beginning to openly wonder about a successor to Murray, though all suggested candidates are members of the ODP elite in one way or another. The hardliners in the party wish to see Eugene Talmadge, the Georgia firebrand, at the head of the ODP. His allegiance to Murray and the ODP is without question, but some question whether he can handle the economy or foreign policy given his overt focus on racial policies. The more liberally-minded candidate, Strom Thurmond, is a masterful politician, but far younger and less experienced than Talmadge. If he were to succeed Murray, the hardliners in the party as well as those outside the party might protest that Thurmond does not adequately live up to the ideals of the state Murray founded only a few short years ago. Hidden among these two giants is Murray's lieutenant, John E. Rankin. Rankin, a quiet elderly statesman with years of experience, would be the safe choice, but many have openly wondered whether Rankin has the strength of personality to hold the fractured nation together. Regardless of these choices, the choice of retirement is ultimately up to Murray, and if he wishes to stay in power, there are few that would oppose him..."

While his status as a Democrat is alarming to some, he is extremely similar to Murray in policy terms, and has promised to continue Murray's vision for America. This is a promise that has garnered him significant support from the ODP, especially from their Georgia members. His ascension to power does not come without challenge however; his largest detractor appears to be Eugene Talmadge, one of the most powerful Old Democrats and a personal rival to Russell. For Russell to keep power for any meaningful amount of time, he will need to act quickly to ease the concerns of the ODP. He will be able to fend off the Fordists or the NDWL if he has the support of most of the ODP, but outmaneuvering Talmadge will take everything Russell has. However, Russell has always been a better politician than Talmadge, and Talmadge has made many enemies with his fiery personality. Meanwhile, Russell has good relationships with many of these same politicians, and he could call in some favors. It will not be an easy task however..."

constate.602.t:0 "A Done Deal?"
constate.602.d:0 "By putting Richard Russell in charge, William Murray has undoubtedly shown his intentions for an alliance with the Western faction, even though he was forced out of power for advocating it. Richard Russell, ever the clever political actor, has refrained from using language about a direct alliance. Instead, he has advocated a mere neutrality pact between the two, with a solution to be determined at the end of the war. Since the Pacific States are run by Democrats that agree with Russell on many issues, it is difficult to accuse Russell of betraying his principles by allying with them. For now, the controversy around this deal has waned, but it will be replaced by other issues. Should we pass this deal?"

Of course, as we are still in a state of war neither side can escalate the conflict further without risking their own security. However many are calling this unacceptable and would us ask Order of 76 leader Clare Hoffman to investigate the White Leagues which could turn up more legitimate reasons to arrest or blackmail them, having our top man Harry Bennett aid him. However, this would be extremely risky and Lindbergh is calling for us to ignore them until the conflict is over."

constate.8.d:0 "An Order of 76 chapter leader named Joe McWilliams was killed by a car bomb today outside of his office! An active leader of the Order of 76 and one of our more prominent supporters, he was carrying out an order from Hoffman to undermine the White Leagues in favor of his preferred groups with more direct connections to the government. It is clear that despite us being at war for survival the White Leagues have decided to send us a message and end a potential internal threat to them. Perhaps we should back down until this war is over? Hardliners such as Hoffman want to arrest the heads of the NDWL and hold them hostage until the end of the war but others are cautioning this would be political (and perhaps literal) suicide as the NDWL commands mass loyalty. They instead think we should focus on controlling the economy via government contracts to edge out the NDWL and use their reluctance to move against us during war against them."

In fact, even William H. Murray when asked has stated that the new national leaders have gone back on their word and advocated replacing them. While technically having autocratic power and being impossible to remove without his resignation Lindbergh and his faction simply does not have enough internal support, and as par the course for the Constitutional American Republic other political machines are already working against him and Ford."

constate.10.d:0 "It appears we have underestimated the strength of the White League. During a seemingly ordinary meeting at the headquarters of the Order of 76 in the capital Klansmen burst in with shotguns and pistols and killed several members and members of our government coordinating with them, including our own Clare Hoffman. Shortly afterwards Order of 76 members were openly hunted down and gunned down in the streets with some being strung up as examples. Lindbergh and Ford themselves were in a hideout while this occurred, which apparently the White League did not know until they had already raided the HQ. They have escaped the area and with it, left the country in the hands of the White League who are quickly focusing on the war effort instead."

constate.1000.t:0 "The Imperial Wizard Takes Charge"
constate.1000.d:0 "William Joseph Simmons, Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, has been chosen as a compromise candidate among the Democratic White League given his quasi-genial demeanor and (probably much more importantly) his nominal status of the largest white supremacist organization in the nation. In a speech to the nation Simmons declared a full-throated defense of "Americanism, protestant womanhood, and Christian morality", demanding that Old Democrats either stand with him or the NDWL. He likewise noted the White Leagues recent success in destroying traitors to the nation and declared his intent to spread that action to the rest of the country. With his ascent the Invisible Empire and its "allies" stretches further but most are well aware that he does not have the unity he would desire in the Democratic White League, undermining his own position for the present moment which his more ambitious followers are absolutely enthused with. The military staff on the hand is simply happy that the internal political debates have"

His advisors were not sure of what to do, as Simmons had ordered them not to tell any other underlings. Eventually, they had a doctor from the nearest town come to Simmons' aid. By the time he arrived, Simmons' condition had deteriorated enough that a lack of oxygen to his brain placed him in a coma. Meanwhile, insiders of each major faction of the White League had clearly given away what happened to their leader as D.C. Stephenson entered the room wailing, wondering how the American Emperor could pass in his prime only to discover that Simmons was still breathing, to his obvious surprise. While Stephenson was dismissing the staff, Hiram Wesley Evans showed up to the scene and a tense standoff ensured as each wondered what to do. Evans went to contact his Klan connections in the South and the military, while D.C. Stephenson left to alert his Old Klan allies. Finally, Christian Identity leader and fellow NDWL leader Herbert W. Armstrong entered the building, offering to pray for Simmons but neither Stephenson nor Evans were interested in giving the Black Sheep of the NDWL full access to the American Emperor. With all three major players now here, no one is certain that what follows will be peaceful, least of all General Patton, whom was forced to watch all of this."

With the NDWL not having secured its position over the Republic, or its own unity, they are desperate to cover up his death, but Old Democrats are already reasserting themselves. The lack of a clear successor has left the military with little choice but to assume direct power under Old Democrat George Patton, whom has given a speech commending Simmons for his defense of the Republic and a promise to ensure its continued victory at all costs"

constate.1101.d:0 "George S. Patton has opted to give a speech today, in which he plans to discuss his goals while in power and what his vision is for the country moving forward. Patton, a more studious man than he is often given credit for, has drafted his own speech, refusing to allow his advisors to edit it. The speech contains reflections from Patton about recent events. He takes time to discuss Douglas MacArthur, explaining that MacArthur's vanity made him more of a "sissy" than someone who could fight for America. Furthermore, Patton lambasts him for his actions during the Bonus Army incident, and argues that fighting him was necessary to preserve America. On Butler and the CSA, Patton has surprisingly little, though he points to former President Herbert Hoover's easing of restrictions on unions as partly to blame for the chaos that ensued after. While never explicitly stated, most of Patton's advisors believe he ommitted any mention of the AUS out of respect for his friend, Connor Fox, although there is a strange comment about putting a kingfish wallmount in his quarters. Most of all, Patton's speech focuses on the veterans of the Civil War, calling them heroes for their efforts in saving America. However, he also cautions that now is not the time to be a "yellow coward", and that keeping order and rebuilding America will be a team effort. There will be those who get in the way, but Patton urges his men to "hold them by the balls and kick them in the ass". The speech is fairly mild for Patton, and while he won't let his advisors edit it, he may be open to making it longer. We should make sure he makes a political message as well, but who should it appeal to?"

Old Democrats generally support the status quo of Jim Crow, while more extremist factions would like to see further discrimination against Blacks. Patton agrees with neither, however. While he has always been a vocal racist, Patton witnessed the prowess of Black soldiers during the Civil War. He does not believe that they are equal to Whites, but he does argue that it would be foolish to not utilize them in our military. Given the losses American sustained in the war, men are men, and we need all the help we can get, he argues. What should we do?"

George Lincoln Rockwell, a rising figure in the Klan whose youth may have made him overly bold, interrupted Patton and called him a sellout to Blacks for wanting to allow them into the military. Patton ignored this comment and kept speaking. However, when Rockwell then insinuated that Patton would let a Black veteran sleep with his daughter, the older man lost his cool and slapped Rockwell across his face. The Klan leaders stormed out of the meeting and the news has spread like wildfire, with stories written nationwide about the confrontation. It seems this outburst has guaranteed the failure of diplomacy between the two groups, and now the country anxiously looks to see what the Klan's next move will be."

Patton ignored this comment and kept speaking. However, when Lindbergh then proclaimed that Patton loved Anglo-Saxons so much that he would gladly side with British syndicalists over Germany, the older man lost his cool and slapped Lindbergh across his face.

However, when he found a soldier who appeared to not be hurt at all, he strolled over to the man and asked what was wrong. The man replied that he "just didn't feel good" and that the "stress of war" had gotten to him. A fuming Patton slapped the man across his face and reprimanded him for his cowardice, calling him a yellow coward and threatening him. At one point, Patton even threatened to stand the man against the wall and have him killed via firing squad, or to kill him himself to save time. Luckily, hospital commander Donald E. Currier intervened between the two and prevented further violence. Patton's actions have received mixed reactions among the public, though Fordists and the NDWL see Patton as a potentially unstable leader, and are said to be planning to replace him, privately stating that he has done nothing for them anyawys.

The main candidates to lead the new party are Storm Thurmond, who would lead its conservative, business oriented wing, and Joseph McCarthy, who while quite business-friendly himself could lead a liberal wing more in favor of somewhat liberal social policies.

Now though, he has the important task of choosing the man who will essentially run the day to day operations of his government and make political decisions, even if Patton has the final say on them. Patton has three men in particular in mind for the job: John Elliott Rankin and James Francis Byrnes. Rankin was a loyal supporter of Murray, but appointing him may make it seem like we are shutting out non-ODP members of our government. A darkhorse option, James F. Byrnes, the powerful South Carolina politician who, although more moderate than many of our politicians, could not be said to be a candidate favoring one faction or another. Other proposals have reached Patton's desk, ranging from Fordists to the most extreme portions of the NDWL, but he has declined to endorse any of these, noting that they would be too far in one direction or another to effectively govern the country. However, there still is the option of just picking General George Van Horn Moseley instead - a contentious pick due to complaints that it would lead to permanent military rule, Moseley would be a solid pick, despite his interesting views and rabid anti-semitism.

As three Black students made their way into the school while being harassed by a growing crowd of hecklers and onlookers, a figure in Klan robes stepped forward and threw a rock at one of the Black students, striking them in the head and instigating a brawl that soon erupted into a full on riot. \n\nThe incident resulted in the hospitalization of the one Black student struck with a rock as well as four other bystanders caught in the ruckus, and only ended when the National Guard arrived on the scene after the Police - some of whom supported the other side - failed to get the situation under control. Regardless of this violence, the National Guard were able to get a handle on the situation, and the local Klan agitator that started the violent brawl was arrested for his actions, along with a few others who joined in on the beating.

President Gore is also noted for his environmentalist and conservationist concerns, seeking to expand the National Parks system while cutting back on unnecessary environmental degradation, and is also known for his deep connections to our military, forged and honed over his service fighting for our freedom.

However, Graves is also known for his once-secret friendship with many Klan members, with the KKK even helping him win his first election to the Governor’s seat, and was known to work with similarly-aligned Supreme Justice Hugo Black, with the both of them being referred to as ‘The Gold Dust Twins’ after receiving gold passports from their Klan allies. Despite his dubious friends, President Graves has worked to completely limit the Klan’s ability to commit violence and open prejudice, instead working to morph them into a Christian support and welfare group that focuses on White Christian communities while leaving Black neighbors in peace, where the Federal Government can pick up the slack without letting racism get in the way and without forcing his Klan allies to work with those they rather not associate with.

Son of the famous Southern progressive-conservative agrarian LeRoy Percy that rose to Congress after getting famous battling the Klan in Mississippi state politics, President William Percy follows in his father’s footsteps as a beacon of postbellum Southern liberty. Deeply invested in the Christian faith, with the late LeRoy being a devout Episcopalian that instilled his views into his family while his son President William Percy is a devout Catholic like his late mother and Walker exists as a young member of the Catholic Benedictine Order, the duo is committed to creating a liberal American democracy supported by agrarian capitalism, Christian humanism and morality, an expanded appreciation for America’s own unique culture and artforms, and Catholic Social Teachings along with ideas like Christian distributive populism for the poor. With ties to the farming estates that dominate the South, their agrarian mission shall not be hindered. \n\nWell-connected and a good friend of Herbert Hoover due to their time in the service together, President Percy also has friends among the infamous Southern Agrarians - a group of twelve Vanderbilt University-based intellectuals led by John Crowe Ransom and Robert Penn Warren and ‘godfathered’ by Percy that wrote a socially progressive yet widely conservative Agrarian literary manifesto in 1930 that called for a Southern Renaissance to oppose the rise of the ODP and the Klan and their perversion of free Southern agrarian tradition with reactionary ideology and unGodly racism - as well as among the Fugitive Poets, the Uranians (despite not personally adhering to their more salacious views), and the literary academics of the New Criticism movement; all of which and more inspiring his own poetic career as well as the literary career of Vice President Walker Percy, as well as their journey through politics. Additionally, the Percys have long been allies of Black America, working with figures like Langston Hughes in the past to further Black interests. Quietly also standing as America’s first homosexual president as well, with this knowledge only known to those closest to him, President William Percy works to ease the plight of all oppressed groups throughout America, citing his belief that God made every person how they were made to be and that all men are created equal under God. Now, with the Percys at the helm of the nation and with their allies, influences, and Christian morals behind them, a new and holy dawn shall rise for Dixie as a new Southern Renaissance blossoms here in America."

However, Patton and his advisors control much more land than what they started with, and as such, some are saying that we need to change how we appeal to our wider constituency. Patton, always one to think and act decisively, quickly put forward the ideas of Cowboys and the 'Wild West' as ppossibly appealing to all Americans, as such things had been staples of American culture for decades. Even foreigners have begun to stereotype Americans as Cowboys, and the image fits with Patton's view of how America should be as well. The rough, tough, but ultimately lawful attitude is exactly what he sees as the American way of life, and he is eager for this to be true once again. Being a California native himself, and spending much of his time in the West, Patton believes that this appeal will be successful in giving them the support they need-and perhaps have the side effect of weakening the Klan and the Fordists as well."

The two got along surprisingly well, despite the fact that the Sultan could not technically speak a language besides Arabic to him in public. In private, Patton learned that the man spoke a variety of European languages, including English, and the two developed a friendship. Patton complimented the Sultan on the beautiful architecture of the country, which he described as the best he had ever seen, and the two men shared several meals and ceremonies before Patton left for America.

On face value, it seems these measures would be popular with farmers and other poor Southerners, who would benefit from a more representative and responsible government. It is true that the Old Democrats, and with them, most Southerners, have supported Russell's measures to combat corruption. It is worth noting that the ODP has pressed him to focus more on his own Democratic Party, which they claim is more established and thus has more entrenched corruption. Russell has been open to such proposals, though it seems his loyalty to the Democratic Party is unshakable.

Russell has responded by saying that "a Fordist-led government in the Great Depression would be content to stand by and handcuff the government while citizens starve without being able to lend them any assistance."

For now, Russell and his advisors are content to let them squabble amongst themselves, since they pose little threat. A man who does pose a threat, however, is the powerful ODP politician Eugene Talmadge. Talmadge, who Russell once considered the only man who could challenge his power in Georgia, now threatens him on a national level, despite Russell's victory over the man in the 1936 Georgia Senate Election. In fiery speeches across the South, Talmadge has accused Russell of being a syndicalist sympathizer, and argues that his policies are specifically meant to benefit Blacks. Violence is common at these events, with Russell loyalists brawling with Talmadge's supporters. Russell has not hesitated to respond to Talmadge's accusations, stating that "they are an example of what any Southern politician does as a last resort: cry N****r."  He has also noted that Talmadge has ties to Northeastern Republicans, and has questioned why he is fighting with the Constitutional American Republic at all, saying he would be better suited to life in New England.

By granting further economic stimulus to farmers and ensuring they are our top priority, we will show them that we are on their side, and likely pull most of them over to our side. After all, Russell's advisors argue, economics appeals will be more appealing than racial ones. Still, there is a case for playing Talmadge's game and engaging in racial issues. We may be able to steal support from moderate ODP members this way and make our supporters more radical, though our advisors warn that buying into Talmadge's framework could be dangerous, and Russell is uncomfortable with discussion around such issues.

Bossert, an Indiana politician who is ostensibly a member of the ODP but has secret ties to the NDWL. Such ties are no secret to Russell, though, and supporting a Bossert-takeover of the party would both get rid of Talmadge and satisfy the Ku Klux Klan. Even better, it would de-legitimize the ODP, and drive members who dislike the NDWL into our waiting arms. However, if we want to support Democratic Party interests alone, we could promise to give cabinet positions to some members of the ODP, provided they are loyal to us in the long run.

It seems these activities have not gone unnoticed, and ODP voters are starting to regain confidence in the Democratic Party. Our popularity has soared, and it seems our government is more efficient as well now, with the worst of the corruption being eliminated. It is a new day for the party of Andrew Jackson."

constate.1119.t:0 "The Meaning of States' Rights"
constate.1119.d:0 "The term "states' rights" has traditionally been used in the context of the American South. However, before the Civil War began, there was a Republican plan to extend autonomy on a national level, called the "Home Rule Plan". At the time, the plan was meant to give autonomy to rebellious regions and prevent them from rebelling, and although our goals are slightly different, we could adapt this plan for our own purposes. Their plan limited their control over the country, but ours would increase liberty in the states it impacts. Of course, we could also maintain the traditional meaning of the phrase, and tie the meaning to segregation. If we choose the national plan, it will increase our popularity with Syndicalists, Longists, and other groups, while the local plan will give us support among Southerners. What should we do?"

constate.1120.d.backroom:0 "We have made various backroom deals with Fordist politicians and held rallies that specifically target the average Fordist supporter in our northern territories. However, it is clear that we must take more action to fully handle this threat. There are two potential plans that each have their own benefits. The first would be to champion Southern Fordists, who are the most sympathetic to our cause. In doing so, we can portray the Northern industrialists as traitors, but the Southern industrialists alone will be a poor replacement for their counterparts in the North. It will take some time for them to give us the same benefits as the Northern ones had, but they assure us that they are willing to take up the mantle of production. The other possibility would be to arrest Henry Ford, who has been the primary agitator against President Russell, and hope that that silences the group. While this would certainly deal the Fordists a heavy blow, we must be careful to not be seen as tyrants, and our next move will have to be careful. Which plan should we follow?"
constate.1120.d.aggressive:0 "It seems that Fordists across the spectrum are upset with our recent anti-corruption measures, with many accusing us of syndicalist motivations rather than a motivation to fight corruption. Even worse, we have heard reports of Fordists covertly rallying support for a coup, though Russell has dismissed the idea, not believing that they would be so bold or even have the support for a coup if they were that bold. However, the NDWL is nowhere to be seen, and the ODP has been strangely quiet, leaving some to wonder what their motivations are. It seems our administration may be in trouble..."

For his part, Russell has fled to locations unknown, but many of his cabinet members have been captured. Today is a new day in the country..."

constate.1122.t:0 "Our Next Move"
constate.1122.d:0 "Now that we have taken the first steps to combat the Fordists, we should decide how to deal with the Northern Fordists themselves. Russell's advisors note that with the support of Southern Fordists, we could also reach out to moderate Northern ones, and perhaps even fully restore our industrial might this way. However, if we chose to arrest Henry Ford instead, it may be best to try and court Charles Lindbergh. Lindbergh may be a Fordist, but his pride and ambition make him susceptible to promises of power, and we should give him such guarantees in exchange for his support. Such a deal would likely bring most Fordists to our side, with only the most radical ones still revolting against us. Of course, negotiating with Lindbergh would be a delicate affair, and some advisors say it would be easier to simply arrest him. This may cause more trouble, though."

There are many choices, depending on who we desire most for the position. We could bring William Bell Riley, a foreign policy expert and diplomat, into our administration. Instead of Riley, we could bring in James O. Eastland, who agrees with Russell on the principle of a balanced budget. Still further, we could also pick Thophilus Eugene Connor, who would be the head of security in our administration. Who should we pick?"

constate.1124.d:0 "After Eugene Talmadge fled the capitol, our security forces conducted an extensive search operation for him. For weeks, they had little success, but a recent tip from an anonymous source has led us to his hiding spot, and we now have his house surrounded. We could send Talmadge to New England to be with his wealthy donors, or we could arrest him. Sending him to New England will be a popular if not humorous choice, though it would leave him able to return at some point. Arresting him, meanwhile, might be unpopular politically, but at least we could ensure he is locked away and no longer a threat. What shall we do?"

constate.1125.t:0 "The Klan Question"
constate.1125.d:0 "President Russell understands that the only reason the NDWL and Ku Klux Klan have not challenged him as much as the Fordists and Talmadge have is because they have been busy with internal strife. William Joseph Simmons has been able to keep the faction unified for now, but the lines of the Old Klan, the Young Klan, and Herbert Armstrong's factions are clear within the group. Tensions have risen for years, and it is clear to any observer that they will erupt soon; it is only a matter of time. Anticipating this and predicting an eventual unification behind one faction, Russell has decided it would be prudent to play kingmaker behind the scenes. In pursuit of this, he has called a meeting with Young Klan leader Hiram Wesley Evans, who was happy to meet with the president despite his reservations about his administration. While Russell has never closely associated with the Ku Klux Klan, he and Evans agree on many issues, particularly on a potential plan to send at least some Blacks back to Africa. The two will meet and discuss policy, life, and most importantly, how Russell can be of assistance to Evans in his bid for leadership of the NDWL. Russell, seeing the Young Klan as the least radical of the three factions, sees this as the best outcome, and should decide how he can help Evans before the meeting."

While they lack significant power on their own, they are powerful enough to be a thorn in our sides..."
constate.1126.d.deal:0 "It is a done deal! President Russell and Hiram Wesley Evans have come to an agreement and Evans will become the next leader of the NDWL and Ku Klux Klan. While this will sideline the Old Klan and the Armstrong supporters, they are now too weak to do anything about it, and we will hopefully have one less enemy to worry about, though this will depend if we follow through on the promises we made during the negotiations..."

constate.1127.d:0 "When President Russell made Walter Bossert the head of the ODP, he rightly suspected that the move garnered him favor with the Young Klan. However, there was always the threat of the Klan having more power after such an appointment, and it seems that Russell not following through on his Blacks to Africa plan was the final nail in the coffin for relations between himself and the Klan. The Young Klan and Bossert have coordinated to place Evans in charge of the government, and President Russell has fled to an unknown location, though some speculate he was invited to the residence of rising politician Lyndon Johnson in the West. The Klan now rules the country."

constate.1128.t:0 "The Liberia Plan"
constate.1128.d:0 "Hiram Wesley Evans and President Richard Russell Jr. have agreed to work together to create a plan for Blacks in the South in the coming years. The two generally agree that Blacks should be deported to Africa, to rid the country of them and allow them to live where they believe they are meant to, and yet this policy has proven unpopular with other groups. The remaining Fordists have protested that such a move would weaken corporations and deprive them of a source of cheap labor, the ODP disagrees with the idea of deportation, and factions outside the South believe the idea to be too extreme. Moving forward with this policy would satisfy Evans at the cost of political support elsewhere, while opposing it may anger the Ku Klux Klan. What should we do?"

constate.1129.d:0 "With the Second Civil War over, it will be some years before the event is incorporated into textbooks, as is normal with modern events. This means that we have no ability to shape the debate around this conflict. However, one thing we can influence is the discourse around the First Civil War. Outside of the South, the Confederacy is seen as noble perhaps, yet still wrong, and we should distance ourselves from such a narrative. Already there are many in the original Constitutional American Republic that have volunteered to create new textbooks about the First Civil War. Instead of the current arguments, we should rightly argue that there were good men on both sides, and that each side fought for what they thought was right. We should also emphasize the unity that occurred after the war, in an effort to promote unity in our own trying times. Further, we should emphasize the tyranny of the federal government during the Reconstruction period, in an effort to instill a distaste for such heavy handed governments. This may help prevent another MacArthur from rising in the future. Regardless, the next generation cannot be as divided as this one has been, and we will see to it that the whole country, North, South, East, and West, are united as one."

constate.1130.t:0 "Federal Ban on Mixed Marriages"
constate.1130.d:0 "Defending the southern way of life is a priority for the government under Richard Russell. One of the ways we could ultimately secure the gains of the South would be to extend some segregation laws to the entire country. For example, currently, 30 of the 48 states have bans on racially mixed marriages. Some states (Ohio, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Rhode Island, Washington, Woyoming) used to have laws like these in the past, but have since repealed them. Others (Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota) have never passed them. There have been several initiatives to standardize these regulations at the federal level. A total ban on mixed marriage was postulated by Representatives Andrew King in 1871 and then again in 1912 by Seaborn Roddenbery. The most radical proposal, however, was made in 1928, by Senator Coleman Blease. He proposed an amendment requiring that Congress set a punishment for interracial couples attempting to get married and for people officiating an interracial marriage. What should we do?"

However, more and more of this drug, called 'Marihuana' by Mexicans, is appearing in artistic circles, and many jazz musicians take such drugs before concerts. It can have a demoralizing effect on both White and Colored youth. For this reason, there are voices that say taxing cannabis cultivation will reduce the availability of illegal substances. These same groups have argued that with the invention of the decorticator, hemp had become a very cheap substitute for the paper pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. A ban would therefore increase the influence of wealthy northern industrial families, influence already present in the press and paper market. Examples include Andrew and Paul Mellon from Pennsylvania, Randolph Hearst from West Coast, and the Du Pont family from New England. What shall we decide on this substance?"

Many of the companies based in the American South have used government support to rebuild infrastructure and have attempted to expand their operations across the country. Companies from other parts of the country have also adopted the Christian values of the South, and thus contribute to the healing of wounds caused by crises and war. Nowadays, all over the country, you can smoke cigarettes of the 'N****r Hair' brand after a meal at the 'Coon Chicken Inn' or 'Kentucky Fried Chicken' restaurants. In these restaurants, you can have Dixie and Creole Cuisine and drink 'Confederate-Cola' (a special line of Soda by Coca-Cola Company).

Other orders, and even individual parishes, especially in the South, followed their specific customs. One example of this is the Holy Redeemer Church in Newton Grove, where the communion was distributed first to the White parishioners, and only later to the Black people who were waiting in the vestibule of the church. In 1939, the practice was stopped and a separate chapel was built for Black parishioners.

Unbeknownst to his new wife Nan (played by Laraine Day), Collins is a man with a dark past. Before the Second American Civil War, he was Frank Johnson, a young worker with syndicalist connections. While working in New Jersey, Johnson’s political views drew him into an argument with a shop steward. Johnson killed the man and fled the state, changing his name to Brad Collins and moving South. He obtained a job with a shipping firm and began his life anew. Collins’ new life is disrupted when he runs into Christine (played by Janis Carter), his former girlfriend. Christine is a fashion photographer who is still an active Syndicalist, holding glamorous cocktail parties so she can seduce men and recruit them to the syndicalist underground. The meeting with the former lover starts a series of problems, intrigues, and conspiracies in which there will be spies from Europe, a sinister union boss (played by Thomas Gomez) and anarchist terrorists."

With the help of this field of science, biofuels-a variety of durable ropes or efficient fuel-could be obtained. The industrial application of such scientific achievements intrigued many industrialists, including Henry Ford, and they have pushed for these innovations to be adopted by the federal government as well. Senator Theodore G. Bilbo has gone so far as to encourage investment in the cultivation of industrial crops. In his opinion, this would allow for a quick recovery of both agriculture and industry destroyed by the war. The slogans of rebuilding agriculture in this way reached many nationalist groups (like the White Front in Florida), who not only encourage but insist on the implementation of these programs. Critics, however, point out that increasing the cultivation of industrial crops will dramatically increase food prices. For this reason, the decision is particularly difficult. What should we do?"

As such, their word may be biased. However, the American military has traditionally either denied blood from Black donors or applied the principle of blood segregation so that the White soldier would not receive even a drop of blood from a Black donor. According to logisticians, this is an extreme waste of resources, but according to racial purists like Walter Plecker, it is necessary to keep soldiers from being 'negroised'. What shall we do?"

In response Hiram Wesley Evans has asked James Colescott for an alliance to counter-act this while Herbert W. Armstrong has turned to Christian fundamentalist Gerald B. Winrod by inviting him to be an Elder of Zion if he shifts further towards Christian Identity. The informal factions that have long been present but are finally boiling to the surface are now between Evans so-called Young Klan, Stephenson's Old Klan and finally Armstrong's Holy Church of Zion.

Nonetheless he is well-aware of why this offer has truly come up in that D.C.

According to the driver (whom claimed to have merely exited the vehicle to relieve himself) a wounded Armstrong crawled out of the car and lived longed enough to frantically beg for mercy while offering them money before the men fired upon him. D.C. Stephenson has given a speech over radio claiming that Armstrong had ordered the death of Evans and Evans men had retaliated, making sure to leave out the near-impossible time frame and circumstances of the latter's demise. He then called on the Old Democrats and NDWL to finally vote on the new Leader of the White League for the good of the nation and to show their loyalty to the memory of Evans and against Armstrong's plotting.

They know claim that they should be allow to control Southern California due to being less infamous than the Legion and more accepted. The Black Legion calls this nonsense, claiming they have more members in L.A. and that the territory rightfully belongs to one of their commanders.

The main participants are Evans and Stephenson but even the Christian Identitarians under Armstrong have gotten into the action, seemingly in an informal alliance with Evans. This simply can not go on and the Old Democrats and military have demanded a peace meeting between the three. However our intelligence branch, the Republican Bureau of Investigation, has caught wind that Stephenson simply plans to kill the other two participants at the meeting and then claim the men were killed by syndicalists. To do nothing would be to allow Stephenson to take charge and so Patton is once again forced to make a decision on behalf of the nation, to either reveal the plot or stay out of it."

Black Legion leader Virgil Effinger was quickly captured although Stephenson managed to avoid the same fate with him not being found when his home was raided, although they did manage to find stolen funds and, more shockingly, a small hastily covered grave in the backyard under which there were three civilians known to have been detained by Stephenson's men within his territory. Meanwhile Stephenson himself was busy attempting to empty a Klan headquarters safe before fleeing the area with his main bodyguard Earl Klinck. However they were spotted attempting to drive away and a shootout ensured followed by a car chase which went on for about a mile before a wounded Klinck crashed into a tree with Stephenson caught in the passenger seat. While Stephenson attempted to hold his hands up to surrender White Caps and police nonetheless opened fire on the vehicle until it quickly caught fire, finally finishing the feared Grand Dragon of Indiana."

Stephenson immediately announced that the Black Legion had evidence of a syndicalist plot and that they would do all they could to avenge the men, but also implicated several current members of rival factions for being involved. While Stephenson's enemies do not have the unity or means to oppose him, few believe the official story so if the army moves against him now we would be excused in doing so and in fact many would would be thankful. This would essentially be the end of the NDWL as our national leadership and some officers do not believe it is our place to do such a thing."

After entering, they claimed he killed himself before he could be found, though some soldiers whisper otherwise. Regardless, the NDWL is internally demolished from the deaths of their major faction leaders, and with their complete disunity, they have seemingly lost the faith of the Old Democratic Party and, more importantly, the ability to resist it's non-NDWL faction. With Patton already the de facto top-ranking ODP member in the government, the delegates have decided to formally vote for him and have him re-stabilize the nation, which he accepted with a promise to bring order."

After a Klansman whispered into his ear Hiram Wesley Evans then jumped out of his seat to accuse D.C. Stephenson of conspiring with foreign powers and demanded he be arrested. Armstrong likewise decried a now shocked Stephenson as a 'pervert of the highest order.' Patton and his guards then entered the building and detained both Effinger and his Legion bodyguards alongside Stephenson as the other members of the Democratic White League decried them. A flustered William Bell Riley (officially still the head of state of the Constitutional Republic) was rushed onto center stage to read aloud the charges against a now frantic Stephenson whom switched between denial and decrying every member in the room, calling Evans a 'killer' and Armstrong "a hypocrite". Patton banged the gavel the second Riley was done reading and found him guilty, then had a wailing Stephenson dragged outside to the nearest tree and hung by four men holding the other side of the rope until he finally died. The question was now what to do with Effinger, with Evans demanding he be executed as well while Armstrong remained silent although some army men did not look forward to the Black Legion's reprisals if this occurred. The military men and Old Democrats are well aware that this effectively means that only two men remain in the ring and that Patton will have to side with one of them, as Joseph T. McNarney being armed with a pistol and ready to end Effinger on his say so."

He also promises to generally create a more stable republic under his rule. This is certainly not unappealing for Old Democratsm, who have to live in constant paranoia of having to choose whether to support White Leagues policies (and having a target on their back as a result), or risk becoming an enemy to the League. Nonetheless the hardliners are fanatically opposed to this. They have given Armstrong an opening while Evans' Klan is busy battling the remnants of the Old Klan, despite some being uneasy with Armstrong's heretical form of Christianity. Armstrong is attempting to make an alliance with Gerald B. Winrod and ultra-right Klan chapters, and is now reaching out to William Bell Riley as well to order Evans to stand down for selling out white civilization to the demonic forces of liberalization and modernism. Himself a fundamentalist with mixed-feelings on Armstrong's brand of Christian Identity, William Bell Riley does see the appeal of Armstrong's leadership. The Old Klan militias are still focused on fighting Evans and meanwhile, Armstrong has kept himself from the worst of the fighting and does have potential as a unity leader. While sympathetic to his request, Riley is well aware his power is nearly nominal and thus asks Patton for military backing if he were to issue such an order."

He has publicly come out to endorse Hiram Wesley Evans and pre-emptively 'thank him' for accepting Christian Identity as a positive influence on America. While still too powerful to finish off, Evans has decided to accept his endorsement and called a new meeting of Congress to formally declare himself what he already is; the head of the NDWL and the nation itself."

But a ray of hope shone through for the increasingly paranoid Apostle whom was now ordering members members of his own congregation to keep an eye out for the 'false prophets' when a Black Legion leader based in an outpost nearby, William Shepard, offered an alliance against Evan's so-called 'compromise' policies. Armstrong was suspicious of his demands and demanded he be allowed to bring his guards while Shepard brought none. While surprised Shepard agreed, putting the Apostle of Christ at ease whom still would not show his face until Shepard was within range of his men. Now well aware there was no reasonable way Shepard could have set him up without also dooming himself Armstrong was ecstatic while walking through a prairie chatting with his new ally whom might be able to get a man close enough to Evans to end his rival when suddenly, from the tree line, gunfire opened up on Armstrong, Shepard and the bodyguards. While it is uncertain whether or not the Apostle himself was already dead when the attackers fired a shotgun at his head from point blank range, it is known Shepard was almost certainly still alive when he was finished off as he angrily stated he did what was asked of him and told them to go to Hell."

This effectively signals the death kneel for anti-Evans resistance as others are falling into place save for the remnants of the Black Legion, the Knights of the White Camelia and the core leaders of the Elders of Zion whom are all still less than pleased with their leaders recent unfortunate passing."

The Black Nationalists would prefer if the Black South was made into an autonomous zone under their control, but paying tribute and agreeing to an alliance with the larger United States. They claim this will allow them to enforce racial purity within their own borders while fighting those whom fail our moral standards, and would make it easier to gain black military allies. Likewise, they encourage us the deport 'pure-blooded' Blacks to their region. Race 'moderates' in the Young Klan and UNIA however would prefer if we simply sponsored a back to Africa mission to cut down on our black population in a way that conformed to their goals and granted some more autonomy in the south.

While Virgil Effinger gained greater fame than Lupp within the Legion and eventually wrested control of most of the Michigan Legion, Effinger's recent fall from grace has left Lupp as a more prominent member.

While most of the anti-Klan factions privately consider the boys to have been innocent it makes little difference as they have already been executed. Nonetheless, Starnes standing against mobs looking to avenge white honor is a stretch too far for many even if he claims it was out of legal duty only, and some are wondering if we should force him to step down from his position."

This is true among official designations such as state and local office, and they are also an organizing force on our behalf. As such, some members of the ODP have been jockeying to be appointed the head of the party and to increase their status in the process. Some believe the head of the ODP should be an NDWL member, and thus more outright subservient to us and officially a wing of the NDWL, while others want to keep them as a controlled opposition force, seeing them as more useful in this role. The fight is between Walter F. Bossert, whom wants to represent the ODP as a member of the NDWL, and Eugene Talmadge, who wants to remain more independent but would command more traditional Old Democrat loyalty. What shall we do?"

However, there is the issue of older teachers still being present, many of whom had liberal connections prior to the war. It is doubtful that they will enthusiastically teach our new tenets, and they may try to avoid teaching them at all. As such, we could appoint a committee, headed by John Rankin, to examine centers of education and teachers. This committee will ensure teachers keep up with our new standards, rewarding those who do and punishing those who don't. The only question is what to do with the teachers we already know would be skeptical of our ideas, as arresting them en masse would leave us with a shortage of teachers and larger classes."

The writings and speeches of the late Mildred Lewis Rutherford have become increasingly popular, alongside membership into the Daughters of the Confederacy, while statues of male veterans have been increasingly erected across the nation. Some are wondering if we shouldn't adjust the education system and our national rhetoric to simply outright depict the war as one against the tyrant Lincoln at this point, although Northern ODP members (amongst others) believe it would be dangerous to the American Nationalism that gives us legitimacy over the rest of the nation and to keep our 'official' line on the civil war more neutral, albeit while allowing the Confederate revival in the process."

After [COR.GetLeader] gave a speech outside the Egyptian in Hollywood early this morning he went in with national Klan leaders to watch the famous film by D.W.

Celebrating this historic achievement, a cross was burned on outside the capital today after this speech, which stated that Congress would soon combine the positions of Klan Leader and NDWL leader which, for all intents an purposes, allows the Klan leadership to legally rule for life.

Some within the organization want for it to be required as university and even high school-level reading in related classes, but the tendency for both of these writers to split the White race into sub-categories make some nervous. Some disagree with their theories of Nordic superiority over the 'Alpine' and 'Mediterranean' race, or with Grant's belief that the 'Mediterranean' race holds abilities above the Nordic one. Others think the explicit and codified subcategories will make our appeal among Whites more limited as well, with some believing we should stick by current Klan policy of the "One-Drop Rule" and just dealing with different White races on a case-by-case basis."

However, the moderate wing of the ODP, supported by the Fordists, have instead noted that we should promote a national American culture now that the Civil War is over, and that such a holiday could anger Americans in other regions. They believe that the end of the Second Civil War should be a holiday instead, as it could serve as a holiday that everyone would celebrate.

A segment of the NDWL is growing increasingly worried about Armstrong's leadership feeling he is not up to the job, particularly under the remnant of the Young Klan's Youth League that has long held him contempt for overthrowing the Young Klan. The Warriors of Elijah think we should move against them now, before they have a chance to strike, though this will make our war effort worse for wear."

constate.5101.t:0 "Armstrong Dead!"
constate.5101.d:0 "Herbert W. Armstrong is dead! After the Young Klan stormed the headquarters of the Church of Zion while he was speaking with heads of the faith, they were unceremoniously gunned down. The leaders of the coup are the youth leaders of the Young Klan whom survived the former purges, George Lincoln Rockwell and Francis Parker Yockey. Already they are announcing their intention to restore the nation, and bring peace and stability to white Americans everywhere while warning enemies of the new regime that they would 'not be met with mercy' if they stood in their way. But which shall lead the nation must be decided within their inner circle."
constate.5101.a:0 "George Lincoln Rockwell"

constate.5102.t:0 "The Law of Biological Integrity"
constate.5102.d:0 "The NWDL has declared, in their new scientific approach that the first law of group living in the animal world is that of biological integrity. This law says that one must hold an absolute, uncompromising loyalty towards their group. This loyalty comes from love and it is vehemently against any outsiders who try to mix with the racial group. While many have declared that this 'Natural Law' is nothing but pseudoscientific nonsense meant to justify prejudice. Regardless, we must implement this law, for a tribe without loyal members is no tribe at all, and the same is true of our society!"
constate.5102.a:0 "The Creator insists on purity!"

constate.5103.t:0 "The Law of Territory"
constate.5103.d:0 "Unlike the vile Marxists and Syndicalists, we hold private property in high regard. After all, what is one of the most important goals of a gang or tribe? It is to stake out a "turf", a place for their group to reside in. The American manifestation of this ideal is through private property, and we must defend this property fiercely. Those who follow this law have been titled "Nationalists", and it is this ideology that we must follow. America is for Americans, and while we have nothing against the other gangs of the world, this is our land. We must defend it fiercely if we hope to hold it in the long run..."
constate.5103.a:0 "We will defend our turf!"

constate.5104.t:0 "The Law of Leadership"
constate.5104.d:0 "In the animal kingdom, leaders are never chosen by a 'vote'. No, in these groups, leaders are chosen through natural selection. The strongest and best individuals in each group rise to be the leaders, and the rest of the group follows a hierarchy beneath them. We cannot allow the vile mob rule that characterizes democracy. Instead, the toughest among us will lead, and through this understanding, we will be widely loved by our people!"
constate.5104.a:0 "Peace and order in our society!"

constate.5105.t:0 "The Law of Status"
constate.5105.d:0 "Similar to how our society must have its leaders, the other members must have their place as well. This law entails the natural order of ability of each person in society. They will all find their rightful place under the leaders, and each man will be respected for his loyalty. Farmers, laborers, soldiers, factory workers, it matters little, for all these men will be loyal to the nation, and they will be rewarded for their effort!"
constate.5105.a:0 "All is as it should be!"

constate.5106.t:0 "The Law of Motherhood"
constate.5106.d:0 "In nature, females stay out of the affairs of males, but today, this is not the case. To have a healthy society, we must have a female population that specializes in producing the next generation and rearing and organizing families. Millions of families lack the warm, nurturing mothers they need to raise children. These were the types of mothers that existed a mere century ago, and we must restore this state of affairs. We will honor women for their ancient roles as mothers, as wives, and most importantly, as the authors of good people."
constate.5106.a:0 "The Five Laws will order our society!"

constate.5107.t:0 "Combatting Cultural Parasitism"
constate.5107.d:0 "President Yockey has been holding a number of radio addresses and proclamations on the air about what he and his cabinet dubbed a 'process which will combat the cultural parasites and rot that threaten American society'. The main target of this process is the Black community in America, about whom President Yockey must now make a decision that will surely shape their lives. While the Black community in America has been living here for centuries and arguably could remain so if they lived in the separation they had in the South before the Secession War, Yockey believes it is crucial that this segregation is heightened and stricter to prevent what he calls cultural leeching. The other option we have is that of adopting the Liberia Plan, choosing to send the African-Americans back to Africa in the holdout of Liberia. What will we choose?"
constate.5107.a:0 "They can stay, just keep them at arm’s length"

constate.5108.d:0 "The Agents of Jacob were established under the Armstrong regime as a secret police and espionage organisation to enforce Christian Identitarian rule, committing horrific crimes against our own and hindering our coup in the process.\nNow that we are in power, we have the opportunity to exact revenge on these scum, and bring them to justice for abuses in the Armstrong era. However, our government is divided on whether we should allow the more junior Agents, many of whom only joined to advance their careers, to go free and transfer to loyal NDWL and Klan groups, or simply bring the entire organisation to justice."

constate.5109.t:0 "Ending Christian Identity"
constate.5109.d:0 "Christian Identity, Armstrong's heretical and degenerate cult which he sought to enforce on America, was officially banned shortly after its coup, with unease at its absurd doctrines having motivated many people to align themselves with the putsch in the first place.\nHowever, the Church remains influential in some areas of the country, particularly the Deep South where Armstrong focused recruitment efforts in the Civil War. This will only undermine our government in the long term, so we must find a means of stamping out Christian Identity for good.\nTo this end, some in the government believe that we should force all officials to pledge themselves against Armstrongism and generally tighten legal repression of the institution, while others favour an intensified propaganda campaign involving greater exposure of abuses under Armstrong's government, although this may implicate some of our own. Against both these groups, many in the military would rather we simply instituted violent crackdowns against known Christian Identitarians."

constate.5110.t:0 "Settling the Jewish Question"
constate.5110.d:0 "As all of the NDWL factions have long invariably believed, the Jewish population of America and the world is a subversive and self-interested element, uninterested in contributing to American society and linked to Bolshevism and cultural degeneracy.\nNow that we have secured our hold on power, it falls to President Yockey to settle the matter of our future policy towards the Jews. The moderates in our government want to revive William H. Murray's 1936 campaign promise of Jewish segregation, ensuring that Jews across America are placed in their own self-contained communities within designated cities.\nWithin the hardliner opposition to this, there are many nativists who would like to see Jews repatriated from America, across the Canadian border and on to destinations of their choosing far from our pleasant land. Meanwhile, there are those who believe that Yockey should not underestimate the lucrative possibility of cheap Jewish labor."

constate.5111.t:0 "America for Christians"
constate.5111.d:0 "Rockwell’s intense disdain for Jews and other religious minorities in America has been ever known since his first public appearances and speeches. Even before his rise to power, Rockwell had many supporters, including the wealthy Harold N. Arrowsmith, who funded many of the young leader's early operations against these groups. These operations included burnings and attacks on Jewish-owned businesses and property. With Rockwell in power, his gangs have now been able to act with impunity, as laws have been put in place that allow them free reign on attacking groups that Rockwell deems as "socially corrupt". With a new campaign he has named "America for Christians", Rockwell has started an aggressive message across America that promotes Protestant Christian groups and even other Christians but officially targets religious minorities and paves the way for "unfortunate disappearances" of large groups of people that Rockwell has marked in his messages of being "criminally dangerous" in their beliefs. It is thought that these disappearances have taken the form of deportation, though further details are unknown." 
constate.5111.a:0 "Disappearances you say?"

constate.5112.t:0 "Fighting Crime"
constate.5112.d:0 "Rockwell has announced a new struggle against "the criminal population" of America and those who have reasonable suspicion to commit crimes in the future due to "ancestral ties to crime and degeneracy". Following these announcements, there was a significant increase in policing budgets, particularly for police and national guard stations in the Deep South and Black Belt of America. These efforts have led to a noticeable increase in the police presence in Black neighborhoods in cities and the rural parts of the South, with even national guard troops forming patrols in areas such as Tulsa, Oklahoma. With the restoration of order in mind, police departments have been increasing arrests for breaking Jim Crow laws and fining African-Americans with charges of "causing a commotion at late times" even for those simply walking out past 5 P.M. Even the death penalty has been increasingly used in state’s prisons against prisoners who have already been imprisoned for years before the new crime fighting bills."

constate.52.t:0 "Christian Critics"
constate.52.d:0 "Christian Protestant leaders are not enthusiastic about adopting Christian Identity as its tenants go against traditional Christian doctrine, especially the claim that the British and therefor the Americans are the true descendants of the Jews. Prominent Southern Baptists such as Lee Rutland Scarborough and Monroe E. Dodd have written papers refuting our stance on specific doctrines despite admiring some of our views. Perhaps we should pressure the SBC to be more in-line with our beliefs?"

constate.53.d:0 "The Feast of Tabernacle begins soon and we must decide which work is permitted and which isn't. A celebration of the forty years the children of Israel wandered the desert, work is certainly not permitted on the first day. However if we are going to stop our population from celebrating Pagan celebrations and have them respect truly Christian ones we may want to ban all but the most vital work during the next seven days."

constate.54.t:0 "Divergent Thinking in Christian Identity"
constate.54.d:0 "The Holy Church of Zion has done its best to screen for religious beliefs when recruiting, but our new recruits often propagate beliefs that do not fit the Simmons-Armstrong line. One group out in California called 'Mankind United' claims that America's savior is their local minister. Another has insinuated the government is willing to assist Catholic nations in their liberation. The potential threat to our power is limited, but at the same time disunity breeds contempt. The Elders of Zion are divided as to whether these ideas are dangerous enough to stamp out. What are we to do about these outrageous claims?"
constate.54.a:0 "Let the innocent lies rest."
constate.54.b:0 "Wickedness must be stamped out."

constate.55.t:0 "Rise of Speakeasies"
constate.55.d:0 "Despite the overwhelming wave of approval Prohibition received within the loyal Christian community, there were some with reservations. In the cities and up high in the mountains, illegal alcohol production has been reported by our agents. The demon drink is being produced by these moral traitors and is transported overnight to underground bars across the nation. We must stop this affront against our values, and catch the deviants responsible."
constate.55.a:0 "Alcoholism must be stamped out."

constate.56.t:0 "Breaking Catholicism"
constate.56.d:0 "Our war on those who see America a Godless, Pagan nation has reached new heights as we turn our attention on those who criticize our theology. Most notable of these is Fulton J. Sheen, a Catholic theologian who hosts 'The Catholic Hour' and has heavily criticized our anti-Catholicism and stances on Christ. After being arrested for denouncing the recent mass firing, investigation and occasional arrests of anti-state Catholics, Sheen was arrested and is now being interrogated for information related to the Papacy and underground terrorist networks. This will coincide with deeper investigations of Catholic and so-called 'Liberal Theologians' whom if found to be dangerous being penalized with deportation, arrest or other means."

constate.57.t:0 "The Liberal Retreat"
constate.57.d:0 "Liberals throughout the nation writing for papers such as the various 'Times' or denouncing our regime are increasingly being killed due to resisting arrest or arrested for their connections to anti-government extremists. Even Democrats such as Richard Russell Jr. are feeling the pressure to step down from public life, and a laundry list of liberals who slipped through arrest after our initial victory such as Jesse H. Jones are being arrested, alongside the various 'youth activists' organizing against us, especially in the West."

constate.58.t:0 "ODP and Churches Crack"
constate.58.d:0 "With our purge of the remnants of the Young Klan's Youth League that refused to join the Warriors of Elijah, Youth Leaders Francis Parker Yockey and George Lincoln Rockwell are dead. The ODP has felt increasing pressure to either retire, join our ranks or, if otherwise useful, keep quiet. Even former ODP leader John E. Rankin has kept quiet despite his known earlier opposition to our faith, and the Southern Baptist Convention has adopted planks adopting heavy elements of Christian Identity after Lee Rutland Scarborough was pressured to stand down by federal agents. Other churches that were once stubborn are either following their lead or their pastor's are being arrested, notably those calling Armstrong a 'false prophet' such as Conrad Bergendoff."

constate.5800.t:0 "Chicago Massacre"
constate.5800.d:0 "A demonstration of protesters made up of an unlikely alliance of Lutherans, socialists and liberals joined together to denounce the regime from their soapboxes shortly after barricading the inner city of Chicago. With their lack of arms however the State Guard broke up the rally, resulting in the deaths of over 65 heretics. Shortly afterwards a riot broke out, resulting in over 1300 further deaths. While we managed to retake the city, it seems socialism has not yet been broken in Chicago. The Warriors of Elijah would prefer martial law to finish the job, whereas the Agents of Jacob believe counter-espionage and targeted assassinations would better do the trick."

constate.5801.d:0 "While Christian Identity has gained steam, it is still a minority of true believers. Of course, most heretics are too fearful or unorganized to truly stop it but in some isolated towns in the Midwest, especially Illinois, Minnesota and Nebraska, locals are not only refusing to shift their theology or give in to the government but have taken up arms. The town leaders of these revolts have formed a loose 'Granger' alliance, although they have few means of aiding one another directly besides coordinated attacks on the Warriors of Elijah and the State Guard. Armstrong would prefer to make an example of the revolting 'townies' by wiping them off the map, although some of the cabinet thinks merely taking them back would do."

constate.59.t:0 "Black Education Act"
constate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Simmons in order to solidify Christian Identity into the youth of America is nearly complete. His final act, which passed with unanimous approval by the delegates, is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and, in particular, African-Americans. Notably it makes it illegal to teach education to African-Americans divorced from their role as laborers, distances them from older notions of religious unity across races and slashes already minor public spending on Black Schools. As part of his speech announcing the law, Simmons stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics, when it cannot use it in practice?'."
constate.59.a:0 "It's for the best"

constate.60.t:0 "The Black Belt Act"
constate.60.d:0 "One of the more controversial acts that Armstrong is proposing is to extend the 1899 Indian Appropriations Act into the African-American community. The proposed Black Belt Act would make communities in the South with majority African-American populations into a reserved space with independent public services. At least on paper, Armstrong claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous state support to African-Americans nationwide. Black inhabitants of the region will be banned from entering White territory. What shall become of this act?"
constate.60.a:0 "Perfect"
constate.60.b:0 "Not Now, Maybe Later."

constate.61.t:0 "The Pass Laws"
constate.61.d:0 "The Armstrong government has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. The Church of Zion strongly discourages any comparisons to past laws and has defended the law as necessary to preserve the nation's Anglo-Saxon-Israeli heritage. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Republic in order to intensify segregation, a policy in-line with Armstrong's fervent opposition to race-mixing in most forms."
constate.61.a:0 "Papers Please."

constate.62.t:0 "The Penal Act"
constate.62.d:0 "While the Thirteenth Amendment made slavery illegal throughout the country this was little more than a show of force by a group of radicals to subjugate the South and was never part of the original Constitution. As such, the 13th Amendment has been repealed to the applause of NDWL delegates. However, to wholly bring back slavery would be too difficult and unpopular among all but the most hardline NDWL factions, and as such a new order signed off on by the President has increased the sentence time for moral crimes, and provided for more use of indentured labor in industry, thus being named the Penal Act, something that was far more palpable to the population. This Penal Labor has been given boost by our reviving of various Black Codes. The boisterous speeches Klan representatives delivers on the radio celebrates this defense of White Protestant morality."

constate.63.t:0 "The Third Great Migration"
constate.63.d:0 "Those thousands of African-Americans that left America before the civil war are being joined by hundreds of thousands more fleeing White Leaguer terror. Groups like the International Labor Defense and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate masses of people struggling to remain free. To the White Defense Leagues and their leaders, this plays into a long-standing fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally, the safer loyalists can sleep. The question is: what shall we do? Shall we let them leave, or shall we keep them here?"

Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
constate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Simmons is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America."
constate.64.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Simmons should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
constate.64.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
constate.64.d.hawaii:0 "An incredible amount of the Pacific separated us from the carnage in America, as well as the hand of the terroristic White Leagues. We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Silver Legion that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers."

### Klan ###
constate.65.t:0 "NDWL Expansion"
constate.65.d:0 "Since their promotions the NDWL is gaining increasing numbers among soldiers and new recruits, giving them widespread influence over the military. Increasingly they are using this to pressure Old Democratic party members in the Senate to sign up for the NDWL and are pushing out our Fordist allies from their influence by handing out military contracts to NDWL supporting businesses and states. Most shockingly, even Captains of the National Guard are switching their allegiance despite technically answering to Old Democratic Party Governors. It is clear that William Joseph Simmons is gathering support to become the leader of our Republic but to demote them would damage the war effort at this point. Of course, expanding their influence would anger the Black population we are attempting to keep a lid on at the moment."
constate.65.a:0 "Not much we can do"
constate.65.b:0 "Disallow it"

constate.66.t:0 "Simmons Calls for a Convention!"
constate.66.d:0 "William Joseph Simmons and the NDWL has called for a special convention in [COR.GetCapital] to allow for himself to be appointed head of military operation and the de facto Commander-In-Chief of the nation. He has acknowledged the ODP as allies and says the current President will be rewarded for the loyalty via political and military appointments but states the NDWL is still the future of America and their empowerment is necessary to save America from 'left radicals, liberals and their duped Negro supporters'. With the backing of Hiram Wesley Evans Klan, D.C. Stephenson's various white leagues and terrorist groups, Armstrong's and the Christian Identitarians endorsement and even many ODP members no longer resisting it is clear he will be appointed Commander-In-Chief. While the Constitutional American Republic does not exactly allow for this as the head of the nation is currently empowered with virtually unlimited autocratic powers the ODP does not have the stability needed to hold its ground and to oppose the Klan-political machine it would be the end of the Republic. "

constate.68.t:0 "Black Taxation?"
constate.68.d:0 "Some members of the ODP and NDWL are pushing is to increase our taxation of black neighborhoods for the war effort. Arguing that their loyalty is tenuous to the new state and that their 'disloyalty' to the cause and that their challenges to our social structures resulted in this war. As such ODP member John E. Rankin and NDWL leaders are requesting we use their resources for the war, and as retribution, before it is used against us. Of course other ODP members and the military advise against this, noting we can not afford to anger the Black population as riots and black militias would be massively damaging to our war effort instead suggesting we respect their relative autonomy in their own neighborhoods for now."
constate.68.a:0 "A dangerous suggestion"
constate.68.b:0 "It's time they paid up"

constate.69.t:0 "Black Conscription?"
constate.69.d:0 "While our taxation of Black Neighborhoods was profitable, it has increased Black Resistance to our goals, causing cries to further penalize them. Most of the ODP and NDWL, including Young Klan General Wickliffe Drapper, do not think Blacks are mentally capable of being proficient combat soldiers. However, with our shortage of numbers and black resistance to sacrificing for the CAR there are widespread demands to conscript black soldiers for menial labor jobs, support positions and basic infantry charges. Obviously this would greatly anger the 'Black Belt' that houses most of our black population and our internal police services recommend it although our political factions are strongly pushing for it."
constate.69.a:0 "Do it"

### ODP Events ###

constate.70.t:0 "Democratic Party Absorbed"
constate.70.d:0 "As the ODP cements its stronghold over the nation, our loyal opposition in the Democratic Party has come to be absorbed in increasingly large number by the ODP. Richard Russell leads the final sizeable chunk of traditional Democratic opposition to the ODP, desiring a more liberal government, alongside some allies further West. Of course, all notable elections apart from a handful of seats are already decided by the ODP's slate, but we could make it more difficult for the Democrats to run by ignoring more of their candidacies and not even bother debating them, simply running slates even in the few areas of the country where the Democrats are present, leaving Russell without allies and only allowing the most loyal opposition Democrats to remain."

constate.71.t:0 "Legality of the Republican Party"
constate.71.d:0 "The Republican Party has been a traditional foe of the ODP, save for of course the far-right sections of that converted to the ODP anyways. The Party housed both progressive and so-called 'conservative' Industrialist wings that were openly anti-ODP, anti-farmer, anti-tradition and for banks and corporations, and sided with the PSA, New England and MacArthur over us, with Tafts, 'Landon Republicans' and Roosevelts all denouncing us. With the ODP dominant on nearly all levels of government, the question of whether or not to allow the party to continue to exist legally at a local level, if only for the handful of former Republicans who were aligned with us and to avoid a potential appearance of tyranny. Most would prefer if it was simply outlawed however."

constate.72.d:0 "As apart of our outreach to native communities aligned with our cause, the old idea of the State of Sequoyah has returned, which would see the East most part of Oklahoma being made into a small state for the nicknamed 'Five Civilized Tribes'. The Tribes have stated they would be willing to give more support in return for the territory, although some ODP members and especially NDWL members would prefer if we just gave them some more autonomy without giving them a full-fledged state. Of course, William H. Murray himself famously favored the proposition, making it that much more likely."
constate.72.a:0 "Create the State of Sequoyah"
constate.72.b:0 "Just grant more autonomy"

constate.73.t:0 "Reorganizing Farm interests"

Many organized farmers were unreliable during the war, often leaning towards the AUS and SPA although much of the American Farm Bureau and Future Farmers of America did breakaway to support us. As we focus on farm issues it's been suggested to merge the FFA and AFB into the National Democratic Farm Bureau, which will help train youth farmers, organize and educate them on relevant issues and introduce them to advanced and new farming methods, alongside research. ODP members such as John E. Rankin have proposed simply doubling down on using the ODP which, while more unorganized for farm issues, would be more useful in advancing political causes and would be an easier pill to swallow for those opposed to what could be viewed as a form of unionization, albeit one with heavy ODP influence."

In order to reconcile Jacksonian Democracy with a One-Party State, two proposals have been put forward. The first is from the NDWL and political bosses such as Talmadge would see a continuation of our current policy of offering ODP slated candidates, who can then be elected by the population for local election. From there, we can pick and choose the most popular and party-friendly candidates to move up the ranks to ensure a representation of the people. The other proposal put forward by Carl Vinson and John H. Bankhead II would somewhat invert the process, toning down the choosing of slate candidates to allow for more open local elections while only allowing pre-selected ODP members to run straight for, and control, higher offices while responding to local elections. Of course in both cases for the national government most positions will be selected by the ODP when relevant, either by only offering them as the only feasible candidate or ensuring their election by other means in return for them serving the state and people of America, but one would use closed local elections before choosing the more popular candidates while the other would open local elections but leave national government more insulated."

Furthermore, the Black Legion is to end all 'terror' attacks, in return being offered amnesty for those already performed. The question of whether to keep the Klan separated at the state level or to consolidate them in a National Force under Hiram Wesley Evans is up for debate, the former being better for keeping them unorganized and the latter to more easily regulate them."

Now however investigators have privately relayed what has been long rumored but never confirmed, which is that Stephenson is an alcoholic, legally a bigamist and engages in debauchery. Much worse however is what was not even rumored as he appears to be a sexual deviant whom used his position in Indiana to assault women, especially POW's during the war. It will likely not be long before this becomes public, even if it's not by our hand. As such, to avoid the ODP having to suffer public relations damage from association with him we have been advised to either arrest him or to have him removed more... quietly."

Focusing on being the founder of a “New Republic” and leaning heavily on his experience in the Civil War he has begun to inflate importance to the war effort, retelling crucial battles that he had no part in as only won because of him. This flagrant rewriting of History has angered some but a majority of the populace, unaware or misremembering the exact details of battles sometimes taking places years ago have bought into this new Moseley.

This marriage of government and industry has many progressives and liberals dismayed as they predict doom and gloom for the workers' future. However the Department has already shot back.

However the violence such an attempt has brought only shows that our two races are too far different from one another to live together. That is why segregation is the only true and natural state for American society. However President Byrd has made it abundantly clear that even though the Negro and White man are separate they shall still be equal.

As the Democratic Party began to split Byrnes, a Southerner, naturally gravitated to Murray’s camp. However Byrnes remained at an arms length due to Murray also attracting the Klan.

Wallace further accuses Byrnes of spreading these ideas secretly through his policy, infecting our Constitutional Republic with the foul plague that is Socialism from within like a cancerous tumor.

Newly appointed judges nicknamed ‘Chicks’ who are Byrd loyalists have taken root in most major metropolitan areas and begun to build networks of their own, loyal to Byrd. They have met resistance, most notably in Kansas City and Chicago, but with federal backing its only a matter of time before these vestiges of the old order fall. Through the Organization Byrd will further a new movement of White Civil Rights, which broadly seeks to bring Southern racial values to many Northern cities. Byrd, while personally disgusted by segregation, does believe that Black and White Americans are incapable of living together in a civil society. There is simply too much bad blood between the races for any hope of peace.

The Party was founded to fight for the White Man and the Common Man, to make sure that his voice has been heard among the hustle and bustle of Washington. In the century and more that its existed the Party has largely stayed true to that vision. However, to stay stagnant for over a century would mean defeat. That is why the Party has adopted a revolutionary new program in a recent national conference. The Party now seeks to curb immigration, restore the balance between the White man and the uppity Negro and to make America the number one nation on Earth once more. While liberals worry about what every single person may think and may want to go out of their way so nobody may be offended, the Democrats see the nation for what it is. America was at her best when she kept all the filth out and only accepted the best of the best seeking home on our shores. She was at her most strong when the Negro knew his place and the White Man was sure of his. She was at her more virtuous when every man, woman and child worked hard and prayed harder. Under the borderline Syndicalist Republicans that vision wavered.

Going so far as to urinate into a bucket off to the side of view with one foot still on stage as an aid held up a towel to block the view from the rest of Congress, this brazen legislator - Rush Limbaugh of the infantile Progressive movement the Committee of 48 -, has held up Congress longer than any one person has before, continuously speaking and rambling to fill up the time as to not get booted off the podium for the uninterrupted duration of the 24 hours, except for a 5 minute break allotted to him at around the 23rd hour mark allotted to him by Representative Goldwater so that he may insert the days notes into the Congressional Record. Padding out his tirade by reading aloud from various books and newspapers in between political rants and speeches on the need for reborn Progressivism and a third party to oppose Republican and Democratic corruption and Conservatism as he sipped on orange juice and snacked on pumpernickel bread and hamburger, Limbaugh’s little stunt truly was something to behold, but has done next to nothing to stop Thurmond’s agenda.

At the same time Thurmond was photographed multiple times meeting with Washington during one of his many trips to his home state. The President and Mrs May both declined to comment on the matter. With the printing of the report the embattled President's administration has begun to receive broadsides from both sides of the isle. Conservatives and Dixiecrats, once the administration's most staunch allies and led by freshman Congressman George Wallace of Alabama, have begun a blistering campaign accusing the President of miscegenation, hypocrisy, crimes against the White Race and a slew of other charges. Meanwhile the liberals, always enemies of the President, have revived an old attack ad on Grover Cleveland, who allegedly had a bastard of his own, depicting a woman consoling a (black) baby who cries “Ma! Ma! Where’s my pa?” and the woman responds “Gone to the White House! Ha! Ha! Ha!” while a caricature of Thurmond stomps his feet angrily."

constate.7684.t:0 "Gathering the Flock"
constate.7684.d:0 "As America broils with anti-Syndicalist rage President McCarthy has begun to gather allies to him like flies. Some of the more prominent ones are the Army, who at one time were suspicious if not outright hostile to the Administration. As time has passed however the higher ups have begun to see the world through the President’s eyes and they have seen a world saturated with Syndicalist infiltration. General Moseley has led the crusade by announcing that his 13th Army has undergone ‘liquidation’ with the execution of 13 alleged Syndicalist-leaning officers and the imprisonment of an entire division that Moseley deemed to have suspect loyalties. While the Joint Chiefs have not shared Moseley’s own strict disciplinarian punishments, they have testified to Congress that a recent investigative probe has revealed deep Syndicalist infiltration in all military branches. They outlined a plan to weed out this alleged subversion and have begun to round up those they have deemed particularly dangerous. Some have noted that the first of those arrested are those who are enemies of the Joint Chiefs. However none point it out too loudly, lest they too be painted with the Red Brush. Another ally has been the Catholic Church. Always an enemy to leftist ideology in most of its forms, for most of American history they have however stayed largely out of politics. After the Civil War however, that policy seems to have changed as preachers across the nation, mainly Catholic priests, have come out publicly and loudly against Syndicalism. They denounce it as Godless, baseless mockery of the natural order and tantamount to Heresy. These priests and dioceses, mainly in New England where Catholicism has been on the rise since the Civil War, have also spoken in support of the President who is an avowed Catholic himself. This view has been helped by the President’s long standing friendship with the Kennedy family who are some of the most prominent Catholics in the United States. "

He then presented a list of 300 names of people who were members of the Syndicalist Party or known associates of members. This has sent the entire country into a determined hunt to weed out the subversive filth among them. Police stations across the nation have reported an increased number of calls over ‘suspicious individuals’ as neighbors now question their neighbors every move. Within the halls of government its reported that everybody is looking over their shoulder, second guessing every decision and going out of their way to prove themselves more ‘American’ than their coworkers lest their name may be on the list."

This taint on the Party’s image has, since the Second Civil War, refused to fade away. However with the overturning of the previous illegal administration the tide of ‘progressivism’ and liberalism within the Party seems to have ebbed. The Conservative Republicans, once firmly in the minority due to the sheer abundance of Negro Republicans overwhelming the White vote, have begun to reassert themselves. Progressives in the Party are finding themselves increasingly marginalized and the Party has begun to harken back to its roots in the Know Nothing Movement and the Nativists. The Grand Old Party has begun to wash itself of the nastiness of its past and in the most recent party platform said nothing of civil rights. Instead the Party has decisively shifted to curbing immigration and supporting domestic improvements. This move has been viciously attacked by the liberals and minorities within the Party however, despite their ferocious attempts, the Party is no longer under their insidious control.

Influenced by New Deal ideas, tied to the Southern kings of cotton, and one of the only men in our new America that pushes for giving the vote back to Black Americans, Crump certainly is a unique figure in our government. Tied to the Democrats, Crump butts heads with even his own party mates as he bulldozes his way through any and all obstacles in order to further control his favored city. Advisors to the President have warned Russell that going after Crump - especially this early in our own term - could prove to be damaging or even disastrous to our administration.

constate.310.d:0 "With the Second American Civil War slowly fading into distant memory and with the great Alfalfa Bill Murray standing resolute at the helm of our great republic, this great nation and our noble people have slowly begun to heal. With this recovery has also come a fond remembrance for older times in America, to a great President who served this nation so dutifully in an age before our nation was ever sullied by the horrors of fratricide. \n\nThis great Commander in Chief was none other than Andrew Jackson, 7th President of the United States and a champion of the people against carpetbaggers and anti-American elements, has become something of an idol to our healing people, with many in our nation likening President Murray to this hallowed and deeply honored figure. \n\nThis adoration is not just hollow praise and fanfare however, for which it has also begun to affect the nation as a whole. The New Jackson, as Murray has quickly become known as to many ardent patriots, has become the idol of a new cultural resurgence, harkening back to the post-Revolutionary age of this great nation that was the Jacksonian Era. With tastes in food, music, and other aspects of both high and low culture shifting to emulate and modernize the Jacksonian aesthetic, the wider identity of the Constitutional American Republic has already begun to show signs of this new Jacksonian Golden Age. \n\nMost curiously of all the aspects of our society affected by this has been its effect on the fashion industry, which has unexpectedly taken off with the idea completely. A new wave of New-Jacksonian fashion has exploded onto the scene, with puffy-armed shirts, double-breasted and stand-collar waist coats, stocks with bows, and fall front trousers - all clothes designed for the common working man - exploding in popularity once more with the men of our fine republic. Not to be left out, women’s fashion has also taken a large turn, with loose-corsets, semi-puffy skirts, and other designs with labor in mind typical of the original Jacksonian era of the 1820s-40s. Most popular of these new designs has been the return of what has been colloquially dubbed the ‘Jacksonian suit.’ Usually a black ditto suit or frock coat tuxedo with flared collar and large lapels atop a white shirt, and frequently accompanied with a flowing red cape to emulate the famous Ralph Earl portrait of the national hero, these suits have exploded in popularity across the nation. Though more popular among the most elite and upper class of our republic, that has not stopped these dashing numbers to become a common sight in cities across Dixie and beyond, with even President Murray occasionally being seen wearing one. \n\nWhether it be affecting fashion or art or cuisine, this new Jacksonian Golden Age has proven to be a much needed distraction for our war-torn populace. Time heals all wounds for sure, but nothing like a little nostalgia to help numb the pain and speed along the process of reconstruction, of both nation and spirit."

Though we shall keep these lands under our direct control like was always planned, we must decide upon how - should we maintain our Americanist identity and symbolism while directly integrating these lands, keeping the capital in Dixie and the culture of our state purely American, or should we fulfill the full extent of Bickley’s dream, moving the capital and government apparatus to Havana, Cuba as a centralized administrative center in the middle of the new nation while pushing for a new culture based upon that of the old Confederacy?"
constate.4094.a:0 "Stick to our Americanist foundations."
constate.4094.b:0 "We shall proclaim a true Golden Circle to further Klannist interests across the New World."

constate.4095.t:0 "A Flag for the Golden Circle"
constate.4095.d:0 "With the Golden Circle finally rising across the tropical heart of the New World, we must now choose what flag shall rise along with it. The obvious suggestion is to use the original flag of the Knights of the Golden Circle founded by George W.L. Bickley in 1854 - a white and red trie color with a blue canton holding 11 white stars. However, another suggestion is to use the legionary flag of the reborn Knights of the Golden Circle - a contemporary revivalist secret society based on the original order founded and staffed by many prominent Old Klan members. Their flag depicts the Golden Circle’s cross and sun surrounded by stars and the crescent moon on a blue field, with red and white stripes beside it."
constate.4095.a:0 "Go with the flag of the original Knights."
constate.4095.b:0 "Go with the modern Legion flag used by the reborn Knights."

constate.4096.t:0 "Fate of the Confederados"
constate.4096.d:0 "With many of their kind allegedly being members of the original Knights of the Golden Circle before fleeing to Brazil following the final days of the First American Civil War, the Confederados - or Confederate Americans that fled the Union’s victory by running to South America - may have lived in exile all this time but perhaps their fate can be changed. Swayed to Brazil by former emperor Dom Pedro II using promises of cheap farm land and easy settlement in order to utilize the cotton-farming expertise these fleeing sons of Dixie held, the Confederados and their offspring have resided throughout northern Brazil for almost a century now. With the dream of the Golden Circle finally realized, perhaps we could save these lost sons and daughters of Dixie from their plight?"
constate.4096.a:0 "We ride for Rio to save our brethren for the apelings beside them."
constate.4096.b:0 "Leave them to that jungle hell they ran to like the cowardly rats they are." 

constate.4097.t:0 "The Black Legion Steps Out of Line"
constate.4097.d:0 "With his criminal past coming back to bite him in the ass once more, Imperial Wizard of the Klan and President of these new United States, David Curtis Stephenson, has become recently embroiled in a leadership struggle as the Black Legion - the Klan’s paramilitary arm-turned-rival organization - try to seize power. Headed by army veteran-turned-White supremacist vigilante Virgil Effinger, the Black Legion is a band of racist pirates and White supremacist bandits that became infamous and influential by doing the dirty work even the Klan didn’t want to do, and now having risen to the top of the Klan’s hierarchy, Effinger seeks to use Stephenson’s past against him in order to take power for himself. Responsible for the murder, rape, and partial cannibalization of 28 year old Madge Oberholtzer in 1925, D. C. Stephenson was largely able to escape justice, but did not stop his devilish ways, and has since continued his deranged and sickening habit behind closed doors. Threatening to reveal this continuing career of serial murder and rape to the wider nation, Effinger hopes to blackmail Stephenson out of power so than he and his Black Legion can truly lead America. If Stephenson can manage to out-wit Effinger and have him and his organization destroyed before Effinger gets his way is unknown, but the future of the Old Klan once again hangs in the balance."
constate.4097.a:0 "Stephenson outmaneuvers Effinger, having him silenced and quietly killed."
constate.4097.b:0 "Effinger forces Stephenson out, and the Black Legion rises to lead America."

constate.4098.t:0 "Effinger’s America Under the Black Legion"
constate.4098.d:0 "With the Klan now firmly under his control as Stephenson is forced into early retirement and sudden obscurity, Virgil H. ‘Bert’ Effinger and his Black Legion now control the fate of America, and as such, Effinger must decide on how to take the Klan and the nation in this new age. Describing his movement as a guerilla army designed to fight the establishment, Effinger claims that the Black Legion has existed since the era of the first American Revolution and the Boston Tea Party, rewriting history and forcing the masses to learn his new truth while working with allies like Arthur Lupp, Arthur Hornbui Bell, Alma Bridwell White, Margaret Sanger, and other New Jersey-based Klan associates in order to more smoothly integrate the Old Klan’s hierarchy into their new Black Legion structure. \n\nThough still sharing most typical Klan ideas, with Effinger’s personal hatred of immigrants, Catholics, Jews, Blacks, labor organizers, communists, socialists, and more finding him many allies within the KKK, the Black Legion’s methods of open murder, arson, banditry, vigilante justice, organized crime, and above all piracy has driven a wedge between them and traditional Klannist ideology. Famous for raiding Jewish synagogues, Catholic churches, and Socialist meetings across the coasts of the Great Lakes while leaving a trail of dead minorities brutally butchered, burned, or gunned down in their wake, and with pockets full of stolen loot weighing them down as they sailed off from each raid, the Black Legion is markedly different in how they operate among the racist Far-Right in America, and many wonder if this pirate culture will now influence America as a whole..."
constate.4098.a:0 "Continue to largely adhere to the baseline ideology of the Klan."
constate.4098.b:0 "Embrace our true nature as the racist pirates of the Great Lakes!"

constate.500.t:0 "The Army Requisitions Civilian Trucks"
constate.500.d:0 "After Patton announced his Motorisation program for the new American Army, a proposal was sent to President Long to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fastly-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."
constate.500.a:0 "The Kingfish Thanks your Service"

constate.501.t:0 "First Paradrop Exercise"
constate.501.d:0 "While technically speaking, the first paradropping exercises were practiced in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved in the airborne department. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Lawson Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their exercise goals, making the experiment a success."
constate.501.a:0 "Start Scheduling New Jumps"

constate.502.t:0 "Formation of the First Paratrooper Divisions"
constate.502.d:0 "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General Patton, Fort Benning had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."
constate.502.a:0 "'Death from Above'"


constate.7000.t:0 "A Connection to the Past"
constate.7000.d:0 "As the looming deadline to stand-down foolishly declared by MacArthur inches ever closer, the Old Democratic Party has begun to attempting to foster a new national identity, as a way to prepare our people for the slaughter to come. The idea being, that if the population can be convinced that we alone are the true Americans, they will have an easier time fighting those that only a short time ago were fellow countrymen. While these efforts so far have been mostly attempting to create a fresh identity, free from the shackles of the past, many if not most of these efforts end up calling on the Confederacy. While a failed and fallen state, a large section of Dixie still finds common cause with Confederate States of America. Thus, it comes as no shock that Confederate flags, battle flags, guns and other such relics have popped up like weeds around the Constitutional Republic. Of all these relics, perhaps the most interesting is those various Confederate veterans that have endorsed our cause. Perhaps the most influential one of these men is John Salling.\n\n Declared an honorary Confederate general, Salling is said to have been a saltpeter digger in the Confederate Army, claiming to have been born in 1846. General Salling, joining the Old Democratic Party shortly after it's formation, has become an incredibly popular figure to the public, being akin to living proof that the cause didn't die with the Confederacy. With a second war coming ever closer, many within the Party have begun to call on President Murray to formally grant General Salling an honorary position within our armed forces. By doing this, President Murray would only furhter endear our government among the people, and it would greatly aid in the fostering of a national identity, or so they claim. Others within the Party believe this to be the wrong move. While we do owe much to the Confederacy they say, by such an appointment, we may give the wrong message to the rest of the country. A very small minority within the Party believe that we should actually grant Salling a proper commission, and formally join him to a unit. While such a move would unpresented, it would erase any doubt that we are not the proper heirs to the Confederate Cause.\n\nWith a divide growing within the ODP over the 'Salling Issue' on the eve of war, President Murray to prevent disunity in a crictal moment, has moved to..."
constate.7000.a:0 "...formally give Salling an honorific title."
constate.7000.b:0 "...reject the proposal."

#AUS's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

COR_GEORGE_MOSELEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 28, 1874, in Evanston, Illinois, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Van Horn Moseley graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1899 as a cavalry second lieutenant. He would serve in the Spanish American War commanding the 9th Cavalry Regiment where he even managed to achieve a major breakthrough against Ludovico Arejola, prompting a promotion to first lieutenant and a transfer to the 1st Cavalry Regiment. There he'd serve as Aide-de-Camp for Brigadier General J.M. Bell and J.M. Lee for the remainder of the campaign, fulfilling several staff roles in the rear. He'd be transferred back to the US in 1904, and would serve as a staff member of the Texas Headquarters, until being promoted to Captain in 1906. He'd continue to fill a variety of staff roles while at the same time attending the Army Staff College and the Army War College, of which he graduated in 1909 and 1911 respectively. He took part in Pershing's punitive expedition, providing logistical support to Pershing, and earning him the promotion to major. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organizing the Bureau of the Budget in 1921, after which he was promoted to Brigadier General for his remarkable performance. He'd become Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War and was put in charge of the Industrial Preparedness sector, which got him his promotion to Major General. In 1934 he had a major fall out with General MacArthur, and with the country's collapse into civil war, Moseley's first course of action was to leave the Federal Army and join the Constitutional Army in the south, where his experience and the lack of capable staff granted him an immediate promotion to Field Marshall by William H. Murray.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong anti-immigrant and anti-semitic views both publicly and privately.\n- Along with Charles Lindbergh, Moseley has been seen in frequent meetings with important businessmen from outside the military sphere."
COR_GEORGE_PATTON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 11, 1885, in San Gabriel, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton vocally opposed his colleague constantly, and he decided to leave to the Constitutionalists, seeing that the Federal Government was bound to fail if decisive action wasn't taken. With his reputation preceding him, William H. Murray decided to skip the rank of general and name Patton an outright Field Marshall, a role which Patton claims to be more than prepared to fulfill.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While publicly his loyalty remains unquestioned, his former friendship with Dwight Eisenhower make many members of the staff distrustful of Patton\n- Has displayed strong racist views in public."
COR_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel. With Patton and Marshall vocally opposing MacArthur, Hodges was forced to choose between either one of his friends in case the situation deteriorated. He chose the former, as Patton managed to sway Hodges into joining him in the CAR Army, where the now Field Marshal Patton has offered his friend Hodges an early promotion to Brigadier General."
COR_WILLIAM_SIMPSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 18, 1888, at Weatherford, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In June 1905, a month after turning 17, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated four years later in June 1909, being commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch. Simpson's first assignment was with the 6th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lincoln, North Dakota. Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."
COR_WALTON_WALKER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 3, 1889, in Belton, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Walton Harris Walker began his military career when he joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1907 and entered the United States Military Academy in 1908, graduating in 1912 as an infantry second lieutenant. He'd be posted mostly in garrison duties throughout Texas, where the only exceptions where when he took part in the Veracruz Expedition, and taking part in the border patrols along the Mexican border, where he befriended Dwight Eisenhower. After 1920, Walker served as an instructor at Fort Benning, Georgia and underwent further tactical training by the Army, attending the Command and General Staff School in 1925 and graduating in 1926 as a lieutenant colonel. He'd be moved to the American Legation in Tianjin in 1930, and would return to America in 1933 to sign up for the Army War College, where he graduated in mid-1936. As the situation in the country deteriorated, Walker started to side with Patton during the staff meetings, deeply criticizing MacArthur for his inaction against socialists. When Huey Long finally declared the American Union State, Walker decided to join his colleague Patton in the south, who granted him the rank of Brigadier General."
COR_MATTHEW_RIDGWAY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 3, 1895, in Fort Monroe, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Matthew Bunker 'Old Iron Tits' Ridgway began his military career in 1913 when he successfully passed the entrance exam to West Point after failing the year prior. He graduated from the academy in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. Ridgway was first assigned to patrol duty in the Mexican border with the 3rd Infantry Regiment, where he reached the rank of Captain and would return to West Point in 1920 as a Spanish teacher. In 1925, Ridgway graduated from the United States Army Infantry School, after which he was sent to the American Legation in Tianjin and later sent to Nicaragua, where he was one of the American COs trying to supervise the 1927 elections. In 1930, he'd be transferred to the Philippines, where he became an advisor to the Governor-General of the islands and would return to America in 1933 as a Major. He'd graduate from the Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and was attending the Army War College in Pennsylvania before the Civil War broke out. With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harrassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government. When Huey Long finally proclaimed the American Union State, Ridgway decided it was best to leave for the AUS if that was necessary to save America from anarchy, where he was promoted to Brigadier General."
COR_BRUCE_CLARKE_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 29, 1901, in Adams, New York, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Bruce Cooper Clarke joined the National Guard in 1918, where he earned an appointment to the United States Military Academy in 1920. He graduated from West Point in 1925 as a second lieutenant of the engineer corps, and in the same year, he'd earn his civil engineering degree and a bachelor of laws degree, serving mostly on staff roles until he was promoted to Colonel in 1935. He had became one of Patton's trusted officers after the major splits within the American Army, and when Patton joined the American Union State, Clarke decided to follow him and for his loyalty he was awarded the rank of Brigadier General by Patton."
COR_HENRY_HODES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 19, 1899, in Washington D.C., United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Irving Hodes began his military career when he joined the United States Military Academy, from where he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1920. After fulfilling a series of staff roles, mainly in Wyoming and Texas, he found himself strongly advocating for the mechanisation of the American Army along with Patton, which due to the army budget cuts, it became nothing more than a pipe dream for them. As Patton began to slowly drift away from the US Army staff, Hodes strengthened his ties with the 'Old Blood and Guts', and when Patton finally announced he was joining the Union States, Hodes accompanied him and was promoted to Brigadier General."
COR_CLIFTON_CATES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 31, 1893, in Tiptonville, Tennessee, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clifton Bledsoe 'Lucky' Cates began his military career after graduating from the Missouri Military Academy in 1910 as a second lieutenant for the Marine Corps Reserves. His excellent performance in drills and his qualifications caught the attention of the then Brigadier General George Barnett, who took Cates as his aide-de-camp. Cates would serve with Barnett until 1923, where Cates, who was now a Captain, was assigned to command the Marine detachment in the USS Arizona. In 1928, he was transferred to the to the 4th Marine Regiment in San Diego which would be transferred to guard the American Legation in Shanghai. He returned to America in 1932, where he signed up for the Army Industrial College and the Senior Officer Course of the Marine Corps, graduating in 1935 and reaching the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. He'd return to Shanghai in 1936, but would take his leave in late March 1937. As the country spiralled into Civil War, Cates was visiting his family in Tennessee. Seeing the chaos in his hometown, which had been ravaged by a fire when he was young, Cates decided to join the American Union State and convinced his colleague Lewis Puller to join him, becoming a Brigadier General for the AUS Marine Corps, and along with 'Chesty' Puller, one of the most important Marine commanders of the American Union State."
COR_CHESTY_PULLER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W June 26, 1898, in West Point, Virginia, United States of America \n§YMilitary Career:§W Lewis Burwell "Chesty" Puller decided to sign up in the army at an early age but was refused because he couldn't get parental consent to join. Until he became 21, he decided to study in the Virginia Military Institute, and after graduating in 1919, he attended the non-commissioned officer school and Officer Candidates School of the Marine Corps, earning the rank of second lieutenant. In 1921, he was assigned to the Gendarmerie d'Haiti and would see over forty skirmishes fighting the Caco rebels and becoming adjutant to Alexander Vandegrift. After four years of serving in garrison duty in the United States, he'd be assigned to the Marine detachment in the Nicaraguan National Guard in December 1928. In Nicaragua, he led several engagements against the Sandinista forces, where he was able to prevail despite being outnumbered significantly by the Nicaraguan rebels, and earning the Navy Cross medal. He returned to the United States in 1931, and completed the Company Officers Course at Fort Benning which he had left pending in 1928, graduating in June 1932 as a Captain and returning to Nicaragua in September. There, he took part in the Battle of El Sauce, where he earned his promotion to Major. He'd be then transferred to command the 'China Marines' in Shanghai in 1933 and would return to America in June 1936 to serve as an as an instructor at The Basic School. With the nation spiralling into Civil War, Puller was persuaded by Cates to join the American Civil War as Puller was indecisive as to who to support. With his arrival at Louisiana, Puller's actions in Nicaragua and Haiti had earned the respect of many members of the staff and Huey Long's cabinet, who pushed for his promotion to Brigadier General."
COR_JOSEPH_MCNARNEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 28, 1893, in Emporium, Pennsylvannia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Joseph Taggart McNarney graduated from the United States Military Academy in June 1915, having attended lessons with great officers like Omar Bradley and Dwight Eisenhower. McNarney served with the 21st Infantry Regiment at Vancouver Barracks, Washington, and with the 37th Infantry Regiment at Yuma, Arizona. He became one of the first first lieutenants to begin flight training when he signed up to the Signal Corps Aviation School in 1916, from where he'd graduate a year later as a Junior Military Aviator. He was promoted to Captain in May 1917 and posted in New Mexico. He'd later take charge of the flying school at Gerstner Field, in Luisiana. He'd move in late 1920 to Langley Field, where he became a student of the Air Service Field Officers School and remained in Langley as an instructor. He'd graduate with honors from the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth in 1926, and he completed the Army War College course in 1930. He succeded Major Spaatz in the 7th Bomb group after Spaatz promotion. McNarney then became an instructor at the Army War College in Washington, serving from August 1933 to March 1935, where he was redeployed as an attaché to Canada. With the outbreak of the Civil War, McNarney decided that it was best to leave to a place where his particular skills were in short supply, and join the Constitutional American Republic, the faction that closest aligned with his views. The Constitutionalist staff was more than happy to welcome him from Canada."

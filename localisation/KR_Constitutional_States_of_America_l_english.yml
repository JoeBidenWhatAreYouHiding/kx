COR:0 "Constitutional American Republic Focus Tree"

### Parties ###
COR_totalist_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_totalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - It is bad enough that we have socialists and syndicalists in our nation, but the worst of all may be those who can loosely be called "totalists". These radicals advocate an authoritarian leftist government that would see our way of life snuffed out by force. Their platform has support with a significant enough part of our Black population to be threatening to us. We must do something about them..."
COR_syndicalist_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - The syndicalist menace has come to our shores, in the form of the IWW and other organizations. One of the policies they advocate the most in our towns and cities is equal labor rights for the White man. Further, they seem to support greater integration of Blacks into society, perhaps even an eventual end to segregation. These policies would threaten the fabric of our society by pitting White against Black, Rich against Poor. These outside agitators have no right to tell us how to live our lives, for we can determine that just fine ourselves."
COR_radical_socialist_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - These bleeding-heart socialists may claim to care about all people, but we see past their thin veneer of ideology. If they cared about all people, why do they never address the poor Southern farmer, who is god-fearing and hard-working? No, what they really want to do is turn our Black population against us, and perhaps even cause a race war in the South! We cannot let them destroy our homes and our culture."
COR_social_democrat_party:0 "Socialist Party"
COR_social_democrat_party_long:0 "Socialist Party of America - So called "Federalist" members of the SPA, not supporters of the old government but those who support the ideology of social democracy, seem less radical than the other socialists on face value. Indeed, they support a more peaceful form segregation in our country, and some wish to return to an era where Blacks could vote. These beliefs are not entirely unreasonable, though we should attempt to negotiate with them, and convince them of our beliefs. With time, perhaps they could be redeemed and brought into the fold."
COR_social_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Progressives) - The Progressive Democrats are not a very common sight in our states, but they exist nonetheless. They represent the farthest left that the party is willing to go, oftentimes seeming more like Northern Republicans than other local Democrats. Their advocacy of a Social Security system, more education for Blacks, and free-trade oriented policies make them somewhat controversial, but they can be brought to the table nonetheless."
COR_market_liberal_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Liberals) - More liberally-minded Democrats are numerous in our towns and cities. These Democrats advocate for a laissez-faire economic system, charity for the poor, and a generally reduced government footprint in our society. These policies are agreeable, though they probably do not go far enough. Further, there are many who argue that total free-trade could put our economy in jeopardy. We should carefully consider their proposals and implement a select few into our government."
COR_social_conservative_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Conservative) - The Democratic Party has served us well in its long existence, but today it has morphed into an apparatus that no longer can support the interests of the White man. It is a husk of its old self, and most Democrats have now joined the ODP. However, the talented politician Richard Russell has plans for the party, and hopes to reshape it in his image. Perhaps more ambitiously, he wishes to win back the voters the old party of Andrew Jackson has lost as of late. To do so, he will need to face the daunting task of making the ODP irrelevant, and in the process, he will likely meet an old foe. His prospects may be bleak, but his relationship with William Murray and his adherence to most ODP politicies makes him a more than acceptable choice for us."
COR_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Democratic Party (Machines) - The Democratic Party machines have controlled the South for decades. They have grown complacent in their success, ignoring the suffering of our poor farmers, especially recently. However, these politicians agree with us on most things, and they could easily be brought into the fold, if we promise them something resembling their old power. Instead of breaking this faction, we should bring them under our wing, and together we can bring a new age to America."
COR_paternal_autocrat_party:0 "Old Democratic Party"
COR_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party - The mainstream of the ODP all agree to support the interests of the White man while opposing Catholics, Jews, and Leftists. The supporters of the ODP come from both the Republican and the Democratic Party though, and within the party there are many disparate factions. Alfalfa Bill Murray is the leader of the party, for now, and he has unified most of them. However, Charles Lindbergh and the Fordists diverge from Murray in their greater support for corporatism, and there are some who wish to see George Patton lead the party as well. Murray will only be able to lead the party for so long, and when he is gone, the question of who will succeed him will be important indeed."
COR_national_populist_party:0 "Old Democratic Party (NDWL)"
COR_national_populist_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party (National Democratic White League) - The NDWL represents the various factions of the Ku Klux Klan as well  as the numerous White Leagues of our nation. Together, these two groups make up the backbone of the NDWL. However, this does not mean they all agree on the same message. William Joseph Simmons is generally agreed upon as their leader for now, but there are already many who are jockeying to succeed him. Hiram Wesley Evans, D.C. Stephenson, and Herbert W. Armstrong are the main contenders. Evans supports the newer branch of the Klan, while Stephenson represents the older branch. Meanwhile, Armstrong preaches unity between the two Klan factions, arguing that a different path can be followed."

COR_national_corporatism_paternal_autocrat:0 "Old Democratic Party"
COR_national_corporatism_paternal_autocrat_long:0 "Old Democratic Party (National Corporatists) - The traditionalist and agrarian mainstream of the ODP, dominated by Southern populists such as William H. Murray and Eugene Talmadge, has given way under the pressure of powerful Northern nationalists, with their money and influence turning the tide.\nThis newly dominant wing of the ODP, centred around the charisma and popularity of Charles Lindbergh and economics of Henry Ford, which has also absorbed the Republican Party's far-right fringe under Clare Hoffman, takes inspiration from the corporatist policies adopted by many rightist states around the world.\nPromoting a vision of American nationalism that is no less racist and anti-semitic than that of Murray's ODP, but is also much less Southern-centred and agrarian, the Fordists push for greater industrialization and a vision of the state that their opponents, including many in the KKK, see as emblematic of the Yankee elitism that the CAR rose up to fight."

COR_old_klan_national_populist:0 "NDWL (Old Klan Faction)"
COR_old_klan_national_populist_long:0 "National Democratic White League (Old Klan Faction) - Following the death of William Joseph Simmons, the Old Klan, under the leadership of D.C. Stephenson, has emerged triumphant after an internal power struggle in the KKK that culminated in the deaths of Stephenson's rivals.\nAs opposed to the New Klan, which advocated a conciliatory attitude to some groups formerly attacked by the NDWL and sought to build a more orderly state, Stephenson's government is thoroughly uninterested in compromise, and sees the sole duty of the state as being the promotion of the interests of the White Race, a cause for which anything can be sacrificed.\nThe extreme violence of Stephenson's allies in the Black Legion, alongside the general contempt for legalism within his government, makes it likely that under "The Chief", America's ideals of the Rule of Law may be changed forever."

COR_social_conservative_patton_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_conservative_patton_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The Democratic Party is in urgent need of reform. Luckily, Harry F. Byrd has agreed to rebuild the party in a way that Patton approves of, getting rid of party machines and their other corrupt practices. While they will remain separate from the Old Democratic Party, it will exist as an option for more moderate conservatives in the country, and with such support, may stand a chance of winning election someday."

COR_market_liberal_patton_party:0 "Republican Party"
COR_market_liberal_patton_party_long:0 "Republican Party - The conservative faction of the Republican Party has returned under the leadership of Strom Thurmond, who plans to remake the organization in his own image and hopefully carry it to victory someday."

COR_social_liberal_patton_party:0 "Republican Party"
COR_social_liberal_patton_party_long:0 "Republican Party - The liberal faction of the Republican Party is led by Joseph McCarthy who agreed to switch over from his old Democratic Party allegiance in order to help rebuuild the Republican Party. Though he is still fairly conservative by mainstream standards, he is one of the most liberal members of American government now, and perhaps one day he will even lead the country."

COR_social_democrat_patton_party:0 "Democratic Party"
COR_social_democrat_patton_party_long:0 "Democratic Party - The more liberal faction of the Democratic Party will be led by James Francis Byrnes. Not a liberal by any means, he is still more open to government intervention and stimulus programs than someone like Harry F. Byrd. As such, he has been deemed as sufficient to lead the liberal wing of the party, perhaps rebuilding it from ruin and leading it to victory one day."

COR_authoritarian_democrat_patton_party:0 "Old Democratic Party (Patton)"
COR_authoritarian_democrat_patton_party_long:0 "Old Democratic Party - George S. Patton has taken leadership over the ODP and plans to lead it in a different fashion to his predecessor, "Alfalfa" Bill Murray. Patton, yearning for the America of old, styles himself as the president, and hopes to ease some of the restrictions Murray placed on the country, though the specifics of these are as of yet unknown. However, it is true that Patton has a program to instill discipline into the country to help it rebuild and prosper once more. With Patton in charge, there will be stability at last."

### Ideas ###
COR_black_legion_resistance:0 "Old Klan Resistance"
COR_black_legion_resistance_desc:0 "The Black Legion is out of control, and now resists our government. While we admire them, their ideas are outdated and their outlook is old. It is a new era, and only the Young Klan can succeed!"
COR_black_nationalist_1_idea:0 "Black Resistance"
COR_black_nationalist_1_idea_desc:0 "There has been a significant increase in tensions with our Black community. Some of the more bold members of the community have even taken up arms against us, and others damage our infrastructure to weaken us. We should work to put this group in their place." 
COR_longist_resistance_1_idea:0 "Longist Resistance"
COR_longist_resistance_1_idea_desc:0 "The Unionists claim to represent the common man, farmers in particular, but they do not represent Dixie. Their radical ideas would threaten everything we believe in. Particularly, some of their left wing elements are advocating for the dismantlement of the old Jim Crow system. These rebels must be stopped!"
COR_mob_activity_1_idea:0 "Mob Activity"
COR_mob_activity_1_idea_desc:0 "Some of the criminal scum that have ravaged our nation for years are now targeting our government. Particularly, they have used alcohol as a tool to gain immense power and wealth in our borders. If these thugs aren't stopped, they could destroy the very fabric of our society."
COR_syndicalist_resistance_1_idea:0 "Syndicalist Resistance"
COR_syndicalist_resistance_1_idea_desc:0 "The radical syndicalists, in addition to other leftists, have done considerable damage to our country. Now, they are targeting us, trying to snuff our beloved country out and replace it with an abomination. We should have no mercy for these people, and anytime one is found, they should be severely punished, if not hanged, for their actions."

COR_federalist_activity_1_idea_desc:0 "The Feds had their chance to run this country, and they blew it. Now, they are fighting against our government, trying to make sure we are as much of a failure as they were. We can't let them succeed. We should work to snuff out Federalist resistance and convince our people that our government is the legitimate one."
COR_fighting_for_car_idea:0 "Fighting for the CAR"
COR_jim_crow_idea:0 "Jim Crow"
COR_jim_crow_idea_desc:0 "Named for a popular caricature of a stereotypical black slave that went on to become a pejorative for black Americans more generally, the Jim Crow Laws are an intense form of racial segregation with the goal of promoting white supremacy. Virtually all public facilities are segregated, interracial marriage is banned and black Americans are often used for cheap labor. This allows us access to cheap resource extraction, an easy means of empowering our supporters and the sympathy of hardline white supremacists throughout the nation. However, this comes at the cost of our widespread loathing among blacks, other minorities and non-white supremacists more generally which not only means they are loathe to join the military but that manpower has to be put forward to prevent rebellion. Furthermore, our economy's lowered pool of human capital and high reliance on simple labor-intensive resource extraction slows economic and technological advancement in most other areas."
COR_jim_crow_idea_2:0 "National Jim Crow"
COR_jim_crow_idea_2_desc:0 "With the executve better coordinating the Old Democratic Party's racial policies by state and shifting resources appropriately, alongside the encouragement of new counter-espionage methods, we have streamlined the Jim Crow system to be more efficient for the state and lowered the possibility of resistance. Segregation shall remain the norm in the CAR today, tommorow and (with the ODP in command) forever!"
COR_native_collaboration:0 "Native Collaboration"
CON_native_collaboration_desc:0 "With the granting of greater autonomy and even a new state to friendly Native American tribes we ensure their support in the form of political backing of our wing of the ODP and requested recruits eager to defend their new alliance."
COR_cavalier_ideal_idea:0 "Cavalier Idealism"
COR_cavalier_ideal_idea_desc:0 "Our veneration of Cavalier heroism and culture via the schooling and military process as well as in the public square has not only been a massive moral boost to our soldiers but should gradually induce a white population more willing to fight for its new rights and to embrace our values."
COR_state_militants:0 "Old Democratic State Militias"
COR_state_militants_desc:0 "With each state being entrusted to raise militias for internal control our national army not only has had its resources freed up but we can call upon these governors for support when the need arises, many of whom are especially skilled and fervent while fighting on their own land."
COR_old_dem_schools:0 "Proper Education"
COR_old_dem_schools_desc:0 "For too long, our schools have been infested with lies about American history. It is time that we overhauled the system and expanded it to rural areas so that all of our children can access the education they need to succeed in the society we are building. More imporantly, we must teach our children our values so that they do not fall prey to syndicalism or other forms of vile propaganda aimed at destroying the very fabric of our culture!"
COR_afforable_goods:0 "Affordable Goods"
COR_afforable_goods_desc:0 "The state wrangling of utilities to lower their prices to consumers, especially those that are apart of the ODP's base, has done much to ease our citizens economic discomfort."

Let us continue the party in the tradition of Jackson and sweep away the corruption that has enveloped it since then. We will be a party of the common man, the white man, once more!" 
COR_farmers_relief:0 "Farmer's Relief Program"
COR_farmers_relief_desc:0 "Southern yeoman farmers and the agricultural workers of the nation as a whole have suffered mightily in recent years. We should work to subsidize and provide relief to this crucial group, and the national economy will prosper as a result of it." 
COR_increased_farmers_relief:0 "Further Relief for Farmers"
COR_increased_farmers_relief_desc:0 "Our programs have greatly benefited farmers thus far, and with the addition of school lunch programs for students, they will no longer be obligated to feed students on their own should they choose not to. This will allow them to sell more to the market and allow students more nutrition during the day."
COR_weaken_machines:0 "Weakening Party Machines"
COR_weaken_machines_desc:0 "The process of weakening Democratic party machines to re-attract ODP voters will take some time, but once we have succeeded in eliminating or at least weakening some of these organizations, we will enjoy increased support."

COR_rural_heritage_idea:0 "Rural Heritage"
COR_rural_heritage_idea_desc:0 "We have embraced our agricultural history, and this comes with many benefits. The only downside is that with more work to do on farms, some potential soldiers will be needed there more than on the front, and will take longer to train."

COR_nationalist_effort:0 "The Southern Bloc"
COR_nationalist_effort_desc:0 "With the South being brought closer to the rest of the nation, our country as a whole can prosper!"

COR_southern_fordists_idea_desc:0 "We have taken measures to combat the Northern Fordists who have been such a thorn in our side, but we had to replace them in some way. The best solution seems to be to prop up patriotic Southern Fordists while denouncing the rebellious Northern ones.

However, when the South revolted against the national government under William Murray's leadership, Russell, ever the clever politician, threw his lot in with the Constitutional American Republic. Now having achieved victory over his rivals, he seeks to use government aid to relieve the nation of it's economic woes, focusing on farmers especially. Only time will tell whether his efforts will be successful."
COR_southern_stimulus:0 "Southern Stimulus"
COR_southern_stimulus_desc:0 "Although he is a proponent of a balanced budget and generally a fiscal conservative, Russell believes the current economic crisis can only be ameliorated through government aid for farmers in the nation. His plans involve taking on the Boll Weevil crisis, granting farm loans, creating a system of old-age pensions, and instituting a new income tax to pay for these programs."
COR_tackle_corruption:0 "Tackle Corruption"
COR_tackle_corruption_desc:0 "Corruption was one of the main reasons the Democratic Party split in the first place. Now in power, Richard Russell hopes to take on this corruption directly and eliminate as much of it as he possibly can. At stake is the national budget and the future of this country. If we can eliminate the influence of the wealthy on our politics, perhaps we can begin to recover..."
COR_segregation_now:0 "Status Quo Jim Crow"
COR_segregation_now_desc:0 "The Jim Crow laws that have been in place for decades are here to stay. President Russell typically avoids the race question, but when he does address it, it is clear that he is a firm White supremacist who wishes to keep the status quo. However, his unwillingness to discuss the issue or even take some of the measures of Jim Crow further has caused tensions with the NDWL and some of the ODP."
COR_new_democrats:0 "New Democrats"
COR_new_democrats_desc:0 "Efforts to reunify the breakoff ODP with the Democratic Party should be undertaken to ensure we have enough support in the country to enact our policies. This will be no easy task; many of the Old Democrats left the party with complaints of corruption or weakness, and these qualities must be rooted out before they will be willing to rejoin. President Russell has already undertaken measures to this end, forcing the most corrupt officials to resign, but some stubbornly resist..."
COR_good_politics:0 "It's Only Good Politics..."
COR_good_politics_desc:0 "Eugene Talmadge has been a thorn in Richard Russell's side for years, and now the time has come to deal with him once and for all. He is now cut off from his main support system, and with evidence of his ties to wealthy Northeastern donors and Wall Street, we can end his career once and for all."
COR_agriculture_research:0 "Agricultural Research"
COR_agriculture_research_desc:0 "One of the most important programs for economic recovery will be investments in new agricultural tools and techniques. Such research can make farming more efficient, increase food production, and make life easier for struggling farmers. We should move forward with investment in such research."
COR_southern_electrification:0 "Southern Electrification Program"
COR_southern_electrification_desc:0 "Despite much of the nation having electricity, most of the South, especially rural areas, lags behind. Russell believes that without electricity, the South will have a tough time recovering from the Great Depression. The implementation of it in areas that currently lack the technology will also have many other important benefits, such as improving communication. It's time to modernize the South."
COR_infrastructure_programs:0 "National Highway System"
COR_infrastructure_programs_desc:0 "With the advent of the automobile, President Russell believes existing roadways should be connected in a National Highway System. Such highways will make it easier to travel between the distant urban areas of the South and generally connect the nation more than ever before."
COR_university_system_of_america:0 "University System of America"
COR_university_system_of_america_desc:0 "One of Richard Russell's largest priorities has been education. In an effort to centralize higher education in the country and make it more efficient, he has proposed the creation of a "University System of America". This system will emulate the University System of Georgia and have a similar Board of Regents who sets policy for the colleges on a nationwide basis and dispense funds to them as needed."
COR_smaller_government:0 "Efficient Governance"
COR_smaller_government_desc:0 "While Russell has expanded the size of the government to deal with the economic crisis, he is still a believer in a small, efficient national government. Such a government would give the states the breathing room they were always intended to have since the days of the Founding Fathers. While Russell does not wish to cut his new programs or government salaries, he believes he has ways of cutting out corruption and mismanagement that will make government ultimately more efficient."
COR_fiscal_responsability:0 "Fiscal Responsability"
COR_fiscal_responsability_desc:0 "Part of healing the nation's economy must be ensuring that rich and poor alike are responsible with their money. We will severely limit the ability of the elite to act out the same mistakes that caused the Great Depression, and we will ensure that the aid we send to the poor is used as intended. While these measures will not be perfect, we can ensure that money flows into the economy in the ways it is meant to, and not misused."
COR_balanced_budget:0 "A Balanced Budget"
COR_balanced_budget_desc:0 "A balanced budget is an important priority of the Russell Administration, and though the task seems daunting, Russell is determined to achieve it. To balance the budget, Russell proposes tax increases on the wealthy to create a surplus and then spending some of the surplus on aid to the poor, which will even the balance. Economists have deemed it a sound plan and it will move forward within the next few days."
COR_agrarian_heritage:0 "Agrarian Heritage"
COR_agrarian_heritage_desc:0 "America has always been a rural nation, but many have forgotten this fact in the past few decades. We should take measures to take care of our farmers, providing everything from loans to subsidies to tax cuts to ensure they have what they need to keep our nation fed. The American Farmer will be stronger than ever before!"
COR_states_rights:0 "States Rights"
COR_states_rights_desc:0 "One of the loudest calls of the ODP-and now the Democratic Party-is for state's rights. The Founding Fathers promised that the federal government would not act tyranically over the states, but that is exactly how it has acted in the past few years. Our people suffer under the weight of their government, and it is perhaps time to stop the federal government in its tracks and instead guarantee power to state governments."
COR_school_lunch_programs:0 "School Lunches For All"
COR_school_lunch_programs_desc:0 "The nation's children have been hit hard in the recent crises, and President Russell has a plan to grant them aid as well. The new "National School Lunch Act" will grant subsidies to schools to be used to provide low-cost or free lunches to all students. Giving students the option to eat lunch during the day will give them nourishment, help our farmers, and make us very popular with their parents."
COR_limit_immigration:0 "Crack Down on Immigration"
COR_limit_immigration_desc:0 "One of the greatest plights on our nation is immigration. Though we are a nation of immigrants, we should ensure newcomers come from the right places, lest we let in people who wish to destroy our way of life and replace it with their own. To guarantee this, we will enact harsher immigration laws for immigrants outside of Northern or Western Europe, so that we can better control the groups entering the country."
COR_wrestle_industrialists:0 "Outmaneuver the Industrialists"
COR_wrestle_industrialists_desc:0 "The industrialists have undermined our government at every turn, and it is time to put a stop to their treachery. Russell has enacted new laws severly limiting corporate power and the ability to form monopolies. Such a move will help to weaken the opposition, but it will also make us more popular with leftists, despite our distaste for unions. Our increased popularity will give us the ability to propagandize against uncooperative corporations, and this is just the way Russell wants it."
COR_deal_with_race_baitors:0 "Deal with Racebaiting"
COR_deal_with_race_baitors_desc:0 "It is time to decide on the implementation of a Liberia Plan with the help of Hiram Wesley Evans. Should we choose to adopt the plan, it will make us unpopular with other factions, but if we go back on our promises to Evans, it could cause a much bigger scene."
COR_nationalist_effort:0 "The Southern Bloc"
COR_nationalist_effort_desc:0 "The newly-formed Southern Bloc will be the most influential group in Congress, and it will advocate for Southern issues and beliefs in any way it can. The bloc will support measures that would benefit Southern states and vehemently oppose those that weaken or ignore them, and through this group, we will ensure the South is caught up to the rest of the nation."
COR_old_blood_and_guts:0 "Old Blood and Guts"
COR_old_blood_and_guts_desc:0 "George S. Patton has come to power in America. Known for his hard but down-to-earth approach to leadership, he now hopes to translate his experience to running the whole country. As such, he plans to put the country through a program not dissimilar to one his men would go through during training, in the hopes that this will put America on the right track. Only time will tell if  this will succeed, however."
COR_patton_speech:0 "Patton's Speech"
COR_patton_speech_desc:0 "Now that Patton has taken control, he has to solidify his position. His power over the military alone likely guarantees that he will remain in power, but the country will not be stable until he can find ways to appeal to the powerful political factions in the CAR; the Fordists, the NDWL and Klan, and even Old Democrats. Patton has decided to draft a speech to try and appeal to the American people, though his advisors beg him to make a targeted appeal to one group or another to help grow our base. The question is, which group should it be?"
COR_no_place_for_yellow_cowards:0 "Punish Cowards"
COR_no_place_for_yellow_cowards_desc:0 "We don't want yellow cowards in the army, and we sure as hell don't want them in our communinties. If we want to rebuild our country, we have to get rid of these maggots and get through this on good old American guts. We will only get there if we work as a team, and I don't care if he's a soldier, a worker, or a farmer; we all have a job to do. We cleaned up the enemy, now lets clean up the country!"
COR_white_crosses:0 "White Crosses"
COR_white_crosses_desc:0 "Almost every American knows someone who died in the Civil War. Though we disagreed with our opponents, they fought as heroically as our soldiers did, and for that they should be honored. Let us have memorials for all the Americans who perished, regardless of their allegiance. It's the right thing to do-and it will endear us to thousands of grieving families, perhaps even bringing them to our side." 
COR_visit_the_soldiers:0 "Visit the Soldiers"
COR_visit_the_soldiers_desc:0 "Despite George S. Patton's position as president, he greatly dislikes the politics of his office, and prefers to be with people, specifically his soldiers. As such, he has left many of the day-to-day decision making to his vice president and cabinet, while he travels across the country giving speeches to veterans from all sides of the Civil War. For their part, the soldiers are considerably excited when they learn of Patton's arrival, and his profanity-laden inspirational speeches have inspired men nationwide."
COR_separate_but_equal:0 "Separate but Equal"
COR_separate_but_equal_desc:0 "Now that the war is over and the country is under our control, one of the biggest questions facing our politicians (and Patton) is what to do about the racial and religious questions. Specifically, all sides of the CAR are pushing for action against Blacks and Jews, though what they believe should be done about the aforementioned groups varies depending on who we talk to. In any case, Patton's views on both generally differ from extremist groups, and he adheres to more mainstream Old Democratic Party stances. What should we do?"
COR_national_discipline:0 "National Discipline"
COR_national_discipline_desc:0 "George S. Patton emphasizes disicpline over all else in his men, but now he wishes to extend that to all Americans. Alcoholism, rape, adultery, and other offenses violate American culture and lead to decline. We should discourage these things, especially while we continue to rebuild the country, while also continuing to push Patton's programs of reconstruction, which are hard on workers but are becoming more normal every day." 
COR_new_tank_forces:0 "New Tank Forces"
COR_new_tank_forces_desc:0 "With the experience of the Civil War, it is clear that tanks are essential to modern warfare. We should build tank schools, train new tank crews, and build as many tanks as possible. The country with the largest tank force will have the world in its hand, Patton argues, and we should be first in that metric.Otherwise, we would risk falling behind and Patton will not allow that."
COR_kick_insurgents:0 "Kick Insurgents"
COR_kick_insurgents_desc:0 "Even though the Civil War is over, there are still resistance groups attempting to destabilize our fragile government. Other leaders might be worried by such developments, but Patton has been in high spirits, desperate to be in the field again. Though this sort of warfare is not as clear-cut as two armies clashing, Patton is insisting we move quickly so we can "kick them in the balls and go home". For his men, that is all they need to hear."
COR_the_slap_heard_nationwide:0 "The Slap Heard Nationwide"
COR_the_slap_heard_nationwide_desc:0 "Patton is known for his potential for anger, though this is perhaps an unfair characterization. Regardless, today, that exact scenario has occurred, and Patton has slapped someone! Other prominent ideological factions in government are deciding how to best respond with their own interests in mind. Though our citizens have mixed views on the event, we must act quickly to prevent new conflicts..."
COR_american_values:0 "American Values"
COR_american_values_desc:0 "George S. Patton was born in the West, and believes that the popularity of the Wild West in our culture is something to take notice of or even encourage. However, he also stresses the traditional American Protestant work ethic, noting that such ideas have been important since the nation's founding. Together, these two ideas will form the nucleus of a new, but still traditional, American culture that emphasizes courage, determination, and hard work."
COR_lessons_of_history:0 "Lessons of History"
COR_lessons_of_history_desc:0 "Patton, a student of history, scoffs at MacArthur's Caesar name, and has decided to come up with names of his own to poke fun at the man. He has variously called himself the American Hannibal, the American Scipio, the American Napoleon, and even the American Asskicker, in a speech to his men. Nicknames aside, Patton says he aims to learn the lessons from those times that still apply today, and implement them in a way that brings America's military closer to victory."
COR_restore_the_initiative:0 "Restore the Initiative"
COR_restore_the_initiative_desc:0 "Despite his distaste for politics, Patton has grown uneasy in recent weeks. In the wake of mounting reports of tensions between the ODP and its rival groups, it is clear that action will need to be taken if more bloodshed is to be avoided. Patton's worldview is typically unsuited to politics, but his desire for quick action may just save the nation from collapse..."
COR_reorganize_politics:0 "Reorganize Political Parties"
COR_reorganize_politics_desc:0 "Not a man to care much about parties or political identities, Patton has agreed to proposals his advisors have put forward to reorganize the old Republican and Democratic parties. To do so, his advisors will recruit prominent Democrats and either have them serve as heads of the new Democratic Party or switch over to the Republican Party and rebuild it from scratch. Whatever they do, Patton warns, he will not cowards in his government."
COR_unbroken_spirit:0 "Unbroken Spirit"
COR_unbroken_spirit_desc:0 "Patton's America has emerged from the chaos of the 1930's bruised and wounded, but with an unbroken spirit. The president's tough programs for rebuilding the country are beginning to pay off, as Americans adjust to Patton's demanding leadership style and adapt remarkably well, and it won't be long before the country has fully recovered. Patton, for his part, looks to the horizon and wonders where God will take him next."
COR_jewish_segregation:0 "Jewish Segregation"
COR_jewish_segregation_desc:0 "It's time to settle this Jewish question once and for all! Jews have long had too much influence in our nation and subvert our very culture, with many being supports of socialism. Jews will now be required to be registered with the government and may only live in approved areas. They will also pay a tax for the privilege of living in our nation."

COR_democrats_education:0 "Old Democrat Schooling"
COR_democrats_education_desc:0 "The children of America need access to a proper education lead by the Old Democrats. We will expand rural schools alongside an emphasis on American values, patriotism, the ODP's defense of America from integration and socialism and the various evils of big business, Longism and Marxism. All teachers will be expected to register with the ODP if they desire advancement."
COR_work_with_natives:0 "Native Alliances"
COR_work_with_natives_desc:0 "Many Native American tribes are as tired of the federal government's policies towards them as we are, with many even being penalized for siding with the Confederacy in the First American Civil War. We will close ranks with those tribes whom are most willing to ally with us against our enemies in return for higher autonomy, especially in Oklahoma."

COR_the_lone_eagle_desc:0 "The National Corporatist and Fordist wing of the Old Democratic Party has arisen victorious!

COR_the_american_legion:0 "The American Legion"
COR_the_american_legion_desc:0 "The end of the Republic would have ended in disaster if not for the brave veterans of the American Legion. It was the American Legion under Moseley that stood tall when public hysteria grew against syndicalists. It was also the American Legion that stood firm with Lindbergh and Ford when they fairly won the leadership of the Old Democrats."
COR_the_order_of_76:0 "The Order of 76"
COR_the_order_of_76_desc:0 "Nothing secures our position more than loyal patriots and our paramilitary allies in the Order of 76 are just that. Espousing pro-nationalist views a combatting not only syndicalists but those sillier Old Democrats whom admire a purer agrarianism over the Fordist program we will need to provide them funding and encourage defections from various White Leagues into it."
COR_use_the_fbi:0 "Use the Pinkertons"
COR_use_the_fbi_desc:0 "Patriotic corporations still need our aid from saboteurs and it would be foolish to not use one of the most skilled detective agencies in the United States; the Pinkertons. After contracing their services any company that is an ally of the state will be loaned Pinkertons when threatened by radicalism and their detectives will work to investigate enemies of our Republic."
COR_alien_and_sedition_act:0 "New Alien and Sedition Acts"
COR_alien_and_sedition_act_desc:0 "One of the most important acts of the early American Republic was the Aliens and Sedition Act passed by President John Adams, a wise statesman. We must revive the Act to protect true Americans from syndicalist infiltrators. Firstly, being a danger to public safety or national integrity is now grounds for imprisonment and deportation."
COR_national_corporatism:0 "Protestant Corporatism"
COR_national_corporatism_desc:0 "Every productive group within this nation is a great cog contributing to the machine that is the American Economy. It is time to formalize them with a preference for White Protestants, organizing workers and managers by their profession and giving each of them representation in government so that they may have a voice with the central government."
COR_cointelpro:0 "COINTELPRO"
COR_cointelpro_desc:0 "The success of the New Aliens and Sedition Act has allowed us to identify several non-political and religious organizations with known syndicalist members.

COR_purge_dissidents:0 "Purge Dissidents"
COR_purge_dissidents_desc:0 "Through the Aliens and Sedition Act we have gathered a list of known enemies of the War Powers Committee.

COR_office_of_policy_coordination:0 "Office of Policy Coordination"
COR_office_of_policy_coordination_desc:0 "The Office of Policy Coordination, or OPC, was proposed as a means to influence local politics in our favor through agent provocateurs, small scale sanctions, and direct sabotage.

COR_the_black_chamber:0 "The Black Chamber"
COR_the_black_chamber_desc:0 "Another safety objective is to revitalize the Black Chamber with something Vannevar Bush calls Memex. It is a hypothetical system that would be able to store and transmit microfilm and make information search-able from a station that is connected through telephone wire to other stations. This proposed plan could lead us to a golden age of security."
COR_nationalist_restoration:0 "Nationalist Restoration"
COR_nationalist_restoration_desc:0 "Americans have not felt patriotic towards their old nation in a long time. This will change with the advent of our new nation.

COR_embrace_wild_west:0 "Embrace the Wild West"
COR_embrace_wild_west_desc:0 "The South shares a lot of characteristics with the stereotypical 'Wild West'. We should seek to take these similarities from the Hollywood world and extend them to our world. Certain parts of our message have appeal out West, sometimes even more so than they do in the South. More importantly, a gradual advance West will help us eliminate remaining Longist dissidents who block our way to the Pacific."
COR_odp_spreads:0 "The ODP Grows"
COR_odp_spreads_desc:0 "If we want to control the country, the Old Democratic Party will need to expand its base outside of the South. One area that is ripe for expansion is the old Federalist territory. Our kin in Virginia will be quick to embrace the ODP, and now that we control Washington, we can grow there as well, destroying Federalist rebels once and for all."
COR_traitorous_reds:0 "Traitorous Reds"
COR_traitorous_reds_desc:0 "Before the War, Murray warned about the traitorous Reds that he believed would try to ruin the nation and all we held dear.

As for the people, well, we have something for them too..."
COR_fight_miscegenation:0 "Fight Miscegenation"
COR_fight_miscegenation_desc:0 "We observed firsthand what happens to a politically-divided nation during the Civil War. That was a tragedy we do not wish to repeat. By ensuring separation on racial lines instead, we will ensure the country is united, and keep our heritage while we are at it."
COR_small_businesses:0 "Small Town America"
COR_small_businesses_desc:0 "When Bill Murray railed against corporations, he was not talking about business or enterprise.

COR_american_nationalism:0 "American Nationalism"
COR_american_nationalism_desc:0 "The American Dream, or Creed, or even Ideal is the often-described glue that holds together our national integrity and prevents civil disturbances.

COR_fordism_desc:0 "Although scientific management was not invented by Henry Ford, it was Ford that proved that measuring time spent on work tasks could lead to faster and more efficient time management.

COR_capitalist_education:0 "Create the ESMWT"
COR_capitalist_education_desc:0 "The Engineering, Science, and Management War Training, or ESMWT, is the brainchild of the Department of Commerce to decentralize technological changes.

COR_captains_of_industry:0 "Captains of Industry"
COR_captains_of_industry_desc:0 "Without the noble self-sacrifice of the Captains of Industry, America would have been lost.

With many exceptions designed to give these useful industrialists tax breaks if they are engaged in philanthropy."
COR_industrial_security_act:0 "Industrial Security Act"
COR_industrial_security_act_desc:0 "The need for work-site security has never been greater.

COR_disband_klan:0 "Disband the Klan"
COR_disband_klan_desc:0 "While we believe the Klan stands for agreeable values its vigilante nature and autonomy can make it a problem, especially when some reject Lindbergh and Ford for being 'yankees'.

COR_citizen_monitors:0 "Citizen Monitors"
COR_citizen_monitors_desc:0 "Many former Klan members are still disgruntled at our decision to disband the KKK despite attempts to appease the members.

COR_traditional_values:0 "Traditional Values"
COR_traditional_values_desc:0 "An address by President [COR.GetLeader] has denounced the changes of the last thirty years as the agenda of foreigners that sought to destroy America's industrious nature.

Forced labor for traitors at the service of the corporation that is the Commonwealth."

COR_white_welfare_desc:0 "First order is to determine who is a true natural citizen and deserving of aid in our nation.

COR_black_laws:0 "Black Laws"
COR_black_laws_desc:0 "The Jim Crow laws are a good start but fail to go far enough to stop black America from overthrowing the White Man from his rightful place in history. No longer will they purchase property outside their own cities, hold jobs on par with a white professional or be represented by a public defenders whom are supposed to represent WHITE America. The wrongs of the past will be righted."

COR_christian_work_ethic:0 "Christian Work Ethic"
COR_christian_work_ethic_desc:0 "With the advent of our knew nation, there begins a split in work ethic across the nation that the Old Democrat radicals did not intend.

COR_defending_the_white_race:0 "Defending the White Race"
COR_defending_the_white_race_desc:0 "With all the recent laws we have passed, we should prepare for a backlash. It would not do to have our women and children attacked by savages.

COR_legacy_of_the_know_nothings_desc:0 "The Know-Nothings were cruelly repressed by the Northern Political Bosses despite them merely desiring to defend native whites from immigrant hordes.

COR_american_emperor_desc:0 "It is time for the various Old Democrats to stop fussing around and recognize that the head of the National Democratic White League is the chief executive of the United States.

The President and American Emperor of the Invisible Empire shall also be gifted total say on all legal matters."

COR_deal_with_catholics_desc:0 "The Unitarians and Catholics still hold many views unbecoming of a patriot but they may keep the churches so long as they do not donate to or endorse liberal causes and allow Klansmen into their pews, alongside obeying existing conformations. This will make it easier to cultivate ties with right-wing catholics in the New England area to combat socialist influence while expanding our own."
COR_destroy_the_legion:0 "Destroy the Legion"
COR_destroy_the_legion_desc:0 "While many admire the Black Legion and its closest allies for going to the extreme to defend Whiteness they have simply become uncontrollable alongside having already attempted to subjugate the Young Klan.

COR_citzens_council:0 "White Citizens Councils"
COR_citzens_council_desc:0 "The legacy of civil disobedience that shook the 1930s has stayed with the members of the White Citizens Council. The White Citizens Council has taken up the torch to discourage citizens from supporting integration while allowing a meeting place for whites to decide local policies that do not go against Klan doctrine. We should provide them with further tax exemptions."
COR_true_corporatism:0 "True Corporatism"
COR_true_corporatism_desc:0 "We must set the economy on a path that is both functional and patriotic.

COR_klan_education:0 "Klan Education"
COR_klan_education_desc:0 "Our children must learn true American values as well as about historical criminals whom attempted to undue our nation such as MacArthur, Grant and Lincoln.

COR_family_programs:0 "Family Programs"
COR_family_programs_desc:0 "The failure of the Old Klan was to consider the KKK merely a militia society when it is a societal for the white race. However, that can only be true if the Klan sees a massive expansion in membership among native American Protestants. The organization will expand its Child League, host celebrations ranging from the small to the large and provide family benefits to dues-paying members."
COR_Klan_Marshals:0 "Marshals of the Red Shirt"
COR_Klan_Marshals_desc:0 "The Klan has seen expansion but nonetheless suffers each chapter having a bit too much autonomy. This breeds leadership crises' and the habits of the Klan changing by region making it look arbitrary at times, being either too soft or harsh in such a way as to lose public support.

COR_cooperation_from_afar:0 "Cooperation from Afar"
COR_cooperation_from_afar_desc:0 "With the American Black population increasingly residing in Liberia we could follow the suggestions of some nationalists on both sides of the aisle and improve relations with the state for both their resources and a shared front against syndicalism and integration. In return they would undoubtedly want something from us but a nominal ally would be useful as we are short on them."
COR_american_exodus:0 "American Exodus"
COR_american_exodus_desc:0 "Minorities are fleeing the United States with our Presidents announcement proclaiming the Fraternity of America. Most of our members are quite happy with this although some believe they are leaving too slowly.

COR_klan_cinema:0 "Klan Cinema"
COR_klan_cinema_desc:0 "While in the 1920's Hollywood promoted much filth that has since been banned, it also created some of our greatest pictures such as D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation.

COR_united_against_syndicalism_desc:0 "A new campaign against syndicalism and reminder of the dangers it poses and the domestic enemies to the state they are associated with will spur unity and recruitment among the population, as well as loyalty among the some of those who are still skeptical of the NDWL."

COR_alma_white_desc:0 "White Protestanism not only advances the interest of the white man but of the white women as well.

COR_the_protocals_of_zion_desc:0 "With our variant of protestant Christianity seeing a further expansion among female white supremacists it is time to stomp out the next-greatest threat to our political power, the Christian Identitarians. Their influence in the White League is troubling as is their loyalty to non-Klan figures. We shall use their tales of being the 'true Jews' to great effect by spreading the Protocals of Zion with an updated preface describing the Elders of Zion desire to align themselves with those values. A stretch yes, but one that may save us and America."
COR_fund_racial_sciences:0 "Fund Racial Sciences"
COR_fund_racial_sciences_desc:0 "If Klan views are to seem legitimate it needs not only political backing, but scientific backing as well.

COR_the_black_legion:0 "The Black Legion"
COR_the_black_legion_desc:0 "Undoubtedly our most valuable and powerful allies, the Black Legion has the will to do what even other Old Democrats won't.

When this group was docile, there were no racial tensions in America, but now, their continuous march for inclusion into American life has driven a wedge into the nation.

This last title holder, Smedley Butler, had foolishly sided with the syndicalists. Whomever taken this position will symbolically represent the veterans of the United States military in society, and thus our choice is important. A common name floated up is General George Moseley, though his alliance with national corporatists makes him somewhat controversial among others. Of course a more popular choice is George Patton himself despite not being terribly diplomatic. Some NDWL members dispute both of these choices and claim their man Wickliffe Draper has earned the position. Who shall be appointed?"

Exiled from Detroit he has been using his foreign and local factories to supply us with needed goods but he now offers us far more. He would like us to allow him control of major control of our industries so that he may organize and upgrade them along Fordist lines. Obviously this would make him one of the most powerful men in our Republic but it may be needed for the war effort. Fordist supporters such as George Von Moseley, Charles Lindbergh and Vance Muse are supportive of the effort although the White Leagues are less-so, believing him to not be loyal to the Klan cause and too elitist to serve the cause."

constate.4.t:0 "White Leagues ask us to stop Ford"
constate.4.d:0 "Ford has been distributing his ideology to all of his "workers", which extends to all industries he's in charge of managing. This includes agreeable literature such the Protocols of the Elders of Zion and pamphlets on clean living but also encouraging workers and managers to join the Order of 76 or if a veteran the American Legion. It doesn't help that the original wing of the Order of the 76 suffered a schism and in protest of Clare Hoffman's growing influence its leader Royal S. Gulden joined the Silver Shirts, a movement that now aligns itself with Huey Long! Their growth comes at the expense of the National Democratic While League, especially as the Order of 76 forbids membership into Christian Identity groups run by the Elders of Zion and discourages dual Klan membership. Should we reduce his influence by demoting him the risk of angering national corporatists and throwing our military economy in temporary chaos?"

George Von Moseley has increased control of the military at the expense of traditional Old Democrat General Patton while Vance Muse and Henry Ford are edging out Carter Glass on the economy and Charles Lindbergh is becoming a popular face across our territory. As such Charles Lindbergh and Clare Hoffman (representing the Order), have decided to visit Alfalfa Bill and over dinner discuss making several concessions that would allow Lindbergh to become the new head of state. Alfalfa Bill is well aware of how the game is played but he remains aware they still need his backing to come to power so while Murray had expected something along these lines occurring he was nonetheless entertained at his guests obvious desperation to have him accept. Well aware he could set up a deal for himself while gaining needed industrial support for the cause, Murray wondered if they would be willing to subsidize small farmers, to appoint him lifelong governor of Oklahoma and have him appointed to a symbolic rank that was technically above them. With them agreeing Murray now had a choice between accepting or turning them down regardless, well aware them being upset would damage the war effort but also being ambivalent about carpetbagger industrialists running the nation, albeit ones with agreeable ideas and whom payed respect to agrarianism."

He has appointed Charles Lindbergh as the new National Leader of the Old Democratic Party. Initially Lindbergh evokes mixed feelings from some of the populace due to his own heritage as northern 'Elitist' but others feel he is a better unifying figure for America than Murray would be and more importantly can rally more the nation. As a result Northern Old Democrats are more encouraged than Southern loyalists by his appointment... at least until the party papers can work their magic. In the meantime the NDWL has mixed-to-negative feelings on the issue, dampening their support of the war effort."

constate.600.t:0 "Whispers of a Murray Retirement"
constate.600.d:0 "For years, Alfalfa Bill Murray has led the country through some of its most trying times, but now rumors abound of his deteriorating physical state. While Murray could easily live for many more years, the stress of holding the country together has clearly had an impact on the man. Some are beginning to openly wonder about a successor to Murray, though all suggested candidates are members of the ODP elite in one way or another. The hardliners in the party wish to see Eugene Talmadge, the Georgia firebrand, at the head of the ODP. His allegiance to Murray and the ODP is without question, but some question whether he can handle the economy or foreign policy given his overt focus on racial policies. The more liberally-minded candidate, Strom Thurmond, is a masterful politican, but far younger and less experienced than Talmadge. If he were to succeed Murray, the hardliners in the party as well as those outside the party might protest that Thurmond does not adequately live up to the ideals of the state Murray founded only a few short years ago. Hidden among these two giants is Murray's lieutenant, John E. Rankin. Rankin, a quiet elderly statesman with years of experience, would be the safe choice, but many have openly wondered whether Rankin has the strengh of personality to hold the fractured nation together. Regardless of these choices, the choice of retirement is ultimately up to Murray, and if he wishes to stay in power, there are few that would oppose him..."

While his status as a Democrat is alarming to some, he is extremely similar to Murray in policy terms, and has promised to continue Murray's vision for America. This is a promise that has garnered him significant support from the ODP, especially from their Georgia members. His ascension to power does not come without challenge however; his largest detractor appears to be Eugene Talmadge, one of the most powerful Old Democrats and a personal rival to Russell. For Russell to keep power for any meaningful amount of time, he will need to act quickly to ease the concerns of the ODP. He will be able to fend off the Fordists or the NDWL if he has the support of most of the ODP, but outmaneuvering Talmadge will take everything Russell has. However, Russell has always been a better politician than Talmadge, and Talmadge has made many enemies with his fiery personality. Meanwhile, Russell has good relationships with many of these same politicians, and he could call in some favors. It will not be an easy task however..."

constate.602.t:0 "A Done Deal?"
constate.602.d:0 "By putting Richard Russell in charge, William Murray has undoubtedly shown his intentions for an alliance with the Western faction, even though he was forced out of power for advocating it. Richard Russell, ever the clever political actor, has refrained from using language about a direct alliance. Instead, he has advocated a mere neutrality pact between the two, with a solution to be determined at the end of the war. Since the Pacific States are run by Democrats that agree with Russell on many issues, it is difficult to accuse Russell of betraying his principles by allying with them. For now, the controversy around this deal has waned, but it will be replaced by other issues. Should we pass this deal?"

Of course, as we are still in a state of war neither side can escalate the conflict further without risking their own security. However many are calling this unacceptable and would us ask Order of 76 leader Clare Hoffman to investigate the White Leagues which could turn up more legitimate reasons to arrest or blackmail them, having our top man Harry Bennett aid him. However, this would be extremely risky and Lindbergh is calling for us to ignore them until the conflict is over."

constate.8.d:0 "An Order of 76 chapter leader named Joe McWilliams was killed by a car bomb today outside of his office! An active leader of the Order of 76 and one of our more prominent supporters, he was carrying out an order from Hoffman to undermine the White Leagues in favor of his preferred groups with more direct connections to the government. It is clear that despite us being at war for survival the White Leagues have decided to send us a message and end a potential internal threat to them. Perhaps we should back down until this war is over? Hardliners such as Hoffman want to arrest the heads of the NDWL and hold them hostage until the end of the war but others are cautioning this would be political (and perhaps literal) suicide as the NDWL commands mass loyalty. They instead think we should focus on controlling the economy via government contracts to edge out the NDWL and use their reluctance to move against us during war against them."

In fact, even William H. Murray when asked has stated that the new national leaders have gone back on their word and advocated replacing them. While technically having autocratic power and being impossible to remove without his resignation Lindbergh and his faction simply does not have enough internal support, and as par the course for the Constitutional American Republic other political machines are already working against him and Ford."

During a seemingly ordinary meeting at the headquarters of the Order of 76 in the capital Klansmen burst in with shotguns and pistols and killed several members and members of our government coordinating with them, including our own Clare Hoffman. Shortly afterwards Order of 76 members were openly hunted down and gunned down in the streets with some being strung up as examples. Lindbergh and Ford themselves were in a hideout while this occurred, which apparently the White League did not know until they had already raided the HQ. They have escaped the area and with it, left the country in the hands of the White League who are quickly focusing on the war effort instead."

constate.1000.d:0 "William Joseph Simmons, Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, has been chosen as a compromise candidate among the Democratic White League given his quasi-genial demeanor and (probably much more importantly) his nominal status of the largest white supremacist organization in the nation. In a speech to the nation Simmons declared a full-throated defense of "Americanism, protestant womanhood, and Christian morality", demanding that Old Democrats either stand with him or the NDWL. He likewise noted the White Leagues recent success in destroying traitors to the nation and declared his intent to spread that action to the rest of the country. With his ascent the Invisible Empire and its "allies" stretches further but most are well aware that he does not have the unity he would desire in the Democratic White League, undermining his own position for the present moment which his more ambitious followers are absolutely enthused with. The military staff on the hand is simply happy that the internal political debates have"

His advisors were not sure of what to do, as Simmons had ordered them not to tell any other underlings. Eventually, they had a doctor from the nearest town come to Simmons' aid. By the time he arrived, Simmons' condition had deteriorated enough that a lack of oxygen to his brain placed him in a coma. Meanwhile, insiders of each major faction of the White League had clearly given away what happened to their leader as D.C. Stephenson entered the room wailing, wondering how the American Emperor could pass in his prime only to discover that Simmons was still breathing, to his obvious surprise. While Stephenson was dismissing the staff, Hiram Wesley Evans showed up to the scene and a tense standoff ensured as each wondered what to do. Evans went to contact his Klan connections in the South and the military, while D.C. Stephenson left to alert his Old Klan allies. Finally, Christian Identity leader and fellow NDWL leader Herbert W. Armstrong entered the building, offering to pray for Simmons but neither Stephenson nor Evans were interested in giving the Black Sheep of the NDWL full access to the American Emperor. With all three major players now here, no one is certain that what follows will be peaceful, least of all General Patton, whom was forced to watch all of this."

He takes time to discuss Douglas MacArthur, explaining that MacArthur's vanity made him more of a "sissy" than someone who could fight for America. Furthermore, Patton lambasts him for his actions during the Bonus Army incident, and argues that fighting him was necessary to preserve America. On Butler and the CSA, Patton has surprisingly little, though he points to former President Herbert Hoover's easing of restrictions on unions as partly to blame for the chaos that ensued after. While never explicitly stated, most of Patton's advisors believe he ommitted any mention of the AUS out of respect for his friend, Connor Fox, although there is a strange comment about putting a kingfish wallmount in his quarters. Most of all, Patton's speech focuses on the veterans of the Civil War, calling them heroes for their efforts in saving America. However, he also cautions that now is not the time to be a "yellow coward", and that keeping order and rebuilding America will be a team effort. There will be those who get in the way, but Patton urges his men to "hold them by the balls and kick them in the ass". The speech is fairly mild for Patton, and while he won't let his advisors edit it, he may be open to making it longer. We should make sure he makes a political message as well, but who should it appeal to?"

constate.1102.d:0 "The time has come for Patton to decide how to handle the racial question. Old Democrats generally support the status quo of Jim Crow, while more extremist factions would like to see further discrimination against Blacks. Patton agrees with neither, however. While he has always been a vocal racist, Patton witnessed the prowess of Black soldiers during the Civil War. He does not believe that they are equal to Whites, but he does argue that it would be foolish to not utilize them in our military. Given the losses American sustained in the war, men are men, and we need all the help we can get, he argues. What should we do?"

George Lincoln Rockwell, a rising figure in the Klan whose youth may have made him overly bold, interrupted Patton and called him a sellout to Blacks for wanting to allow them into the military. Patton ignored this comment and kept speaking. However, when Rockwell then insinuated that Patton would let a Black veteran sleep with his daughter, the older man lost his cool and slapped Rockwell across his face. The Klan leaders stormed out of the meeting and the news has spread like wildfire, with stories written nationwide about the confrontation. It seems this outburst has guaranteed the failure of diplomacy between the two groups, and now the country anxiously looks to see what the Klan's next move will be."

With the President seen as more sympathetic to the Ku Klux Klan than the more northern Fordists, tensions were already high in the meeting, but relations soon soured even more. Lindbergh, whose actions during the Civil War and support from the business community have made him very influential, wondered aloud whether Patton would be a Canadian puppet. Patton ignored this comment and kept speaking. However, when Lindbergh then proclaimed that Patton loved Anglo-Saxons so much that he would gladly side with British syndicalists over Germany, the older man lost his cool and slapped Lindbergh across his face. Fordist leaders stormed out of the meeting and the news has spread like wildfire, with stories written nationwide about the confrontation. It seems this outburst has guaranteed the failure of diplomacy between the two groups, and now the country anxiously looks to see what Lindbergh's next move will be."

However, when he found a soldier who appeared to not be hurt at all, he strolled over to the man and asked what was wrong. The man replied that he "just didn't feel good" and that the "stress of war" had gotten to him. A fuming Patton slapped the man across his face and reprimanded him for his cowardice, calling him a yellow coward and threatening him. At one point, Patton even threatened to stand the man against the wall and have him killed via firing squad, or to kill him himself to save time. Luckily, hospital commander Donald E. Currier intervened between the two and prevented further violence. Patton's actions have received mixed reactions among the public, though Fordists and the NDWL see Patton as a potentially unstable leader, and are said to be planning to replace him, privately stating that he has done nothing for them anyawys.

However, the party could be redeemed under new leadership and a revitalized structure. Patton is open to allowing the party to exist once more, but insists that it is led by loyal politicians who will not be susceptible to the same corruption as previous Democratic Party bosses. The main candidates to lead the new party are Harry F. Byrd, who would lead its conservative wing, and James F. Byrnes, who while quite conservative himself could lead a liberal wing more in favor of government intervention. However, restoring the party may be unpopular with some of our people, and we could instead decide to leave the party in its grave. What should we do?"

Patton is open to allowing the party to exist once more, but insists that it is led by loyal politicians who will not be strongly opposed to his main ideas for how American should be run. The main candidates to lead the new party are Storm Thurmond, who would lead its conservative, business oriented wing, and Joseph McCarthy, who while quite business-friendly himself could lead a liberal wing more in favor of somewhat liberal social policies. Such policies would only be considered liberal by our standards, but it would still provide an option for former Republicans. However, restoring the party may be unpopular with some of our people, and we could instead decide to leave the party in its grave. What should we do?"

constate.1107.d:0 "George S. Patton has a quite a dilemma facing him: he doesn't want to lead the country. While Patton believes his ideas are best for the recovery of America, he has always preferred to leave politics to politicians, seeing both as distasteful. Now though, he has the important task of choosing the man who will essentially run the day to day operations of his government and make political decisions, even if Patton has the final say on them. Patton has two men in particular in mind for the job: John Elliott Rankin and James Francis Byrnes. Rankin was a loyal supporter of Murray, but appointing him may make it seem like we are shutting out non-ODP members of our government. A darkhorse option would be James F. Byrnes, the powerful South Carolina politician who, although more moderate than many of our politicians, could not be said to a candidate favoring one faction or another. Other proposals have reached Patton's desk, ranging from Fordists to the most extreme portions of the NDWL, but he has declined to endorse any of these, noting that they would be too far in one direction or another to effectively govern the country. Who should the vice president be?"

The Fordists have strongholds in the North, particularly Illinois, and if these can be raided and searched for weapons, plans, and other traitorous materials, we can expose them to the American public and bring them to justice.

constate.1109.d:0 "The influence of the South has been very strong in America since the end of the Civil War. However, Patton and his advisors control much more land than what they started with, and as such, some are saying that we need to change how we appeal to our wider constituency. Patton, always one to think and act decisively, quickly put forward the ideas of Cowboys and the "Wild West'' as possibily appealing to all Americans, as such things had been staples of American culture for decades. Even foreigners have begun to stereotype Americans as Cowboys, and the image fits with Patton's view of how America should be as well. The rough, tough, but ultimately lawful attitude is exactly what he sees as the American way of life, and he is eager for this to be true once again. Being a California native himself, and spending much of his time in the West, Patton believes that this appeal will be successful in giving them the support they need-and perhaps have the side effect of weakening the Klan and the Fordists as well."

constate.1110.d:0 "As part of his job as president, Patton has taken it upon himself to visit foreign leaders and diplomats and try to find allies for the new America. One of the more bizarre regions he has visited is Morocco, where he arranged meetings with Sultan Mohammed V. The two got along surprisingly well, despite the fact that the Sultan could not technically speak a language besides Arabic to him in public. In private, Patton learned that the man spoke a variety of European languages, including English, and the two developed a friendship. Patton complimented the Sultan on the beautiful architecture of the country, which he described as the best he had ever seen, and the two men shared several meals and ceremonies before Patton left for America. Even if Mohammed V does not have as much power as he would want Patton to believe, he does have influence over the Moroccan people, and Patton hopes that the meeting will someday blossom into closer relations between the two countries."

However, he quickly learned he was in over his head as Patton kneed the man between his legs and subdued him until the Secret Service arrived and whisked the attacker away. Patton dusted himself off and, after proclaiming to the crowd that the man had "plenty of guts but no brains", continued his speech. It appears the attack has made Patton even more popular, and the attacker himself is awaiting a trial."

Russell is inclined to support another Democrat for the position, and two men have come to mind. James Francis Byrnes, the influential Senator of South Carolina, has proven himself to be a brilliant politician and a skilled negotiator, and his talent could be useful to calm tensions within the nation. Another South Carolina politician, Strom Thurmond, is young and inexperienced, but his service in the Army, strong support for Russell, and political talent make him a good candidate as well. Part of Russell's decision should revolve around whether he wants to pick an experienced partner or a potential successor. Who should we choose?"

constate.1113.t:0 "Eliminating Corruption in Government"
constate.1113.d:0 "Richard Russell has always desired to balance the budget, and in his eyes, the best way to do so would be to levy new income taxes on the wealthy and remove some of the influence of party machines. On face value, it seems these measures would be popular with farmers and other poor Southerners, who would benefit from a more representative and responsible government. It is true that the Old Democrats, and with them, most Southerners, have supported Russell's measures to combat corruption. Its is worth noting that the ODP has pressed him to focus more on his own Democratic Party, which they claim is more established and thus has more entrenched corruption. Russell has been open to such proposals, though it seems his loyalty to the Democratic Party is unshakable. While Southern citizens, living in a largely rural society, have taken a liking to Russell's anti-corruption measures, it seems that our Northern citiziens see his measures quite differently..."

Chief among them are the Fordists, who are protesting what they see as a tyrannical attack on industry and enterprise. Any attempts to soothe angry politicians and business leaders have failed, and are often met with accusations that Richard Russell is a syndicalist or at least a useful idiot for the Northern left-wing radicals. Russell has responded by saying that "a Fordist-led government in the Great Depression would be content to stand by and handcuff the government while citizens starve without being able to lend them any assistance." It seems clear that, while combating the wealthy's corrupting influence on politics is popular, Russell will not be able to count on the Fordists in the future for funds or support..."

The NDWL and Ku Klux Klan have made it clear that they want Russells to go much farther in his proposals, yet they seem to disagree on what exactly should be done. For now, Russell and his advisors are content to let them squabble amongst themselves, since they pose little threat. A man who does pose a threat, however, is the powerful ODP politician Eugene Talmadge. Talmadge, who Russell once considered the only man who could challenge his power in Georgia, now threatens him on a national level, despite Russell's victory over the man in the 1936 Georgia Senate Election. In fiery speeches across the South, Talmadge has accused Russell of being a syndicalist sympathizer, and argues that his policies are specifically meant to benefit Blacks. Violence is common at these events, with Russell loyalists brawling with Talmadge's supporters. Russell has not hesitated to respond to Talmadge's accusations, stating that "they are an example of what any Southern politician does as a last resort: cry nigger."  He has also noted that Talmadge has ties to Northeastern Republicans, and has questioned why he is fighting with the Constitutional American Republic at all, saying he would be better suited to life in New England. While Russell is a shrewd politician, it is clear that he will not be getting rid of Talmadge anytime soon."

Talmadge, while a fiery and charismatic speaker, has not been able to garner the support Murray was able to among Southerners, and he is vulnerable. By granting further economic stimulus to farmers and ensuring they are our top priority, we will show them that we are on their side, and likely pull most of them over to our side. After all, Russell's advisors argue, economics appeals will be more appealing than racial ones. Still, there is a case for playing Talmadge's game and engaging in racial issues. We may be able to steal support from moderate ODP members this way and make our supporters more radical, though our advisors warn that buying into Talmadge's framework could be dangerous, and Russell is uncomfortable with discussion around such issues. What should we do?"

Talmadge has not been able to consolidate control in a way that Murray was able to, and he has many enemies within the party. His most prominent rival is Walter F. Bossert, an Indiana politician who is ostensibly a member of the ODP but has secret ties to the NDWL. Such ties are no secret to Russell, though, and supporting a Bossert-takeover of the party would both get rid of Talmadge and satisfy the Ku Klux Klan. Even better, it would de-legitimize the ODP, and drive members who dislike the NDWL into our waiting arms. However, if we want to support Democratic Party interests alone, we could promise to give cabinet positions to some members of the ODP, provided they are loyal to us in the long run. These cabinet members would slowly undermine and eventually replace Talmadge using their newfound power and this would also get rid of him. Which plan should we adopt?"

To bring these voters back into the fold, it was clear to President Russell that such corruption would have to be eliminated. In the past month, we have captured many politicians who were engaging in money laundering, arrested those who have tried to suppress the poor White vote, and locked up those who have siphoned our stimulus money to their own pockets. It seems these activities have not gone unnoticed, and ODP voters are starting to regain confidence in the Democratic Party. Our popularity has soared, and it seems our government is more efficient as well now, with the worst of the corruption being eliminated. It is a new day for the party of Andrew Jackson."

constate.1119.d:0 "The term "states' rights" has traditionally been used in the context of the American South. However, before the Civil War began, there was a Republican plan to extend autonomy on a national level, called the "Home Rule Plan". At the time, the plan was meant to give autonomy to rebellious regions and prevent them from rebelling, and although our goals are slightly different, we could adapt this plan for our own purposes. Their plan limited their control over the country, but ours would increase liberty in the states it impacts. Of course, we could also maintain the traditional meaning of the phrase, and tie the meaning to segregation. If we choose the national plan, it will increase our popularity with Syndicalists, Longists, and other groups, while the local plan will give us support among Southerners. What should we do?"

However, it is clear that we must take more action to fully handle this threat. There are two potential plans that each have their own benefits. The first would be to champion Southern Fordists, who are the most sympathetic to our cause. In doing so, we can portray the Northern industrialists as traitors, but the Southern industrialists alone will be a poor replacement for their counterparts in the North. It will take some time for them to give us the same benefits as the Northern ones had, but they assure us that they are willing to take up the mantle of production. The other possibility would be to arrest Henry Ford, who has been the primary agitator against President Russell, and hope that that silences the group. While this would certainly deal the Fordists a heavy blow, we must be careful to not be seen as tyrants, and our next move will have to be careful. Which plan should we follow?"
constate.1120.d.aggressive:0 "It seems that Fordists across the spectrum are upset with our recent anti-corruption measures, with many accusing us of syndicalist motivations rather than a motivation to fight corruption. Even worse, we have heard reports of Fordists covertly rallying support for a coup, though Russell has dismissed the idea, not believing that they would be so bold or even have the support for a coup if they were that bold. However, the NDWL is nowhere to be seen, and the ODP has been strangely quiet, leaving some to wonder what their motivations are. It seems our administration may be in trouble..."

Russell's advisors note that with the support of Southern Fordists, we could also reach out to moderate Northern ones, and perhaps even fully restore our industrial might this way. However, if we chose to arrest Henry Ford instead, it may be best to try and court Charles Lindbergh. Lindbergh may be a Fordist, but his pride and ambition make him susceptible to promises of power, and we should give him such guarantees in exchange for his support. Such a deal would likely bring most Fordists to our side, with only the most radical ones still revolting against us. Of course, negotiating with Lindbergh would be a delicate affair, and some advisors say it would be easier to simply arrest him. This may cause more trouble, though."

Instead of Riley, we could bring in James O. Eastland, who agrees with Russell on the principle of a balanced budget.

We could send Talmadge to New England to be with his weatlhy donors, or we could arrest him. Sending him to New England will be a popular if not humorous choice, though it would leave him able to return at some point.

William Joseph Simmons has been able to keep the faction unified for now, but the lines of the Old Klan, the Young Klan, and Herbert Armstrong's factions are clear within the group. Tensions have risen for years, and it is clear to any observer that they will erupt soon; it is only a matter of time. Anticipating this and predicting an eventual unification behind one faction, Russell has decided it would be prudent to play kingmaker behind the scenes. In pursuit of this, he has called a meeting with Young Klan leader Hiram Wesley Evans, who was happy to meet with the president despite his reservations about his administration. While Russell has never closely associated with the Ku Klux Klan, he and Evans agree on many issues, particularly on a potential plan to send at least some Blacks back to Africa. The two will meet and discuss policy, life, and most importantly, how Russell can be of assistance to Evans in his bid for leadership of the NDWL. Russell, seeing the Young Klan as the least radical of the three factions, sees this as the best outcome, and should decide how he can help Evans before the meeting."

The remaining Fordists have protested that such a move would weaken corporations and deprive them of a source of cheap labor, the ODP disagrees with the idea of deportation, and factions outside the South believe the idea to be too extreme.

This means that we have no ability to shape the debate around this conflict. However, one thing we can influence is the discourse around the First Civil War. Outside of the South, the Confederacy is seen as noble perhaps, yet still wrong, and we should distance ourselves from such a narrative. Already there are many in the original Constitutional American Republic that have volunteered to create new textbooks about the First Civil War. Instead of the current arguments, we should rightly argue that there were good men on both sides, and that each side fought for what they thought was right. We should also emphasize the unity that occurred after the war, in an effort to promote unity in our own trying times. Further, we should emphasize the tyranny of the federal government during the Reconstruction period, in an effort to instill a distaste for such heavy handed governments. This may help prevent another MacArthur from rising in the future. Regardless, the next generation cannot be as divided as this one has been, and we will see to it that the whole country, North, South, East, and West, are united as one."

constate.1130.d:0 "Defending the southern way of life is a priority for the government under Richard Russell. One of the ways we could ultimately secure the gains of the South would be to extend some segregation laws to the entire country. For example, currently, 30 of the 48 states have bans on racially mixed marriages. Some states (Ohio, Iwoa, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Rhode Island, Washington, Woyoming) used to have laws like these in the past, but have since repealed them. Others (Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Vermont, Wisconsin, Minnesota) have never passed them. There have been several initiatives to standardize these regulations at the federal level. A total ban on mixed marriage was postulated by Representatives Andrew King in 1871 and then again in 1912 by Seaborn Roddenbery. The most radical proposal, however, was made in 1928, by Senator Coleman Blease. He proposed an amendment requiring that Congress set a punishment for interracial couples attempting to get married and for people officiating an interracial marriage. What should we do?"

However, more and more of this drug, called 'Marihuana' by Mexicans, is appearing in artistic circles, and many jazz musicians take such drugs before concerts. It can have a demoralizing effect on both White and Colored youth. For this reason, there are voices that say taxing cannabis cultivation will reduce the availability of illegal substances. These same groups have argued that with the invention of the decorticator, hemp had become a very cheap substitute for the paper pulp that was used in the newspaper industry. A ban would therefore increase the influence of wealthy northern industrial families, influence already present in the press and paper market. Examples include Andrew and Paul Mellon from Pennsylvania, Randolph Hearst from West Coast, and the Du Pont family from New England. What shall we decide on this substance?"

Nowadays, all over the country, you can smoke cigarettes of the 'Nigger Hair' brand after a meal at the 'Coon Chicken Inn' or 'Kentucky Fried Chicken' restaurants. In these restaurants, you can have Dixie and Creole Cuisine and drink 'Confederate-Cola' (a special line of Soda by Coca-Cola Company).

One example of this is the Holy Redeemer Church in Newton Grove, where the communion was distributed first to the White parishioners, and only later to the Black people who were waiting in the vestibule of the church.

Unbeknownst to his new wife Nan (played by Laraine Day), Collins is a man with a dark past. Before the Second American Civil War, he was Frank Johnson, a young worker with syndicalist connections. While working in New Jersey, Johnson’s political views drew him into an argument with a shop steward. Johnson killed the man and fled the state, changing his name to Brad Collins and moving South. He obtained a job with a shipping firm and began his life anew. Collins’ new life is disrupted when he runs into Christine (played by Janis Carter), his former girlfriend. Christine is a fashion photographer who is still an active Syndicalist, holding glamorous cocktail parties so she can seduce men and recruit them to the syndicalist underground.

The industrial application of such scientific achievements intrigued many industrialists, including Henry Ford, and they have pushed for these innovations to be adopted by the federal government as well. Senator Theodore G. Bilbo has gone so far as to encourage investment in the cultivation of industrial crops. In his opinion, this would allow for a quick recovery of both agriculture and industry destroyed by the war. The slogans of rebuilding agriculture in this way reached many nationalist groups (like the White Front in Florida), who not only encourage but insist on the implementation of these programs. Critics, however, point out that increasing the cultivation of industrial crops will dramatically increase food prices. For this reason, the decision is particularly difficult. What should we do?"

As such, their word may be biased. However, the American military has traditionally either denied blood from Black donors or applied the principle of blood segregation so that the White soldier would not receive even a drop of blood from a Black donor.

In response Hiram Wesley Evans has asked James Colescott for an alliance to counter-act this while Herbert W. Armstrong has turned to Christian fundamentalist Gerald B. Winrod by inviting him to be an Elder of Zion if he shifts further towards Christian Identity. The informal factions that have long been present but are finally boiling to the surface are now between Evans so-called Young Klan, Stephenson's Old Klan and finally Armstrong's Holy Church of Zion.

Nonetheless he is well-aware of why this offer has truly come up in that D.C.

According to the driver (whom claimed to have merely exited the vehicle to relieve himself) a wounded Armstrong crawled out of the car and lived longed enough to frantically beg for mercy while offering them money before the men fired upon him. D.C. Stephenson has given a speech over radio claiming that Armstrong had ordered the death of Evans and Evans men had retaliated, making sure to leave out the near-impossible time frame and circumstances of the latter's demise. He then called on the Old Democrats and NDWL to finally vote on the new Leader of the White League for the good of the nation and to show their loyalty to the memory of Evans and against Armstrong's plotting. Of course since few are willing to openly vote against him, this makes D.C. Stephenson the new American Emperor of the NDWL and President of the United States."

They know claim that they should be allow to control Southern California due to being less infamous than the Legion and more accepted. The Black Legion calls this nonsense, claiming they have more members in L.A. and that the territory rightfully belongs to one of their commanders.

Edward Jackson, Coleman Blease and Robert Rice Reynolds are the three main candidates, all of them being Old Klan members whom are nonetheless more 'mainstream' politicians.

Armstrong likewise decried a now shocked Stephenson as a 'pervert of the highest order.' Patton and his guards then entered the building and detained both Effinger and his Legion bodyguards alongside Stephenson as the other members of the Democratic White League decried them. A flustered William Bell Riley (officially still the head of state of the Constitutional Republic) was rushed onto center stage to read aloud the charges against a now frantic Stephenson whom switched between denial and decrying every member in the room, calling Evans a 'killer' and Armstrong "a hypocrite". Patton banged the gavel the second Riley was done reading and found him guilty, then had a wailing Stephenson dragged outside to the nearest tree and hung by four men holding the other side of the rope until he finally died. The question was now what to do with Effinger, with Evans demanding he be executed as well while Armstrong remained silent although some army men did not look forward to the Black Legion's reprisals if this occurred.

Nonetheless the hardliners are fanatically opposed to this.

Armstrong is attempting to make an alliance with Gerald B.

Himself a fundamentalist with mixed-feelings on Armstrong's brand of Christian Identity, William Bell Riley does see the appeal of Armstrong's leadership. The Old Klan militias are still focused on fighting Evans and meanwhile, Armstrong has kept himself from the worst of the fighting and does have potential as a unity leader.

The hardliners however stated that we should only agree to the Back to Africa mission, and grow an alliance with them from afar."
constate.25.a:0 "Agree with the Nationalists"
constate.25.b:0 "Agree with the moderates"
constate.25.c:0 "Ignore both, go with white hardliners"

constate.2500.d:0 "A founding member of the Black Legion in Michigan, Arthur F. Lupp Sr. has been arrested today for collaborating in a conspiracy to bring down the government. While Virgil Effinger gained greater fame than Lupp within the Legion and eventually wrested control of most of the Michigan Legion, Effinger's recent fall from grace has left Lupp as a more prominent member. Lupp's arrest coincided with a raid on nearby Legion cells that appeared to challenge the power of the Young Klan, leaving the movement both broken and leaderless."
constate.2500.a:0 "Very good"

constate.2501.t:0 "Starnes' past"
constate.2501.d:0 "Alabama representative Joe Starnes has been a loyal member of the ODP for years but his past is being increasingly questioned by members of the NDWL. While Starnes has defended the Klan, he was also responsible for commanding a unit of soldiers whom defended the black Scottsboro Boys from being killed by vigilante mobs after they were accused of killing two white women. While most of the anti-Klan factions privately consider the boys to have been innocent it makes little difference as they have already been executed. Nonetheless, Starnes standing against mobs looking to avenge white honor is a stretch too far for many even if he claims it was out of legal duty only, and some are wondering if we should force him to step down from his position."
constate.2501.a:0 "Have him step down"
constate.2501.b:0 "Let it go"

constate.2502.t:0 "Head of the ODP"
constate.2502.d:0 "While many think Alfala Bill should still be the leader of the ODP, in practice it matters little, and the ODP has become little more than a front organization for the NDWL. This is true among official designations such as state and local office, and they are also an organizing force on our behalf. As such, some members of the ODP have been jockeying to be appointed the head of the party and to increase their status in the process. Some believe the head of the ODP should be an NDWL member, and thus more outright subservient to us and officially a wing of the NDWL, while others want to keep them as a controlled opposition force, seeing them as more useful in this role. The fight is between Walter F. Bossert, whom wants to represent the ODP as a member of the NDWL, and Eugene Talmadge, who wants to remain more independent but would command more traditional Old Democrat loyalty. What shall we do?"
constate.2502.a:0 "Appoint Talmadge"
constate.2502.b:0 "Walter F. Bossert"

constate.26.t:0 "Marshal Policy"
constate.26.d:0 "We have founded the Marshals to regulate Klan activities throughout the region, bringing in the loosely coordinated members of the "Wrecking Crews" whom enforced Klan Law and giving them training and badges. An internal debate has begun however on how regulated the chapters should be, with some members such as James Colescott and the Klan Youth League wanting to write an official charter that will set stricter rules and acceptable punishments for those who stray from our law while William Green would prefer if we let them keep more autonomy and instead just have looser guidelines and warnings for them to follow when they are either too soft or too harsh."
constate.26.a:0 "Write a charter"
constate.26.b:0 "Let them have autonomy"

constate.2600.t:0 "Teacher Policy"
constate.2600.d:0 "With our new American Education Policy, our curriculum has expanded to push an explicitly pro-Klan, white supremacist viewpoint. However, there is the issue of older teachers still being present, many of whom had liberal connections prior to the war. It is doubtful that they will enthusiastically teach our new tenets, and they may try to avoid teaching them at all. As such, we could appoint a committee, headed by John Rankin, to examine centers of education and teachers. This committee will ensure teachers keep up with our new standards, rewarding those who do and punishing those who don't. The only question is what to do with the teachers we already know would be skeptical of our ideas, as arresting them en masse would leave us with a shortage of teachers and larger classes."
constate.2600.a:0 "Just set up Rankin's committee"
constate.2600.b:0 "The committee and a swift purge"

constate.27.t:0 "Papal deal?"
constate.27.d:0 "The Papacy has welcomed our slight relaxing of religious intolerance since [COR.GetLeader] took power but they wonder if we can't go a step further, with Archbishop's requesting we allow larger congregations of Catholics to meet in public for holidays and other events. Many are opposed though, if they are willing to pay a fee for our tolerance, it may be worth the price."
constate.27.a:0 "Let them pay for the privilege"
constate.27.b:0 "No"

constate.28.t:0 "Confederate Revival"
constate.28.d:0 "Since our victory there has been a renewed interest in the Confederate States of America, which the Klan already viewed with sympathy and believed, following Dixon and Griffith, that they defended the white race during a time of darkness. The writings and speeches of the late Mildred Lewis Rutherford have become increasingly popular, alongside membership into the Daughters of the Confederacy, while statues of male veterans have been increasingly erected across the nation. Some are wondering if we shouldn't adjust the education system and our national rhetoric to simply outright depict the war as one against the tyrant Lincoln at this point, although Northern ODP members (amongst others) believe it would be dangerous to the American Nationalism that gives us legitimacy over the rest of the nation and to keep our 'official' line on the civil war more neutral, albeit while allowing the Confederate revival in the process."

constate.28.b:0 "Keep quiet"

constate.29.t:0 "Capital of America"
constate.29.d:0 "With the civil war over, the question of what should be the capital for the new America has been brought up. Of the many cities within the country, four are the most promising. What city will be chosen as the new capital?"

constate.30.t:0 "Immigrant Repatriation"
constate.30.d:0 "We are in the process of repatriating those whom fail our standards and among demographics we have no further need of. Of course, how many we engage in repatriating has an impact on our economy, with many claiming that immigrants are needed for cheap labor and targeting Catholics will anger much of Europe. Due to this, they are wondering if we should stop here or do another round of repatriations towards Western Europeans who fail our standards to make their presence as minimal as possible."
constate.30.a:0 "Do the additional Repatriations"

constate.31.t:0 "National Showing: Birth of a Nation"
constate.31.d:0 "After an announcement from the government the film Birth of a Nation was shown at discount prices in virtually every theater, especially after a handful of unpatriotic holdouts refused to show it and were rewarded with their theater being burned to the ground. This is to be a National Holiday known as National Klan Day, with every newspaper still open either singing the praises of the Young Klan or, at most, staying silent while allowing their ads to be on them. After [COR.GetLeader] gave a speech outside the Egyptian in Hollywood early this morning he went in with national Klan leaders to watch the famous film by D.W. Griffith, who is now considered America's National Director. The propaganda stunt appears to be a success, with more of the public viewing us as true defenders of the white race, just as the film depicts."
constate.31.a:0 "A Success"

constate.32.t:0 "[COR.GetLeader] announces National Ceremonies"
constate.32.d:0 "The NDWL under the direction of the Young Klan has announced that the Ku Klux Klan will now officially be the leading organization of not only the NDWL but of America in general, and that the time has ended for 'secrecy', or whatever was left of it. He has declared National Klan Ceremonies will not be public and carried out by national leaders of the invisible empire, and in the correct uniforms. Celebrating this historic achievement, a cross was burned on outside the capital today after this speech, which stated that Congress would soon combine the positions of Klan Leader and NDWL leader which, for all intents an purposes, allows the Klan leadership to legally rule for life. Membership into the NDWL now also requires Klan membership, and all Anglo-Saxons born in the US will be registered with them at birth."
constate.32.a:0 "Victory!"

constate.33.t:0 "Promoting Stoddardism"
constate.33.d:0 "Lothrop Stoddard and the late Madison Grant have both had major influences on the Klan, with leading members being at least familiar with Grant's "The Passing of the Great Race" and Stoddard's "The Rising Tide of Color: The Threat Against White World-Supremacy". Some within the organization want for it to be required as university and even high school-level reading in related classes, but the tendency for both of these writers to split the White race into sub-categories make some nervous. Some disagree with their theories of Nordic superiority over the 'Alpine' and 'Mediterranean' race, or with Grant's belief that the 'Mediterranean' race holds abilities above the Nordic one. Others think the explicit and codified subcategories will make our appeal among Whites more limited as well, with some believing we should stick by current Klan policy of the "One-Drop Rule" and just dealing with different White races on a case-by-case basis."
constate.33.a:0 "It's too risky"
constate.33.b:0 "Teach it, it's a step forward"

constate.34.t:0 "Eugenics push"
constate.34.d:0 "Virtually all of the Young Klan is in agreement that Eugenics is the way forward if our population is to thrive but, there is some disagreement on the extent this should take. Part of the organization has pushed for sterilization of criminals, addicts and those with disabilities while others desire to extend it to mixed-race couples as well, though part of the organization thinks their descendants could be needed for labor jobs and that this would damage our economy, and it would encourage more organized resistance. Which should it be?"

constate.35.t:0 "The Hollywood List"
constate.35.d:0 "We know that Hollywood has always acted above the law. It's mere existence in California an attempt to dodge intellectual property laws. Moreover, it is no secret that some artists there had hoped for a syndicalist victory over our great American Republic. Their folly must be exposed and their sedition prosecuted."
constate.35.a:0 "We'll film their trials."

constate.36.t:0 "Persistence of Antisemitism"
constate.36.d:0 "With the great success of the Old Democratic Party in America, there comes as well some critics of the ideas presented in ODP literature. Especially within the Dearborn Independent, articles describing a massive worldwide conspiracy of Jews has created backlash as political cartoonists satirize it, albeit from underground. The public at large is beginning to question Ford's aging logic, and as Ford is not a very public man, his responses to the press have only damned him further. To the cabinet, including members of the national corporatist alliance, racial rhetoric around Jews must be pushed more subtly and anonymously. Most of the cabinet including [CON.GetLeader] still agree with Ford's theories, but disagree on the medium to propagate those ideas as to not destabilize the new America's international relations."
constate.36.a:0 "Side with Ford."
constate.36.b:0 "Side with the Cabinet."

constate.360.t:0 "National Renewal"
constate.360.d:0 "With the Civil War over, there are rigorous debates over how we should move forward as a nation. One of these debates has formed around the creation of a new national holiday. More conservative members of the ODP, as well as the NDWL, have argued that March 31st should be a holiday, to commemorate the end of Reconstruction in the South, as the original date was March 31st, 1877. However, the moderate wing of the ODP, supported by the Fordists, have instead noted that we should promote a national American culture now that the Civil War is over, and that such a holiday could anger Americans in other regions. They believe that the end of the Second Civil War should be a holiday instead, as it could serve as a holiday that everyone would celebrate. The clash between these two factions has been heated, and this seemingly small decision will have wider ramifications for how our government is perceived. What should we do?"
constate.360.a:0 "Promote Southern culture"
constate.360.b:0 "Establish a new national identity"

constate.37.t:0 "The State Social Department"
constate.37.d:0 "Our enactment of Protestant Corporatism requires a means of ensuring workers benefiting most from this arrangement are leading a moral lifestyle themselves. As such we look to the model of the Social Department which was a means of Fordist industry to investigate workers lifestyles to incentivize avoiding debauchery such as gambling, drinking, affairs, lazyness, dirtiness and having the wife work outside the home. Jack Bennett, whom oversaw the program, claims he can enact it on a state level, but wonders if we should only apply it to middle-class workers or those in the working class as well albeit at a higher expense."
constate.37.a:0 "Middle-Class Only"
constate.37.b:0 "Apply it to both Classes"

constate.38.t:0 "NDWL Demands Compensation!"
constate.38.d:0 "Our moves to pressure the many individual Klan societies that are separate from the state to disengage themselves and form societies more in-line with our values (and more subservient to the state) has seen push back of course, especially from the two formally opposing NDWL leaders: D.C. Stephenson and Hiram Wesley Evans. They are demanding monetary compensation for their organizations to shift in style and an allowance for small scale Klan gatherings. What shall we do?"
constate.38.a:0 "Pay out"
constate.38.b:0 "No need to bribe them"

constate.39.t:0 "Black Legion Protests!"
constate.39.d:0 "The Black Legion has been in opposition to the National Corporatist Old Democrats since they've taken power, and is now outraged by our attempts to reign them in and create Catholic Corporations. They are demanding that the best jobs be set aside for them which was the original plan of Protestant Corporatism anyways but now with the Black Legion in particular getting the best work. We could cave in at the requested cost of them dissolving the group in return for a future plan to reward them."
constate.39.a:0 "Give them the jobs"
constate.39.b:0 "No, we can't cave"

constate.40.t:0 "White League Attacks!"

constate.43.d:0 "It is no secret that Jews have come under increased hostility since the ODP has decided to regulate them as a foreign and potentially subversive element. However, some ODP members believe we have gone too hard on them, with a notable person of standing being the wealthy real estate mogul Fred Trump who has donated to and vouched for the ODP before but is also known for being sympathetic to the Jewish population and in strong disagreement with our policies relating to them. Recently he has had a meeting with Ford-man John Bennett requesting that he place a request for us to ease our restrictions no the Jewish population and end our rhetoric against them, offering 'campaign contributions' in return. What shall we do?"

constate.44.d:0 "Royal S. Gurden, the former leader of the Order of 76, was finally caught and killed today by Pinkerton agents who tracked him to an apartment building in Dallas. Gurden formed the American Nationalist association that was broadly aligned with both the ODP and Populist movements but splintered his organization when he decided to join the Silver Shirts of America against the ODP, leading to bad blood between his followers and even more hardline ones lead by Clare Hoffman. With his death the Order of 76 has avenged an old treachery, which is only made sweeter by Gulden giving up the location of other members before his death. Of course, it would be easier to just say we found them via documents in his apartment."

We could simply give the contracts to private businessmen aligned with our cause, especially the Ford Corporation itself, but some statists dislike this solution, preferring either direct government control or the market but with ownership of industries relevant to defense restricted to white protestants, depending on their views.

### Armstrong Events ###

constate.50.t:0 "Armstrong Appointed"
constate.50.d:0 "Herbert W. Armstrong has been appointed as the head of the NDWL as Evans remains too controversial during his continuing feud with the Old Klan, whom has been forced to step down as a Grand Dragon in favor of Sam Green. Declaring his intention to return the country to God and promising the fruits of His favor, Armstrong promises stability and the end to immorality, race-mixing and instability. However Even some of the NDWL remain hesistant regarding the beliefs of the Holy Church of Zion even with Armstrong keeping a lid on its most radical beliefs in public, especially the claims that they follow British Israelism and believe themselves to be the true direct descendants of the Israelites that were chosen by God, hence making them the true Jews."
constate.50.a:0 "It's in God's hands now"

constate.51.t:0 "Great Smallpox Outbreak"
constate.51.d:0 "A smallpox outbreak has broken out on the coastal regions of South and North Carolina, before spreading inward! Reports of smaller outbreaks throughout the nation are coming in from the Warriors of Jacob whom are looking to the Prophet for answers. As some are blaming our overturning of many forms of medical science for being unholy for the outbreak, they desire we go back on our policy of banning vaccines and distribute them widely. Of course, this would undermine our teachings."
constate.51.a:0 "Faith will see us through"

constate.5100.t:0 "Smallpox outbreak grows!"
constate.5100.d:0 "The smallpox outbreak has grown worse in recent days and it seems the sections of the nation are talking of rebellion! A segment of the NDWL is growing increasingly worried about Armstrong's leadership feeling he is not up to the job, particularly under the remnant of the Young Klan's Youth League that has long held him contempt for overthrowing the Young Klan. The Warriors of Elijah think we should move against them now, before they have a chance to strike, though this will make our war effort worse for wear."
constate.5100.a:0 "Clean house"
constate.5100.b:0 "No, we need their numbers for now"

constate.5101.t:0 "Armstrong Dead!"
constate.5101.d:0 "Herbert W. Armstrong is dead! After the Young Klan stormed the headquarters of the Church of Zion while he was speaking with heads of the faith, they were unceremoniously gunned down. The leaders of the coup are the youth leaders of the Young Klan whom survived the former purges, George Lincoln Rockwell and Francis Parker Yockey. Already they are announcing their intention to restore the nation, and bring peace and stability to white Americans everywhere while warning enemies of the new regime that they would 'not be met with mercy' if they stood in their way. But which shall lead the nation must be decided within their inner circle."

constate.5102.t:0 "The Law of Biological Integrity"
constate.5102.d:0 "The first law of group living in the animal world is that of biological integrity. This law says that one must hold an absolute, uncompromising loyalty towards their racial group. This loyalty comes from love and it is vehemently against any outsiders who try to mix with the racial group. This group loyalty is only natural, and yet there are those who label us as 'racists' for our beliefs, as if the true enemy is not the Yellow man, the Black man, the Jew, and other groups in our society who are not part of our race. Regardless, we must implement this law, for a tribe without loyal members is no tribe at all, and the same is true of our society!"
constate.5102.a:0 "The Creator insists on purity!"

constate.5103.t:0 "The Law of Territory"
constate.5103.d:0 "Unlike the vile Marxists and Syndicalists, we hold private property in high regard. After all, what is one of the most important goals of a gang or tribe? It is to stake out a "turf", a place for their group to reside in. The American manifestation of this ideal is through private property, and we must defend this property fiercely. Those who follow this law have been titled "Nationalists", and it is this ideology that we must follow. America is for Americans, and while we have nothing against the other gangs of the world, this is our land. We must defend it fiercely if we hope to hold it in the long run..."
constate.5103.a:0 "We will defend our turf!"

constate.5104.t:0 "The Law of Leadership"
constate.5104.d:0 "In the animal kingdom, leaders are never chosen by a 'vote'. No, in these groups, leaders are chosen through natural selection. The strongest and best individuals in each group rise to be the leaders, and the rest of the group follows a hierarchy beneath them. We cannot allow the vile mob rule that characterizes democracy. Instead, the toughest among us will lead, and through this understanding, we will be widely loved by our people!"
constate.5104.a:0 "Peace and order in our society!"

constate.5105.t:0 "The Law of Status"
constate.5105.d:0 "Similar to how our society must have its leaders, the other members must have their place as well. This law entails the natural order of ability of each person in society. They will all find their rightful place under the leaders, and each man will be respected for his loyalty. Farmers, laborers, soldiers, factory workers, it matters little, for all these men will be loyal to the nation, and they will be rewarded for their effort!"
constate.5105.a:0 "All is as it should be!"

constate.5106.t:0 "The Law of Motherhood"
constate.5106.d:0 "In nature, females stay out of the affairs of males, but today, this is not the case. To have a healthy society, we must have a female population that specializes in producing the next generation and rearing and organizing families. Millions of families lack the warm, nurturing mothers they need to raise children. These were the types of mothers that existed a mere century ago, and we must restore this state of affairs. We will honor women for their ancient roles as mothers, as wives, and most importantly, as the authors of good people."
constate.5106.a:0 "The Five Laws will order our society!"

constate.5107.t:0 "Combatting Cultural Parasitism"
constate.5107.d:0 "President Yockey has been holding a number of radio addresses and proclamations on the air about what he and his cabinet dubbed a 'process which will combat the cultural parasites and rot that threaten American society'. The main target of this process is the Black community in America, about whom President Yockey must now make a decision that will surely shape their lives. While the Black community in America has been living here for centuries and arguably could remain so if they lived in the separation they had in the South before the Secession War, Yockey believes it is crucial that this segregation is heightened and stricter to prevent what he calls cultural leeching. The other option we have is that of adopting the Liberia Plan, choosing to send the African-Americans back to Africa in the holdout of Liberia. What will we choose?"
constate.5107.a:0 "They can stay, just keep them at arm’s length"
constate.5107.b:0 "They shall be reunited with their cousins in Liberia"

constate.5108.t:0 "Breaking the Agents of Jacob"
constate.5108.d:0 "The Agents of Jacob were established under the Armstrong regime as a secret police and espionage organisation to enforce Christian Identitarian rule, committing horrific crimes against our own and hindering our coup in the process.\nNow that we are in power, we have the opportunity to exact revenge on these scum, and bring them to justice for abuses in the Armstrong era. However, our government is divided on whether we should allow the more junior Agents, many of whom only joined to advance their careers, to go free and transfer to loyal NDWL and Klan groups, or simply bring the entire organisation to justice."
constate.5108.a:0 "Let low-ranking members off in exchange for loyalty."
constate.5108.b:0 "Purge the lot."

constate.5109.t:0 "Ending Christian Identity"
constate.5109.d:0 "Christian Identity, Armstrong's heretical and degenerate cult which he sought to enforce on America, was officially banned shortly after its coup, with unease at its absurd doctrines having motivated many people to align themselves with the putsch in the first place.\nHowever, the Church remains influential in some areas of the country, particularly the Deep South where Armstrong focused recruitment efforts in the Civil War. This will only undermine our government in the long term, so we must find a means of stamping out Christian Identity for good.\nTo this end, some in the government believe that we should force all officials to pledge themselves against Armstrongism and generally tighten legal repression of the institution, while others favour an intensified propaganda campaign involving greater exposure of abuses under Armstrong's government, although this may implicate some of our own. Against both these groups, many in the military would rather we simply instituted violent crackdowns against known Christian Identitarians."
constate.5109.a:0 "Intensify legal suppression of Armstrong's cult."
constate.5109.b:0 "Expose Armstrong's crimes to the people."
constate.5109.c:0 "Side with the military and crush Armstrongism for good."

constate.5110.t:0 "Settling the Jewish Question"
constate.5110.d:0 "As all of the NDWL factions have long invariably believed, the Jewish population of America and the world is a subversive and self-interested element, uniterested in contributing to American society and linked to Bolshevism and cultural degeneracy.\nNow that we have secured our hold on power, it falls to President Yockey to settle the matter of our future policy towards the Jews. The moderates in our government want to revive William H. Murray's 1936 campaign promise of Jewish segregation, ensuring that Jews across America are placed in their own self-contained communities within designated cities.\nWithin the hardliner opposition to this, there are many nativists who would like to see Jews repatriated from America, across the Canadian border and on to destinations of their choosing far from our pleasant land. Meanwhile, there are those who believe that Yockey should not underestimate the lucrative possibility of cheap Jewish labor."
constate.5110.a:0 "Extend Jim Crow to the Jews."
constate.5110.b:0 "Repatriate them en masse."
constate.5110.c:0 "They will redeem themselves through labor."

constate.5111.t:0 "America for Christians"
constate.5111.d:0 "Rockwell’s intense disdain for Jews and other religious minorities in America has been ever known since his first public appearances and speeches. Even before his rise to power, Rockwell had many supporters, including the wealthy Harold N. Arrowsmith, who funded many of the young leader's early operations against these groups. These operations included burnings and attacks on Jewish-owned businesses and property. With Rockwell in power, his gangs have now been able to act with impunity, as laws have been put in place that allow them free reign on attacking groups that Rockwell deems as "socially corrupt". With a new campaign he has named "America for Christians", Rockwell has started an aggressive message across America that promotes Protestant Christian groups and even other Christians but officially targets religious minorities and paves the way for "unfortunate disappearances" of large groups of people that Rockwell has marked in his messages of being "criminally dangerous" in their beliefs. It is thought that these disappearances have taken the form of deportation, though further details are unknown." 
constate.5111.a:0 "Disappearances you say?"

constate.5112.t:0 "Fighting Crime"
constate.5112.d:0 "Rockwell has announced a new struggle against "the criminal population" of America and those who have reasonable suspicion to commit crimes in the future due to "ancestral ties to crime and degeneracy". Following these announcements, there was a significant increase in policing budgets, particularly for police and national guard stations in the Deep South and Black Belt of America. These efforts have led to a noticeable increase in the police presence in Black neighborhoods in cities and the rural parts of the South, with even national guard troops forming patrols in areas such as Tulsa, Oklahoma. With the restoration of order in mind, police departments have been increasing arrests for breaking Jim Crow laws and fining African-Americans with charges of "causing a commotion at late times" even for those simply walking out past 5 P.M. Even the death penalty has been increasingly used in state’s prisons against prisoners who have already been imprisoned for years before the new crime fighting bills."
constate.5112.a:0 "Finally, the White man can sleep peacefully!"

constate.52.t:0 "Christian Critics"
constate.52.d:0 "Christian Protestant leaders are not enthusiastic about adopting Christian Identity as its tenants go against traditional Christian doctrine, especially the claim that the British and therefor the Americans are the true descendants of the Jews. Prominent Southern Baptists such as Lee Rutland Scarborough and Monroe E. Dodd have written papers refuting our stance on specific doctrines despite admiring some of our views. Perhaps we should pressure the SBC to be more in-line with our beliefs?"

A celebration of the forty years the children of Israel wandered the desert, work is certainly not permitted on the first day. However if we are going to stop our population from celebrating Pagan celebrations and have them respect truly Christian ones we may want to ban all but the most vital work during the next seven days."

constate.54.t:0 "Divergent Thinking in Christian Identity"
constate.54.d:0 "The Holy Church of Zion has done its best to screen for religious beliefs when recruiting, but our new recruits often propagate beliefs that do not fit the Simmons-Armstrong line. One group out in California called 'Mankind United' claims that America's savior is their local minister. Another has insinuated the government is willing to assist Catholic nations in their liberation. The potential threat to our power is limited, but at the same time disunity breeds contempt. The Elders of Zion are divided as to whether these ideas are dangerous enough to stamp out. What are we to do about these outrageous claims?"

constate.55.t:0 "Rise of Speakeasies"
constate.55.d:0 "Despite the overwhelming wave of approval Prohibition received within the loyal Christian community, there were some with reservations. In the cities and up high in the mountains, illegal alcohol production has been reported by our agents. The demon drink is being produced by these moral traitors and is transported overnight to underground bars across the nation. We must stop this affront against our values, and catch the deviants responsible."
constate.55.a:0 "Alcoholism must be stamped out."

constate.56.t:0 "Breaking Catholicism"
constate.56.d:0 "Our war on those who see America a Godless, Pagan nation has reached new heights as we turn our attention on those who criticize our theology. Most notable of these is Fulton J. Sheen, a Catholic theologian who hosts 'The Catholic Hour' and has heavily criticized our anti-Catholicism and stances on Christ. After being arrested for denouncing the recent mass firing, investigation and occasional arrests of anti-state Catholics, Sheen was arrested and is now being interrogated for information related to the Papacy and underground terrorist networks. This will coincide with deeper investigations of Catholic and so-called 'Liberal Theologians' whom if found to be dangerous being penalized with deportation, arrest or other means."

Even Democrats such as Richard Russell Jr. are feeling the pressure to step down from public life, and a laundry list of liberals who slipped through arrest after our initial victory such as Jesse H. Jones are being arrested, alongside the various 'youth activists' organizing against us, especially in the West."

constate.58.d:0 "With our purge of the remnants of the Young Klan's Youth League that refused to join the Warriors of Elijah, Youth Leaders Francis Parker Yockey and George Lincoln Rockwell are dead. The ODP has felt increasing pressure to either retire, join our ranks or, if otherwise useful, keep quiet. Even former ODP leader John E. Rankin has kept quiet despite his known earlier opposition to our faith, and the Southern Baptist Convention has adopted planks adopting heavy elements of Christian Identity after Lee Rutland Scarborough was pressured to stand down by federal agents. Other churches that were once stubborn are either following their lead or their pastor's are being arrested, notably those calling Armstrong a 'false prophet' such as Conrad Bergendoff."

constate.5800.d:0 "A demonstration of protesters made up of an unlikely alliance of Lutherans, socialists and liberals joined together to denounce the regime from their soapboxes shortly after barricading the inner city of Chicago. With their lack of arms however the State Guard broke up the rally, resulting in the deaths of over 65 heretics. Shortly afterwards a riot broke out, resulting in over 1300 further deaths. While we managed to retake the city, it seems socialism has not yet been broken in Chicago. The Warriors of Elijah would prefer martial law to finish the job, whereas the Agents of Jacob believe counter-espionage and targeted assassinations would better do the trick."

constate.5801.d:0 "While Christian Identity has gained steam, it is still a minority of true believers. Of course, most heretics are too fearful or unorganized to truly stop it but in some isolated towns in the Midwest, especially Illinois, Minnesota and Nebraska, locals are not only refusing to shift their theology or give in to the government but have taken up arms. The town leaders of these revolts have formed a loose 'Granger' alliance, although they have few means of aiding one another directly besides coordinated attacks on the Warriors of Elijah and the State Guard. Armstrong would prefer to make an example of the revolting 'townies' by wiping them off the map, although some of the cabinet thinks merely taking them back would do."

constate.59.t:0 "Black Education Act"
constate.59.d:0 "The wave of public education changes implemented by Simmons in order to solidify Christian Identity into the youth of America is nearly complete. His final act, which passed with unanimous approval by the delegates, is the Black Education Act. The Black Education Act totally redefines education practices for ethnic minority communities and, in particular, African-Americans. Notably it makes it illegal to teach education to African-Americans divorced from their role as laborers, distances them from older notions of religious unity across races and slashes already minor public spending on Black Schools. As part of his speech announcing the law, Simmons stated, 'There is no place for the Negro in the Anglo Saxon community above the level of laborer. What is the use of teaching the Negro child mathematics, when it cannot use it in practice?'."
constate.59.a:0 "It's for the best"

constate.60.t:0 "The Black Belt Act"
constate.60.d:0 "One of the more controversial acts that Armstrong is proposing is to extend the 1899 Indian Appropriations Act into the African-American community. The proposed Black Belt Act would make communities in the South with majority African-American populations into a reserved space with independent public services. At least on paper, Armstrong claims these areas will be administered by African-Americans under the regime's jurisdiction, similar to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Moreover the Act would strip citizenship and any previous state support to African-Americans nationwide. Black inhabitants of the region will be banned from entering White territory. What shall become of this act?"
constate.60.a:0 "Perfect"
constate.60.b:0 "Not Now, Maybe Later."

constate.61.t:0 "The Pass Laws"
constate.61.d:0 "The Armstrong government has begun issuing a passbook to African-Americans throughout the Commonwealth in anticipation of the Pass Laws taking effect next year. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. The Church of Zion strongly discourages any comparisons to past laws and has defended the law as necessary to preserve the nation's Anglo-Saxon-Israeli heritage. This has resulted in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the Republic in order to intensify segregation, a policy in-line with Armstrong's fervent opposition to race-mixing in most forms."
constate.61.a:0 "Papers Please."

constate.62.t:0 "The Penal Act"
constate.62.d:0 "While the Thirteenth Amendment made slavery illegal throughout the country this was little more than a show of force by a group of radicals to subjugate the South and was never part of the original Constitution. As such, the 13th Amendment has been repealed to the applause of NDWL delegates. However, to wholly bring back slavery would be too difficult and unpopular among all but the most hardline NDWL factions, and as such a new order signed off on by the President has increased the sentence time for moral crimes, and provided for more use of indentured labor in industry, thus being named the Penal Act, something that was far more palpable to the population. This Penal Labor has been given boost by our reviving of various Black Codes. The boisterous speeches Klan representatives delivers on the radio celebrates this defense of White Protestant morality."

constate.63.t:0 "The Third Great Migration"
constate.63.d:0 "Those thousands of African-Americans that left America before the civil war are being joined by hundreds of thousands more fleeing White Leaguer terror. Groups like the International Labor Defense and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate masses of people struggling to remain free. To the White Defense Leagues and their leaders, this plays into a long-standing fear of a united front against their rule. At the same time, the fewer the dissidents internally, the safer loyalists can sleep. The question is: what shall we do? Shall we let them leave, or shall we keep them here?"

constate.64.d.liberia:0 "The thousands that arrived with Marcus Garvey in the early 1930s anticipated that more refugees would come. Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
constate.64.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Simmons is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Silver Legion's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Legionary regime of America."
constate.64.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Simmons should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
constate.64.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
constate.64.d.hawaii:0 "An incredible amount of the Pacific separated us from the carnage in America, as well as the hand of the terroristic White Leagues. We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Silver Legion that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers."

### Klan ###
constate.65.t:0 "NDWL Expansion"
constate.65.d:0 "Since their promotions the NDWL is gaining increasing numbers among soldiers and new recruits, giving them widespread influence over the military. Increasingly they are using this to pressure Old Democratic party members in the Senate to sign up for the NDWL and are pushing out our Fordist allies from their influence by handing out military contracts to NDWL supporting businesses and states. Most shockingly, even Captains of the National Guard are switching their allegiance despite technically answering to Old Democratic Party Governors. It is clear that William Joseph Simmons is gathering support to become the leader of our Republic but to demote them would damage the war effort at this point. Of course, expanding their influence would anger the Black population we are attempting to keep a lid on at the moment."
constate.65.a:0 "Not much we can do"
constate.65.b:0 "Disallow it"

constate.66.t:0 "Simmons Calls for a Convention!"
constate.66.d:0 "William Joseph Simmons and the NDWL has called for a special convention in [COR.GetCapital] to allow for himself to be appointed head of military operation and the de facto Commander-In-Chief of the nation. He has acknowledged the ODP as allies and says the current President will be rewarded for the loyalty via political and military appointments but states the NDWL is still the future of America and their empowerment is necessary to save America from 'left radicals, liberals and their duped Negro supporters'. With the backing of Hiram Wesley Evans Klan, D.C. Stephenson's various white leagues and terrorist groups, Armstrong's and the Christian Identitarians endorsement and even many ODP members no longer resisting it is clear he will be appointed Commander-In-Chief. While the Constitutional American Republic does not exactly allow for this as the head of the nation is currently empowered with virtually unlimited autocratic powers the ODP does not have the stability needed to hold its ground and to oppose the Klan-political machine it would be the end of the Republic. "
constate.66.a:0 "Well... Damn"

constate.67.t:0 "Simmons Elected!"
constate.67.d:0 "William Joseph Simmons has been elected head of the Constitutional American Republic's government via the Delegate system although the current President still enjoys a symbolic status as the Founder of the Nation it is clear he and the NDWL is running the show now. "
constate.67.a:0 "So be it"

constate.68.t:0 "Black Taxation?"
constate.68.d:0 "Some members of the ODP and NDWL are pushing is to increase our taxation of black neighborhoods for the war effort. Arguing that their loyalty is tenous to the new state and that their 'disloyalty' to the cause and that their challenges to our social structures resulted in this war. As such ODP member John E. Rankin and NDWL leaders are requesting we use their resources for the war, and as retribution, before it is used against us. Of course other ODP members and the military advise against this, noting we can not afford to anger the Black population as riots and black militias would be massively damaging to our war effort instead suggesting we respect their relative autonomy in their own neighborhoods for now."
constate.68.a:0 "A dangerous suggestion"
constate.68.b:0 "It's time they paid up"

constate.69.t:0 "Black Conscription?"
constate.69.d:0 "While our taxation of Black Neighborhoods was profitable it has increased Black Resistance to our goals, causing cries to further penalize them. Most of the ODP and NDWL, including Young Klan General Wickliffe Drapper, do not think Blacks are mentally capable of being proficient combat soldiers. However, with our shortage of numbers and black resistance to sacrificing for the CAR there are widespread demands to conscript black soldiers for menial labor jobs, support positions and basic infantry charges. Obviously this would greatly anger the 'Black Belt' that houses most of our black population and our internal police services recommend it although our political factions are strongly pushing for it."
constate.69.a:0 "Do it"
constate.69.b:0 "It's too dangerous"

### ODP Events ###

constate.70.t:0 "Democratic Party Absorbed"
constate.70.d:0 "As the ODP cements its stronghold over the nation, our loyal opposition in the Democratic Party has come to be absorbed in increasingly large number by the ODP. Richard Russell leads the final sizeable chunk of traditional Democratic opposition to the ODP, desiring a more liberal government, alongside some allies further West. Of course, all notable elections apart from a handful of seats are already decided by the ODP's slate, but we could make it more difficult for the Democrats to run by ignoring more of their candidacies and not even bother debating them, simply running slates even in the few areas of the country where the Democrats are present, leaving Russell without allies and only allowing the most loyal opposition Democrats to remain."
constate.70.a:0 "Run more ODP Slates"
constate.70.b:0 "Tolerate the Democrats"
constate.70.c:0 "Try to Fully absorb the Democrats"

constate.71.t:0 "Legality of the Republican Party"
constate.71.d:0 "The Republican Party has been a traditional foe of the ODP, save for of course the far-right sections of that converted to the ODP anyways. The Party housed both progressive and so-called 'conservative' Industrialist wings that were openly anti-ODP, anti-farmer, anti-tradition and for banks and corporations, and sided with the PSA, New England and MacArthur over us, with Tafts, 'Landon Republicans' and Roosevelts all denouncing us. With the ODP dominant on nearly all levels of government, the question of whether or not to allow the party to continue to exist legally at a local level, if only for the handful of former Republicans who were aligned with us and to avoid a potential appearance of tyranny. Most would prefer if it was simply outlawed however."
constate.71.a:0 "Allow it to exist"
constate.71.b:0 "Ban it"

constate.72.t:0 "State of Sequoyah"
constate.72.d:0 "As apart of our outreach to native communities aligned with our cause, the old idea of the State of Sequoyah has returned, which would see the East most part of Oklahoma being made into a small state for the nicknamed 'Five Civilized Tribes'. The Tribes have stated they would be willing to give more support in return for the territory, although some ODP members and especially NDWL members would prefer if we just gave them some more autonomy without giving them a full-fledged state. Of course, William H. Murray himself famously favored the proposition, making it that much more likely."
constate.72.a:0 "Create the State of Sequoyah"
constate.72.b:0 "Just grant more autonomy"

constate.73.t:0 "Reorganizing Farm interests"
constate.73.d:0 "While many farmers did side with us during the war those farmers who do support us remain unorganized apart from using the ODP for meetings and coordination. Many organized farmers were unreliable during the war, often leaning towards the AUS and SPA although much of the American Farm Bureau and Future Farmers of America did breakaway to support us. As we focus on farm issues it's been suggested to merge the FFA and AFB into the National Democratic Farm Bureau, which will help train youth farmers, organize and educate them on relevant issues and introduce them to advanced and new farming methods, alongside research. ODP members such as John E. Rankin have proposed simply doubling down on using the ODP which, while more unorganized for farm issues, would be more useful in advancing political causes and would be an easier pill to swallow for those opposed to what could be viewed as a form of unionization, albeit one with heavy ODP influence."
constate.73.a:0 "Organize the NDFB"
constate.73.b:0 "Use the ODP"

constate.74.t:0 "The Jacksonian Democratic Party"
constate.74.d:0 "With our rise, we have managed to register the majority of white men in America with the ODP, using the party as a centerpiece of New America. In order to reconcile Jacksonian Democracy with a One-Party State, two proposals have been put forward. The first is from the NDWL and political bosses such as Talmadge would see a continuation of our current policy of offering ODP slated candidates, who can then be elected by the population for local election. From there, we can pick and choose the most popular and party-friendly candidates to move up the ranks to ensure a representation of the people. The other proposal put forward by Carl Vinson and John H. Bankhead II would somewhat invert the process, toning down the choosing of slate candidates to allow for more open local elections while only allowing pre-selected ODP members to run straight for, and control, higher offices while responding to local elections. Of course in both cases for the national government most positions will be selected by the ODP when relevant, either by only offering them as the only feasible candidate or ensuring their election by other means in return for them serving the state and people of America, but one would use closed local elections before choosing the more popular candidates while the other would open local elections but leave national government more insulated."
constate.74.a:0 "The Talmadge-NDWL Plan"
constate.74.b:0 "The Vinson-Bankhead Plan"

constate.75.t:0 "National Klan Regulations"
constate.75.d:0 "We have passed the National Klan Regulations which would see the Klan formally regulated. All Klan members must now be licensed with the Federal Government, can not engage in what is viewed as 'deadly' force without state government (and by extension larger ODP) approval and 'large gatherings of over 50 people' must be attended by at least one ODP representative. Furthermore, the Black Legion is to end all 'terror' attacks, in return being offered amnesty for those already performed. The question of whether to keep the Klan separated at the state level or to consolidate them in a National Force under Hiram Wesley Evans is up for debate, the former being better for keeping them unorganized and the latter to more easily regulate them."
constate.75.a:0 "Regulate a National Klan"
constate.75.b:0 "Regulate State Klans"

constate.76.t:0 "The Potential Scandal"
constate.76.d:0 "The Bureau of Information has come across some rather disturbing information relating to the Grand Dragon of Indiana, D.C. Stephenson. Stephenson has been a thorn in the ODP's side for awhile due to his clearly ambitious nature, and was angered at our decision to dissolve the Black Legion into the Klan. Now however investigators have privately relayed what has been long rumored but never confirmed, which is that Stephenson is an alcoholic, legally a bigamist and engages in debauchery. Much worse however is what was not even rumored as he appears to be a sexual deviant whom used his position in Indiana to assault women, especially POW's during the war. It will likely not be long before this becomes public, even if it's not by our hand. As such, to avoid the ODP having to suffer public relations damage from association with him we have been advised to either arrest him or to have him removed more... quietly."
constate.76.a:0 "Arrest him and his men"
constate.76.b:0 "Make it look like an accident"

constate.77.t:0 "D.C. Stephenson dies!"
constate.77.d:0 "Today, D.C. Stephenson has been found dead in his home, reportedly having died of a heart attack! Of course, many are suspicious of the circumstances given that it is rumored several men were seen entering his home and his body was immediately cremated but after we pressure his associates with blackmail material of what they and Stephenson were engaging in the issue should disappear."
constate.77.a:0 "It will have to do"

constate.78.t:0 "D.C. Stephenson Arrested!"
constate.78.d:0 "D.C. Stephenson and several of his NDWL associates have been arrested! While this caused outrage among the Indiana Klan when it was revealed what Stephenson was doing much of the controversy was buried as the Indiana Klan sought to distance themselves. Of course, the group has fallen out in favor not only in Indiana but in surrounding states, to the NDWL's outrage and the ODP's gain. Stephenson himself has already been sentenced to death but shall we remove Governor Jackson as well, the Indiana Governor whom aligned himself with Stephenson but now swears allegiance to us?"
constate.78.a:0 "Remove Jackson"
constate.78.b:0 "Make sure he's loyal"

constate.79.t:0 "UNIA Offer"
constate.79.d:0 "The Universal Negro Improvement Association is known for being one of the few black organizations to favor cutting a deal with the ODP and to be anti-socialist. They have offered to give us additional information on black socialists if allowed to operate freely within the Black Belt and to send blacks to Liberia on their Back to Africa plan. Some ODP members and especially the Young Klan view this as an opportunity, although no national ODP leaders want to engage in the Young Klan's form of race separatism that they believe threatens the economy and traditional life. Of course, ODP hardliners claims we have little need of them."
constate.79.a:0 "Allow it"
constate.79.b:0 "No"

constate.80.t:0 "Black Intellectuals Denounce Us!"
constate.80.d:0 "From exile a laundry list of Black Intellectuals in syndicalist or 'liberal' nations have denounced us, with Harry Haywood writing 'Neo-Segregation: A Weapon of National Oppression', a follow-up to his 'Lynching: A Weapon of National Oppression' which purports to demonstrate what Haywood calls 'reactionary terror that has possessed the United States even more formally than before', while W.E.B. DuBois and Thurgood Marshall have attempted to collect support for rebels in foreign nations and written against us as well. They have failed in their former task but succeeded in the later, though only some of their literature has made it through our bans."

constate.2705.d:0 "The situation in Canada has worsened. Key positions in the region have fallen to the extremist Americans and we are struggling to cope. Now, the Americans have sent us an offer of peace talks. Despite concerns that this will be considered as a humiliation, and possibly the end of the Entente as we know it, a wise move might be to give up control of the region. We have neither the manpower nor the resources to take back Canada, and we must consider our coming confrontation with the Third Internationale. However, escaped British and Canadian officials are urging us to continue the war, and we will be a laughing stock on the world stage if we sign such a peacedeal. What should we do?"

When the governors arrived, the press only saw the image of a defiant America determined to fight the illegitimate powers of federal corruption and syndicalist oppression. However not all southern governors were in attendance. Governor James V. Allred of Texas sided with Huey Long and Governor Bibb Graves refused to side with the Constitutionalists, something that had him driven out of his home state by Klan-Aligned militias. The loyal governors are now meeting with [COR.GetLeader] inside the statehouse to determine the proper response to the federal government's deadline."

Along his speech he blamed many things for America’s downfall such as the establishment 'selling out' to Republican Industrialists, Catholic votes, Jewish money and Washington Bureaucrats, and that Macarthur’s blatant disrespect for America’s tradition was the ‘Nail in the Coffin’. As his speech ended, he declared the need to resist the traitors, and declared that the Constitutional American Republic would return America to the greatness of the Jacksonian era. "

Some came to wish [COR.GetLeader] well and stayed, others simply to court favour with the revolution. These meetings in Atlanta began to take on a Congressional appearance, with Talmadge standing as the President of the attending senators. Aware of the growing determination to defy the federal government, and that this lack of willingness to negotiate meant civil war was all but certain, a large number of politicians have slinked away to the north... though those that remain seem more determined than ever to see victory."
constate.152.a:0 "They'll get theirs!"

constate.153.t:0 "Deadline Looms"

Across the part of the country controlled by Long's supporters, an army formed of militia and the Minutemen has been raised and a growing determination to see the country remade by force has taken hold. The federal government, in turn, has also made it clear they no longer see a path to compromise."

### Portrait ###

constate.310.t:0 "A New Jacksonian Golden Age"
constate.310.d:0 "With the Second American Civil War slowly fading into distant memory and with the great Alfalfa Bill Murray standing resolute at the helm of our great republic, this great nation and our noble people have slowly begun to heal. With this recovery has also come a fond remembrance for older times in America, to a great President who served this nation so dutifully in an age before our nation was ever sullied by the horrors of fratricide. \n\nThis great Commander in Chief was none other than Andrew Jackson, 7th President of the United States and a champion of the people against carpetbaggers and anti-American elements, has become something of an idol to our healing people, with many in our nation likening President Murray to this hallowed and deeply honored figure. \n\nThis adoration is not just hollow praise and fanfare however, for which it has also begun to affect the nation as a whole. The New Jackson, as Murray has quickly become known as to many ardent patriots, has become the idol of a new cultural resurgence, harkening back to the post-Revolutionary age of this great nation that was the Jacksonian Era. With tastes in food, music, and other aspects of both high and low culture shifting to emulate and modernize the Jacksonian aesthetic, the wider identity of the Constitutional American Republic has already begun to show signs of this new Jacksonian Golden Age. \n\nMost curiously of all the aspects of our society affected by this has been its effect on the fashion industry, which has unexpectedly taken off with the idea completely. A new wave of New-Jacksonian fashion has exploded onto the scene, with poufy-armed shirts, double-breasted and stand-collar waist coats, stocks with bows, and fall front trousers - all clothes designed for the common working man - exploding in popularity once more with the men of our fine republic. Not to be left out, women’s fashion has also taken a large turn, with loose-corsets, semi-poufy skirts, and other designs with labor in mind typical of the original Jacksonian era of the 1820s-40s. Most popular of these new designs has been the return of what has been colloquially dubbed the ‘Jacksonian suit.’ Usually a black ditto suit or frock coat tuxedo with flared collar and large lapels atop a white shirt, and frequently accompanied with a flowing red cape to emulate the famous Ralph Earl portrait of the national hero, these suits have exploded in popularity across the nation. Though more popular among the more elite and upper class of our republic, that has not stopped these dashing numbers to become a common sight in cities across Dixie and beyond, with even President Murray occasionally being seen wearing one. \n\nWhether it be affecting fashion or art or cuisine, this new Jacksonian Golden Age has proven to be a much needed distraction for our wartorn populace. Time heals all wounds for sure, but nothing like a little nostalgia to help numb the pain and speed along the process of reconstruction, of both nation and spirit."
constate.310.a:0 "A true showing of patriotism, but I’ll keep my hat."
constate.310.b:0 "Let us toast this return to higher culture and tastes."

constate.500.d:0 "After Patton announced his Motorisation program for the new American Army, a proposal was sent to President Long to decide on the requisition of civilian vehicles in order to supply our fastly-growing army. With his approval, we have begun seizing vehicles from the civilian populace, although to our surprise, some proud patriots line up next to our storages to volunteer their vehicles for the incoming fight. While not all their vehicles have proven to be useful for us, we have managed to requisition a fair amount of trucks which can either be modified to transport troops with ease or which are sturdy enough to transport our troops at once."

constate.501.d:0 "While technically speaking, the first paradropping excercises were practiced in 1930 with biplanes dropping machine gun squads, today a major breakthrough has been achieved in the airborne department. After finishing a rigorous conditioning and training program started two weeks ago, a lottery was made to decide the jumping order of the experimental paradropping platoon made up of volunteers. When the Douglas C-33 took off from the Lawson Air Field and finally was put into position to start the experiment, Second Lieutenant William T. Ryder became the first American Paratrooper after making his jump and landing near Fort Benning. The second man, however, refused to jump, and so the first enlisted man to become a paratrooper was Pvt. William N. "Red" King, and then the remaining 8 platoon members in the aircraft. After their touchdown, they quickly reached the rendezvous point and completed their excercise goals, making the experiment a success."
constate.501.a:0 "Start Scheduling New Jumps"

constate.502.t:0 "Formation of the First Paratrooper Divisions"
constate.502.d:0 "With the success of our scheduled mass jumps and with the blessing of General Patton, Fort Benning had begun taking volunteers for paratrooper units. While originally the high training standards and relatively high mortal risk initially caused few volunteers to show up, the high command authorized a triplication of the paratrooper wage as opposed to the foot soldier wage. Soon enough, the 501st Parachute Battalion was formed, quickly followed by other battalions and regiments. After a week recruitment, the number of volunteers was enough to form 5 paratrooper divisions for us to utilize. While these divisions still lack combat experience, this breakthrough in Airborne tactics should not be underestimated, and the High Command is looking forward to seeing their investment in these divisions pay off."

#AUS's Army General Descriptions by Drozdovite#
###############################################

COR_GEORGE_MOSELEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W September 28, 1874, in Evanston, Illinois, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Van Horn Moseley graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1899 as a cavalry second lieutenant. He would serve in the Spanish American War commanding the 9th Cavalry Regiment where he even managed to achieve a major breakthrough against Ludovico Arejola, prompting a promotion to first lieutenant and a transfer to the 1st Cavalry Regiment. There he'd serve as Aide-de-Camp for Brigadier General J.M. Bell and J.M. Lee for the remainder of the campaign, fulfilling several staff roles in the rear. He'd be transferred back to the US in 1904, and would serve as a staff member of the Texas Headquarters, until being promoted to Captain in 1906. He'd continue to fill a variety of staff roles while at the same time attending the Army Staff College and the Army War College, of which he graduated in 1909 and 1911 respectively. He took part in Pershing's punitive expedition, providing logistical support to Pershing, and earning him the promotion to major. After commanding the Second Field Artillery Brigade, he was detailed as assistant to General Dawes in organizing the Bureau of the Budget in 1921, after which he was promoted to Brigadier General for his remarkable performance. He'd become Executive Assistant to the Assistant Secretary of War and was put in charge of the Industrial Preparedness sector, which got him his promotion to Major General. In 1934 he had a major fall out with General MacArthur, and with the country's collapse into civil war, Moseley's first course of action was to leave the Federal Army and join the Constitutional Army in the south, where his experience and the lack of capable staff granted him an immediate promotion to Field Marshall by William H. Murray.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Has displayed strong anti-immigrant and anti-semitic views both publicly and privately.\n- Along with Charles Lindbergh, Moseley has been seen in frequent meetings with important businessmen from outside the military sphere."
COR_GEORGE_PATTON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 11, 1885, in San Gabriel, California, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Smith Patton Jr., a fan of military history books from an early age, joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1903. In his second year, he was nominated for West Point, and while he performed excellently in the drill procedures at West Point, his academic performance was so bad that he was forced to repeat his first year. Despite all setbacks, he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1909 and was assigned with the 15th Cavalry Regiment. In 1912, his athletic skills made him the army's choice to represent the United States for the first modern Pentathlon in the Stockholm Olympic games, ranking fifth out of forty two participants. With the launching of the punitive expedition, Patton became Pershing's Aide-de-Camp during the largely unsuccessful expedition, but this strengthened ties between them and Patton became an almost permanent member of his staff and was promoted to Captain soon enough. He was promoted to Major in June 31, 1920 and began taking an interest in the Weltkrieg’s use of mechanized warfare. In 1923 he'd graduate from the Cavalry's Field Officer's Course, from the Command and General Staff College in 1924 and the Army War College in 1932. During the protests of the Bonus Army, Patton had a major falling out with MacArthur, after which Patton vocally opposed his colleague constantly, and he decided to leave to the Constitutionalists, seeing that the Federal Government was bound to fail if decisive action wasn't taken. With his reputation preceding him, William H. Murray decided to skip the rank of general and name Patton an outright Field Marshall, a role which Patton claims to be more than prepared to fulfill.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While publicly his loyalty remains unquestioned, his former friendship with Dwight Eisenhower make many members of the staff distrustful of Patton\n- Has displayed strong racist views in public."
COR_COURTNEY_HODGES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W 05 January, 1887, in Houston County, Georgia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Courtney Hicks Hodges began his military career when he joined West Point in 1904, but was forced to drop out a year later due to his extremely poor academic performance. Undeterred, he enlisted in the army in 1906 as a private, where he quickly rose to the rank of sergeant in 1907 and earned a commission as a second lieutenant in 1909. He joined Pershing during the Punitive Expedition, where he met George S. Patton and George Marshall, and would remain in the Mexican border for the rest of the late 1910s, facing off several small skirmisher groups with the 6th Infantry Regiment. After being promoted to Major for his service at the border, he attended the Command and General Staff College, graduating in 1925 and becoming a member of the Infantry Board at Fort Benning. In 1934, graduated from the Army War College, earning him his promotion to lieutenant colonel. With Patton and Marshall vocally opposing MacArthur, Hodges was forced to choose between either one of his friends in case the situation deteriorated. He chose the former, as Patton managed to sway Hodges into joining him in the CAR Army, where the now Field Marshal Patton has offered his friend Hodges an early promotion to Brigadier General."
COR_WILLIAM_SIMPSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 18, 1888, at Weatherford, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W In June 1905, a month after turning 17, he entered the United States Military Academy at West Point, and graduated four years later in June 1909, being commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Infantry Branch. Simpson's first assignment was with the 6th Infantry Regiment at Fort Lincoln, North Dakota. Soon afterwards the regiment was sent overseas to Mindanao, in the Philippines, in January 1910 and remained there for another two-and-a-half years, where Simpson participated in the suppression of the Moro Rebellion. He returned to the United States with his regiment in 1912 and, being stationed at Fort Bliss, remained there as a company commander until, now promoted to first lieutenant, he fought in Pershing's Punitive Expedition in 1916. In February 1917 he became aide-de-camp to Major General George Bell, Jr., who commanded the El Paso Military District. Since 1919, Simpson has filled several staff appointments and attended military schools and courses and would be promoted in early 1921 to Captain. Simpson served with the General Staff until 1932 where he began teaching military science and tactics at Pomona College until 1936, being promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1934. As the country spiralled out of control, Simpson became more and more aligned with Huey Long's vision of America as time passed, and when Huey finally proclaimed the American Union State, Simpson presented his services to what he sees as the true American government. For his loyalty, Simpson was turned into a brigadier general."
COR_WALTON_WALKER_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W December 3, 1889, in Belton, Texas, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Walton Harris Walker began his military career when he joined the Virginia Military Institute in 1907 and entered the United States Military Academy in 1908, graduating in 1912 as an infantry second lieutenant. He'd be posted mostly in garrison duties throughout Texas, where the only exceptions where when he took part in the Veracruz Expedition, and taking part in the border patrols along the Mexican border, where he befriended Dwight Eisenhower. After 1920, Walker served as an instructor at Fort Benning, Georgia and underwent further tactical training by the Army, attending the Command and General Staff School in 1925 and graduating in 1926 as a lieutenant colonel. He'd be moved to the American Legation in Tianjin in 1930, and would return to America in 1933 to sign up for the Army War College, where he graduated in mid-1936. As the situation in the country deteriorated, Walker started to side with Patton during the staff meetings, deeply criticizing MacArthur for his inaction against socialists. When Huey Long finally declared the American Union State, Walker decided to join his colleague Patton in the south, who granted him the rank of Brigadier General."
COR_MATTHEW_RIDGWAY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 3, 1895, in Fort Monroe, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Matthew Bunker 'Old Iron Tits' Ridgway began his military career in 1913 when he successfully passed the entrance exam to West Point after failing the year prior. He graduated from the academy in 1917 as an infantry second lieutenant. Ridgway was first assigned to patrol duty in the Mexican border with the 3rd Infantry Regiment, where he reached the rank of Captain and would return to West Point in 1920 as a Spanish teacher. In 1925, Ridgway graduated from the United States Army Infantry School, after which he was sent to the American Legation in Tianjin and later sent to Nicaragua, where he was one of the American COs trying to supervise the 1927 elections. In 1930, he'd be transferred to the Philippines, where he became an advisor to the Governor-General of the islands and would return to America in 1933 as a Major. He'd graduate from the Army Command and General Staff School in 1935 and was attending the Army War College in Pennsylvania before the Civil War broke out. With the ever increasing radicalisation, he found himself being harrassed several times by 'workers' militias' and slowly began losing faith in the Federal Government. When Huey Long finally proclaimed the American Union State, Ridgway decided it was best to leave for the AUS if that was necessary to save America from anarchy, where he was promoted to Brigadier General."

COR_HENRY_HODES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 19, 1899, in Washington D.C., United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Henry Irving Hodes began his military career when he joined the United States Military Academy, from where he graduated as a cavalry second lieutenant in 1920. After fulfilling a series of staff roles, mainly in Wyoming and Texas, he found himself strongly advocating for the mechanisation of the American Army along with Patton, which due to the army budget cuts, it became nothing more than a pipe dream for them. As Patton began to slowly drift away from the US Army staff, Hodes strengthened his ties with the 'Old Blood and Guts', and when Patton finally announced he was joining the Union States, Hodes accompanied him and was promoted to Brigadier General."
COR_CLIFTON_CATES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 31, 1893, in Tiptonville, Tennessee, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Clifton Bledsoe 'Lucky' Cates began his military career after graduating from the Missouri Military Academy in 1910 as a second lieutenant for the Marine Corps Reserves. His excellent performance in drills and his qualifications caught the attention of the then Brigadier General George Barnett, who took Cates as his aide-de-camp. Cates would serve with Barnett until 1923, where Cates, who was now a Captain, was assigned to command the Marine detachment in the USS Arizona. In 1928, he was transferred to the to the 4th Marine Regiment in San Diego which would be transferred to guard the American Legation in Shanghai.

He'd be then transferred to command the 'China Marines' in Shanghai in 1933 and would return to America in June 1936 to serve as an as an instructor at The Basic School. With the nation spiralling into Civil War, Puller was persuaded by Cates to join the American Civil War as Puller was indecisive as to who to support. With his arrival at Louisiana, Puller's actions in Nicaragua and Haiti had earned the respect of many members of the staff and Huey Long's cabinet, who pushed for his promotion to Brigadier General."

He succeded Major Spaatz in the 7th Bomb group after Spaatz promotion. McNarney then became an instructor at the Army War College in Washington, serving from August 1933 to March 1935, where he was redeployed as an attaché to Canada. With the outbreak of the Civil War, McNarney decided that it was best to leave to a place where his particular skills were in short supply, and join the Constitutional American Republic, the faction that closest aligned with his views. The Constitutionalist staff was more than happy to welcome him from Canada."

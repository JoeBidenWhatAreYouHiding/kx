POLITICS_Olyimpio_DESC:0 "Sylvanus Épiphanio Olympio, born with a silver spoon in 1902 to one of the most influential families in Africa, stands as possibly the richest and certainly the most powerful man in Togo, ascending to become the first president of an independent Togolese republic as the very instrument of our newfound sovereignty. Educated in the Christian schools of the German colonizers and studying in economics under the famed Harold Laski, Olympio entered the working world a sharp, well-rounded, and ambitious intellectual, ready to carry the Togolese people into the future as they chafed under the Kaisererich’s colonial rule. Now, with the Westafrikan regime destroyed and his uncle Octaviano falling ill as he withers with age, Sylvanus has become patriarch of the dominating Afro-Brazilian Olympio family. Sylvanus now walks in the footsteps of his famed and beloved uncle who forged Lome into the modern gem of a city it is today, and Olympio seeks to carry on this legacy by leading the young Togolese republic into a prosperous and secure future - one where both he and his people profit and thrive."
POLITICS_KLEBER_DADJO_DESC:0 "Few have risen through the ranks of the Togolesische Garde as quickly as Kléber Dadjo, but this once mere Nawde askari has quickly climbed himself to the top of the Togolese military hierarchy. Showing a fierce determination for Togolese independence rarely seen in his fellow askari, Dadjo was born in 1914, too young to prove himself in the fires of the Weltkrieg, and spent his early career crushing bandit rebellions and catching petty criminals - a task he felt squandered his abilities and potential. With the ever-increasing destabilization and eventual collapse of Mittelafrika, however, Dadjo got his opportunity to shine as he mercilessly cut down agents of chaos and socialist revolutionaries who tried to seize on the initial waves of societal breakdown. Proving his loyalty and expertise, and his ability to be easily molded by his more senior advisors, Dadjo has become the Captain of the Togolesische Garde, and with the Olympio family’s hesitation to reinstate democracy, Dadjo once again stepped in to save Togo from chaos. Now, the young general and his National Reconciliation Committee lead Togo with an iron fist - republic without liberty under the safe watch of military rule."
POLITICS_SAVI_TOVE_DESC:0 "Jonathan Savi de Tové stands as the first native leader of a free Togoland, beating back German influence and the villainous Olympios. Born in 1895 in the city of Tové into the large Ewé ethnic group, Jonathan Savi rose to become a paramount chief within the Northern Coalition upon the passing of his father, and in his place has risen to become the main figure of this anti-Olympio alliance. Seeking to respect native customs and traditions while creating a truly democratic Togolese state, Jonathan Savi stands as the new father of our nation, and as one of the most respected men in Westafrika. Under his watch, [Root.getname] shall be freed from its past vices and brought into the modern age, all without losing what makes our peoples unique."
POLITICS_WALTER_DESC:0 "Walther von Wiese und Kaiserswaldau is a member of the famed Silesian noble family of the same name, hailing from Glatz and born in 1879. Coming to the colonies in order to continue his service to the Kaiser after his valorous acts during the Weltkrieg, Walther joined the Togolesische Garde and swiftly rose through its ranks - both in-part due to his skill and the stature of his noble birth. Overtime, he has come to command the Togolesische Garde as well as the wider Togolesische Kolonialbund, and now stands as the Kaiser’s right-hand in Togo. As the defender of the Kaiser’s favored African colony and the steward of German Togo, Walther stands as one of the last defenders of the Mittelafrikan dream. Though tied down heavily by the will of the local Togolese and Askari, Walther rules [ROOT.getname] with a velvet fist, eager to help the people of this paradise, but willing to do anything to ensure its survival."

TOG_stablizing_situation_desc:0 "While the rest of Africa is in the midst of anarchy, [Root.GetNameDefCap] stands as a tranquil island of peace.

TOG_military_rule:0 "General Dadjo Makes His Move"
TOG_military_rule_desc:0 "The Askari-dominated military under Kléber Dadjo have seen through the treachery and greed-fueled ambitions of the Olympio family, taking control over Lome and seizing the apparatus of state. [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] is in Dadjo’s hands now."
TOG_olyimpio:0 "The Olympios Stand Triumphant"
TOG_olyimpio_desc:0 "The Olympio family, headed by family patriarch Sylvanus and his aging father Octaviano, are among the richest groups in the nation, and the most influential. With their victory, the nation shall turn its back to Africa as it looks abroad for new ventures and opportunities to further profit [ROOT.GetNameDefCap], and themselves."
TOG_northern_alliance:0 "The Northern Alliance Secures Tradition"
TOG_northern_alliance_desc:0 "A coalition of tribal chieftains from the northern Togolese tribes working alongside various other political groups from across the region and even some remaining settlers tolerated by the natives, the Northern Alliance stands as the only real threat to the Olympio family’s dominance. With their victory, these lands shall know true democracy once and for all!"

TOG_reorganize_state:0 "Rebuild the Apparatus of State"
TOG_reorganize_state_desc:0 "Our nation lies in ruin, both physically and politically over the chaos of Mittelafrika’s collapse. Our state requires a new bureaucracy, a new framework, a new foundation in whole. Luckily, the Olympios built this nation up once, and they sure can do it again!"
TOG_taxation:0 "Greasing the Wheels of Power with Taxes"
TOG_taxation_desc:0 "A new state requires new funds! As we seek to rebuild our nation and government from the ground up, we must always find ways to pay for it, and the easiest source is from our own citizens. Taxes will be raised across the board, for [Root.GetNameDefCap] requires all the capital it can get to truly prosper."
TOG_imports_organize:0 "Togolese Tariffs"
TOG_imports_organize_desc:0 "The Olympio family have long been in the business of profiting off trade, and now as masters of [Root.GetNameDefCap], they have endeavored to do the same for the entire nation.

TOG_constitution_olyimpio:0 "A [Root.GetAdjective] Constitution"
TOG_constitution_olyimpio_desc:0 "A new constitution shall form the foundation for our new democratic system.

TOG_pacify_north:0 "Detente with Northern Lords"
TOG_pacify_north_desc:0 "We must approach the northern lords who control and dominate the Northern Alliance if we are to ever pass our more divisive policies and plans, for the Northern Alliance stands as the largest obstacle to our rule.

TOG_comitee_of_unity:0 "The Committee of Unity"
TOG_comitee_of_unity_desc:0 "With the northern lords largely pacified and made content, Sylvanus Olympio has persevered on this mission of goodwill, creating the Committee of Unity. Seeking to save face after his accusations of tyranny while also fostering a new national identity, this committee shall become the backbone of our new efforts to end the regional and ethnic rivalries that have long plagued our people."
TOG_just_good_business:0 "It's All Just Good Business"
TOG_just_good_business_desc:0 "Economic innovation and prosperity knows no bounds, no limits. Wealth can be stacked as high as you can pile it, and there is never enough to go around.

TOG_nigeria_trade_talks:0 "Trade Talks with the Entente"
TOG_nigeria_trade_talks_desc:0 "With our ties to Germany severed, we must reach out to the former masters of this Continent: the Entente. With the French nationalists in exile being so close by, it would be wise to conduct trade talks with them and their richer partners, the Canadians, to open the door to wider economic cooperation in the future."
TOG_outreach:0 "International Outreach and Global Economics"
TOG_outreach_desc:0 "With our rule secured and our ties with the Entente established, we must reach out to the other economic juggernauts of the world to earn their favor and business, for profit is the bottom line!

TOG_the_family_business:0 "The Family Business"
TOG_the_family_business_desc:0 "The Olympios have long been innovators and captains of industry and finance, and Sylvanus is no different. Under his rule, [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] has been transformed into a burgeoning economic power here on the Slave Coast. Under the Olympios, [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] shall stand proud and prosperous, finally freed from imperialist subjugation while now profiting off the greed that once oppressed our people."

TOG_exile_olyimpio:0 "Exile the Olympios"
TOG_exile_olyimpio_desc:0 "The Olympios have failed our people for the last time, and we will not allow their corruption and greed to taint our beautiful new democracy.

TOG_outreach_south:0 "Mend the Southern Schism"
TOG_outreach_south_desc:0 "Our regime is headed by the northern chiefs and lords that dominated Togolese politics before the rise of Westafrika and the Olympios. We must reconcile with the southern Ewe and Gen lords to fully unite our people to build our democratic dream together."

TOG_southern_notables:0 "Meet with Southern Notables and Nobles"
TOG_southern_notables_desc:0 "Our first round of negotiations with the southern chiefs failed miserably, with civil war nearly breaking out between the North and South.

TOG_constitution_northern:0 "The Federal Constitution"
TOG_constitution_northern_desc:0 "Our lands are home to varied tribes, peoples, cultures, and cliques. A federalized government is the best route to go to ensure all voices are heard while no cultures or mindsets are erased or ignored. Our new constitution shall reflect this federal nature, drawing heavily from the United State constitution and minorly from the Kaierreich’s to create a truly unique and form-fit governmental foundation for our unique nation."
TOG_cheiftan_autonomy:0 "Recognize Traditional Rights and Customs"
TOG_cheiftan_autonomy_desc:0 "The native tribes that still live by the ways of their ancestors, unsullied by the taint of imperialists and colonizers, should be respected by our new state. They are our citizens just like everyone else - an integral part of our nation, and their cultures and voices shall be heard."
TOG_united_togo:0 "A United and Cohesive [Root.getname]"
TOG_united_togo_desc:0 "Togo has long had many competing groups; from the time of the Ewe kingdoms to the Scramble of Africa, they have long competed for dominance. In these turbulent times, we must unite unlike ever before lest we face utter annihilation at the hands of the vile imperialists. Under the rule of the Northern Alliance, Togoland will stand triumphant!"
TOG_model_colony_model_republic:0 "A Model African Democracy"
TOG_model_colony_model_republic_desc:0 "Majority-rule democracies are a rare sight on the African continent, with the few native-led regimes being corrupted by the filth of Marxism or nationalist fervor. Here in Togo however, democracy reigns supreme. Here, the people’s voice is heard and obeyed, for only together as equals can we ever truly triumph."
TOG_fix_the_mess:0 "Repair Our Rails"
TOG_fix_the_mess_desc:0 "Our railroads have long laid in dilapidation and disrepair, destroyed in the fiery conflicts of our birth. These strips of wood and steel serve as our connection, our lifeline, to our neighbors and beyond.

TOG_republic_of_togo_desc:0 "We have come a long way from the disastrous failures of Westafrika and the German colonziers, but still we stand resolute and alive as the rest of Africa collapsed into chaos.

TOG_dadjo:0 "[Root.getname] Under Dadjo's Thumb"
TOG_dadjo_desc:0 "As shown by the collapse, democracy in Africa is doomed to fail, but our grand protector Kléber Dadjo will save us from the naive democrats and the German imperialists."
TOG_gather_support:0 "Build Up Dadjo's Inner Circle"
TOG_gather_support_desc:0 "Dadjo's great regime is still unsupported by many leaders in our government.

TOG_import_guns:0 "Black Market Arms Purchases"
TOG_import_guns_desc:0 "The army and our brave Askari are our last defense against the vile hordes that assault the corpse of Mittelafrika. While we might never be able to produce enough equipment for them, we have allies in the Entente that can for us!"
TOG_temporary_constitution:0 "A Pseudo Constitution"
TOG_temporary_constitution_desc:0 "’President’ Dadjo has decided that the best way to cement his control is to draft a new constitution; one which will protect the rights of all...but who is to say that we need to follow the exact wording."

TOG_gendarme_power_desc:0 "The Togolesische Garde are officially just an extra security force and legal militia, but with Dadjo's approval, we could change this.

TOG_coerce_northern_chiefs:0 "Coerce the Northern Chiefs"
TOG_coerce_northern_chiefs_desc:0 "The chieftains in the North have yet to accept our regime, desperately clinging to their so-called ‘Northern Alliance.’ Perhaps we could send the Garde to convince them of the futility of their resistance."
TOG_aquire_trucks:0 "Acquire New Modern Vehicles"

TOG_military_nation:0 "Dadjo's Military Fiefdom"
TOG_military_nation_desc:0 "Dadjo and the Togolesische Garde have secured their dominance over the Togo apparatus of state. Though many of their enemies still stalk the grass, waiting for their time to strike, Dadjo shall not give them the opportunity! Togo is strong and united finally after decades of imperialist domination, and this newfound freedom will not be lost so easily!"
TOG_restore_order:0 "Law and Order Above All Other Pursuits"
TOG_restore_order_desc:0 "Order and stability must be secured if our fledgling military ‘republic’ is to survive the coming storms. By the iron fist of Dadjo and the Garde, Togo shall ever persevere, and order shall reign over these once-broken lands, no matter the cost."

TOG_german_rule:0 "The Kaiser's Grip Holds Firm"
TOG_german_rule_desc:0 "Somehow, against all odds and the ever-increasing anti-German sentiment among the natives, the Kaiserreich's colonial regime here in Togoland has survived. Now it must walk the tightrope of stable governance as the wolves of opportunity nip at its heels all along the way."

TOG_cling_to_power_desc:0 "With Mittelafrika caught in the agony of its own death throes, our state stands as one of the last bastions of German rule here in Afrika.

TOG_cuck_to_natives:0 "Concessions to the Natives"
TOG_cuck_to_natives_desc:0 "If our administration is to survive here, massive concessions to the native population will have to be given to appease these ravenous locals. They shall be given equal treatment and rights to any German settler, equalizing Togolese society for the first time in modern history, while explicit action will be taken to repair our reputation with the native tribes of Togoland.

TOG_deals_with_chiefs:0 "Deal with the Chiefs"

TOG_contact_kamerun:0 "Contacts in Kamerun"
TOG_contact_kamerun_desc:0 "Kamerun exists as the closest bastion of German population on this accursed continent.

TOG_re_strat_arsenals_desc:0 "The Kaiserreich and it's more business-savvy settlers to our lands started to develop a native arms industry here before the collapse of Mittelafrika, centered around Lome and tapping into the local aluminum industry.

TOG_reverse_engineering:0 "Reverse Engineering Colonial Equipment"
TOG_reverse_engineering_desc:0 "The imperialists in their hurry left tons of unusable, still-functional military hardware and industrial technology lying around.

TOG_Kamina_Funkstation_desc:0 "The Kamina Funkstation was built in 1911 as a general-use radio station and music broadcasting tower, but it has fell into disrepair since the Weltkrieg and the Collapse.

It is time to bring in the noise and to bring in the funk!"
TOG_airforce:0 "The Air is Our Domain"
TOG_airforce_desc:0 "What was left of the German Military in Westafrika before the Tripartite Colony collapse was not much to behold, but luckily, the disgraced MAF defence forces stockpiled many old planes that we could use to bolster our military forces.

Nay, we shall not sit on our asses while the legacy of the Kaiserreich burns around us. We shall reclaim the destiny of our empire and restoire Mittelafrika to its former glory!"

togo.1.d:0 "Sylvanus Olympio is one of the richest men in all of Westafrika. A proud statesman and scholar from Togo’s esteemed Olympio family, his family’s wealth rivals that of some of even the Kaiserreich’s own Junker houses, and with it comes a great deal of influence. In the final moments of a ‘unified’ Mittelafrika, Olympio has come forth with an interesting proposal: he wishes to purchase the entirety of the Westafikan colony. With Mittelafrika’s implosion and the recent economic disaster, the colony is far from profitable, and Olmpyio’s offer is rather generous to say the least. Though we would lose access to much of the wealth the colony theoretically could output, just selling it now could prove cheaper in the long run, as reforming Westafrika could easily prove too costly to be worth it. What shall we say to Mr. Olympio’s offer?"
togo.1.a:0 "We have no options left"
togo.1.b:0 "Westafrika will hold through!"

togo.2.t:0 "Olympio’s Takeover"
togo.2.d:0 "Sylvanus Olympio has seized the apparatus of state from the German colonial regime, taking control over Westafrika in its entirety as he and his closest associates and allies scramble to assemble a provisional government. This new ramshackle repulbican regime shall guide this newly free nation on the rocky road towards successful native rule. However, with Olympio’s growing ambitions becoming ever more apparent to all, not all in the nation believe that this ‘provisional’ government will be as temporary as promised. In the meantime, the colonists and settlers once adored by the old regime now quake in their boots as they await to see how the new majority rule government will treat them, with many settlers already packing up and leaving our shores to return to Europe or to escape to still-loyal colonies throughout the last pockets of colonial rule still left in Africa."
togo.2.a:0 "The days of German Imperialism are numbered!"

togo.3.t:0 "Elections Promised"
togo.3.d:0 "With weeks having now passed since the ascension of Olympio’s provisional government, the political scene of our lands have begun to quiet down. The main political establishment, mainly comprised of Togolese politicians who were favored by the former German government and allowed to amass exorbitant fortunes under German rule, has largely fallen into line behind the Olympio family and Sylvanus, while their main opposition has emerged in what has been dubbed the ‘Northern Alliance’ - a broad coalition of various political groups, rival families, and even a few remaining colonialists who have rallied around Jonathan Savi de Tové and who all share one thing in common: their disdain for the Olympio family’s dominance. With the stage now set, Olympio has promised for the eventual arrival of democracy as the people clamor more and more every day for our first free elections to be held..."
togo.3.a:0 "...but when!?"

togo.4.t:0 "People Demand Elections"
togo.4.d:0 "The political stage of our fledgling nation has been set for some time now, and the people have grown anxious over the provisional government’s apparent lack of urgency to bring about the promised elections. Olympio sits within the halls of the former German colonial mansion, plotting away and scheming over his ambitions and desires as the people of our state cry for their voices to be heard. With the situation beginning to reach a tipping point, many of Olympio’s advisors have cautioned him to start the new election process sooner rather than later, but the ultimate decision is up to the man himself."
togo.4.a:0 "Hold the elections, the people are ready."
togo.4.b:0 "Hold off on the elections for now, we are not stable enough yet."

togo.5.t:0 "Demands Grow Louder"
togo.5.d:0 "The people are in an uproar throughout the nation as the demand for elections has reached a fever pitch. Despite the people’s cries and pleas for true democracy, Sylvanus Olmypio has continued to delay his promise to his people, and now our newly-freed state teeters on the brink of chaos and collapse. It would be wise for Olmpyio to start the election process immediately, for even though his chances of winning have likely all been destroyed now, at least it might keep the flame of freedom and democracy alive here on the Slave Coast, for the military has grown increasingly agitated over Olympio’s flippant disregard for the people’s will, and rumors have spread that if elections aren’t held soon, the proud Askari may be forced to play their hand."
togo.5.b:0 "We must listen to their pleas and these rumors. Hold the elections!"
togo.5.a:0 "Delay more! We can still fix this!"

togo.6.t:0 "The Military Overthrows Olympio"
togo.6.d:0 "Sylvanus Olympio, whether through greed, blinding ambition, or foolishness, has killed our democracy before it ever truly began. Due to his blatant disregard to the people’s voice and his evermore apparent tyrannical disposition, the proud Askari led by Kléber Dadjo have seized control over the apparatus of state and now seek to stabilize the chaotic nightmare that has become politics within our nation. Our nation and our lifeblood shall be safe and secure under Dadjo!"
togo.6.a:0 "Dadjo is the captain now."

togo.7.t:0 "The First Elections"
togo.7.d:0 "Finally giving in to popular demand and making good on his promise, Sylvanus Olmypio has stepped down as provisional president to make way for the first free elections here on the Slave Coast. With tensions high and the competition fierce, the outcome is anyone’s guess, but the two main candidates are Olmpyio on his platform of rampant economic development under a free-market system, and the Northern Alliance led by Savi de Tové, leading the wide coalition of anti-Olympians who seek to create a fair, free democratic federation. After decades of waiting, months of campaigning, and a whole day of voting and counting, the results are in, and the winner is..."
togo.7.a:0 "...Sylvanus Olympio!"

togo.8.t:0 "The [GHA.GetNameDefCap] Question"
togo.8.d:0 "[GHA.GetNameDefCap] lies vulnerable in the chaos of Mittelafrika’s collapse. We could potentially strike this all-to-easy foe, allowing us to quickly and exponentially increase the land we have under our control. However, such a violent act will likely cause more trouble than its worth, and so a peace option has also been proposed. In it, we would offer the Ashanti regime a route to peaceful unification if they agreed. What shall we do?"
togo.8.a:0 "We will not bend to their possible demands. War!"
togo.8.b:0 "A peaceful solution can be reached."

togo.9.t:0 "Togo Proposes Unification"
togo.9.d:0 "A request has come from the regime in Lome suggesting peaceful unification in these troubled times. We could surrender our sovereignty in the pursuit of Westafrican unity, or we could deny these fools as opportunistic hounds come to seal away our independence. Though with more and more chaos spreading in the wake of Mittelafrika’s demise, it might not be a bad idea."
togo.9.a:0 "In the interest of security, we accept."
togo.9.b:0 "You have to be joking. Didn’t Westafrican unity just fail?"

togo.10.t:0 "[GHA.GetNameDefCap] Agrees"
togo.10.d:0 "The wise ruling regime of [GHA.GetNameDefCap] has agreed to our proposal of unification. Our two nations shall become one in the interest of Westafrican peace and stability."
togo.10.a:0 "One people, one goal, one need."

togo.11.t:0 "[GHA.GetNameDefCap] Denies Our Request"
togo.11.d:0 "The foolish ruling regime of [GHA.GetNameDefCap] has denied our proposal of unification. In the wake of their short-signed denial, we can either accept their decision and turn our sights elsewhere, or ride into Accra and destroy these Akkan dogs."
togo.11.a:0 "We march for Accra!"
togo.11.a:0 "Fine. If they don’t want us, we don’t need them."

togo.12.t:0 "Demands from Togo"
togo.12.d:0 "The tiny former-Westafrikan state of Togoland has petitioned our government for some of their claimed lands to be returned to their hands, claiming to not only be the rightful heirs of Deutschwestafrika, but also the true and rightful suzerin over the people this region and the lands of the Bight of Biafra. Should we give up these largely worthless lands to these desperate Africans, or shall we deny them utterly and completely. If we do agree, we could potentially milk them for quite a decent fee given their reputation as one of the only profitable portions of the now-defunct Mittelafrika."
togo.12.a:0 "We shall never endanger our territorial integrity!"
togo.12.b:0 "We accept, but they shall pay a heavy price."
togo.12.c:0 "Yes, fine. It is just some strips of trees and sand."

togo.14.t:0 "Our Price"
togo.14.d:0 "With our decision to demand concessions from the Togolese, we must now decide how heavy of a price to levy on them. We could simply demand economic concessions, baking on their reputation as a rich and profitable former-colony. On the other end entirely, we could demand their regime’s subjugation and subservience to our own. For a middle road approach that would likely not offend theri delegation nor undersell the importance of an opportunity in this deal, we could demand their entrance into the Entente, solidifying our control over them indirectly as allies. What shall we do?"
togo.14.a:0 "Puppet their government!"
togo.14.b:0 "Force them to join the Entente."
togo.14.c:0 "Demand mere economic concessions."

togo.15.t:0 "An Expected Response"
togo.15.d:0 "The French regime in Algiers has denied our request, shunning our government’s desire to reclaim our rightful lands. We must now decide to either live with the bitter taste of denial and defeat, or we can desperately invade the French goliath, though how far we will get before their war machine turns its attention to us is uncertain to say the least."
togo.15.a:0 "We can not possibly win. We must move on."
togo.15.b:0 "War is the only way."

togo.16.t:0 "A Surprising Response"
togo.16.d:0 "The French administration has surprisingly fully accepted our territorial demands, shocking our government and the nation, who had come to expect some sort of payment or even war to come as a response. With this easy anwer, a sigh of relief has been heard across Togoland, for our people would be united without a drop of blood or an ounce of gold wasted."
togo.16.a:0 "We mend the schisms of colonialism this day."

togo.17.t:0 "An Agreeable Response"
togo.17.d.puppet:0 "The French government has agreed to our demands, but only if we allow their government to exert large amounts of control over our own. Is more land really worth giving up our hard fought sovereignty to another imperialist power?"
togo.17.d.entente:0 "The French government has agreed to our demands, but only if we join their military alliance, the Entente. Is risking war with the Syndicalist powers or our former masters worth a few hundred square miles of land?"

togo.18.t:0 "A New Idea Realized"
togo.18.d:0 "The various peoples of West Africa, from the Pepper Coast of Liberia to the Slave Coast of Central Africa, have long been subjected to the whims of imperialists, colonizers, capitalists, and nationalists all seeking to devour the lifeblood of our bountiful and pristine eden out here on the so-called ‘Slave Coasts.’ However, with our rule over these lands and our victories of the former slave drivers of these lands, West Africa has been saved. From the ashes of the old Westafikan order now rises the West African Federation, West Africa’s first modern attempt at a fair and free democracy after the corrupt failure of Liberia. Now, under the rule of [Root.GetLeader] and with the ideals of democracy and liberty under our wings, our newly forged nation shall take flight into our newly ordained destiny."
togo.18.a:0 "Work, Liberty, Homeland!"

togo.19.t:0 "An Old Idea Revived"
togo.19.d:0 "Despite all that has assailed it, all the obstacles and hurdles it has reached and surmounted, Westafika somehow stands once more as a united and (somewhat) stable state. WIth the victory of the German regime in Togoland, the legacy of the Kaiser’s favorite model colony continued, and now, despite nigh-insurmountable odds, [Root.GetLeader] and his pro-German, Askari backed regime have resecured the lost lands of their Kaiser’s Afrika on the Slave Coast. With this victory, Germany’s rule has been reestablished over at least one section of the now-devastated Mittelafrikan project. What the future will hold for this German regime, none can say, but for now, the victorious chants of the Krauts and their Askari have drowned out any doubt that German rule in Afrika, or atleast Westafrika, is here to stay."
togo.19.a:0 "Heia! Heia Safari!"

togo.20.t:0 "The Faith of the Natives"
togo.20.d:0 "The convoy pulled into the village once more for the third time this month; the children being the most eager for the goodies the soldiers bring while the elders moved slowly to greet them. It was proud in the beginning - the flags on our vehicle's hoods fluttering proudly in what seemed to be sunny, carefree days. Now, the lieutenant thought the sky couldn’t be anymore gray as he sat in the passenger seat of the Opel Blitz that was entering this village once more. Some of the askari accompanying him were eager as well for they came from this area, if not some even from the village. The lieutenant wasn’t as eager; the grizzled veteran just thinking of his sour attitude as that of someone who didn't like the ride, but he had a truer reason deep inside. The reason the convoy was delivering food and farming tools was not out of generosity or any other kind reason, but for the simple fact the smiling elders held the German lieutenant and the government as a whole by the balls. Every time they delivered food, the elders would end up praising the German government as friends and saviors, only later to go back on their word and demand payment for minor inconveniences that they would say “threatened” their status as a sovereign village of Togoland. The lieutenant didn’t even bother to get out to greet the elders this time, not wishing to put up the facade of friendship that he knew they held no bounds to."
togo.20.a:0 "Whatever makes them stay happy, right?"

togo.21.t:0 "A Motley Crew"
togo.21.d:0 "The group that has become known as the ‘Northern Chiefs’ is a varied and vast group of anti-colonial and anti-Olympio parties, chiefs, councils, and more all banded together to stave off the eagle-eyed ambitions of Sylvanus Olympio. Headed by the northern chiefs and lords of the Moba, Kpan, Lamba, Tchamaba, Tembe, and Kabre tribes, this varied group holds in its ranks a wide array of ideological slants from liberal idealists and reformists to conservative traditionalists and nationalists. Their main opponent to their legitimacy has been staving off the rising Socialist influence from  the Togolese People’s Movement, who have long sought to infiltrate our ever-broadening coalition in order to subvert our rule in their twisted pursuit of some impossible ideal. These varied representatives stand as the last bastion between our young republic and the vicious wolves that seek to tear us down or lead us into corruption and decadent tyranny. We must stand resolute, for democracy is the only way Togo can be free!"
togo.21.a:0 "What an odd assortment of characters."

togo.22.t:0 "The Young Captain’s Secret"
togo.22.d:0 "Kléber Dadjo may be the charismatic face of the new Togolese state, but he is far from the only power within the nation. He has been on strings, made to dance for the public as the real masters of Togo rule from the shadows. Dadjo’s young, moldable mind has been shaped by the Askari old guard who now use the young Captain of the Togolesische Garde as a buffer between themselves and the public. Though Dadjo rallies against this oppressive force when he can, he is far too entrenched to deviate too greatly from the party line towed by these secret masters of the Garde."
togo.22.a:0 "A puppet by any other name."

togo.23.t:0 "A Death in the Family"
togo.23.d:0 "It was a cool, crisp morning in the shining city of Lome. The local hammerkop trilled their chittering calls as the waves of the Atlantic crashed into the white sandy shores of this pristine African paradise. The sun was just beginning to peek out over the crest of Mount Agou, and all seemed peaceful and serene as the darkness of the previous night gave way to the orange and pink glow of the rising star - a beautiful day to die, Octaviano thought to himself as he laid in his bed, slowly succumbing to the ravages of old age that had ensnared his once virile and lively body. \n\nOctaviano once ruled as the patriarch of the Olympio family, forging Togo to his own will as he worked tirelessly for decades to build up his family’s newly adopted home. Under his watch, Lome has grown to become the envy of the Slave Coast, Togo has achieved independence from the imperialists at long last, and his kin rule over the upper echelons of Togolese society - a well spent and fulfilling life, most would agree. Now with his many, many children provided for and his nephew ruling the nation and family in his stead, this aging hero can let go, knowing full well that his legacy will be honored and his people safe in his absence. \n\nNow, Octaviano can bask in the warmth of his accomplishments and storied life as the cold, sweet embrace of death wraps over him. A truer Togolese has never existed!"
togo.23.a:0 "Goodnight, sweet prince."

togo.24.t:0 "The Rebirth of Mittelafrika"
togo.24.d:0 "With our decision to ride forth from our paradise in Lome, we have crusaded long and hard across the Dark Continent in order to reclaim the fallen glory of the burning German Empire. After much bloodshed and sacrifice, we have climbed the pile of corpses we have amassed around us, beating all odds, and have restored the borders of Mittelafrika. Now, with a new capital center being built in Togo in order to better control this re-birthed colony patchwork, the newly promoted Staathalter [TOG.GetLeader] has declared that Mittelafrika has been reborn, and from our new center of power in Lome, we shall better guide Mittelafrika into a more stable future. One free from the ailments that once plagued the old order."
togo.24.a:0 "The Iron Cross of the Kaiserreich Rises over Africa once more!"

togo.25.t:0 "A Splendid Vacation"
togo.25.d:0 "With the sun shining down upon him and with the ocean waves lapping against the shoreline, Kaiser Wilhelm lounged and tanned underneath the Togolese sun. Accompanied by his beloved wife as well as his prized only daughter, the Kaiser took in the majesty and peacefulness of Togoland - his favorite colony in all the Kaiserreich. Coming to his private estate in the capital of Lome whenever he got the chance, the Kaiser adored this tiny slice of Germany-in-Afrika that his subjects have so delicately created. All around him stood buildings constructed in a mixture of German and Togolese architectural styles as German-speaking servants brought him schnitzel and Bavarian beer along with local dishes such as Fufu, Koklo meme, Kokonte, Akpan, and even the locally vinted red wine. The Kaiser’s Pearl in Afrika always did their best to serve their visiting sovereign, and while he was here, Willy was always treated like a true royal - ever pleasing the notoriously pompous emperor. Though this vacation cannot last forever, and within a few days he and his family would be forced to return to Berlin, these Hohenzollerns did not worry, for all they could focus on right now was the tropical bliss they found themselves in."
togo.25.a:0 "May His Grace enjoy the paradise we have built here in his name."

togo.26.t:0 "The Pearl of Mittelafrika Stands Strong Under German Rule..."
togo.26.d:0 "...or does it? It is hard to say who truly rules Togoland anymore, for since the fall of Mittelafrika, German rule all across the continent has faltered and fallen, and that reality is no different even here in the Pearl of Mittelafrika. Heavily Germanized and settled, Togoland is one of the bastions of German influences, or was, along with Dar-Es-Salaam, Kamerun, and Südwestafrika, but this has all changed in the wake of the Collapse. Now, German rule barely holds on even here, but despite all odds, the colonial order still holds true. \n\nHeavily propped up by both Berlin and our allies among the German remnants, Togoland is a small island of German influence floating among a sea of chaos and savagery, and yet it is not the Germans themselves that keep this atmosphere of peace within our borders. That honor falls to the Askari, who both outnumber and out gun the colonials at this point. Under the watch of these Germanized African veterans, Togoland is kept safe and secure as they prop up the colonial regime for their own benefit. Using the support from the wider Kaiserreich, the Askari are slowly bending Togoland to their own will, transforming it into a state of their own liking. This informal military rule cares for the varied peoples of Togoland while maintaining law and order at all costs in a populist caretaker stratocracy. Under their leadership, Togoland shall prosper, and the colonial remnants in Lome are allowed to masquerade as the still-all powerful lords of this ‘colony.'"
togo.26.a:0 "'Colonial' command held by the balls by their Askari enforcers."

togo.27.t:0 "Westafrika’s Own Rockefeller"
togo.27.d:0 "Sylvanus Olympio, new patriarch of the Olympio family and new Chancellor of Togoland, stands as one of the richest men in Afrika. As such, he commands a vast amount of both wealth and respect, as well as great disdain from many within the nation who see him as a traitor to traditional beliefs and a puppet of foreign economies. Denying these rumors and seeking to follow in the footsteps of his famed uncle Octaviano, Sylvanus has begun to pick up where the former patriarch of the Sylvanus family started. Resuming Octaviano’s plan to modernize Lome, Sylvanus has taken this a step further. Using his own exorbitant wealth accumulated from both his family’s and his own fortunes, Chancellor Sylvanus seeks to fully modernize and westernize all of Togoland, starting with its main urban centers. New public works projects, infrastructure plans, clean water initiatives, reformed Western-style education systems and more shall be brought to all within Togoland, all funded by Sylvanus and his family. Under his Chancellorship, Togoland shall be dragged into modernity by Sylvanus, even if he must do so while the Northern Chiefs kick and scream and throw their tantrums, for progress and prosperity waits for no man!"
togo.27.a:0 "Praise be to the modern Midas of Togo."

togo.29.t:0 "The Love of Gold Guides Us"
togo.29.d:0 "Afrika is full of fortunate sons and lavishly rich families and individuals, but two titans of economic excess stand above all their fellow Africans as the richest non-royals on the continent - Sylvanus Olympio and Moïse Tshombe. With Tshome hailing from Katanga and Olympio hailing from Togoland, the two live and operate hundreds of miles away from each other, and yet they have become fast friends in this post-Collapse world. Frequently flying or sailing to one another’s estates to discuss new capitalistic ventures, going into new business deals together, or simply just coming together to enjoy their opulent and obscene levels of wealth together, these two men stand as the golden golds of Afrika. Though their greed and shared love for beautiful women have each caused their own grievances, their friendship has always stayed strong, forever solidified by their shared love of money. With Africa in the hands of these captains of industry and others like them, perhaps true prosperity can really be brought here to illuminate this Dark Continent."
togo.29.a:0 "Two friends, separated by hundreds of miles, joined together by their love of cash."

togo.30.t:0 "Mending the Schisms that Divide Us"
togo.30.d:0 "With the electoral win of the Northern Chiefs under our new Chancellor Jonathan Savi de Tové, Togoland shall endeavor to remove the traitorous influence of the Olympios and their colonial allies, for it was these groups that have led Togoland astray from tradition. Colonial rule galvanized our national identity, but divided us between pro and anti-colonial forces that, when coupled with our centuries-long struggle with regionalist tensions, have nearly sundered our nation in two. By returning to tradition, reviving our unique and varied cultures, and by respecting the wishes of both those in the cities and those in the hinterlands, we shall create a newly united and cohesive Togo unlike ever before seen. Under Chancellor Savi de Tové, Togoland shall truly heal as we grow to become one nation."
togo.30.a:0 "Under Chancellor Savi, the nation shall heal."

togo.31.t:0 "Democracy Under the Big Tent"
togo.31.d:0 "Under Chancellor Jonathan Savi de Tové’s administration, the Coalition of Northern Chiefs has been maintained. This grand coalition of various democratic and tribalist elements has stuck together so that we may better combat the various influences that seek to undermine our rule, whether it be from the colonial remnants, the latent Socialist movement, or even the Olympios from abroad in their exile. In order to fight this influence, our coalition shall stand together. However, to still bring full, free, and varied representative democracy to our people, factionalism and sub-parties have been allowed to organize within our big tent, pushing democracy to flourish and for thought to diversify in this new, stable, and fair environment. Though no single faction is anywhere near large enough to usurp the dominance of the Northern Chiefs, this step towards republican democracy has instilled a great amount of trust and joy within our people, who are finally beginning to feel heard for the first time in their lives. Under the Northern Chiefs and their coalition, Chancellor Savi de Tové shall slowly guide Togoland to a fair and free future."
togo.31.a:0 "Though the Coalition stands, the people are not without choice."

togo.32.t:0 "The Togolesische Garde’s Facade"
togo.32.d:0 "Kléber Dadjo, despite his young age and his position as a puppet to the Askari shadow council, commands a great deal of authority over the nation - at least outwardly in the public’s eye. Under Dadjo, Togoland has been transformed into a virtual police state, where only the Black remnants of the colonial Togolesische Garde have any power or say. With the upper hierarchy of the nation occupied entirely by military and police officers, the rest of the nation lies shackled under a facade civilian government - a puppet on the end of Dadjo’s strings which he plays to amuse himself and control the public’s attention while his true masters within the Togolesische Garde control Togo from the shadow. The military is entirely within control, and martial law has stood nationwide since Dadjo’s ascension. The ‘constitution’ imposed by the civilian government is useless, and writes the Togolesische Garde a blank cheque to do as they please. Togoland under Dadjo has become nothing more than a military fiefdom - a common fate for nations trying to survive post-Collapse."
togo.32.a:0 "A sham government protected by a dictator in all but name."

togo.33.t:0 "Securing Our Foundations"
togo.33.d:0 "With the son high in the sky beaming down sweltering rays and creating a muggy, humid atmosphere, Kléber Dadjo and his retinue sweat profusely and heaved heavily in the thick, water-logged air as they went about their dark task. Burying the dead, even in shallow graves, was no light task, and the Afrikan heat only made such labors harder. Throwing bodies by the dozens into a hastily dug mass-grave filled with lye and decaying remains, Dadjo’s men worked dutifully as their young commander looked on. These soon-to-be-buried corpses were just the newest dead in a long list of souls that had paid the ultimate price for their treachery against Togoland and her new regime. Whether they were Socialist raiders from Ghana, rogue colonial remnants, members of the Northern Chief’s coalition, or simply just civilians who had gotten in the way, it mattered not now. The traitors were dead, and not one of their allies, and that is all that mattered to Dadjo and his men. Only the Olympios and Dadjo’s own men within the Togolesische Garde were exempt from these raids, for his men serve him well and the Olympios pay quite handsomely and regularly for their continued protection. All others are not exempt, their lives can be erased in a flash, for anyone deemed a traitor by Dadjo is certainly marked as a dead man."

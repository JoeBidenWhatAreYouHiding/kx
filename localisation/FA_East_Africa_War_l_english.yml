east_africa_war.1.t:0 "Horror"
east_africa_war.1.d:0 "Emil Maurice had served Admiral Heydrich for many years, dutifully standing by this madman as the world seemingly turned against him. With each accusation hurled against Heydrich, Muarice stood firm and weathered the storm with his companion, entirely unaware of the beast that lurked within. Heydrich was an expert at covering his tracks, and despite all of Madagascar writhing in pain under Heydrich’s rule, the simple Maurice was none the wiser, kept in the dark by Heydrich as he continued his reign of terror. \n\nHowever, not all secrets can last, and with Heydrich growing more desperate and more ravenous, his guard and his facade began to drop. This came to a head when Maurice, who had just chauffeured Heydrich to yet another one of his secretive meetings, discovered the truth. Waiting for Heydrich to finish, Maurice began to tinker with his automobile, checking each surface and compartment of the car until he found a small envelope left by Heydrich in the glove box. Already opened, Maruice decided to glance at the documents he had found, but what he expected to be a simple itinerary plan turned out to be much more incriminating. \n\nMaurice had found just a few sheets of paper, but on those sheets was the power to topple all Heydrich’s regime with nothing but a word. The documents not only outlined harsh quotas for the island’s labourers to fulfill, but also held a tally of all the workers Heydrich ordered to be killed this month, their names numbering in the thousands. Accompanying these stats were pictures of some of the labour camps that dotted the island - metallic and machine filled death camps fronted as labor centers and worker’s quarters - as well as page after page of damning evidence that showed an entirely different light on Heydrich in Maurice’s eyes. For too long, Maurice had allowed himself to be a useful idiot, and now the frantic mind of this horrified chauffeur began to race and spin in circles, driving him to near panic. Quickly stashing all the documents he had found back where he left them, Maurice awaited Heydrich to finish his meeting, keeping the car running as he always did. As the meeting finished and the two began to drive back to the capital, Heydrich remarked that Maruice looked pale, almost as if he saw a ghost. White-knuckled and sweating, Maurice plainly said that he has just seen a group of predatory fossas prowling through the jungle nearby, and was merely caught off-guard. Heydrich laughed at his cowardly friend, driving off into the distance as Maurice suppressed his inner-turmoil."
east_africa_war.1.a:0 "An awkward and nerve-wracking drive home."

east_africa_war.2.t:0 "Fury"
east_africa_war.2.d:0 "With the treachery and beastliness of Heydrich now plain to see in Maurice’s eyes, the poor chauffeur was in a constant state of panic cycling with rage. Unable to run to Dar-Es-Salaam given Heydrich’s many allies there that would likely stop Maurice along the way, Maurice was left with few options and fewer allies to turn to. He could trust next to no one, and he began to fear that Heydrich knew something was amiss, for it had been a few weeks since that fateful car ride and Maurice had not been himself since. Plotting plan after failed plan and trying to come to any sound conclusion he could think of, Maurice finally landed on the only thing he could think of that could save Madagascar and its people. Though such an act would be immensely difficult and require a great deal of planning and luck, Maurice now knew what he had to do to save his new island home..."
east_africa_war.2.a:0 "...Maurice must kill The Beast!"

east_africa_war.3.t:0 "A Demand for the Beast"
east_africa_war.3.d:0 "With Heydrich having run-off to the colonial fiefdom of Goeringia, Maurice has been left in charge of the Madagaskar colony. Seeking revenge and justice, Maurice has sent a demand to Göring that asked for Heydrich’s immediate release into Maruice’s custody. However, though Maurice thought Göring would oblige him without issue, Göring instead simply told the glorified chauffeur to simply get lost, for Goeringia and its new master bows to no man - whether they be the Kaiser or anyone else. With this denial, Maurice has steeled himself to bring these traitors to justice, but how he would do so he was still trying to figure out."
east_africa_war.3.a:0 "It would seem that Heydrich has friends in high places."

east_africa_war.4.t:0 "To Save Mittelafrika..."
east_africa_war.4.d:0 "With Göring’s refusal to hand Heydrich over to the Kaiserreich’s authorities, Emil Maurice decided that the time for diplomacy was over - now was the time for war. Goeringia had become the new black heart of a movement seeking to seize the dying corpse of Mittelafrika for themselves, with Göring and Heydrich at the helm. To combat this dangerous dynamic duo, Maurice resolved himself to tear out this dark heart and save the German colonial mission in Africa while also bringing salvation to the millions of downtrodden natives that have been trampled beneath the ambitions of these madmen and traitors."
east_africa_war.4.a:0 "...we must rip out its Black Heart."

east_africa_war.5.t:0 "The Rise of the Anti-Göring Pact"
east_africa_war.5.d:0 "Plotting against the might of Göring and Heydrich has been no easy task, and with many of his old allies in the German command now joining these traitors, Maurice has been left with few friends to turn to. In order to stand a fighting chance in the coming war for Mittelafrika’s soul, Maurice has determined that he will need allies. Luckily for this glorified chauffeur, there is no shortage of new states in the post-Collapse setting that would love a chance to take down Göring and his maddening fiefdom. Officially forging the ‘Anti-Göring Pact,’ Maurice now must send word to these various states in order to build an alliance strong enough and united enough to take down Göring and Heydrich once and for all."
east_africa_war.5.a:0 "Goeringia shall fall by our hands!"

east_africa_war.6.t:0 "An Invitation to the Slaughter"
east_africa_war.6.d:0 "Emil Maurice of the Madagaskar colony has reached out to us with an interesting proposal. Offering assistance and amnesty for the violence and chaos that has erupted during the Collapse, Maurice begs for assistance in his coming crusade against the mad fiefdom known as Goeringia. With this temporary alliance, our states would work together to crush Göring and Heydrich, wiping these two madmen from the Earth and destroying their sick playground in its entirety. Though we shall have to spill some of our own blood to do so, we cannot hope to take Göring on alone, and so we have little choice but to accept this temporary alliance. By our hands, Goeringia shall fall."
east_africa_war.6.a:0 "We shall rip and tear until Goeringia is no more."

east_africa_war.7.t:0 "A Strange Meeting"
east_africa_war.7.d:0 "Meeting on the border of their two fiefdoms, the grand Mzee Onyango Obama and the lord of Goeringia Hermann Göring discussed the current climate of post-Collapse Mittelafrika. Both of these men held their own ambitions separate from that of the old colonial order or the Kaiser, and have both found themselves at war with the vast majority of their neighbors. Sensing that cooperation may be the only path forward for either of them, these two titans of Afrika begrudgingly met to discuss the possibility of temporarily aiding one another in the coming struggle. As the two drank tea and smoke from their pipes, the room they were meeting in filled with smoke and the chattering of some dark deal being made. At any one moment, these negotiations could easily break down, but these two men are far from fools, and have tried to keep their composure as best they can. With the meeting concluded, the two rose from their seats and exited the tent they were in on opposite sides, each walking back to their respective camps. As Göring reached his men, he exclaimed to them the nature of the meeting and how it went, who all sat around waiting for their lord, ready to witness whether or not a deal could be struck."
east_africa_war.7.a:0 "The Mzee would never work with these White Devils."
east_africa_war.7.b:0 "The enemy of my enemy is my friend, or so it would seem."

east_africa_war.8.t:0 "A Moment of Opprotunity"
east_africa_war.8.d:0 "With the collapse of Mittelafrika, much of this continent has been thrown into chaos, with wars and conflicts breaking out all around us. This has caused much bloodshed and death, but has also opened a doorway for us, should we have the balls to just reach out and open it. To the South, the vile Mau-Mau wage war against our neighbor of Somalia, who long has occupied rightfully Ethiopian land. With our old foe distracted and their backs turned, now would be the perfect time to reclaim the Ogaden and our lost lands. Shall we spring this trap, or simply sit back and watch as Africa burns?"
east_africa_war.8.a:0 "Strike while they are preoccupied!"
east_africa_war.8.a:0 "We cannot risk getting dragged into this continent-spanning war."

east_africa_war.9.t:0 "Thick as Thieves"
east_africa_war.9.d:0 "Sensing that his back is against the wall, Göring has begun to frantically look for allies to aid him in his quest to make his own fiefdom from the corpse of Mittelafrika, and he has just found the perfect companion. To the south, Hans Huttig lords over Nordrhodesien with an iron first, crushing both natives and Anglos under his boot. This madman, like Göring, holds no real loyalty to the Kaiser or his throne, and as such would likely be a perfect ally to aid Göring in his quest. Reaching out to Huttig, the two have come together and drafted a new accord, signifying that along with Heydrich, these two titans of the old Mittelafrikan regime refuse to bow to others any longer. Together, they would carve out their own destiny in this war-torn Dark Continent."
east_africa_war.9.a:0 "Together, we shall bend Afrika to our will."

east_africa_war.10.t:0 "Dissolution of the Accord"
east_africa_war.10.d:0 "As the war has dragged on, Göring has come to view his new allies with disgust. His cooperation with the Mau-Mau has bore fruit, but has also caused more trouble than it was worth, with the Mzee now holding deep sway over many natives within our borders. Worse yet, Hans Huttig has proven to be an incomepetent fool, barely able to control his own troops let alone the vast swathes of land he lords over. With the failures and drawbacks of these new allies clear, Göring has moved to dissolve their accord, casting these two adrift in the sea of chaos that has come to consume all of post-Collapse Mittelafrika. With much of Huttig’s own troops falling in with Göring’s clique, the lord of Nordrhodesien is powerless to stop us, and the Mzee’s day of reckoning will come soon enough. Göring needs no allies or friends, for all he needs is power."
east_africa_war.10.a:0 "It’s all just good business."

east_africa_war.11.t:0 "The Askari Have Had Enough"
east_africa_war.11.d:0 "With the war dragging on for far too long, the local Askari of Goeringia have begun to openly defy Göring’s will, despite many of them once serving under this madman. Across Goeringia, Askari and other native soldiers or rabble have risen up, declaring open revolt against Göring’s failing regime. This has done much to destabilize the already fragile fiefdom, while also causing Göring to lose much of his manpower base. If this revolt cannot be put down soon, it would seem that Göring’s days truly are numbered."
east_africa_war.11.a:0 "It seems even the Deutsch-Afrikans themselves tire of this game"

east_africa_war.12.t:0 "Forced Back to Our Island"
east_africa_war.12.d:0 "Despite our best intentions and the intentions of Maurice, we have lost in our struggle to bring Göring and Heydrich to justice. All of our mainland allies and possessions have been crushed, and we are once again exiled to our island. Though we are safe here, at least for now, we have no way to continue the fight with Goeringia, and as such have sued for peace. Ceding all of our mainland holdings to Göring’s fiefdom, Madagascar is one again cast adrift, both without allies and without support. Now, only time will tell if Maurice can maintain his grip here, or will Madagascar finally be free of German colonial rule once and for all?"
east_africa_war.12.a:0 "It seems we have failed this day."

east_africa_war.14.t:0 "The Black Heart Excised"
east_africa_war.14.d:0 "Despite facing insurmountable odds and a far superior force, we have somehow been proven victorious over the forces of Göring, Heydrich, and Huttig. These madmen have been cast out, their fiefdoms torn down, and their crimes against humanity revealed to the wider world. Though Africa is far from safe and secure, it can now develop and sort itself out in relative peace, finally free of these madmen and their burning ambitions."
east_africa_war.14.a:0 "Now comes the labors of recovery."

east_africa_war.15.t:0 "The Formation of the Anti-Göring Pact"
east_africa_war.15.d:0 "In the chaos that followed the fall of Mittelafrika, a good part of East Africa fell under the control of the ever-determined Von Göring, who established his personal stronghold in Goeringia and who, in addition to basing a good part of his economy on drug trafficking, did not hide his expansionist intentions. In this enterprise, he was joined by his loyal lackeys, among them his right-hand man, Admiral Reinhard Heydrich, former governor of Madagascar, who left the island after the fall of Mittelafrika. Few people seemed to have the courage to oppose them, until the new ruler of Madagascar, Emil Maurice, revealed to the world the crimes Heydrich had committed during his reign on the island. He called on many of the states created after the fall of the German colonial apparatus to unite to put an end to Von Göring's tyranny and to bring Heydrich to justice, in order to make them pay for the crimes they had committed with impunity against the African people and against their Kaiser. It remains to be seen whether their enterprise will be crowned with success or will be crushed under the boot of the East African tyrants."
east_africa_war.15.a:0 "Justice always triumphs in the end."

east_africa_war.16.t:0 "Operation Anthropoid"
east_africa_war.16.d:0 "As the war with Göring’s fiefdom rages, Maurice and his allies have begun to formulate a plan, codenamed Operation Anthropoid. Though costly, time-consuming, and possibly all for nothing, this plan outlines possible methods to assassinate Reinhard Heydrich, hoping to weaken Göring’s forces by killing his right-hand man. However, trying to pull off such an action in the midst of a war may prove to be impossible, while also denying the people he harmed true justice since he would be unable to stand trial. Maurice had a choice to make - should he simply wait for the war to end so that Heydrich could be put on trial for the whole Kaiserreich to see, or should Operation Anthropoid be engaged, numbering Heydrich’s last days as our hit squad prepares to strike him while he is in hiding?"
east_africa_war.16.a:0 "Launch Operation Anthropoid."
east_africa_war.16.b:0 "Wait until the war’s end so that we may put him on trial."

east_africa_war.17.t:0 "A Quick Exit"
east_africa_war.17.d:0 "With Maurice’s decision to go through with Operation Anthropoid, Heydrich was tracked down and followed to his hideaway. The Beast had been hiding out in a warehouse down by the main docks of a small coastal fishing village, waiting for his chance to jump on the next German ship he could acquiesce so that he could sail away from hellish prison of his own making. With the deathsquad sent by Maurice rapidly closing in on him, Heydrich had become paranoid and delusional. Despite this mental state however, he had an escape plan thoroughly mapped, and now only waited for the smallest peep to run. \n\nPeeking out the nearest window, Heydrich was able to catch a glimpse of a German soldier asking a local dockworker for directions, carefully noting that the soldier was not dressed in the same garb as Göring’s men. Quickly realizing that this was one of Maurice’s men, Heydrich grabbed his go-bag and snuck down into the drainage pipe he had cleared out for such an occasion, and began crawling through the sludge towards its exit at a dumping ground a few miles away. Hearing the soldiers burst into the room above him, Heydrich stayed quiet as a church mouse as he crawled through feces and sewage to get to safety. With his escape going by unnoticed, Maurice’s men have lost the trail, possibly for good, and it would seem that Heydrich has escaped the swift justice coming for him. Now, as long as he stays in hiding and has Göring to protect him, it would seem the Beast is untouchable."
east_africa_war.17.a:0 "Damn that mandman! Find him!!"

east_africa_war.18.t:0 "Slaying the Beast"
east_africa_war.18.d:0 "With Maurice’s decision to go through with Operation Anthropoid, Heydrich was tracked down and followed to his hideaway. The Beast had been hiding out in a warehouse down by the main docks of a small coastal fishing village, waiting for his chance to jump on the next German ship he could acquiesce so that he could sail away from hellish prison of his own making. However, fate had different plans, for the death squad sent by Maurice was rapidly closing in on him. \n\nSitting unaware in his ‘safehouse,’ Heydrich’s world was turned upside down in a flash as soldiers began to swing in through the windows while others barged through the barricaded front door. Before Heydrich could grab his service pistol, whether it be to shoot himself or his attackers, and before he could even let out a final quip, the head the Beast exploded into a fine pink mist as the lead commando pointed his trench gun directly at Heydrich’s head and pulled the trigger. No final words or monologues would be allowed to exit his lips - only the soft gurgling of his last breath bubbling through the fountain of blood that now gushed from where his head once was. With that single trigger-pull, the madness was over, and Heydrich was no more. No fancy trials or begging would save him, nor would Göring come to his aid, for his time had come, as simple as that. \n\nFinishing their task, the hideaway Heydrich had hid out in was ransacked and searched for any evidence while some of the soldiers took Heydrich’s body out back to hack it into pieces. Taking his one in-tact eye, his right hand, and his medals as proof that the job was done, the rest of the dismembered corpse was split between two squads, with the first squad setting the pieces alight and burning them in a small pit of lye while the other squad carried their pieces to the dock’s end, where they tossed the bits into the water as chum for the gathering sharks."
east_africa_war.18.a:0 "And with that, the Beast was no more."

east_africa_war.19.t:0 "Putting Down the Dog"
east_africa_war.19.d:0 "With our victory over Göring and his mad fiefdom, the time has come to dispense justice. In our final assault on Goering’s castle, Reinhard Heydrich was arrested by loyalist forces and brought before both Maurice and the Kaiser in Berlin. What followed was a short but heavily sensationalized show-trial in which Heydrich was found guilty on all charges, ranging from murder, human-rights violations, crimes against humanity, approproation of German funding, and so much more. Once the trial was over, the failed admiral was whisked away to a dark prison complex that lay near the German border with Bohemia, where he was prepped for his final day of life. Allowed for a final meal, Heydrich drank coffee and awaited his final fate, even denying the offered Last Rights from the local chaplain. \n\nWhen the time came, a hood was placed over Heydrich’s head as he was dragged kicking and screaming to the central yard where a firing squad accompanied by the Kaiser and Maurice were waiting for him. As Heydrich faced the wall, the sack was torn off his head, revealing tears that began to drip down his face as he soiled himself, dreading the coming justice. In a flash and with a bang, the Beast dropped to the ground, lifeless, with all that remained of him being a half-headless corpse, a pink mist in the air, and a blood-red stain on the wall in front of him. Without a final word or remark, Heydrich was erased from this world, leaving our planet with one less madman hellbent on burning it all down. Walking up to his corpse, the Kaiser and Maurice both spat on the corpse before the soldiers and guards carried it off to be dumped in a shallow, unmarked grave in the forests that surrounded the prison, ensuring no one would turn this madman’s burial plot into a shrine."
east_africa_war.19.a:0 "With a flash, the Beast is dead."

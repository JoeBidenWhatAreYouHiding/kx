### Events ###
phil.0.t:0 "A Path Towards Independence"
phil.0.d:0 "The Philippines were a Spanish colony until late 1898, when the United States claimed them as a war prize from Spain. Years of violent struggle for independence followed, and as the economic and political crisis in America began to worsen, they finally bore fruit. In 1934, The Tydings-McDuffie Act was passed, creating the Commonwealth of the Philippines with an elected government under Manuel Quezon and a constitution based upon that of the United States, while Washington retained control of the country's foreign affairs and military. More importantly, it stipulated that after ten years of transition, the archipelago would become a fully independent republic. But storm clouds are gathering over America. Will the Philippines achieve independence sooner than expected, and will that lead to them becoming prey for yet another major empire? Only time will tell..."
phil.0.a:0 "Viva la Filipinas!"

phil.1.t:0 "Syndicalist Uprising in Manilla"
phil.1.d:0 "As we have peacefully achieved independence from the United States due to their chaotic Civil War, our young Commonwealth is already facing the dangers of syndicalism. Inspired by both the Combined Syndicates' uprising in America and by the Bharatiya Commune in India, a group of disgruntled army officers have ordered their units to march towards our capital, where they have joined forces with bands of peasants and industrial workers. They are planning to establish a Syndicalist state on our archipelago!"
phil.1.a:0 "Rebels seize the capital and prepare to establish a Syndicalist regime."
phil.1.b:0 "Order our forces to resist the uprising."

phil.2.t:0 "The Army Counter-Coup"
phil.2.d:0 "Despite the Syndicalist-sympathising units seizing most of downtown Manilla, most of the armed forces are still currently siding with the legal government. Will they join the revolutionaries?"
phil.2.a:0 "The army joins the rebels and the government is toppled."
phil.2.b:0 "Loyal units storm the capital and evict the Syndicalists."

phil.4.t:0 "The Revolution is Defeated"
phil.4.d:0 "As the armed forces declared their support for our government, the rebellious units quickly lost support. After one of our generals drove an armoured column towards downtown Manilla, the syndicalists officially surrendered, ending the threat of a Syndicalist coup in our country. With the army occupying key points in the city, however, a new menace looms over the horizon, there are talks that the military may attempt to take the chance to seize power for themselves and establish a dictatorship of their own."
phil.4.a:0 "The army restores the legal government to power."
phil.4.b:0 "A military dictatorship is established."

phil.6.t:0 "Economic Crisis Approaching"
phil.6.d:0 "Following the loss of the American protection due to their civil war, our country has lost a great source of income and our economy is nearing a crisis. Our politicians have come up with several plans, which involve increasing our industrial capacity, moving our economy with an expansion of our armed forces, or developing our mining and forestry sectors. Which shall we choose?"
phil.6.a:0 "Expand our armed forces, this will move our economy."
phil.6.b:0 "We must expand our industrial capacity."
phil.6.c:0 "Explore our natural resources - mining and forestry."

phil.7.t:0 "Economic Development Plan"
phil.7.d.main:0 "As we have decided to undertake a plan to develop our economy and prevent any major crisis, we must now decide who will help us on this project. Shall we look for foreign support, or can the Philippines do this all by themselves?"
phil.7.d.return:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] has refused our request for aid, so we must now reconsider our approach. Who shall we ask to help us with our crisis?"
phil.7.a:0 "Germany is the world's mightiest nation"
phil.7.b:0 "Japan is our natural partner"
phil.7.c:0 "Seek financing from Australasia and the Entente"
phil.7.e:0 "The Commune of France shall help us"
phil.7.f:0 "The Americans are our historical partners"
phil.7.g:0 "We should do this on our own"

phil.8.t:0 "The Philippines Request Support"
phil.8.d:0 "Representatives from the recently-independent Philippines have approached us, as their president has come up with a plan to prevent an economic crisis in their country: they plan to expand their armed forces, thus increasing their industrial output and creating jobs for their people. They wish [Root.GetNameDef] to help finance them on this task, which could prove useful - not only would we prevent them from destabilising, but we would gain a friend in the region."
phil.8.a:0 "We will help them"
phil.8.b:0 "We'd gain little from this"

phil.9.t:0 "The Philippines Request Support"
phil.9.d:0 "Representatives from the recently-independent Philippines have approached us. They are looking for [Root.GetAdjective] help with expanding their industrial output, aiming on becoming a major economic power in Southeast Asia. Should we finance their projects? Not only would we prevent them from destabilising, but we would gain a friend in the region."
phil.9.a:0 "Finance the expansion of their industry"
phil.9.b:0 "We'd gain little from this"

phil.10.t:0 "The Philippines Request Support"
phil.10.d:0 "Representatives from the recently-independent Philippines have approached our government with a request. They are looking for [Root.GetAdjective] help with expanding their mining and forestry industries, aiming on becoming a major provider of natural resources on Southeast Asia. Should we finance their projects? Not only would we prevent them from destabilising, but we would gain a friend in the region."
phil.10.a:0 "We will help them"
phil.10.b:0 "We'd gain little from this"

phil.11.t:0 "New Divisions Raised"
phil.11.d:0 "After nearly one year, new infantry units are ready to be deployed. These divisions were developed in our own country, with help from industrial specialists from [From.GetNameDef]. Thanks to this aid programme, we were able to open new industrial parks, which will benefit our economy as a whole."
phil.11.a:0 "This is good!"

phil.12.t:0 "New Factories Built"
phil.12.d:0 "After nearly one year, a new industrial complex has been inaugurated in Manila. These factories were built with financing and the help of industrial experts from [From.GetNameDef]. This will benefit our economy as a whole!"
phil.12.a:0 "This is good!"

phil.13.t:0 "Economy Improves"
phil.13.d:0 "After nearly one year, thanks to the critical help of [From.GetNameDef], our government has opened a new set of mines and lumber exploration areas. This will benefit our economy as a whole, as we aim on becoming a major provider of natural resources in Southeast Asia!"
phil.13.a:0 "This is good!"

phil.14.t:0 "Naval Base in the Philippines?"
phil.14.d:0 "Following our first economic aid package to the Philippines, we have created a large network of contacts there. [Root.GetAdjective] businesses are thriving on this new market, but we could also use these new friends to advance our strategic interests. Some circles within the [Root.GetAdjective] Navy believe we should convince their government to allow the establishment of a major naval base in the north of the archipelago, to bring them further into our sphere."
phil.14.a:0 "Propose a deal to their government"
phil.14.b:0 "Don't we have enough bases in Asia already?"

phil.15.t:0 "A Proposal from [From.GetNameDef]"
phil.15.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] Navy has contacted our government with a proposal to establish a naval base on the north of our main island, Luzon. Some politicians fear the growing [From.GetAdjective] influence in our country, but a good part of our cabinet believe we could use their help on a new round of economic expansion plans."
phil.15.a:0 "Refuse! Our country is not for sale!"
phil.15.b:0 "We want their financing for a new industrial complex, then"

phil.16.t:0 "Filipinos Demand Financing"
phil.16.d:0 "The government of the Philippines has accepted our proposal for the establishment of a [Root.GetAdjective] naval base in their territory, on the condition we help them with the financing of a new industrial complex."
phil.16.a:0 "This isn't even worth the trouble"
phil.16.b:0 "It's a deal!"

phil.17.t:0 "[From.GetAdjective] Naval Base Inaugurated"
phil.17.d:0 "The new base of the [From.GetAdjective] Navy has been inaugurated today in the province of Cagayan. As previously agreed, [From.GetNameDef] has helped us with the construction of new industries, which have also started work today."
phil.17.a:0 "Great!"

phil.18.t:0 "New Naval Base in the Philippines"
phil.18.d:0 "As previously agreed with [From.GetNameDef], the new base of the [Root.GetAdjective] Navy on the island of Luzon has been inaugurated today. This new facility will help us in conducting new operations in the Pacific."
phil.18.a:0 "Great!"

phil.19.t:0 "Alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.19.d:0 "Due to our growing influence on the Philippines, some within our cabinet believe that we should invite their government to the [Root.GetFactionName], as well."
phil.19.a:0 "Not interested"
phil.19.b:0 "Make the proposal"

phil.20.t:0 "Join the [From.GetFactionName]?"
phil.20.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has invited us to join the [From.GetFactionName]. Should we accept their invitation? Even though we will certainly profit through many trade deals with [From.GetNameDef] and her sphere of influence, we may be dragged into unwanted conflicts."
phil.20.a:0 "This is too dangerous"
phil.20.b:0 "Accept their proposal"

phil.21.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Has Refused"
phil.21.d:0 "Sadly, it appears the [From.GetAdjective] government refuses to see reason. They have turned down our proposal."
phil.21.a:0 "Ah well"

phil.22.t:0 "The Sabah Dispute"
phil.22.d:0 "Due to several complex colonial treaties involving Spain and Great Britain in the XIXth century, the Philippines has a legal claim to the territory of Sabah, now incorporated as the northern part of the German colony of Borneo. We know that, due to the 1936 Economic Crisis, Germany was willing to cede control of some of its colonies due to their great costs. Perhaps we could use the opportunity and ask our allies for the territory to be returned to us?"
phil.22.a:0 "Make a proposal to Germany."
phil.22.b:0 "This would cost too much, just present our claims."
phil.22.c:0 "We're not interested in Sabah, let the Germans keep it."

phil.23.t:0 "Philippine Claims On Sabah"
phil.23.d:0 "Due to several complex colonial treaties involving Spain and Great Britain in the XIXth century, the Philippines has a legal claim to the territory of Sabah, now incorporated as the northern part of the German colony of Borneo. We have been approached by Filipino representatives, who are inquiring whether we'd be interested to transfer sovereignty of the territory to them."
phil.23.a:0 "Cede Sabah to our allies as a gesture of goodwill."
phil.23.b:0 "We will cede the territory if they're willing to pay for it."
phil.23.c:0 "North Borneo is an important part of our colonial empire, we must keep it."

phil.24.t:0 "A Proposal From Germany"
phil.24.d:0 "The German Empire has declared that they are willing to cede us the territory of Sabah, if we pay them for it!"
phil.24.a:0 "Accept their demands."
phil.24.b:0 "This is more than we can afford, sorry."

phil.25.t:0 "The Transfer of Sabah"
phil.25.d:0 "The Philippines has accepted our conditions for the deal."
phil.25.a:0 "Okay."

phil.40.t:0 "The Sabah Dispute"
phil.40.d:0 "Due to several complex colonial treaties involving Spain and Great Britain in the XIXth century, the Philippines has a legal claim to the territory of Sabah, now incorporated as the northern part of Borneo. Since we are currently protected by a foreign power, this would be a nice moment to formally present our claims."
phil.40.a:0 "Sabah is rightfully ours"
phil.40.b:0 "We're not interested in Sabah"

phil.41.t:0 "Filipino Claims to Sabah"
phil.41.d:0 "Due to several complex colonial treaties involving Spain and Great Britain in the XIXth century, the Philippines has a legal claim to the territory of Sabah, now incorporated as the northern part of the [Root.GetAdjective] colony of Borneo. Today, their government has reinforced their claims to the region."
phil.41.a:0 "Good luck with that"

phil.42.t:0 "Claiming Sabah"
phil.42.d:0 "Due to several complex colonial treaties involving Spain and Great Britain in the XIXth century, the Philippines has a legal claim to the territory of Sabah, currently occupied by the Japanese Empire. This would be a nice moment to claim the land for us."
phil.42.a:0 "Sabah is rightfully ours, present our claims."
phil.42.b:0 "We're not interested in Sabah, let Japan keep it."

phil.43.t:0 "The Philippines Claim Sabah"
phil.43.d:0 "Due to several complex colonial treaties involving Spain and Great Britain in the XIXth century, the Philippines has a legal claim to the territory of Sabah, currently occupied by us. They have taken the opportunity to reinforce the claims."
phil.43.a:0 "Of course, transfer Sabah to them"
phil.43.b:0 "Sabah is a part of the Empire"

phil.44.t:0 "Seizing the Moment"
phil.44.d:0 "Due to several complex colonial treaties involving Spain and Great Britain in the XIXth century, the Philippines has a legal claim to the territory of Sabah, currently occupied by the German Empire. With the Reich involved in a large war which they appear to be losing, this could be the time for our troops to capture the disputed territory - surely Germany will struggle to oppose us!"
phil.44.a:0 "Send in the troops, occupy Sabah"
phil.44.b:0 "This is too dangerous nonetheless"

phil.45.t:0 "The Philippines Annex North Borneo"
phil.45.d:0 "Taking advantage of our setbacks, the Philippines has sent troops to occupy Sabah in our colony of North Borneo!"
phil.45.a:0 "We cannot oppose them, evacuate our personnel!"
phil.45.b:0 "This will not go unpunished! War!"

phil.52.t:0 "Naval base in the Philippines?"
phil.52.d:0 "Following the Australasian economic aid package to the Philippines, the Entente has built a large network of contacts there. Some circles within the [Root.GetAdjective] Navy believe we should convince their government to allow the establishment of a major naval base in the north of the archipelago, to bring them further into our sphere."

phil.69.t:0 "Syndicalism in East Asia"
phil.69.d.bhc:0 "After our aid programme to the Philippines, some members of our cabinet have thought about considering that nation as our springboard for the spread of Syndicalism in East Asia. Therefore, we should invite them to join our military alliance, the Internationale. Some ministers see East Asia as too much a distant objective for us, but instead propose that we pass the responsibility on to the Bharatiya Commune."
phil.69.d.nobhc:0 "After our aid programme to the Philippines, some members of our cabinet have thought about considering that nation as our springboard for the spread of Syndicalism in East Asia. Therefore, we should invite them to join our military alliance, the Internationale."
phil.69.a:0 "Invite them to join the Internationale"
phil.69.b:0 "Promote an alliance with the Bharatiya Commune"
phil.69.c:0 "Syndicalism in Asia is only a distant goal"

phil.70.t:0 "Alliance with the Philippines?"
phil.70.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap], leader of the Syndicalist Revolution, has been undertaking economic aid programmes with a new socialist republic in Asia, the Philippines. If that young republic ever falls into a war against the bourgeoisie powers, however, they are too far away to do much help. Therefore, they have asked us to enter talks with the Philippines and attempt to establish an alliance of syndicalist nations in Asia."
phil.70.a:0 "Not interested, sorry."
phil.70.b:0 "Make the proposal."

phil.71.t:0 "Eastern Socialist Union and the Philippines?"
phil.71.d:0 "[From.From.GetNameDefCap], leader of the Syndicalist Revolution, has been observing with great interest the socialist reforms we've been undertaking on the Philippines. Even if we are a bastion of socialism in Asia, they are too far away and wouldn't be able to do much in case we get involved in a war. Therefore, they have convinced [From.GetNameDef] to enter talks with us in an attempt to establish an alliance of syndicalist nations in Asia."
phil.71.a:0 "This is too dangerous"
phil.71.b:0 "Accept their proposal"

phil.72.t:0 "The Philippines Has Accepted"
phil.72.d:0 "The Philippines has accepted our offer of an alliance!"
phil.72.a:0 "Great!"

phil.80.t:0 "Re-establishing Old Ties"
phil.80.d:0 "After our aid programme to the Philippines, some members of our cabinet have considered reestablishing our protection over that country. Even if reestablishing the old U.S-controlled Commonwealth would be nearly impossible, we should at least try."
phil.80.a:0 "Contact them"
phil.80.b:0 "We no longer have interests in East Asia"

phil.82.t:0 "The Philippines Has Accepted"
phil.82.d:0 "While there was some controversy caused by what they saw as 'a return of American Imperialism', the Filipino government has seen the wisdom in accepting our proposal of protection and restored relations."
phil.82.a:0 "Great!"

phil.83.t:0 "An American Proposal"
phil.83.d:0 "Even if our two countries no longer have any political ties as they had before the American Civil War, the United States has been observing with great interest the reforms we've been undertaking on the Philippines. In order to re-establish ties between our two countries, the Americans have offered a treaty to put the bad blood behind us and improve relations and business ties between our countries."
phil.83.a:0 "This is a return to colonialism, we're not interested."
phil.83.b:0 "Accept their proposal."

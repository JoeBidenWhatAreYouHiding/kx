AST_KR_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Australasia's union, despite being initially established under the brief martial law of Birdwood in 1924, has seen peaceful unity in recent years. The autonomy granted to New Zealand has allowed both members to bloom independently while maintaining a strong confederation. Although the economy suffered malaise due to the depression following the collapse of the British Empire, it has turned a corner with the Scullin Labor government and its Lyons Plan. Despite these promising developments, political chaos has ensued. Both major parties in Australian politics are fracturing, with the Scullin government splitting into three factions. Meanwhile, the Country Party has taken the caretaker Prime Minister position from its senior coalition partner, leaving New Zealand as the more stable member of the confederation. Amidst this political turmoil, the nation's future remains in the balance whether it will continue its upward trend or find a new future away from the political system of the past."

POLITICS_HENRY_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Henry of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though regarded as an extremely nervous child, Henry grew into an active and modest man. While Australasians appreciate Henry's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Henry is well liked. With the country still mourning from such a tragic air-crash, Henry toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_ALBERT_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "Prince Albert of Windsor, elder brother of the deceased Prince George, has been appointed Governor-General of Australasia. Though ridiculed as a child for his noticeable stammer, Albert grew into a collected and dutiful man. While Australasians appreciate Albert's virtue, the expectation among many in its government was that appointment to the post of Governor-General would be restored to the discretion of the Australasian parliament. Regardless of the disappointment of some, however, Albert is well liked. With the country still mourning from such tragic air-crash, Albert toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed."
POLITICS_EDWARD_WINDSOR_DESC_AST: "The eldest son of the late King George V, Prince Edward hoped to be the standard bearer for the reclamation of his beloved Britain; a fate that would never come to be, as circumstances caused his fall from grace and eventual abdication from the throne of the land he loved so much. Forced to accept the conciliatory prize of Governor-General of Australia due to the tragic death of his brother, Edward toils diligently to ensure that Australasia is properly governed, despite the fact that Edward was seemingly only granted the post to get him out of the way of Canadian affairs... and because everyone else was either busy somewhere else, or dead."

### Focuses ###
AST_first_labor_victory:0 "The Labor Party's Resurgence"
AST_first_labor_victory_desc:0 "Against the odds and after the tumultuous downfall of Scullin, the Labor Party has clawed its way back to power. Despite internal schisms with Langists and socialists pulling in different directions, the party has united under a common banner of restoring dignity and prosperity to the working class."
AST_first_lang_labor_victory:0 "Lang Labor's Triumph"
AST_first_lang_labor_victory_desc:0 "In the wake of Labor's fracturing, Lang's decisive victory over his rivals has positioned him as the true champion of the working people. Bold policies and unwavering defiance of conservative orthodoxy have resonated with those who feel betrayed by the establishment."
AST_stay_with_the_lyons_plan:0 "Repackage the Lyons Plan"
AST_stay_with_the_lyons_plan_desc:0 "During the darkest days of the Depression, the Lyons Plan emerged as a pragmatic solution to placate the upper and middle class while rebuilding the economy. While expanding labour rights and protections it would also cut government spending with waves of austerity, austerity that eventually fractured the Labor Party. Now, under Forde's vision, we may balance the scales - reducing the cuts and expanding welfare so that the working class is not left behind as Lyons did."
AST_modernize_the_theodore_plan:0 "Revitalise the Theodore Plan"
AST_modernize_the_theodore_plan_desc:0 "The Theodore Plan, born out of Queensland's premier 'Red' Ted Theodore, offers a working class alternative to Lyons' conservatism. Embracing Keynesian ideals, it aimed to reject the status quo and elevate the working class through bold interventionist policies. The plan would feature an expansion of credit to farmers and small businesses through the issue of 'fiduciary notes' which could be redeemed after we fix the stagnant economy."
AST_implement_the_lang_plan:0 "Implement the Lang Plan"
AST_implement_the_lang_plan_desc:0 "Lang's defiance of austerity and rejection of England's unjust war debts are more than just political statements - they were a declaration of economic independence. His plan is centred on stimulating industrial growth, creating jobs, and ensuring fair wages for workers, all while investing heavily in public infrastructure and social welfare."
AST_end_the_repayment_of_war_debts:0 "Break the Chains of War Debt"
AST_end_the_repayment_of_war_debts_desc:0 "The war debts imposed by England, only owed because we fought and died for England, have long shackled our economy from resources we could use to fix the stagnation. With 275 million pounds owed at exorbitant interest rates, the time has come to cast off these financial chains. By refusing to pay the remaining debt, we assert our sovereignty and prioritise the welfare of our people over colonial obligations."
AST_extend_the_unions_in_the_workplace:0 "Restore Workplace Unionism"
AST_extend_the_unions_in_the_workplace_desc:0 "The Bruce government's assault on workplace representation left workers vulnerable to cruel bosses and unsafe conditions. Scullin's attempts to rebuild were tragically cut short in his second term, leaving the task unfinished. Now, we must take up the mantle and strengthen industrial relations laws, ensuring that unions have the power they need to protect workers' rights and maintain workplace stability."
AST_working_class_protectionism:0 "Protectionism for the Working Class"
AST_working_class_protectionism_desc:0 "Protectionism is more than just an economic policy; it's a shield for [AST.GetAdjective] workers against the flood of cheap foreign labor that threatens their livelihoods. By imposing tariffs and redirecting them to bolster secondary industries, we not only protect wages but also ensure that our economy grows in a way that benefits the working class."
AST_devolve_rights_to_the_states:0 "Restore State Sovereignty"
AST_devolve_rights_to_the_states_desc:0 "In response to Lang's policies the Federal government centralised power and eroded the autonomy that once defined [AST.GetNameDef]'s states. Recognizing the need to correct this imbalance, we are committed to devolving rights back to the states, allowing them to regain control over taxation and local governance."
AST_commonwealth_employees_furlough_act:0 "The Commonwealth Employees Furlough Act"
AST_commonwealth_employees_furlough_act_desc:0 "The Commonwealth Employees Furlough Act represents a significant step forward in securing the rights of public servants, offering them the time off they deserve while laying the groundwork for long-service leave in the private sector. This initiative not only enhances job security but also promotes a more balanced and productive workforce."
AST_bring_splitters_back_into_the_fold:0 "Reunite the Labor Factions"
AST_bring_splitters_back_into_the_fold_desc:0 "The Labor Party's descent into factionalism has left it fractured and ineffective, unable to present a cohesive vision for the nation. The time has come to heal these wounds, bringing the splintered factions back into the fold. The Langites and other Laborites who left us are welcome back with open arms as we build a proper united government"
AST_expand_maternity_and_pensions_for_widows:0 "Enhance Support for Widows and Maternity"
AST_expand_maternity_and_pensions_for_widows_desc:0 "As part of our broader commitment to social welfare, we will expand maternity benefits and pensions for widows, providing much-needed support to those who have lost their spouses. This initiative is more than just financial assistance; it's a recognition of the sacrifices made by these women and a commitment to ensuring they can live with dignity."
AST_use_labor_dailys_support:0 "Leverage Labor Daily's Influence"
AST_use_labor_dailys_support_desc:0 "Labor Daily, long dominated by Lang's faction, is a powerful tool for shaping public opinion and rallying support in South Australia and New South Wales. By expanding and harnessing its influence, we can align centrist Laborites with Lang's progressive policies, creating a unified front within the party."
AST_drag_the_actu_back:0 "Reclaim ACTU Allegiance"
AST_drag_the_actu_back_desc:0 "The ACTU, under the sway of Jock Garden's radicalism, has drifted from the core principles of Labor. To reclaim their support, we must moderate the ACTU's influence while expanding its role within our party. By offering concessions to leaders like Albert Monk and Percy Clarey, we can bring them back into our fold, strengthening our position and ensuring the ACTU aligns with our vision for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]'s future."
AST_expand_the_commonwealth_office_of_education:0 "Elevate National Education"
AST_expand_the_commonwealth_office_of_education_desc:0 "The Commonwealth Office of Education is the cornerstone of our nation's educational infrastructure, but it must evolve to meet the demands of a modern [AST.GetName]. By expanding its reach and resources, we can ensure that every child has access to quality education, regardless of their background."
AST_face_down_the_white_army:0 "Confront the White Army Threat"
AST_face_down_the_white_army_desc:0 "The rise of paramilitary groups like the New Guard and the League of National Defence represents a dire threat to moderate Labor and union organising. These factions, often violent and extremist, aim to undermine our democratic institutions and impose their will through force. To secure our future, we must confront and dismantle these organisations, ensuring that [AST.GetNameDef] remains a nation governed by law and justice, not by the barrel of a gun."
AST_drag_jock_back_into_the_lang_gang:0 "Integrate Jock Into the Lang Gang"
AST_drag_jock_back_into_the_lang_gang_desc:0 "Jock Garden's failed bid for the Prime Ministership has left him isolated, yet his influence among the socialist faction remains strong. By reaching out and bringing him into Lang's camp, we can reunite the left-wing forces within the party, with Jock's previous relationship with Lang in the trades hall being key to his compliance."
AST_implement_the_goods_standard:0 "Implement the 'Goods Standard'"
AST_implement_the_goods_standard_desc:0 "The time has come to break free from the constraints of the gold standard that have long shackled our economy. By implementing the 'Goods Standard', we will redefine our economic measures based on the nation's whole value of goods and services produced, not its arbitrary gold reserves."
AST_australia's_oldest_party_stabilizes:0 "Labor's Soul Reforged"
AST_australia's_oldest_party_stabilizes_desc:0 "After years of internal strife and factionalism, the Labor Party has emerged from the crucible of conflict stronger and more unified than ever. The re-aligning of the Langites and socialist factions has solidified a foundation built on social justice, worker solidarity, and a clear vision for [AST.GetNameDef]'s future. As the dust settles, the party stands ready to lead the nation with renewed purpose and unwavering resolve."
AST_lang_is_right:0 "Lang is Right!"
AST_lang_is_right_desc:0 "The victory of Jack Lang over Federal Labor marks a decisive moment in [AST.GetAdjective] politics. Lang's unwavering commitment to rejecting austerity and defending the working class has resonated with the people, proving that his vision for a fairer, more independent [AST.GetName] is not just possible but essential."

AST_second_labor_victory:0 "Labor Will Finish the Job"
AST_second_labor_victory_desc:0 "Riding the waves of economic recovery and party unity, the Labor Party secures a second term in office, reaffirming its place as the steadfast guardian of the working class. In a world teetering on the edge of chaos, Labor's leadership provides a beacon of stability and hope, much like it did during the trials of the Great War. This victory is not just a mandate to govern, but a testament to the enduring legacy of the Labor movement."
AST_second_lang_labor_victory:0 "The Big Fella's Unyielding Resolve"
AST_second_lang_labor_victory_desc:0 "Jack Lang's re-election cements his vision of a democratic and independent [AST.GetName], where the welfare of its citizens takes precedence over foreign debts and capitalist interests. Lang's unyielding resolve has reshaped the political landscape, setting the course for a nation unafraid to chart its own destiny."
AST_establish_university_commission:0 "The University Commission's Minds of Tomorrow"
AST_establish_university_commission_desc:0 "Building upon the educational reforms of previous terms, the establishment of a University Commission marks a significant investment in [AST.GetNameDef]'s future. By focusing on higher education, we aim to cultivate the minds that will drive national growth and innovation in the coming decades."
AST_conscription_limited_to_defense:0 "Conscription Limited to Defence"
AST_conscription_limited_to_defense_desc:0 "Despite Labor's historical stance against conscription, the growing regional threats have forced us to reconsider our position. By limiting conscription strictly to defence, we strike a delicate balance between upholding our principles and ensuring [AST.GetNameDef]'s security."
AST_restrict_the_right_to_expel_tenets:0 "Embed the Party Machine"
AST_restrict_the_right_to_expel_tenets_desc:0 "Under Jack Lang's leadership, the Labor Party has become dominated by the NSW faction, with its epicentre in the Sydney Trades Hall.

Local militias dominate city streets, while guerrillas lurk in the bush. Meanwhile, the ANZAC army under Blamey grows increasingly uncomfortable with the unchecked power of these paramilitary forces. In response, the League will push a disarmament bill through the newly formed national parliament, aiming to strip these militias of their arms.

austral.1.t:0 "The Status of the Confederation"
austral.1.d:0 "Formed in 1925 as a result of the Consolidation of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation combined the British Australasian Dominions of Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg brought great change and hardship as the war strained both society and the economy, which manifested in the short-lived Melbourne Commune led by the Victorian Socialist Party. Although brutally put down by the Hughes government, denounced by the Labor opposition, and suppressed by demobilised Australian Imperial Force veterans, it was a sign of the hard times ahead.\n\nWhen the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to its core, it left Australia and New Zealand without their main trading partner while Germany encroached further, taking New Caledonia and threatening the Tasman Sea between the dominions. As a result emergency protocols were implemented, suspending elections and appointing William Birdwood as Governor-General. For three years, Birdwood ruled as an empowered national protector alongside his ally, Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party, under a combined Australasia as it stabilised and prepared for democracy.\n\nNew Zealand was reorganised into an Autonomy with its own parliament and legislative council inside Australasia, free to pass legislation locally and be free of federal interference but also unable to be represented federally. Its Prime Minister stands with the federal head of government, deciding on foreign policy and representing the nation on the world stage."
austral.1.a:0 "In 1928 elections were held..."

austral.2.t:0 "The Status of Federal Politics"
austral.2.d:0 "In the first elections since Birdwood temporarily suspended them, the National Party won again due to the red scare of a socialist victory so soon after the fall of England. In a twist of fortune, Hughes was ousted as the newly formed Country Party won enough seats to force the Nationalists into a coalition, the main term being the removal of Hughes. Stanley Bruce served for one term, but his efforts to dismantle the nation's system of arbitration, his failure to improve the stagnated economy, and decades of National Party rule ended his tenure.\n\nJames Scullin, now leader of the Labor Party, ran on negotiation and conciliation between the classes and presented himself as a moderate, far from the image of the syndicalist menace. The appointment of Joseph 'Honest Joe' Lyons, former Premier of Tasmania, as his Treasurer rather than the former Queensland Premier Ted Theodore, further cemented this image. While the labour movement formed a united front to elect Scullin, the honeymoon ended with the implementation of the Lyons Plan, a solution to drag Australia out of economic stagnation. A mix of financial orthodoxy, industrial relations reforms, and austerity, the plan split the party. Over three years, internal conflicts arose as both the Theodore and Lang plans promised a Keynesian approach to stimulating the economy. Although the economy improved, many in the working class saw little benefit. The announcement of further austerity cuts by the Treasurer ultimately ripped the Scullin government apart, with Jack Beasley and Jock Garden representing the Federal Lang Labor Party and the Socialist Labor Party respectively, voting in no confidence."
austral.2.a:0 "With the Nationalists buckling, Earle Page took the role as the Prime Minister."

austral.3.t:0 "The Passing of King George V"
austral.3.d:0 "News has reached from the Canadian Ambassador of the death of King George V this morning in his sleep. Grief and sadness has gripped our nation with the news of the death of the last monarch to rule the Isles. Though Australasia has not suffered as much as the English did during the revolution, we must share in their sorrows and make sure the memory of this exile be just a footnote in history forgotten by all who lived through it."
austral.3.a:0 "The King died yearning for something just beyond the waves."

austral.4.t:0 "The Caretaker Prime Minister"
austral.4.d:0 "In a twist of fate, Earle Page has ascended to the position of Prime Minister of Australasia. With the fall of the Scullin government, the once-mighty Labor Party splintered into three factions yet despite these divisions, Labor remains the largest party, leaving the Nationalists unable to govern effectively without broader support.\n\nEarle Page, previously the Deputy Prime Minister, has seized this rare opportunity to steer the government. However, the road ahead is fraught with challenges. The Page Ministry's lack of popularity is palpable. Urban voters, feeling neglected and resentful of the rural favouritism, are increasingly disillusioned. This discontent may set the stage for a resurgence of the Labor remnants, despite their recent fragmentation."
austral.4.a:0 "Countrymindedness rules"

austral.5.t:0 "The Split in the ALP's Corpse"
austral.5.d:0 "The once-unified Labor Party has splintered into three distinct factions. Jock Garden leads the Socialist Labor Party, promising to achieve the socialist objective through democratic means. The Langists, composed of disillusioned moderates, trade unionists who oppose socialism but demand radical reforms and those loyal to Lang's vision, have also broken away. This fragmentation ripped apart Labor's supply and confidence and brought down the Scullin government.\n\nDespite these divisions, the combined Labor factions still hold a majority in Parliament, effectively blocking any coalition legislation and deadlocking the government. The remaining Labor members are divided into two camps: one led by Frank Forde, who aims to revive and modify the Lyons Plan to better support the working class, and the other led by John Curtin, who advocates for the ambitious Keynesian Theodore Plan to stimulate the economy from the bottom up."
austral.5.a:0 "Unite or die."

austral.6.t:0 "The Nationalists Buckle"
austral.6.d:0 "After a crucial vote brought down the Scullin government, the Nationalist Party, led by John Latham, took control. However, Latham's inability to pass legislation against the dominant Labor factions led to his downfall before a new election could be called to push out the Labor remnants. Internal party strife saw Latham ousted by Hughes, who held a grudge from his ousting, and Menzies, who sought leadership. Progressive liberals led by Charles Merret within the party also turned against Latham due to disagreements over economic and social policies, becoming independent members in parliament. In this turmoil, Deputy Prime Minister Earle Page became the caretaker Prime Minister, refusing to call an election to hold the position of PM. The Country Party now sees a prime opportunity to force the Nationalists into concessions for ministerial positions and policy changes."
austral.6.a:0 "Both major parties at an impasse."

austral.9.t:0 "A Secret Accord Between the AFAL and the White Army"
austral.9.d:0 "As socialist sentiments rise within Australasia, conservative forces have mobilised to oppose any potential SLP victory. The White Army, composed of the New Guard, the Old Guard, and the League of National Security, has formed alliances to counter the socialist threat. The All for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] League, an alternative conservative movement rising in opposition to the Nationalists, with significant overlap in membership has agreed to support the White Army, promising protection from the law in exchange for political backing.\n\nWith many members of the defence forces affiliated with these organisations, it is clear that an SLP victory will not be met peacefully. They are prepared to defend their vision of Australasia, potentially leading to a violent clash should the socialists come to power."
austral.9.a:0 "We stand ready."

austral.10.t:0 "1936 [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] Labor Party Leadership Election"
austral.10.d:0 "Labor is deeply divided between two factions. Frank Forde represents the moderate to centre Laborites who advocate for the reimplementation of a new worker-centric Lyons plan. In contrast, John Curtin leads the centre to left Laborites, who push for a Keynesian approach to economic growth. With a party election to determine which faction will lead the results is that..."
austral.10.a:0 "John Curtin wins!"
austral.10.b:0 "Frank Forde wins!"

austral.11.t:0 "Leadership Spill in New Zealand"
austral.11.d:0 "When the Act of Consolidation was passed, New Zealand, amidst a complete economic collapse and the encroachment of Germany, was initially unwilling to join Australia if it would be reduced to a mere state. Consequently, it was agreed that New Zealand's Parliament and Legislative Council would operate independently of Australia. While New Zealand could not vote federally it retained legislative autonomy within its borders and its Prime Minister stood alongside the Australasian Prime Minister on matters of foreign affairs and national representation.\n\nWilliam Massey led the nation during its transition, with Joseph Ward replacing him to lead the United Party in the first elections. Ward faced strong resistance from both the Reform and Labour parties, leading to the United Party losing votes from both the left and the right. In 1931, William Nosworthy won the election for the Reform Party and served two terms. However, the increasing failure of the economy, due to neglect of funds by the federal government, left his ministry increasingly unpopular.\n\nNow William Noosworthy has been ousted from the position by his own party, the Reform Party, due to his lacklustre leadership and engagement. Now replaced with Gordon Coates who has been seen as a strong candidate having been a strong campaigner and charismatic in his previous roles. Despite the leadership change, the state of the New Zealand economy remains dire and the Reform Party's popularity continues to wane. With the Labour party agitating the New Zealand political landscape is turbulent as the nation seeks a way out of economic malaise."
austral.11.a:0 "Coates has his work cut out for him."

austral.12.t:0 "Earle Page Sets Out His Terms"
austral.12.d:0 "In recent speeches, Earle Page has publicly stated his disdain for Hughes and Menzies, stating that he will refuse to serve under them and will need significant concessions to reform the coalition. Upon this speech hitting the newspapers, anger shook the Nationalists as it had the unintended effect of bolstering support for both Hughes and Menzies, shaking up this race for nominee."
austral.12.a:0 "It's anyone's game"

austral.13.t:0 "1936 Nationalist Party Leadership Election"
austral.13.d:0 "The Nationalists are set to decide their new leader amidst chaos and the looming presence of the Country Party. Stanley Bruce and John Latham, who share similar support bases, have formed a tentative alliance with one expected to step down in favour of the more popular candidate. Meanwhile, Hughes and Menzies continue to push their separate agendas. In the end the elected member is..."
austral.13.a:0 "Billy Hughes!"
austral.13.b:0 "Stanley Bruce!"
austral.13.c:0 "John Latham!"
austral.13.e:0 "Robert Menzies!"

austral.14.t:0 "Page Gives Way to the Nats"
austral.14.d:0 "Earle Page, with an established relationship with Latham and Bruce, has agreed to rejoin the coalition after securing concessions paving the way for a unified front in the next election. However his animosity towards Hughes and Menzies remains strong, preventing full collaboration."
austral.14.a:0 "Finally some stability."

austral.15.t:0 "Page Refuses to Kiss the Ring"
austral.15.d:0 "Earle Page has openly refused to join a coalition with Hughes and Menzies, causing friction within the Nationalist Party. Initially supported by his party, Page's intransigence is now seen as a threat to their electoral prospects. As the coalition struggles to hold together, Page's actions may be leading to his unravelling."
austral.15.a:0 "A dangerous gambit."

austral.16.t:0 "The Governor General Passes a Writ for an Early Election"
austral.16.d:0 "With the Nationalist leadership in chaos, lacking confidence in the House, and the three divided Labor factions too fragmented to govern effectively the governor general has called an election. The Governor-General will dissolve both the senate and parliament and have new elections to break the deadlock. Further with this New Zealand will have new elections to coincide with the new federal mandate."
austral.16.a:0 "Perhaps this will end this chaos?"

austral.18.t:0 "An Approach to the Labor Reconciliation"
austral.18.d:0 "As Labor attempts to reunite its three factions, a Special Federal Conference has occurred in an attempt to reconcile the Labor Party. The electoral chances of the Labor Party are understood by all factions, if Labor does not unite it will not win the next election. Despite this it seems this unity conference has instead become a poaching session with each party attempting to sway members to support their faction. With the outcome of this conference whatever party is able to manoeuvre the more candidates may be in the prime position to be the legitimate Labor Party."
austral.18.a:0 "The ALP stands as the main faction."
austral.18.b:0 "Lang Labor is able to sway many delegates its way."
austral.18.c:0 "The SLP gains more legitimacy from the conference."

austral.19.t:0 "The All for Australasia League Seizes on the [AST.GetAdjective] Industries Protection League"
austral.19.d:0 "The prime battle between the All for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] League and the Nationalists has not been in speeches nor in electoral districts. Instead it has been waged in the home of industrialists, the meetings of bankers and the councils of business men that are integral to the nation's growth. The AFAL has found its stage against the Nationalist establishment in attempting to sway the rich and powerful of the nation to its cause. The most important is the [AST.GetAdjective] Industries Protection League made up of the most important businessmen in [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] and has been split between supporters of the Nationalists and the AFAL for some time. With the flipping of key individuals on the council the official party that the league supports and funds has changed, leaving the Nationalists without a paddle. With the AFAL having a strong power base in the middle class, this change may sway many in the upper echelons of business, splitting the vote for the Nationalists further."
austral.19.a:0 "A massive development."

austral.21.t:0 "A Battle for the Trades Hall"
austral.21.d:0 "Centers of union activity, particularly the Trades Halls, are now battlegrounds for the three Labor factions. Jock Garden's influence over the unions is formidable, with many unions aligned with his trade hall reds. In response, the federal government is leveraging the conservative Australasian Workers' Union AWU to counteract Garden's dominance. The main front is found in the New South Wales trade hall, the centre of both Lang and Jocks power as both attempt to sway the hall's resources in their direction. The result of a fierce struggle for control over the nation's unions is..."
austral.21.a:0 "The ALP takes control"
austral.21.b:0 "Unions defect support to Lang!"
austral.21.c:0 "Jock ingrains himself more in the union structure."

austral.24.t:0 "Federal Labor Intervenes Against the Reds"
austral.24.d:0 "With the [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] Council of Trade Unions leaning towards the Socialist Labor Party rather than mainstream Labor after its adoption of the socialist objective, the ALP is launching a campaign to bring union voters back. Led by Percy Clarey and supported by moderate unions such as the Federated Clerks Union and the Amalgamated Food Preservers' Union, this effort aims to rebuild Labor unity. The loyalty of the anti-socialist AWU, led by Tom Dougherty, is also playing a crucial role in this strategy. The current leader of the ACTU Albert Monk, while defecting to the SLP, is a moderate and may be swayed back to the ALP."
austral.24.a:0 "ACTU moderates back the ALP."
austral.24.b:0 "The moderates stay with the SLP."

austral.26.t:0 "The Coalition Makes Its Choice"
austral.26.d:0 "Facing threats from both the left, with the split Labor Party, and the right, with the All for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] League, the Nationalist-Country coalition is in a precarious position. Internal divisions within the Nationalists and the opportunistic moves by the Country Party are faustral. Further destabilising the coalition, making their political future uncertain. Will the Country Party and the Nationals reform the coalition and if so who should have primacy?"
austral.26.a:0 "The Nationalists appease the Country Party and reform the coalition."
austral.26.b:0 "The County Party is able to take primacy of the coalition."
austral.26.c:0 "The Nationalists are unable to put the Country Party in its place and the coalition breaks."

austral.27.t:0 "The Parties Stabilise Ahead of the Election"
austral.27.d:0 "After months of political chaos, the major parties have finally ceased their infighting to prepare for the upcoming election. The Labor factions have fallen behind the dominant of the 3 and while running separate candidates have agreed to give supply to the major faction if they win while the Nationalists and Country Party have reached a tenuous peace. Meanwhile, the AFAL remains a significant threat, aiming to upend the established political order."
austral.27.a:0 "The ALP will compete"
austral.27.b:0 "Lang Labor will compete"
austral.27.c:0 "The SLP will compete"

austral.29.t:0 "The Party Revolts Against Fadden"
austral.29.d:0 "Earle Page's reaction to the new Nationalist leader has caused significant issues within the party. In response, a movement to remove him has gained traction. Archie Cameron emerges as a compromise candidate, lacking a strong base of his own but enjoying friendly relations with the McEwen and Fadden factions. This makes him an ideal replacement for Page, who has dominated the party for much of its time in government."
austral.29.a:0 "Page is able to put down this revolt."
austral.29.b:0 "Cameron is placed in charge."

austral.30.t:0 "New Zealand's Political Stage Takes Form"
austral.30.d:0 "After Nossworthy's fall, the Reform Party has stabilised under Gordon Coates. However, the party's failure to address the economic crisis has led to a loss of support. Voters are now gravitating towards the economically liberal and anti-interventionist United Party, as well as the increasingly popular Labour Party, which is gaining traction among the disaffected working class and may form government for the first time."
austral.30.a:0 "A 3 way race!"

austral.31.t:0 "The Treasurer's Retirement"
austral.31.d:0 "After losing his position as Treasurer through a no-confidence vote, Joseph Lyons resigned from his party. He has since been courted by a group of anti-Labor figures and businessmen in Melbourne, known simply as "The Group." This influential circle, including Staniforth Ricketson, Keith Murdoch, Robert Menzies, Daniel Mannix and Ambrose Pratt, is seeking to leverage Lyons' remaining goodwill with the public to weaken the ALP by having him endorse the Nationals. Ultimately, Lyons decides to endorse..."
austral.31.a:0 "Lyons stays loyal to his party and endorses the ALP."
austral.31.b:0 "The Nationalists are the only hope now."
austral.31.c:0 "Lyons decides to fall into obscurity."

austral.100.t:0 "New Socialist Agitation!"
austral.100.d:0 "There has been a recent upswing in the Socialist's campaign efforts, as they appear to have a great deal more money in the party coffers than previously thought possible. [Root.GetAdjective] police investigators suggest that the money is likely being funnelled through the [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] Council of Trade Unions, sent by the Union of Britain, as an effort to support radicals within the Labor Party... though there is no real evidence of that yet."
austral.100.a:0 "Foreign interference? Outrageous!"

austral.101.t:0 "The Election Arrives"
austral.101.d:0 "After weeks of canvassing and constant headlines the elections have finished. Local town halls fall silent as polls have closed, volunteers wait eagerly and results have been tallied. Now with the majority of votes, it's been declared through the airwaves in every home that..."

austral.102.c:0 "The Reform Party wins!"

austral.103.t:0 "Birdwood Retires and the New Governor General"
austral.103.d:0 "William Birdwood's tenure as Governor-General saw a vast expansion in powers available to the position, which he used to maintain order in Oceania at the expense of democracy and civil liberties. Birdwood, a British General from the Weltkrieg, was imposed upon [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] by an Empire fearful of revolt... but times have changed, and the newly-elected government could use this opportunity to replace him with a native [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], or replace him with the well-liked governor of New South Wales, Sir Alexander Hore-Ruthven. While this move would be popular with many, others have suggested that an opportunity exists to invite a member of the royal family to assume the role and thus put [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] more firmly within the sphere of the Empire and our fellow Entente allies. Another suggestion for Governor-General is former White Rajah Charles Vyner Brooke, who has been a famed socialiser in Sydney. Further New Zealander options such as George Monckton-Arundell and Cyril Newall, are also on the table who both serve as useful bridges across the Tasman to unite this nation. In the end it is chosen that the successor will be..."

The specifics of these points are that it will allow the federal government to legislate on a broad range of issues, including employment, health, education, and civil rights. Labor argued that centralised authority was essential for effective post-war reconstruction and ensuring equitable distribution of resources.

George Finey contributed but was dropped after three months for his antipathy to Jack Lang. Alex Gurney also worked as a political cartoonist for the paper, and Frederick A. Brown was the chief cartoonist from 1928 to 1930.\n\nDominated by Lang supporters, the paper has been the major sponsor of the New South Wales Rugby Football League premiership from 1934, with winners awarded the Labour Daily Cup.

In New South Wales Lang opposed this vestige of noble tyranny, spending his first ministry almost freeing the state from its binds, only to be stopped by other anti-democratic institutions.\n\nQueensland is the only state to remove the institution by forming suicide squads whose only goal was to dispense with it.

The order is one of the oldest in Britain, second only to England's Order of the Garter in precedence. The order's history may be more myth than fact but it was revived by James II in 1687 using it to reward Scottish peers who supported the king's political and religious aims, giving the order the motto 'Nemo me impune lacessit', No one harms me with impunity.\n\nMenzies's knighthood recognized his Scottish roots, with the Queen pronouncing his name as "Ming-iz," reflecting his Scottish heritage. Scottish identity and Presbyterianism are integral to Menzies's worldview being obsessed with Scottish history, culture, and the story of the Menzies clan. Menzies was extensively involved in organisations like the Melbourne Scots and the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne.\n\nThe Canberra Times reported the ceremony at a copy of St. Giles Cathedral's Thistle Chapel that was built in Ottawa, where Menzies, in green mantle and white-plumed hat, joined a procession of twelve knights, including the Duke of Edinburgh.

He initially worked as a carpenter and joiner, but his passion for workers' rights soon led him to become an active trade unionist and political organiser.\n\nGarden's early years in Australia were marked by his involvement in the Industrial Workers of the World, where he advocated for direct action and industrial unionism. His commitment to socialist principles was evident, and in 1920, he played a pivotal role in founding the Communist Party of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]. Garden served as the CPA's first General Secretary, helping to establish its organisational structure and political agenda.\n\nDespite his initial enthusiasm for communism, Garden's relationship with the CPA began to sour by the mid-1920s. He grew increasingly critical of the party's strict adherence to Bolshevik ideology after the fall of Lenin and its unwillingness to adapt to the [AST.GetAdjective] context. This disillusionment led him to break with the CPA and shift his focus towards more pragmatic and reformist approaches within the broader labour movement.\n\nGarden's break from the CPA did not diminish his influence. He became a key figure within the SLP and used his position in the trades hall and unions to benefit the working man, supporting the founding of the ACTU. In his biggest move Jock attempted to take the position of Prime minister with an open and proud socialist platform. With the obvious result of that run being clear now, Jock has taken the top job now, working to advance the class's struggle no matter what."

While the organisation had little impact itself it was the major to unify the pacific's worker movements. \n\n[AST_Australasia_or_Australia] played a prominent role in the PPTUS from its inception. The [AST.GetAdjective] Council of Trade Unions and other significant labour organisations actively participated. The Stance of White [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] was challenged on this stage and influenced many left wing unions of the ACTU to abandon the policy. Further the joining of this organisation caused the AWU to split and Denounced the ACTU causing the major split between the organisations that still lingers today.

They contended that statehood would allow for more tailored policies to support local agriculture, infrastructure, and economic development. The movement gained traction during periods of economic hardship, where the disconnect between regional needs and metropolitan policies became starkly apparent. With the Scullin federal and Lang state government such country dominated areas chaffed with the government causing a renewal in support for separation. Similarly, the New England State Independence League, located in the northern regions of New South Wales, pushed for self-governance to better address their specific challenges. This area, with its distinct cultural identity and economic base, often felt marginalised by decisions made in Sydney.\n\nAdvocates for independence believed that a separate state could more effectively manage local resources, support regional industries, and preserve their way of life. Detractors however have seen the movement as a grab for power by the pastoralists and graziers of the region attempting to use statehood to dominate federally while ignoring the rights of their workers. The Riverina and New England State Independence Leagues both had strong ties with the AFAL with an early allegiance between the two being a strong base of support in the election federally.

While the principles of free trade and economic liberalism are held as the highest virtues to create a unity of purpose, our government allows the operation of a handful of unions to operate as long as they work with their employers rather than fall into class conflict for the sake of the nation.\n\nThe working class make up many of the lower level street fighter roles in the early days of the guard, making up 20% of our men. Further certain unions and worker associations had supported us in the early 30s such as the Railway Services Association, Perwaymen Gangers and Metal Trade Employers Association along with Labor renegade George Waite and veteran Seamen's Union leader, Tom Walsh. The Railway Services Association, opposed to the leftist an Railways Union, had its secretary Bill Fletcher pledge in a meeting that 'about 90% of his union would ... stand behind the New Guard.'

This lack of central control has allowed various splinter groups to emerge, taking the New Guard's principles to extreme and often unpalatable lengths. One such group is the "Pack of Cards." Inspired by foreign radicalism, this group holds secret internal meetings to ensure anonymity, with members adopting pseudonyms based on playing cards (excluding queens). The group is led by a figure known as "the Joker" and initially starting with 49 members, its ranks have recently swelled. \n\nThe Pack of Cards engages in activities that go beyond mere oversight of the New Guard. Besides investigating perceived disloyalty and laxity within the main organisation, they have purportedly conducted targeted operations. Reports suggest they had been engaging in kidnappings and raids on police armouries.

austral.931.d:0 "The Association and League of National Security, both led by General Sir Thomas Blamey, were established to protect the nation from the spreading of syndicalism. The Association was founded by General Bridwood as an internal unit within the [AST.GetAdjective] army to ensure that there was a loyal sect of officers ready to protect the nation once the Junta ended. This slowly became the jurisdiction of General Blamey as Birdwood slowly retreated to the role as the governor General with age. \n\nThe League of National Security itself was a paramilitary organisation formed by Blamey in Victoria during his time as the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police. The group was composed of several senior army officers, including Col. Francis Derham, a Melbourne lawyer, and Lt. Col. Edmund Herring, later Chief Justice of Victoria. Some members had been members of the Old and New Guard, working as liaisons between the groups. Operating in Western Victoria primarily the group stood ready to respond to a catholic or syndicalist revolt.\n\nWith leadership of both these organisations they acted as Blameys two fists, one focusing on protecting social order while the other using the army to hold the nation together."

austral.932.d:0 "Field Marshal William Riddell Birdwood is a name that is synonymous with the Anzacs during the Great War and the short Junta that brought order back to our nation. Born in India in 1865, Birdwood had a distinguished military career that saw him serve in various British colonial campaigns before being appointed to command the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps in 1914. Under Birdwood's leadership, the ANZACs were renowned for their valour and resilience during the Gallipoli Campaign, a harrowing and ultimately ill-fated effort to open the Dardanelles. Despite the campaign's failure, Birdwood's ability to maintain morale and his close rapport with his troops earned him great respect and the affectionate nickname "Birdy" among the soldiers.\n\nAfter Gallipoli, Birdwood continued to lead the ANZACs on the Western Front, where his strategic acumen and leadership skills contributed to several key victories. While we lost the Great War post-war he stood as the only defender of the nation who held back the tide of syndicalism as it swept over Britain. Forcing the passing of the Consolidation of Resources Act as the antipode economies collapsed upon losing their closest trading partner his army kept order to ensure that parliamentary democracy could continue. Forming our Association to ensure that a sect of the army was prepared to act as he did, he laid the groundwork that we build on now. Perhaps his only failure was the relinquishing of power after his 4 years of rule as it seems only military rule can protect this nation."

Now, the Sinn Fein fifth column is found in our land as well. Birdwood and Billy Hughes both attempted to oppose such a rebellious mass, but in their revolt they almost spread their barbarism here. Many of the trade unionists and radical rabble were both Catholic and Irish, and while we never proved it, the LNS was sure that the parishes of western Victoria were stockpiling ammunition for their red allies. While the Catholic faith will be allowed in this nation, they will be put under scrutiny and have their loyalty tested to ensure that they stay loyal."

austral.936.d:0 "With the junta cemented and Blamey's reforms passing without the interference of bureaucracy, he has taken influence from his earlier work in his home state of Victoria. Serving as the Chief Commissioner of the Victorian Police, Blamey's tenure was one of reform and controversy. Appointed to bring order and discipline to a force plagued by inefficiency and corruption, Blamey implemented rigorous standards and modernised policing practices. He introduced new training programs, improved the professionalism of the force, and established specialised units to tackle emerging crime trends. Blamey's military background, having served with distinction in the Great War influenced his approach to leadership, emphasising hierarchy, discipline, and operational efficiency.\n\nDespite these achievements, Blamey's tenure was not without controversy. His authoritarian style and willingness to use force against striking workers and political demonstrators drew criticism from labor groups and civil libertarians. Blamey's involvement in several high-profile cases, including the infamous Hoddle Street shooting and the police response to the 1928 waterfront strike, further polarising public opinion. His tenure ended amid allegations of misconduct and political pressure, but Blamey's legacy in the Victorian Police remained significant, laying the groundwork for a more professional and effective police force in the state.\n\nNow, with the proper funding and the power to achieve his goals, Blamey has taken this chance to expand his policing system to the nation. New policing units have been raised, with many being given equipment from the ANZACs to ensure national peace remains intact."

The article claimed soldiers and police officers had been turning a blind eye to certain brothels if they sacrificed the occasional worker to be arrested to maintain the appearance of law and order. Further rumours of Blamey purposely ignoring these actions have been circulating. Blamey's own history of controversy in the Victorian Police Department, with the discovery of his badge on a man in the brothel along with the disregarding of bar lockouts, has been discussed.

austral.938.d:0 "The [AST.GetAdjective] military has traditionally had a strong political dimension, shaped by the high-born officer class with ties to the British Empire. This dynamic intensified after the brief leadership of Birdwood, leading to a fractured military environment where various cliques vied for promotion and influence. Among the prominent generals competing for advancement were Sir Gordon Bennet, Sir Henry Lavarack, and, most notably, Sir Thomas Blamey. Each of these leaders had distinct political ambitions and rivalries that created significant friction within the ranks.\n\nThe Old Guard, a paramilitary group with links to the Citizen Military Forces and the Volunteer Defence Corps, lacked the influence to make a substantial impact during this period. Additionally, Bernard Freyberg, based in New Zealand, was somewhat sidelined and overlooked for top positions.\n\nBlamey, positioned above his rivals, skillfully entrenched himself with the establishment. While Bennet and Lavarack publicly criticised the government, Blamey maintained a more cautious approach, keeping his opinions private. This strategy endeared him to national decision-makers and secured his position. Furthermore, Blamey controlled the Association established by Birdwood, which provided him with a loyal and well-funded support base.\n\nWith civilian governance coming to an end, Blamey's rivals have been effectively sidelined. This consolidation of power under Blamey has paved the way for the development of a cohesive and modern military force, free from the internal divisions that had previously hampered its effectiveness."

Since sugar first arrived in [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] with the First Fleet and was established as a proper industry in 1862 by Captain Louis Hope, this cash crop has faced the constant pest of cane beetles. Establishing itself as a proper industry in north Queensland in the 1880s, the threat of native beetles, who use the crop to feed their larvae, along with droughts, had cut into the profits of these farmers. In response to this threat, the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations was established in 1900 to address the problem through experimentation with various chemical pest control methods. In 1932, the Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations' plant pathologist Arthur Bell attended a conference in Puerto Rico, where he learned of, and then reported on, the apparent success of an American toad species in reducing populations of cane beetles. Further, in 1934, the group obtained a breeding sample from Hawaii, which had introduced the species from Puerto Rico. This breeding sample, now numbering 2,400, was released in August of that year with little result. Walter Froggatt, a prominent entomologist, has been the main opposition to any further releases, writing that 'This great toad, immune from enemies, omnivorous in its habits, and breeding all year round, may become as great a pest as the rabbit or cactus,' in The [AST.GetAdjective] Naturalist, vol. 9.

austral.1010.t:0 "Rabbit Plagues Grow in Strength"
austral.1010.d:0 "Recent reports have identified a dangerous growth in the population of rabbits plaguing New South Wales and Victoria traced back to the 1932 outbreak. Rabbits were first introduced to Australia in 1788 for food. By 1827, a Tasmanian newspaper noted their proliferation on large estates. In 1857-1858, Alexander Buchanan, overseer for F. H. Dutton's Anlaby Estate in South Australia, released rabbits for hunting. Their population remained stable until 1866, likely controlled by native predators and protected by an Act of Parliament. However, by 1867, the population was out of control. The current infestation is mainly traced back to Thomas Austin, who released 24 wild rabbits in October 1859 on his property near Winchelsea, Victoria, for hunting. These rabbits spread rapidly due to ideal conditions in [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], including mild winters and widespread farming, which created suitable habitats. Within 10 years of their introduction, rabbits became so prevalent that two million could be shot or trapped annually without impacting the population. This was the fastest spread of any mammal ever recorded. Today, rabbits are entrenched in southern and central [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], with scattered populations in the northern deserts. In 1932-1933, large numbers of rabbits caused significant damage to crops and feed in parts of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria. These rabbits were where the economic consequences of the depression meant that the ability to counteract their growth was only found in the unemployed and hungry who hunted them for sustenance.\n\nNow with the recent uptick the only light in the tunnel has been a recent development by [AST.GetAdjective] scientist Jean Macnamara whose research on the myxoma virus for rabbit control has borne fruit. After bringing her data to Ottawa, fellow scientist Charles Martin's tests have shown that the virus is harmless to other wildlife, livestock, and humans.

Known for its distinctive striped back, the thylacine was a nocturnal predator that primarily hunted small to medium-sized animals. Despite being a formidable hunter, it fell victim to human activities. European settlers viewed the thylacine as a threat to livestock and hunted it extensively. Bounty schemes introduced in the 1830s accelerated their decline. By the early 20th century, sightings were rare, and the species was considered critically endangered. Efforts to protect the thylacine came too late. Habitat destruction and relentless hunting had taken their toll.

Until now, the idea of the "doomed race" has prevailed in official circles and across [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] generally. However, after years of unlikely perseverance, this idea can no longer continue. The government has decreed that Aboriginal [AST.GetAdjective]s have a future that must be planned for accordingly. The conference was dominated by experienced heads of frontier administrations, with the issue of people of mixed race being a burning topic. Cecil Cook from the Northern Territory feared that those of mixed descent would "taint" White [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] and stood for no change in policy. John Beakley believed that intermixing would not work and that a well-resourced segregated reserve system based on Queensland's expansive and highest funded system in the country is the solution. Auber Neville from Western Australia believed the two races could successfully merge over several generations, representing a "racial takeover" by absorbing Aboriginal people into the white race. Neville's view has determined that "the destiny of the natives of Aboriginal origin, but not of full blood, lies in their ultimate absorption by the peoples of the Commonwealth and it therefore recommends that all efforts be directed to that end." The policy promotes both equality and cultural assimilation, with administrators believing such a policy is progressive and will allow some semblance of native culture to be preserved."

A crowd of 35000 was enjoying the surf with waves breaking evenly about 100 feet off shore and at about 3.00 p.m. two duty patrols were changing shifts at the Bondi surf club and some 60 club members were mingling around waiting for the weekly surf competition. Suddenly, three tremendous waves rolled onto the beach in such quick succession that the water could not recede. When a sufficient lull in the wave cycle did eventuate, the massive backwash was phenomenal and swimmers were swept into a deep channel and out to sea. Lifesavers leapt into action, manning the seven reels already on the beach, and grabbing rubber surf floats, surf boards and skis, or swimming into the turmoil without belts and only their surfing skill to help them. The surf clubhouse began to resemble a hospital emergency ward as the rescued were brought in. About 30 were resuscitated on the beach while others were rushed to hospital. After some 30 long agonising minutes the water was cleared. It was time to count the cost. Approximately 250 bathers required assistance; 150 were rescued unharmed; 60 were suffering from immersion; 35 were rescued unconscious and revived; and five people were dead.\n\nThis tragic event highlights the need for improved beach safety measures and solidifies the importance of the Surf Life Saving movement.

Her personal life was unconventional; she was known to wear pistols even in her old age and was prepared to use them to threaten police when she caught them mistreating 'her' Aborigines. Bates was also famed for her strict lifelong adherence to Edwardian fashion, including boots, gloves, and a veil. \n\nIn addition to her extensive fieldwork and welfare efforts, Daisy Bates authored "The Passing of the Aborigines," a significant work documenting her experiences and observations. This book has become a crucial resource for understanding Aboriginal cultures and the challenges they faced during her lifetime.

However, once allocated to his battalion, Saunders reverted to the rank of private. He participated in a devastating bayonet charge, halting the enemy advance and resulting in nearly 300 enemy casualties.\n\nWhile performing rearguard actions, his battalion became separated from the main army.

Saunders remained hidden for eleven months before being rescued by submarine.\n\nAfter his rescue, Saunders returned to the army and was again promoted to temporary sergeant to lead his reformed platoon after its commander was wounded in action. His leadership impressed his commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Guinn, who recommended him for a commission.

austral.1059.d:0 "Industrial groups have been formed by catholic and anti-syndicalist workers to combat the influence of Langites and syndicalists in mainstream unions.These industrial groups, led by figures like B.A. Santamaria and his "Groupers," aimed to counteract these influences and promote conservative economic policies while expanding Santamaria's own control over the Labor Party.\n\nB.A. Santamaria is a prominent Catholic anti-communist activist who was one of Dr Daniel Mannix's most loyal followers.. His "Groupers," formally known as the Industrial Groups, were established within the [AST.GetAdjective] labour movement. Their primary goal was to rid trade unions of 'red' influence, which they believed was detrimental to both the unions and the broader [AST.GetAdjective] society.\n\nThe Groupers infiltrated various trade unions, organising themselves to gain control over union leadership and policies. They were particularly active in the [AST.GetAdjective] Labor Party, where they sought to curb the power of sympathisers and steer the party towards more moderate and conservative positions.\n\nThese efforts have not been met with weakness however, all unions have begun an effort to root out these infiltrators no matter the political position. The AWU lead by known anti-syndicalist and conservative Tom Doughtety has treated these groupers the same as he treated the reds who entered his union, ruthlessly purging them to guard his own power. The Mainstream ACTU has had different approaches across the different unions with left wing leaders meeting these with force while more right wing leaders have attempted to make deals and utilise the groupers against the left wing factions."

This rare and significant trophy, one of only 20 A7V tanks built by Germany, was captured during a fierce battle near Villers-Bretonneux in France in April 1918.\n\nThe capture of Mephisto was a remarkable feat with the A7V, a formidable weapon of war, was an armoured behemoth equipped with a 57mm Maxim-Nordenfelt gun and six MG08 machine guns. It played a key role in Germany's attempts to break through Allied lines during the Spring Offensive of 1918. However, during the battle near Villers-Bretonneux, Mephisto became bogged down in a shell crater, making it an easy target for the [AST.GetAdjective] troops.\n\nRecognizing the significance of capturing an intact enemy tank, the [AST.GetAdjective] soldiers undertook the dangerous task of securing Mephisto from the battlefield. The operation to retrieve the tank was fraught with peril, as the area was still under heavy artillery fire and surrounded by enemy forces. Despite these challenges, the [AST.GetAdjective]s successfully towed Mephisto to their lines, showcasing their resourcefulness and determination.\n\nMephisto is now displayed in the Queensland Museum of Brisbane, a testament to the queenslanders who recovered it.

As Archbishop of Melbourne from 1917, he played a crucial role in the nation's catholic minority.\n\nMannix's vehement opposition to conscription during World War I made him a key figure in the anti-conscription movement. He believed in individual freedom and was concerned for the working-class men who would be drafted. His support for Irish independence, including the Easter Rising and subsequent struggles, won admiration among Irish [AST.GetAdjective]s but also brought conflict with British authorities. The largest of his opposition was the Prime Minister of the time Billy Hughes who in response kicked off a anti-Catholic scare, building a resentment between the anglo-saxon Protestants and the irish catholics that stained the post war years.\n\nBeyond politics, Mannix advocated for social justice, speaking out against the exploitation of workers and supporting better working conditions and wages.

More toads were released around Ingham, Ayr, Mackay, and Bundaberg. While their spread has been slow, rumours of the toads appearing in Brisbane have swelled fears that the species will become a pervasive pest. Further ecological reports by anthropologists and farmers have indicated that the beetles the toads were supposed to control have seen little impact. The cause is suspected to be that the beetles are native [AST.GetAdjective] species, different from those causing problems in Hawaii and Puerto Rico. \n\nIn areas with high cane toad populations, there has been a significant loss in native predator populations due to the natural poison secreted by the toads, which kills predators not adapted to its toxicity. Additionally, the rapid multiplication of the cane toad population has led to many native species being unable to compete for the same food sources, leading to their decline.Currently, with their population mostly secluded in the cane capitals of Queensland, no state has recognized them as a major problem.

This led to a strike that halted company boats, resulting in the imprisonment of at least 30 strikers.\n\nIn late February, pay increases were offered to the workers, but these were rejected as the strike was also about demanding respect, equality, and self-determination for Torres Strait Islander people. After several months, McLean was forced to leave the islands, which was celebrated by the strikers.\n\nNow with no other choice the government has made significant concessions to the strikers. The nightly curfew is abolished, wages are increased, and the practice of paying in credit ended. Islanders have gained the right to choose their own crews and control their own boats.

However, with the recent push for federalization, this question has become a hot-button issue across the Tasman.\n\nThe contrast in the treatment of native populations has caused unease in the New Zealand government and among Māori, who fear that absorption would lead to a loss of rights. This tension was further agitated when the immigration minister attempted to deport three Tongan women, justifying the action by claiming that Māori and islanders fall under the same policy, causing outrage in New Zealand and challenging its autonomy.\n\nDuring the original push for federalization in the 19th century, a similar issue arose. Advocates for New Zealand's federalization argued for the racial superiority of Māori over Aboriginal [AST.GetAdjective]s to justify different treatment. As the recent deportation incident highlighted this issue, a clear policy is required\n\nAs [AST.GetAdjective] states have the right to define their own policies regarding Aboriginal populations, New Zealand would be able to continue its policy with the Māori.

austral.1118.t:0 "History of the SLP"
austral.1118.d:0 "The Socialist Labor Party traces its roots to the Australian Socialist League, founded in 1887 in New South Wales. Initially composed of Modern Socialists, Scientific Socialists, and Libertarian Anarchists, the ASL influenced major labor strikes, such as the 1890 Maritime strike and the 1891 Australian shearers' strike.\n\nIn 1901, dissatisfied with the Labor Party's moderate stance, the ASL established the SLP to contest federal elections. Although the SLP didn't win seats, it introduced the Industrial Workers of the World to Australia and played a significant role in labor movements. By 1920, the SLP merged with the Industrial Socialist Labor Party, gaining political power when Percy Brookfield won the seat of Sturt in the New South Wales state election.\n\nWith the victory of the English revolution while surging in popularity the party also faced increased repression, being targeted with the IWW by the Birdwood - Hughes government. Jock, having left the Communist Party and banned from the Labor Party, joined the SLP. Despite Ernie Judd's leadership, Jock's influence in the unions and the Trades Hall made him the new leader in 1931. The SLP re-emerged in the same election that saw Scullin win, securing three seats and expanding to five as dissatisfaction with the Lyons plan grew. When Beasly withdrew support so did Jock causing the collapse of the Labor Party, with many more socialist minded members of the ALP splitting to join the party."

austral.1119.d:0 "Founded in 1906 in Melbourne, the Victorian Socialist Party was a notable socialist party that operated in Victoria. Led by the likes of Tom Mann and Robert Samuel Ross, it also featured many notable figures such as John Curtin in the Labor Party, with a faction of the VSP hoping to "bore from within" and win the ALP for socialism. The VSP focused on socialist education and community-building activities rather than contesting parliamentary elections.\n\nIts leadership of the Melbourne Commune sounded the death bells for the party however as it was ruthlessly crushed by the government. While remembered now as an early form of [AST.GetAdjective] socialism it resmed little of the nation's new system, "the Party's socialism in reality involved a loosely integrated body of ideas, largely British in origin or form".

Judd's leadership marked a period of growth and increased political activity for the SLP as it coincided with the revolution in england. Under his guidance, the party navigated through intense repression from the Birdwood-Hughes government, which targeted both the SLP and the Industrial Workers of the World, almost breaking both. Judd's ability to maintain party cohesion and morale during these difficult times was instrumental in the party's survival and subsequent resurgence.\n\nDespite this before the party could reemerge Jock Garden joined the party in 1926, utilising his expert organising skills to both keep the union afloat and grow his power within. Before the election 1931 Jock striked, utilising his wide support from communists, unionists and his dominance in the trades hall to replace Judd, making him his deputy. With the success of the SLP and the victory of the revolution this unresolved conflict had been ignored however with the stabilisation Judd has made an attempt to take back his party, utising the Anarchist and Anarcho communist faction that had been sidelined by Jock's ascendance."

Known for their intellectual rigour and commitment to free speech, the Sydney Libertarians have in many ways split from the party, challenging the prevailing political and social norms of the post-revolutionary state. They organise public forums, debates, and lectures, providing a platform for diverse and often controversial viewpoints. \n\nTheir activities attracted a mix of students, intellectuals, and activists, fostering a vibrant community of radical thinkers in Sydney. One aspect that has garnered interest is the social aspect, being situated often in bars the movement has been described as futilitarian, spending their time drinking, thinking, grieving and reading. The movement itself has been rejected by the unions and socialist parties as intellectual drivel divorced from reality, with even anarchists mocking their impotence and escapism due to the movement's belief that it should not enforce their beliefs on anyone."

Joe Hill's contributions to the labor movement have extended beyond his lifetime through his songs, which were published alongside other IWW compositions in the "Little Red Songbook." \n\nThe emotional and motivational power of these songs is evident in the letters from Charlie Reeve, an IWW member who found comfort in singing them softly to himself while imprisoned. Another instance was during the prosecution of 11 IWW members in Perth in 1917, a Joe Hill song was read out in court as evidence of the organisation's supposed subversive activities, highlighting the Hugh';s governments fear of the IWW.\n\nProminent [AST.GetAdjective] writers and poets also contributed to the radical tradition inspired by the IWW. Mary Gilmore, a notable critic of the capitalist system, used her poetry to lambast the injustices faced by workers. Bill Casey, an IWW member who later became Queensland secretary of the Seamen's Union of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], authored "Bump Me into Parliament," a song that criticised the political establishment and expressed anti-conscription sentiments during World War I. This song, among others, was included in a pamphlet titled "Anti-Conscription Army Songs," which was widely distributed and even inserted into the Melbourne telephone directory in 1918.

In Australia, the IWW formed out of the Socialist Labor Party and openly scorned parliamentary democracy, calling for the overthrow of the bosses and establishing worker controlled society. Fighting to create a system of 'One Big Union' to represent the workers across industrial lines, many industrial unions were amalgamated to a militant core of the working class. It was the great war where the union faced its toughest times, when opposing conscription and the war the union became targets of Billy 'the Rat' Hughes. Jailing its members and banning the organisation the IWW almost was destroyed as many members left to join other unions or the Labor party. \n\nIf it was not for Violet Wilkins, who continued campaigning and supporting the union, it would have died in those days. With the revolution in England syndicalists flocked to the movement again and while pursued by the Birdwood Junta it only grew in size and with the reemergence of its sister organisation the SLP, began agitating once again.

He was later re-arrested in Sydney in 1917 and sentenced to six months of hard labor. Despite facing media harassment and political suppression, he continued to promote socialist and anarchist ideas.

It was this trial and imprisonment of the Sydney Twelve the movement was almost wiped out with Donald Grant personally being one of the men jailed.\n\nThe charges against the Sydney Twelve were widely regarded as politically motivated, aimed at crippling the IWW's influence.

Key unions in the militant faction of the ACTU include the Federated Ironworkers Association, Seamen's Union, Miners' Federation, Waterside Workers' Federation, Building Labourers Federation, Building Workers Industrial Union, and Operative Painters and Decorators Union. While the ACTU remains a federated structure, moderates support the syndicalists now dominating the executive, though some chafe under this new leadership.\n\nBig Jim Healy leads the influential Waterside Workers' Federation, representing dock workers and longshoremen. The Building Labourers Federation, led by Dick Surplus, and the Building Workers Industrial Union, led by Frank Purse, form a militant partnership representing construction workers. Ernie Thornton leads the Federated Ironworkers Association, which represents iron and steel workers and was heavily influenced by the IWW, nearly merging with it in 1919. The Seamen's Union, led by Eliot Valens Elliott, is another key militant union representing maritime workers and closely collaborates with the WWF.

With the amalgamation of various building industry unions beginning in the 1930s, the union would relaunch with the new name of Building Workers' Industrial Union, now made up of plasterers', painters', labourers', carpenters' and bricklayers' unions. \n\nThe BLFs origins can be traced back to 1911, led by its first federal president Ted Jones. The union's branch in Queensland grew to be the strongest, collaborating with the most progressive in the country under T. J. Ryan's Queensland Labor government. Making deals to not strike in turn with better wages and improved living standards, the relationship served as an inspiration for further progressive arbitration. With the growth of the BWIU there was enthusiasm here to join the BLF with the BWIU however the right faction leading the federal union denied these attempts.\n\nBoth unions were devastated by the post-war depression. Membership numbers plummeted as unemployment soared, and many labourers struggled to maintain their livelihoods. The early 1930s saw a resurgence of left-wing leadership within the BLF, with figures like Fred Jackson and later, the current leader, Dick Surplus taking the helm. Under their leadership, the union focused on proletarian consciousness and educating members against the outdated craft unionism. By the late 1930s, the unions had achieved significant gains in membership and financial stability thanks to their leadership. However, the union's militancy was tempered as job action received less emphasis under the new regime. \n\nWith Dick Surplus stood Frank Henry Leslie Purse, who emerged as a significant figure in the BWIU during the mid-20th century. Born in 1906, Purse became active in the Bricklayers' Union in the early 1930s and quickly rose through the ranks. Now federal secretary of the BWIU he is instrumental in promoting the union's agenda on both national and international stages, being the second in command of Jim Healy and the militant ACTU.

The unit developed out of the WWF Sydney Branch with Levy, Gow and Disher all involved in the New Theatre, which was established in 1932 as the Sydney Workers' Art Club. The latest film is 'The Hungry Miles', which told the story of the Federation's industrial conflicts against the backdrop of the depression after the Great War and the loathed labour hire system known as the Bull System, that operated on the waterfronts for much of the early 1900s, prior to the introduction of the Gang System.

The ACTU was created as a federated structure, bringing together state-based labor councils and industrial unions to coordinate and strengthen the collective bargaining power of workers at a national level. This centralization was especially crucial in the face of the economic instability and industrial disputes of the 1920s, with Birdwoods Junta attempting union busting across all of [AST.GetAdjective] society. \n\nA key figure in the ACTU's early history was Albert Monk, who served as president from 1934 to 1943.

This position then lead to his work to become the president of Trades Hall Council which led to his presidency at the ACTU, the Amalgamated Food Preservers' Union of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] and the Federated Storemen and Packers' Union of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]. As president, Monk was particularly skilled at navigating the tensions between the moderate and militant factions within the ACTU. Maintaining a delicate balance that kept the federation cohesive he left the ALP to support the SLP due to majority vote despite his own moderate position.\n\nThe moderate unions are a combination of industrial and craft unions, including the [AST.GetAdjective] Teachers' Federation, [AST.GetAdjective] Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, Amalgamated Engineering Union, Hospital Employees' Association of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], [AST.GetAdjective] Insurance Staffs' Federation, the Amalgamated Food Preservers' Union of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] and the Federated Storemen and Packers' Union of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] and Electrical Trades Union of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia]. The name Moderate may be a misnomer with many of these unions sharing positions similar to the militant factions, supporting a union run economy and political scene, what unites them is an opposition to establishing a complete syndicalist society.

austral.1153.d:0 "In April 1930, the Unemployed Workers Movement was formed in Melbourne following a dispute between the Victorian Trades Hall Council and a group of unemployed workers who demanded representation. Rejected by the council, these activists, supported by the Communist Party of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia], founded the UWM as part of a larger campaign to radicalise [AST.GetAdjective] workers. Although Communists were a minority within the UWM, the organisation aimed to represent the interests of the unemployed and fight against evictions.\n\nDespite its allegiance to the CPA, the UWM often collaborated with ALP organisations at the community level, defying party lines to achieve its goals. The movement expanded nationally, establishing branches across Sydney and Newcastle, and engaged in actions to prevent evictions from 1930 to 1932. From 1931 to 1932, the Unemployed Workers Movement engaged in increasingly confrontational and violent battles with the New South Wales Police Force to prevent evictions. By February 1932, the UWM had successfully won over 200 eviction cases, celebrating their victories with rallies that sometimes resulted in violent confrontations, such as the ambush by the New Guard.\n\nDespite their successes, the UWM faced continuous friction with trade unions, which refused to represent them, leading to disruptions of trade union meetings and marches. By the end of 1932 the group was broken down by the constant pressure of the Bruce government; however for a brief time the unemployed bared their teeth. With new support programs for the unemployed and a commitment to ending hunger we continue their fight!"

Raised by his elder brother in Liverpool, Kavanagh's rudimentary Catholic education led him to view organised religion as a danger to the working class. After several unskilled jobs, he enlisted in the King's Royal Rifle Corps in 1898, serving in Ireland and fighting in the South African War from 1900 to 1902. He was invalided home with a shrapnel wound and discharged as a corporal in 1906.\n\nIn 1907, Kavanagh emigrated to Canada, settling in Vancouver, where he learned tile-laying and joined the Socialist Party of Canada. Immersed in Marxist theory, he became an active member of trades and labor organisations, working on the wharves from 1917. In 1921, he played a key role in founding the underground Communist Party of Canada. Kavanagh's personal life saw him with a daughter from his first wife Hilda, and another daughter from his second wife Louise, who passed away in 1919.\n\nIn 1925, Kavanagh and his companion Edna Louise Hungerford, along with his elder daughter and Edna's son, sailed for [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] under the surname Kavanagh, arriving in Sydney on May Day. His arrival was quickly noted by local authorities, who reported that his "oratory and knowledge of Marxist principles" had a significant impact on the small and poorly organised Communist Party of [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] abandoned by Jock Garden.

He was the only child of John Balfour Clement Miles, a wealthy public accountant, and his English-born wife Ellen. Miles joined his father's firm, Miles, Vane & Miles, and became a fellow of the [AST.GetAdjective] Corporation of Public Accountants. By 1912, he was practising as an independent consulting accountant and held directorships in several companies, including the Sydney Meat Preserving Co. Ltd and British General Electric Co. Ltd.\n\nAround 1912, Miles co-founded the Rationalist Press Association's local branch and published the Sydney Rationalist Annual in 1914. He opposed conscription for overseas service and was active in the referendum campaigns of 1916 and 1917. In 1917, he established the Advance [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] League, promoting the slogan '[AST_Australasia_or_Australia] first' and opposing Imperial Federation. After leaving the rationalist association in 1920, he focused on business until his retirement in 1935. \n\nImpressed by Percy Stephensen, whom he employed as a literary adviser, Miles began funding and editing Miles's paper the Publicist from July 1936. The monthly publication promoted a range of controversial views, including pro-mosleyite, pro-Aboriginal, anti-British and anti-socialist sentiments. Through the Publicist, Miles supported Stephensen's [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] First Movement, which advocated for a distinct Australian identity free from British influence. This collaboration led to the publication of notable works like Stephensen's The Foundations of Culture in Australia and Xavier Herbert's Capricornia. Miles's financial backing extended to the Aborigines' Progressive Association, formed by William Ferguson and Jack Patten, aligning with his broader agenda of [AST.GetAdjective] nationalism.

Published in 1936, the essay critiques the colonial mindset that dominated Australian society and calls for a break from British cultural dominance. Stephensen argues that for Australia to achieve true independence, it must cultivate its own cultural identity, rooted in the local landscape and Indigenous heritage. He emphasises the need for Australians to embrace their own history, environment, and cultural experiences, rather than mimicking British traditions.\n\nStephensen's essay also highlights the importance of recognizing and incorporating Indigenous Australian culture as a vital component of national identity. He asserts that Indigenous cultures possess a richness and depth that can significantly contribute to the formation of a unique Australian cultural consciousness. Foundations of Culture in Australia served as a manifesto for the cultural nationalist movement, inspiring a set of writers, artists, and intellectuals to explore and celebrate Australian culture, centred with the Jindyworobaks.

Born in Victoria, Mills pursued a career in law, but his interests extended far beyond the legal realm. He became captivated by the ancient Norse mythology and pagan traditions, which he believed held profound spiritual truths. His fascination led him to establish the First Anglecyn Church of Odin in the early 1930s, promoting a religious movement that sought to resurrect the worship of the Norse gods in a modern context. Mills saw this revival as a means to restore what he viewed as a more authentic and spiritually rich connection to the past, free from the influences of contemporary Christianity.\n\nThe Anglican Church of Odin, as Mills' movement was sometimes known, aimed to provide a structured religious framework for the worship of the Norse pantheon, particularly Odin, the chief god. Mills authored several books outlining his beliefs and practices, including 'The First Guide Book to the Anglecyn Church of Odin' and 'The Odinist Religion: Overcoming Jewish Christianity,' where he delineated the rituals, moral codes, and philosophical underpinnings of his faith. Joining the AFM his writings gained popularity as it was posted in the publicist, building on the growing the anti-semitism of Percy Stephensen.

His outspoken nature and commitment to workers' rights led to his near deportation during the early 1920s. Despite this setback, Walsh's resilience and dedication to the labour movement saw him rise to prominence becoming General secretary of the Seamen's Union.\n\nHis leadership extended beyond labor rights, as he was also involved in broader social justice issues, including anti-conscription campaigns during World War I. Walsh however, with his wife, moved right after the founding of the CPA and the period of the Birdwood's junta. Moving to instead look for a class collaborator approach to the union he was deposed as a boss's man. Becoming a journalist he was drawn to the publicist and worked there with his wife. Synthesising his collaborationist unionism with the Maximist ideal Walsh found a new malleable ideology, working with many right wing unions and worker associations to build a nationalist front connected with the New Guard while also supporting the Mosley supporting AFM.

With Lenin's loss however, Adela's enthusiasm for communism waned and she shifted towards more nationalistic views. Now founding the [AST.GetAdjective] Women's Guild of Empire in 1927 to combat syndicalism and uphold Christian ideals, she followed a new path of advancing the feminist cause. Throughout the 1930s, Adela changed further, now inspired by the writings of Oswald Mosley, which synthesised both her nationalism as well as her socialist past. With Percy Stephensen's publishing of Mosleyite literature in the 'Publicist' they united, forming the [AST_Australasia_or_Australia] First movement.

Merging with five other leading brewing companies to form Carlton & United Brewing, or CUB, in 1907, Foster's Lager was propped up as CUB's premier, luxury brand, with the brand becoming a favourite among millions in the decades since, being exported across the Anglosphere, primarily in Australia and America, as well as to Australian troops serving in the Great War and elsewhere.

austral.3364.d:0 "Although they possess a long history of varied artistic traditions, few if any Aboriginal artists have been able to break into the mainstream - that is none have until Albert Elea Namatjira. Getting his start in 1934 thanks to the help of fellow Melbourne-based painters Rex Battarbee and John Gardner, Namatjira learned from them while developing his own unique and syncretic style that focused on the landscapes and flora of the Outback such as the white gum trees he so loved to paint. Despite his 'controversial' racial background as an Aboriginal, which has led him to be shunned by some, many of Namatjira's pieces have been able to reach widespread popularity and acclaim, such as 1936's 'Central Australian Landscape', which shows a land of rolling green hills, or 1937's 'Ajantzi Waterhole' which shows a close up view of a small waterhole, with Namatjira capturing the reflection in the water. Further popular pieces have been 1938's Red Bluff that shows a field of red and green forested hills, or his most recent piece 'Central Australian Gorge' which further shows his ability to use the landscape to depict a space of beautiful, colourful contrast which has been aided by his ability to successfully and skillfully fuse his Western artistic influences with his Aboriginal artistic traditions. Selling out a recent art exhibition in Sydney, Namatjira is more popular than pretty much any other artist in the country right now, proving that art transcends culture and race in the eyes of many. However, some critics coming from both White and Aboriginal sources claim that Namatjira's art style is a cheap and soulless facsimile of European-style art, being a product of his assimilation to Western culture as opposed to his own connection to his subject matter or his natural style, though many have decried these views as petty attempts to belittle Namatjira's raw natural talent and effortless ability to fuse his influences seamlessly.

Coming out the gate loudly in support of the Māori leader Te Kooti and his syncretic Ringatū faith and sticking to that grift for a few years while pursuing his own failed Christian socialist political career before migrating to Sydney where he fell in with the local labour movement. While in Sydney, he became an associate of Billy Hughes and even Jack Lang before once again emigrating, this time to the United States - choosing America over South Africa after failing an attempt at being recruited by Cecil Rhodes - in order to finish his political treatise 'Might is Right' in secret, publishing it in 1896 under the pen name Ragnar Redbeard after first starting it and releasing draft versions of it in 1890, getting it printed and published in Chicago, finally being inspired to expand and finish it after failed parliamentary bids and revolutionary action in New Zealand and Australia on his socialist and Christian moralist platform. The work represented a hard shift in Desmond's ideology, instead focusing on Social Darwinism, amoralism, egoism and the works of Nietzsche, individualist anarchism, consequentialism, anti-Christian and anti-Semitic rhetoric, and psychological hedonism, espousing the idea that power, strength, and dominance are the mark of a superior being, and that inherent human rights are nonexistent while framing the wider work as a negation of the Ten Commandments, the Golden Rule, Republicanism, Christian Principles, and the Sermon on the Mount. However, this work would not be his last, for Desmond continued his poetry career as well thanks to Henry Lawson - Australia's greatest short story writer - and their close friendship, whose guidance helped honed Desmond's ability as a writer as he further delved into extremist philosophies and fringe socialist ideologies, while bouncing around Australasia and America as the situation deteriorated in his adopted homeland while also claiming to serve in the Boer Wars and a numerous other dubious claims before he finally croaked in his retirement home in Illinois. \n\nAlthough he died in 1929 in a foreign land and though his past is shrouded in mystery and controversy, there are still those adamant few within our party that swear he wasn't entirely crazy and that he had some sound ideas, such as his advocacy of Social Darwinism or his paradoxical support for Maori and Aboriginal inclusion in mainline Australasian society. Should we finally and decisively move away from his name, or names, for good, or should we remain open to some of his less controversial views while honouring his life and his friendship with our party leader?"
austral.3365.a:0 "Let the crazy bogan rot and cleanse the party of his taint."
austral.3365.b:0 "He wasn't all mad. Honor Ragnar Redbeard's legacy."

austral.3366.t:0 "One Big Union's Greater Ambitions"
austral.3366.d:0 "The One Big Union movement seeks to unite all workers, regardless of trade or skill, under a singular, all-encompassing labor organization. Originating from the Western Federation of Miners in the U.S., this ideology gave birth to the American Labor Union, directly challenging the conservative American Federation of Labor. These efforts culminated in the creation of the Industrial Workers of the World, an organization whose ideals quickly spread across borders, most notably to Australia. While Daniel De Leon, a prominent socialist leader, was critical of the OBU concept, his influence over the Australian Socialist Labor Party pushed them to pursue this radical dream alongside the Australian IWW.\n\nInternationalism is at the core of the OBU ideology, and its global roots are undeniably tied to American socialism. As its ideological heirs, we must rekindle the spirit of OBU and remember its roots in the American heartland, where it all began - a tribute to the solidarity and revolutionary fervor that transcends borders."
austral.3366.a:0 "A toast to American Socialism and our brothers"
austral.3366.b:0 "As its inheritors we must bring OBU back to America by force"

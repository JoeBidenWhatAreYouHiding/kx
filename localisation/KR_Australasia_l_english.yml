### Ideas ###
AST_oversized_fleet:0 "Oversized Fleet"
AST_oversized_fleet_desc:0 "In the chaotic aftermath of Britain's downfall, many ships fled to Australasia to find refuge - far more than could be maintained in the country's meagre ports. Even with many ships mothballed (4 battleships, 2 armoured cruisers, and almost 50 smaller ships), it still is too much for Australia to handle. A solution needs to be found."
AST_upgrading_reserve:0 "Upgrading Naval Reserve"
AST_depression_1:0 "Economic Depression"
AST_depression_1_desc:0 "Australasia's economy was never particularly strong, and the aftermath of the Weltkrieg has only made it much, much worse. Opportunity is not present, and people cannot find jobs. Radicalisation is beginning to take root across the country as more extreme solutions begin to be considered."
AST_depression_2:0 "Recovering From Depression"
AST_depression_2_desc:0 "Australasia's economy was never particularly strong, and the aftermath of the Weltkrieg has only made it much, much worse. Opportunity is not present, and people cannot find jobs. Radicalisation is beginning to take root across the country as more extreme solutions begin to be considered."
AST_bled_dry:0 "Bled Dry"
AST_bled_dry_desc:0 "We gave everything we had in the Weltkrieg and then some, and it shows. Nearly everybody knew someone who died far from home for a war that meant nothing in the end and have no desire to see such a thing happen again, not unless it is absolutely necessary."
AST_anzac_spirit_1:0 "ANZAC Spirit"
AST_anzac_spirit_1_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Australian and New Zealanders were the most aggressive, and managed to keep their form in spite of their questionable discipline. Out of the line they were undoubtedly difficult to handle, but once in it they loved a fight. They were a curious mixture of toughness and sentimentality."
AST_anzac_spirit_2:0 "ANZAC Spirit"
AST_anzac_spirit_2_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Australian and New Zealanders were the most aggressive, and managed to keep their form in spite of their questionable discipline.

### Focuses ###
AST_democracy_prevails:0 "A Democratic Australasia"
AST_democracy_prevails_desc:0 "Democracy prevails in Australasia and, for the moment, power remains in the hands of parliament and thus the people. The challenges facing the nation are many, however, and freedom could all too easily slip from our hands if we are not careful."
AST_freedom_of_the_press:0 "Freedom of the Press"
AST_freedom_of_the_press_desc:0 "To better maintain its grip on the population, Birdwood's regime introduced censorship laws in 1926. Rescinding those laws is all but expected, now that the nation is once again democratic... though it has been a long time since Australasian newspapers have felt free to speak their mind. Hopefully they will remember who loosened their chains."
AST_trade_union_question:0 "Question of the Unions"
AST_trade_union_question_desc:0 "In the aftermath of the Melbourne Commune, trade unions were made illegal. While many are sceptical of their ideology, the continued draconian enforcement of Birdwood's policies is decidedly unpopular, and thus we must decide whether the unions have a place in modern Australasian society."
AST_lift_martial_law:0 "Lift Martial Law"
AST_lift_martial_law_desc:0 "Since the nation's formation, Australasia has in effect been under martial law. Now with democracy restored and power in the hands of Parliament, the government is in a position to restore civil liberties in Australasia."
AST_suppress_syndicalism:0 "Suppress the Syndicalists"
AST_suppress_syndicalism_desc:0 "The decision is clear: syndicalism is the greatest threat facing the nation, and thus the Australasian Council of Trade Unions must be suppressed with all force. Since the unions have fallen under the sway of these radicals, there can be no compromise."
AST_workers_deal:0 "Compromise With Labor"
AST_workers_deal_desc:0 "The time has come to recognise that Australasia's labour troubles are larger than the syndicalist radicals who try to stir up trouble. There are union leaders with whom we can negotiate, and in time it may be possible to work out a solution that makes for a fairer society as well as cuts the legs out from under the radicals."
AST_call_for_unity:0 "Call For Unity"
AST_call_for_unity_desc:0 "With the 1939 elections done and democracy having proven itself to be an enduring force in Australasia, the time has come to call on the people of Australasia to pull together and put past conflicts behind them. We must move forward as a nation, a single force that marches bravely into the new world."
AST_labour_resolved:0 "The Labor Threat is Over"
AST_labour_resolved_desc:0 "We have endured more than our fair share of labour conflict in the 20th Century, and the time has come to put that chapter of our history to a close."
AST_maori_act:0 "The Maori Act"
AST_maori_act_desc:0 "Much of the land owned by Maori in New Zealand is economically unproductive. Many are suggesting we turn these barren locations into fruitful sites of industry and commerce. The people of New Zealand are largely opposed to these proposals, however, and want Maori rights to these lands be guaranteed by law. A decision must soon be made as to which we consider more important."
AST_long_live_the_king:0 "Long Live the King!"
AST_long_live_the_king_desc:0 "The time has come to re-dedicate ourselves to the British Commonwealth and our place within it. While there are those who might suggest turning our backs on the crown, we say that we are now and shall always be a loyal subject of the King. Long live the Confederation!"
AST_increase_british_ties:0 "Increase British Ties"
AST_increase_british_ties_desc:0 "While we are no longer in need of direct rule by the British, we would be fools not to realise our future depends heavily on their aid. Let us ask for advisers to help forward our military research efforts, so that we may be a better part of the Entente alliance."
AST_australasian_republic:0 "Become a Republic"
AST_australasian_republic_desc:0 "It is true that we began as a colony of the British, and we will forever owe our origins to the Motherland. We cannot, however, ignore the heavy hand which the British have employed in our nation... and neither can our people. The time has come to respectfully disengage our political system from the trappings of parliamentary rule and become a republic in full."
AST_new_constitution:0 "A New Constitution"
AST_new_constitution_desc:0 "Becoming a republic has meant the raising of many questions regarding procedure and the rights of the individual citizen. The Australasian constitution will need to be re-written, and we can take this opportunity to forge the kind of government which will take us into the next century and beyond."
AST_we_march_forward:0 "We March Forward"
AST_we_march_forward_desc:0 "Let us celebrate our status as a free and just society, an Australasia that exists for all its citizens and which leaves none of them behind."

AST_syndicalist_victory:0 "Victory for the Syndicalists"
AST_syndicalist_victory_desc:0 "We have had to wrest victory from the hands of the capitalists, no longer will Australasians be expected to risk their lives to make this country a paradise for a few hundred, or a few thousand greedy, selfish millionaire families! Now the revolution has come to Australasia and we will not let our chance go to waste!"
AST_purge_army:0 "Purge the Army"
AST_purge_army_desc:0 "The first threat we face is from within: the army is replete with monarchist supporters and those who would stand against the workers. Even if it means a time of readjustment, we must reform the military and sack any and all of its leaders who refuse to support us."
AST_british_advisors:0 "Invite British Advisers"
AST_british_advisors_desc:0 "If there is a Britain to whom we should be loyal, let it be to the one who controls the home isles. The crown might call them traitors, but they are the British people! How can they betray themselves? Let us invite the Union of Britain to join us in marching together towards a new future."
AST_empower_ACTU:0 "Empower the ACTU"
AST_empower_ACTU_desc:0 "The Australasian Council of Trade Unions saw us to this point, sheltered the activists and the labour leaders even as they were being hunted down by the police. Now we shall lift them up and give them the power they deserve, a place to oversee the future and well-being of the Australasian worker."
AST_restore_order_1:0 "The Syndicalists Restore Order"
AST_restore_order_1_desc:0 "It has been a difficult road, but now the chaos must end. No more demonstrations, no more violence that cuts off our own nose to spite our face. The path forward lies with the revolution, and the nation must now face that fact."
AST_syndicalist_congress:0 "The Syndicalist Congress"
AST_syndicalist_congress_desc:0 "The ACTU Congress has seen the syndicalists remain in command. With our future clear, let us plan out future progress for the nation."
AST_establish_ASRC:0 "Establish the ASRC"
AST_establish_ASRC_desc:0 "The Australasian Syndicalist Revolutionary Council will oversee the implementation of our policies throughout the nation, changing the lives of every ordinary citizen... and also ensuring that no upstart radicals and monarchists gain a foothold in places of power. True freedom requires vigilance!"
AST_workers_unite:0 "Unite the Workers"
AST_workers_unite_desc:0 "So many decades of brainwashing have left many of the nation's workers unable to tell what truly lies in their own interests. We must make a concerted effort to re-educate and win them over to the syndicalist cause. The workers of Australasia must be united as a single force!"
AST_totalist_congress:0 "The Totalist Congress"
AST_totalist_congress_desc:0 "The ACTU Congress has seen the Maximists take their rightful place as captains of the revolution. Now it is time to stride forward and plot out our nation's future progress."
AST_seize_production:0 "Socialisation of the Nation"
AST_seize_production_desc:0 "Charting the economic future of the nation and its workers means we are prepared to exercise most vigorous and far-reaching control over the economy, to ensure that what is produced is exactly what the country needs."
AST_mobilize_revolution:0 "Mobilise the Revolution"
AST_mobilize_revolution_desc:0 "The workers of Australasia need to understand that holding onto their rights means defending the revolution. Indeed, we must export the revolution elsewhere. It is only when the workers of the entire world are free that we will be able to relax our guard."
AST_business_leaders:0 "The New Business Leaders"
AST_business_leaders_desc:0 "There is a curious perception that only capitalism can see civilian industry progress, and we must dispel that archaic notion. Business leaders must either be re-educated, or they must be put aside, as true productivity lies in the hands of the nation's workers."
AST_industrial_progress:0 "Progress in Industry"
AST_industrial_progress_desc:0 "Australasia will make a great leap forward in its industrial capacity, so that production and distribution will be developed in an orderly manner to ensure that our people could enjoy a steadily rising standard in material and cultural conditions."
AST_join_internationale:0 "Join the Internationale"
AST_join_internationale_desc:0 "The time has come to take our place amidst our brothers and sisters of the international syndicalist community. Together we shall be invincible!"

AST_AFM_victory:0 "Victory for the AFM"
AST_AFM_victory_desc:0 "The people have spoken, and now it is time for Australasia to turn its back on a history of colonial oversight and cruelty. No longer will we fight wars in distant lands that shed Australasian blood to no good purpose. Our destiny is our own, and we will not waste this opportunity!"
AST_total_control:0 "Seize Total Control"
AST_total_control_desc:0 "The first step in restoring order is in eliminating the endless debate and controversy that surrounds parliament. The AFM requires total control in order to enact its mandate, and if that means ending elections to impose much-needed reforms on the nation, then so be it! Rights and procedures can be re-introduced at a later date, once Australasia has been transformed."
AST_propaganda_effort:0 "Focus on Propaganda"
AST_propaganda_effort_desc:0 "There are far too many voices in the crowds who would seek to tear down our efforts before they even begin. We must sell the message of the AFM across the nation and win over even those who did not vote for us in the election."
AST_cut_british_ties:0 "Cut Ties with the Crown"
AST_cut_british_ties_desc:0 "Memories of Gallipoli still run strong in Australasia, and cries of 'never again!' are not enough. We must cut ties with the British not only in terms of our government, but also with our economy and our military alliances. Our nation must stand on its own, and from this day forth we will never again send our sires to the slaughter in a war of European Imperialism."
AST_restore_order_2:0 "The AFM Restores Order"
AST_restore_order_2_desc:0 "It has been a difficult road, but now the chaos must end. No more demonstrations, no more violence that cuts off our own nose to spite our face. The path forward lies with the AFM, and the nation must now face that fact."
AST_social_reforms:0 "New Social Reforms"
AST_social_reforms_desc:0 "The old Imperialist 'democratic' government never pushed nor strived for true equality, one where the women and minorities stand side by side with the rest of their countrymen to help build a future for us all. We will demonstrate what a truly free Australasia looks like."
AST_white_australasia:0 "End White Australasia"
AST_white_australasia_desc:0 "The White Australasia policy began with the Immigration Restriction Act of 1901 but didn't end there, and encompasses laws enacted specifically to ensure non-Europeans had a difficult time emigrating to the nation. The time has come to dismantle these laws, even if some people might not like it. Australasia needs to grow, and it must do so as a free society."
AST_monarchist_officers:0 "The Monarchist Officers"
AST_monarchist_officers_desc:0 "The military is filled with officers loyal to the monarchist regime, and the time has come to remove them from their posts. It will mean a difficult transition period, but we need a military that is committed to Australasia and Australasia alone, not one where the threat of British interference or even a coup remains dangling over the head of our leaders like the Sword of Damocles."
AST_fortress_australasia:0 "Fortress Australasia"
AST_fortress_australasia_desc:0 "Our nation must have strong borders, an unassailable island that no enemy would dare to invade. We must be a tower of strength and prove to the rest of the world that we have no need of British protection - only the seas and the determination of our fearless soldiers."
AST_state_economy:0 "Enact the State Economy"
AST_state_economy_desc:0 "Unfettered capitalism is what led to our sorry state, and thus new laws must be enacted to ensure that the Australasian economy is guided by the government and a single principle: that it work towards the betterment of us all."
AST_new_trade_office:0 "The New Trade Office"
AST_new_trade_office_desc:0 "Australasian trade practices are littered with the remnants of our colonial past: bureaucrats who are all too used to providing favouritism to the Commonwealth instead of seeking fair deals and profits. We must clear them out and forge a new trade office that puts our own nation and the good of its people ahead of an old boys' network that is a relic of the past."
AST_on_our_own:0 "On Our Own"
AST_on_our_own_desc:0 "We have no need of allies - Australasia is a nation that will stand on its own and assume a position of neutrality and strength."
AST_ties_with_japan:0 "Ties With Japan"
AST_ties_with_japan_desc:0 "If we are to look for closer ties to a power closer to home, we need look no further than the mighty nation of Japan to the north. With the White Australasia policy ended, we have demonstrated our willingness to view Asian neighbours with an equal eye... and now we must entreat them to look on us as a place where business can be done."
AST_united_we_stand:0 "United We Stand"
AST_united_we_stand_desc:0 "Let us celebrate our status as a free and just republic, no longer under the yoke of colonial masters and subject to their endless wars and cruelty. We stand united in a hostile world, boldly marching into the future with no-one to tell us otherwise."

AST_new_guard_victory:0 "Victory for the Guard"
AST_new_guard_victory_desc:0 "Australasia faces many grave dangers - foreign powers that would see us ground down, syndicalists who lie to our workers and would see our nation plunged into chaos. We will not abandon our traditions and our history for the sake of flashy revolution. Order must be maintained for the sake of all Australasians, and we will see our nation shine like never before!"
AST_paramilitary_groups:0 "Create the Secret Police"
AST_paramilitary_groups_desc:0 "The problem with the old governments is that they were unwilling to do what needed to be done in order to secure Australasia's safety - and that means watching the people carefully for any signs of syndicalist activism and revolt. Notions of freedom are quaint, but they pale in comparison to the needs of security."
AST_reaffirm_alliance:0 "Reaffirm the Entente Alliance"
AST_reaffirm_alliance_desc:0 "There are some within the Commonwealth who would look on our actions and wonder, but we must reaffirm that we are doing this for the greater good. We do not wish to fall prey to the same mistakes that led to the loss of the Home Isles, and we will show them that we wish to be a strong and effective ally in the fight to come."
AST_crush_syndicalists:0 "Crush the Syndicalists"
AST_crush_syndicalists_desc:0 "There must be no mercy shown to the syndicalists. The way they have entranced the common man, leading them into actions which only endanger us all, must come to an immediate end. We shall have strength and common purpose, and it will come through the shedding of blood."
AST_restore_order_3:0 "The Australasian Guard Restores Order"
AST_restore_order_3_desc:0 "It has been a difficult road, but now the chaos must end. No more demonstrations, no more violence that cuts off our own nose to spite our face. The path forward lies with the Australasian Guard and with tradition, and the nation must now face that fact."
AST_new_guard_officers:0 "We Need Loyal Officers"
AST_new_guard_officers_desc:0 "So many experienced officers from the Weltkrieg have been put aside, shown the door despite all the loyalty they have shown to our king and country. It is time to bring them back and show once and for all that dedication to the nation's well-being is the first and primary qualification for leading our troops."
AST_rouse_the_masses:0 "Rouse the Masses"
AST_rouse_the_masses_desc:0 "The people of Australasia are asleep, lulled into a false sense of safety by the thought that they do not have to fight, that wars in distant lands have no bearing on their future. We will dispel that notion, by force if we must. They must all stand, for the king and for country, and the world shall hear us roar!"
AST_royal_advisors:0 "The Royal Advisers"
AST_royal_advisors_desc:0 "We intend to be good allies, and to that end we should invite more advisers to see us through the tough times ahead. Let us lean on our allies as they would lean on us."
AST_a_renewed_call:0 "A Renewed Call to Arms"
AST_a_renewed_call_desc:0 "If the Home Isles are to be secured, if the tyranny of syndicalism is to be stopped in its tracks, we must awaken our sense of pride and strength and enlist for the battle to come. Remember Gallipoli, yes, but remember it as a sacrifice to honour and as a baptism in fire which has forged our nation. We will all make such sacrifices in the years to come."
AST_laissez_faire_reforms:0 "Laissez Faire Reforms"
AST_laissez_faire_reforms_desc:0 "The socialist urge to restrict and regulate has put a stranglehold on our economy. The time has come to undo those policies and see the corporations of Australasia grow as they were meant to."
AST_the_new_plan:0 "The New Plan for Australasia"
AST_the_new_plan_desc:0 "We will offer a new deal to the people of our nation: the right to have a job, the right to rise as far as they are capable, the right to work for a better future... so long as it does not come at the expense of our traditions or at the expense of our security. These are our watchwords, and they will give us comfort just as they give us prosperity."
AST_a_rising_power:0 "A Rising Power"
AST_a_rising_power_desc:0 "We are not declaring our independence from the Empire - far from it. We are, however, asserting ourselves as a regional power within that Empire. Australasia is a strong nation, and a confident member of the Entente, with interests of its own even as they serve those of the king. This is our path forward."
AST_serve_the_empire:0 "To Serve the Empire"
AST_serve_the_empire_desc:0 "We hereby affirm that Australasia's path lies with that of the king and the Commonwealth. We are, now and forever more, a loyal member of the Empire and will seek to defend it both here at home as well as elsewhere in the world. Together we will find our path to freedom and true security."
AST_the_future_is_ours:0 "The Future is Ours"
AST_the_future_is_ours_desc:0 "Let us celebrate our hard-won survival and victory, a proud member of the Commonwealth and a bastion against the predations of syndicalism and tyranny. Blood has been shed for this day, and we must honour it, and recognise that all has been fought to provide Australasia a future of which she can be proud."

AST_state_of_the_economy:0 "State of the Economy"
AST_state_of_the_economy_desc:0 "The Australasian economy has been suffering from a severe depression for the last five years. We must assess where opportunities lie and prepare our industry to be properly expanded if we're to have any hope of pulling ourselves out of this quagmire."
AST_liberalize_economy:0 "Liberalise the Economy"
AST_liberalize_economy_desc:0 "The solution to our economies woes is to liberalise our laws - allow more access for foreign investors, as well as reduce the amount of regulations which stifle our business sectors."
AST_privatization:0 "Privatise the Failing Public Sector"
AST_privatization_desc:0 "Almost all of the publicly-owned companies are doing poorly, suffering from mismanagement and even corruption. Rather than revise their practices, perhaps it's best to put them back in the hands of the private sector where they can be run by proper businessmen rather than bureaucrats."
AST_reform_government:0 "Reform the Bureaucracy"
AST_reform_government_desc:0 "The main problem facing our economy is the sheer magnitude of the governmental bureaucracy, laden down by archaic rules and focused on colonial exploitation rather than efficiency. We need a modern government which can respond to issues before they can turn into the catastrophe which faces us now, not well after."
AST_railway_network:0 "The New Railways"
AST_railway_network_desc:0 "Expansion of the railroad system throughout the east will not only give our mining sectors a shot in the arm, but also provide much-needed employment for a great number of people."
AST_urban_expansion:0 "Urban Expansion"
AST_urban_expansion_desc:0 "Australasia's cities are already growing rapidly - we must enact policies which will encourage the migration of people from the rural areas into urban ones. If our industrial base is to grow, it will need a ready source of workers ready to man the factories."
AST_new_resources_1:0 "Wealth of the Antipodes"
AST_new_resources_1_desc:0 "Australia and New Zealand both have massive, untapped resources which need only to be found and properly exploited. Ours is a dominion of mineral wealth which few other countries can hope to compare to... or, at least, it could be."
AST_new_markets:0 "Seek New Markets"
AST_new_markets_desc:0 "Rather than stick to our traditional trade partners, perhaps we should make an effort to find other countries that would make for a ready home for Australasian goods? America, Japan, Germany... really, the list is almost endless, and surely remaining solely within the Commonwealth is what has gotten us into our current mess?"
AST_trade_commonwealth:0 "Trade With the Commonwealth"
AST_trade_commonwealth_desc:0 "The Commonwealth is where our trade currently lies, and there is plenty more we could do to ensure these bonds become even stronger. We must seek out new trade agreements within the Empire, so that even as we grow stronger so will they."
AST_end_of_depression:0 "End of the Depression"
AST_end_of_depression_desc:0 "Finally we have pulled ourselves out of the doldrums of depression. Australasia can march into the future, its economy a shining example for others to follow."
AST_civ_industry_1:0 "The New Industrial Act"
AST_civ_industry_1_desc:0 "A large number of our outdated rules actually hinder industrial growth. A new law should be introduced to remove those impediments and arrange a system of incentives to companies which will erect large-scale factories in our cities."
AST_civ_industry_2:0 "Industrialise the South"
AST_civ_industry_2_desc:0 "Southern Australasia has lagged behind the more cosmopolitan regions in New South Wales, and a campaign should be initiated to promote the south to catch up."
AST_mil_industry_1:0 "Australasian Armaments"
AST_mil_industry_1_desc:0 "Up until now, most armaments have been imported from the rest of the Commonwealth. The rise of a proper armament industry will require a great deal of planning and funding, but it is absolutely necessary for the nation's future."
AST_mil_industry_2:0 "Fund the Munitions Plants"
AST_mil_industry_2_desc:0 "Our soldiers' guns and our pilots' planes won't do very much without bullets and bombs. We must start encouraging the growth of a real munitions industry in Australasia."
AST_infrastructure_1:0 "Get our Men Back at Work"
AST_infrastructure_1_desc:0 "Our nation encompasses vast swaths of open land and crossing them is the most important part of encouraging economic growth. A recent commission promises that a state-funded program to ensure every Australasian is employed in the construction of new infrastructure could last us for decades, if not more."
AST_new_resources_2:0 "Seek New Resources"
AST_new_resources_2_desc:0 "All these new roads and railroads have opened up parts of the country to prospectors and mining developers. We should encourage them with incentives."

AST_research_council:0 "The Australasian Research Council"

AST_radar_focus:0 "Focus on Radar"
AST_radar_focus_desc:0 "If Australasia faces an invasion, it will come from across the sea. Thus, we should invest heavily into new radar technologies, and build watch stations along the coast."
AST_computer_focus:0 "Focus on Computers"
AST_computer_focus_desc:0 "Computer technology is in its infancy, but already we can see the benefits it offers to encryption and decryption efforts. Australasia needs to stay ahead of this, or our enemies will end up knowing our moves long before we do."
AST_national_university:0 "A National University"
AST_national_university_desc:0 "It is important to remember that scholarly pursuits are needed to maintain our position. Generous funding increases to the National University in Canberra will allow us to educate the masses and become a beacon of new research."

AST_increased_research_2:0 "New Minds in Australasia"

AST_oil_exploration:0 "New Oil Exploration"
AST_oil_exploration_desc:0 "Australia and New Zealand have considerable oil reserves, though they are largely contained in offshore and shale deposits. Accessing those deposits, however, should be a priority for our government."
AST_uranium_mining:0 "Radium Hill Uranium"
AST_uranium_mining_desc:0 "The Radium Hill uranium mine gives us an advantage in the nuclear arms race that few other countries possess: a ready supply of the resource, to use - or not to use - as we desire."

AST_state_of_the_navy:0 "State of the RAN"
AST_state_of_the_navy_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the Royal Australian Navy was a small force that consisted of only a few small ships, and plans were to decommission even these as soon as the war ended. With the British Pacific Fleet having fled to our ports, we found ourselves in possession of a fleet that far outstrips our ability to properly manage them. This is our first and foremost issue."
AST_upgrade_facilities:0 "Upgrade Naval Facilities"
AST_upgrade_facilities_desc:0 "Our port facilities have grown, but so far we have nothing that can effectively maintain and repair our oversized fleet. Investments must be made into our naval infrastructure at once."
AST_naval_academy:0 "Establish the Naval Academy"
AST_naval_academy_desc:0 "It is not enough simply to have ships in our fleet - we must train our captains and admirals in the newest methods of naval warfare, to make each one of our vessels worth three of our enemy's."
AST_cockatoo_island_focus:0 "Rebuild Cockatoo Island"
AST_cockatoo_island_focus_desc:0 "Cockatoo Island in Sydney Harbour has been the most important shipyard in Australasia since the mid-1800's. It should be refitted and expanded to accommodate more and larger vessels."
AST_overhaul_RAN:0 "Overhaul the RAN"
AST_overhaul_RAN_desc:0 "Our efforts have paid off, and now the RAN has the skill and capacity to properly manage the Pacific Fleet without aid from the British. Australasia is now a contender for naval supremacy in the region."
AST_upgrade_reserve:0 "Upgrade the Reserves"
AST_upgrade_reserve_desc:0 "Many of the Pacific Fleet's ships were mothballed after the Weltkrieg ended, as we simply did not have the sailors to man them. While the ships are old, they are still serviceable, and with a concerted effort they could be put back into service and make our fleet even more powerful than it is."
AST_pacific_navy:0 "A Navy for the Pacific"
AST_pacific_navy_desc:0 "Our future naval efforts should focus on increasing the range of our ships and keeping them in top combat form. If they will be fighting, after all, chances are very good that they will be fighting far from home."
AST_royal_marines:0 "The Royal Marines"
AST_royal_marines_desc:0 "First and foremost in our offensive naval capabilities is our ability to land on foreign shores with the Royal Marines. This must be a fighting force like no other, supported by the most advanced transport vessels the navy can provide."
AST_light_ships:0 "Our Fleet's Foundation"
AST_light_ships_desc:0 "Our fleet of destroyers and submarines will always form the backbone of our navy, defending our trade routes just as they attack those of our enemies."
AST_heavy_ships:0 "Masters of the Sea"
AST_heavy_ships_desc:0 "Powerful battleships will make sure our naval superiority is permanent, and that we are able to project our power well beyond our borders."
AST_scrap_reserve:0 "Scrap the Reserves"
AST_scrap_reserve_desc:0 "Almost half of the larger ships in the Pacific Fleet were mothballed after the Weltkrieg ended, as we simply did not have the sailors to man them. While the ships could be brought back online, the cost of doing so is prohibitive, and thus the decision has been made to abandon them entirely and focus on what we already have in service."
AST_defensive_navy:0 "A Navy for Our Defence"
AST_defensive_navy_desc:0 "Our future naval efforts should focus on keeping our ships close to home, and instead focusing on their speed and defensive abilities. Ours is not an expeditionary force, after all, but one intended to guard our coasts and keep us safe from seaborne invasion."
AST_submarine_focus:0 "Submarine Focus"
AST_submarine_focus_desc:0 "Submarines are an excellent way to disrupt enemy convoys. We should construct as many as possible."
AST_destroyer_focus:0 "Destroyer Focus"
AST_destroyer_focus_desc:0 "Destroyers are effective at destroying enemy submarines. We should ensure our shipping is safe by constructing as many of these as possible."
AST_coastal_defense:0 "Man the Coasts"
AST_coastal_defense_desc:0 "Foremost on our minds should be the possibility that, one day, and enemy might land forces on our shores. Just because it hasn't happened yet doesn't mean it never will, and we must prepare for that day by fortifying our coastal cities as heavily as we can."
AST_shipbuilding_board:0 "The Australasian Shipbuilding Board"
AST_shipbuilding_board_desc:0 "Most shipbuilding facilities in Australasia are sorely out of date. They must be updated and expanded, ready to expand our fleet."

AST_state_of_RAAF:0 "State of the RAAF"
AST_state_of_RAAF_desc:0 "In truth, there has really been no Royal Australasian Air Force to speak of, and our current planes are barely sufficient in number to guard our own skies never mind project air superiority elsewhere. Considering that the wars of the future will be fought in the air, the government is determined that this must soon change."
AST_pilot_training:0 "New Pilot Training"
AST_pilot_training_desc:0 "The first step in rebuilding our air force is the creation of an air academy, one which can train our future airmen for the battles to come."
AST_expand_air_base:0 "Expand Archerfield"
AST_expand_air_base_desc:0 "Archerfield air base in Queensland is our largest base in the north, and the one that will be best used to project our air power over the entire northern coast. In any situation where we are fighting a potential invader, this is the base that will be most useful for own defence."
AST_air_production_1:0 "The Aviation Industry"

AST_naval_bombers:0 "Naval Bomber Focus"
AST_naval_bombers_desc:0 "Naval Bombers allow us to destroy enemy navies without risking our own ships. We should build as many of these as possible if our navy is small or busy elsewhere."
AST_air_observer_corps:0 "The Air Observer Corps"
AST_air_observer_corps_desc:0 "Our focus should not only be on taking to the skies, but on increasing our defence against those who would take to the skies against us."
AST_womens_auxiliary:0 "The Women's Auxiliary"
AST_womens_auxiliary_desc:0 "A full half of our population is better used in the war effort than sitting at home. Aircraft maintenance, the signal corps and other related tasks will be turned over to women."
AST_darwin_base:0 "Expand Northern Presence"
AST_darwin_base_desc:0 "With our cities mostly on the east and west coasts of the island, Australasia's northern frontier lacks the proper defence or preparation in case of invasion or attack. New military structures in that area will be welcome."

AST_artillery_focus:0 "Modernise the Artillery"
AST_artillery_focus_desc:0 "Australasia's artillery mostly dates from the Weltkrieg. We must modernise our artillery unless we wish our soldiers to be eviscerated without proper support."
AST_improve_equipment:0 "Relics of the Weltkrieg"
AST_improve_equipment_desc:0 "Our infantry's equipment is old, very old. Most of it saw service during the Weltkrieg, and some sets have been around even longer than that. We must equip our army with modern gear, or else we will not stand a chance in another war."
AST_clarify_anzac:0 "Clarify ANZAC"
AST_clarify_anzac_desc:0 "The Australian and New Zealand Army Corps has a long and proud history as one of the best fighting forces in the Empire. Its methods are dated, however, and we should consider carefully what its approach will be going into this new era of warfare."
AST_war_effort:0 "The War Effort"

AST_invest_in_victory:0 "Invest in Victory"
AST_invest_in_victory_desc:0 "We must work together as a nation, indeed politicians from across all ideological spectrums must pull together if we are to see victory in the days to come!"
AST_the_new_anzac:0 "The New ANZAC"
AST_the_new_anzac_desc:0 "Our army is the core of our defence, and emergency measures must be passed to ensure they have access to the best equipment and the best personnel that we can possibly provide. When our enemies see the ANZAC symbol, they should know they face among the very best soldiers the world has to offer."
AST_mobile_focus:0 "Focus on Mobility"
AST_mobile_focus_desc:0 "The quality of our forces do not matter half so much as their mobility. This is a new era, and tactics of encirclement and reach are far more vital to victory than ever before. This must be the focus on Australasia's military future."
AST_tank_penetration:0 "The Sentinel Project"
AST_tank_penetration_desc:0 "Mobility does not mean simply building tanks - there is also the question of mobilising our infantry units, by building mechanised transport which will get them to the front quickly."
AST_equipment_focus:0 "Focus on Quality"
AST_equipment_focus_desc:0 "We do not have the industrial capacity for a large or armoured force. Instead we must focus on keeping Australasia's army small yet well-equipped and well-trained. Size is not as important as quality!"
AST_catering_corps:0 "The Australasian Catering Corps"
AST_catering_corps_desc:0 "Ours is a treacherous land, and it is our military engineers, medics and maintenance companies that often keep entire units alive and on the move. However, as our army expands, so too must our support companies. They are the backbone of our operations, after all."
AST_officer_school:0 "New Officer Training"
AST_officer_school_desc:0 "The training of our officer corps needs updating - the methods of warfare are progressing faster than anyone could possibly hope to keep pace, and yet we must try."
AST_small_unit_tactics:0 "Small Unit Tactics"

AST_mountaineers_focus:0 "Bring on the Mountaineers"

AST_jungle_training:0 "Focus on Jungle Combat"
AST_jungle_training_desc:0 "The southern Pacific and Southeast Asia are full of jungles and little more. If this is a field we expect to fight on, then we must prepare our units to fight in them. Special bases should be constructed to that effect in the northern reaches of Queensland, where our jungles are at their most dense."
AST_defense_focus:0 "Focus on Defence"
AST_defense_focus_desc:0 "Any attempt to project our military power beyond our borders is doomed to bring little more than grief. Our focus, as a nation, should be on our own defence."

AST_increase_reserves:0 "Increase the Reserves"
AST_increase_reserves_desc:0 "Conscription laws have been enacted, but they are insufficient. In the name of our defence, we must see to it that everyone takes part in defending king and country."
AST_anderson_doctrine:0 "Enact the Anderson Doctrine"
AST_anderson_doctrine_desc:0 "Former Admiral David Murray Anderson has long called for a renewed commitment to completing what he was unable to in 1925: the reclamation and protection of the British territories in Asia and the Pacific. While dangerously revanchist, this 'Anderson Doctrine' is fast gaining in popularity."

### Decisions ###
AST_anderson_policy_decisions:0 "Anderson Doctrine"
AST_anderson_policy_decisions_desc:0 "The Anderson Doctrine sets out that the former colonies belonging to the United Kingdom, lost after their collapse at the end for the Weltkrieg, are rightfully [Root.GetAdjective] domain. In the name of our national security, it is vital that we get these colonies back and expand our dominion over the islands of Southeast Asia and the Pacific."
AST_exploit_resources:0 "Exploit Resources"
AST_claim_new_guinea:0 "Claim New Guinea"
AST_claim_new_guinea_desc:0 "Port Moresby and the surrounding territory in New Guinea is a vital outpost for our nation, and our security will always be threatened so long as the northern portion of New Guinea as well as the island chain directly to its east are under the control of enemy nations."
AST_claim_melanesia:0 "Claim Melanesian Islands"
AST_claim_melanesia_desc:0 "The islands of Melanesia - including New Caledonia, New Hebrides, the Solomon Islands, and Nauru - were only lost to France and the United Kingdom following their defeat at the end of the Weltkrieg. Under the Anderson Doctrine, they are properly part of our eminent domain, and belong under our protection."
AST_claim_south_pacific:0 "Claim the Southern Pacific"
AST_claim_south_pacific_desc:0 "There are a number of islands chains in the southern Pacific Ocean - including the Gilbert and Ellis Islands, Samoa, Polynesia, and Pitcairn Island - that were once British possessions, but which were seized by Germany after the British collapse following the Weltkrieg. Under the Anderson Doctrine, they are properly part of our eminent domain, and belong under our protection."
AST_claim_caroline_islands:0 "Claim the German East Indies"
AST_claim_caroline_islands_desc:0 "The various island atolls that lie to the north of New Guinea - among them the Marshall Islands, the Caroline Islands, Palau, and the Marianas - were sold by Spain to Germany following the end of the Spanish-American War at the turn of the century. Their presence off our northern coasts is a threat to our national security, and the islands properly belong under our protection."
AST_claim_singapore:0 "Claim Singapore"
AST_claim_singapore_desc:0 "Singapore was once the colonial bastion of the United Kingdom in Southeast Asia, the last holdout in the Weltkrieg before Admiral Anderson himself was forced to abandon it for Australasia. Gaining it back is the central tenet of the Anderson Doctrine, and vital to building our national security."
AST_claim_sarawak:0 "Claim Sarawak"
AST_claim_sarawak_desc:0 "The region of northern Borneo was once known as Sarawak, a British holding under the White Rajah himself. With the White Rajah and his family having fled to Australasia, there is considerable internal pressure on the government to extend the Anderson Doctrine to this region and bring it back under our domain as a protectorate."
AST_claim_malaya:0 "Claim Malaya"
AST_claim_malaya_desc:0 "The Malaysian peninsula is not only a region that contains vital resources, it is also a former British territory taken by the Germans following the Weltkrieg. While gaining it might be extending our reach further north than is wise, it falls within the jurisdiction of the Anderson Doctrine that former British territories in Southeast Asia are part of our eminent domain, and thus we should seek its return."
AST_claim_western_new_guinea:0 "Claim Western New Guinea"
AST_claim_western_new_guinea_desc:0 "While the western part of New Guinea is not covered under the Anderson Doctrine, having never been held by the British, it is nevertheless vital to our national security, as the islands lie immediately off our borders and we cannot tolerate it remaining within possibly enemy hands."
AST_claim_timor:0 "Claim Timor"

AST_conscription_plebiscite:0 "Begin the Conscription Plebiscite"
AST_conscription_plebiscite_desc:0 "The enactment of conscription laws will be an unpopular move, one that will be accompanied by cries of 'Remember Gallipoli!' throughout the country. Yet we have dire need to expand our army's enrolment. The best way to move forward would be to hold a national plebiscite on the issue. If it passes, we will have the mandate we need without fear of mass reprisal."
AST_skip_plebiscite:0 "Force Conscription"
AST_skip_plebiscite_desc:0 "There is no time to hold a plebiscite on conscription, as has been suggested in the past. It must be enacted, whether the people like it or not, and our government will simply have to bear the consequences."

### Events ###

austral.1.t:0 "Status of the Confederation"
austral.1.d:0 "Formed in 1924 as a result of the Consolidation Of Resources Act, the Australasian Confederation is the combination of the British Australasian Dominions, Australia and New Zealand, as well as the territories of British New Guinea and Fiji. The years since the Weltkrieg have brought great change and hardship. The war strained both society and the economy, which in Australia manifested itself in the short-lived Melbourne Commune. Although disowned by the then-ruling Labor government and put down by demobilised Australian Imperial Force veterans, this resulted in the implementation of the Emergency Protocols, the suspension of elections, and the appointment of William Birdwood as Governor General. Then the British Revolution of 1925 shook the Empire to the core and Australasia was unable to prevent the loss of territories to the Germans. More than 10 years on, the situation is still unstable as the economy remains stagnant and domestic dissent continues to grow with Birdwood, alongside his ally Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party, barely holding things together."
austral.1.a:0 "Advance Australasia! Onwards!"
austral.2.t:0 "The Oncoming Election"
austral.2.d:0 "Elections in the Antipodes were suspended by the Emergency Protocols, enacted in 1923, which also led to the dissolving of the autonomy of the separate New Zealand Parliament. However, elections are now set for March this year after Stanley Bruce successfully campaigned for their reintroduction. Governor-General Birdwood was forced to make this concession when Bruce defeated Hughes for the leadership of the Nationalist Party. Bruce's decision not to act as unelected Prime Minister resulted in the expulsion of his faction from the Nationalist Party and Hughes' recall as PM, however the public would not accept the government reneging on its commitments. Australasia can ill afford a repeat of 1923 - as the spectre of Melbourne remains fresh in the minds of many."
austral.2.a:0 "We have to give way to change."
austral.3.t:0 "The Passing of King George V"
austral.3.d:0 "The ousted king of Britain, George V, has finally succumbed to the illness that had plagued him since revolution swept through the home isles. His son, Edward, has ascended the throne of the British Empire, including that of the Australasian dominions. While many in Australasia mourn, there are others for whom the king's death has resurrected memories of the Weltkrieg and the disaster of Gallipoli in particular, and they have taken to the streets to demand a separation of the nation from the British crown as well as the Entente alliance."
austral.3.a:0 "Can they not even respect a state of mourning?"
austral.4.t:0 "A Special Conference of the Labor Party"
austral.4.d:0 "Today the Australasian Labor Party convened a special session in Sydney where the former premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, was readmitted into the party after having been excluded for 5 years. Lang originally left the party and formed his own due to disagreements with the leadership. After his dismissal from government by the contemporary governor of NSW, Philip Game he fell out of popularity and sought to re-join the party. A powerful orator and a populist through and through, the re-admittance of Lang has caused consternation amongst the more leftist members of the Labor Party who, alongside the majority of trade union activists, see him more as a social feudalist inherently hostile to true socialist doctrine. It seems that the Australasian Labor Party is heading into a turbulent time, given the imminent election."
austral.4.a:0 "Let the leftists squabble amongst themselves!"
austral.5.t:0 "The Australasian Guard"
austral.5.d:0 "Originally formed in 1925, the Australasian Guard is a staunchly nationalist and jingoistic movement, which traces its roots back to the paramilitary organisation the 'League of National Security'. Comprised of former servicemen returning from the Weltkrieg with the backing of influential Australasians, many of these men helped put down the 1923 Melbourne Commune. In the years following the Melbourne Uprising, the Guard has continued to support the government, with many supporters joining the expanded security forces available to the Governor-General and assisting in suppressing left-wing activities. The coming return to democratic rule has caused an upset amongst the far right, however, who fear the re-emergence of the long-suppressed Labor movement and that the Nationalist Party, divided as it is, will be unable to maintain the status quo. Due to these factors, the Guard's leader, Eric Campbell, has decided that it will take part in the elections as the Centre Party. Despite their not-inconsiderable levels of popular support, at present it is unsure what impact they will have."
austral.5.a:0 "This can't be good..."
austral.6.t:0 "Victorian Bush Fires"
austral.6.d:0 "The state of Victoria has been hit by heavy bush fires in the north east and south west. Because of intense heat and drought over the last few years, much of rural Victoria has dried up - leaving plenty of fuel for the flames. The fires at this point are so incredibly intense that the ash and smoke can be seen from New Zealand. Firefighters with the aid of the state government are currently trying to combat the disaster, with the flames already threatening several major cities and causing considerable panic."
austral.6.a:0 "Goodness!"
austral.7.t:0 "Bush Fires Finally Extinguished"
austral.7.d:0 "The fires in Victoria have finally been extinguished, thanks to the efforts of local fire fighters as well as overdue dense rainfall. This victory has come at the cost of 71 lives, over 1000 homes destroyed, and the burning of almost 135,500 hectares of land. Currently Judge Leonard Stretton has been selected to lead a royal commission into what led to the disastrous fires, though many suspect farmers or graziers in rural areas to be responsible due to their long-standing practice of burning brush to clear new land."
austral.7.a:0 "Well, at least the worst is over."
austral.8.t:0 "Ion Idriess' 'The Cattle King'"
austral.8.d:0 "Leading Australian writer Ion Idriess today published his latest novel, 'The Cattle King'. It follows the life of recently-deceased Sir Sidney Kidman, an entrepreneur and pastoralist who owned or co-owned large areas of land in Australia in his lifetime. Kidman became widely popular due to his support of the government in the Weltkrieg and charitable organisations. The book looks set to be Australasia's best-seller for 1936, and many are drawing parallels between Kidman and the exiled White Rajah, Charles Vyner Brooke, which is sure to boost Brooke's popularity."
austral.8.a:0 "An Interesting Read!"
austral.9.t:0 "Australasia Day"
austral.9.d:0 "Today the nation is celebrating the Confederation of Australasia and, while the confederation was not voluntary - having been initially formed by the British invocation of the Conservation of Resources Act in 1924 - it still has brought many benefits to both Australia and New Zealand, or such is the common belief. Crowds are lining the city streets from one side of the country to the other in order to celebrate the occasion."
austral.9.a:0 "Advance Australasia Fair!"
austral.10.t:0 "The [GetYear] Federal Election"
austral.10.d:0 "The first free elections in over a decade, which many are calling 'Bruce's Election', look set to return a majority for the United Australasia Party. However, the Labor and Country parties are campaigning vigorously, while the Nationalists struggle to retain their core vote with the left voting UAP and the right declaring for the Guard's Centre Party. Many are, at least, grateful that Campbell's Centre party seemingly has no chance of actually winning, though it seems likely they will make a good showing."

austral.10.c:0 "Stanley Bruce and the United Australasia Party."
austral.11.t:0 "The Australasian Guard and the Election"
austral.11.d:0 "The Australasian Guard has emerged from the election far stronger than when it went in. Eric Campbell's Centre Party, while failing to take many Parliamentary seats, did manage to secure a large percentage of the popular vote, mostly at the expense of the Nationalists. Despite this, the lack of a coherent strategy as well as a hostile media reception were clear hindrances for them."
austral.11.a:0 "Oh dear!"
austral.12.t:0 "A New Governor-General?"
austral.12.d:0 "William Birdwood's tenure as Governor-General saw a vast expansion in powers available to the position, which he used to maintain order in Oceania at the expense of democracy and civil liberties. Birdwood, a British General from the Weltkrieg, was imposed upon Australasia by an Empire fearful of revolt... but times have changed, and the newly-elected government could use this opportunity to replace him with a native Australasian. While this move would be popular with many, others have suggested that an opportunity exists to invite a member of the royal family to assume the role and thus put Australasia more firmly within the sphere of the Empire and our fellow Entente allies. Another suggestion for Governor-General is former White Rajah Charles Vyneer Brooke, who has been a famed socialiser in Sydney and has gotten the support of several far-right groups such as the Centre Party and New Guard Movements."
austral.12.a:0 "William Birdwood should remain where he is."
austral.12.b:0 "It is time for an Australasian Governor-General!"
austral.12.c:0 "We should invite a member of the royal family to hold the post."
austral.12.meme:0 "The White Rajah will bring us Stability and International Fame!"
austral.13.t:0 "The ACTU Makes its Move"
austral.13.d:0 "The Australasian Labor Party National Executive met today in Canberra, after being swept into office in an unexpected result. John Curtin now has to decide which direction to take the party and the nation, however. There is a schism already opening between the different wings of the party. Jack Lang and the moderate right wing of the party are up against the revolutionary left, consolidated around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. The ACTU wants to seize this opportunity to enact real syndicalist policies throughout Australasia, form a republic in memory of the Melbourne Commune, and break from the imperialist Entente. Lang wishes to expel these radicals from the party, maintaining our place in the Empire. Curtin must make a choice: break his party or lead a revolution."
austral.13.a:0 "Expel the revolutionaries from the party!"
austral.13.b:0 "The ACTU seizes control! Declare the syndicalist republic!"
austral.14.t:0 "New Labor Campaigning"
austral.14.d:0 "There have been a recent upswing in the Labor party's campaign efforts, as they appear to have a great deal more money in the party coffers than previously thought possible. [Root.GetAdjective] police investigators suggest that the money is likely being funnelled through the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, sent by the Union of Britain, as an effort to support radicals within the Labor party... though there is no real evidence of that yet."
austral.14.a:0 "Foreign interference in our elections? Outrageous!"
austral.20.t:0 "Workers' Organisation and Trade Unions"
austral.20.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Melbourne Commune and the Revolution of 1925, trade unions were made illegal. While many continued to operate underground alongside the Australasian Labor Party, they were suppressed by the expanded police and military districts as well as by the Australasian Guard. While we may be sceptical of their ideology, the continued draconian enforcement of Birdwood's policies will undoubtedly be an unpopular move, so we must consider whether to legalise these unions and seek a compromise with their leaders."
austral.20.a:0 "Rescind Birdwood's policies."
austral.20.b:0 "Trade unions cause trouble - continue the suppression."
austral.21.t:0 "The Syndicalist March"
austral.21.d.notlabor:0 "Responding to the election results, which the Labor party claims were rigged against their candidates, radicals supported by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions held an illegal march in several of Australasia's cities today. They are protesting the continued suppression of unions, and several of the marches ended in clashes with both the police and local paramilitary groups. All the marches were successfully dispersed, but leaders have sworn that they will continue to resist the new government, and that without freedom the Australasian Confederation cannot truly call itself a democracy."
austral.21.d.labor:0 "Responding to their recent ejection from the Labor party's ranks and the new government, radicals supported by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions held an illegal march in several of Australasia's cities today. They are demanding a swift end to union suppression, something Labor party leaders have already promised, and several of the marches ended in clashes with both the police and local paramilitary groups. All the marches were successfully dispersed, but leaders have sworn that they will continue to resist the new government, and that without freedom the Australasian Confederation cannot truly call itself a democracy."
austral.21.a:0 "They are asking for trouble."
austral.22.t:0 "The ACTU Campaign"
austral.22.d:0 "Responding to the government's decision to legalise trade unions, the newly-legitimised ACTU has begun a major push for the next general election. Large crowds have been gathering to hear syndicalist leader Fred Paterson speak, and while pundits don't give the radicals much hope in winning there is a sense of worry regarding Paterson's growing support. Some ministers have expressed reservation of the legalisation, calling it a 'dangerous experiment', but for the moment the damage appears to be minimal."
austral.22.a:0 "We will keep a close eye on this."
austral.23.t:0 "Unions Protest Suppression"
austral.23.d:0 "Union supporters have taken to the streets in several major Australasian cities, protesting the government's decision to continue the suppression of the ACTU and its syndicalist allies. The protesters were met with police, and later with Australasian Guard paramilitary groups, and this led to bloody clashes in Melbourne where dozens were reported injured. Maximist leader J.B. Miles has called for continued resistance to the government's anti-union policies, although he drew short of openly calling for armed revolt."
austral.24.t:0 "Miners Clash with Police"
austral.24.d:0 "The continued suppression of trade unions drew a strong reaction today as miners across Victoria state attempted a walk-out, protesting unsafe conditions which have only become worse over the last decade. While they claimed to have no association with a union, their action was declared unlawful, and several clashes with police ended with the death of a miner by the name of Joseph Grenton. While the walk-out was disbanded, 'Miner Joe' has been elevated to something of a folk hero among the Australasian working class."
austral.24.a:0 "A dead folk hero, that is."
austral.25.t:0 "ACTU Celebrates Deal"
austral.25.d:0 "The new Workers' Deal enacted by the government has been a great cause for celebration among Australasia's working class - and the Australasian Council of Trade Unions specifically has led marches across several large cities to commemorate the historic occasion. Speeches by ACTU leaders drew massive crowds, where they spoke with obvious fervour about syndicalist ideals and the true interests of the working class. Police stood nearby, keeping back agitators who hurled slurs at the socialists, and there were no reports of incidents."
austral.25.a:0 "At least there was no violence."
austral.26.t:0 "Illegal Strike in Sydney"
austral.26.d:0 "Factory workers in Sydney walked off the job today, organising an illegal strike that prompted swift police reaction. While the workers insisted they were not associated with the ACTU and their action was borne of frustration, they were issued an ultimatum to disperse - which they ignored. Violence quickly escalated when the police moved in, and the resulting riot ended with over thirty badly injured. Within a week, the factory workers were back on the job... now supervised by private militia soldiers, to ensure no further demonstrations."
austral.26.a:0 "This is rather getting out of hand..."
austral.27.t:0 "Lang Speech Disrupted"
austral.27.d:0 "Jack Lang gave a fiery speech today in Sydney, in which he railed against the syndicalists and radicals which have plagued the labour movement. He did not get far into his speech, however, when it was disrupted by syndicalist supporters chanting 'Traitor' and 'Sell-out'. Lang at first ignored such taunts but eventually joined in, with every counter-insult he made being followed by cheers and roars from his supporters. When discussing employment Lang had decided to eject the Syndicalists after one remarked 'Didn't you and Beasley turn Australasian workers out of their jobs when you scabbed the party?'. Following this, a violent confrontation broke out between the Syndicalist and Labor supporters. The incident was picked up by the Australasian media, and while their intent was to blame the radicals for their disruption, instead it is Lang who is seen by the public as the one who escalated the confrontation and edged on his supporters."
austral.27.a:0 "Perhaps 'I will punch your bloody teeth in' was too much."
austral.28.t:0 "Paterson Gives Speech"
austral.28.d:0 "With the lifting of martial law across Australasia, crowds are once again able to assemble - a fact that syndicalist leader Fred Paterson took advantage of today in Sydney to give a speech that drew a very large crowd as well as media attention. Paterson spoke of the need for an 'open dialogue' between the unions and the government, and that there was no need to fear the brand of democracy that syndicalism brought. The speech was branded by some as the 'ramblings of a radical', though many others said that Paterson's well-spoken manner earned him many new supporters."

austral.29.t:0 "Factory Burns in [factory_state.GetName]"
austral.29.d:0 "One of the largest factories in [factory_state.GetName] burned through the night in what is believed to be arson. The factory has reportedly had numerous complaints about working conditions and unfair pay, most of which have gone unaddressed over the last five years. The owners deny this and claimed this was yet another attempt by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to stir up trouble and support for the syndicalist cause. While damage was severe, the ACTU has no claimed any responsibility for the fire and police are still investigating."
austral.29.a:0 "Sabotage, now?"
austral.30.t:0 "General Strike"
austral.30.d.legal:0 "The labour situation worsened in Australasia today as the ACTU called for general strikes around the country to protest the poor working conditions present in many factories. Some are calling this a ploy for support, and the move has already prompted many leaders within the Australasian Guard and elsewhere to call for the government to reverse its decision to allow labour unions, but either way the strikes are expected to go on for several weeks until some kind of compromise can be achieved."

austral.31.t:0 "Rise of the Australasian Guard"
austral.31.d:0 "In response to the general labour unrest which has been plaguing Australasia since the last election, Eric Campbell today made an impassioned speech calling for 'united, determined and firm action on the part of the loyal citizens of Australasia'. He says the government has failed in its mandate, and that unless severe measures are taken all of Australasia will succumb to chaos and the tide of syndicalism which is washing across the world. His words caught the attention of many, and already support in rural parts as well as the urban areas of the country has been shifting to his Centre Party."
austral.31.a:0 "That's all we need."
austral.32.t:0 "Rise of the AFM"
austral.32.d:0 "Up until this point, the Australasia First Movement - led by Percy Stephensen - has been considered a fringe movement filled with disaffected socialists. With the rise of chaos inspired by syndicalist forces, and with it the fortunes of the Australasian Guard, Stephensen's words have gained new purchase among the people of Australasia. Stephensen calls for Australasia to cut its ties with the British crown, to further promote Australasianism and to maintain a neutral stance in global affairs so to ensure Australasia never marches into another disaster like Gallipoli. 'They talk grandiloquently about 'filling up Australia's vast empty spaces' and then they dump down the scum of London here,' he tells his ardent supporters, 'To hell with the British and the Empire!'"
austral.32.a:0 "That's treasonous talk, is what that is."
austral.33.t:0 "AFM Protests the War"
austral.33.d:0 "The Australasia First Movement, a group that advocates neutrality and a cutting of ties with the British crown, has set up a number of protests across the country to call for Australasia's abandonment of the current war. Cries of 'Never Gallipoli!' were heard from the marchers, who suggest the British have dragged the country into war after war, and that it is time for it all to stop. The group's message has carried to the Australasian people quite well, and those still disaffected by the lingering wounds of the Weltkrieg are clearly listening."
austral.33.a:0 "They're a fringe group, nothing more."
austral.34.t:0 "Charles Vyner Brooke Backs the Guard"
austral.34.d:0 "The exiled 'White Rajah' of Sarawak and noted Sydney socialite, Charles Vyner Brooke, has now openly begun to associate with the reactionary group known as 'the Australasian Guard' led by Weltkrieg veteran Eric Campbell. Until now, the Guard has been a minor force in Australasian politics, but with their forceful revanchist rhetoric and populist flair the movement has begun to spread its influence beyond New South Wales, especially gaining support amongst discharged servicemen and disgruntled officers. With Brooke's charm and considerable monetary resources, the Guard might just have gained the staging point for a showdown with the new regime in Canberra. The government should be prepared for any eventuality."

austral.35.t:0 "The Great Schism of the Australasian Labor Party"
austral.35.d.notlabor:0 "Since Jack Lang's re-admittance to its ranks, the Labor Party has been steaming with internal disputes. Today, Lang struck back at the leftist members of the New South Wales party branch, successfully having them excluded alongside their syndicalist-friendly trade union comrades from the ACTU. This purge of the NSW party has since rippled throughout the Confederation with Lang's supporters of moderate social populists and anti-syndicalist union supporters ostracizing and marginalising their more leftist opponents. This 'Great Schism' of the Australasian Labor Party has firmly separated the Oceanic worker's movement into a reformist and populist rump Labor Party and a revolutionary movement consolidating around the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. Yet all is not well in Labor, since friction still exists between Lang and the popular John J. Curtin."

austral.64.t:0 "The Crown Severs Ties"
austral.64.d:0 "While the crown has given its assent to repatriate the [Root.GetAdjective] constitution, they have also ejected us from the British alliance, stating that any colony so willing to abandon the empire cannot expect its protection nor be expected to come to its aid. Some [Root.GetAdjective] politicians felt this response to be almost childish, but the matter is done - never again will we be subject to British control as we were following the invocation of the Emergency Protocols in 1925. We are now and forever more our own nation!"
austral.65.t:0 "The Crown Refuses"
austral.65.d:0 "In what has become a shock to many within the [Root.GetAdjective] government, our delegates have returned with word that the British crown has refused our independence. [Root.GetNameDef] plays too vital a role within the Entente, they were told, and is too integral a part of the British Empire. Considering that, until recently, [Root.GetNameDef] was under the crown's direct rule, the attitude is perhaps not unexpected. The option still remains to declare the republic anyhow, though doing so could elicit a reaction from [From.GetNameDef] to retake a 'rebellious colony'."

austral.66.d:0 "Despite our warning, the [From.GetAdjective] government has defied the king's prohibition and declared itself a republic, cutting all ties to the British monarchy as well as to the Entente alliance. The king is reportedly furious at this [From.GetAdjective] treason, but there are many within the government who ask what can be done... do we really wish to wage war to retake a former colony halfway across the world?"
austral.66.a:0 "Good riddance to colonial rubbish."
austral.66.b:0 "Evidently they need to be taught a lesson."
austral.67.t:0 "A New Republic"
austral.67.d:0 "Since [Root.GetNameDef] is no longer part of the Entente or the British Empire, the separation of our government from that of the British Crown is but a formality - today it was announced, with the Governor-General taking part in what will be his last duties within the [Root.GetAdjective] parliament. After this point, his role will be purely ceremonial, and the [Root.GetAdjective] head of state will also be its head of government. We are, now and forever more, a truly independent republic!"
austral.68.t:0 "A New Governor General"
austral.68.d:0 "As part of our nation's drawing closer to the royal crown, a new Governor General has been appointed for us - Prince Henry, the Duke of Gloucester, brother to the king and an accomplished man in his own right. The appointment is considered a great honour, and cheering crowds have lined the streets to receive him as he arrives at Parliament House to assume his first duties."
austral.68.a:0 "Hurrah!"
austral.80.t:0 "Massive Demonstrations"
austral.80.d:0 "In response to the Australasian Guard's assumption of control, control which has come with the suspension of democratic rule, demonstrations have broken out across [Root.GetNameDef]. The government suspects that much of this is orchestrated by syndicalist activists in the Australasian Trade Council Union, but that cannot currently be proven... and, truth be told, support for the syndicalist rhetoric is increasing rapidly. Advisers have informed the government that this agitation is likely to get worse before it gets better."
austral.80.a:0 "We shall see about that!"
austral.81.t:0 "Unions Call for Illegal Strikes"
austral.81.d:0 "Despite the suspension of all official [Root.GetAdjective] trade unions in the country, union leaders have called for general strikes - calls which are being responded to in all major cities. For the past three days, the streets have been flooded with throngs of angry crowds carrying signs decrying the Guard's administration. Police and paramilitary groups have managed to suppress the worst of it, but resistance is expected to continue for at least the next month."
austral.81.a:0 "This cannot be allowed to continue."
austral.82.t:0 "Bloody Clash with Miners"
austral.82.d:0 "With the national strikes only recently passed, it was thought that labour unrest was at an end... until a large miner's strike erupted in the southern state of Victoria. Several paramilitary groups, ardent supporters of the Australasian Guard government, descended on the strikers and violently ended it in a clash that left over 25 dead and 60 wounded. While further strikes appear to be unlikely, the government is largely seen as responsible for the bloodshed and it appears to only be a matter of time before activists take up their calls once again."
austral.82.a:0 "This is getting out of hand!"
austral.83.t:0 "Syndicalist Cells Uncovered"
austral.83.d:0 "Finally some good news today as three separate cells of syndicalist agitators were uncovered in major [Root.GetAdjective] cities. Over fifty arrests were made, with public trials expected within weeks, a true blow to the syndicalist movement. There are some, however, who have expressed dismay at how quickly the syndicalists have organised, and suggest that these cells may simply be a few of many in [Root.GetNameDef]."
austral.83.a:0 "Well, it's certainly a start."
austral.84.t:0 "Renewed Protests"
austral.84.d:0 "After a period of quiet, protests have erupted across [Root.GetNameDef] this week - massive marches of thousands, with the crowd in Sydney alone estimated to reach upwards of a hundred thousand people. This is far too much for the [Root.GetAdjective] to disperse without sparking a civil war, and thus so far, they have primarily sought to contain things. These are the first protests where syndicalist leader John Curtin has spoken openly, demanding the Australasian Guard government resign in disgrace, and though police have attempted to quietly arrest Curtin so far the crowds have protected him."
austral.84.a:0 "He's *popular* now, is he?"
austral.85.t:0 "The Second Melbourne Uprising"
austral.85.d:0 "For the second time since the first uprising in 1924, syndicalist supporters have initiated a mass uprising in Melbourne - one that's supported by massive crowds of protestors, calling for the immediate resignation of the Australasian Guard government. The army has squared off against their barricades in the city centre, but the entire nation - indeed, the world - is watching. Either we march in and put down the uprising, triggering massive bloodshed on our fellow Australasians, or we admit defeat and resign."

They are asking that the Governor General enact the Emergency Protocols, assuming full control of [From.GetNameDef] as before. The cost will be significant and threatens to embroil us further in their political mess, one which many say can be lain at the feat of the extremist [From.GetAdjective] government. Still, if the alternative is a surrender to syndicalists..."
austral.86.a:0 "If it will prevent further chaos, then so be it."
austral.86.b:0 "Australasia must sort out its own problems."
austral.87.t:0 "Emergency Protocols Invoked"
austral.87.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has agreed to rush to our aid, sending both supplies and troops to Melbourne - and they have invoked the Emergency Protocols for the second time since 1925. As before, the Governor General has assumed full command of the nation, forming a temporary government under a chosen prime minister. This intervention does signal at least a return to the previous status quo, and it appears the resignation of the Australasian Guard government has been enough to take the wind out of the uprising. Once again the syndicalists have disappeared into the woodwork and the crisis is passed."
austral.87.a:0 "Whew!"
austral.88.t:0 "The Governor General Refuses"
austral.88.d:0 "As the crisis in Melbourne deepens, the Governor General has indicated a refusal by the [From.GetAdjective] government to either send aid or permit the enactment of the Emergency Protocols. Our mess, they suggest, is one of our own making. It appears we are on our own."

Labor leaders have mostly surrendered to police, and [Root.GetAdjective] newspapers have pronounced victory for ordinary citizens. The country, they say, is now safe from radicals."

A new faction of socialists has arisen under the oratorship of John 'Jock' Garden, but most deem it unlikely that he has any hope of becoming the next chairman - short of a catastrophic splitting of the votes between the syndicalists and Maximists."

austral.111.d:0 "While the ACTU prepares for its first congress, one that will determine the future direction of a syndicalist Australasia, there is much positioning behind the scenes for the election of a temporary chairman. The holder of that role will, in effect, have control over the government's day-to-day running... more so, in fact, than the Prime Minister. The moderate syndicalists support the well know Fred Paterson for the position, though J.B. Miles has been gaining a great deal of steam with his calculated speeches and rhetoric."

austral.112.d:0 "The successful election of John Miles's Maximists in the ACTU has left the question of who his vice-chairman will be, responsible for running the day-to-day affairs of the government. Currently there are two long standing comrades that are worth of such a position. The first is Lance Sharkey, who has had a long-standing relationship with Miles and is unshakeable in his orthodox beliefs. The other is the previous leader of the party, Herbert Moxon, who has many years of experience behind him and is one of the syndicalists responsible for the infiltration of the Australasian Labor Party which enabled the revolution. Both are worthy, but only one can be chosen."
austral.112.a:0 "Lance Sharkey will make a fine vice-chairman."

austral.113.d:0 "Following the success of the syndicalists in the recent congress, Fred Paterson has now the honour of choosing the first vice-chairman of Australasia to run the government's day-to-day operations. Jack Henry is quite familiar with Paterson, as both were notorious for organising illegal strikes and further expanding syndicalist membership during the early 30's in Queensland, which took on the nickname of 'the Red North'. The other viable contender is well-known philosopher John Anderson, who seeks to reform the education system and provide higher institutes of learning for his fellow comrades."

austral.137.d:0 "With the AFM currently having wrested control over parliament, effectively turning the country into a dictatorship, there is a great deal of strife within the party over whether this is truly the right thing to do. Many have begun to question Percy Stephensen's leadership, and advisers have suggested that he might consider appointing a deputy who would exert more effective sway over the running of the government. The aboriginal civil rights activist Jack Patten would be an obvious and effective choice, though many have expressed a preference for the suffragette Adela Pankhurst - both because she is influential as well as because she is seen as more politically acceptable."

So far, over a hundred Guard supporters have been rounded up throughout [Root.GetNameDef], including members of the Centre Party and their leader, Eric Campbell.

austral.243.d.forced:0 "Nowhere has the issue of conscription been more sensitive than in New Zealand, a territory that already felt it was joined to [Root.GetNameDef] unwillingly by the Consolidation Of Resources Act in 1924. Now that conscription has been forced on the nation by the [Root.GetAdjective] government, riots have broken out across the state - with many rioters angrily burning [Root.GetAdjective] flags and vowing that New Zealand should not be part of the confederation at all."
austral.243.d.voted:0 "As the votes were being counted it soon became clear that the Yay-side would carry the day. However, complications have arisen since New Zealand overwhelmingly voted no to confederate conscription while mainland Australians mainly voted yes. As a territory which already feels it was forced into confederation by the Consolidation Of Resources Act in 1924, feelings are running raw and several riots have broken out in Auckland and elsewhere, demanding a referendum be held in the state to determine its future as part of Australasia."

austral.246.d:0 "Charles Vyner Brooke, one of the leading figures in the Australasian Guard and its political front the Centre Party, has today attacked the government over its failure to adopt conscription.

austral.247.t:0 "Nationalists Support the Centre Party"
austral.247.d:0 "Support for Billy Hughes' Nationalist Party has waned significantly since the 1936 election. As more and more of their supporters and members have left to join either Stanley Bruce's UAP or the emerging force of Eric Campbell and his Centre Party, Hughes has ultimately decided to throw his lot in with the Australasian Guard. No longer splitting the far-right vote, the Guard is now a serious contender in the next federal election."

austral.248.t:0 "The Loss of New Zealand"

austral.250.d.gbr:0 "With the British home islands having been restored and the crisis considered over, the state government of New Zealand is being pressured by its people to consider a referendum on independence from [Root.GetNameDef].

austral.253.t:0 "New Zealand Votes to Leave"
austral.253.d:0 "After a month of voting across the state, with turnout very high, New Zealand has voted to leave [Root.GetNameDef]. The vote in favour of the motion was exceedingly high, enough so that few are attempting to claim that the island does not have a democratic imperative to secede. Indeed, the state is already taking measures to sever governmental ties with the mainland."
austral.253.a:0 "So be it!"
austral.254.t:0 "Day of Mourning"
austral.254.d:0 "Today marks the 150th anniversary of the first fleet landing in Australia. While many mainland Australians are celebrating the day, the native aborigines are mourning the loss of their land and the suffering of their people. In response, and with the assistance of the Australasia First Movement, the Aborigines Progressive Association has held a protest for equal rights, full citizenship, and better education for all Australian aboriginal peoples. Jack Patten, the leader of the organisation and a notable member of AFM, stated 'Give us the chance! We do not wish to be left behind in Australasia's march to progress. We ask for full citizen rights...'. This protest has garnered mixed reviews, but in turn has gained support from both the aboriginal population for the AFM as well as egalitarians frustrated with left-wing politics."
austral.254.a:0 "Troubling news, indeed."
austral.255.t:0 "Farmers Request Assistance for Emu Culling"
austral.255.d:0 "Farmers in Walgoolan and Burracoppin have petitioned the government to help cull a rather large gathering of emus in the area. They asked for planes to drop small bombs on large gatherings, along with soldiers armed with machine guns to shoot down the rest, similar to the failed attempt in 1932. The Chief Game Inspector, Mr A. Arnold, stated 'The situation did not warrant mass extermination of the birds' and that inspectors had not spotted any of the so-called reported mass gatherings. The state government has also denied the request on the basis of the Mr Arnold's observation."
austral.255.a:0 "A war on Emus is unnecessary."
austral.256.t:0 "The Volunteer Defence Corps"
austral.256.d:0 "In response to the return of world war, the Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL) has been tasked with forming a militia force comprised of both Weltkrieg veterans too old to fight overseas and men too young to enlist. The intent of this militia is to create a static defence against invasion and if that was to fail, the VDC would then engage in guerrilla warfare against the invaders. From there they would delay, harass, and perhaps totally defeat an invader's plans."

austral.258.d:0 "Today both Donald Cameron and John Garden have been engaged in talks with the Labor Party leadership to re-join the party's ranks. While members within the party support the idea to bolster Labor's working-class support, others like the vocal Jack Lang have called out such an idea as ridiculous and a danger to the Labor movement. If we accept them back, there is a good chance Jack Lang will break off yet again, though the increased working-class support might be worth the risk."

austral.260.t:0 "Reconcile with Lang Labor?"
austral.260.d:0 "The possibility of finally reconciling with Jack Lang and his breakaway members of the Labor Party - though to do so would mean offering at least Lang himself a position within the Labor cabinet.

We are the possessors of rights which we must qualify to exercise, also of obligations which the Māori must discharge always in the future as he has done in the past.' Some members, however, find the idea of a sole Battalion dedicated to the Māori unsustainable due to the lower population, while others say they would be better off as supporting roles as they did during the Weltkrieg."
austral.263.a:0 "This will only help the war effort."

Witnesses reported that when Anker Madsen, one of his neighbours rode by on his bike, Stanley shot him in the leg.

Before Graham could be stopped, he took the lives of 14 across the three weeks he'd been running. While the specifics are not known as to why Mr. Graham began his spree, police reports show he had a history of threats and assault. Following the shootings, the Graham household was burned down, and the government has shifted his wife and children across the country.

His legacy however will be one of hardship and determination, which was shown when he, along with Stanley Bruce, continued to push for democratic elections at the risk of dismissal. He was also partially responsible for implementing policies to help alleviate the worst of the depression and, despite the failure of the Nationalists, he was seen fondly amongst many of the general populace for making the best of what he had."

austral.303.d.gov:0 "After 23 years of politics and controversy, Prime Minister Stanley Bruce has decided to step down as leader of the United Australasia Party. This has thrown his party into considerable chaos, with several declaring his decision untimely, and an immediate struggle has begun to find his replacement."
austral.303.d.notgov:0 "After 23 years of politics and controversy, Stanley Bruce has decided to step down as leader of the United Australasia Party. This has thrown his party into considerable chaos as they search for a replacement, though there appears to be a consensus that it was Bruce's lack of leadership which led to the party's current status. They see this as an opportunity for the UAP's renewal."
austral.303.a:0 "Robert Menzies steps up as the new UAP leader."
austral.303.b:0 "Sidney Holland becomes the first New Zealander to lead the party."
austral.304.t:0 "Collapse of the UAP/Country Coalition"
austral.304.d:0 "Earle Page, dissatisfied with the election of Robert Menzies as leader of the United Australasia Party, has launched a scathing attack on Menzies' integrity stating, 'the Australasian Government needs a leader with not merely the qualities I have mentioned, but also the three essential qualities of courage, loyalty, and judgement.' The coalition between the UAP and the Country party appears to be at a permanent end, with Page severing all agreements between the parties effective immediately."
austral.304.a:0 "What a mess."
austral.305.t:0 "Page Removed as ACP Leader"
austral.305.d:0 "Infighting within the Country Party over the end of the coalition with UAP has reached its apex, with the party unanimously removing Earle Page as leader and replacing him with Arthur Fadden."

austral.306.d:0 "Due to his decreasing health and enduring a series of leadership arguments which have rocked the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, J.B. Miles finally agreed to resign his position as leader of the Maximists. Before his resignation Miles was virtually powerless as the Chairman, with those who suggesting that his successor, Lance Sharkey, was the one who slowly eroded Miles' leadership. What has been broadcast so far implies and that Miles' resignation was far from willing, but questions regarding the matter are so far very few. Despite this Miles has reaffirmed his commitment to the Maximists and will continue to support them."
austral.306.a:0 "Too bad."
austral.307.t:0 "Death of David Murray Anderson"
austral.307.d:0 "Today all flags within Sydney are being flow at half-mast after the sudden death of Sir David Murray Anderson. Sir Anderson, the current sitting governor of New South Wales, is most famously known for his successful evacuation of the British Colonies in the East Indies, saving thousands of lives as well as a large portion of the British Pacific Fleet. While Sir Anderson has been ill for some time, leaving Sir Phillip Street to fill in for his public appearances, he has been vocal in supporting the Australasian Guard as 'the only right-thinking men in Australasia' who would be capable of enacting his plans to retake the East Indies. His death has only further built support for the right-wing movement."
austral.307.a:0 "A fine man."
austral.308.t:0 "Resignation of Fred Paterson"
austral.308.d:0 "The 'People's Champion' Fred Paterson, after years of strong leadership, has decided to step down as Chairman of the ACTU citing family and health as the reason. While he may no longer be the leader of the ACTU, he will take over as vice-chairman for the new leader. The first choice to replace him is Elsie Farrelly, a renowned socialist and feminist who made several successful strides to empower working class women. The other choice is the scholar and philosopher, John Anderson. He has pushed for many reforms to help our comrades seek higher education and pursue greater knowledge. Both are quite worthy of the position but only one can be chosen."
austral.308.a:0 "Elsie Farrely will take his place."
austral.308.b:0 "John Anderson is the appropriate choice."

The long-time leader of the Labor party, Curtin was well-respected across the country but being Prime Minister led to a sharp decline in his health over the previous few years. His body was returned to his home city of Perth on a RAAF Dakota, escorted by a flight of nine fighter aircraft. After lying in state, he was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery in Perth, with his funeral route being lined by over 100,000 people with the service itself being attended by over 30,000."

austral.310.t:0 "The New Leader of Labor"
austral.310.d:0 "With the death of Curtin, the temporary head of the Labor party, Ben Chifley, faces an election to determine whether his leadership will be permanent, or whether it will fall to the popular up-and-comer, Peter Fraser.

austral.351.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Anderson Doctrine, has laid a claim on the Melanesian Islands, citing that they were only lost due to Germany's assumption of control following the Weltkrieg, and that they are part of [From.GetNameDef]'s eminent domain."

austral.354.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Anderson Doctrine, has laid a claim on Singapore - the last bastion of the United Kingdom as it held out against Germany in the final days of the Weltkrieg.

austral.355.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government, pursuing a revanchist policy which it calls the Anderson Doctrine, has laid a claim on northern Borneo - no doubt at the prompting of the White Rajah, the man who used to run the kingdom of Sarawak as his own personal playground and would like to see it restored."

austral.367.d:0 "Now that the Home Lands have been restored, it is time we consider what to do with the lands taken via the Anderson Doctrine - they are, after all, lands we recovered for the sake of the British, while they were unable to do so on their own. It's possible they might simply let us keep it all. We did all the work, after all. Some in our cabinet are suggesting that [Root.GetNameDef] shouldn't make the offer. Australasian soldiers did shed blood for it, did we not?"
austral.367.a:0 "We should offer it back."

austral.368.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has contacted us with an offer - now that we have been restored, the lands they took in our name through the Anderson Doctrine are rightfully ours to take back, so they say. Considering that [From.GetNameDef] expended a great deal of blood and effort to get them, however, perhaps it's worth recognising that they offer more protection for these colonies than we could ever provide?"

austral.370.t:0 "We are to Keep the Colonies"

They believe that through the creation of such a united Arabia, the entire subcontinent will finally experience its true renaissance and retake its position in global politics.\n\nTo hasten this unification, a supranational organisation (§YThe League of Arab States§!) has been created and granted significant power. Should the dream of a Pan-Arab state ever want to be realised however, we will need to convince the other Arab states to partake in this initiative and give up part of their sovereignty."

irqrev.1.t:0 "Coup in Baghdad"
irqrev.1.d:0 "Instigated by a group of Iraqi officers who have been influenced by the messages of Radio Free Palestine, a division of the Iraqi army decided to take the heft in their own hands. Rallying public support against their cause, widely available due to the recent reforms, they have seized control over all military installations in the Iraqi capital and have decreed the independence of the Iraqi state.\n\nThis group of radicals, led by the young charismatic Kamil Shabib, don't enjoy the full support of the Iraqi population as many Sunnis believe he is directly compromising the security of the Iraqi plains and handing control over to the Persian state next-door."
irqrev.1.a:0 "Are we blind?!"

irq.1.t:0 "Yasin al-Hashimi Takes Control"
irq.1.d:0 "As the vacuum caused by the absence of Ottoman authority in Iraq takes hold within Baghdad, the former Müsir of the Ottoman-Iraqi army has positioned himself as the National Chief of the haphazardly proclaimed state. Although he hasn't been as brazen to deny any possibility of democracy, the influence of the Parliament in Baghdad is highly questionable. Filled with military top brass and tribal figures, it seems more an oligarchic sham to enrich themselves than a genuine attempt at providing for the people."
irq.1.a:0 "May Yasin protect our fragile independence!"

irq.2.t:0 "al-Hashimi Proclaims the Iraqi Republic"
irq.2.d:0 "With the tacit support of the Arab governments in Syria and Egypt, the Ottoman veteran and former governor of the Baghdadi vilayet, Yasin al-Hashimi, has declared the independence of a so-called 'Iraqi' state. Composed of the former vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra, the main intention behind it is to avoid further Persian and Shiite penetration of the Mashriq.\n\nAlthough the young 'republic' barely has an army outside of a few scattered Ottoman remnants, the support of the Arab world for it poses a veritable threat to our interests in the Persian Gulf. Various Shi'ite Arabs in Lower Mesopotamia share our concerns of Sunni domination and have shown themselves to be more amenable to a policy of cooperation. The Muntafiq federation especially has, in what may be a very brazen attempt to seize power, sent out feelers to gather Persian support for the declaration of an Iraqi monarchy under their leadership."

irq.3.t:0 "Tribal Unrest in Lower Mesopotamia"
irq.3.d:0 "Likely supported by the government in Teheran, various Shi'ite tribal federations have raised their flag in revolt against the questionable dictatorship of Yasin al-Hashimi. As the Iraqi state is predominately Shi'ite, they are demanding at the very least equal representation of both groups and an end to various Sunni programs set up by the Ottoman Empire. In Baghdad however, word on the street has it that these so-called revolts are a ruse by the Muntafiq federation which has much grander aims than just equality.\n\nThe leader of the revolt and coincidentally also of the Muntafiq federation, Yusuf Beg al-Sa'adun, has already sent his demands to the government in Baghdad and wants Hashimi to disband his cabinet within 48 hours or face the consequences. Rallying behind him a substantial force of irregulars, there is very little that our Iraqi national 'army' can do and it seems very likely that al-Hashimi will concede to their demands."

irq.3.b:0 "The al-Hashimi cabinet falls."

irq.4.t:0 "al-Hashimi Flees to Syria"
irq.4.d:0 "Faced with an insurmountable threat to his rule, Yasin al-Hashimi has handed his resignation to the Baghdadi chamber before embarking on an unmarked plane towards Damascus. Now left without an army and without a president, it seemed the Iraqi republic was doomed to collapse and a possible invasion by either the Egyptian-backed Syrians or forces of the Shah likely.\n\nYusuf Beg al-Sa'adun however was quick to respond and has jumped into this vacuum. Gathering support from a variety of tribal leaders and with the blessing of the Holy Cities, he has declared himself King of Iraq and taken his residence in Baghdad."
irq.4.a:0 "Long live Yusuf I!"

irq.5.t:0 "Tribal Revolt Crushed"
irq.5.d:0 "Against all odds, the small contingent under the command of Taha al-Hashimi has been able to inflict a serious defeat on the irregular forces of Yusuf Beg al-Sa'adun. The catastrophic blow to the morale of the rebels, whose lack of military training and already questionable dedication to their cause was already proving problematic, has led to a chain rout and a variety of Sheikhs pledging their allegiance to the government in Baghdad in an attempt to remain master of the situation.\n\nHero of the Republic and brother of the National Chief, Taha al-Hashimi was celebrated as a saint on the streets of Baghdad and has proven that the Iraqi army will not be so easily sullied with. Others however looked at the carnage inflicted by his troops on the lands of the Muntafiq federation and are fearful that a new tyrannical regime will not hesitate to resort to force if the need arises."
irq.5.a:0 "Allah clearly blesses the al-Hashimis!"

irq.6.t:0 "Defeat for the National Army"
irq.6.d:0 "Although initially making good progress against the forces of Yusuf Beg al-Sa'adun, this would not last and after several painful defeats and the subsequent rapid increase in desertion amongst the National forces of Taha al-Hashimi, victory quickly became impossible. Various members of the inner circle of Yasin al-Hashimi have already embarked on steamers and trains towards Syria whilst in Baghdad, the National Chief himself is trying to prevent an all-out revolt on the streets of his capital."

# Monarchy
irq.7.t:0 "The New Prime Minister?"
irq.7.d:0 "The departure of Yasin al-Hashimi from office has drastically shaken up the political cards in the capital as King Yusuf I now finds himself in the not very enviable position to restore order to the nation. Multiple cliques currently exist within the nation with the military dominated Arab nationalist group the strongest and the reformist al-Ahali looking to bring radical change to Iraqi society if given the reigns.\n\nLacking the strong leadership from al-Hashimi, the militarist clique is currently being led by his close associate Rashid al-Gaylani with a dedicated wing within the Armed Forces under the leadership of Yasin's brother, Taha al-Hashimi. Their vision of Iraq as the Prussia of the Arabs, the necessary force to bring the Arabs together, is not received very well by the Shi'ite majority who have shown more inclination towards Iraqi nationalism but as the army remains almost entirely controlled by Sunni pawns, going against them could prove very dangerous."
irq.7.a:0 "Appoint Kamil al-Chadirchi of al-Ahali."
irq.7.b:0 "Appoint Rashid al-Gaylani of the HIW."

irq.8.t:0 "The Turkish Issue"
irq.8.d:0 "Despite nowhere forming a majority, there remains a sizeable population of Turks within our borders who still control significant portions of the economy and are able to exert significant pressure on the political system. Whilst some see these Turks as a potential Fifth Column, this opinion is definitely not shared by all as especially the Sunni minority sees in them a necessary presence to prevent Iraq from becoming a Shi'ite state."
irq.8.a:0 "Their assets belong to the Iraqi State!"
irq.8.b:0 "Cooperation is a necessity!"

irq.9.t:0 "The Kurdish Minority"
irq.9.d:0 "Even though the vast majority of Kurds have fallen outside of our realm, there still exists a minority of them around the Turkmen city of Kirkuk in the Northeast of our country. These predominately Sunni Muslims have recently started protesting against the government in Baghdad as they are almost entirely ignored and lack any representation in the Iraqi parliament. As their lands are located around the important oil fields of Kirkuk, the government has in the past favoured the Turkmens of the region who have organised themselves in militia units to achieve total control over the province.\n\nTo ameliorate the issue, the Kurds have now asked the government to also allow them to arm themselves and as such ward of future Turkmen expansion. Furthermore they want guarantees that free, open elections will be held within their territory and that they can represent their interests in the Iraqi parliament."
irq.9.a:0 "This seems agreeable."
irq.9.b:0 "This is not in our interests."

irq.10.t:0 "Massacre in Makhmur"
irq.10.d:0 "Tensions between Kurds and Turkmens came to a head in Makhmur earlier this week as a group of Kurdish tribesmen descended on a small Turkmen village and sacked it. Furious at this blatant act of aggression, the leadership of the Turkmen militias retaliated in force and laid waste to multiple Kurdish villages in the province of Makhmur. Slaying at least a hundred villagers and forcing at least 1000 others to flee their homes, the Iraqi army was unable to arrive in time and put an end to the conflict.\n\nThis incapacity of the army to intervene quickly has angered much of its leadership which has put the full blame on the ineffective government in Baghdad which refuses to anger the sizeable minorities upstream. To solve the crisis, they now demand the full authority to break up the militias and drastically increase the size of the army. Whilst this would allow the government to exert its power more effectively in Northern Iraq, many others see in this a power move by the army and a risk to the political security of the Iraqi state."
irq.10.a:0 "Break up the militias!"
irq.10.b:0 "This seems unnecessary."

irq.11.t:0 "Yasin al-Hashimi Requests Permission to Return"
irq.11.d:0 "Fleeing the country after the march of King Yusuf I on the capital, the former Ottoman Müsir has requested permission to return to his homeland. As the head of the powerful military clique, his return is likely to radically shake up Iraqi politics but it may prove to be a necessary evil as the constant failure of the army to effectively act against tribal elements proves that an experienced military leader such as himself could prove essential in the preservation of our shaky state."
irq.11.a:0 "Allow him back in."
irq.11.b:0 "This is not within our interests."

irq.12.t:0 "Triumph in Turkeli"
irq.12.d:0 "Acting with an as of before unseen ruthlessness, the Turkmen militias were crushed earlier today after their confrontation with the Iraqi Royal Army. Fighting bravely till the end to preserve their autonomy within the Iraqi kingdom, the young Arab general Kamil Shabib proved his mettle and used scorched earth tactics to force the Turkmen forces to face him on the field. As reports trickle in about the execution of unarmed women and children, various Turkmen leaders being attached to the back of cars and pulled around the city of Kirkuk and other crimes not seen since the Assyrian genocide during the Weltkrieg, Turkmen resistance was completely crushed.\n\nOver in Baghdad however, these reports were received with great enthusiasm as even the progressive al-Ahali cheered on the general for his decisive action. Within the palace walls, some fear however that the general may have been *too* successful as it has created a cult of personality around his figure and effectively made him kingmaker within the armed forces."
irq.12.a:0 "Most disturbing..."

irq.13.t:0 "Coup d'Etat in Baghdad"
irq.13.d:0 "Bolstered by the popularity of Kamil Shabib and lingering support amongst the military for the exiled Yasin al-Hashimi, troops from the second infantry division stormed the palace earlier today and took control of the state. Citing ineffective rule by the, now deposed, king Yusuf I, they have abolished the monarchy all together and proclaimed the Iraqi 'Republic' to replace it. Whilst the Iraqi parliament remains open and the military has the full intention to keep the charade of democracy up, to many it is now clear that a military junta is here to stay.\n\nYasin himself could also be seen earlier today returning from his exile and meeting with the first president of the republic and his friend, Rashid al-Gaylani. It remains unclear whether he will demand his position as 'National Chief' back or will remain content with a high position within the al-Gaylani cabinet but his imprint will definitely be noticeable on the new regime."
irq.13.a:0 "We brace ourselves for the future..."

# Military Regime
irq.14.t:0 "Revision of the Armed Forces"
irq.14.d:0 "Bolstered by Yasin's confidence in the prowess of the former Ottoman Sixth Army, plans for its rapid expansion have been presented to parliament earlier today and unanimously accepted. Despite this overwhelming 'democratic' victory however, there remains substantial opposition to the plan as the main brunt of the foot soldiers this plan requires are to be conscripted from the Shi'ite Arabs who have shown a less than amazing tendency to ignore directives from the capital.\n\nNonetheless the 'National Chief' is confident that he is capable to bring the population in line and has started an initiative to include more Shi'ites in his decision making process. This in turn however has sparked consternation from many of his Sunni associates who are fearing for their own positions in the reshuffled cabinet."
irq.14.a:0 "Iraq needs to project power or perish trying!"

irq.15.t:0 "The Yasin Cabinet"
irq.15.d:0 "Perhaps surprising friend and foe alike, the new government of the 'National Chief' is one which attempts to mend the great political divides present within our nation. In this he has included a variety of Shi'ite figures and even presented a peace offering to the leader of al-Ahali by offering him the Education ministry, an offer he swiftly accepted.\n\nMany in the opposition have however raised their eyebrows at this bizarre display and are seriously questioning the intention of al-Hashimi. Prominent members of the various minority groups have also protested as the lack of an Assyrian and/or Turkoman representation still greatly weighs on their respective communities."
irq.15.a:0 "A glass to the new government!"

irq.16.t:0 "al-Gaylani Breaks with al-Hashimi"
irq.16.d:0 "Furious at his exclusion from the cabinet, former partner and Arab nationalist Rashid al-Gaylani has slammed the door on his colleague. As the man still holds substantial leverage amongst the Iraqi officer corps, it is likely that he will likely serve as the figurehead of the most radical pan-Arabists of the nation. Many of these, disgruntled by the focus of al-Hashimi on Iraqi nationalism first and Arab nationalism second and his decision to appoint the social democratic al-Chadirchi as minister of education, harbour sympathies less compatible with the plans of the 'National Chief' and could prove to be a liability in the future.\n\nNonetheless, the situation may still be salvageable if al-Gaylani is granted a position within the government. Pushed on by the al-Muthanna club of Yasin's brother, Taha al-Hashimi, it may be in our interests to remove al-Chadirchi from office and replace him with al-Gaylani."
irq.16.a:0 "Extend an olive branch to al-Gaylani."
irq.16.b:0 "What can that fool even do to harm us?"

irq.17.t:0 "Assassination of Yasin al-Hashimi"
irq.17.d:0 "Even though the tensions between the Arab nationalist support base of al-Hashimi and the 'National Chief' had been coming to a head for some time now, many were still surprised by the brazen power grab of al-Gaylani. Yasin who had been inspecting the new airbase of the IQAF near Baghdad was shot in plain daylight by a low-rank officer at the facility and died instantaneously.\n\nThe plotters used the confusion immediately after the fact to seize control of various garrisons in and around Baghdad, with Rashid al-Gaylani quick to appoint himself as the new 'National Chief' of the Iraqi Republic.\n\nDespite the speed and ease with which they overthrew the regime, many question whether al-Gaylani will be able to stabilise the state as even within the army there are those that would rather see him go as quickly as he came."
irq.17.a:0 "Long live Rashid al-Gaylani!"

irq.18.t:0 "Taha al-Hashimi Attacks Baghdad"
irq.18.d:0 "Outraged by the attack on his brother, Taha al-Hashimi has gathered the forces of Mosul and Kirkuk to launch an attack on the capital and depose the regime of al-Gaylani. Supported by a variety of local groups, especially amongst the Shi'ite tribes, he poses a veritable threat to disorganised forces in and around the capital.\n\nNonetheless, Rashid al-Gaylani has prepared as well as he could and has handed over full command to the relatively young general Kamil Shabib whose recent successes against the tribal insurrections have made him an important player within the armed forces and a rallying point for the wavering troops."
irq.18.a:0 "The forces of al-Hashimi are defeated."
irq.18.b:0 "Taha al-Hashimi defeats Kamil Shabib."

irq.19.t:0 "al-Gaylani Consolidates His Position"
irq.19.d:0 "After the heroic victory over the al-Hashimi loyalists, all significant military opposition to the new regime seems quelled. The new 'National Chief' who used to be a partner of the late Yasin al-Hashimi, follows closely the rhetoric of the al-Muthanna club who preach for the unification of Arabia with Iraq acting as the equivalent of Prussia during the 19th century.\n\nTheir harsh critique of the Turkoman and Assyrian minorities however show that their idea of an Arab state is one solely targeted at ethnic Arabs and that there is no place in there for the 'distractions' posed by these groups. Another clear target of the new regime is the substantial Jewish population of Baghdad who they see as nothing but a fifth column out to destroy the Arab soul and vultures praying on the livelihoods of honest Muslims."
irq.19.a:0 "Dark times are ahead of us..."

irq.20.t:0 "al-Hashimi Stands Victorious"
irq.20.d:0 "With a clear victory over the shaky forces of al-Gaylani, the brother of the late Yasin al-Hashimi has taken vengeance for the assassination of the former earlier this year. Despite proving his mettle on the field of battle however, his position remains far from secure as the power of the Sunni Arab elite has been greatly broken and he now has to rely on a shaky coalition of Shi'ites, minority politicians and the support of al-Ahali.\n\nA second option however also presents itself and seems more likely for the newly appointed 'National Chief'. By cooperating with the various tribal chieftains, he may still be able to create a workable government and prevent al-Ahali from undoing the work of his brother."

irq.21.d:0 "Led by their leader Kamil al-Chadirchi, the fairly young political organisation of Jamaat al-Ahali has been given the reins to execute their designs on the nation. Unlike many other 'parties' (read: cliques), they seem to show a genuine interest in free democracy and gradual social reforms to aid the colossal caste of toilers and farmers who have under the Ottoman regime ultimately been unable to enjoy much of the recent reforms.\n\nThe party calls itself inspired by the Fabian ideology originating in the former British Empire but has brought clear Iraqi tones to the ideas. The party furthermore steps away from the pan-Arab rhetoric employed by the al-Hashimis and the al-Muthanna club in favour of an inclusive Iraqi nationalism, inspired by its Mesopotamian heritage."
irq.21.a:0 "We will watch them with great interest."

irq.22.t:0 "Creation of the 'Nadi Baghdad'"
irq.22.d:0 "As the program of al-Ahali calls for great social reform without revolution, the party has encountered great issues when convincing the common folk of Iraq of their necessity. Even larger an issue, many of the 'nouveau riche' in the capital seem more interested in the calls of al-Muthanna than those of its opposition.\n\nTo remedy this 'intellectual deficit', 'Abd al-Fattah Ibrahim has founded the Nadi Baghdad (Baghdad Club) as a circle for young Iraqis to educate themselves and convince them of the need for reform. As overt political propaganda is likely to only deter support from the public, the club features mainly as a cultural centre for meetings and debates."

irq.23.t:0 "Publication of Kifah al-Sha'b"
irq.23.d:0 "To strengthen their hold on Iraqi politics, the socialist party of Iraq under its leader Yusuf Salman Yusuf has launched a new paper for the masses. Calling it 'the mouthpiece of the workers and the peasants', this newspaper comes straight from the Central Committee and should as such be kept under close scrutiny for it may start to become a thorn in the side of our already shaky government.\n\nNonetheless Yusuf, or commonly referred to as Comrade Fahd has guaranteed al-Chadirchi that he will maintain his support for the al-Ahali government so long as they continue to strive for the common goal of social reform."

To show their intentions, the party has also announced a test project in a variety of districts wherein women will be able to vote in their local elections. The idea to immediately decree nationwide, universal elections was refused in parliament by the conservative representatives but is surely to be proposed again in the near future."
irq.24.a:0 "A bold move."

irq.25.t:0 "Friction within the Iraqi Parliament"
irq.25.d:0 "Now that the full scope of al-Ahalis economic reforms has become apparent, many Baghdadi elites and tribal leaders are starting to push back more strongly against their desires to implement a progressive tax system and most explicitly the desire to redistribute Miri land. This land, which used to be owned directly by the Ottoman state, has after its collapse been overtaken by local chiefs and landholders who whilst not having a fully legal claim to the land are unlikely to return it to the state unless forced by military force.\n\nDespite all the best endeavours by al-Chadirchi and his supporters, these still hold significant power within all layers of Iraqi society and are now pressuring the man to resign and hold new elections. Their words are backed up by an increase in tribal unrest in Southern Iraq where various groups have in an attempt to protect their monopoly on power have taken up arms against the government."

Despite the overwhelming success however, this event is sure to go into the history books as a black spot on the prestige of al-Ahali whose dreams of peaceful social transformation have now inevitably caused its first deaths.\n\nFor better or worse, the Socialist Party has praised the actions of the Army and has decreed them the vanguard of the nearing red tide. Despite attempts by al-Chadirchi to try and smother their words, this is likely going to have a detrimental impact on our allies in the South."

With promises to al-Ahali that he will preserve freedom of speech and not tear down their reforms, he is likely to just maintain the new status-quo and focus on the economic sector. Despite being liberal minded as opposed to the more socialist al-Ahali, he still promises extensive public works projects and a general expansion of Iraqi infrastructure."
irq.27.a:0 "Good luck with that."

# al-Muthanna coup backed by Syria
irq.28.t:0 "Assassination of [IRQ.GetLeader]"
irq.28.d:0 "Travelling down the streets of Baghdad in his open car to visit the Mosque, [IRQ.GetLeader] was taken down by a militia member associated with the al-Muthanna club. As by clockwork, various groups within the military apparatus quickly took control over the state in a, mostly, bloodless coup. Tanks rolling down the streets towards public institutions were met by stunned faces amongst the Baghdadi citizens but were able to achieve their objectives with little to no resistance.\n\nWhilst the initial phase of the coup has been extremely successful, word is travelling quickly amongst the tribes and it is very likely that the events set in motion by the al-Muthanna club will plunge Iraq into a state of civil war unless the former allies of [IRQ.GetLeader] are dealt with quickly."
irq.28.a:0 "W-wha?"

irq.29.t:0 "Fawzi al-Quwaitli Crosses the Border"
irq.29.d:0 "Known Arab desperado and famous militia leader, Fawzi al-Quwaitli has seemingly crossed the Syrian border into Iraq under the cover of pursuing a group of Kurdish fighters that fled from a military campaign in Northern Syria. Not only is this a blatant breach of our internationally recognised border but many fear that his real purpose is to support Arab nationalists around Mosul who have shown their discontent with the current regime in Baghdad.\n\nA statement from the Syrian government has been issued, promising that the incident was nothing more than an accident and that it has already demanded the man to return to their country. As al-Quwaitli however officially isn't part of the Syrian army but of his own militia organisation, it's unlikely that he will heed their call and we may need to act with force to kick him back out."
irq.29.a:0 "Send in the army."
irq.29.b:0 "We will trust their word..."

irq.30.t:0 "al-Quwaitli Pushed back into Syria"
irq.30.d:0 "Facing severe opposition from the Iraqi army, the small insurgent group under the leadership of Fawzi al-Quwaitly has seen itself forced to retreat back into Syria. Whilst he was only a small pawn in the grander game, this defeat has made our allies in Iraq question whether we can really support them or whether it's just words and no deeds."
irq.30.a:0 "Well, that's unfortunate."

irq.31.t:0 "Yasin al-Hashimi Rumoured to Have Returned"
irq.31.d:0 "Former Müsir of the Iraqi forces and temporary leader of the Iraqi republic, Yasin al-Hashimi is rumoured to have returned from his exile in Syria after he was forced to flee his home country in the coup against his government. Even though the man no longer serves as the dictator of our nation, his influence and power amongst the (Sunni) Iraqi elite can not be underestimated and his control over the armed forces could pose a serious danger to the position of our government."
irq.31.a:0 "FIND. THAT. MAN!"

# Foreign Policy
irqfor.1.t:0 "[IRQ.GetNameDef] Wants to Join Our Faction"
irqfor.1.d:0 "Tucked away between the Arab powers of Egypt and Syria on the one hand and the Persians on the other, the nation of Iraq holds enormous geopolitical importance in its area furthermore strengthened by the discovery of seemingly endless petroleum reservoirs underneath its barren soil.\n\nComing to us now with a proposal to join forces and rid the world of our common enemies, this seems like a golden opportunity to expand our influence eastwards."
irqfor.1.a:0 "Welcome to the club!"
irqfor.1.b:0 "We have no use of their nation."

irqfor.2.t:0 "Offer Accepted"
irqfor.2.d:0 "The gracious government of [FROM.GetName] has accepted our offer, giving us a seat at the table and promising to assist us in times of both war and peace."
irqfor.2.a:0 "Great!"

irqfor.3.t:0 "Offer Refused"
irqfor.3.d:0 "The despicable government of [FROM.GetName] has refused our offer, stating that we are but a useless medieval 'state' in the desert with disillusions of grandeur."
irqfor.3.a:0 "SAD!"

irqfor.4.t:0 "[IRQ.GetNameDef] Invites Us to Participate in the League of Arab States"
irqfor.4.d:0 "Founded as a counter to ever increasing influence of Egypt over the Arab world, the Iraqi government has invited us today to join their coalition and officiate our entrance to the League through a joint treaty of Eternal Friendship."
irqfor.4.a:0 "We will support their endeavours."
irqfor.4.b:0 "Who do they think they are?"

irqfor.5.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] joins the League"
irqfor.5.d:0 "Fantastic news in Baghdad today as representatives from [FROM.GetName] put their signature under the Friendship Treaty, ratifying their entry to the League and promising a fruitful relation between our two states."
irqfor.5.a:0 "Welcome!"

irqfor.6.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Rebukes Our Offer"
irqfor.6.d:0 "Unwilling to get involved with any partnerships concerning the state of Iraq, the government of [FROM.GetName] has refused our offer to join the League and has stated it will continue its course on their own."
irqfor.6.a:0 "Most regrettable."

irqfor.7.t:0 "Triumph in the Levant"
irqfor.7.d:0 "After a successful campaign and full military occupation over the Levant, the Egyptian forces and their lackeys have finally been driven out of the Levant and have been unable to mount a counteroffensive against our forces. Due to such current conditions, we are now in the position to initiate peace in exchange for ownership over Syria. Despite this prospect, some within our command are convinced to continue the fight, and finally snuff out Egypt and their imperialist schemes once and for all. Nevertheless, how must we approach this matter?"
irqfor.7.a:0 "Send the peace delegation, our brethren are finally united."
irqfor.7.b:0 "We shall march all the way to Cairo!"

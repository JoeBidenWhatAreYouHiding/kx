### Ideas ###

KUB_Divided_Region: "Divided Region"
KUB_Divided_Region_desc: "According to popular opinion, in the flag of Kuban the blue color symbolizes the Russian-speaking Cossacks, the crimson color symbolizes the Ukrainian-speaking Cossacks, and the green color symbolizes the Muslim minority.\n\nIn reality, the divide is different. Not only Kuban is divided between different peoples, nationalities and social groups by culture, income, origin and position. The real division is between the cossack majority and peasant minority, that brings a lot of instability to the politics and economy. Further division can lead to even more significant instability."
KUB_KPA: "Kuban Insurgent Army"
KUB_KPA_desc: "Soon after the final annexation of Kuban first to the White Army and then to the new, restored Russia, active guerrilla uprisings began in the region, initiated by the Kuban Insurgent Army under the leadership of Vasil Ryabokon. It was they who eventually contributed to the seizure of power in Kuban in 1925. Despite the fact that power was peacefully transferred to the reconstituted Kuban Provincial Rada, the influence of the KPA was still significant."
KUB_Unification_Sentiments: "Integration Sentiments"
KUB_Unification_Sentiments_desc: "In the past there have been several attempts to reunite Kuban with Ukraine. However, the hesitance of the Hetman government eventually led to the seizure of Kuban by the White armies.\nDuring the last 10 years of the Black Sea government, it seems that reunification with Ukraine is nothing more than a political game and a flirting with Ukrainophile sentiments in society. Perhaps the Kuban and Ukrainian governments can agree on Kuban joining the Kingdom, but how will other forces within the people's republic perceive this?"
KUB_Unification_Sentiments_1: "Kuban-Ukrainian Convention"
KUB_Unification_Sentiments_1_desc: "We have signed the convention with the Ukrainian government, which allows their forces and enter our territory and water area. This is just a next step towards full integration."

KUB_lecagy_civil_war: "The Russian Civil War has left its scars here just as it did anywhere else in the former Russian Empire. Influencing our military, our politics, and even the general mindset of the people, the shadow the conflict has left will likely not be cleansed anytime soon."
KUB_rada: "Kuban Rada"
KUB_rada_desc: "Kubanskaya Rada (Kuban Rada) is the only truly democratic force in all of the Caucasus Region. Even though the decisions it make are heavily dependent on the Cooperatives, Cossack Hosts and Insurgent Army, people still have a chance to vote for the candidate they prefer with a confidence that there is no rigging or fraud."

KUB_Circassians_back: "Autonomy for Circassians"

### Cooperation ###
KUB_Powerful_Cooperation_Movement_decisions: "Powerful Cooperation Movement"
KUB_Powerful_Cooperation_Movement_decisions_desc: "Unlike other parts of the collapsed empire, Kuban is known for its massive, widespread and extremely powerful cooperative movement. For several decades, cooperation has developed in the region, and there are now several consumer cooperatives, the most prominent among them being Kubsoyuz and Yuskvet. \n\nCooperation helped Kuban become a breadbasket during the civil war, and during independence, helped it become an overly wealthy and prosperous region of the Black Sea. \n\nHowever, along with this, the cooperatives' influence on the internal and external politics of the Krai also rose, and in many ways they became the shadow government of the republic.\n\n£GFX_no_order_texticon Capacity of State Support: §H[?KUB_cooperatives_upper_limit|0]%§!\n\n£GFX_production_texticon  Labour Cooperatives: §R[?KUB_cooperatives_workers_level|0]%§!\n£GFX_texticon_UKR_coop_agr  Agrarian Cooperatives: §G[?KUB_cooperatives_agrarian_level|0]%§!\n£GFX_texticon_UKR_coop_cons  Consumer Cooperatives: §C[?KUB_cooperatives_consumer_level|0]%§!\n£GFX_capital  Credit Cooperatives: §Y[?KUB_cooperatives_credit_level|0]%§!\n\nIf any £GFX_texticon_UKR_coop Level is §Rexceeding§! £GFX_no_order_texticon Capacity of State Support, debuffs will be applied.\n\n[KUB_GetCooperativesModifiers]§YThe modifiers update monthly or when forced.§!"

However, most of the ships were not subjects to restoration.

KUB_Kuban_Ukrainian_Convention_desc: "The 1936 Kuban-Ukrainian Convention, drafted by Luka Bych, current foreign minister, suggests even greater integration into Ukrainian sphere of influence.

### Events ###
kub.1.t: "History of the Kuban People's Republic"
kub.1.d: "Proclaimed in 1918, the Kuban People's Republic found itself at the center of political strife in the Don-Kuban region. Power changed hands several times, and the indecisiveness of Hetman Ukraine prevented the Kuban from defending itself against its enemies. As a result, it was annexed to the Armed Forces of Southern Russia. In response, an insurgent movement led by Ryabokon in the Kuban flared up.\n\nThis was until 1925, when instability in Russia led to the separation of the Don, Kuban and North Caucasus from Russia. Power passed into the hands of the Kuban Insurgent Army, which revived the People's Republic and the Rada.\n\nVasil Ivanis, a prominent leader of the pro-Ukrainian Black Sea faction, was elected the new ataman of the republic.\nStable economic growth, a strong cooperative movement, and democratic traditions allowed Kuban to become one of the most successful splinters of the former Russian empire. \n\nHowever, incessant conflicts between the two parliamentary factions, pro-Ukrainian and pro-Russian, wore down our politics, but at the same time ensured good relations with both Russia and Ukraine. However, who knows if this is just the calm before the storm."
kub.1.a: "You, Kuban, you're our Motherland!"

kub.2.t: "Black Monday Hits Kuban"
kub.2.d: "The Berlin Stock Crisis has reached Kuban as well. With our neighboring Don Republic also feeling their part of the devastation brought on by the disaster, the Germans have begun withdrawing their businesses, investments, and other forms of capital from our nation, further crippling our economy. We are in a free fall, and must act quickly in order to save our nation from total ruin."
kub.2.a: "It's a disaster!"

kub.3.t: "Nikolay Bukretov Passes Away!"
kub.3.d: "The recent news reports that one of the officers of the Kuban People's Republic, former Ataman in 1919, Nikolay Bukretov, has suddenly passed away at the age of 60, being found dead in his study early this morning."
kub.3.a: "Rest in peace!"

kub.4.t: "Elections of the New Ataman"
kub.4.d: "After the elections, the Rada should vote on a new ataman. There are several main candidates from each major faction of the Rada: Vasil Ivanis, supported by pro-Ukrainian Chernomortsy, Vasil Ryabokon, the KPA leader, Aleksandr Filimonov, supported by pro-Russian Lineitsy and Vyacheslav Naumenko, another candidate from Lineitsy. It is likely that the Rada will choose the candidate from the ruling faction..." 
kub.4.a: "Let us wait for the result."

kub.5.t: "New Ataman Elected"
kub.5.d: "The last of the campaign stops have ended and the race is over, and the Rada is finally ready to announce who they have chosen to appoint as the new Ataman after weeks of deliberation and debate."
kub.5.a: "Ivanis is re-elected Ataman"
kub.5.b: "Filimonov is chosen as Ataman!"
kub.5.c: "Nikolai Ryabovol is elected instead of Ivanis! Kuban and Ukraine will become a whole!"
kub.5.e: "Lineitsy managed to negotiate Naumenko candidacy"

kub.6.t: "1936 Kuban Elections"
kub.6.d: "This year in the elections there are several political forces participating: the Chernomortsy, who are allied with Ukraine, and Lineitsy, who are allied with Russia. The result will depend on the popularity of the parties amongst the citizens and their comparative power in the Rada."
kub.6.a: "Chernomortsy Victorious!"
kub.6.b: "Lineitsy manage to win!"

kub.7.t: "Start the Spring Session"

kub.7.a: "Exciting!"

kub.8.t: "Nikolay Ryabovol Opening Speech"
kub.8.d: "Nikolay Ryabovol, one of the leaders of the Chernomortsy faction, has spoken today in the Rada, demanding further cooperation with Mitteleuropa. He emphasizes cooperation with Germany in particular as a means to protect against Russian aggression but also seeks to work closely with the Ukranians.\nAs the question of Kuban's foreign policy still remains unsolved, the topic of becoming a member of the German sphere of influence is a fast growing to be another hot debate between the deputies."
kub.8.a: "Chernomortsy trying to draw us away from Russia."

kub.9.t: "Filimonov's Address to the Nation"
kub.9.d: "Aleksandr Filimonov has presented the Lineitsy's 1936 National Budget, which includes amendments that call for fierce cooperation with Russian government. While many claim that Filimonov's speech is a criticizing response to Ryabovol's Ukrainophile plan, the idea of returning back to Russia is a popular idea amongst many Kuban citizens."
kub.9.a: "Chernomortsy and Lineitsy argue as usual."

kub.10.t: "The Upcoming Elections"
kub.10.d: "This year also brings with it the new legislative regional elections, with an active political campaign of both Chernomortsy and Lineitsy. Currently, Chernomortsy hold the majority in the parliament, having 32 seats out of 60 in the Rada and Luka Bych being the current prime minister and chairman of Rada.\nThis will be a challenge for Lineitsy to get the majority, however, they also have plenty of supporters in Kuban to tap into for support."
kub.10.a: "Who will win?"

kub.11.t: "Direction of the Economy"
kub.11.d: "With Ataman Bukretov trying to keep Kuban's neutrality, both factions in the Rada have their own economic plans for Kuban. While the Chernomortsy look forward to cooperating with prosperous economies of Germany and Ukraine, the Lineitsy see our future with Russia and its developing economy. While some predict the very end of the German economy, some hope that the new Russian government will become a vital world economy in the next few years. Do we go with the struggling giant or the possible up and coming power?"
kub.11.a: "The Chernomortsy are right - we must cooperate with Germany."
kub.11.b: "The Lineitsy are right - Russia has potential."

kub.13.t: "Kuban Asks for a Bailout"
kub.13.d: "The government of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our problems first, Kuban can be a vital ally in our confrontation with Russia and open the Caucasus to us - and its black gold."
kub.13.a: "Help them a bit."
kub.13.b: "Promise something, do nothing."
kub.13.c: "We must think of our own people now."

kub.14.t: "Germany Agreed to Help"

kub.14.a: "Splendid!"

kub.15.t: "Germany Promise to Help"
kub.15.d: "Germany promised to help our economy to recover. However, their help is not totally guaranteed. But we can rely on this information and try to get closer to Germany in the future."
kub.15.a: "Something, at least."

kub.16.t: "Germany Refused to Help"
kub.16.d: "German government refused to help us! This is a great disappointment for Chernomortsy and their voters."
kub.16.a: "Perhaps we shall work with Russia then?"

kub.17.d: "The government of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our own problems first, it can be a first step to peacefully return Kuban into the Motherland."
kub.17.c: "We don't negotiate with traitors."

kub.18.t: "Russia Agreed to Help"
kub.18.d: "Russia agreed to help us, despite all the instability. This is a great victory for Lineitsy, indeed, as it opens ways for further cooperation with Russia."

kub.19.t: "Russia Promised to Help"
kub.19.d: "Russia promised to help our economy to recover. However, their help is not totally guaranteed. But we can rely on this information and try to get closer to Russia in the future."

kub.20.t: "Russia Refused to Help"
kub.20.d: "Russian government refused to help us! This is a great disappointment for the Lineitsy and their voters."
kub.20.a: "Perhaps we shall work with Germany then?"

kub.21.t: "Economy Recovers"
kub.21.d: "Thanks to all the measures, our economy has begun to slowly recover from the Berlin Stock Crisis. Though far from over, our recovery is now well on its way. Soon, our economy will be back to its pre-collapse form."
kub.21.a: "Amazing!"

kub.22.t: "Language Issue"
kub.22.d: "Same as parliamentary factions, our nation is split between Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking regions. However, Ukrainian is still not an official language in our country, despite all the efforts made by Chernomortsy. This issue shall be solved this year, and Chernomortsy are already promising to finally solve it."
kub.22.a: "A great pre-election promise."

kub.23.t: "Circassian Minority"
kub.23.d: "The nation, known as Circassians or Adyghe is a muslim minority, that lives in the West Circassia and North Caucasus districts in Kuban. While their district have representation in the Rada with North Caucasus having 4 seats and West Circassia only 1 seat, they are held by Chernomortsy or Lineitsy deputies. The Circassians de-facto have no representation in the parliament and currently they don't have equal rights with other Kuban citizens. This issue has been a headache since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic, leading to strained relations with the Mountain Republic who recognize Circassia as a part of their state. We shall guarantee equal rights for Circassians in the following convocation of Rada."
kub.23.a: "Another issue to deal with."  

kub.25.t: "The Peasantry-Cossack Conflict"
kub.25.d: "Since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic, the conflict between cossacks and peasantry has been a major problem. The cossacks, who make up less than half of our nation’s population, own 80% of land and production while local peasantry live in poverty and squalor. When Kuban once again declared its independence in 1925, the situation became much better, with peasants gaining voting rights and their farmland being nationalized under the state and out of greedy corporate hands. However, the policy of Ataman Bukretov led to further oppression of peasants. The Rada should do something about this, either helping peasants and farmers, or finally centralising our state under Cossack rule."
kub.25.a: "Favour the peasants."
kub.25.b: "Favour the cossacks."

kub.27.t: "Sochi"
kub.27.d: "The region of Sochi, especially the city of Sochi itself, is populated by Russians and Ukrainians in a large majority over the ruling Georgians. However, Georgia stole these lands from us when our great state was oppressed under Russia boot of the Tsarist regime of old. Now, we get numerous reports from the local population that Georgians are oppressing them! We can either demand the return of this land, or keep the status-quo intact, hoping the situation will get any better soon..."
kub.27.a: "Demand Sochi back."
kub.27.c: "Save the status-quo."

kub.28.t: "Georgia Accepts."
kub.28.d: "Georgia has agreed to return Sochi to us without a drop of blood being spilt. This is a great victory for our foreign ministry and for the Kuban people as a whole. Let us celebrate at once!"
kub.28.a: "Splendid."

kub.29.t: "Georgia Refused."
kub.29.d: "Georgia has refused our request to return the region of Sochi to our hands. This is a travesty, and a slap in the face to our international prestige. Shall we slink back into our holes or stand strong and meet the Georgian menace on the field of battle?."
kub.29.a: "Sochi is Kuban!"
kub.29.b: "We cannot seize it right now..." 

kub.290.t: "Peace with Kuban?"
kub.290.d: "The Kuban forces have occupied our territory of Sochi. We can either sign a peace treaty and end the war, avoiding the spilling of innocent [ROOT.GetAdjective] lives, or we can stand vigilant and defend our borders and their integrity from these cossack aggressors."
kub.290.a: "Offer them peace."
kub.290.b: "We will never surrender."

kub.291.t: "[FROM.GetName] Offers Peace"
kub.291.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] offered us peace and Sochi. Our military might has scared them into offering up the territory we claim before any serious amount of lives are thrown away in needless conflict. What shall be our response?"
kub.291.a: "Accept the treaty, Sochi was always the goal."
kub.291.b: "We shall destroy [FROM.GetName]."

kub.292.t: "Peace over Sochi?"
kub.292.d: "We were unable to occupy Sochi. We must send a peace delegation to stop this aimless war. Hopefully we can prevent further needless bloodshed."
kub.292.a: "Send the delegation at once!"

kub.293.t: "Sochi Is Ours!"
kub.293.d: "In combat at the borders of the city of Sochi we managed to finally crush the Georgian Army and protect Sochi. The Georgians must accept their defeat!"
kub.293.a: "Sochi is our rightful territory!"

kub.294.t: "Sochi Is Ours!"
kub.294.d: "Despite the Cossacks have seized our land, we managed to bring it back under our control, kicking the Kubans out of Sochi region they have been occupying."
kub.294.a: "Sochi is our rightful territory!"

kub.295.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Sochi!"
kub.295.d: "The region of Sochi, occupied by our forces during the Russian Civil War, has been as well ratified in the Treaty of Minsk as our rightful territory. However, now the Kuban government demands that we return the city of Sochi!"
kub.295.a: "We can't afford such conflicts now."
kub.295.b: "Sochi is Georgia!"

kub.30.t: "Reforming the Rada"
kub.30.d: "While the traditional system of Kuban Rada has been keeping our nation together with Chernomortsy and Lineitsy counterbalancing each other, we should adapt a more democratic and more pro-Russian system of State Duma: a regular parliament with open elections. The Rada will be disbanded and the State Duma should appear instead."
kub.30.a: "Let's do this."

kub.35.t: "Investments in [FROM.GetName]?"
kub.35.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has approached us with a request to invest in their economy, promising great profit and also beneficial trade contracts, considering grain and oil."
kub.35.a: "Sounds great, we're in!"
kub.35.b: "We have money to spend elsewhere."

kub.36.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"

kub.37.a: "Great!"

kub.100.t: "Pokrovsky’s Coup"
kub.100.d: "Today, the armed cossack forces of general Viktor Pokrovsky have rushed into the Ataman's residence in Yekaterinodar and arrested him. Soon after, Pokrovsky proclaimed himself the new Ataman of the Republic and dissolved the Rada. Due to the incompetence of the former government, especially in its failure of its duties to protect people, as Pokrovsky argued, his duty is to save his Motherland and its people from chaos and anarchy."
kub.100.a: "Pokrovsky will protect us."

kub.200.t: "The Don-Kuban Union?"
kub.200.d: "The peoples of Don and Kuban are ethnically, culturally and politically one people in all senses of the word, with only insignificant borders dividing us. We should end this era of separation and humiliation, and finally proclaim the United Don-Kuban republic, a republic for all cossacks between the Black and Caspian seas!"
kub.200.a: "Send the offer to the Don Republic"
kub.200.b: "Declare war on those who occupy these lands!"

kub.201.t: "The Don-Kuban Union?"
kub.201.d: "The government of the Don-Kuban Union has offered to join them in a union. While our nations can be similar in a variety of facts, our political interests can differ greatly."
kub.201.a: "Accept their offer - the Cossacks shall be united."
kub.201.b: "Nonsense! We will never agree to such a silly proposal."

kub.202.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed!"
kub.202.d: "The Don government agreed to sign the Union treaty. We shall march hand in hand under the banner of a united Don-Kuban Union! Finally, peace and unity has reached the land between two seas."
kub.202.a: "Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo!"

kub.203.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused!"
kub.203.d: "The Don government refused to sign the Union treaty. Those traitorous dogs do not know what they are missing, and now our union shall be left to die unless we draw blood. We can either crush these fools and reinstate the great Don-Kuban Union by force, or let the idea fade into the dustbin of history."
kub.203.a: "We shall crush these traitors!"
kub.203.b: "War will only tear us apart, abandon the idea."

kub.999.d: "The crash of the Berlin markets has destroyed people's confidence and seriously affected our agricultural capabilities.\n\nWith this in mind, the Chernomortsy faction has proposed a Relief Bill to the Kuban Rada today. However, we don't have a majority to quickly adopt this Law. The leader of Chernomortsy faction in Rada has already called for national unity and adoption of the bill, though it is expected that Lineitsy can abstain en-masse."
kub.999.a: "Let us hope the Rada will agree on this."

kub.998.t: "Vote of No Confidence in Ivanis Cabinet"
kub.998.d: "The authoritarian nature of Ataman's actions has sparkled great unrest among the Rada members. Quickly, the opposition initiated the vote of no confidence in the government and Ataman, calling for his immediate resignation. With elections soon to come they believe that Ataman can use his power to re-schedule them and stay in power.\nThe real question is if Ivanis is ready to take contradictory steps to stay in power and lead Chernomortsy to eventual victory over the Lineitsy."
kub.998.a: "Ataman dissolves Rada until further notice"
kub.998.b: "Democracy is saved, Ivanis is forced to retire."

kub.1000.t: "Raising 'Frederica' From Tsemes Bay"
kub.1000.d: "In 1926, with Ukrainian help, we began to raise the ships of the Black Sea Fleet, sunk in the Tsemes Bay in 1918 by the Bolsheviks. By the demand of the Brest Peace Treaty, the fleet was to be handed over to Germany, but the sailors preferred to sink the ships.\n\nSince then several ships have been raised, many of which have been dismantled for scrap metal. Only a few ships were successfully raised and restored: the destroyers Kaliakria and Kerch, the tanker Elbrus, and the transport ship Generosa. \n\nDespite the setbacks, the government is still trying to raise the remaining ships from the bottom, although each time the hope that at least some of them can be recovered diminishes. The lifting of the Frederica, also a transport ship, has finally taken place."
kub.1000.a: "Unfortunately, it can't be repaired..."

kub.1001.t: "Rada Debate Ends in Deadlock"
kub.1001.d: "With the Black Monday crushing our economy, the solution to the crisis was raised in the Rada. However, the opposition could not agree with Chernomortsy on the main solutions. We must quickly do something to revive our economy, otherwise we will find ourselves in the state of civil war."
kub.1001.a: "Ataman should intervene."
kub.1001.b: "Accept Lineitsy's amendments for the sake of stability!"

kub.1004.t: "Vasil Ivanis Retires!"
kub.1004.d: "Unable to resolve the political crisis in the Republic, the Ataman of the Cossack Host and our formal head of state, Vasil Ivanis, has announced his retirement. He sees it as an only way out of the policial crisis.\n\nHe also announced his intention to dissolve the Rada and schedule new elections for September. The new government and parliament will have to solve all the pressing problems and appoint a new Ataman. In addition, Ivanis noted that he plans to become one of the candidates for ataman, and that his resignation is temporary and only a pretext to stabilize the situation.\n\nAt the same time, Prime Minister Bych condemned Ataman's decision and urged not to dissolve the Rada at such a crucial time, and called on Rada members to agree on measures to combat the economic crisis."
kub.1004.a: "Who leaves his office in such dire times?"

kub.1005.t: "Dissolving Rada"
kub.1005.d: "Ataman Vasil Ivanis now faced a choice: dissolve the rampaging parliament, unable to make a single adequate decision, or leave it running until the situation stabilizes? It seems that the fate of the entire Republic depended on this decision."
kub.1005.a: "This is too much, we should work until we deal with crisis!"

kub.1006.a: "Worrying."

kub.1007.t: "Battle of Novorossiysk"
kub.1007.d: "Today the Host of Pokrovsky’s loyalists have tried to seize the city of Novorossiysk, but there they were met by the KPA resistance. A battle has started, with similar forces ready to fight to death on both sides. Pokrovsky, however, should decide about the additional forces to defeat the rebels."

kub.1008.t: "Battle of Novorossiysk"
kub.1008.d: "Lineitsy have joined the side of Pokrovsky, and soon the KPA was forced to hide in the mountains and forests of the Novorossiysk Coast, allowing Pokrovsky to invade the city. However, back in Yekaterinodar, the local Cooperatives have openly denounced Pokrovsky’s rule and seized the administrative buildings. There have also been reports, that the local communists are starting to rally peasants and workers against the 'Maikop Butcher'."

kub.1010.d: "We decided to strike early and it was a winning strategy. The Cooperatives have rallied some of the citizens into the remnants of the KPA, but we have quickly destroyed them, robbing the cooperatives by the way.

He demanded that the power in the republic should be in the hands of its people, not a Cossack.\n\nWhile his forces have gained some strength, they are still outnumbered by our host.

kub.1014.t: "Intervene in Kuban?"
kub.1014.d: "The dramatic events are taking place in the Kuban region, where various groups are slaughtering each other for the power. The only loyal force to us in the region, the Lineitsy of the Caucasus Line Cossack Host have asked our government to intervene in the conflict.

kub.1015.t: "[FROM.GetName] Intervenes!"

kub.1024.t: "'Free Borders' Zone with Kuban?"
kub.1024.d: "People from Kuban are often travelling to Ukraine, which is also correct to say about Ukrainians, travelling to Kuban. With the new 'Free Border' agreement the citizens of our countries won't need any additional bureaucracy to go through in order to travel between Kuban and Ukraine."

kub.1027.t: "Ukraine Welcomes Kuban Autonomous Region!"
kub.1027.d: "The Ukrainian government has done everything it should in order to officially recognize us as a part of their country. We have received a good amount of autonomy: at least, the Kuban Rada has stayed, though it is likely that with introduction of Ukrainian parties to the region, the influence of pro-Russian forces will be smaller and smaller.\nMoreover, [KUB.GetLeader] will stay as the leader of our region, but in a role of Governor."
kub.1027.a: "Hooray!"

kub.1028.t: "Ukraine Restores Zaporozhian Host!"
kub.1028.d: "Several centuries have passed since the Zaporozhian Host was forcefully disbanded by the Russian Empire. Now, with the establishement of the Free Cossack Society - Vilne Kozatstvo, the Ukrainian government has suggested to restore the host in its original lands in the Zaporozhian region of Ukraine.\nAs our people are direct ancestors of the Zaporozhian Cossacks, much of the Kuban Cossacks are ready to move to their homeland to build up the new Host."
kub.1028.a: "Historical justice has been served!"

kub.1029.t: "Ukraine Invests in Our Navy"
kub.1029.d: "The leadership of the Ukrainian Navy, in addition to joint exercises, also insisted that the government provide investment for the development of the Kuban Black Sea Fleet in Novorossiysk.

kub.1031.a: "Luka Bych wins the mandate!"
kub.1031.b: "Nikolai Ryabovol's faction emerges victorous."

kub.1032.t: "Scouts of Kuban"
kub.1032.d: "In 1914 Erast Platonovich Tsytonovich, a teacher and tutor of Tsarskoye Selo children, became interested in the idea of scouting and joined the newly founded society for the promotion of boys scouts \"Russian Scout\" on September 24. During World War I the Tsarskoye Selo detachment of young scouts (scouts) was headed by Tsytovich.\nAt one of the conventions of His Imperial Majesty's Retinue, Tsytovich said: \"Let us hope ... that the star of scouting lit over Russian youth will burst into bright light throughout the vast expanse of our dear Motherland and that hundreds of thousands of Russian boys and girls will respond to the call: 'Be ready!' with an orderly, cheerful and cheerful response: 'Always ready!'\"\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Civil War, Tsytovich found himself in Kuban as a teacher. From 1918 he became a member of the Kuban government, and from May 5, 1919, until the very end of the First Republic, he served as Minister of National Education. \n\nAs early as September 1918 Erast Tsytovich set up a Commission for Scouting in the Ministry of Education, and in October - courses for instructors in scouting, as well as a series of lectures to the heads and teachers of educational institutions, then for young people and the general public. \nThe result was not long in coming. A month later, two Boy Scout troops and one Girl Scout troop were formed in Yekaterinodar. Erast Platonovich paid great attention to raising and strengthening the Cossack spirit. He made several changes, taking into account the specifics of the Scout Movement in the Cossack region: he introduced the old Cossack term \"gromada\" (community) in the life of scouts, introduced the highest title - \"Ataman Scout\", which corresponded to the English \"Royal Scout\". Under him a new name of the squad appeared - Gromada of Kuban Scouts.\n\nThanks to him, the Scout Movement in Kuban developed by leaps and bounds, and now Tzytovich is asking the government for approval of subsidies and the introduction of scouting in all schools of Kuban."
kub.1032.a: "Fund his movement!"
kub.1032.b: "The Scout movement is fine without additional help."

kub.1033.t: "Commemorating Oleksi Kulabukhov"
kub.1033.d: "Today the Chernomortsy initiated a memorial meeting in memory of Oleksi Kulabukhov, a Cossack public figure, whose life was cut short on November 7, 1919.\n\nThe graduate of Stavropol Theological Seminary, after the revolution life itself has put him on a field of public activity. He enjoyed the confidence of his Novopokrovsky Stanichniks and was their permanent representative in the Kuban Rada. A highly cultured and active man, he especially did not want to remain idle after the Cossacks were threatened by Bolshevik domination. At the most alarming time, when the Kuban Minister of Internal Affairs Bardizh gave up his post and left to form the \"Free Cossacks\" detachments, the Rada appointed Kulabukhov to take his place. \n\nIn a difficult climate of political uncertainty, the new minister for a long time managed to keep a relative calm in the Kuban, which attracted thousands of people fleeing the war and repression of the new government to Yekaterinodar and the villages. On March 1, 1918 priest Kulabukhov left Yekaterinodar together with the retreating \"Rada Detachment\", but was captured by the Red Guards in the village of Rasshevatskaya. He managed to escape from them and hide until the Second Kuban Campaign in Stavropol\n\nLater he returned to his former position as head of internal affairs in the Bych Cabinet. In December 1918 this government, disagreeing with the policy of Kornilov, resigned, and Kulabukhov was appointed a representative at the Caucasian Conference. Kulabukhov, together with other Kuban representatives processed and signed the draft Treaty of Friendship with the Mountain Republic. In September, 1919 the delegation sent him to report to the Rada about its activity and with the offer to approve the draft treaty. However, Kornilov's supporters found in the agreement of Kuban with the Mountain Republic a dangerous violation of the authority of the ruler of Southern Russia. The members of the delegation were accused of treason, of transferring the command of the Cossack troops into the hands of the Mountain Mejilis and of other crimes. Kulabukhov was arrested. The military field court sentenced him to execution by hanging, which was immediately carried out on November 7, 1919."
kub.1033.a: "Hero of Kuban..."

kub.1034.t: "Fyodor Shcherbina Passes Away"

kub.1035.t: "Cooperation Struggles"
kub.1035.d: "With the economic crisis reaching our nation, the prices were forced up by the local producers. The consumer cooperatives have struggled most of all - forced to sell products at lower prices, a lot went bankrupt. On the other hand, the agricultural, labour and credit cooperatives have to deal with great inflation and general recession of demand. The situation worsens each day."
kub.1035.a: "A great blow to the cooperative movement!"

kub.1036.t: "De-Cossackisation Policy Provokes Unrest"
kub.1036.d: "The policy of De-Cossackisation, initiated by [ROOT.GetLeader] has provoked large unrest among the population. In fact, the situation is so dire, that any moment we can find ourselves in a state of anarchy and civil war. The opposition inside the Revolutionary Committee also grows, as our minister of internal affairs, Aleksey Avtonomov calls for delay of the repressive policies against the nation. While he has some supporters behind him, our Chairman is sure that the unrest will be dealt with using rifles and machine guns."
kub.1036.a: "Avtonomov ousts Poluyan!"
kub.1036.b: "Avtonomov is arrested for treason!"

kub.1037.t: "Lineitsy Elected in Kuban"
kub.1037.d: "The 'Lineitsy' faction gained majority at the recent elections to the parliament of the Kuban People's Republic. The Lineitsy, or the Caucasus Line Cossacks are the faction that is looking forward general alliance with Don Cossacks and Russia, though aiming to secure Kuban sovereignity as independent nation.\nThe opposition has criticized the elections, claiming that they were held with violations."
kub.1037.a: "Will Kuban turn to Russia?"

kub.1038.t: "Chernomortsy Elected in Kuban"
kub.1038.d: "The 'Chernomortsy' faction gained majority at the recent elections to the parliament of the Kuban People's Republic. The Chernomortsy, or the Black Sea Cossacks are the faction that is looking forward joining Ukraine in a federal union, or at least greatly strengthening ties with [UKR.GetName].\nThe opposition has criticized the elections, claiming that they were held with violations."
kub.1038.a: "Will Kuban finally join Ukraine?"

kub.1039.t: "Military Coup in Kuban"
kub.1039.d: "The Black Monday crisis and couple of unpopular decisions of the former government has led to a coup, initiated by a Kuban Cossack Viktor Pokrovsky, notoriously known for 'Maikop Massacre'. In defence of Kuban freedom, the leader of Kuban Insurgent Army, Vasil Ryabokon has successfully counter-couped Pokrovsky and now has consolidated his power.\nRyabokon is likely to restore Kuban Rada soon, as he did in 1925, however there are some rumors that his time Ryabokon won't trust the politicians and will announce martial law for the sake of order and stability."
kub.1039.a: "Will Ryabokon restore order?"

kub.1040.t: "Soviet Coup in Kuban"
kub.1040.d: "The Black Monday crisis and couple of unpopular decisions of the former government has led to a coup, initiated by a Kuban Cossack Viktor Pokrovsky, notoriously known for 'Maikop Massacre'. In defence of Kuban freedom, the leader of Kuban Insurgent Army, Vasil Ryabokon has led a counter-uprising, but failed. With Pokrovsky’s radicals initiating repressions, the Revolution was sparkled in Yekaterinodar, leading to the rise of Kuban Bolsheviks. The Revolutionary Committee has already secured its power and is now aiming to de-Cossackize Kuban, as a revenge against decades-long oppression of peasants and workers."
kub.1040.a: "Bolshevism is not yet dead."

kub.1041.t: "Chernomortsy Launch a Campaign"
kub.1041.d: "It has come to our knowledge that the Chernomortsy faction in the Rada has launched a large-scale propaganda campaign among the population aimed at increasing public support for accession to Ukraine. With the help of leaflets, public appearances, and rallies, the Chernomortsy are trying to win over the popular sentiment to their side. Large-scale means have been used, and it seems that we have nothing to respond to this yet."
kub.1041.b: "Another pathetic attempt!"

kub.1042.t: "Chernomortsy Lobby Independents"
kub.1042.d: "The Chernomortsy began actively lobbying non-partisan members of the Rada to their side, in particular by seeking their support for a number of controversial bills. Despite the fact that most of the non-partisan members are generally pro-Russian, many of them are bribed by the promises of the Chernomortsy and vote for their bills.\n\nOn the one hand, we can go the extra mile to lure them back to our side, but it still bears little comparison to the opportunities of wealthy Chernomortsy. On the other hand, we can remember the names of these traitors who put their comfort above the interests of Kuban."
kub.1042.a: "Make an additional effort to retain non-partisans"
kub.1042.b: "We will remember their treason."

kub.1043.t: "A Business Leader Ally Chernomortsy"
kub.1043.d: "One of Kuban's wealthy businessmen declared his support for the Chernomortsy faction and the movement for unification with Ukraine. He expressed confidence that cooperation with the Ukrainian government and business would bring Kuban a lot of investment and social development, and in the case of accession, this possibility increases many times over.\n\nThis businessman is quite famous among the locals and enjoys unquestionable authority, which will undoubtedly incline the electorate in favor of the candidates from Chernomortsy.\n\nOn our part, we can prepare an additional budget to tilt him toward Kuban's independence, but our already small capacity will hardly make it effective."
kub.1043.a: "Prepare our funds to make him change sides."
kub.1043.b: "We shall work better next time."

kub.1044.t: "Lineitsy Launch a Campaign"
kub.1044.d: "It has come to our knowledge that the Lineitsy faction in the Rada has launched a large-scale propaganda campaign among the population aimed at increasing public support for Kuban self-statehood and the benefits of an alliance with Russia.

kub.1045.d: "Today a large rally was held in Stavropolye, where representatives of the Lineitsy spoke. Their speeches were printed in the newspapers and quickly spread to other regions, drawing the interest of the population. In their speeches, the Lineitsy argue why it is not beneficial for Kuban to become part of Ukraine and how much it would hurt the interests of ordinary Kuban residents and cooperatives. Their hypocritical speech about cooperatives caused protests of the Kubsoyuz on the one hand, and support of Yuskvet on the other hand. \n\nFor our part, we feel that we have to respond to them and organize our own rally, but it will require additional monetary investment."
kub.1045.a: "Outline the benefits of joining Ukraine!"

However, after dinner, which lasted until late in the evening, Ryabovol volunteered to escort his acquaintance home.\n\nIn the street, he was caught by the killer. After firing two headshots, the murderer managed to flee by car, while the Ataman of Kuban died instantly.\n\nThe news of Ataman's murder provoked an unequivocal reaction in society - for everyone it was a signal that Kuban is still far from being stable, and for the Chernomortsy the loss of the long-time leader of the Unification movement was a terrible event. The Rada declared a week-long mourning period, and also decided to close all the newspapers that were harassing the deceased. An investigation has begun, but few doubt that radicals close to Pokrovsky's clique were behind the murder."

kub.1050.t: "Restoration of the Rada"
kub.1050.d: "The nation is slowly returning to the order and stability, and the leader of KPA, [ROOT.GetLeader], has announced that soon the Kuban Rada will restore its work. The main issue for the current regime is however to find a reliable provisional Ataman to lead the nation. One ones suppose that Ryabokon should himself become the Ataman and leader of Rada, the others suggest to hand the office to a civilian politician."
kub.1050.a: "Ryabokon will be a decent leader."
kub.1050.b: "Our democratic tradition is saved!"

kub.1051.t: "The New Face of Chernomortsy"

He was the first head of the Kuban government in 1917-1918 and is known for his rather leftist views. After the fall of Kuban People's Republic in 1919, he moved to Austria, where he taught municipal law in the Ukrainian Agricultural Academy and was its vice principal. After the restoration of the Republic by Ryabokon's KPA in 1925, he willingly returned back and became one of the ministers in Ivanis's cabinet. Now, Bych became at most the only popular candidate that can be elected as Kuban Ataman. With his ascension, the programme of Chernomortsy is expected to take a steady turn to the left."

kub.1055.t: "The Communist Party"
kub.1055.d: "The Revolutionary Committee of the Kuban-Black Sea Soviet Republic was in power since the Revolution in [234.GetName], but it really lacked serious structure and any openness to masses. That is why [ROOT.GetLeader] has today announced that we should become open to workers and peasants of Kuban and establish our own party - and enter the world stage as a new socialist republic. While some conservatives in the government believe that we are not a truly independent nation and that our region belongs to Russia only, they have suggested to rename ourselves into a Kuban Regional Committee of the Russian Communist Party. The others, however, suggest that as we are far from joining socialist Russia at this moment, it would be wise to establish our own Communist Party until we will re-unite with Motherland."

kub.1056.d.nationalization: "$kub.1056.d.intro$\n\nWhile Ukraine has also a history of cooperative movement, it is now in the past, as our government took all necessary steps to nationalize the cooperatives or make their lives hard enough to announce bankrupcy. With the Kuban cooperatives being larger and more widespread, it will take time to get rid of all of them."
kub.1056.d: "$kub.1056.d.intro$\n\nWhile Ukraine has also a history of cooperative movement, it developed differently, which have now significantly increased the pressure on state capacity of cooperative economy. Without any control, the Kuban cooperatives will close or be forced to announce bankrupcy if we don't help them."
kub.1056.a: "We have no other choice, but to nationalize Kuban cooperatives."
kub.1056.b: "That's quite unexpected."

kub.1057.t: "Economic Disparities"
kub.1057.d: "Economic disparities between the Peasant and Cossack populations of Kuban have been simmering for some time. The Peasants, who comprise the vast majority of the population, feel marginalized and excluded from the economic benefits of Kuban's prosperity. This divide could threaten the stability of the region. If not addressed, it could lead to unrest and violence."
kub.1057.a: "Address the issue by holding a public meeting with peasant leaders and listening to their concerns."

kub.1058.t: "Reaching Out to the Cossacks"
kub.1058.d: "To bridge the divide between the Cossack and Peasant communities, [GetRulingParty] proposes a plan to increase peasant representation in local government and create more economic opportunities for them. However, some Cossack leaders see this as a threat to their political power and are resistant to the idea.\n\nIn fact, the vast majority of the Rada is against the plan, as they are looking forward to safeguarding the current regime of a 'Cossack Republic'."
kub.1058.a: "Push ahead with the plan, even if it means facing opposition from Cossack leaders."
kub.1058.b: "Abandon the plan and look for alternative ways to ease the economic disparities between the two communities."

kub.1059.t: "Peasant Uprising"
kub.1059.t: "Despite attempts to address the economic disparities, the peasants have grown increasingly frustrated with the slow pace of change and the continued dominance of the Cossacks. This frustration has boiled over into violence, and a Peasant uprising has occurred in several towns across Kuban. With the main center of uprising being in Stavropolye, the region mostly dominated by the Socialist-Revolutionaries since the beginning of the century, the situation is rapidly spinning out of control."
kub.1059.a: "Deploy Cossack forces to quell the uprising."
kub.1059.b: "Open channels of communication with the Peasant leaders and negotiate a peaceful solution."

kub.1060.t: "Cossack Retaliation"
kub.1060.d: "The Cossacks respond to the Peasant uprising with retaliatory violence, and the situation quickly devolves into a full-scale conflict between the two communities. The Kuban cooperative economy is heavily impacted as the region becomes increasingly unstable."
kub.1060.a: "Put an end to violence and reestablish order!"

kub.1061.t: "Reconciliation"
kub.1061.d: "With the violence subsided, Kuban is in a state of fragile peace. To prevent further conflicts, [GetRulingParty] has proposed a plan to increase economic opportunities for Peasants and foster greater cooperation between the two communities. This plan is met with skepticism but gains traction over time as both sides begin working towards a more peaceful and prosperous future together."
kub.1061.a: "The conflict has ended... most likely."

kub.1062.t: "Kuban Asks For Military Aid"
kub.1062.d: "The Kuban government has asked us for military aid, as they are frightened by the possible invasion of their country."
kub.1062.a: "Reject their demand!"
kub.1062.b: "We must support them."

kub.1063.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
kub.1063.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to send us military aid in case of any war!"
kub.1063.a: "Ridiculuous!"

kub.1064.t: "German Military Aid Arrives!"
kub.1064.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has sent us military aid in order to help us in our independence!"
kub.1064.a: "The Germans are really a valuable ally."

kub.1065.t: "Kuban Asks For Protection"
kub.1065.d: "The Kuban government has asked us for a protectorate as they fear possible invasion of their land."
kub.1065.a: "We will provide - but at a cost."
kub.1065.b: "We are those invaders of our rightful land!"

kub.1066.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused!"
kub.1066.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has refused to protect us!"
kub.1066.a: "Relying on Russia - never heard anything funnier."

kub.1067.t: "Russian Offer"
kub.1067.d: "The Russians have agreed to protect us, but at a cost - they demand us to join their nation as an autonomous subject. However, some of the local leaders are afraid that this 'autonomous status' will end as soon as Russia borders us."
kub.1067.a: "That's quite a strange attempt to subdue us."
kub.1067.b: "We have no choice!"

kub.1068.t: "Occupation of Kuban"
kub.1068.d: "Despite our promises, our government views Kuban only as a part of Russia without such a wide autonomy. The plan is to demand immediate subjugation of Kuban, dissolution of any 'Radas' they have and swearing of allegiance to the Great Russia!"
kub.1068.a: "Demand subjugation!"

kub.1069.t: "Russia Threatens Us With Annexation"
kub.1069.d: "Despite their promises, the Russian government hungrily views our rich soils and lands and demands our immediate subjugaton, dissolution of the Rada and complete loyalty to them."
kub.1069.a: "Kuban shall never subjugate!"

kub.1070.t: "Cossack Resistance"
kub.1070.d: "Despite our threats, the Cossacks of Kuban have refused our terms and declared their full sovereignity over their lands."
kub.1070.a: "Destroy them!"

kub.1071.t: "Kuban Requests Military Protection"
kub.1071.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has requested military protection and guarantees from us in the upcoming expansionist aggression of Don and Russia."
kub.1071.a: "Provide them with our military protection!"
kub.1071.b: "We won't risk a war with Russia."

kub.1072.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
kub.1072.d: "Despite our efforts and mutual cooperation, Ukraine has refused to ensure our sovereignity by their guarantees, as it fears the possible escalation of conflict with Russia."
kub.1072.a: "Disappointing."

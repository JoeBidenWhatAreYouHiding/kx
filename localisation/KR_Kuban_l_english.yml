### Events ###
kub.1.t:0 "History of the Kuban People's Republic"
kub.1.d:0 "Proclaimed in 1918, Kuban People's Republic was on the right side of the hedge in the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Our stable economic growth, democratic traditions, and intense cooperation made it possible for Kuban to become one of the most successful splinter states of the Russian Empire. Unceasing conflicts between two parliamentary groups, one pro-Ukranian and other pro-Russian, have wracked our politics but have also ensured good relations both with Russia and Reichspact. However, who knows if it is not just a calm before the storm."
kub.1.a:0 "You, Kuban, you're our Motherland!"

kub.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Kuban"
kub.2.d:0 "The Berlin Stock Crisis has reached Kuban as well. With our neighboring Don Republic also feeling their part of the devastation brought on by the disaster, the Germans have begun withdrawing their businesses, investments, and other forms of capital from our nation, further crippling our economy. We are in a free fall, and must act quickly in order to save our nation from total ruin."
kub.2.a:0 "It's a disaster!"

kub.3.t:0 "Ataman Bukretov Found Dead!"
kub.3.d:0 "The recent news reports that the reigning Ataman of the Kuban People's Republic, Nikolay Bukretov, has suddenly passed away at the age of 60, being found dead in his study early this morning. A new provisional government has been formed to maintain order for now and elections should be held soon to determine the future of the nation."
kub.3.a:0 "Glory to Ataman!"

kub.4.t:0 "Elections of the New Ataman"
kub.4.d:0 "After the death of Ataman Bukretov, the Regional Rada has decided to vote on a new ataman. The Cossack Circle, consisting of the supreme Cossack leaders of the various hosts, have convened to appoint the new Ataman. There are two candidates, one from each major faction of the Rada: Vasiliy Ivanis, supported by pro-Ukrainian Chernomortsy, and Aleksandr Filimonov, supported by pro-Russian Lineitsy." 
kub.4.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

kub.5.t:0 "New Ataman Elected"
kub.5.d:0 "The last of the campaign stops have ended and the race is over, and the Cossack Circle is finally ready to announce who they have chosen to appoint as the new Ataman, elected by the Regional Rada and the Cossack Circle after weeks of deliberation and debate."
kub.5.a:0 "Ivanis is the new Ataman.Glory to the pro-Ukraniane Chernomortsy!"
kub.5.b:0 "Filimonov is the new Ataman. Glory to the pro-Russian Lineitsy!"

kub.6.t:0 "1936 Kuban Elections"
kub.6.d:0 "This year in the elections there are two political forces participating: the Chernomortsy, who are allied with Ukraine, and Lineitsy, who are allied with Russia. The result will depend on the popularity of the parties amongst the citizens and their comparative power in the Regional Rada."
kub.6.a:0 "Let us wait for the result."

kub.60.t:0 "Chernomortsy Victorious!"
kub.60.d:0 "Due to their popular campaign and effective propaganda, the Ukrainian speaking, Reichspakt-aligned Chernomortsy party of the Black Sea Host has gained the majority of votes."
kub.60.a:0 "Congratulations."

kub.61.t:0 "Lineitsy Victorious!"
kub.61.d:0 "Due to their popular campaigns and effective propaganda, the Lineitsy faction has gained the majority of votes. Their pro-Russian agenda will now come to dominate our politics."


kub.7.t:0 "Start the Spring Session"
kub.7.d:0 "The New Year Holidays are over and it is time to start the annual Kuban Regional Rada session.\nAs usual, the main debates are between the plans of the Lineitsy delegates and the Chernomortsy factions. This time, we shall discuss the direction of the economy and the possibility of new army reform, while also attempting to iron out several smaller internal issues our regime is currently dealing with."
kub.7.a:0 "Exciting!"

kub.8.t:0 "Nikolay Ryabovol Opening Speech"
kub.8.d:0 "Nikolay Ryabovol, one of the leaders of the Chernomortsy faction, has spoken today in the Regional Rada, demanding further cooperation with Mitteleuropa. He emphasizes cooperation with Germany in particular as a means to protect against Russian aggression but also seeks to work closely with the Ukranians.\nAs the question of Kuban's foreign policy still remains unsolved, the topic of becoming a member of the German sphere of influence is a fast growing to be another hot debate between the deputies."
kub.8.a:0 "Chernomortsy trying to draw us away from Russia."

kub.9.t:0 "Filimonov's Address to the Nation"
kub.9.d:0 "Aleksandr Filimonov has presented the Lineitsy's 1936 National Budget, which includes amendments that call for fierce cooperation with Russian government. While many claim that Filimonov's speech is a criticizing response to Ryabovol's Ukrainophile plan, the idea of returning back to Russia is a popular idea amongst many Kuban citizens."
kub.9.a:0 "Chernomortsy and Lineitsy argue as usual."

kub.10.t:0 "The Upcoming Elections"
kub.10.d:0 "This year also brings with it the new legislative regional elections, with an active political campaign of both Chernomortsy and Lineitsy. Currently, Chernomortsy hold the majority in the parliament, having 32 seats out of 60 in the Regional Rada and Luka Bych being the current prime minister and chairman of Rada.\nThis will be a challenge for Lineitsy to get the majority, however, they also have plenty of supporters in Kuban to tap into for support."
kub.10.a:0 "Who will win?"

kub.11.t:0 "Direction of the Economy"
kub.11.d:0 "With Ataman Bukretov trying to keep Kuban's neutrality, both factions in the Rada have their own economic plans for Kuban. While the Chernomortsy look forward to cooperating with prosperous economies of Germany and Ukraine, the Lineitsy see our future with Russia and its developing economy. While some predict the very end of the German economy, some hope that the new Russian government will become a vital world economy in the next few years. Do we go with the struggling giant or the possible up and coming power?"
kub.11.a:0 "The Chernomortsy are right - we must cooperate with Germany."
kub.11.b:0 "The Lineitsy are right - Russia has potential."

kub.12.t:0 "Cossack Army"
kub.12.d:0 "The Kuban Cossack Host, consisting of Black Sea and Caucasus Line cossacks hosts needs to be reformed as soon as possible. In the new century, the cavalry tactics of old cannot protect our nation from the tanks and mechanized forces of foreign powers.\nTwo plans are available for us to choose from: turning our forces towards motorized, fast attack tactics, or improving the artillery and support equipment of our army, using superior weaponry to rain down fire upon our foes."
kub.12.a:0 "Motorized Cossack Force!"
kub.12.b:0 "Improve the Artillery."

kub.13.t:0 "Kuban Asks for a Bailout"
kub.13.d:0 "The government of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our problems first, Kuban can be a vital ally in our confrontation with Russia and open the Caucasus to us - and its black gold."
kub.13.a:0 "Help them a bit."
kub.13.b:0 "Promise something, do nothing."
kub.13.c:0 "Who is Kuban?"

kub.14.t:0 "Germany Agreed to Help"
kub.14.d:0 "The German Empire agreed to help us, despite all the instability. This is a great victory for Chernomortsy, indeed, as it opens ways for further cooperation with Mitteleuropa."
kub.14.a:0 "Splendid!"

kub.15.t:0 "Germany Promise to Help"
kub.15.d:0 "Germany promised to help our economy to recover. However, their help is not totally guaranteed. But we can rely on this information and try to get closer to Germany in the future."
kub.15.a:0 "Something, at least."

kub.16.t:0 "Germany Refused to Help"
kub.16.d:0 "German government refused to help us! This is a great disappointment for Chernomortsy and their voters."
kub.16.a:0 "Perhaps we shall work with Russia then?"

kub.17.d:0 "The government of the Kuban People's Republic has asked us for a bailout. While we are currently trying to deal with our own problems first, it can be a first step to peacefully return Kuban into the Motherland."
kub.17.c:0 "We don't negotiate with traitors."

kub.18.t:0 "Russia Agreed to Help"
kub.18.d:0 "Russia agreed to help us, despite all the instability. This is a great victory for Lineitsy, indeed, as it opens ways for further cooperation with Russia."

kub.19.t:0 "Russia Promised to Help"
kub.19.d:0 "Russia promised to help our economy to recover. However, their help is not totally guaranteed. But we can rely on this information and try to get closer to Russia in the future."

kub.20.t:0 "Russia Refused to Help"
kub.20.d:0 "Russian government refused to help us! This is a great disappointment for the Lineitsy and their voters."
kub.20.a:0 "Perhaps we shall work with Germany then?"

kub.21.t:0 "Economy Recovers"
kub.21.d:0 "Thanks to all the measures, our economy has begun to slowly recover from the Berlin Stock Crisis. Though far from over, our recovery is now well on its way. Soon, our economy will be back to its pre-collapse form."
kub.21.a:0 "Amazing!"

kub.22.t:0 "Language Issue"
kub.22.d:0 "Same as parliamentary factions, our nation is split between Ukrainian-speaking and Russian-speaking regions. However, Ukrainian is still not an official language in our country, despite all the efforts made by Chernomortsy. This issue shall be solved this year, and Chernomortsy are already promising to finally solve it."
kub.22.a:0 "A great pre-election promise."

kub.23.t:0 "Circassian Minority"
kub.23.d:0 "The nation, known as Circassians or Adyghe is a muslim minority, that lives in the Adygea and North Caucasus districts in Kuban. While their district have representation in the Regional Rada with North Caucasus having 4 seats and Adygea only 1 seat, they are held by Chernomortsy or Lineitsy deputies. The Circassians de-facto have no representation in the parliament and currently they don't have equal rights with other Kuban citizens. This issue has been a headache since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic, leading to strained relations with the Mountain Republic who recognize Circassia as a part of their state. We shall guarantee equal rights for Circassians in the following convocation of Regional Rada."
kub.23.a:0 "Another issue to deal with."  

kub.24.t:0 "Ukrainian As a Second Language?"
kub.24.d:0 "The issue of the Ukrainian language should finally be solved. Now there are three options for us: recognize Ukrainian language as a second official language in the Kuban, forbid Ukrainian language or keep the status quo. The choice depends on our government’s predispositions, however."
kub.24.a:0 "Make Ukrainian the official language alongside Russian."
kub.24.b:0 "Keep the status quo."
kub.24.c:0 "Forbid the public use of Ukrainian."

kub.25.t:0 "The Peasantry-Cossack Conflict"
kub.25.d:0 "Since the foundation of the Kuban People's Republic, the conflict between cossacks and peasantry has been a major problem. The cossacks, who make up less than half of our nation’s population, own 80% of land and production while local peasantry live in poverty and squalor. When Kuban once again declared its independence in 1925, the situation became much better, with peasants gaining voting rights and their farmland being nationalized under the state and out of greedy corporate hands. However, the policy of Ataman Bukretov led to further oppression of peasants. The Regional Rada should do something about this, either helping peasants and farmers, or finally centralising our state under Cossack rule."
kub.25.a:0 "Favour the peasants."
kub.25.b:0 "Favour the cossacks."

kub.26.t:0 "The Circassian Minority"
kub.26.d:0 "Something should be done with the Circassian issue. We can either grant them autonomy and receive popularity and stability in the region, or let them leave for the Mountain Republic and make Circassia a true cossack land."
kub.26.a:0 "An autonomy for Circassians."
kub.26.b:0 "Exile them to Mountaineers."

kub.27.t:0 "Abkhazia"
kub.27.d:0 "The region of Abkhazia, especially the city of Sochi, is populated by Russians and Ukrainians in a large majority over the ruling Georgians. However, Georgia stole these lands from us when our great state was oppressed under Russia boot of the Tsarist regime of old. Now, we are not too weak or shackled to defend ourselves! We can either demand the return of this land, demand autonomy for Kubans in the region, or keep the status-quo intact."
kub.27.a:0 "Demand Sochi back."
kub.27.b:0 "Demand autonomy for Kubans in Abkhazia."
kub.27.c:0 "Save the status-quo."

kub.28.t:0 "Georgia Accepts."
kub.28.d:0 "Georgia has agreed to return Abkhazia to us without a drop of blood being spilt. This is a great victory for our foreign ministry and for the Kuban people as a whole. Let us celebrate at once!"
kub.28.a:0 "Splendid."

kub.29.t:0 "Georgia Refused."
kub.29.d:0 "Georgia has refused our request to return the region of Abkhazia to our hands. This is a travesty, and a slap in the face to our international prestige. Shall we slink back into our holes or stand strong and meet the Georgian menace on the field of battle?."
kub.29.a:0 "Fight for our lands."
kub.29.b:0 "We are too weak to fight." 

kub.290.t:0 "Peace with Kuban?"
kub.290.d:0 "The Kuban forces have occupied our territory of Abkhazia. We can either sign a peace treaty and end the war, avoiding the spilling of innocent [ROOT.GetAdjective] lives, or we can stand vigilant and defend our borders and their integrity from these cossack aggressors."
kub.290.a:0 "Offer them peace."
kub.290.b:0 "We will never surrender."

kub.291.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers Peace"
kub.291.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] offered us peace and Abkhazia. Our military might has scared them into offering up the territory we claim before any serious amount of lives are thrown away in needless conflict. What shall be our response?"
kub.291.a:0 "Accept the treaty, Abkhazia was always the goal."
kub.291.b:0 "We shall destroy [FROM.GetName]."

kub.292.t:0 "Peace over Abkhazia?"
kub.292.d:0 "We were unable to occupy Abkhazia. We must send a peace delegation to stop this aimless war. Hopefully we can prevent further needless bloodshed."
kub.292.a:0 "Send the delegation at once!"


kub.293.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Offers Peace"
kub.293.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetName] offered us peace, seeing that their war with us truly is futile. We will show them the futility of their mistake by raising our flag above their capital instead. No one spills [ROOT.GetAdjective] lives and gets away with it."
kub.293.b:0 "We shall destroy these cossacks."

kub.30.t:0 "Reforming the Regional Rada"
kub.30.d:0 "While the traditional system of Kuban Regional Rada has been keeping our nation together with Chernomortsy and Lineitsy counterbalancing each other, we should adapt a more democratic and more pro-Russian system of State Duma: a regular parliament with open elections. The Regional Rada will be disbanded and the State Duma should appear instead."
kub.30.a:0 "Let's do this."


kub.100.t:0 "The Savior Is Here"
kub.100.d:0 "Today, the armed cossack forces of general Viktor Pokrovskiy have rushed into the Ataman's residence in Yekaterinodar and arrested Bukretov. Soon after, Pokrovskiy proclaimed himself the new Ataman of the Republic and dissolved the Rada. Due to the incompetence of the former government, especially in its failure of its duties to protect people, as Pokrovskiy argued, his duty is to save his Motherland and its people from chaos and anarchy."
kub.100.a:0 "The Savior will protect us."

kub.101.t:0 "Dissolve the Kuban Regional Rada"
kub.101.d:0 "The Rada has for long been a hurdle to the true goals and needs of the Kuban people, with its deputies sitting there for over a decade, doing nothing but arguing and growing more fat and decadent. The Rada should be immediately dissolved. Those who are not with us, are against us. Only the firm hand of our new Ataman will help us to overcome the crisis."
kub.101.a:0 "Close this talking shop."

kub.102.t:0 "Ban Ukrainian Parties"
kub.102.d:0 "Several Ukrainian parties, including USDRP and UPSF which closely cooperated with Chernomortsy faction, should have nothing to do within our nation’s politics. They had no chance to sustain their democracy in Ukraine and it is stupid to think they can here succeed in a foreign country. We must ban these groups at once to stop the foul taint of the Ukranians from sullying our state."
kub.102.a:0 "Kuban for Kubans"

kub.103.t:0 "Ban Ukrainian Language"
kub.103.d:0 "For too long, the influence of our large Ukranian minority has been spreading throughout the Kuban republic. Since the first Chernomortsy party programme, where they stated that the Kuban region should be a part of Ukraine, this plague has wrought its toll on our people. We should ban speaking Ukrainian in public places and in official meetings, and ban teaching Ukrainian at schools and universities."
kub.103.a:0 "Worth enough to save the nation."

kub.104.t:0 "Traitors Everywhere!"
kub.104.d:0 "Kuban is being dissolved into parts, being ripped apart piecemeal by various vulturous groups. Whoever they are - Ukrainians, Circassians, Chechens, Kalmyks - they all want their piece of a pie, lying in wait, ready to strike when we are most vulnerable. In response to this, as the Savior has decreed, we will consolidate our grip over all of Kuban and destroy every last enemy of the state that threatens our unity."
kub.104.a:0 "Everything for the state!"



kub.200.t:0 "The Don-Kuban Union?"
kub.200.d:0 "The peoples of Don and Kuban are ethnically, culturally and politically one people in all senses of the word, with only insignificant borders dividing us. We should end this era of separation and humiliation, and finally proclaim the United Don-Kuban republic, a republic for all cossacks between the Black and Caspian seas!"
kub.200.a:0 "Send the offer to the Don Republic"

kub.201.t:0 "The Don-Kuban Union?"
kub.201.d:0 "The government of the Don-Kuban Union has offered to join them in a union. While our nations can be similar in a variety of facts, our political interests can differ greatly."
kub.201.a:0 "Accept their offer - the Cossacks shall be united."
kub.201.b:0 "Nonsense! We will never agree to such a silly proposal."

kub.202.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Agreed!"
kub.202.d:0 "The Don government agreed to sign the Union treaty. We shall march hand in hand under the banner of a united Don-Kuban Union! Finally, peace and unity has reached the land between two seas."
kub.202.a:0 "Lyubo, bratsy, lyubo!"

kub.203.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused!"
kub.203.d:0 "The Don government refused to sign the Union treaty. Those traitorous dogs do not know what they are missing, and now our union shall be left to die unless we draw blood. We can either crush these fools and reinstate the great Don-Kuban Union by force, or let the idea fade into the dustbin of history."
kub.203.a:0 "We shall crush these traitors!"
kub.203.b:0 "War will only tear us apart, abandon the idea."

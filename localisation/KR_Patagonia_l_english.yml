### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ANTONIO_SOTO_DESC:0 "Antonio Soto Canalejo was born in 1897 in the city of Ferrol, La Coruña province, Spain. His father died when he was very young, and he was forced to move to Argentina with his brother when he was just thirteen years old. Already as a teenager, he was exposed to the anarchist ideals by the people he met while he travelled with the 'Serrano-Mendoza' travelling theatre company. He participated in a strike of trade employees in Trelew, Chubut province, that turned into an open rebellion, with him fighting alongside the strikers. Although the revolt was crushed, he gained valuable experience for his future uprising.\n\nWhen the Second Patagonic Strike came about, after wealthy landlords decided to ignore the requests that had been agreed between the strikers and the government, he decided to join up with the strikers and organize their insurrection. The strike led up to a stand-off at the 'La Anita' farm, where Soto rallied the disillusioned workers with a fiery speech and managed to hold back an army detachment lead by Lieutenant Colonel Varela. His forces began growing with simple workers who wanted better working conditions and eager idealists alike, slowly but steadily managing to drive the army to a stalemate until the affair became public and the government called off the military. 'El Gallego' has become a legendary figure for the workers in the FOP and anarchists worldwide, and having allied with Emilio Lopez Arango in order to secure the stability of the USA, much is expected from the chairman for the following years..."
POLITICS_MANUEL_BALDOMERO_DESC:0 "Born to a wealthy family, he attended the 'Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires', where he became an avid reader and enthusiast writer. In 1897, he travelled to Paris in order to continue his studies. He assisted Philosophy and Sociology courses and began following Jean Jaurés after the US's intervention of Cuba in 1894, where he began manifesting his hatred towards imperialism. He joined up a group of young writers in Argentina and they all affiliated the Partido Socialista. However, the Partido Socialista's conservative leadership by Juan B. Justo quickly antagonized the young group, which formed its own more combative faction within the PS.\n\nWhen the FOP broke off, Ugarte couldn't stand Juan B. Justo's inaction, and decided to leave towards the newly-born nation. While Ugarte has shown devotion to the revolutionary ideals, he also has many differences with his fellow revolutionaries. He staunchly defends freedom of religion and the concept of nations, reaffirming his love for the Argentinean nation and culture. However, he also believes in joining forces with other socialists in order to stop imperialism into South America, and as such, he'll strive to unite South America under his banner."
POLITICS_KING_OF_MAPUCHES_DESC:0 "Jacques Antoine Bernard, better known by his regal name 'Antoine III' was born in 1880 in París, France. A French nobleman, who inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucania and Patagonia from his father, who rules over a population that is rather apathetic to him. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since then. The people he rules are as foreign to him as he is to them, which makes his legitimacy doubtful at best."
POLITICS_VARELA_PATA_DESC:0 "Héctor Benigno Varela was responsible for suppressing the Patagonic Strikes during the 20's. During his first encounter with the strikers, he was lenient and allowed them to continue, considering the strikers were right in reclaiming better rights from their employers. However, during the Second Patagonic Strike, his ruthlessness shined through, as he demanded the strikers to surrender unconditionally, even executing the messengers Soto sent to reach an agreement. However, he failed to contain the uprising, and his failure gained him a demotion in the army. However, since then he has worked closely with the Liga Patriotica, gaining valuable experience in anti-insurgency tactics, and now that he's military governor of the Patagonia, he will rule with an iron fist and hunt down those who once dared to humiliate him"
POLITICS_JACQUES_ANTOINE_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Jacques Antoine Bernard was born in 1880 in París, France. A French nobleman, he inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucania and Patagonia from his father. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since and as a result. As a result, the republican Brazilian government, though willing to press his claim to Patagonia to ensure its Argentine rival remains divided into the future, forced Bernard to accept a republican form of government, albeit with power firmly concentrated in his person."
POLITICS_RODOLFO_GHIOLDI_DESC:0 "Rodolfo Jose Ghioldi began his career in the Argentinean Communist party right as it formed in 1917, being elected as the vice-president Federación de Juventudes Socialistas. He worked as a teacher the following years as the revolution in Russia waned, and once the events of the Semana Tragica and the Patagonia Rebelde occurred, he was laid off from his work during the following red scare due to his political views. Seeing little purpose in staying in his home city of Buenos Aires, Ghioldi pulled strings in the Communist Party to be sent to Patagonia with his brothers Americó and Orestes. After his arrival, factional disputes between the Party and the Anarchists led the leader of the party, Luis Emilio Recabarren, to eventually commit suicide. With the help of Moisés Isaakovich Kantor, Ghioldi was quickly able to campaign and become the leader of the Communist Party, leading it from 1924 onwards with the help of his brother Orestes. The compromising nature of Ghioldi was able to help defuse the tensions between Anarchists and Communists in Patagonia, helping both coordinate their efforts against their common enemy in Argentina, but while this has made him a respectable figure among moderate circles and the opposition, the radicals within the Party have been quick to accuse Ghioldi of favouring other parties' interests above theirs."
POLITICS_ALFREDO_PALACIOS_DESC:0 "Alfredo Lorenzo Ramón Palacios has long since been a symbol of the growth of moderate socialism in Argentina. Known as the 'Lawyer of the Poor' for accepting to act as lawyer in cases where his clients, usually working class members, could not afford his services without charging them, Alfredo became the first Socialist deputy in Argentina by earning the votes of the workers of the Immigrant-dominated neighbour of La Boca. As deputy, he continuously pushed for pro-labour legislation, but due to the complicated Argentinean political landscape or his own personal convictions, he was never able to finish any of his mandates as deputy. Having being kicked out of the Socialist party in 1915 for accepting to duel another politician (an act that was forbidden by the party), he worked mostly as Professor in the Universidad de Buenos Aires until he became headmaster of the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. Unlike the Baldomeristas in the Socialist Party, Palacios silently opposed the Patagonian revolution, choosing instead to campaign for change within the system until the Christmas Coup forced Palacios to go into hiding. Resurfacing after the Patagonian victory, Alfredo was quickly able to utilize his political clout to earn his candidacy to General Secretary, and now, he stands as the leader of the Argentinean nation. An idealist man, Palacios seeks to follow Juan B. Justo's dream, and so he'll seek to restore the Argentinean Republic as it was before the revolution, before continuing to reform it into being a workers' paradise."
POLITICS_SEVERINO_DI_GIOVANNI_DESC:0 "Severino Di Giovanni arrived in Argentina as a young adult refugee from the Italian Civil War, in one of the many waves of Italian immigrants that arrived in the nation over the last few decades. Settling in the town of Morón, he began working in the anarchist newspaper La Antorcha before the events of the Patagonic Strikes led him to flee to the South. Once in Patagonia, he settled in Puerto Madryn and began working on his own newspaper, called the 'Culmine'(Culminate), where he attempted to coordinate the southern anarchists not just against the reactionaries in the north, but against those who he deemed as pseudo-revolutionary political parties aiming to manipulate the revolution just to gain extra votes. As the war with the north dragged on, he rose quickly within the ranks of the USA, and his role as a challenging voice against Soto and Arango quickly came to a head. Now that he stands as the new Chairman, Severino has an even more radicalized version of a Workers' Utopia than any other faction dares to conceive, and it remains uncertain whether the USA will continue to support him as thoroughly as it has so far if his ideas and the idea of pragmatically rebuilt Argentina collide."
POLITICS_LIBORIO_JUSTO_DESC:0 "The son of the Argentinean General Agustin P. Justo, 'Quebracho' was raised within a military background as his father worked as headmaster of the El Palomar Military Academy, allowing Justo to spend time with whom, ironically, he'd end up fighting against during the revolution. While generally shielded by his father from the anti socialist regimes that kept appearing in Argentina, Liborio decided to embark on a personal crusade southwards, first touring through the vast expanses of Patagonia to mingle with the rural peasantry, and later to fully join the revolutionary movement as an asset, having prepared for it bringing as many books as he could muster from his father's collection in El Palomar. Quickly, he became one of the most important assets for the Communist militias trying to face off the Argentinean Army, and while far from being as skilful as his father, he proved to be a decent field commander. This, paired with his firebrand advocacy for South American revolution and the overall overthrow of Capitalism, quickly allowed him to rise in relevance in the Communist party, and while he originally lacked the political clout to beat Ghioldi, Liborio eventually got his chance to shine in the coup against the government. Now standing as chairman, Liborio has even publicly stated that he sees himself as a 'Messiah of the Latin American Revolution', and that the Argentinean revolution is just the first step towards a bigger plan..."

### Starting Tree ###
FOP_the_revolutionary_fires:0 "The Revolutionary Fires"
FOP_the_revolutionary_fires_desc:0 "Despite the attempts of the Argentinean government to quell the flames of revolution, our movement is still alive, and growing stronger by the day. While our victory is far from certain, we must start preparing for the final showdown against the reactionaries in the north."

FOP_the_three_main_issues:0 "The Three Economic Issues"
FOP_the_three_main_issues_desc:0 "The Patagonian landscape has not been easy on our movement. We will need to be smart if we wish to prevail on the battlefield, and to prepare ourselves for it, we must first survey the issues that plague our local economy."

FOP_we_need_more_production:0 "Arms Smuggling"
FOP_we_need_more_production_desc:0 "Our first step towards a Patagonian industrial revolution is to give ourselves the means to defend our revolutionary state from the reactionaries to the north. As we even lack the means to set up an industrial base, however, we'll need to look abroad for whatever weapons our meagre resources can get us."

FOP_adapt_the_fishing_industry:0 "The Patagonian Fishing Industry"
FOP_adapt_the_fishing_industry_desc:0 "The sizeable Atlantic fishing industry in Patagonia was effectively shuttered by the revolution. Before we can build a build a navy to defend our coasts, we must first help our fishermen reclaim the seas and restore Patagonia's mothballed merchant fleet. Above all else, this will help us feed both our people and our army."

FOP_prospect_for_resources:0 "Exploiting Resources"
FOP_prospect_for_resources_desc:0 "The Patagonian economy is grievously underdeveloped with many of the region's riches being left trapped beneath the earth. There is no reason for this other than the neglect of the previous regime and now that we're in control of our own fate we'll have to jump-start a resource industry to support both our people and our revolutionary army."

FOP_grandes_trabajos_de_progreso:0 "Industrial Planning Scheme"
FOP_grandes_trabajos_de_progreso_desc:0 "The old regime left Patagonia in a state of abject destitution, lacking any semblance of modern industry. Patagonia's own industrial revolution will have the ultimate goal of bringing prosperity to our people, but before we can fulfil it we'll need to establish the supply chains needed to fuel it from abroad."

FOP_where_we_gonna_build:0 "Central Construction Agency"
FOP_where_we_gonna_build_desc:0 "Abandoning the exploitation and whims of the free market, we'll set up a central planning committee in Puerto Madryn to oversee future developments in the region. By setting clear goals for ourselves and our workers, we'll be able to create the basic industry and infrastructure that Patagonia needs more efficiently."

FOP_fund_north_patagonia:0 "Divert Funds to Chubut"
FOP_fund_north_patagonia_desc:0 "The Northern Region of Patagonia, Chubut, has become the heart of the revolution, but it is far from being the muscle capable of carrying out our revolution. By diverting funds to the region, the Central Construction Agency hopes to be able to set up development areas for future industry."

FOP_fund_south_patagonia:0 "Divert Funds to Santa Cruz"
FOP_fund_south_patagonia_desc:0 "The Southern Region of Patagonia, Santa Cruz, has been largely a backwater region of Argentina, with barely a few fishing towns and a few mines worth noting. By diverting funds to it, the Central Construction Agency hopes to make the region catch up with Chubut in terms of development so that it may hopefully become less of a weight, and more of a supporting province for our efforts."

FOP_factory1:0 "Patagonia's Industrial Revolution"
FOP_factory1_desc:0 "Through the great efforts of our labourers the goal of turning Patagonia into a fully modern industrialized state is finally within reach. It won't be long now until we've gone from being one of Argentina's poorest regions to having our very own industrial revolution!"

FOP_military1:0 "Military Autarky"
FOP_military1_desc:0 "Gone are the days of relying solely on the kindness of our comrades. Through our toil and dedication, we're close to achieving self-sufficiency. With a steady stream of guns being produced by Patagonian hands for our war effort, we'll be better prepared to defend ourselves than ever before."

FOP_further_boat_conversions:0 "Expand the Fishing Fleet"
FOP_further_boat_conversions_desc:0 "Our fleet is currently able to meet the bare basics of our people's needs. It's a start, but if we devoted more of our resources towards expanding our fleet we'll be able to truly enjoy the riches that the oceans can offer us."

FOP_chilean_naval_assistance:0 "Chilean Naval Assistance"
FOP_chilean_naval_assistance_desc:0 "Our comrades in Santiago have aided us with soldiers, guns and resources since the dawn of our revolution. In exchange for some future concessions down the line, they'll be willing to send some of their naval engineers our way to expand one of our minor ports to house a shipbuilding facility as well."

FOP_request_syndie_countries_ship_designs:0 "Request International Navy Assistance"
FOP_request_syndie_countries_ship_designs_desc:0 "With a coast guard in place to protect our coast, we now need to look for a means of striking at the jugular of our enemies. If our allies prove willing to provide us with a handful of their older submarine models, we should be able to wage a guerrilla war beneath the seas if any dare to attack us!"

FOP_request_syndie_subs:0 "Request International Submarines"
FOP_request_syndie_subs_desc:0 "Forts and land warfare can only get us so far. If we wish to strike against our enemies, we will need to request old submarines from our allies. Even if they can only spare a few relics from the Weltkrieg, it would go a long way to safeguard our coastline from hostile forces."

FOP_syndie_support:0 "International Officer Training"
FOP_syndie_support_desc:0 "Most of our navy is currently commanded by a mix of the captains of converted civilian vessels and inexperienced civilians voted into a commanding position. If we could convince the Third International to help us train our officers, it could prove invaluable in our efforts to strengthen our navy."

FOP_coastal_defences:0 "Coastal Defences"
FOP_coastal_defences_desc:0 "Should our coast guard be forced back into port or sunk, our cities will be completely exposed to naval landings by the reactionaries. To prevent them from employing such cowardly tactics against us, we must build defensive fortifications along our coast."

FOP_the_population_issue:0 "Population Surveys"
FOP_the_population_issue_desc:0 "In order to properly prepare for the incoming war, we need to carry out a census of our population, and begin drafting conscription lists, as we will need to dig our claws deep for every reserve soldier we can send to the front."

FOP_rally_the_people:0 "Rally the Workers!"
FOP_rally_the_people_desc:0 "The Frente Obrero's Cause is just! The workers of the north would be wise to see this, and while their voices are kept quiet by the northern regime, we can still reach them via our informants and hidden transmissions. We will help them reach our lines so that they can help us overthrow the regime that dared oppress them."

FOP_increase_conscription:0 "Women at Arms"
FOP_increase_conscription_desc:0 "Our adversaries to the north have held down the women of Argentina for far too long. Therefore, we'll give a rifle to every woman that's willing to serve in our army in the spirit of equality and actively encourage more to do so. While some petty traditionalists may disagree with this measure it'll help greatly to even out the odds against Buenos Aires."

FOP_mass_army:0 "Mass Recruitment Scheme"
FOP_mass_army_desc:0 "In order to make up the difference in manpower we need to bring as many people as possible into our ranks. We'll set up recruitment offices across our revolutionary state and send out officers throughout the countryside to encourage people to volunteer for our cause. While the hasted efforts may degrade our army's quality slightly, it'll effectively solve our manpower crisis."

FOP_mass_training_methods:0 "Improvised Weaponry"
FOP_mass_training_methods_desc:0 "Just like we had to cut some corners to make up the difference in manpower between us and Buenos Aires, we need to do the same for our equipment. We'll set up a series of workshops in the countryside and use Patagonian ingenuity to turn common civilian utilities into deadly weapons of wars. A makeshift weapon is better than an empty hand!"

FOP_more_is_needed:0 "Encourage the Unwilling"
FOP_more_is_needed_desc:0 "Our enemies gravely outnumber us and to make up for this weakness we'll need to encourage the unwilling to do what's right and take up arms against the enemy. While this move will disrupt Patagonian society, it's better than to end up as slaves under the reactionaries."

FOP_imports_from_chile:0 "Chilean Military Aid"
FOP_imports_from_chile_desc:0 "As we stand on the precipice of war, our comrades on the other side of the Andes have informed us that they're ready to step up their military aid to us. This will go a long way towards equipping our fledgling revolutionary army with proper guns."

FOP_internationale_guns:0 "Internationale Guns"
FOP_internationale_guns_desc:0 "Our comrades in Chile can only provide us with so much. In order to make sure every soldier has a rifle and enough ammunition to make up for the superior numbers of the counter-revolutionaries, we'll need to look abroad for help. Thankfully, our comrades in Paris and London will be able to provide us with what we need in the spirit of red solidarity."

FOP_indiscriminate_conscription:0 "Indiscriminate Conscription"
FOP_indiscriminate_conscription_desc:0 "In order to solve our manpower shortages we may be forced to expand the size and scope of our conscription efforts. Every man and woman need to do their duty for the revolution. Even if the quality of our army will suffer until we win the war due to the influx of unfit soldiers into the ranks, an unfit soldier is better than no soldier at all."

FOP_call_on_chilean_manpower:0 "Call for Chilean Volunteers"
FOP_call_on_chilean_manpower_desc:0 "Many of our comrades across the Andes are eager to spread the revolution and fight for their country, but are unable to enlist and fight in the Chilean army. We need to get the message to as many of them as possible that there's a ration, rifle and an opportunity to spread the revolution on our side of the border."

FOP_call_on_european_help:0 "Call for European Manpower"
FOP_call_on_european_help_desc:0 "Even if we gave a rifle to every man and woman in Patagonia we'd still be outnumbered. To match our enemies, we must call on our comrades in Europe to help bolster our ranks. Luckily for us, the cradle of the world revolution is full to the brim with revolutionaries that are eager to help the socialist cause. All we need to do is to put out the word and help them reach our shores."

FOP_international_army:0 "International Force"
FOP_international_army_desc:0 "There are untold thousands of aspiring and veteran revolutionaries across the world that are ready, willing and able to enlist with us. We only need to spread the message and aid as many of them as possible to join us. While this will lead to some coordination issues between our soldiers, it'll make sure our ranks are full."

FOP_international_officers:0 "International Air Volunteers"
FOP_international_officers_desc:0 "While the idea of a Patagonian air force is presently unrealistic, our increased contacts with foreign revolutionaries has allowed us to reach out to experienced pilots around the world ready to turn the skies red. While these daredevils can only provide their own planes, having them on our side will deny the capitalists the uncontested skies they're expecting!"

FOP_manpower_issue_solved:0 "An End to the Manpower Crisis"
FOP_manpower_issue_solved_desc:0 "Desperate times have indeed called for desperate measures but thanks to our efforts we now boast a force that can stand up to the oppressors in the north. When the foe comes to try and take our freedom away we're finally ready to fight them with a fully manned revolutionary army!"

FOP_man_the_border:0 "Fortify the Border"
FOP_man_the_border_desc:0 "With the enemy's superiority in numbers and equipment a defensive stance is not out of the question. By dotting our front line with fortifications and trenches we'll make sure that our former oppressors will pay a heavy price for every inch of Patagonian soil they try to steal from our liberated workers!"

FOP_new_infantry_equ:0 "Infiltrating the North"
FOP_new_infantry_equ_desc:0 "Fighting the enemy on their terms will be the death of us. Instead, we'll destroy our foe by fighting unconventionally and forcing them to meet us on our terms, not theirs."

FOP_organise_the_troops:0 "European Way of War"
FOP_organise_the_troops_desc:0 "Most of our fighters are militiamen and guerrillas without any formal military backgrounds. While more than capable of defending our country, some of our European comrades are offering to help us organize our divisions according to a more regular model. Integrating more of these veterans to train our militias will also help us improve their overall efficiency as well."

FOP_mountain_professionals:0 "Strike the Railroads"
FOP_mountain_professionals_desc:0 "Argentina is a vast land of mountains and rivers. This forces the enemy to rely heavily on railroads to move their forces through the country. If we could prepare a series of railroad sabotages, we should be able to temporarily cripple their mobility in the first crucial weeks of the war."

FOP_infiltration_time:0 "Infiltrator Cells"
FOP_infiltration_time_desc:0 "Argentina is a vast land of mountains and rivers. This forces the enemy to spread their forces throughout the country. If we could infiltrate and sow the seeds of rebellion, we should be able to temporarily tie up their resources in the first crucial weeks of the war."

FOP_armored_mechanized_research:0 "International Armour Specialists"
FOP_armored_mechanized_research_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg proved the effectiveness of tanks in modern breakthrough operations. For our revolutionary armed forces to fully transition into a modern army, it's necessary for us to develop a mechanized branch. By soliciting help from British and French engineers, we should be able to speed up this process significantly."

FOP_military_research:0 "Standardizing Our Tactics"
FOP_military_research_desc:0 "The very decentralized nature of our forces has led to a situation where each squad has its own tactics and methods, and sometimes they aren't even that organized. While unpredictability has its advantages, we should at least standardize our army tactics to the point where our officers can at least predict what moves their comrades can be expected to make."

FOP_army_drills:0 "Veteran Instructors"
FOP_army_drills_desc:0 "Since our revolutionary army mostly consists of volunteer militias drawn from local population, their quality is severely inconsistent from regiment to regiment. By carefully picking out and embedding some of our more more capable and experienced experienced veterans with our fresh  recruits we'll be able to even out their performance and better preserve the army's institutional knowledge."

FOP_new_training_methods:0 "Unconventional Supply Networks"
FOP_new_training_methods_desc:0 "The way we fight means that our revolutionary soldiers often find themselves outside of anything resembling a conventional supply chain. By setting up forward supply caches ahead of advances and training our fighters to better forage for supplies behind enemy lines, we'll vastly improve our overall supply situation."

FOP_military_research2:0 "Foreign Doctrine Assistance"
FOP_military_research2_desc:0 "As our army gains experience, our tactics are also improving. However, now that we're starting to move away from the basics, we need to start defining what shape our grand strategy should take, and we should look to the Internationale for help in this matter."

FOP_organised_force:0 "Mandatory Militia Training"
FOP_organised_force_desc:0 "The constant threat from counter-revolutionaries in Buenos Aires and beyond is forcing us to mandate that our citizens undergo a basic militia training regimen. By preparing our people both physically and mentally for future conflicts, they can be turned into combat-worthy soldiers far more efficiently once their service to the revolution is needed the most."

FOP_national_defence:0 "A Militarized Society"
FOP_national_defence_desc:0 "There can be no permanent peace with the counter-revolutionaries and to safeguard our revolution we'll need to militarize our society for the inevitably conflicts that lie ahead. With a citizenry that's prepared and ready for war, anyone foolish enough to wage war against our lands will be met with fierce resistance from every layer of society."

FOP_The_revolution_succesful_desc:0 "Against all odds, we stand triumphant. Our country may be rubble, and our people may need to adapt to this for a time. But let's not forget that it was us workers who got this country up and running, and as such, we shall do so again!"
FOP_first_national_TUC:0 "The First National Trade Union Congress"
FOP_first_national_TUC_desc:0 "Coming from a tradition of Republican democracy, Argentina had never had a Trade Union Congress up to this point, and while many are anxious to see this historical events, many are wary of it being simply a masquerade for a dictatorial regime. As the gates to the old Congress open to the Union delegates, the fate of the nation hangs in the balance..."

FOP_the_anarchist_radicals_desc:0 "With Severino di Giovanni now serving as the acting chairman, the Anarchist Radicals of the USA have come out on top of the other factions decisively. With a very harsh stance on religion, inequality and nationalism, the Anarchists will attempt to sweep whatever remained from the old Argentina away, and make the Argentinean territory a nation for all workers of the world."
FOP_Equal_Roles_for_Men_and_Women:0 "Female Rights Debate"
FOP_Equal_Roles_for_Men_and_Women_desc:0 "With the conservative regimes trying to keep women as separate from men for a long time, the coming of more liberal regimes over the years changed the outlook for many of them, leading to the creation of many feminist organizations and the inclusion of women in many areas like cinema with equal status. However, Giovanni wish to take this a step further, and such matter will need to be discussed in the congress..."
FOP_Seize_Church_Property:0 "Confront the Church"
FOP_Seize_Church_Property_desc:0 "Argentina de-facto has never been a secular country, with the church playing the role of a major power broker in politics. However, with the coming of the revolutionary regime, this is clearly at an end. With Severino's men at the ready to prosecute every member of the clergy in Argentina, it is only the congress that stands between them and the complete removal of the church from the nation..."
FOP_Build_a_New_Society:0 "Build a New Society"
FOP_Build_a_New_Society_desc:0 "Now that the Congress' tasks have been completed, Severino has offered to pass a bill severely weakening the Congress, in exchange transferring most of its duties to a Federal council elected by regional councils. While that may reduce our control over the farthest regions of our nation, it will allow the more industrialized sectors to run more smoothly."
FOP_the_anarchist_moderates:0 "The Anarchist Moderates"
FOP_the_anarchist_moderates_desc:0 "With Soto remaining in his post of chairman, the USA remains on top of the other Trade Unions, and is now preparing to carry out sweeping changes to the nation. While ideologically driven, Soto is by far a pragmatist within the revolutionary movement, and he'll seek to compromise the anarchist ideals with the society he now has the duty to rebuild. Only time will tell whether this will be successful..."
FOP_moderate_decentralization:0 "Moderate Decentralization"
FOP_moderate_decentralization_desc:0 "While a compromising man, Soto is still an anarchist, and has therefore ordered for some of the responsibilities of the Congress to be delegated to local and regional councils, only keeping largely essential tasks for the central government. While the balance of power hasn't shifted as dramatically as originally envisioned, it still marks a change from the centralized nature of the Argentinean system."
FOP_War_Anarchism:0 "War Preparations Bill"
FOP_War_Anarchism_desc:0 "While it would be the wish of many anarchists to completely abolish the Congress, the truth is that there are many reactionary regimes glancing at our nation, waiting for a time of weakness to strike. As such, Chairman Giovanni has proposed a War Preparations Bill for the congress, extending his rule and the existence of the Congress indefinitely until 'The times of reactionary aggression are at an end'."
FOP_Root_out_Reactionaries:0 "Root out Reactionaries"
FOP_Root_out_Reactionaries_desc:0 "Our nation cannot be safe from foreign reactionaries if local reactionaries aid them in snuffing out our revolution. We can give these traitors no quarter, and as such, we shall stage a national effort to capture any and all who may threaten our revolution."

FOP_Uruguay_line:0 "The Wisdom of our Veterans"
FOP_Uruguay_line_desc:0 "Perhaps our most valuable resource is the vast number of war veterans throughout our society. Though a lot of them starting to become unfit for the harshness of the front lines, their wealth of knowledge must not go to waste. By assigning more of them to train the next generation of soldiers, we'll increase our training efficiency."

FOP_revolutionary_outpost:0 "Defensive Measures"
FOP_revolutionary_outpost_desc:0 "The revolutionary war taught us to rapidly prepare defenses even with the slimmest resources and material at our disposal. If taught more broadly, these lessons could allow us to improve our fortification construction speed without cutting back on their effectiveness."

FOP_the_workers_militia:0 "Federal Militia Recruitment Drive"
FOP_the_workers_militia_desc:0 "While every region is free to have their own militia, we still require a federal army to fight against the reactionaries. The proposed solution to this by the regional councils is to 'draft' a percentage of their regional militias that will instead fight for us for a period of time agreed on with each council. While it may not provide for the best trained forces, it will certainly give us ideologically driven soldiers."
FOP_Reconciliate_with_the_church:0 "Reconciliate with the Church"

As such, the very image of Argentina stands as a testament to anti Imperialism.

FOP_Integrate_Old_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "While some would argue that integrating parts of the old Republican system in Argentina would be a mistake, the truth is that Argentina had taken a slight pro-Worker turn during the last three decades, only coming to a grinding halt with the Uriburu coup.

FOP_the_religious_issue:0 "The Religious Issue"
FOP_the_religious_issue_desc:0 "While most of the lands of South America are unanimously, or almost entirely so, Catholic, the generations of immigrants from Europe and the native populations all profess different faiths than that of the Spanish, or even our Monarch itself. While a state absolutely cannot lack an official faith to guide it, we should be careful as to not alienate those who live in these lands and call it home, for the realm can ill afford unrest in these troubling times."
FOP_a_legacy_of_survival:0 "A Legacy of Survival"
FOP_a_legacy_of_survival_desc:0 "It is said that the harshest of lands create the hardiest of peoples. While Patagonia never had the wealth of the Incas, our people for centuries fought them back, and the Spaniards afterwards, were kept at bay from out lands thanks to our bravery and hardiness. Not with superior numbers, but by learning and adapting to the changing conditions of warfare. Not only by bravery a people endures, for that we did not lack in the previous century, but with force of arms as well."
FOP_economic_development:0 "Economic Development"
FOP_economic_development_desc:0 "These lands have faced much war and hardship over the last decades, and the situation was further aggravated by years of rule under red brigands and looters. We have a unique chance of not only rekindling the spirit of the nation, but to restore its wealth and standard of living, and go even further beyond into prosperity. However, every journey starts with small steps, and the King and his advisors must deliberate on which paths to take on this road."
FOP_safeguarding_silversmithing:0 "Safeguarding Silversmithing"
FOP_safeguarding_silversmithing_desc:0 "As with most cultural habits of the native peoples of the southern edges of the land, the renowned silversmiths of the Mapuche have been impoverished and oppressed since the conquest of this land. Few remain that know the art, but most of them are old masters, that, if found, can be of immense help to further our efforts to protect the culture and way of life of the peoples of our realm."
FOP_agrarian_reform:0 "Agrarian Reforms"
FOP_agrarian_reform_desc:0 "After the syndicalist brigands overran most of Patagonia, those who owned land and herds found themselves in dire straits. Much of their possessions were 'collectivized', that is, stolen and ran into the ground by socialists who don't know the first thing about the lay of the land. By making sure the lands go back to their rightful owners, not only we right a moral wrong, but we can use their expertise to immensely improve the wealth of the realm, and restore the momentum of the sheep farming boom."
FOP_industrialization:0 "Industrialization"
FOP_industrialization_desc:0 "Never has manufacture taken a hold in these lands, much less large scale factories, as development was impossible under the constant oppression and mismanagement from Buenos Aires. A centralized plan is needed to improve our economic situation and safeguard the future of our state, but even such grand plans often have humble beginnings, and we should start by making basic factories of the most essential goods first and foremost"
FOP_the_old_ways:0 "The Old Ways"
FOP_the_old_ways_desc:0 "Ours is a harsh land, where agriculture is difficult, and fertile land rare, and as such much of our wealth comes from the herds of sheep and the fishing in the coasts of the south. Once booming industries whose wealth attracted immigrants the world over, years of syndicalist mismanagement and violence have kept the land from being developed to its full potential, and still owned by very few."
FOP_a_brave_new_world:0 "Brave New World"
FOP_a_brave_new_world_desc:0 "The relatively barren lands of Patagonia have little to offer for large scale cash crops, but in the modern world, wealth comes not from such methods, nor hunting or fishing, but from the great fires and rising buildings of industry. Our monarch's contacts abroad, coupled with the low labour costs and tax burdens, should be enough to kickstart industrial plants in the major cities of the Kingdom, and bring Patagonia to the 20th century."
FOP_a_new_army:0 "A New Army"
FOP_a_new_army_desc:0 "While our people has a brave warrior tradition, an honourable legacy from times of gallantry, times have changed. Now, in the modern day, the tanks, air planes and machines of war brought to bear can dwarf any effort an unequipped man can pour in the battlefield, as there is little bravery can do to pierce the plating of enemy armour. We need to prepare our soldiers, brave and few as they are, as to ensure that our efficiency is battle is maximized, and out new kingdom is not brought to ruin so soon after its re-establishment"
FOP_the_old_army_ways:0 "Our Army Traditions"
FOP_the_old_army_ways_desc:0 "The greatest defence of the kingdom is its people and its land. Inhospitable to most outsiders, the chilling polar winds, the high mountains and the vast steppes are first and most important line of defence of the tribes, and has been for generations. Our people have defeated the great Spanish and Inca empires in war, by outsmarting the juggernauts, and ferociously countering their so called plans of conquest with daring raids and sabotage operations, in preparation for decisive battles."
FOP_restore_the_Kollellaullin_training:0 "Restore the Kollellaullin Training"
FOP_restore_the_Kollellaullin_training_desc:0 "For centuries a closed guarded secret, the ways of close quarters combat of the Mapuche peoples can be now taught to anyone under the King's service. While the process is ardous, we will ensure that the men enlisted will be more effective in close quarters, and the training will help instil the needed discipline in the limited number of men at our disposal"
FOP_request_french_military_mission:0 "Request French Military Mission"
FOP_request_french_military_mission_desc:0 "Much like Patagonia itself, France found itself occupied by syndicalist brigands who sought to destroy the nation, its culture and its faiths. Many of the righteously outraged officers moved elsewhere, becoming exiles in either Algiers or across the courts of Europe and the palaces of the Americas, or adventurers in the Far East. By formally establishing posts to recruit officers and attract technical and planning personnel, we can ensure the realm has an up to date military that is capable of defending the nation for the dangers abroad, while also making diplomatic inroads with the French exiles as a whole."
FOP_a_new_cavalry:0 "A New Cavalry"
FOP_a_new_cavalry_desc:0 "The great plains and steppes of Patagonia are suitable for the training and raising of horses, but also for their continuous use in battle. In these places where no road was ever imagined crossing, the great machines find themselves at a disadvantage, but luckily for the King and his allies, our horsemen not only will know the lay of the land, but receive training to perform in even the harshest climatic conditions, so the riders of the south can once again prove their worth in combat."
FOP_the_status_of_mapuche_culture:0 "The Status of Mapuche Culture"
FOP_the_status_of_mapuche_culture_desc:0 "Decades of persecution damage a culture in many ways. Some are visible, like the abandoned villages, the stolen artefacts, but others, more subtle, such as the loss of oral tradition, knowledge, and language. All of which were almost ruined by the occupation by the Castilian forces; they not only held the local culture in the lowest regard, but actively persecuted it, as they saw the brave natives as a threat to their rule. Now, with the crown's authority protecting the people, the culture of the Mapuche can properly be recorded for future generations to come."
FOP_summon_a_native_congress:0 "Summon a Native Congress"
FOP_summon_a_native_congress_desc:0 "In order to establish a proper ruling body for the Kingdom as a whole, we need not only Mapuche representatives, but ones from all tribes under the protection of the crown, great and small. With the envoys of all the tribes, peoples and organizations gathered, we will form a Royal Council which will help His Majesty while he adjusts himself to his new country, by taking on several administrative tasks and roles for him."
FOP_trading_tradition:0 "A Trading Tradition"
FOP_trading_tradition_desc:0 "As the communities in the area now ruled by the Kingdom of Patagonia were traditionally small, trade was needed to maintain the flow of needed goods between the small realms of tribes that encompassed it. While times have certainly changed, the strategic position of the Kingdom at the very edge of the world is once again an advantage, as the constant turmoil across the North Atlantic increases shipping traffic in the far south, putting our realm and its ports in a uniquely strategic position we'd be foolish not to take advantage of."
FOP_demand_repatriation_of_Mapuche_artifacts:0 "Demand Repatriation of Mapuche Artefacts"
FOP_demand_repatriation_of_Mapuche_artifacts_desc:0 "The poverty imposed by the cruel measures of the occupying colonizers drove many chiefs and holy men and women to sell their most prized possessions to be able to simply eat. Silverware, weapons, art; all taken away to be shown as some curiosity to arrogant men in Buenos Aires. Thankfully, His Majesty knows that requesting these artefacts back is a trivial matter, considering the current situation and proper subjugation of the former oppressors."
FOP_port_expansion_for_natives:0 "Port Expansion for Natives"
FOP_port_expansion_for_natives_desc:0 "While for a long time the ports of Patagonia were designed by immigrants, for immigrants, now the time arrived to make sure the riches of the sea belong to Patagonia's people. While much was damaged, even more destroyed, in the wars that ravaged the land, we will rebuild and persevere, as the folk living in the former land of giants become giants in their own right, riding above the tempestuous waves of the southern Atlantic."
FOP_king_personality_cult:0 "Royal Personality Cult"
FOP_king_personality_cult_desc:0 "The figure of our king is not one widely known about the local populace, not only due to his limited grasp of the language, but because much of his work to restore the kingdom was done behind the scenes. As such, his lifelong struggle for Patagonia often passed as a quest for personal ambition rather than duty and selflessness. Even when he was mocked and derided by foreign courts and press, when he had to almost ruin himself travelling abroad to gather support, or how he even now moved to a land he never saw, to fulfil the oaths of his predecessors. As we establish more and more schools in both Spanish and native languages, we cannot neglect the need to remind the people of the great live and cause of Antonie, King of Patagonia."
FOP_basic_military_production:0 "Basic Military Production"
FOP_basic_military_production_desc:0 "While we have many allies abroad that can supply us with weapons in times of need, the fact is that the nation remains at permanent risk, until we have at least a minimum degree of self sufficiency in our weapons manufacturing. While truthfully, the numbers wont be high, the numbers of our small and elite military are also not, and as such, we predict that even small plants can supply our forces locally to perform at an optimal level."
FOP_proclaim_the_king_as_permanent_toqui:0 "Proclaim the King as Permanent Toqui"
FOP_proclaim_the_king_as_permanent_toqui_desc:0 "While traditionally, the role of Toqui was one of the military commander in chief, elected by the tribes in times of war, the Crown is now the main guardian and defender of the peoples of the region, and such, is the de facto toqui, perhaps the greatest of them in history. By solidifying the powers and roles of the monarch with primarily native than foreign titles, we can ensure that even our government itself is safeguarding the lifestyle and culture of the native peoples."
FOP_legacy_of_Toki_Leftraru:0 "Legacy of Toki Leftraru"
FOP_legacy_of_Toki_Leftraru_desc:0 "Every nation has a hero, a founding figure of chivalry, honour and ideals that stands the test of time. The greatest of all Toquis, the man known to the Europeans as Lautaro, fought the greatest and most powerful empire in human history and won, while leading the Mapuche people to victory on key engagements, not simply mere ambushes. His work uniting the tribes, and laying the foundations upon which our monarchs later would build upon, cannot, and should never be, forgotten by those who now reap the fruits of his labour"
FOP_status_of_kindred_natives:0 "Status of Kindred Native Tribes"
FOP_status_of_kindred_natives_desc:0 "While considered the main native group of Patagonia, the Mapuche are not the only natives of Patagonia. The Chewel Che, who lived here in the far south even before the Mapuche, are a broad group of locals which inhabit western Patagonia, and they have suffered even more than the Mapuche themselves during the occupation. However, their very name is an exonym, a Mapuche word for 'hardy people', and they will endure, but now, they have their native kin to help defend and guard their rightful lands"
FOP_diplomatic_connections:0 "Diplomatic Connections"
FOP_diplomatic_connections_desc:0 "Our King, while in his lifelong exile, spent much of his time making friends in high and low places across the courts and palaces in both sides of the Atlantic. Even more important, news of our people's plight, which only grew under the rule of the bandits of the Worker's Front, has garnered great amounts of good will among foreigners, and such, our struggle to rebuild the nation will find many ready allies across the world."

This lead to unrest throughout the nation, but especially in the south of the country, in Patagonia. Extremely poor working conditions brought the rise of Socialism and Syndicalism, with thousands of people refusing to work and rioting through the streets. The British forced the Argentine government to intervene, turning riots into rebellion during the events that led to the Semana Tragica. The situation only escalated further and further from there, with the LP growing in strength in the main cities, particularly with the Buenos Aires City Oligarchy. However, deep in the south of Argentina, a new type of unrest grew. What started as a simple strike of rural workers became a general strike in the south, demanding for the payment of wages that had been due for months and the improvement of working conditions. While an agreement was reached at first with the creation of the 'First Rural Agreement of the Patagonia', when the land owners didn't keep their promises, the workers started another general strike, forcing an armed retaliation by an expedition lead by Lieutenant Colonel Hector Benigno Varela. The workers, trusting Varela after he had helped create the first agreement, would try to negotiate with the officer, only to be met with a dreadful realization: Varela was there to demand nothing more than unconditional surrender of the strikers, and he was willing to shoot all who opposed to keep control of the Patagonia."

fopintro.2.t:0 "The Patagonia Rebelde"
fopintro.2.d:0 "The workers, rallied behind the figure of Antonio Soto and Jose 'Facon Grande' Font, decided that the time for revolution was now. Despite the disarmament clause in the original Rural Agreement, most of Soto's anarchists had left their weapons to Alfredo 'El Toscano' Fonte, after he and many other more radical 'anarchists' refused the agreement, and so Soto found himself having to ally with the Patagonian bandit in order to get the equipment to arm the workers to fight. After the initial victories of the Army, the workers dealt a decisive victory at La Anita farm, and with the coordination of the FORA through telegraph lines and message runners, the Second Great Patagonic Strike only grew and grew in strength, with the Argentinian army being unable to deal with it without sparking heavy political backlash in the capital for the popular UCR in power."

fopintro.3.t:0 "The Contemporary Frente Obrero Patagonico"
fopintro.3.d:0 "Many years later, the fires of the revolution continue to burn in Patagonia. Chile had to step in and protect the FOP from the north, and so holds much sway in how the nation is run. Antonio Soto, leader of FORA and one of the main participants in the revolution, has lead the nation ever since, leading a loose and fragile coalition of Anarchists, Communists and Radical Socialists. Due to political instability, proper elections have not been held yet, however Soto has promised to step down from his position once the crisis with Argentina ends, whatever the result may be. There are worries that the election won't take place in time, for due to the rise of Carlés in the north, people fear that an invasion will happen soon. However, with the Patagonic Strike being seen as the beacon of anarchism and socialism by many, international support both by the Internationale and by willing anarchists and exiled Bolsheviks alike is not in short supply, and so the workers that may appear to be stranded in such an apparent desolate wasteland like Patagonia may still stand a chance..."

fop.6.t:0 "The Hannaford Idea"
fop.6.d:0 "Guillermo Mac Hannaford, an ex-army major of the Argentinian military, has been condemned for a lifetime of prison for seemingly betraying the reactionary Argentinian Military and leaking official documents to Paraguay and Chile. Luckily for us, insiders in the Argentinian military have indicated that he'll be transported to the Prisión Regional del Sur, a high security prison in the territory of Neuquén, which conveniently sits less than a few hundred kilometres from our border. \n\nUnexpectedly, many of the different factions of our military have jumped at the chance of presenting plans to recover this would-be revolutionary from the reactionary grasp. While some of them are insanely optimistic, the ones that have stood out the most have been a proposal by Buenaventura Durruti's 'Avengers', which suggests utilizing a militia attack as a distraction in the Viedma Area to act as a diversion of a full-scale breakthrough into the prison. In stark opposition of this plan, comrade Iosif Dzugashvili, in his experience, has suggested we pick a smaller team to infiltrate the area, with a couple columns on standby to assist in case the situation escalates, and instead rescue the officer. Dzhugashvili may be across the planet in his hold in Tbilisi, but this ally of the World Revolution still seeks to aid us in our revolutionary endeavors, and his advice is certainly appreciated given his background in these matters. The last proposal to be seriously considered, thrown in by Marc Augier, is to simply send a column in the prison's general direction, and let the officers in charge deal with whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nEach plan carries its own risk for us, unfortunately. While Durruti and Dzugashvili's experience as bank robbers and terrorists in Spain and Russia give them some pedigree in this kind of covert operations, there's no denying we can't exactly commit all the resources they ask of us. By contrast, while the Augier plan is less reliable on paper as the column may just collapse and scatter, it's certainly helping us commit less assets to what's essentially a non-priority target. What should the Revolutionary Committee favour?"

fop.9.t:0 "Major Mission Failure"
fop.9.d:0 "The mission failed massively, while they were able to escape the prison with Hannaford they were misdirected on their return. This allowed a nearby garrison to pincer our troops between them and the prison garrison with Hannaford dying and most of our troops being lost in the escape. This defeat will surely impact the morale of our troops, and it puts a dent on our leadership's reputation."
fop.9.a:0 "Damn."

fop.10.t:0 "Hannaford is Refusing to Help"
fop.10.d:0 "We successfully got Hannaford out of prison alive, but there is still a problem. He is currently refusing to aid our revolution. Hannaford himself, at least according to the intelligence we could gather on his imprisonment, was accused of spying for Paraguay but such accusation had little evidence to support the case, leading some of our command to speculate that he was being framed by a rival in the Army. With that in mind, we believe we can take advantage of the administrative chaos in the North for our agents to dig up information that may help him see things our way. Perhaps, if we show him the truth of the matter, he'll join our side..."

fop.11.d:0 "Our Agents were able to get information on Hannaford's case via army informants, and have managed to uncover a seeming conspiracy to remove Hannaford from command in the Army, with the tacit approval of many members of the GOU. By all means, this move seems to be an undercover form of a purge, and it's hard to assess if many other officers have suffered unfair demotions or imprisonment in the same way Hannaford has. With that information, we have compiled a file and given it to Hannaford, who, while taking his time to take it all in with some level of disbelief, has finally accepted to work with our government. In return he has requested that our agents in Buenos Aires arrange for the transfer of his family to our territory."

While the communists have been using these methods since before the war even began, this has caused friction with the other factions.

Patagonia has been historically a largely undeveloped steppe with occasional rural villages and fishing towns. The 'Three Economic Issues', as dubbed by the ruling Cabinet are:\n\n-A lack of naval infrastructure to both trade and oppose the Argentinian navy in any significant capacity.\n-A lack of basic resources and resource infrastructure. This means that, even if there are some limited reserves of iron and coal in our territory, we both lack the infrastructure to refine it into steel, as well as having an underwhelming infrastructure for its transport.\n-A lack of industry. This one has become the most apparent, as we now rely on Chile for practically everything except for the most immediate supplies like food and water. We will need to solve this, not just so that we can further bolster our combined strength but also so that we can stand up for ourselves in the case that Chile has to pull out their support to defend themselves.\n\n If we are to survive against the reactionary government in the north, we will need to undergo drastic change to get the men and materiel needed for the revolution to even survive.

Given our shortage of manpower, the Revolutionary Government has found no better choice than to utilize these mines and camps as provisional punishment for petty crimes against the people or the government. As such, we may have to divert manpower from our armed forces towards development projects if we wish to have any access to resources..."

The first delegation to take the stage was the one of the FORA, advocating that only the leaders of the Liga Patriotica (LP) should be put on trial, arguing the concepts of Obediencia Debida (Due Obedience), which would absolve most military commanders and civil servants from any connections to the regime unless they were direct members of the LP. This proposal, while being incredibly unpopular with the other Congress factions, it's very popular outside of the TUC as many former civil servants had no choice but to join the new regime or be left unemployed in the middle of an economic crisis.\nThe Anarchists were the next to propose a solution to the old regime: Each person, no matter their rank and file, would be put on trial individually for their actions, and, if found guilty, would either spend a considerable time in prison or suffer the ultimate penalty for their crimes against the workers. A naturally popular proposal amongst radicals, Socialist delegates have protested the implications of the proposal, as it would mark the revolutionary movement to be as bloodthirsty and oppressive as the Liga Patriotica itself was against the workers.\nFinally, the CUSC, with support from the Internationale, has proposed for the former members of the regime to be taken to forced labour camps. These camps would allow the convicted to work off their sentences, and possibly avoid the death penalty by providing a useful service to the nation. The proposal seems to be striking a good middle ground, while not as merciful as the Socialist one and not as harsh as the anarchist one, it's drawing moderates from both sides towards it trying to draw a compromise, even if the bill has not exactly clarified how long would the sentences be, or how the conditions or locations of the camps would be.

However, with the success of our revolution, the different trade union delegations disagree on what path to follow going forward.\n\nThe FORA, for their part, propose that no change should be held, and that the territories considered for provinces, like Santa Cruz and Chubut in the South, should be turned into provinces along with the remaining territories. By contrast, the CUSC has said that the system should be changed, in favour of a centralization of power that puts more emphasis on the Federal Government, somewhat resembling the Unitary proposals that had appeared during the Argentinian Warlord Period. Completely opposed to both proposals, the USA has proposed that the system should be abolished instead and a new one based around popular councils should be formed.

The CUSC, on their end argue that the Constitution should be redrafted, and while some sections of the original could remain, a new one reflecting the new character of Argentina should be created. The USA, unsurprisingly, has opposed to both proposals, and has decided that they'd prefer the nation to simply nullify the existent constitution and move forward without one, instead encouraging individual communes to adopt a constitution if they so desire.

The Argentinean army, long since been divided on the matter of politics, had many who wished for the army to remain apolitical and to reject the political persecution the regime was imposing. Now that we stand as the legitimate government of the nation, these members of the old armed forces could be assets to help us secure our new nation, as well as build up a new army. With some contacts in the army, we were able to establish contact with one of the groups deemed as neutralists: The GOU. While some of the members of the GOU have already been trialed and convicted, some of their members have come off as clean in the trials, and have approached our officials to offer to return to the service. With the help of Agustin P. Justo, Liborio has been able to sway some of the GOU membership to rejoin the regime, provided some benefits are given to the absolved officers. However, word of these meetings and arrangements have come out, and the reception has been poor from the Party, where many see this as the chairman nepotistically replacing the revolutionary leadership for his father's cronies. We can still turn back and reject their offer, but it is unlikely we will be able to get any more qualified officers until El Palomar is up and running again..."

In a meeting with the Bishop of Buenos Aires, Soto has agreed to the Church's demands while keeping the Secular nature of our state, allowing the many Catholic schools and rural missions to continue operating in exchange for the tacit approval of the catholics of the new government. While some clergy members have rejected the results of the meeting, a revolutionary commission will be reassigning these rebellious bishops to reeducation camps, where they shall learn how to coexist with the workers. The only concern remaining is the Vatican's stance on the matter, but given the instability in the Italian peninsula, it is largely believed they will not jeopardize the Argentinean clergy by opposing this newly found compromise."

The idea of the ban had been considered for weeks now, with many detractors on the opposition, but the argument that these practices were remnants of the capitalist means to oppress the working class ended up winning out in the Congress in the end. The ban, while applauded by the anarchist groups, has been extremely poorly received by the public, with many taking to the streets to protest the government's decision to leave thousands of people unemployed, and many hundreds of thousands more without any form of entertainment.

Given the limited numbers and slow reproduction rates of whales, and aiming to protect the Southern right whale as their breeding grounds are huge sources of tourism, the Argentinean government had labelled whales as protected species, yet due to the political instability, it failed to enforce its protections and foreign ships wound up taking advantage of the situation. However, now that the inneffective reactionaries of old are gone, it is on our best interest to keep foreign exploiters away from our nation, and as such, Chairman [FOP.GetLeader] has proposed a bill in which whaling will now be banned in the Argentinean sea, and any ships caught in the act shall be prosecuted. While some conservatives have labelled the measure as extreme, as it now bans all whaling in the region as opposed to just over the protected Southern right whale, the overall public has received the ban positively.

One example of this regards to the teams from the interior, since they had been excluded from the professional cathegories of the Association, favouring instead teams from the Capital and its surrounding area.

The alternative is to launch a full on assault on the Casa Rosada's surroundings, and try to open a way for our men to be evacuated. While Justo thinks it is possible for us to break through, the Command has had to acknowledge that casualties will inevitably be high as the Anarchists still own the Artillery pieces and will likely attempt to do suppression barrages on our forces.

Comrade Justo on his end has proposed for the artillery to support smaller offensives from the Avenida de Mayo, the Avenida Julio Argentino Roca and the Plaza de Armas, all of them from the opposite direction of the Plaza San Martin.

Our officers have submitted two proposals for consideration to deal with the enemy force. The first involves sending our forces across the Parana and taking the fight to the Communists. Scout reports indicate we outnumber them, and by attacking them we may catch them off-guard.

We were then defeated in detail, as each garrison in those towns managed to outnumber, outgun and outmanoeuvre our forces individually, whereas together they might've stood a chance.

Some officers have stated that a retreat would help us last long enough for reinforcements from the south to arrive in strength, but some have rightfully pointed out that if we retreated further, we will lose the capital and we would be forced to surrender. In light of these, it has been suggested our troops take over civilian buildings and use them as improvised blockades, forcing the Communists to sweep house by house in order to move forward.

fopcoup.99.d1:0 "With the Anarchist Forces finally surrendering and Severino di Giovanni being taken in for trial, a power struggle has erupted within the ranks of the CUSC. With Chairman Ghioldi's inaction almost having caused the complete collapse of the revolutionary government to 'Reactionary Agents' and having caused the death of Comrade Tukhachevsky, Justo has raised a successful no-confidence vote within their party, who has withdrawn their support from Ghioldi in the Congress. Having lost all allies and finding no exit, Ghioldi has opted to resign from his position, leaving the decision of who will be the new Chairman to the majority faction in the TUC. With the USA being almost completely delegitimized by Di Giovanni's actions, the CUSC has become undoubtedly the majority faction of the TUC, and with the power vested in them, they have elected as chairman the hero of the recent events, General Liborio Justo, to lead the nation for the foreseeable future. After being sworn into office, Justo gave a stirring speech stating that the Argentinian revolution is only the first step towards the liberation of the proletariat in America from the Imperialists."

fopcoup.99.d2:0 "With reinforcements arriving from the south, the Anarchist columns have been able to advance from Zarate towards Rosario, smashing the Communist forces in their way. By the time they were on the outskirts of the city, the Communist forces had offered their surrender to us. Chairman Giovanni has accepted their surrender, but has passed a bill, with ample support in the Trade Union Congress, to ban the CUSC from holding any seats at all. While this has caused some stir amongst the Communist Party members, their forces have already been decimated, and risking prison, exile or even outright execution for betrayal of the revolution, most have complied to the ban and have quit from the Trade Union and later the party. The new influx of members in the FORA and the USA have now greatly bolstered the power that Giovanni and the USA hold over the nation. With the nation fully under his command, it remains to be seen whether Giovanni's vision of a nation without a government will manage to survive in practice."
fopcoup.99.d3:0 "Having presented the information of Giovanni's planned assassination to Soto and Arango to the Congress, the members of the congress, even those holding seemingly radical seats, have pled guilty on the case and Giovanni will now rot away in the Ushuaia Penitentiary. With this move, the power balance in the USA is now solidly on the moderates side, with the radicals having lost their leader and having their close followers de-legitimized. Now, it is up to Chairman Soto and the USA with a majority of the seats in the Congress to deal with bringing back Argentina from the brink of chaos towards a Socialist Utopia."
fopcoup.99.d4:0 "Facing off against both the USA and the CUSC, Baldomero has come out triumphant and smashed both groups' paramilitaries in Buenos Aires. Ordering the rest of their forces to stand down under the authority of the now consolidated Congress, Baldomero has kept his position of chairman despite the odds. With the CGT and the FORA now as the dominant forces of the TUC, Baldomero stands poised to start the Argentinean reconstruction and see the revolutionary ideals of the Frente Obrero realized, or at least, what he envisioned in the Frente Obrero..."

The Trade Union Congress was convened and the members of the USA outright kicked out from the Congress, with the other unions recognizing the new chairman, whether out of loyalty or out of fear.

The Trade Union Congress was later convened, and the new Chairman has been officially sworn in, with some coercion necessary towards some of the opposing unions.

While many anarchists outside the congress cheer this decision, mass arrests are already been carried out to hunt the enemies of the USA, and the future of the Commune now has become even more uncertain..."

fopking.01.d:0 "During the Conquest of the Desert, the Argentinean Government was eager to attract settlement to the region. Among those who came were Welsh Settlers, who established the community of Y Wladfa in 1865. While they are the most famous, there is also many other european settlements in the region. These settlements are seen as an example of cultural replacement by the Natives, and while these settlements will be allowed to stay for the sake of stability in our kingdom, we will have to decide whether we want to keep encouraging settlers to keep coming to our nation."

fopking.02.d:0 "Prior to colonization, the native Mapuche followed an extensive belief system. Their religion is similar to other native faiths found on the continent, being decentralized and largely centred around myths and spirits. While there have been many efforts to spread christianity into the region, there have always been holdouts of the old ways; in some cases even some merging of old mapuche myths into local legends. As part of our effort to gain support from Mapuche groups, many are calling on the king to recognise the old faith as the official religion in the kingdom. On the other hand there are the King's inner circle of advisors who are deeply influenced by highly catholic integralist teachings, they argue that we must dopt catholicism as our official faith and intensify efforts to spread the faith. Others members of the cabinet have suggested that we take neither side, and allow both groups to coexist and spread in peace in our nation. What should we decide?"

fopfonte.18.d:0 "Today, some of our officers have approached us to discuss Alfredo Fonte. He lead his own forces in helping us rebel against the Argentine government, but he was always very brutal about it. He was the one who triggered the uprising when negotiations were still possible. Since then, there have always been rumours that he has been travelling the country with his band of mercenaries, raiding villages and pillaging homes. It appears these officers are here to confirm these rumours, stating that some of their troops had been raided by a group of bandits lead by Fonte. It would be too bold to just arrest him now, for technically we have not caught him doing anything illegal. Also, he did also help us with the revolution. However, we will keep an eye on him."
fopfonte.18.a:0 "This can't be true..."
fopfonte.19.t:0 "Fonte captured while raiding farmers"
fopfonte.19.d:0 "After recent reports that Alfredo Fonte has been raiding rural villages, we sent troops out to multiple villages to keep an eye out for any raids. Sure enough, after a few weeks, one of our regiments reported back to us, saying they stopped a raid from a band of mercenaries, headed by Alfredo Fonte. If we wanted to now, we could imprison him, or even execute him for his bad deeds. However, we must remember that he was someone who helped us through the revolution, so by imprisoning or killing him we will lose much political support."

However, it appears he didn't even listen to our warning, for he has been caught once again raiding a rural village with his group of bandits. Surely now, it is time to bring an end to his reign of terror."

He has declared that the current government is weak and ineffective, and without his intervention, they would fall quickly to the Argentinians. He has executed many civilians and government officials, and has sent the rest of the government into exile. However, his own government is not secure, as reports of natives entering the capital have been revived. Fonte's government now hands in the balance, as native and bandit alike battle in the streets, fighting for the future of our state. "

fopfonte.22.d:0 "Alfredo Fonte has long been a man of infamy, a dastardly raider to some and a revolutionary anti-hero to others. Growing up in poverty, Fonte learnt from an early age that in order to survive you must take what you wish. And so as he grew older he learnt to despise the oligarchic regimes of Argentina who abused and oppressed his people. In defiance he fought back by raiding government buildings and using violence against the bourgeoisie, accumulating a loyal gang of proletariat bandits and raiders over time. Now in control of Patagonia he has been nicknamed the ''Bandit King'' for his dictatorial enforcement of pillaging and looting of the wealthy and well-off members of society."

fopfonte.23.t:0 "Comrade Fonte Declares the Northern Conquests!"
fopfonte.23.d:0 "Comrade Fonte has addressed his followers by delivering an important speech, declaring the reactionary regimes of South America to be unjust and an immediate threat to the revolution! Since rising to power, Fonte has put in significant resources into training his band of thugs so that they may form a competent fighting force. The culmination of this training appears to be to prepare his army for intense combat with the majority of the nation’s neighbours..."

FOP_Alfredo_Fonte_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1887, somewhere in Toscana, Italy.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Alfredo 'El Toscano' Fonte isn't a military scholar by any stretch. His family moved to Argentina when he was three years old, and since he was a teenager he has dedicated to a life of crime. He lead a gang of anarchist bandits along with Bartolo 'El Paisano' Díaz and Florentino 'Gaucho' Cuello, with whom he raided farmsteads and small villages, attracting other bandits to his gang. During the first Patagonic strike, it was Fonte who sent the formal letter to the government in the name of the strikers, despite only taking part of the strike as an excuse for him to kidnap wealthy landlords and asking hefty sums in exchange for their lives. After the Second Patagonic Strike came about, Fonte met Micaela Feldman de Etchebéhère, who had fled to the Patagonia with his husband, and both proceeded to teach Fonte more refined strategy. Fonte has since then joined forces with Soto, and his experience leading the FOP's troops has made him a fearsome foe.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Fonte has been noted to have a psychotic and ruthless personality, which lowers the overall morale of his troops."

FOP_Paulina_Mansurova_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1915, in the Argentinian Capital, Buenos Aires City.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Born to a family of Russian Bolshevik exiles, Paulina learned from her family the crude reality of the Russian Civil War. Nevertheless, when the FOP formed, she decided to risk her life in order to help the revolution. Despite not having formal military experience, her handling of both Spanish and Russian language have facilitated communication between the military staff and many of the Russian exiles who now reside in the FOP.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- She's known to be in contact with Mikhail Frunze and Mikhail Tukhachevsky, from whom she's currently learning formal military strategy."

FOP_Marc_Augier_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 19, 1908 in Burdeaux, France.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Marc Augier was an enthusiastic alpinist before the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, in which he served in the southern Western front, near the Swiss border. With the French Syndicalist Revolution in full swing, Augier decided to leave towards Argentina, as his primitivist views clashed with the local syndicalist leaders. He has since then helped the FOP's forces with his experience as a soldier and mountaineer, quickly turning him into a celebrity and respected member of the military staff.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- He's known to be in contact with Jacques Doriot, but he has so far refused to return to France, where he thinks his primitivist views will still clash with those of his fellow revolutionaries.\n- Aligned with Ugarte's faction"

FOP_Esteban_Lucich_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1883, in Dubrovnik, Dalmatia, Part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Esteban Lucich lacks any formal military experience, but he has become friends with the illegalist anarchist professor Germán Boris Vladimirovich, who has convinced Lucich to join the FOP's army. Since then, Lucich has proven his strategic talent, although he has proven to be cruel towards his own troops in order to reach his objectives.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Lucich is known to have a psychotic and ruthless personality, which gives him a bad reputation among the FOP's populace and his troops.\n- Aligned with the Radical anarchist faction"
FOP_Micaela_Feldman_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 14 1902, in Moisés Ville, Santa Fe province, Argentina.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Born to a Jewish family that escaped the Tsarist progroms, Mika has taken an active political role since she was 15 years old. In 1923, Mika flees to the FOP with her husband, Hipólito Etchebéhère. She has since then joined the FOP's army, gaining plenty of experience with the constant skirmishes along the border with Argentina.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Aligned with the Communist faction."

FOP_Miguel_Arcangel_Roscigna_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W Circa 1891, in Buenos Aires City, Argentina.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Miguel Arcángel Roscigna, inspired by the assassination of police chief Ramon L. Falcón at the hands of the anarchist Simón Radowitzky in 1909, began taking an interest in anarchism and reading anarchist literature during most of the 1910s, taking part in several anarchist groups. In 1924 he made up his mind and decided to aid Radowitzky and several anarchists to escape from the Ushuaia Penitenciary by signing up as a prison guard there. With the aid of Apolinario Barrera and the chileans Ramón Cifuentes and Ernesto Medina, they were able to organize a successful breakout and reached the FOP just as the Argentinian coastal guard was about to catch up to them. Since then Roscigna has signed up in the FOP's militias and his popularity after the breakout has led him to be chosen to lead by his own troops. However, learning about the events in the Russian Revolution, he has grown wary of the communists in the FOP, and actively works to sideline and hinder their influence.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Close friend of Radowitzky and of Buenaventura Durruti.\n- Aligned with the Radical anarchist faction.\n- Strongly opposed to the Communist Faction."

FOP_Kurt_Gustav_Wilckens_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W November 3 1886, in Bad Bramstedt, Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.\n§YMilitary Career:§W Having studied for most of his youth to become a gardener, economic hardship forced him to enlist in the German Army in 1906 where he was assigned to the Garde Schutzen Bataillons of Prussia. When his mandatory 4 years of service were over, he travelled to the United States to learn more about gardening, and it was there where he learned about anarchism. After taking part in several strikes and industrial sabotages, he was deported back to Germany in 1920. Having learned in the US about the growing anarchist movement in Argentina, he quickly sailed once more towards the new world, arriving at Buenos Aires the 29th of September 1920. He began working in the FAUD sponsored local newspaper 'Der Syndikalist' of the German community until the Great Patagonic strikes came to be. After the initial months of near disbelief at the events, Wilckens decided to join his brothers in the south with Andrés Vázquez Paredes helping in his escape. Despite his extremely pacifist posture, he has decided to join the FOP's militia and his gentleness as well as his conviction has managed to make him rise through the ranks\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Although willing to take up arms for the anarchist ideals, Wilckens despises violence in all of its forms.\n- Aligned with the Moderate Anarchist faction."

FOP_Umberto_Lanciotti_desc:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 1 1894, in Forano, Rieti, Italy.\n§YMilitary Career:§W At the age of 19, Umberto emigrated from Italy to France and then to the United States in order to find work. While in the United States, he went on to a long and prolific career of hopping from one job to the next, accumulating experience in coal mines and refineries, automobile factories, and banks. With the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he ran into issues with the law and went into hiding, finding his way to Detroit where he became an active participant in the anarchist scene of the city. In June of 1920, he served as a waiter aboard the cruise ship Andrea Costa where he secretly returned to Genoa, working alongside the new Socialist Republic to repair the railroads before leaving for England surreptitiously 7 months later. In March of 1925, he then travelled to Buenos Aires and then crossed the Rio Negro to link up with the Anarchist forces there, meeting Severino di Giovanni. His ability to clandestinely move about and terrorize the forces of the reactionary north, along with his fierce loyalty and determination, quickly prompted him to rise up the ranks.\n- Aligned with the Radical Anarchist faction."

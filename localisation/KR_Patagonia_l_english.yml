### Leaders ###
POLITICS_ANTONIO_SOTO_DESC:0 "Antonio Soto Canalejo was born in 1897 in the city of Ferrol, La Coruña province, Spain. His father died when he was very young, and he was forced to move to Argentina with his brother when he was just thirteen years old. Already as a teenager, he was exposed to the anarchist ideals by the people he met while he travelled with the 'Serrano-Mendoza' travelling theatre company. He participated in a strike of trade employees in Trelew, Chubut province, that turned into an open rebellion, with him fighting alongside the strikers. Although the revolt was crushed, he gained valuable experience for his future uprising.\n\nWhen the Second Patagonic Strike came about, after wealthy landlords decided to ignore the requests that had been agreed between the strikers and the government, he decided to join up with the strikers and organize their insurrection. The strike led up to a stand-off at the 'La Anita' farm, where Soto rallied the disillusioned workers with a fiery speech and managed to hold back an army detachment lead by Lieutenant Colonel Varela. His forces began growing with simple workers who wanted better working conditions and eager idealists alike, slowly but steadily managing to drive the army to a stalemate until the affair became public and the government called off the military. 'El Gallego' has become a legendary figure for the workers in the FOP and anarchists worldwide, and having allied with Emilio Lopez Arango in order to secure the stability of the USA, much is expected from the chairman for the following years..."
POLITICS_MANUEL_BALDOMERO_DESC:0 "Born to a wealthy family, he attended the 'Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires', where he became an avid reader and enthusiast writer. In 1897, he travelled to Paris in order to continue his studies. He assisted Philosophy and Sociology courses and began following Jean Jaurés after the US's intervention of Cuba in 1894, where he began manifesting his hatred towards imperialism. He joined up a group of young writers in Argentina and they all affiliated the Partido Socialista. However, the Partido Socialista's conservative leadership by Juan B. Justo quickly antagonized the young group, which formed its own more combative faction within the PS.\n\nWhen the FOP broke off, Ugarte couldn't stand Juan B. Justo's inaction, and decided to leave towards the newly-born nation. While Ugarte has shown devotion to the revolutionary ideals, he also has many differences with his fellow revolutionaries. He staunchly defends freedom of religion and the concept of nations, reaffirming his love for the Argentinean nation and culture. However, he also believes in joining forces with other socialists in order to stop imperialism into South America, and as such, he'll strive to unite South America under his banner."
POLITICS_RODOLFO_GHIOLDI_DESC:0 "Rodolfo Jose Ghioldi began his career in the Argentinean Communist party right as it formed in 1917, being elected as the vice-president Federación de Juventudes Socialistas. He worked as a teacher the following years as the revolution in Russia waned, and once the events of the Semana Tragica and the Patagonia Rebelde occurred, he was laid off from his work during the following red scare due to his political views. Seeing little purpose in staying in his home city of Buenos Aires, Ghioldi pulled strings in the Communist Party to be sent to Patagonia with his brothers Americó and Orestes. After his arrival, factional disputes between the Party and the Anarchists led the leader of the party, Luis Emilio Recabarren, to eventually commit suicide. With the help of Moisés Isaakovich Kantor, Ghioldi was quickly able to campaign and become the leader of the Communist Party, leading it from 1924 onwards with the help of his brother Orestes. The compromising nature of Ghioldi was able to help defuse the tensions between Anarchists and Communists in Patagonia, helping both coordinate their efforts against their common enemy in Argentina, but while this has made him a respectable figure among moderate circles and the opposition, the radicals within the Party have been quick to accuse Ghioldi of favouring other parties' interests above theirs."
POLITICS_ALFREDO_PALACIOS_DESC:0 "Alfredo Lorenzo Ramón Palacios has long since been a symbol of the growth of moderate socialism in Argentina. Known as the 'Lawyer of the Poor' for accepting to act as lawyer in cases where his clients, usually working class members, could not afford his services without charging them, Alfredo became the first Socialist deputy in Argentina by earning the votes of the workers of the Immigrant-dominated neighbourhood of La Boca. As deputy, he continuously pushed for pro-labour legislation, but due to the complicated Argentinean political landscape or his own personal convictions, he was never able to finish any of his mandates as deputy. Having being kicked out of the Socialist party in 1915 for accepting to duel another politician (an act that was forbidden by the party), he worked mostly as Professor in the Universidad de Buenos Aires until he became headmaster of the Universidad Nacional de La Plata. Unlike the Baldomeristas in the Socialist Party, Palacios silently opposed the Patagonian revolution, choosing instead to campaign for change within the system until the Christmas Coup forced Palacios to go into hiding. Resurfacing after the Patagonian victory, Alfredo was quickly able to utilize his political clout to earn his candidacy to General Secretary, and now, he stands as the leader of the Argentinean nation. An idealist man, Palacios seeks to follow Juan B. Justo's dream, and so he'll seek to restore the Argentinean Republic as it was before the revolution, before continuing to reform it into being a workers' paradise."
POLITICS_SEVERINO_DI_GIOVANNI_DESC:0 "Severino Di Giovanni arrived in Argentina as a young adult refugee from the Italian Civil War, in one of the many waves of Italian immigrants that arrived in the nation over the last few decades. Settling in the town of Morón, he began working in the anarchist newspaper La Antorcha before the events of the Patagonic Strikes led him to flee to the South. Once in Patagonia, he settled in Puerto Madryn and began working on his own newspaper, called the 'Culmine'(Culminate), where he attempted to coordinate the southern anarchists not just against the reactionaries in the north, but against those who he deemed as pseudo-revolutionary political parties aiming to manipulate the revolution just to gain extra votes. As the war with the north dragged on, he rose quickly within the ranks of the USA, and his role as a challenging voice against Soto and Arango quickly came to a head. Now that he stands as the new Chairman, Severino has an even more radicalized version of a Workers' Utopia than any other faction dares to conceive, and it remains uncertain whether the USA will continue to support him as thoroughly as it has so far if his ideas and the idea of pragmatically rebuilt Argentina collide."
POLITICS_LIBORIO_JUSTO_DESC:0 "The son of the Argentinean General Agustin P. Justo, 'Quebracho' was raised within a military background as his father worked as headmaster of the El Palomar Military Academy, allowing Justo to spend time with whom, ironically, he'd end up fighting against during the revolution. While generally shielded by his father from the anti socialist regimes that kept appearing in Argentina, Liborio decided to embark on a personal crusade southwards, first touring through the vast expanses of Patagonia to mingle with the rural peasantry, and later to fully join the revolutionary movement as an asset, having prepared for it bringing as many books as he could muster from his father's collection in El Palomar. Quickly, he became one of the most important assets for the Communist militias trying to face off the Argentinean Army, and while far from being as skilful as his father, he proved to be a decent field commander. This, paired with his firebrand advocacy for South American revolution and the overall overthrow of Capitalism, quickly allowed him to rise in relevance in the Communist party, and while he originally lacked the political clout to beat Ghioldi, Liborio eventually got his chance to shine in the coup against the government. Now standing as chairman, Liborio has even publicly stated that he sees himself as a 'Messiah of the Latin American Revolution', and that the Argentinean revolution is just the first step towards a bigger plan..."
POLITICS_ANTONIO_SOTO_FOP_DESC:0 "Antonio Soto Canalejo was born in 1897 in the city of Ferrol, La Coruña province, Spain. His father died when he was very young, and he was forced to move to Argentina with his brother when he was just thirteen years old. Already as a teenager, he was exposed to the anarchist ideals by the people he met while he travelled with the 'Serrano-Mendoza' traveling theater company. He participated in a strike of trade employees in Trelew, Chubut province, that turned into an open rebellion, with him fighting alongside the strikers.

The strike led up to a stand-off at the 'La Anita' farm, where Soto rallied the disillusioned workers with a fiery speech and managed to hold back an army detachment lead by Lieutenant Colonel Varela. His forces began growing with simple workers who wanted better working conditions and eager idealists alike, and would later join up Alfredo Fonte's forces in 1923 in the events that lead to the creation of the FOP. 'El Gallego' has become a legendary figure for the workers in the FOP and anarchists worldwide, and he'll strive to bring the anarchist ideals of justice and equality into Argentinean society, in a peaceful way if possible and in a violent way if necessary."
POLITICS_MANUEL_BALDOMERO_UGARTE_DESC:0 "Manuel Baldomero Ugarte was born in 1875 in the Argentinean Capital, Buenos Aires City. Born to a wealthy family, he attended the 'Colegio Nacional de Buenos Aires', where he became an avid reader and enthusiast writer. In 1897, he travelled to Paris in order to continue his studies. He assisted Philosophy and Sociology courses and began following Jean Jaurés after the US's intervention of Cuba in 1894, where he began manifesting his hatred towards imperialism. He joined up a group of young writers in Argentina and they all affiliated the Partido Socialista. However, the Partido Socialista's conservative leadership by Juan B.

However, he also believes in joining forces with other socialists in order to stop imperialism into South America, and as such, he'll strive to unite America under his banner."
POLITICS_FANNY_JABCOVSKY_DESC:0 "Fanny Jabcovsky was born in 1911 in San Francisco, Cordoba, Argentina. She began working in 1925 in a textile workshop when she was just fourteen years old, but would later drop off her job to become a music teacher. She then met journalist Eduardo Edelman, with whom she'd meet writers Leónidas Barletta and Álvaro Yunque, who convinced her to become a communist in 1934. Finding her new ideals now clashing with her life, she decided to go to the FOP with her husband. Her trip was long and hard, and they barely managed to cross the Rio Negro as the Argentinean Border Guard closed in on them. An FOP's border guard patrol that was passing by intervened, and Fanny survived the subsequent skirmish.\n\nSince then, she has joined up the border guard of the FOP in order to help other revolutionaries escape to the FOP and help protect it from reactionary aggression. She became an active member of the force, participating in plenty of border skirmishes between 1934 and 1936, which have granted her a lot of experience and popularity amongst the FOP's populace. Now that she leads the FOP, she'll use her military experience to fight off imperialism, and try to unite South America under the banner of internationalism."
POLITICS_KING_OF_MAPUCHES_DESC:0 "Jacques Antoine Bernard, better known by his regal name 'Antoine III' was born in 1880 in París, France. A French nobleman, who inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucanía and Patagonia from his father, who rules over a population that is rather apathetic to him. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since then. The people he rules are as foreign to him as he is to them, which makes his legitimacy doubtful at best."
POLITICS_VARELA_PATA_DESC:0 "Héctor Benigno Varela was responsible for suppressing the Patagonian Strikes during the 20's. During his first encounter with the strikers, he was lenient and allowed them to continue, considering the strikers were right in reclaiming better rights from their employers. However, during the second Patagonian strike, his ruthlessness shined through, as he demanded the strikers to surrender unconditionally, even executing the messengers Soto sent to reach an agreement. However, he failed to contain the uprising, and his failure gained him a demotion in the army. However, since then he has worked closely with the Liga Patriotica, gaining valuable experience in anti-insurgency tactics, and now that he's military governor of the Patagonia, he will rule with an iron fist and hunt down those who once dared to humiliate him"
POLITICS_FONTE_FOP_DESC:0 "Alfredo Fonte, better known as 'El Toscano' or the Tuscan due his original birthplace in Italy, is the divisive leader of a group of foreign anarchists and local bandits known as the Red Bracelets which came into being rapidly, organically, and without much forethought during the riots between the landlords of the Sociedad Rural and the anarchists of the Federación Obrera after the elitist landlords began to violently attack Obrera union members and innocent farmers and ranchers. Acting out of opportunism both aimed at helping the people and making a name or fortune for themselves, Fonte and his men went on a fanatic spree of violence hidden behind a revolutionary and ideological facade, attacking isolated farms, homesteads, estates, and even some villages and small settlements starting back in 1921 as the wider Second Patagonian Strike burned across the state, all while creating a Robin Hood-like reputation for himself among Patagonia’s poor wherever he went as he seized wealth, land, and assets from the elite landlords and redistributing them to the masses, after taking his own cut of course. Fonte later met up with Micaela Feldman de Echebéhère during those years, who taught him true military strategy, and turned the brigand into a proper general, but Fonte would never leave his criminality or his ambitious dreams of a borderless, stateless, and non-ideological world behind him. In 1923, he met up with Soto in Paso Ibañez, as the Patagonian uprising was growing out of control, where they both agreed to work together and settle their differences as Soto assembled his broad front. Soto would lead the FOP, but Fonte would help lead its armies by commanding his Red Bracelets to act as an official arm of Soto’s government as some form of unrestricted paramilitary and hit squad, in what has since become one of the events that marked the official creation of the FOP. Since these times, Fonte has played the role of the reformed bandit turned good soldier rather admirably, but all who truly know El Toscano know that nothing shall stop Fonte’s true ambition."
POLITICS_JACQUES_ANTOINE_BERNARD_DESC:0 "Jacques Antoine Bernard was born in 1880 in París, France. A French nobleman, he inherited the self-proclaimed title of King of Araucanía and Patagonia from his father. While the Mapuches had agreed on a French king a few decades past, things have changed a lot since and as a result. As a result, the republican Brazilian government, though willing to press his claim to Patagonia to ensure its Argentine rival remains divided into the future, forced Bernard to accept a republican form of government, albeit with power firmly concentrated in his person."
POLITICS_POSADAS_DESC:0 "Rising past his mentor Alfredo ‘El Toscano’ Fonte to lead the Patagonian Revolution beyond its southern source, Homero Rómulo Cristalli Frasnelli now stands supreme alongside his compatriot and co-leader Dante Minazzoli. Together, they lead the Grupo Cuarta Internacional - a collective of writers and theoreticians within the Red Bracelets that seek to break from the non-ideological or syncretic stance of the old order in order to realize the final evolution of Fonte’s genius in the form of true Internationalism. Born in 1912, Cristalli initially gained national prominence as a star footballer with Club Estudiantes de La Plata at Buenos Aires before he graduated from schooling, eventually going on to work as a shoemaker while organizing a shoemakers’ and leather workers' union in Córdoba before fleeing to Patagonia during the final round of strikes that would see to the birth of the FOP. Bouncing around various Leftist groups like the Partido Socialist Obrero and the Partido de la Revolución Socialista, Cristalli - along with the rest of his collective hiding behind the pen-name Juan Posadas - finally drifted to Trotskyist ideals which ostracized them from the rest of the FOP’s dominant partyline, forcing the group under Cristalli to turn to fellow outcasts within the Red Bracelets. Rising within the bandito ranks by impressing and growing close to Fonte himself while also working with Fonte’s group of foreign anarchist theorists, Cristalli has become the new face of Fonte’s regime while formulating his own ideology fusing anti-statism with Trotskyist Internationalism, and while advancing his still-infantile and ever-evolving esoteric beliefs rooted in ideas of nuclear war, extraterrestrial communists, the biology and socialization of dolphins, and something the J. Posadas collective refers to as Marxist Ufology. A strange figure in a stranger land, Cristalli and the rest of those under the Posadas name now stand together to realize the genius of Fonteian Trotskyism."

FOP_the_revolutionary_fires_desc:0 "Despite the attempts of the Argentinean government to quell the flames of revolution, our movement is still alive, and growing stronger by the day. While our victory is far from certain, we must start preparing for the final showdown against the reactionaries in the north."

FOP_the_three_main_issues:0 "The Three Economic Issues"
FOP_the_three_main_issues_desc:0 "The Patagonian landscape has not been easy on our movement. We will need to be smart if we wish to prevail on the battlefield, and to prepare ourselves for it, we must first survey the issues that plague our local economy."

FOP_we_need_more_production:0 "Arms Smuggling"
FOP_we_need_more_production_desc:0 "Our first step towards a Patagonian industrial revolution is to give ourselves the means to defend our revolutionary state from the reactionaries to the north. As we even lack the means to set up an industrial base, however, we'll need to look abroad for whatever weapons our meagre resources can get us."

FOP_adapt_the_fishing_industry:0 "The Patagonian Fishing Industry"
FOP_adapt_the_fishing_industry_desc:0 "The sizeable Atlantic fishing industry in Patagonia was effectively shuttered by the revolution. Before we can build a build a navy to defend our coasts, we must first help our fishermen reclaim the seas and restore Patagonia's mothballed merchant fleet. Above all else, this will help us feed both our people and our army."

FOP_prospect_for_resources:0 "Exploiting Resources"
FOP_prospect_for_resources_desc:0 "The Patagonian economy is grievously underdeveloped with many of the region's riches being left trapped beneath the earth. There is no reason for this other than the neglect of the previous regime and now that we're in control of our own fate we'll have to jump-start a resource industry to support both our people and our revolutionary army."

FOP_grandes_trabajos_de_progreso:0 "Industrial Planning Scheme"
FOP_grandes_trabajos_de_progreso_desc:0 "The old regime left Patagonia in a state of abject destitution, lacking any semblance of modern industry. Patagonia's own industrial revolution will have the ultimate goal of bringing prosperity to our people, but before we can fulfil it we'll need to establish the supply chains needed to fuel it from abroad."

FOP_where_we_gonna_build:0 "Central Construction Agency"
FOP_where_we_gonna_build_desc:0 "Abandoning the exploitation and whims of the free market, we'll set up a central planning committee in Puerto Madryn to oversee future developments in the region. By setting clear goals for ourselves and our workers, we'll be able to create the basic industry and infrastructure that Patagonia needs more efficiently."

FOP_fund_north_patagonia:0 "Divert Funds to Chubut"
FOP_fund_north_patagonia_desc:0 "The Northern Region of Patagonia, Chubut, has become the heart of the revolution, but it is far from being the muscle capable of carrying out our revolution. By diverting funds to the region, the Central Construction Agency hopes to be able to set up development areas for future industry."

FOP_fund_south_patagonia:0 "Divert Funds to Santa Cruz"
FOP_fund_south_patagonia_desc:0 "The Southern Region of Patagonia, Santa Cruz, has been largely a backwater region of Argentina, with barely a few fishing towns and a few mines worth noting. By diverting funds to it, the Central Construction Agency hopes to make the region catch up with Chubut in terms of development so that it may hopefully become less of a weight, and more of a supporting province for our efforts."

FOP_factory1:0 "Patagonia's Industrial Revolution"
FOP_factory1_desc:0 "Through the great efforts of our labourers the goal of turning Patagonia into a fully modern industrialized state is finally within reach. It won't be long now until we've gone from being one of Argentina's poorest regions to having our very own industrial revolution!"

FOP_military1:0 "Military Autarky"
FOP_military1_desc:0 "Gone are the days of relying solely on the kindness of our comrades. Through our toil and dedication, we're close to achieving self-sufficiency. With a steady stream of guns being produced by Patagonian hands for our war effort, we'll be better prepared to defend ourselves than ever before."

FOP_further_boat_conversions:0 "Expand the Fishing Fleet"
FOP_further_boat_conversions_desc:0 "Our fleet is currently able to meet the bare basics of our people's needs. It's a start, but if we devoted more of our resources towards expanding our fleet we'll be able to truly enjoy the riches that the oceans can offer us."

FOP_chilean_naval_assistance:0 "Chilean Naval Assistance"
FOP_chilean_naval_assistance_desc:0 "Our comrades in Santiago have aided us with soldiers, guns and resources since the dawn of our revolution. In exchange for some future concessions down the line, they'll be willing to send some of their naval engineers our way to expand one of our minor ports to house a shipbuilding facility as well."

FOP_request_syndie_countries_ship_designs:0 "Request International Navy Assistance"
FOP_request_syndie_countries_ship_designs_desc:0 "With a coast guard in place to protect our coast, we now need to look for a means of striking at the jugular of our enemies. If our allies prove willing to provide us with a handful of their older submarine models, we should be able to wage a guerrilla war beneath the seas if any dare to attack us!"

FOP_request_syndie_subs:0 "Request International Submarines"
FOP_request_syndie_subs_desc:0 "Forts and land warfare can only get us so far. If we wish to strike against our enemies, we will need to request old submarines from our allies. Even if they can only spare a few relics from the Weltkrieg, it would go a long way to safeguard our coastline from hostile forces."

FOP_syndie_support:0 "International Officer Training"
FOP_syndie_support_desc:0 "Most of our navy is currently commanded by a mix of the captains of converted civilian vessels and inexperienced civilians voted into a commanding position. If we could convince the Third International to help us train our officers, it could prove invaluable in our efforts to strengthen our navy."

FOP_coastal_defences:0 "Coastal Defences"
FOP_coastal_defences_desc:0 "Should our coast guard be forced back into port or sunk, our cities will be completely exposed to naval landings by the reactionaries. To prevent them from employing such cowardly tactics against us, we must build defensive fortifications along our coast."

FOP_the_population_issue:0 "Population Surveys"
FOP_the_population_issue_desc:0 "In order to properly prepare for the incoming war, we need to carry out a census of our population, and begin drafting conscription lists, as we will need to dig our claws deep for every reserve soldier we can send to the front."

FOP_rally_the_people:0 "Rally the Workers!"
FOP_rally_the_people_desc:0 "The Frente Obrero's Cause is just! The workers of the north would be wise to see this, and while their voices are kept quiet by the northern regime, we can still reach them via our informants and hidden transmissions. We will help them reach our lines so that they can help us overthrow the regime that dared oppress them."

FOP_increase_conscription:0 "Women at Arms"
FOP_increase_conscription_desc:0 "Our adversaries to the north have held down the women of Argentina for far too long. Therefore, we'll give a rifle to every woman that's willing to serve in our army in the spirit of equality and actively encourage more to do so. While some petty traditionalists may disagree with this measure it'll help greatly to even out the odds against Buenos Aires."

FOP_mass_army:0 "Mass Recruitment Scheme"
FOP_mass_army_desc:0 "In order to make up the difference in manpower we need to bring as many people as possible into our ranks. We'll set up recruitment offices across our revolutionary state and send out officers throughout the countryside to encourage people to volunteer for our cause. While the hasted efforts may degrade our army's quality slightly, it'll effectively solve our manpower crisis."

FOP_mass_training_methods:0 "Improvised Weaponry"
FOP_mass_training_methods_desc:0 "Just like we had to cut some corners to make up the difference in manpower between us and Buenos Aires, we need to do the same for our equipment. We'll set up a series of workshops in the countryside and use Patagonian ingenuity to turn common civilian utilities into deadly weapons of wars. A makeshift weapon is better than an empty hand!"

FOP_more_is_needed:0 "Encourage the Unwilling"
FOP_more_is_needed_desc:0 "Our enemies gravely outnumber us and to make up for this weakness we'll need to encourage the unwilling to do what's right and take up arms against the enemy. While this move will disrupt Patagonian society, it's better than to end up as slaves under the reactionaries."

FOP_imports_from_chile:0 "Chilean Military Aid"
FOP_imports_from_chile_desc:0 "As we stand on the precipice of war, our comrades on the other side of the Andes have informed us that they're ready to step up their military aid to us. This will go a long way towards equipping our fledgling revolutionary army with proper guns."

FOP_internationale_guns:0 "Internationale Guns"
FOP_internationale_guns_desc:0 "Our comrades in Chile can only provide us with so much. In order to make sure every soldier has a rifle and enough ammunition to make up for the superior numbers of the counter-revolutionaries, we'll need to look abroad for help. Thankfully, our comrades in Paris and London will be able to provide us with what we need in the spirit of red solidarity."

FOP_indiscriminate_conscription:0 "Indiscriminate Conscription"
FOP_indiscriminate_conscription_desc:0 "In order to solve our manpower shortages we may be forced to expand the size and scope of our conscription efforts. Every man and woman need to do their duty for the revolution. Even if the quality of our army will suffer until we win the war due to the influx of unfit soldiers into the ranks, an unfit soldier is better than no soldier at all."

FOP_call_on_chilean_manpower:0 "Call for Chilean Volunteers"
FOP_call_on_chilean_manpower_desc:0 "Many of our comrades across the Andes are eager to spread the revolution and fight for their country, but are unable to enlist and fight in the Chilean army. We need to get the message to as many of them as possible that there's a ration, rifle and an opportunity to spread the revolution on our side of the border."

FOP_call_on_european_help:0 "Call for European Manpower"
FOP_call_on_european_help_desc:0 "Even if we gave a rifle to every man and woman in Patagonia we'd still be outnumbered. To match our enemies, we must call on our comrades in Europe to help bolster our ranks. Luckily for us, the cradle of the world revolution is full to the brim with revolutionaries that are eager to help the socialist cause. All we need to do is to put out the word and help them reach our shores."

FOP_international_army:0 "International Force"
FOP_international_army_desc:0 "There are untold thousands of aspiring and veteran revolutionaries across the world that are ready, willing and able to enlist with us. We only need to spread the message and aid as many of them as possible to join us. While this will lead to some coordination issues between our soldiers, it'll make sure our ranks are full."

FOP_international_officers:0 "International Air Volunteers"
FOP_international_officers_desc:0 "While the idea of a Patagonian air force is presently unrealistic, our increased contacts with foreign revolutionaries has allowed us to reach out to experienced pilots around the world ready to turn the skies red. While these daredevils can only provide their own planes, having them on our side will deny the capitalists the uncontested skies they're expecting!"

FOP_manpower_issue_solved:0 "An End to the Manpower Crisis"
FOP_manpower_issue_solved_desc:0 "Desperate times have indeed called for desperate measures but thanks to our efforts we now boast a force that can stand up to the oppressors in the north. When the foe comes to try and take our freedom away we're finally ready to fight them with a fully manned revolutionary army!"

FOP_man_the_border:0 "Fortify the Border"
FOP_man_the_border_desc:0 "With the enemy's superiority in numbers and equipment a defensive stance is not out of the question. By dotting our front line with fortifications and trenches we'll make sure that our former oppressors will pay a heavy price for every inch of Patagonian soil they try to steal from our liberated workers!"

FOP_new_infantry_equ:0 "Infiltrating the North"
FOP_new_infantry_equ_desc:0 "Fighting the enemy on their terms will be the death of us. Instead, we'll destroy our foe by fighting unconventionally and forcing them to meet us on our terms, not theirs."

FOP_organise_the_troops:0 "European Way of War"
FOP_organise_the_troops_desc:0 "Most of our fighters are militiamen and guerrillas without any formal military backgrounds. While more than capable of defending our country, some of our European comrades are offering to help us organize our divisions according to a more regular model. Integrating more of these veterans to train our militias will also help us improve their overall efficiency as well."

FOP_mountain_professionals:0 "Strike the Railroads"
FOP_mountain_professionals_desc:0 "Argentina is a vast land of mountains and rivers. This forces the enemy to rely heavily on railroads to move their forces through the country. If we could prepare a series of railroad sabotages, we should be able to temporarily cripple their mobility in the first crucial weeks of the war."

FOP_infiltration_time:0 "Infiltrator Cells"
FOP_infiltration_time_desc:0 "Argentina is a vast land of mountains and rivers. This forces the enemy to spread their forces throughout the country. If we could infiltrate and sow the seeds of rebellion, we should be able to temporarily tie up their resources in the first crucial weeks of the war."

FOP_armored_mechanized_research:0 "International Armour Specialists"
FOP_armored_mechanized_research_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg proved the effectiveness of tanks in modern breakthrough operations. For our revolutionary armed forces to fully transition into a modern army, it's necessary for us to develop a mechanized branch. By soliciting help from British and French engineers, we should be able to speed up this process significantly."

FOP_military_research:0 "Standardizing Our Tactics"
FOP_military_research_desc:0 "The very decentralized nature of our forces has led to a situation where each squad has its own tactics and methods, and sometimes they aren't even that organized. While unpredictability has its advantages, we should at least standardize our army tactics to the point where our officers can at least predict what moves their comrades can be expected to make."

FOP_army_drills:0 "Veteran Instructors"
FOP_army_drills_desc:0 "Since our revolutionary army mostly consists of volunteer militias drawn from local population, their quality is severely inconsistent from regiment to regiment. By carefully picking out and embedding some of our more more capable and experienced experienced veterans with our fresh  recruits we'll be able to even out their performance and better preserve the army's institutional knowledge."

FOP_new_training_methods:0 "Unconventional Supply Networks"
FOP_new_training_methods_desc:0 "The way we fight means that our revolutionary soldiers often find themselves outside of anything resembling a conventional supply chain. By setting up forward supply caches ahead of advances and training our fighters to better forage for supplies behind enemy lines, we'll vastly improve our overall supply situation."

FOP_military_research2:0 "Foreign Doctrine Assistance"
FOP_military_research2_desc:0 "As our army gains experience, our tactics are also improving. However, now that we're starting to move away from the basics, we need to start defining what shape our grand strategy should take, and we should look to the Internationale for help in this matter."

FOP_national_defence:0 "A Militarized Society"
FOP_national_defence_desc:0 "There can be no permanent peace with the counter-revolutionaries and to safeguard our revolution we'll need to militarize our society for the inevitably conflicts that lie ahead.

Only time will tell whether this will be successful..."
FOP_moderate_decentralization:0 "Moderate Decentralization"
FOP_moderate_decentralization_desc:0 "While a compromising man, Soto is still an anarchist, and has therefore ordered for some of the responsibilities of the Congress to be delegated to local and regional councils, only keeping largely essential tasks for the central government.

FOP_Steer_the_Market_desc:0 "The founder of the Partido Socialista, Juan B. Justo, was a loyal follower of the ideas of free trade and the wealth it brought.

FOP_maintain_revolutionary_democracy_desc:0 "Despite the pleas to return to the old constitution, the truth is that the revolution has changed Argentina forever.

FOP_Integrate_Old_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "While some would argue that integrating parts of the old Republican system in Argentina would be a mistake, the truth is that Argentina had taken a slight pro-Worker turn during the last three decades, only coming to a grinding halt with the Uriburu coup.

Our lands are certainly not very populated, but there is a real concern among nativist groups that an excess of people may arrive from Europe, fleeing the terrors of war and Syndicalism.

Much of their possessions were 'collectivized', that is, stolen and ran into the ground by socialists who don't know the first thing about the lay of the land.

Now, in the modern day, the tanks, air planes and machines of war brought to bear can dwarf any effort an unequipped man can pour in the battlefield, as there is little bravery can do to pierce the plating of enemy armour.

Many of the righteously outraged officers moved elsewhere, becoming exiles in either Algiers or across the courts of Europe and the palaces of the Americas, or adventurers in the Far East. By formally establishing posts to recruit officers and attract technical and planning personnel, we can ensure the realm has an up to date military that is capable of defending the nation for the dangers abroad, while also making diplomatic inroads with the French exiles as a whole."

Some are visible, like the abandoned villages, the stolen artefacts, but others, more subtle, such as the loss of oral tradition, knowledge, and language. All of which were almost ruined by the occupation by the Castilian forces; they not only held the local culture in the lowest regard, but actively persecuted it, as they saw the brave natives as a threat to their rule. Now, with the crown's authority protecting the people, the culture of the Mapuche can properly be recorded for future generations to come."

FOP_summon_a_native_congress_desc:0 "In order to establish a proper ruling body for the Kingdom as a whole, we need not only Mapuche representatives, but ones from all tribes under the protection of the crown, great and small. With the envoys of all the tribes, peoples and organizations gathered, we will form a Royal Council which will help His Majesty while he adjusts himself to his new country, by taking on several administrative tasks and roles for him."
FOP_trading_tradition:0 "A Trading Tradition"
FOP_trading_tradition_desc:0 "As the communities in the area now ruled by the Kingdom of Patagonia were traditionally small, trade was needed to maintain the flow of needed goods between the small realms of tribes that encompassed it. While times have certainly changed, the strategic position of the Kingdom at the very edge of the world is once again an advantage, as the constant turmoil across the North Atlantic increases shipping traffic in the far south, putting our realm and its ports in a uniquely strategic position we'd be foolish not to take advantage of."
FOP_demand_repatriation_of_Mapuche_artifacts:0 "Demand Repatriation of Mapuche Artefacts"
FOP_demand_repatriation_of_Mapuche_artifacts_desc:0 "The poverty imposed by the cruel measures of the occupying colonizers drove many chiefs and holy men and women to sell their most prized possessions to be able to simply eat. Silverware, weapons, art; all taken away to be shown as some curiosity to arrogant men in Buenos Aires. Thankfully, His Majesty knows that requesting these artefacts back is a trivial matter, considering the current situation and proper subjugation of the former oppressors."
FOP_port_expansion_for_natives:0 "Port Expansion for Natives"
FOP_port_expansion_for_natives_desc:0 "While for a long time the ports of Patagonia were designed by immigrants, for immigrants, now the time arrived to make sure the riches of the sea belong to Patagonia's people. While much was damaged, even more destroyed, in the wars that ravaged the land, we will rebuild and persevere, as the folk living in the former land of giants become giants in their own right, riding above the tempestuous waves of the southern Atlantic."
FOP_king_personality_cult:0 "Royal Personality Cult"
FOP_king_personality_cult_desc:0 "The figure of our king is not one widely known about the local populace, not only due to his limited grasp of the language, but because much of his work to restore the kingdom was done behind the scenes. As such, his lifelong struggle for Patagonia often passed as a quest for personal ambition rather than duty and selflessness. Even when he was mocked and derided by foreign courts and press, when he had to almost ruin himself travelling abroad to gather support, or how he even now moved to a land he never saw, to fulfil the oaths of his predecessors. As we establish more and more schools in both Spanish and native languages, we cannot neglect the need to remind the people of the great live and cause of Antonie, King of Patagonia."
FOP_basic_military_production:0 "Basic Military Production"
FOP_basic_military_production_desc:0 "While we have many allies abroad that can supply us with weapons in times of need, the fact is that the nation remains at permanent risk, until we have at least a minimum degree of self sufficiency in our weapons manufacturing. While truthfully, the numbers wont be high, the numbers of our small and elite military are also not, and as such, we predict that even small plants can supply our forces locally to perform at an optimal level."

FOP_proclaim_the_king_as_permanent_toqui_desc:0 "While traditionally, the role of Toqui was one of the military commander in chief, elected by the tribes in times of war, the Crown is now the main guardian and defender of the peoples of the region, and such, is the de facto toqui, perhaps the greatest of them in history. By solidifying the powers and roles of the monarch with primarily native than foreign titles, we can ensure that even our government itself is safeguarding the lifestyle and culture of the native peoples."

FOP_legacy_of_Toki_Leftraru_desc:0 "Every nation has a hero, a founding figure of chivalry, honour and ideals that stands the test of time. The greatest of all Toquis, the man known to the Europeans as Lautaro, fought the greatest and most powerful empire in human history and won, while leading the Mapuche people to victory on key engagements, not simply mere ambushes. His work uniting the tribes, and laying the foundations upon which our monarchs later would build upon, cannot, and should never be, forgotten by those who now reap the fruits of his labour"
FOP_status_of_kindred_natives:0 "Status of Kindred Native Tribes"
FOP_status_of_kindred_natives_desc:0 "While considered the main native group of Patagonia, the Mapuche are not the only natives of Patagonia. The Chewel Che, who lived here in the far south even before the Mapuche, are a broad group of locals which inhabit western Patagonia, and they have suffered even more than the Mapuche themselves during the occupation. However, their very name is an exonym, a Mapuche word for 'hardy people', and they will endure, but now, they have their native kin to help defend and guard their rightful lands"

FOP_diplomatic_connections_desc:0 "Our King, while in his lifelong exile, spent much of his time making friends in high and low places across the courts and palaces in both sides of the Atlantic. Even more important, news of our people's plight, which only grew under the rule of the bandits of the Worker's Front, has garnered great amounts of good will among foreigners, and such, our struggle to rebuild the nation will find many ready allies across the world."

### Fonte's Coup ###
FOP_fonte_coup:0 "El Toscano Hijacks the Revolution"
FOP_fonte_coup_desc:0 "Maneuvering past his rivals and opponents in an expert utilization of the chaos that has consumed Patagonia and wider Argentina, the former vaquero turned bandit and revolutionary Alfredo Fonte - aka El Toscano or the Tuscan - has seized control of the government with the backing of his Red Bracelet gang headed by himself along with close confidants like fellow Italian immigrant José Aicardi aka El 68, the native Argentines and radical union protestors Bartolo Díaz and Florentino Cuello, and many more within Fonte’s varied group of international exiles and global outlaws. Though Fonte himself remains largely indifferent to ideological pursuits aside from his vaguely-Leftist Robin Hood-like actions and his deep-seated hatred for national borders, his diverse clique of outcasts pulls from across the Leftist spectrum, creating a varied and unstable administration ever in flux but united against the ideas of statism and landlordism. Vaguely anarchist and libertarian in their outlook, but fanatically violent, criminal, and bloodthirsty nonetheless, the Red Bracelets of El Toscano now control the destiny of Patagonia and the fate of her people."
FOP_illegalist_chaos:0 "Sow Organized Illegalist Chaos"
FOP_illegalist_chaos_desc:0 "Whether it be by design or sheer happenstance, Fonte and the Red Bracelets have begun to sow disorder and destruction across Patagonia’s few densely settled areas as well as across the border into our neighboring states, planting the seeds of revolution both with Illegalist acts through the propaganda of the deed, and with petty violence when all else fails to get the message across. Atop this massive and completely justified crime wave, Fonte shall reveal all remaining enemies of the state hiding out among the purified proletariat while also leveling all that preceded his fiery ascension before laying the groundwork for things to come, for atop this clean slate Fonte shall build utopia."
FOP_rise_against_landlords:0 "Ride Against the Landlords of Sociedad Rural"
FOP_rise_against_landlords_desc:0 "The insatiable greed of the Sociedad Rural is what caused the very protests that led to our creation and subsequent rise, so it is only polite that we now come to return the favor. These landlords and all other founts of elitism must be annihilated if we are to truly heal and move on. Redistributions and populist handouts to the masses funded by this wave of revolutionary justice shall of course follow, after Fonte takes his cut as always, but first we must get to eradicating the last of these parasites once and for all."
FOP_bandits_at_the_reigns:0 "Chival Bandits at the Reins"
FOP_bandits_at_the_reigns_desc:0 "Like Fonte himself, many of the founding members of the Red Bracelets - when not being sourced from Patagonia’s jails and prison camps - are former vaqueros and farmhands who took it upon themselves to take up arms against the landlord menace as they pressured our last free unions left spared from the tyrannical grasp of Buenos Aires and the Northerners’ influence. Now, we simple farmfolk fight against one of Latin America’s dominant powers in order to see our dream of a free and rural Patagonia realized, but this dream can only be realized if Fonte is unobstructed in his march to victory. The entire apparatus of state, including all executive, legislative, and judicial power shall be transferred to his hands as he works to tear down the state and create a bandit’s utopia for all true patriots of the cause, while his legion of lowerclass loyalists toils away to build his envisioned paradise and his armies of bandit revolutionaries and militant cowpokes protect everything we shall achieve."
FOP_reactionaries_to_work:0 "Put the Reaccionarios to Work"
FOP_reactionaries_to_work_desc:0 "Seeking to find use for the growing masses of reaccionarios - or traitors to the revolution deemed reactionary by Fonte’s own will, José ‘El 68’ Aicardi has begun the creation of a labor camp system designed to construct and maintain the necessary infrastructure and industry needed to fuel Fonte’s ambitions. Though the bulk of the help won’t be skilled or suited to the work, we shall make do with what we have available, for there are always more counterrevolutionaries and reactionaries in need of re-education."
FOP_statelessness:0 "Statelessness at the End of Fonte’s Barrel"
FOP_statelessness_desc:0 "Utilizing ‘revolutionary’ violence and big stick ‘diplomacy’, Fonte shall tear down the failed carcass of the prior regime so that it can be replaced by his perfected concept of bandit statelessness and kleptocratic anarchism, no matter the cost. All aspects and remnants of the old order, both Syndicalist and Capitalist, shall be wiped away so that a new, free existence can be ushered in to replace it with an anarchist existence not built on theory but on action, with society urged along by the business end of Fonte’s sidearm and his legion of banditos led by El 68, ensuring that there are no gods, no state, and no masters in this new world - only Fonte."
FOP_formalize_red_bracelet_army:0 "Formalize the Army of the Red Bracelet"
FOP_formalize_red_bracelet_army_desc:0 "Seeking to transform his forces from a mere collection of gangbangers, streetrats, and armed ranchers into an organized and effective fighting force capable of going toe-to-toe with other modern armies, Fonte has pushed forward with the creation of the Ejército de Pulsera Roja - or the Army of the Red Bracelet. Replacing our former organizational structures, or lack thereof, this new unified army shall serve as the main military and security force of Fonte’s regime as well as his personal bodyguards and secret police. With its leading officers only answerable to Fonte himself, this new army of bandits in a new skin shall hopefully give our military the kick in the pants it so desperately needs; if not, at least it can hopefully stand as a nice facade."
FOP_red_robin_hood:0 "A Fiefdom for Patagonia’s §RRed Robin Hood§!"
FOP_red_robin_hood_desc:0 "Known to the isolated, poor, and rural populations of Patagonia’s steppe as a sort of exceedingly violent Robin Hood-like figure, stealing from the landlord elites and redistributing what he and his men don't take for themselves among the thankful populace, Alfredo ‘El Toscano’ Fonte has move to officialize this reputation as a part of his regime. Expanding programs related to revolutionary redistribution, populism, and public charity while also accelerating the creation of his own cult of personality using this Robin Hood aesthetic and image as its main fulcrum, Fonte shall bring the people what they want while ensuring that each and every one of those pleading souls knows exactly who to thank for such a bountiful existence."
FOP_bandit_internationalism:0 "The Sole Heir of True Internationalism"
FOP_bandit_internationalism_desc:0 "Though against practicing or even reading any theory, and though completely disconnected from any official Internationalist cause, Fonte’s strange non-ideological ideology holds many similarities with Leftist schools of Internationalism - especially Fonte’s hatred for factionalism and national borders. With Internationalism’s main figure dead and disgraced, and with theory-based political thought being eradicated here in Fonte’s Patagonia, now would be the perfect time to exclaim that our own Alfredo Fonte is the true heir to the Internationalist cause - a new breed of Internationalism freed from theory and from established political elite so that the borderless dream can be fully created and realized through Fonte’s action alone."
FOP_stability_terror:0 "Stability Through Terror Under El 68"
FOP_stability_terror_desc:0 "Under the iron grip of José ‘El 68’ Aicardi, the Red Bracelet army and the rest of Fonte’s gangs and paramilitaries under the control of various other international allies turned bandit officers of his like José Graña the Spaniard, Francisco Aguilera the Paraguayan, the Scots Alex MclEod and Jack Gunna, the escaped African laborer Cantrill who once slaved for the Portuguese, the oriental carter Ángel ‘Palomilla’ Rodríguez, and many more shall enforce Fonte’s word as absolute law, as well as the only law in this stateless paradise we now call home. Through terror campaigns aimed at rewarding the innocent and delivering swift, violent retribution to all those who oppose our destiny, law and order - at least as Fonte defines them - shall be preserved no matter the cost."
FOP_vaquero_socialism:0 "Vaquero Communalism with Our Americanos"
FOP_vaquero_socialism_desc:0 "Pulling from Fonte’s own past as a vaquero along with ideas of Cowboy Communalism pulled from the American Southwest and northern Mexico, the American bandito-theorists and former farmhands John Johnston, Carlos Hantke aka Charles Manning, Frank Cross, and Charles Middleton, a form of rural-focused and agrarian-specific Left Libertarianism framed around the revolutionary heroism of the humble cowboy and their bandito counterparts shall come to influence the ideology and society of the Red Bracelets. With these ideas and allies, we take what little good America can offer while shunning everything else that gluttonous titan of Capitalist suffering stands for.""
FOP_european_anarchism:0 "European Anti-Statism by Lorenz, Peyré, and Vlasko"
FOP_european_anarchism_desc:0 "Longtime members of Fonte’s international clique of gangsters and banditos, the French anarchist Federico Villard Peyré, the Russian anarchist John Vlasko, and the leading German anarchist Franz Lorenz who himself stands at Fonte’s side as his leading ideaologue have finally succeed in their longtime lobbying, and now are free to usher in their ideas on fringe forms of European-inspired Anarchism, as well as from other European-inspired groups of a similar ilk such as the Galleanisti of New York or the varied anarchist and semi-anarchist movements active across Asia in places like Russia and Vietnam. From Illegalism and Individualism to Synthesism and Egoism, all kinds of pure Anarchist thought shall come to form one of the core pillars of our developing ideology, freeing the people from hierarchs and deities, now and forever."
FOP_agrarian_ansynd:0 "Agrarian Anarchism with Federación Obrera"
FOP_agrarian_ansynd_desc:0 "Working with the one union that would still give us a seat at their table after valiantly, or violently, defending them in the initial strikes against Sociedad Rural, the varied Anarcho-Syndicalists, Anarcho-Communists, and Revolutionary Socialists of the Federación Obrera Regional Argentina, Fonte has agreed to allow some ideological influence into his revolution. Working with these fellow farmer-focused socialists, we shall continue to advance the dream of total statelessness under Fonte with infusions of Anarcho-Syndicalism and Anarcho-Communism while working with local unionist movements, decriminalizing certain Syndicalist groups once branded as rivals and traitors by our regime, and supporting the agriculturally-focused, rancher and farmer-dominated economy of our nation."
FOP_bandits_beyond_borders:0 "Bandits Without Borders"
FOP_bandits_beyond_borders_desc:0 "With the unique and syncretic, stateless dream of Alfredo ‘El Toscano’ Fonte now fully realized here in Patagonia, we must march beyond in order to save the rest of Latin America from the endless oppression subjected to all who slave under the tyranny of national borders. Our armies of bandito socialists and vaqueros-turned-revolutionaries shall ride across the continent, and perhaps beyond, in order to save our chosen proletariat from the dastardly existence they suffer through at the hands of reactionary capitalism and counterrevolutionary ignorance. Quickly, we bandits now march for a world without borders, so let us ride into this bright, crimson, and free future under Fonte!"

FOP_posadas_at_the_helm:0 "Argentina's Trotskyist New Dawn"
FOP_posadas_at_the_helm_desc:0 "With the hero and national patriarch Alfredo ‘El Toscano’ Fonte finally settling into his comfortable and well-earned retirement, the civilian government he has chosen to replace him now rises under the duo Homero Rómulo Cristalli Frasnelli and Dante Minazzoli and their Grupo Cuarta Internacional clique who all collectively share the pen-name Juan Posadas. By their hand, Left Internationalism and the spirit of Trotskyism shall be officially and fully fused into the regime El Toscano built as Cristalli and Minazzoli work to spread the genius of Fonte, Marx, and Trotsky beyond the surly bonds of this earthly coil."
FOP_final_nuclear_war_revolution:0 "Towards the Final Nuclear War-Revolution"
FOP_final_nuclear_war_revolution_desc:0 "Breaking from most of his contemporaries that seek revolutionary action through more traditional means, the duo more commonly known collectively as Juan Posadas advocate for a more accelerationist approach. Believing nuclear war to be inevitable, our leaders seeks to bring about what they call the ‘War-Revolution’ - aka the promulgation of total nuclear war on a global scale in order to ‘settle the hash of Capitalism and Syndicalism’ once and for all, and to cause mass and rapid societal collapse that hinges on the theory that from the ashes, future generations shall naturally and organically work towards the creation of a truly Communist society on their own when nothing else remains to derail the process. With this theory forming the central pillar of Posadist Internationalism, we shall do whatever it takes to bring about this perfected form of revolutionary action, even if we must bathe the world in fallout just to do it."
FOP_leninist_ufology:0 "Spread the Truth of Marxist UFOlogy"
FOP_leninist_ufology_desc:0 "Built on the still-developing esoteric studies of Homero Rómulo Cristalli Frasnelli himself, our society has begun to adopt the esoteric form of Marxist ideology the Posadas duo preaches. Believing UFO’s to be observers sent by all-powerful alien societies that inevitably must thrive within a Communist society of their own design after moving past vices like the need for impulsion, dominance, violence, and competition, Cristalli and Minazzoli shall try to teach the rest of the proletariat beneath them to look to the skies as they do, creating a new wave of cultural revolution and socio-economic reformation centered around the spread and popularization of these outlandish but still humanitarian theories until they form the foundations of everyday thought for our people. Luckily, Cristalli has been able to glean some information that may prove useful to this end of preparing humanity for life in space both socio-culturally and biologically based on the cetacean studies of international figures like John C. Lilly or the young Igor Charkovsky, so let us begin the preparations in earnest as we move as one to embrace this new take on life."
FOP_society_along_the_lines_of_our_extraterrestrial_comrades:0 "A Societal Vision From Beyond the Stars"
FOP_society_along_the_lines_of_our_extraterrestrial_comrades_desc:0 "The existence of UFOs and their ever-increasing presence on this Earth must mean that the alien intelligences sending these spacecraft must be fellow Communists, for such a level of technological prowess is naturally only possible under the freeing genius of Socialist ideology, as Capitalism forces selfish thinking and self-serving attitudes when compared to the civilization-wide focus and humanism true Communists possess, meaning that there is potentially a limitless amount of possible allies and partners we can amicably cooperate with out there in the crimson cosmos. We must appeal to the beings on other planets, when they come here, to intervene and collaborate with Earth's inhabitants in suppressing poverty, but until we do make contact, we shall build a Trotskyist paradise that even these celestial gods would be proud of."
FOP_redefine_fontes_internationalism:0 "Redefine Fonte's Internationalism"
FOP_redefine_fontes_internationalism_desc:0 "Though Alfredo ‘El Toscano’ Fonte was a genius, even the great Red Robin Hood of Patagonia had his flaws - particularly when it came to his hatred of organized political or ideological theory. Though a pseudo-Illegalist himself that displayed some semblance of Internationalist ideas with his strong stance against Statism and the concept of national borders, Fonte never directly declared an allegiance to any particular school of Socialist thought. To rectify this misstep, the duo known as J. Posadas have moved to officially codify Trotskyism or Left Internationalism as state ideology. From a mere band of bandits to an organized coalition of true revolutionaries, theoreticians, and politicians, Cristalli and Minazzoli shall fuse and fulfill the dreams of Fonte and Trotsky no matter what."
FOP_reach_out_to_political_elements:0 "Reach Out to Political Elements"
FOP_reach_out_to_political_elements_desc:0 "Although the Fonte regime took some small steps towards creating a functional government apparatus and wider bureaucracy, it was mostly for show as Fonte and his gang of outlaws, former vaqueros, and exiled anarchists ruled without any standardization while more formalized allies like the Federación Obrera were dragged along for the ride. This era of chaos and disorder cannot stand however if we have any hope of creating a sense of lasting stability. In a move to rectify this glaring issue, Posadas and their clique the Grupo Cuarta Internacional and the recently reorganized Partido de la Revolución Socialista shall create a true government structure that fuses the anti-Statism of Fonte with the Trotskyism of Cristalli and Minazzoli, hopefully bringing some semblance of modernity, organization, and normalcy to this backwards corner we call home."

fopintro.1.t:0 "The Revolutionary Fires"
fopintro.1.d:0 "Argentina was in a state of chaos during the Weltkrieg, with British companies exploiting its people and resources to get everything they could for the war. This lead to unrest throughout the nation, but especially in the south of the country, in Patagonia. Extremely poor working conditions brought the rise of Socialism and Syndicalism, with thousands of people refusing to work and rioting through the streets. The British forced the Argentine government to intervene, turning riots into rebellion during the events that led to the Semana Tragica. The situation only escalated further and further from there, with the LP growing in strength in the main cities, particularly with the Buenos Aires City Oligarchy. However, deep in the south of Argentina, a new type of unrest grew. What started as a simple strike of rural workers became a general strike in the south, demanding for the payment of wages that had been due for months and the improvement of working conditions. While an agreement was reached at first with the creation of the 'First Rural Agreement of the Patagonia', when the land owners didn't keep their promises, the workers started another general strike, forcing an armed retaliation by an expedition lead by Lieutenant Colonel Hector Benigno Varela. The workers, trusting Varela after he had helped create the first agreement, would try to negotiate with the officer, only to be met with a dreadful realization: Varela was there to demand nothing more than unconditional surrender of the strikers, and he was willing to shoot all who opposed to keep control of the Patagonia."
fopintro.1.a:0 "A Sad Start for Our Revolution"

fopintro.2.t:0 "The Patagonia Rebelde"
fopintro.2.d:0 "The workers, rallied behind the figure of Antonio Soto and Jose 'Facon Grande' Font, decided that the time for revolution was now. Despite the disarmament clause in the original Rural Agreement, most of Soto's anarchists had left their weapons to Alfredo 'El Toscano' Fonte, after he and many other more radical 'anarchists' refused the agreement, and so Soto found himself having to ally with the Patagonian bandit in order to get the equipment to arm the workers to fight. After the initial victories of the Army, the workers dealt a decisive victory at La Anita farm, and with the coordination of the FORA through telegraph lines and message runners, the Second Great Patagonic Strike only grew and grew in strength, with the Argentinian army being unable to deal with it without sparking heavy political backlash in the capital for the popular UCR in power."
fopintro.2.a:0 "United Workers Will Never Be Beaten!"

fopintro.3.t:0 "The Contemporary Frente Obrero Patagonico"
fopintro.3.d:0 "Many years later, the fires of the revolution continue to burn in Patagonia. Chile had to step in and protect the FOP from the north, and so holds much sway in how the nation is run. Antonio Soto, leader of FORA and one of the main participants in the revolution, has lead the nation ever since, leading a loose and fragile coalition of Anarchists, Communists and Radical Socialists. Due to political instability, proper elections have not been held yet, however Soto has promised to step down from his position once the crisis with Argentina ends, whatever the result may be. There are worries that the election won't take place in time, for due to the rise of Carlés in the north, people fear that an invasion will happen soon. However, with the Patagonic Strike being seen as the beacon of anarchism and socialism by many, international support both by the Internationale and by willing anarchists and exiled Bolsheviks alike is not in short supply, and so the workers that may appear to be stranded in such an apparent desolate wasteland like Patagonia may still stand a chance..."
fopintro.3.a:0 "Viva la Revolución!"

fop.2.t:0 "The FOP Calls for Chilean Volunteers"
fop.2.d:0 "We have just received word from our neighbours in Patagonia that they are requesting we send them volunteers for their upcoming war against the core Argentinian government. We have promised that we will aid them in their future war, and they are our chance to defeat the Argentine menace. However, we also need to cover our own fronts in the Paso de los Libertadores and in the Atacama Region, how should we react?"
fop.2.a:0 "Send them volunteers."
fop.2.b:0 "What benefit do we gain? Refuse them."

fop.4.a:0 "We will not forget this."

fop.5.t:0 "The FOP Requests Manpower"
fop.5.d:0 "The Workers Front of Patagonia, known as the FOP, has requested that we aid their struggle by sending them manpower and equipment. Soon they will face war with the Argentine government, and they need to be prepared for when it happens. If they succeed, they can become a permanent foothold of Syndicalism in South America."
fop.5.a:0 "We will send men and guns."
fop.5.b:0 "We will only send men."
fop.5.c:0 "South America is too far away..."

fop.6.t:0 "The Hannaford Idea"
fop.6.d:0 "Guillermo Mac Hannaford, an ex-army major of the Argentinian military, has been condemned for a lifetime of prison for seemingly betraying the reactionary Argentinian Military and leaking official documents to Paraguay and Chile. Luckily for us, insiders in the Argentinian military have indicated that he'll be transported to the Prisión Regional del Sur, a high security prison in the territory of Neuquén, which conveniently sits less than a few hundred kilometres from our border. \n\nUnexpectedly, many of the different factions of our military have jumped at the chance of presenting plans to recover this would-be revolutionary from the reactionary grasp. While some of them are insanely optimistic, the ones that have stood out the most have been a proposal by Buenaventura Durruti's 'Avengers', which suggests utilizing a militia attack as a distraction in the Viedma Area to act as a diversion of a full-scale breakthrough into the prison. In stark opposition of this plan, comrade Iosif Dzugashvili, in his experience, has suggested we pick a smaller team to infiltrate the area, with a couple columns on standby to assist in case the situation escalates, and instead rescue the officer. Dzhugashvili may be across the planet in his hold in Tbilisi, but this ally of the World Revolution still seeks to aid us in our revolutionary endeavors, and his advice is certainly appreciated given his background in these matters. The last proposal to be seriously considered, thrown in by Marc Augier, is to simply send a column in the prison's general direction, and let the officers in charge deal with whatever challenges lay ahead.\n\nEach plan carries its own risk for us, unfortunately. While Durruti and Dzugashvili's experience as bank robbers and terrorists in Spain and Russia give them some pedigree in this kind of covert operations, there's no denying we can't exactly commit all the resources they ask of us. By contrast, while the Augier plan is less reliable on paper as the column may just collapse and scatter, it's certainly helping us commit less assets to what's essentially a non-priority target. What should the Revolutionary Committee favour?"
fop.6.a:0 "Give Durruti what he asks."
fop.6.b:0 "Comrade Dzhugashvili’s plan will have our resources."
fop.6.c:0 "Go through with Augier's plan."
fop.6.e:0 "This is a waste of time."

fop.7.t:0 "Hannaford made it out Alive"
fop.7.d:0 "Our mission was a great success, with us successfully getting Hannaford out of prison alive, as well as most of our troops. Our troops ran circles around the Argentinian garrison and it is not only a military success, but a moral victory as well. If we keep this up, there may actually be a chance for our revolution to succeed!"
fop.7.a:0 "Excellent."

fop.8.t:0 "Hannaford Died but our Troops Escaped"
fop.8.d:0 "While sieging the prison Hannaford was trapped in, he was accidentally killed by a stray bullet. However, most of our troops escaped unharmed, and so while the mission failed, morale still remains high among our troops."
fop.8.a:0 "That's not terrible."

fop.9.t:0 "Major Mission Failure"
fop.9.d:0 "The mission failed massively, while they were able to escape the prison with Hannaford they were misdirected on their return. This allowed a nearby garrison to pincer our troops between them and the prison garrison with Hannaford dying and most of our troops being lost in the escape. This defeat will surely impact the morale of our troops, and it puts a dent on our leadership's reputation."
fop.9.a:0 "Damn."

fop.10.t:0 "Hannaford is Refusing to Help"
fop.10.d:0 "We successfully got Hannaford out of prison alive, but there is still a problem. He is currently refusing to aid our revolution. Hannaford himself, at least according to the intelligence we could gather on his imprisonment, was accused of spying for Paraguay but such accusation had little evidence to support the case, leading some of our command to speculate that he was being framed by a rival in the Army. With that in mind, we believe we can take advantage of the administrative chaos in the North for our agents to dig up information that may help him see things our way. Perhaps, if we show him the truth of the matter, he'll join our side..."
fop.10.a:0 "Send the word to Buenos Aires, Our Agents should be able to Find something Worthwhile"
fop.10.b:0 "Just Interrogate Him and Extract whatever Useful Information we can from Him"

fop.11.t:0 "Hannaford has Accepted to Work with Us"
fop.11.d:0 "Our Agents were able to get information on Hannaford's case via army informants, and have managed to uncover a seeming conspiracy to remove Hannaford from command in the Army, with the tacit approval of many members of the GOU. By all means, this move seems to be an undercover form of a purge, and it's hard to assess if many other officers have suffered unfair demotions or imprisonment in the same way Hannaford has. With that information, we have compiled a file and given it to Hannaford, who, while taking his time to take it all in with some level of disbelief, has finally accepted to work with our government. In return he has requested that our agents in Buenos Aires arrange for the transfer of his family to our territory."
fop.11.a:0 "A Worthy Price for a Worthy Officer"

fop.12.t:0 "Hannaford has Refused to Cooperate"
fop.12.d:0 "Despite our attempts at uncovering information about the Hannaford case, we have unfortunately been unsuccessful and he has proven unusually hard to persuade. Without much choice, we have instead chosen to imprison Hannaford and proceed to extract whatever useful information he has for us."

Major riots have broken out in cities like Salta or Mendoza, where our control is slim at best.

While many point out that by granting these demands we would be healing the divide created by the previous regimes, there are also many detractors that point at the nearly reactionary traditionalist, identitarian, and borderline secessionist nature of the demands. With that in mind, should we truly grant them what they ask for? or should we reassert our authority to also apply the lessons of the revolution in their communities?"

In the book, Santillán analyzes both countries and explains in detail the steps needed to turn both economies into fully working anarchist states.

The 'Three Economic Issues', as dubbed by the ruling Cabinet are:\n\n-A lack of naval infrastructure to both trade and oppose the Argentinian navy in any significant capacity.\n-A lack of basic resources and resource infrastructure. This means that, even if there are some limited reserves of iron and coal in our territory, we both lack the infrastructure to refine it into steel, as well as having an underwhelming infrastructure for its transport.\n-A lack of industry. This one has become the most apparent, as we now rely on Chile for practically everything except for the most immediate supplies like food and water. We will need to solve this, not just so that we can further bolster our combined strength but also so that we can stand up for ourselves in the case that Chile has to pull out their support to defend themselves.\n\n If we are to survive against the reactionary government in the north, we will need to undergo drastic change to get the men and materiel needed for the revolution to even survive.

The first delegation to take the stage was the one of the FORA, advocating that only the leaders of the Liga Patriotica (LP) should be put on trial, arguing the concepts of Obediencia Debida (Due Obedience), which would absolve most military commanders and civil servants from any connections to the regime unless they were direct members of the LP. This proposal, while being incredibly unpopular with the other Congress factions, it's very popular outside of the TUC as many former civil servants had no choice but to join the new regime or be left unemployed in the middle of an economic crisis.\nThe Anarchists were the next to propose a solution to the old regime: Each person, no matter their rank and file, would be put on trial individually for their actions, and, if found guilty, would either spend a considerable time in prison or suffer the ultimate penalty for their crimes against the workers. A naturally popular proposal amongst radicals, Socialist delegates have protested the implications of the proposal, as it would mark the revolutionary movement to be as bloodthirsty and oppressive as the Liga Patriotica itself was against the workers.\nFinally, the CUSC, with support from the Internationale, has proposed for the former members of the regime to be taken to forced labour camps. These camps would allow the convicted to work off their sentences, and possibly avoid the death penalty by providing a useful service to the nation. The proposal seems to be striking a good middle ground, while not as merciful as the Socialist one and not as harsh as the anarchist one, it's drawing moderates from both sides towards it trying to draw a compromise, even if the bill has not exactly clarified how long would the sentences be, or how the conditions or locations of the camps would be.

However, with the success of our revolution, the different trade union delegations disagree on what path to follow going forward.\n\nThe FORA, for their part, propose that no change should be held, and that the territories considered for provinces, like Santa Cruz and Chubut in the South, should be turned into provinces along with the remaining territories. By contrast, the CUSC has said that the system should be changed, in favour of a centralization of power that puts more emphasis on the Federal Government, somewhat resembling the Unitary proposals that had appeared during the Argentinian Warlord Period. Completely opposed to both proposals, the USA has proposed that the system should be abolished instead and a new one based around popular councils should be formed.

The CUSC, on their end argue that the Constitution should be redrafted, and while some sections of the original could remain, a new one reflecting the new character of Argentina should be created. The USA, unsurprisingly, has opposed to both proposals, and has decided that they'd prefer the nation to simply nullify the existent constitution and move forward without one, instead encouraging individual communes to adopt a constitution if they so desire.

Chairman Severino has pushed for a bill in the largely Anarchist dominated Trade Union Congress where he proposes the seizure of all Catholic church assets, the persecution and imprisonment of former clergy members, and the prohibition of any and all religious practices on public life, effectively turning Argentina into an atheist nation. As one of the most deeply catholic nations in the region, when news of this bill came out, harsh public backlash surfaced, and not only from Christian groups, as the bill could apparently target the Jewish and Muslim minorities in Argentina as well. While passing the bill would be seen by our fellow revolutionaries as the fulfilment of our long awaited promises, we need to keep in mind that passing the bill may lose us more support than it'll gain us. Perhaps we can go back to the drawing board and draft a less aggressive bill..."

Many revolutionaries in the anarchist ranks had strongly advocated for the full incorporation of women into political life, and were quite militant about the concept of female equality both in the workforce as well as in the battlefield. However, while the chairman would like nothing more than to grant these much awaited rights due to personal reasons, there are matters of state at hand that would prevent such a bill to be successful. Argentinian society has been traditionally male-dominated, and very strictly traditionalist in that regard, and such a bill is bound to lose us significant support in the countryside and even amongst revolutionary circles. Perhaps instead we should seek a more slow approach, and slowly introduce women into political life in order to accustom society to their participation..."

In a meeting with the Bishop of Buenos Aires, Soto has agreed to the Church's demands while keeping the Secular nature of our state, allowing the many Catholic schools and rural missions to continue operating in exchange for the tacit approval of the catholics of the new government. While some clergy members have rejected the results of the meeting, a revolutionary commission will be reassigning these rebellious bishops to reeducation camps, where they shall learn how to coexist with the workers. The only concern remaining is the Vatican's stance on the matter, but given the instability in the Italian peninsula, it is largely believed they will not jeopardize the Argentinean clergy by opposing this newly found compromise."

The idea of the ban had been considered for weeks now, with many detractors on the opposition, but the argument that these practices were remnants of the capitalist means to oppress the working class ended up winning out in the Congress in the end. The ban, while applauded by the anarchist groups, has been extremely poorly received by the public, with many taking to the streets to protest the government's decision to leave thousands of people unemployed, and many hundreds of thousands more without any form of entertainment.

Given the limited numbers and slow reproduction rates of whales, and aiming to protect the Southern right whale as their breeding grounds are huge sources of tourism, the Argentinean government had labelled whales as protected species, yet due to the political instability, it failed to enforce its protections and foreign ships wound up taking advantage of the situation. However, now that the inneffective reactionaries of old are gone, it is on our best interest to keep foreign exploiters away from our nation, and as such, Chairman [FOP.GetLeader] has proposed a bill in which whaling will now be banned in the Argentinean sea, and any ships caught in the act shall be prosecuted. While some conservatives have labelled the measure as extreme, as it now bans all whaling in the region as opposed to just over the protected Southern right whale, the overall public has received the ban positively.

However, the government stepped in to help the association, along with many other sports' associations in order to help transitioning them into the new system, and with the government intervention, changes to the AFA's competitive rules have been revised. One example of this regards to the teams from the interior, since they had been excluded from the professional cathegories of the Association, favouring instead teams from the Capital and its surrounding area. Starting from this year's tournament onwards, teams from the interior, like Rosario's 'Newell's Old Boys' and 'Rosario Central' which are now formal members of the proffessional division, will be encouraged to join the league in order to foster a more equal representation throughout the nation, as opposed to focusing the sport on the Capital and the surrounding area."

While the general censorship of press has allowed most of the details to remain muddy, the news of the events still managed to get out, with some sensationalist outlets in exile labelling Liborio as 'The New Juan Manuel de Rosas'.

For now, they have barricaded themselves inside the Presidential House, with the defense of the area being led by Comrade Dzhugashvili. Holding radio contact with the forces under siege, General Liborio Justo has decided to take the initiative, asking reinforcements to be mobilized from Tigre and Mar Del Plata to aid the Capital forces. However, while they march to help the capital, the anarchists have begun consolidating their hold on the Capital City, and Justo has decided to cross the Avenida Parque towards Buenos Aires' Industrial heartland. However, with the limited forces he currently possesses, two options have been brought forward. He could assault one of the revolutionary armories set up near the Parque Centenario, which would cut off the Anarchists from a significant asset to increase their numbers, or he could secure the Fabrica Militar de Polvoras y Explosivos in the north, a few kilometres away from the famous Hippodrome, which would cut off the Anarchists from a major weapons factory."

However, this plan is risky, as we don't have a confirmation the artillery is actually there, and we could be potentially wasting time the defenders don't have. The alternative is to launch a full on assault on the Casa Rosada's surroundings, and try to open a way for our men to be evacuated. While Justo thinks it is possible for us to break through, the Command has had to acknowledge that casualties will inevitably be high as the Anarchists still own the Artillery pieces and will likely attempt to do suppression barrages on our forces.

While we have made a series of barrages on the area, it's clear that their forces are hiding inside the buildings and are taking negligible damage based on our scout reports. Comrade Justo on his end has proposed for the artillery to support smaller offensives from the Avenida de Mayo, the Avenida Julio Argentino Roca and the Plaza de Armas, all of them from the opposite direction of the Plaza San Martin. This would ensure the attacks hit the anarchist weak spots and allow our forces to break through the enemy lines in a slower, yet more methodical way.

Scout reports indicate we outnumber them, and by attacking them we may catch them off-guard.

Some officers have stated that a retreat would help us last long enough for reinforcements from the south to arrive in strength, but some have rightfully pointed out that if we retreated further, we will lose the capital and we would be forced to surrender.

Since then, there have always been rumors that he has been traveling the country with his band of mercenaries, raiding villages and pillaging homes in the name of some pseudo-anarchist cause likely devised just to justify his violent greed. It appears these officers are here to confirm these rumors, stating that some of their troops had been raided by a group of bandits lead by Fonte not too long along, with most of his men not surviving the encounter. It would be too bold to just arrest him now, for technically we have not caught him doing anything illegal. Also, he did also help us with the revolution. However, we will keep an eye on him."

If we wanted to now, we could imprison him, or even execute him for his grave misdeeds against the Patagonian people.

As the meeting began to draw to a close, the two men heartily accepted their Supreme Leader’s offer, paving their way towards higher positions in the state’s military hierarchy. Just before leaving, Fonte turned to ask the one young man’s name again as to not get the paperwork wrong.

However, what started as a simple interest in their ability to give birth in a space-like medium has evolved and mutated into a borderline obsession as Cristalli gets more and more invested in this field of study, expanding his horizons from just studying these animals and their birthing habits to trying to learn how to communicate with them on a personal and intellectual level by studying their social behaviors. Regardless of the strange nature of many of these theories or their dubious usefulness, dolphins have become both a symbol of our revolutionary regime and a widely beloved icon of national pride, with Cristalli even being quoted in English as having said ‘Dolphins are cool’ on more than one occasion.

In 1932, the military regime collapsed after Uriburu's death. After a power struggle, UCR member Julio Roca became the new head of state. Roca began to seek a peace settlement with the Patagonians. Carlés took advantage of the popular outrage and launched a coup d'état on the 24th of December 1935 with the support of navy and parts of the military.

FOP_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Partido Demócrata Nacional\n§LNational Democratic Party§!\n§gThe PDN (PNA until 1932) was one of Argentina's oldest political parties and closely connected to the Roca family, who provided two Argentinian Presidents in the last 50 years: Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz (1880-1886, 1898-1904) and Julio Argentino Pascual Roca (1932-1935). It was created on March 15th, 1874, after the union of the Autonomist Party and the National Party. It was since its inception a highly important party, and the Roca family became very influential within the party, with Alejo Julio Argentino Roca Paz becoming a president in 1880-1886 and 1898-1904. It later became the bedrock of la edad de oro (1880 - 1916), boasting a booming economy and a flood of immigrants from Europe which strengthened Argentina's industry, becoming one of the most prosperous contries in the world before the Weltkrieg. Meanwhile, its main rival became the Radical Civic Union (UCR). It was criticized for its use of election fraud, which lead to PNA dissolving with its members joining Conservative Party and the Democratic Progressive Party.\nFollowing Uriburu's death in early 1932, the PNA was reborn as Partido Demócrata Nacional (PDN) for the upcoming 1932 elections with Julio Argentino Pascual Roca being its leader, and PDN, thanks to electoral fraud, won by a landslide. Roca was inaugurated president, and he promised to find a compromise with their syndicalist neighbors Patagonia and Chile. Although many hoped that Roca would bring back the good old times and strengthen Argentina's position globally, this did not happen. Although he took a less radical course than Uriburu and developed plans to recapture the lost territories at Patagonia, launching small skirmishes into FOP territory and successfully retaking Isla Grande de Tierra del Fuego thanks to the navy, he scrapped plans to send the army into Patagonian core territory, deciding to focus more on improving the economy. Roca's takeover disgruntled the military and the LPA, and due to his political liberalisation, rumours started to spread in 1935 that there would be an imminent peace settlement with the Patagonians, causing outrage across the nation. This was enough for Carlés and the LPA to launch a coup on Christmas day, putting Roca and his ministers under temporary house arrest as Carlés proclaimed himself President.§!"

FOP_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Unión Cívica Radical\n§LRadical Civic Union§!\n§gFounded on June 26th, 1891, the party quickly became influential over Argentine politics, causing the 1893 Radical Revolution and the 1905 Radical Revolution, which later led to reform in terms of election fraud. Two presidents of Argentina to be part of the Radical Civic Union were Hipólito Yrigoyen and Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. In 1916 the Argentine General Election took place, being the first where the Roque Sáenz Peña Law was implemented, establishing universal, secret and compulsory male suffrage. Yrigoyen, candidate of the UCR, ended up winning the elections. His tumultous presidency between 1916 - 1922, with the secession of Patagonia, had de Alvear replace him as the UCR candidate for the 1922 elections, which he won. Argentina saw slight economic improvement right until the British Revolution occurred, which led to the crash of April 1925. Despite this, de Alvear ordered the navy to capture the Falkland Islands and South Georgia. This increased morale and trust in the government, but led to the radicalisation of the military which had been previously humiliated by the Patagonian Rebellion, and now stood in the shadow of the popular navy.\nIn 1928, Yrigoyen was surprisingly appointed as the Radical Civic's Union candidate for the general elections instead of the current and relatively popular Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear. Despite this, Yrigoyen won by a large margin, which led many to speculate that it was due to election fraud. Yrigoyen's most important opposition was the military, which started planning a coup against him. This eventually happened on September 6th, 1930, as Uriburu, with support from Carlés and the LPA, took over and proclaimed himself president of Argentina, banning political parties, arresting democratic politicians and suspending the 1853 Constitution. Yrigoyen's supporters, called Yrigoyenists, were tortured alongside other political opponents of his regime. Yrigoyen himself was held under arrest at the Martín García Island. Uriburu eventually died in early 1932, and Argentina went back to democracy under conservative politician Julio Argentino Pascual Roca. Yrigoyen died in 1933, and now de Alvear is leading the party.§!"

His family moved to Argentina when he was three years old, and since he was a teenager he has dedicated himself to a life of banditry and freedom. He leads his gang of anarchists and bandits known as the Red Bracelets along with fellow Italian immigrant and criminal José ‘El 68’ Aicardi - named after the number of his prison cell in Ushuai Penitentiary, and local Argentine unionists Bartolo 'El Paisano' Díaz and Florentino 'Gaucho' Cuello, with whom he has raided farmsteads and estates alike in order to bring fortune, fame, and greater manpower to his cause. During the first Patagonic strike, it was Fonte who sent the formal letter to the government in the name of the strikers, despite only taking part of the strike as an excuse for him to kidnap wealthy landlords and asking hefty sums in exchange for their lives. After the Second Patagonic Strike came about, Fonte met Micaela Feldman de Etchebéhère, who had fled to Patagonia with his husband, and both proceeded to teach Fonte a more refined school of strategy that has only made El Toscano and his dreaded Red Bracelets even more of a force to be revoked with or better yet, feared.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Fonte has been noted to have a psychotic and ruthless personality, which lowers the overall morale of his troops."

When his mandatory 4 years of service were over, he travelled to the United States to learn more about gardening, and it was there where he learned about anarchism. After taking part in several strikes and industrial sabotages, he was deported back to Germany in 1920. Having learned in the US about the growing anarchist movement in Argentina, he quickly sailed once more towards the new world, arriving at Buenos Aires the 29th of September 1920. He began working in the FAUD sponsored local newspaper 'Der Syndikalist' of the German community until the Great Patagonic strikes came to be. After the initial months of near disbelief at the events, Wilckens decided to join his brothers in the south with Andrés Vázquez Paredes helping in his escape. Despite his extremely pacifist posture, he has decided to join the FOP's militia and his gentleness as well as his conviction has managed to make him rise through the ranks\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Although willing to take up arms for the anarchist ideals, Wilckens despises violence in all of its forms.\n- Aligned with the Moderate Anarchist faction."

With the outbreak of the Weltkrieg, he ran into issues with the law and went into hiding, finding his way to Detroit where he became an active participant in the anarchist scene of the city. In June of 1920, he served as a waiter aboard the cruise ship Andrea Costa where he secretly returned to Genoa, working alongside the new Socialist Republic to repair the railroads before leaving for England surreptitiously 7 months later. In March of 1925, he then travelled to Buenos Aires and then crossed the Rio Negro to link up with the Anarchist forces there, meeting Severino di Giovanni. His ability to clandestinely move about and terrorize the forces of the reactionary north, along with his fierce loyalty and determination, quickly prompted him to rise up the ranks.\n- Aligned with the Radical Anarchist faction."

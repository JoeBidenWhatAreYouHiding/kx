### Leaders ###
POLITICS_URG_CNA_DESC:0 "With the 1917 constitutional referendum and a constituent assembly in 1918, a new constitution was enacted in 1919 by President Baltasar Brum, which stated that the executive power has to be shared between the President of the Republic and the 'Consejo Nacional De Administración' ('National Administration Council'). The council is made by nine members that are elected every six years, which generally are six from the ruling party and three from the opposition. The role of the president belongs to the council candidate with the most votes, but he can be only responsible for Foreign Affairs, National Security and Agriculture, whereas the NCA is responsible for the rest of the executive branch responsibilities."
POLITICS_GABRIEL_TERRA_DESC:0 "José Luis Gabriel Terra was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated as a lawyer in 1895, where he later became a minister for President Claudio Willman, where he proved great expertise in economic and diplomatic affairs. Later on, he became one of the members of the Constituent Assembly in 1917 and was a minister during Baltasar Brum's rule. He is affiliated to the Partido Colorado, although he has proven to have opposing views with the leader of the party, Jose Battle Ordóñez. He's a known conservative and authoritarian, and now that he rules Uruguay, he'll try to centralize his power, balance the state's budget and avoid liberal and progressive reforms."
POLITICS_ALFREDO_FERRARI_DESC:0 "Alfredo Baldomir Ferrari was born in 1884, in the small town of Paysandú. He graduated from the Military academy in 1905, and later on he studied to become an architect, alternating between his two careers until reaching the rank of general in 1935. Now he's been named military governor of Uruguay, and while he has shown leniency towards his rebellious citizens, he still has to maintain order in the country, and will suppress any group that might dare disturb it."
POLITICS_EMILIO_FRUGONI_DESC:0 "Emilio Frugoni Queirolo was born in 1880, in Montevideo. He was already a political activist when he was in high school, and took part in the 1904 civil war defending the government of José Battle y Ordoñez. When the war was over, he formed the 'Centro Obrero Socialista' which would start the process of creating the 'Partido Socialista de Uruguay' in 1910, with Frugoni as its general secretary. He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalize, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."
POLITICS_PAULINA_LUISI_DESC:0 "Paulina Luisi Janicki was born in 1875, in Colón, Entre Rios Province, Argentina. Born to an Italian father and polish mother, they moved shortly after to Paysandú and then finally settled in Montevideo in 1887. She became the first Uruguayan woman to study medicine when she began her career in the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1900, where she graduated as a physician in 1908.\n\nShe affiliated the Partido Socialista de Uruguay when it was founded in 1910, where she found the place to fight for cultural and civil rights for women in a political platform, and then went on to create the 'Consejo Nacional de la Mujer Uruguaya' and the 'Alianza Uruguaya de Mujeres' in 1919. She later went on to France to specialize in Dermatology and venereal diseases. She then witnessed the events of the French Syndicalist revolution herself, which inspired her to take those ideals back to Uruguay. Now that she is in power, she plans to follow the example of her European Comrades."
POLITICS_JUAQIN_ILLA_DESC:0 "Joaquin Secco Illa was born in 1879, in Montevideo. He graduated the 'Universidad de la Republica' as a Lawyer and was designated professor of civil rights of that university in 1906. He formed the 'Unión Civica del Uruguay' in 1912 as a Christian democrat party, but rejoined with the 'Blanco Party' later on. A known conservative and Christian, now that he sits in the Palacio Estevez, he shall lead Uruguay prioritizing Christian values and stability over progress."
POLITICS_LUIS_ALBERTO_DE_HERRERA_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto de Herrera y Quevedo was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated with a doctorate in Law and Social sciences from the 'Universidad de la Republica'. He participated in the 1897 revolution by the Partido Blanco in and left for the US in 1901, where he served as ambassador for Uruguay. In 1920 he was chosen as director of the Partido Nacional and was the president of the CNA from 1925 to 1927.\n\nWhile his reputation is far from perfect, with multiple conflicts with more radical and progressive factions within the PN, he has proven in the past that he has a genuine concern for the well-being of the Uruguayan citizens and workers. Now that he leads Uruguay, he shall focus on reducing government intervention on the economy, improving the agrarian economy instead of industrializing Uruguay and, inspired by Alexis de Tocqueville's writings, increase the local autonomy of each city and town within Uruguay."
POLITICS_LUIS_BATLLE_BERRES_DESC:0 "Luis Conrado Battle Berres was born in 1897, in Montevideo. He became an orphan when he was eleven, and went to live with his uncle, Jose Battle y Ordoñez. While he was living with his uncle, Jose managed to become president of Uruguay, and inspired Luis to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de la Republica', where he graduated as a lawyer and joined the Partido Colorado, and thanks to his uncle's connections, has remained a popular choice in the party as a deputy, and now even managing to become a presidential candidate.\n\nDespite his young age and inexperience, the legacy of his uncle, which many regard with having transformed Uruguay into the 'Switzerland of South America', is still alive in the memory of many Uruguayans. As his uncle, he'll champion the ideals of his new 'Batllismo', an interventionist state which shall guarantee social plans for the poor and progressive reforms for the disenfranchised."
POLITICS_JUAN_DE_AMEZAGA_DESC:0 "Juan Jose de Amézaga Landaraso was born in 1881, in Montevideo. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1905, and travelled for a year and half between Germany and France. His experience in Europe brought him closer to the ideals of Batllismo, and joined up the Colorado Party as soon as he had returned. He became a deputy for the town of Durazno in 1908 with only twenty-seven years, receiving praise and support from Jose Battle y Ordoñez himself. He has since then climbed through the ranks and now that he sits in the Palacio Estévez, he's bound to continue the old Batllist policies."

URG_continue_council_rule_desc:0 "With Baltasar Brum and his reform in 1918, our country finally reached the end of an almost century old dispute between the 'Blancos' and 'Colorados'. This ushered in the prosperity that came afterwards, and it would be foolish to end this system because of a worldwide catastrophe and risk going back to the times of constant brawling between our factions."
URG_promote_political_stability:0 "Promote Political Stability"
URG_promote_political_stability_desc:0 "Uruguay is no stranger to political instability. For almost a century the conflict of 'Blancos' and 'Colorados' almost tore apart our nation more than once. With the council, however, we've managed to unite both parties, who now both try their best to cooperate and lead us to a better future. We shall encourage this harmony, and make all those who strive for compromise and cooperation exemplary citizens."
URG_encourage_political_confidence:0 "Ensure Political Confidence"
URG_encourage_political_confidence_desc:0 "The people of Uruguay have a choice in the elections. However, many people still do not vote, believing they will not have any effect on the result, or not even knowing about the election at all! We should try to promote confidence in the political game, to encourage stability."
URG_power_to_the_council:0 "Expand the Council's Authority"
URG_power_to_the_council_desc:0 "Now that we're done dealing with the crisis, we can go back to issues we had before it.

URG_restore_presidentialism_desc:0 "Ever since Baltasar Brum's presidency, the president was sidelined and the real power was held by the council.

It is time for one man to seize back control for the good of the nation, and that man shall be Gabriel Terra."
URG_expand_presidents_power:0 "Expand the Presidency"
URG_expand_presidents_power_desc:0 "With the Constitutional Reform that went into effect in 1919, the presidency had to share most of its power with the National Council of Administration.

URG_encourage_political_participation:0 "Encourage Political Participation"
URG_encourage_political_participation_desc:0 "One of the major fears with the loss of the council is the lack of representation for opposing parties.

URG_stabilise_the_nation_desc:0 "With the economic recession afoot and the dissolution of the council, strikes and riots fill our streets, and criminals feel emboldened to realize their heinous activities.

URG_compromise_between_sides:0 "The Politics of Consensus"
URG_compromise_between_sides_desc:0 "Uruguay shall not be built by one single group, or one single party.

URG_balanced_budget:0 "Balance the Budget"

Time will tell however if his hardline pacifism will truly work to reform Uruguay..."

URG_improve_workers_rights_desc:0 "One of our main pool of support are the industrial workers of Uruguay, who, while not great in number as our neighbour Argentina has, are still a huge part of the Uruguayan society as a whole.

URG_support_trade_unions:0 "Support Trade Unions"
URG_support_trade_unions_desc:0 "The Trade Unions of Uruguay have played a huge role in our victory, and we shouldn't underestimate their influence. However, they are also extremely vulnerable to radicalize and start heeding the violent revolutionary call of the PSiU, and in order to avoid it, we should woo them to our side by granting them concessions to make sure they won't hinder our reforms."

URG_temporary_tax_increases_desc:0 "During the Welfare State, not only did the state provided social benefits, but it also tried to keep taxes at a minimum.

URG_education_desc:0 "Despite having a good education system compared to the South American standards, it's still not good enough compared to other places in the world, such as Europe.

URG_air_not_independent:0 "Integrate the Air Command"

### Events ###
urg.1.t:0 "The Oriental Republic of Uruguay"
urg.1.d:0 "The oriental republic of Uruguay has, for most of its history, been deeply divided. Even after the end of the Uruguayan Civil War, there was still strong civil unrest between the two main political parties, the Colorado and the National party. No middle ground could be found, and the division seemed to have no end, but the nation was still functional. When the Weltkrieg struck the world, Uruguay remained neutral, for both Germany and Great Britain were important trading partners. Although Uruguay was able to keep trade going throughout the conflict, the war did not have a major impact on the nation, and Uruguay continued to exist as a weak and unstable nation. That was, however, until 1919, when a new constitution was created and agreed upon by both parties. The constitution allows the Colorado party to keep the role of president, but it would have its powers limited and shared with the National Administration Council, made up of elected representatives of both the Colorado and National party. This balance of power has ushered in a golden age for Uruguay, bringing peace and stability to the population. The council had its powers extended even further in 1928, to the point where it's more influential than the president. The council has become fundamental in Uruguayan politics. Due to this political golden age, the economy has improved drastically, allowing the government the ability to establish Uruguay as a strong welfare state. However, the politics of Uruguay are just as volatile as always. Should disaster strike, like the sudden collapse of the agricultural industry, the cracks in the council might begin to show, and some politicians who believe the president must have more power might try and use this as an opportunity to bring an end to the Council's rule."
urg.1.a:0 "Libertad o Muerte!"
urg.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the River Plate!"
urg.2.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, we exported tonnes of foodstuff and cattle products to all sides, mostly to both the United Kingdom and Germany. This continued even after the Weltkrieg up until the 1925 revolution in Britain, when our exports to the British ended almost entirely. Ever since then our economy has grown more and more dependent on Germany's. This benefited us due to the strength of the German economy, bringing years of constant economic growth.\n\nSuddenly, however, our economy has stagnated. Businesses have began to close due to ripples of the Black Monday crisis. Thankfully, our two main trading partners, Germany and Brazil, have continued to import our food stocks and other exports. However, many economists fear that Germany will be forced to end their imports, which will bring a full national crisis.\n\nFor now, it seems the Uruguayan golden age is over."
urg.2.a:0 "Oh no!"
urg.3.t:0 "Farming Exports Collapse!"
urg.3.d:0 "It seems our fears have become reality. Due to the Black Monday economic crash, Germany has been forced to terminate most of our trade deals. Farmers across the nation now have produced far too much grain and cattle products with no one to buy them. This has lead to farm owners having to sell at extremely low prices or just destroy their leftover stock. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, because the farm owners cannot afford to employ any workers any more. It seems what was originally an initial economic downturn has become a national crisis."
urg.3.a:0 "Disaster!"
urg.4.t:0 "Deepened Political Crisis"
urg.4.d:0 "Since the start of the Black Monday crisis, any idea of political co-operation has gone out the window. People throughout the nation are losing faith in our government, and riots are occurring in the cities. Suddenly, more extremist ideologies are beginning to gain an audience with the population, where most people have lost everything. The socialist rebellion that occurred in Argentina could happen here too. If we do not start dealing with these issues, we could lose control of our nation. However, there are doubts as to whether the government is strong enough to change anything."
urg.4.a:0 "Worrisome."
urg.5.t:0 "The Council Begins Deliberations on Solutions"
urg.5.d:0 "The National Administration Council have finally met up to try to discuss solutions on the economic and political problems facing Uruguay. The council have only just started discussing solutions on these issues, even though the initial crash occurred weeks ago. One of the main criticisms of the council is the fact that it has taken so long for the government to even begin to try to solve the economic issues. Critics argue that the crash may not have been as bad had the council been able to respond faster to the problem. However, this is not the fault of any one person in the government, but rather the government structure as a whole. The council cannot react quickly to problems because of the need to discuss these issues for many weeks before finally reaching a conclusion. Some politicians currently serving on the council fear that it is too late, and that the council is on deaths door."
urg.5.a:0 "Why must they take so long?"
urg.6.t:0 "The Council is called into question!"
urg.6.d:0 "After the council announced a week ago that they would begin working on solutions, it did not seem to quell the criticisms of the government, but made these criticisms even louder. The loudest critic of the council is President Gabriel Terra of the Colorado party, who states that the council might be effective in times of peace and order, but in times of disaster, a powerful president is necessary to react to problems as they come, rather than waiting to discuss it with the other side. President Terra has stated that it is time for the council to die, and now we must make the decision. Should we maintain the council, or is it time for a strong president once more?"
urg.6.a:0 "Maintain the Council."
urg.6.b:0 "Abolish the Council."
urg.7.t:0 "Council Maintained"
urg.7.d:0 "Even with the anarchy and criticisms against the National Administration Council, we continued the rule of the council, and it seems this has paid off. The violence on the streets has decreased back to ordinary levels, for faith in the government is increasing again. The people now trust that the Council will be able to make the right choices for Uruguay, even if it takes longer than a president would."
urg.7.a:0 "Our Democracy Is Strong!"
urg.8.t:0 "Anti-Syndicalist Pact with Paraguay"
urg.8.d:0 "It appears some of our greatest fears have become a reality. The Syndicalists of Patagonia have successfully beaten the Argentinean army and have taken over the country. Suddenly, we have neighbours who are ideologically different to us, and have shown that they are prepared to fight for their beliefs. We should now be trying the find as many allies as we can, and our best choice is probably a nation in the exact same situation as us; Paraguay. Although in the past we have had our disagreements, now is not the time to dwell on history.\n\nMany people in our government agree it is time to approach Paraguay about plans for a mutual defence pact between us."
urg.8.a:0 "Approach Paraguay."
urg.8.b:0 "We can stand alone."
urg.9.t:0 "The Argentinean Navy Joins Us"
urg.9.d:0 "In the wake of Argentina being overrun by syndicalist rebels, the Argentinean navy deserted their old commanders and requested that they dock in our ports, which our naval leaders allowed. They have decided that now that Argentina has fallen to syndicalism, they would rather fight for us and stay safe in our docks."
urg.9.a:0 "We will keep them safe."
urg.10.t:0 "Socialist Protests Throughout the Nation"
urg.10.d:0 "Due to the economic crash that is affecting the nation, the popularity of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, the main socialist party of Uruguay, has increased dramatically, and have organised protests throughout the nation. They are using the failure of the government to deal with this crash as proof that the council is flawed and needs to be replaced with a socialist system. The socialist message is very appealing to the masses of Uruguay who are currently having to deal with the fact that many of them have lost everything.\n\nThankfully, these are only protests, without violence. This shows that although the socialist message is appealing now, they understand that if they made a mistake, like causing political violence, they would fail to gain any major support or legitimacy."
urg.10.a:0 "At least it was peaceful."
urg.11.t:0 "Anti-Carlés Rally Held"
urg.11.d:0 "A rally has been held in Montevideo, protesting the new leadership of Argentina following the Christmas Coup, bringing Carlés to power. The message of the Montevideo protest is that although Argentina has fallen to a violent dictator, the people of Uruguay will defend their democracy with their lives. The people of Montevideo also fear that with Carlés coming to power, the safety and independence of Uruguay could be threatened by Argentina. Whatever happens in the future, we must try to keep our democracy strong."
urg.11.a:0 "Liberty or Death!"
urg.12.t:0 "The New Presidency"
urg.12.d:0 "With the leadership of the National Administration Council coming to an end, the power of the president is back. The council was slow and inefficient, and finally it has been torn down by those inside the government, in the form of a self-coup. Now, President Terra can begin to solve the issues that the council has left alone."
urg.12.a:0 "President Terra is now Head of State."
urg.13.t:0 "Uruguayan Neutrality Violated!"
urg.13.d:0 "Uruguay has not got involved in a war with another nation for many decades, and the people of Uruguay are proud of their neutrality. However, it seems this neutrality has been violated due to invasion from a foreign power. Now, the people of Uruguay are ready to fight to the death to defend their nation."
urg.13.a:0 "Uruguay will never fall!"
urg.15.t:0 "President Terra Meets with President Vargas"
urg.15.d:0 "President Terra recently had a meeting with Brazil's President Vargas, to discuss mutual trade and relations between the two nations. Vargas has become a controversial figure throughout South America, due to a recent coup he executed to give himself dictatorial powers in what he calls 'The New State'. However, it is important we keep our relationship with Brazil strong, for they are one of the main countries we export our food products to."

urg.27.d:0 "It is universally agreed on the council that the amount of welfare we were offering the people was far too much, which is why this crisis has caused such an issue. Therefore, we must now decide as to whether we still hold on to a large government involvement in peoples lives, or to whether we allow business to purchase some of our public services."

There are two main options: Gabriel Terra from the Colorado party, or Luis Alberto de Herrera of the Nacional party. However, there is a third, fringe candidate. After the Black Monday Crisis of 1936, the socialist party gained a lot of support from the peasant population.

And now, after winning the 1938 election easily, he has announced today that he will run again in 1942. This has come as a shock to many people, seeing Terra as attempting to cling on to power for as long as possible. Although it is technically legal, most people in Uruguay see it as time for a new president, and fear what might happen if Terra gets another four years. The Nacional Party have denounced the president following this, and the Colorado Party has called an emergency meeting of its national committee to discuss this sudden turn of events, for it seems even they were not ready for this. Terra, however, remains confident he will get another four years."

urg.34.d:0 "Two weeks after Terra's announcement that he will run again in 1942, the Colorado Party have now come out and said that they will not support him in his run, and will instead support his designated successor Juan de Amézaga. This has been met with outrage from Terra's office, but no official statement has been made by the president himself."

urg.35.t:0 "Terra Announces He Will End His Presidential Run"
urg.35.d:0 "In the wake of losing the support of the Colorado party, Terra has announced that he is ending his presidential run.

Immediately afterwards, there were mass protests across our country, the likes of which have not been seen since the Christmas Coup by Manuel Carlés in early 1936.

urg.41.t:0 "Terra Announces Emergency Press Act in Speech in Montevideo"
urg.41.d:0 "Terra has spoken outside the General Assembly building in Montevideo, talking about the start of his new reform program to 'defend the nation against the syndicalist menace'. The first thing he has proposed is the Emergency Press Act, which constitutes the limiting of public press activity in Uruguay. Many people in Uruguay seemed to have taken well to the act, echoing what Terra says about its necessity to protect the nation from radicalism and syndicalism. However, newspapers have come out aggressively against this, stating that it is 'more of a threat to Uruguayan democracy than radical neighbouring nations'. Voting on the Act will take place in the General Assembly soon."
urg.41.a:0 "Maybe it is what is needed."
urg.42.t:0 "March against Terra Turns Violent"
urg.42.d:0 "A mass protest in Montevideo, attended by thousands of socialist, syndicalists and liberals, turned violent when police had rocks thrown at them by socialists. This lead to a clash between the socialists and the police, with much violence. After an hour the protesters backed down, but the clash lead to the injuries of 12 police officers, 9 innocent civilians and tens of protesters. The PSU has distanced themselves from the violence, stating that the message of the protest was plagued by violence which they did not condone."

Just the other day, right here in our capital city, dangerous socialists came to the streets and attacked, leading to the injuries of not only loyal citizens but also to our police force. This is only the beginning of socialist violence, unless I can protect the people from the syndicalist menace.'\n\nTerra held a rousing speech this morning following the protest the other day. It was watched by a massive crowd outside the General Assembly building, hours before the vote on his Emergency Press Act is held. It is believed that he has enough votes to pass the bill, but it could still fail in the General Assembly should these predictions be wrong."

urg.44.t:0 "Terra Proposes Modifying the Constitution"
urg.44.d:0 "Terra has proposed that the constitution be altered slightly for the current situation, giving the president far more power than he currently holds, and allowing him to bypass the General Assembly if the nation is 'under threat'. He has moved far quicker on this than he did on his Emergency Press Act, trying to get this past the people of Uruguay quickly so as not to produce much backlash. The news has been banned from reporting on this in any major way, downplaying the significance of this if it does not go unquestioned by the General Assembly. Although some in the General Assembly have opposed this, many have claimed that it is necessary to protect Uruguay from the dangers of syndicalism."

urg.45.t:0 "Anti-Terra Riot in Montevideo and Other Large Cities"
urg.45.d:0 "A large riot has taken place in Montevideo today, against the rule of Gabriel Terra. Thousands have taken to the streets across the nation in anger of Terra’s successful attempts to seize more power in the government. Police have tried to keep order, and in some places army garrisons have had to be called in to put down some of the riots. By the time the riots had been put down, hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage had been done, hundreds had been injured and there was even 3 deaths. This signifies one of the first times in years there is such political violence.\n\nTerra has responded to the riots, saying that it is time someone restored order to Uruguay. He claims that the 'socialist' rioters are out to destroy Uruguay and turn it into a syndicalist state, leading to mass purges and more violence. Many other politicians, primarily from the Partido Nacional, are echoing Terra’s rhetoric, claiming it is time for the socialist violence to end."

Many politicians and military leaders have rallied behind him in what many have seen as a self-coup to destroy democracy and to make Terra president for life. There is much resistance to Terra’s self-coup, mainly from Terra’s own party, the Partido Colorado. The question is, will Terra’s self-coup succeed, or will rival politicians be able to restore order in Montevideo?"

I call for the National Party to stop aiding him, and I call to everyone in Uruguay to stand up and refuse to work in this dictatorship.'\n\nLuis Batlle Berres, a prominent figure in the Colorado Party, said this today in a speech in Montevideo to hundreds of Colorado supporters. This follows many people in the party denouncing Terra’s continued leadership, and there have been calls from many people, mostly socialists or Batllistas, for Terra to step down and restore democracy. The Nacional Party, who have been working and supporting Terra’s dictatorship, have not responded to Luis Batlle’s speech."

It appears to be a protest to the leadership of Gabriel Terra. The strike was set up by Emilio Frugoni of the Socialist Party, with organisational help from the syndicalist Paulina Luisi. So far there has not been any violence, but some strikers have stated that this strike will go on for days, even weeks if need be."

He shot 3 times into the crowd of protestors, injuring 2 people and hitting one man in the neck, killing him instantly. The shots echoed through the streets of Melo. There was mass panic, leading to another 3 people being injured. Emilio Frugoni has denounced the actions of the police, claiming they are 'just as corrupt as Terra himself'. However, the event seemed to have scared off the strikers, for the strike was called off the next day."

urg.55.t:0 "Emilio Frugoni Arrested."
urg.55.d:0 "Leader of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, Emilio Frugoni, has been arrested today by the Montevideo police. He was being investigated due to his dangerous links to socialism, but remained active in anti-Terra activity. A few days ago, under the new anti-syndicalism laws, multiple men were arrested with links to both the PSU and the PSiU, who were rather close with Frugoni. After a few days of questioning, it was discovered that the socialists, lead by the widely popular Frugoni, were going to attempt to overthrow the Terra regime in a revolution. Thankfully, we were able to discover this plot early on, before anything could come of it. Without Frugoni leading the PSU, they are sure to lose much popularity."

First of all, we have to hope that a friandly government to us comes out on top of the war, and we also have to hope that whoever comes out on top of the civil war will be friendly towards us.

Though President Emiliano Frugoni has tried to stave off the radical Totalism of José Lazarraga or the feminist Anarcha-Syndicalism of Paulina Luisi, their appeal and influence have only grown as Socialism becomes more accepted in our state. \n\nEmboldened by recent legislative successes and with masses of supporters at their backs, the radical Leftist of the Unión Revolucionaria Uruguaya under José Lazarraga and the Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay of Paulina Luisi have attempted a coup against our democratically elected government. With army forces split between the two groups, factionalism and chaos have spread, with the opportunist and notable populist strongman Gabriel Terra also amassing his forces to attempt to capitalize on the chaos. With the nation in turmoil and with the capital alight with gunfire, the future of Uruguay hangs in the balance."

The Buró Nacional Revolucionario shall serve as the Vanguard and protectors of the Revolution as the UNU moves to create a Socialist system built around national patriotism, communization, collectivization, and nationalized economics. Supported by both the Internationale and the Bolsheviks of Russia, our new People’s Republic shall be the red envy of South America as we work to build a crimson paradise here on the eastern shores of our beautiful and wondrous continent."

Seeking to cooperate with the old regime - particularly the Colorados and the Partido Socialista - while crushing radicalism and extremism in all its forms, President Luisi seeks to build an egalitarian worker’s paradise supported by unionism, feminism, and rapprochement with non-Socialist groups. Claiming that only if all in the nation are respected and treated as total equals in both the eyes of society and the government can our nation ever reach its peak potential, the Anarcha-Syndicalists of the PSiU seek to build a fair and free crimson utopia where all voices have an equal say and a fair shot at prosperity. Though the Totalist vanguard sees her as a Revolutionary Traitor while the republican and nationalist elements view her as a radical, all those close to President Luisi know that she truly seeks to build a better, more stable, and more equal Syndicalist union above all other pursuits, and with her Internationale allies at her side, she is determined to achieve this red dream."

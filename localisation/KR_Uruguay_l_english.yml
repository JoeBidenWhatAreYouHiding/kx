### Leaders ###
POLITICS_URG_CNA_DESC:0 "With the 1917 constitutional referendum and a constituent assembly in 1918, a new constitution was enacted in 1919 by President Baltasar Brum, which stated that the executive power has to be shared between the President of the Republic and the 'Consejo Nacional de Administracion' ('National administration Council'). The council is made by nine members that are elected every six years, which generally are six from the ruling party and three from the opposition. The role of the president belongs to the council candidate with the most votes, but he can be only responsible for Foreign Affairs, National Security and Agriculture, whereas the NCA is responsible for the rest of the executive branch responsibilities."
POLITICS_GABRIEL_TERRA_DESC:0 "José Luis Gabriel Terra was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated as a lawyer in 1895, where he later became a minister for President Claudio Willman, where he proved great expertise in economic and diplomatic affairs. Later on, he became one of the members of the Constituent Assembly in 1917 and was a minister during Baltasar Brum's rule. He is affiliated to the Partido Colorado, although he has proven to have opposing views with the leader of the party, Jose Battle Ordóñez. He's a known conservative and authoritarian, and now that he rules Uruguay, he'll try to centralize his power, balance the state's budget and avoid liberal and progressive reforms."
POLITICS_ALFREDO_FERRARI_DESC:0 "Alfredo Baldomir Ferrari was born in 1884, in the small town of Paysandú. He graduated from the Military academy in 1905, and later on he studied to become an architect, alternating between his two careers until reaching the rank of general in 1935. Now he's been named military governor of Uruguay, and while he has shown leniency towards his rebellious citizens, he still has to maintain order in the country, and will suppress any group that might dare disturb it."
POLITICS_EMILIO_FRUGONI_DESC:0 "Emilio Frugoni Queirolo was born in 1880, in Montevideo. He was already a political activist when he was in high school, and took part in the 1904 civil war defending the government of José Battle y Ordoñez. When the war was over, he formed the 'Centro Obrero Socialista' which would start the process of creating the 'Partido Socialista de Uruguay' in 1910, with Frugoni as its general secretary. He became deputy for that party in 1916 and 1920, however, with the fall of Britain and France to syndicalism, many of his party became to radicalize, turning his party into the 'Partido Sindicalista de Uruguay', whose advocation of violence forced Frugoni to leave the party he created, and has since then been rebuilding the Uruguayan Socialist Party.\n\nIn his words, 'Socialism is not violence, nor dispossession, nor redistribution', and now that he is in power, he shall respect the Uruguayan constitution and political system while at the same time trying to peacefully lead it to the revolutionary ideals he champions."
POLITICS_PAULINA_LUISI_DESC:0 "Paulina Luisi Janicki was born in 1875, in Colón, Entre Rios Province, Argentina. Born to an Italian father and polish mother, they moved shortly after to Paysandú and then finally settled in Montevideo in 1887. She became the first Uruguayan woman to study medicine when she began her career in the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1900, where she graduated as a physician in 1908.\n\nShe affiliated the Partido Socialista de Uruguay when it was founded in 1910, where she found the place to fight for cultural and civil rights for women in a political platform, and then went on to create the 'Consejo Nacional de la Mujer Uruguaya' and the 'Alianza Uruguaya de Mujeres' in 1919. She later went on to France to specialize in Dermatology and venereal diseases. She then witnessed the events of the French Syndicalist revolution herself, which inspired her to take those ideals back to Uruguay. Now that she is in power, she plans to follow the example of her European Comrades."
POLITICS_JUAQIN_ILLA_DESC:0 "Joaquin Secco Illa was born in 1879, in Montevideo. He graduated the 'Universidad de la Republica' as a Lawyer and was designated professor of civil rights of that university in 1906. He formed the 'Union Civica del Uruguay' in 1912 as a Christian democrat party, but rejoined with the 'Blanco Party' later on. A known conservative and Christian, now that he sits in the Palacio Estevez, he shall lead Uruguay prioritizing Christian values and stability over progress."
POLITICS_LUIS_ALBERTO_DE_HERRERA_DESC:0 "Luis Alberto de Herrera y Quevedo was born in 1873, in Montevideo. He graduated with a doctorate in Law and Social sciences from the 'Universidad de la Republica'. He participated in the 1897 revolution by the Partido Blanco in and left for the US in 1901, where he served as ambassador for Uruguay. In 1920 he was chosen as director of the Partido Nacional and was the president of the CNA from 1925 to 1927.\n\nWhile his reputation is far from perfect, with multiple conflicts with more radical and progressive factions within the PN, he has proven in the past that he has a genuine concern for the well-being of the Uruguayan citizens and workers. Now that he leads Uruguay, he shall focus on reducing government intervention on the economy, improving the agrarian economy instead of industrializing Uruguay and, inspired by Alexis de Tocqueville's writings, increase the local autonomy of each city and town within Uruguay."
POLITICS_LUIZ_CONRADO_BATLLE_BERRES_DESC:0 "Luis Conrado Battle Berres was born in 1897, in Montevideo. He became an orphan when he was eleven, and went to live with his uncle, Jose Battle y Ordoñez. While he was living with his uncle, Jose managed to become president of Uruguay, and inspired Luis to sign up in the 'Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de la Republica', where he graduated as a lawyer and joined the Partido Colorado, and thanks to his uncle's connections, has remained a popular choice in the party as a deputy, and now even managing to become a presidential candidate.\n\nDespite his young age and inexperience, the legacy of his uncle, which many regard with having transformed Uruguay into the 'Switzerland of South America', is still alive in the memory of many Uruguayans. As his uncle, he'll champion the ideals of his new 'Batllismo', an interventionist state which shall guarantee social plans for the poor and progressive reforms for the disenfranchised."
POLITICS_JUAN_DE_AMEZAGA_DESC:0 "Juan Jose de Amézaga Landaraso was born in 1881, in Montevideo. He graduated as a Lawyer from the 'Universidad de la Republica' in 1905, and travelled for a year and half between Germany and France. His experience in Europe brought him closer to the ideals of Batllismo, and joined up the Colorado Party as soon as he had returned. He became a deputy for the town of Durazno in 1908 with only twenty-seven years, receiving praise and support from Jose Battle y Ordoñez himself. He has since then climbed through the ranks and now that he sits in the Palacio Estévez, he's bound to continue the old Batllist policies."

URG_continue_council_rule_desc:0 "With Baltasar Brum and his reform in 1918, our country finally reached the end of an almost century old dispute between the 'Blancos' and 'Colorados'. This ushered in the prosperity that came afterwards, and it would be foolish to end this system because of a worldwide catastrophe and risk going back to the times of constant brawling between our factions."
URG_promote_political_stability:0 "Promote Political Stability"
URG_promote_political_stability_desc:0 "Uruguay is no stranger to political instability. For almost a century the conflict of 'Blancos' and 'Colorados' almost tore apart our nation more than once. With the council, however, we've managed to unite both parties, who now both try their best to cooperate and lead us to a better future. We shall encourage this harmony, and make all those who strive for compromise and cooperation exemplary citizens."
URG_encourage_political_confidence:0 "Ensure Political Confidence"
URG_encourage_political_confidence_desc:0 "The people of Uruguay have a choice in the elections. However, many people still do not vote, believing they will not have any effect on the result, or not even knowing about the election at all! We should try to promote confidence in the political game, to encourage stability."
URG_power_to_the_council:0 "Expand the Council's Authority"
URG_power_to_the_council_desc:0 "Now that we're done dealing with the crisis, we can go back to issues we had before it.

URG_restore_presidentialism_desc:0 "Ever since Baltasar Brum's presidency, the president was sidelined and the real power was held by the council.

URG_expand_presidents_power:0 "Expand the Presidency"

URG_encourage_political_participation:0 "Encourage Political Participation"
URG_encourage_political_participation_desc:0 "One of the major fears with the loss of the council is the lack of representation for opposing parties.

URG_compromise_between_sides:0 "The Politics of Consensus"
URG_compromise_between_sides_desc:0 "Uruguay shall not be built by one single group, or one single party.

Time will tell however if his hardline pacifism will truly work to reform Uruguay..."

URG_improve_workers_rights_desc:0 "One of our main pool of support are the industrial workers of Uruguay, who, while not great in number as our neighbour Argentina has, are still a huge part of the Uruguayan society as a whole.

URG_support_trade_unions:0 "Support Trade Unions"
URG_support_trade_unions_desc:0 "The Trade Unions of Uruguay have played a huge role in our victory, and we shouldn't underestimate their influence. However, they are also extremely vulnerable to radicalize and start heeding the violent revolutionary call of the PSiU, and in order to avoid it, we should woo them to our side by granting them concessions to make sure they won't hinder our reforms."

URG_temporary_tax_increases_desc:0 "During the Welfare State, not only did the state provided social benefits, but it also tried to keep taxes at a minimum.

URG_education_desc:0 "Despite having a good education system compared to the South American standards, it's still not good enough compared to other places in the world, such as Europe.

URG_maintain_agriculture_desc:0 "Uruguay is not a big nation, and because of that, we can't have a powerful industry such as Germany. Mantaining agrarianism is our only choice to remain competitive on the global markets, whether we like it or not."

URG_commission_new_equipment_designs:0 "Modernised Weapon Training Programs"
URG_commission_new_equipment_designs_desc:0 "Modern equipment will perform a key role in the modernization of our tactics, considering how new artillery pieces are more accurate than the ancient ones, and new shells are more powerful than before.

URG_subsidise_local_munitions_facilities_desc:0 "We can't just rely on imports, considering how easily we can be blockaded by any other nation, and that means domestic production is a must. We should subsidize domestic production in order to be prepared for anything we could potentially face."

URG_air_corps_desc:0 "The state of Uruguay's aviation is nonexistant, and we need to kickstart it in a way or another.

URG_air_not_independent:0 "Integrate the Air Command"

URG_independent_air_force:0 "Develop an Independent Air Force"
URG_independent_air_force_desc:0 "The air force cannot be tied to the army, considering its multiple roles and capabilities, and it should become its own independent branch, along with the army and the navy."
URG_anti_air:0 "Anti-Air Defences"
URG_anti_air_desc:0 "Anti-air is a type of weapon that can make wonders, if used properly, especially against bombers which could maul our troops and destroy our factories, and our homes. Creating an anti-air defence system will ensure that enemy bombers won't be able to menace us."

### Events ###
urg.1.t:0 "The Oriental Republic of Uruguay"
urg.1.d:0 "The oriental republic of Uruguay has, for most of its history, been deeply divided. Even after the end of the Uruguayan Civil War, there was still strong civil unrest between the two main political parties, the Colorado and the National party. No middle ground could be found, and the division seemed to have no end, but the nation was still functional. When the first Weltkrieg struck the world, Uruguay remained neutral, for both Germany and Great Britain were important trading partners. Although Uruguay was able to keep trade going throughout the conflict, the war did not have a major impact on the nation, and Uruguay continued to exist as a weak and unstable nation. That was, however, until 1919, when a new constitution was created and agreed upon by both parties. The constitution allows the Colorado party to keep the role of president, but it would have its powers limited and shared with the National Administration Council, made up of elected representatives of both the Colorado and National party. This balance of power has ushered in a golden age for Uruguay, bringing peace and stability to the population. The council had its powers extended even further in 1928, to the point where it's more influential than the president. The council has become fundamental in Uruguayan politics. Due to this political golden age, the economy has improved drastically, allowing the government the ability to establish Uruguay as a strong welfare state. However, the politics of Uruguay are just as volatile as always. Should disaster strike, like the sudden collapse of the agricultural industry, the cracks in the council might begin to show, and some politicians who believe the president must have more power might try and use this as an opportunity to bring an end to the Council's rule."
urg.1.a:0 "Libertad o Muerte!"
urg.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits the River Plate!"
urg.2.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, we exported tonnes of foodstuff and cattle products to all sides, mostly to both the United Kingdom and Germany. This continued even after the Weltkrieg up until the 1925 revolution in Britain, when our exports to the British ended almost entirely. Ever since then our economy has grown more and more dependent on Germany's. This benefited us due to the strength of the German economy, bringing years of constant economic growth.\n\nSuddenly, however, our economy has stagnated. Businesses have began to close due to ripples of the Black Monday crisis. Thankfully, our two main trading partners, Germany and Brazil, have continued to import our food stocks and other exports. However, many economists fear that Germany will be forced to end their imports, which will bring a full national crisis.\n\nFor now, it seems the Uruguayan golden age is over."
urg.2.a:0 "Oh no!"
urg.3.t:0 "Farming Exports Collapse!"
urg.3.d:0 "It seems our fears have become reality. Due to the Black Monday economic crash, Germany has been forced to terminate most of our trade deals. Farmers across the nation now have produced far too much grain and cattle products with no one to buy them. This has lead to farm owners having to sell at extremely low prices or just destroy their leftover stock. Thousands of people have lost their jobs, because the farm owners cannot afford to employ any workers any more. It seems what was originally an initial economic downturn has become a national crisis."
urg.3.a:0 "Disaster!"
urg.4.t:0 "Deepened Political Crisis"
urg.4.d:0 "Since the start of the Black Monday crisis, any idea of political co-operation has gone out the window. People throughout the nation are losing faith in our government, and riots are occurring in the cities. Suddenly, more extremist ideologies are beginning to gain an audience with the population, where most people have lost everything. The socialist rebellion that occurred in Argentina could happen here too. If we do not start dealing with these issues, we could lose control of our nation. However, there are doubts as to whether the government is strong enough to change anything."
urg.4.a:0 "Worrisome."
urg.5.t:0 "The Council Begins Deliberations on Solutions"
urg.5.d:0 "The National Administration Council have finally met up to try to discuss solutions on the economic and political problems facing Uruguay. The council have only just started discussing solutions on these issues, even though the initial crash occurred weeks ago. One of the main criticisms of the council is the fact that it has taken so long for the government to even begin to try to solve the economic issues. Critics argue that the crash may not have been as bad had the council been able to respond faster to the problem. However, this is not the fault of any one person in the government, but rather the government structure as a whole. The council cannot react quickly to problems because of the need to discuss these issues for many weeks before finally reaching a conclusion. Some politicians currently serving on the council fear that it is too late, and that the council is on deaths door."
urg.5.a:0 "Why must they take so long?"
urg.6.t:0 "The Council is called into question!"
urg.6.d:0 "After the council announced a week ago that they would begin working on solutions, it did not seem to quell the criticisms of the government, but made these criticisms even louder. The loudest critic of the council is President Gabriel Terra of the Colorado party, who states that the council might be effective in times of peace and order, but in times of disaster, a powerful president is necessary to react to problems as they come, rather than waiting to discuss it with the other side. President Terra has stated that it is time for the council to die, and now we must make the decision. Should we maintain the council, or is it time for a strong president once more?"
urg.6.a:0 "Maintain the Council."
urg.6.b:0 "Abolish the Council."
urg.7.t:0 "Council Maintained"
urg.7.d:0 "Even with the anarchy and criticisms against the National Administration Council, we continued the rule of the council, and it seems this has paid off. The violence on the streets has decreased back to ordinary levels, for faith in the government is increasing again. The people now trust that the Council will be able to make the right choices for Uruguay, even if it takes longer than a president would."
urg.7.a:0 "Our Democracy Is Strong!"
urg.8.t:0 "Anti-Syndicalist Pact with Paraguay"
urg.8.d:0 "It appears some of our greatest fears have become a reality. The Syndicalists of Patagonia have successfully beaten the Argentinean army and have taken over the country. Suddenly, we have neighbours who are ideologically different to us, and have shown that they are prepared to fight for their beliefs. We should now be trying the find as many allies as we can, and our best choice is probably a nation in the exact same situation as us; Paraguay. Although in the past we have had our disagreements, now is not the time to dwell on history.\n\nMany people in our government agree it is time to approach Paraguay about plans for a mutual defence pact between us."
urg.8.a:0 "Approach Paraguay."
urg.8.b:0 "We can stand alone."
urg.9.t:0 "The Argentinean Navy Joins Us"
urg.9.d:0 "In the wake of Argentina being overrun by syndicalist rebels, the Argentinean navy deserted their old commanders and requested that they dock in our ports, which our naval leaders allowed. They have decided that now that Argentina has fallen to syndicalism, they would rather fight for us and stay safe in our docks."
urg.9.a:0 "We will keep them safe."
urg.10.t:0 "Socialist Protests Throughout the Nation"
urg.10.d:0 "Due to the economic crash that is affecting the nation, the popularity of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, the main socialist party of Uruguay, has increased dramatically, and have organised protests throughout the nation. They are using the failure of the government to deal with this crash as proof that the council is flawed and needs to be replaced with a socialist system. The socialist message is very appealing to the masses of Uruguay who are currently having to deal with the fact that many of them have lost everything.\n\nThankfully, these are only protests, without violence. This shows that although the socialist message is appealing now, they understand that if they made a mistake, like causing political violence, they would fail to gain any major support or legitimacy."
urg.10.a:0 "At least it was peaceful."
urg.11.t:0 "Anti-Carlés Rally Held"
urg.11.d:0 "A rally has been held in Montevideo, protesting the new leadership of Argentina following the Christmas Coup, bringing Carlés to power. The message of the Montevideo protest is that although Argentina has fallen to a violent dictator, the people of Uruguay will defend their democracy with their lives. The people of Montevideo also fear that with Carlés coming to power, the safety and independence of Uruguay could be threatened by Argentina. Whatever happens in the future, we must try to keep our democracy strong."
urg.11.a:0 "Liberty or Death!"
urg.12.t:0 "The New Presidency"
urg.12.d:0 "With the leadership of the National Administration Council coming to an end, the power of the president is back. The council was slow and inefficient, and finally it has been torn down by those inside the government, in the form of a self-coup. Now, President Terra can begin to solve the issues that the council has left alone."
urg.12.a:0 "President Terra is now Head of State."
urg.13.t:0 "Uruguayan Neutrality Violated!"
urg.13.d:0 "Uruguay has not got involved in a war with another nation for many decades, and the people of Uruguay are proud of their neutrality. However, it seems this neutrality has been violated due to invasion from a foreign power. Now, the people of Uruguay are ready to fight to the death to defend their nation."
urg.13.a:0 "Uruguay will never fall!"
urg.15.t:0 "President Terra Meets with President Vargas"
urg.15.d:0 "President Terra recently had a meeting with Brazil's President Vargas, to discuss mutual trade and relations between the two nations. Vargas has become a controversial figure throughout South America, due to a recent coup he executed to give himself dictatorial powers in what he calls 'The New State'. However, it is important we keep our relationship with Brazil strong, for they are one of the main countries we export our food products to."
urg.15.a:0 "Hopefully Terra doesn't get any ideas..."
urg.16.t:0 "Pax Uruguaia"
urg.16.d:0 "Once again, the world has fallen to war. The horros of the first Weltkrieg are repeating themselves in Europe, and even here on our own continent, war ravages the people. And yet, we in Uruguay are at peace. The fact that we have remained peaceful for so long, even when surrounded by outside threats, brings joy and confidence to the Uruguayan peoples."

urg.17.t:0 "Anti-Syndicalist Pact with Uruguay?"
urg.17.d:0 "Leaders of Uruguay have come to us with the proposal that we enter a pact of mutual defence. This is due to the fact that the Syndicalist menace is now right on our doorstep, and we both stand in the firing line. In these times of need, maybe having an ally would be beneficial to us."
urg.17.a:0 "Agree to the pact."
urg.17.b:0 "We need no allies."
urg.18.t:0 "Paraguay Agrees to the Pact"
urg.18.d:0 "Paraguay have responded with agreeing with the Anti-Syndicalist pact. Now, if one of us gets attacked, the other can step in and help them."
urg.18.a:0 "It's good to have friend in this dangerous time."
urg.19.t:0 "Paraguay Have Refused the Pact"
urg.19.d:0 "Paraguay have refused our offer to join us in a mutual defence treaty in the face of the Syndicalist menace. It is possible now the syndicalists can divide and conquer, and we can do nothing to help."
urg.19.a:0 "We are on our own."
urg.20.t:0 "1938 Council Elections"
urg.20.d:0 "With the council keeping power throughout the crisis of 1936, it is time for the national council elections. Once again the main two parties are represented; the Colorado party and the Nacional party, and they are the main two options. However, if neither of the parties secure a majority in the council, the parties will have to act moderately and work together in a balanced council."
urg.20.a:0 "Slight Colorado Victory."
urg.20.b:0 "A Balanced approach."

urg.21.t:0 "[GetYear] Council Elections"
urg.21.d:0 "Once again it is time for elections in the National Administration Council. Again, the two options are the Colorado Party or the Nacional Party, which may or may not be able to secure a majority in the Council. If neither get a majority, it will have to be a balanced council."
urg.21.a:0 "Slight Colorado victory."
urg.21.b:0 "A balanced approach."
urg.21.c:0 "Slight Nacional victory."
urg.25.t:0 "The council Must Decide What to Do"
urg.25.d:0 "The council has two choices as to the initial reaction to the crisis. Either we can push more government money into helping people who have lost their wealth, increasing public support massively, or we can focus our money on recovering the economy, not gaining as much public support but allowing our nation to begin to produce again."
urg.25.a:0 "Increase public support."
urg.25.b:0 "Focus funds on the economy."
urg.26.t:0 "Council's Decision: Tax"
urg.26.d:0 "The council must now decide on a tax policy. After some deliberations, there are two main options we can follow. Either we can implement a massive tax increase on all levels to try to get money to fund our future efforts, or we could increase taxes to a lesser degree, and not increase the taxes of the very poorest."
urg.26.a:0 "High Tax Increases."
urg.26.b:0 "Moderate Tax Increases."
urg.27.t:0 "Council's Decision: Size of the Government"
urg.27.d:0 "It is universally agreed on the council that the amount of welfare we were offering the people was far too much, which is why this crisis has caused such an issue. Therefore, we must now decide as to whether we still hold on to a large government involvement in peoples lives, or to whether we allow business to purchase some of our public services."
urg.27.a:0 "Keep high government involvement."
urg.27.b:0 "Allow businesses to purchase government services."
urg.28.t:0 "Council's Decision: Recovery Plan"
urg.28.d:0 "The council must now decide on a further recovery plan. Either we can fund the construction industry, allowing the building of more factories, or we can give government funding to industrial businesses already working in Uruguay, allowing them to employ more people and increase their production to almost pre-crisis levels."
urg.28.a:0 "Fund construction industries."
urg.28.b:0 "Fund pre-existing businesses."
urg.29.t:0 "Council's Decision: Farmer"
urg.29.d:0 "The final issue the council is meeting on is its policy on farm owners. In this state of emergency, we can choose to seize farmland from farmers who are not getting much profit from the land. However, we can also fund these farmers to encourage them to try to get more profits."
urg.29.a:0 "Seize non-profitable farmland."
urg.29.b:0 "Fund non-profitable farmers."
urg.30.t:0 "1938 Presidential Election"
urg.30.d:0 "After Gabriel Terra's self-coup against the council succeeded in 1936, the elections that he promised are now taking place. There are two main options: Gabriel Terra from the Colorado party, or Luis Alberto de Herrera of the Nacional party. However, there is a third, fringe candidate. After the Black Monday Crisis of 1936, the socialist party gained a lot of support from the peasant population. Their candidate, Emilio Frugoni, is up for election, though if he were elected it would be a shocking surprise."
urg.30.a:0 "Victory for Gabriel Terra."

For the Colorado party the candidate is Juan de Amézaga, after Gabriel Terra failed to win the Colorado candidacy. For the Nacional party, the candidate is Jose Luis Finocchetti, for Luis Alberto de Herrera decided to not run again."
urg.31.a:0 "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."

urg.31.c:0 "Victory for Emilio Frugoni."

urg.32.a:0 "Victory for Juan de Amézaga."
urg.32.b:0 "Victory for Jose Luis Finocchetti."
urg.33.t:0 "Terra Announces He Will Run Again in 1942"
urg.33.d:0 "Gabriel Terra has been the head of the nation since 1936, when he performed his self-coup against the National Administration Council during the worst of the black Monday crisis. And now, after winning the 1938 election easily, he has announced today that he will run again in 1942. This has come as a shock to many people, seeing Terra as attempting to cling on to power for as long as possible. Although it is technically legal, most people in Uruguay see it as time for a new president, and fear what might happen if Terra gets another four years. The Nacional Party have denounced the president following this, and the Colorado Party has called an emergency meeting of its national committee to discuss this sudden turn of events, for it seems even they were not ready for this. Terra, however, remains confident he will get another four years."
urg.33.a:0 "It is legal..."
urg.34.t:0 "Terra Loses Support of the Colorado Party"
urg.34.d:0 "Two weeks after Terra's announcement that he will run again in 1942, the Colorado Party have now come out and said that they will not support him in his run, and will instead support his designated successor Juan de Amézaga. This has been met with outrage from Terra's office, but no official statement has been made by the president himself."
urg.34.a:0 "Will Terra have the support?"
urg.35.t:0 "Terra Announces He Will End His Presidential Run"
urg.35.d:0 "In the wake of losing the support of the Colorado party, Terra has announced that he is ending his presidential run. He has said that although he wants to continue his run, he has decided to put the nation and his party first. He has, however, refused to give his support for Amézaga, even claiming that he will be a 'weak successor'."
urg.35.a:0 "This is for the best."
urg.36.t:0 "Fears about Syndicalist Victory in Argentina"
urg.36.d:0 "It appears one of the greatest fears of the nation has become a reality. Syndicalist forces have taken over Argentina and have already started to implement radically socialist reforms over their nation. Immediately afterwards, there were mass protests across our country, the likes of which have not been seen since the Christmas Coup by Manuel Carlés in early 1936. Many people in the country fear that the Syndicalism of our neighbour will spread over to our democracy, and that our borders are not safe from the syndicalist menace."

And although we should be wary of their influence and aggression, a full anti-syndicalist approach is by no means the way forward. We should continue to strive for neutrality and friendly relations with our neighbours, and should remember to avoid dangerous demagogues who threaten democracy and the Uruguayan people.'\n\nFrugoni’s speech was seen by hundreds of people in the street of Montevideo, and it has been published in newspapers across the country.

urg.40.t:0 "Gabriel Terra Speaks to the General Assembly"
urg.40.d:0 "The President of Uruguay, Gabriel Terra, has spoken to the General Assembly of Uruguay about the dangers of syndicalism. He has stated that over the coming weeks he will move to try to reform Uruguay to the modern day, stating that our current society is vulnerable to syndicalist propaganda and is in need of urgent change, or Montevideo will fall to the socialism and syndicalism that we all fear."
urg.40.a:0 "it is a true fear."
urg.41.t:0 "Terra Announces Emergency Press Act in Speech in Montevideo"
urg.41.d:0 "Terra has spoken outside the General Assembly building in Montevideo, talking about the start of his new reform program to 'defend the nation against the syndicalist menace'. The first thing he has proposed is the Emergency Press Act, which constitutes the limiting of public press activity in Uruguay. Many people in Uruguay seemed to have taken well to the act, echoing what Terra says about its necessity to protect the nation from radicalism and syndicalism. However, newspapers have come out aggressively against this, stating that it is 'more of a threat to Uruguayan democracy than radical neighbouring nations'. Voting on the Act will take place in the General Assembly soon."
urg.41.a:0 "Maybe it is what is needed."
urg.42.t:0 "March against Terra Turns Violent"
urg.42.d:0 "A mass protest in Montevideo, attended by thousands of socialist, syndicalists and liberals, turned violent when police had rocks thrown at them by socialists. This lead to a clash between the socialists and the police, with much violence. After an hour the protesters backed down, but the clash lead to the injuries of 12 police officers, 9 innocent civilians and tens of protesters. The PSU has distanced themselves from the violence, stating that the message of the protest was plagued by violence which they did not condone."
urg.42.a:0 "I thought we were better than this?"
urg.43.t:0 "Terra Holds Speech on the Morning of the Emergency Press Act Vote"
urg.43.d:0 "'Our nation is under threat! We cannot stand idle while chaos consumes the people, and threatens the hard working citizens of Uruguay. Just the other day, right here in our capital city, dangerous socialists came to the streets and attacked, leading to the injuries of not only loyal citizens but also to our police force. This is only the beginning of socialist violence, unless I can protect the people from the syndicalist menace.'\n\nTerra held a rousing speech this morning following the protest the other day. It was watched by a massive crowd outside the General Assembly building, hours before the vote on his Emergency Press Act is held. It is believed that he has enough votes to pass the bill, but it could still fail in the General Assembly should these predictions be wrong."
urg.43.a:0 "The Emergency Press Act passes!"
urg.43.b:0 "The Act fails on the General Assembly floor."
urg.44.t:0 "Terra Proposes Modifying the Constitution"
urg.44.d:0 "Terra has proposed that the constitution be altered slightly for the current situation, giving the president far more power than he currently holds, and allowing him to bypass the General Assembly if the nation is 'under threat'. He has moved far quicker on this than he did on his Emergency Press Act, trying to get this past the people of Uruguay quickly so as not to produce much backlash. The news has been banned from reporting on this in any major way, downplaying the significance of this if it does not go unquestioned by the General Assembly. Although some in the General Assembly have opposed this, many have claimed that it is necessary to protect Uruguay from the dangers of syndicalism."
urg.44.a:0 "The constitution is modified without a hitch."
urg.44.b:0 "The General Assembly steps in and stops him."
urg.45.t:0 "Anti-Terra Riot in Montevideo and Other Large Cities"
urg.45.d:0 "A large riot has taken place in Montevideo today, against the rule of Gabriel Terra. Thousands have taken to the streets across the nation in anger of Terra’s successful attempts to seize more power in the government. Police have tried to keep order, and in some places army garrisons have had to be called in to put down some of the riots. By the time the riots had been put down, hundreds of thousands of dollars of damage had been done, hundreds had been injured and there was even 3 deaths. This signifies one of the first times in years there is such political violence.\n\nTerra has responded to the riots, saying that it is time someone restored order to Uruguay. He claims that the 'socialist' rioters are out to destroy Uruguay and turn it into a syndicalist state, leading to mass purges and more violence. Many other politicians, primarily from the Partido Nacional, are echoing Terra’s rhetoric, claiming it is time for the socialist violence to end."
urg.45.a:0 "Order must be restored!"
urg.46.t:0 "Terra Moves to Suspend the Constitution Indefinitely"
urg.46.d:0 "Gabriel Terra has moved to bring an end to Uruguayan democracy it seems. Many politicians and military leaders have rallied behind him in what many have seen as a self-coup to destroy democracy and to make Terra president for life. There is much resistance to Terra’s self-coup, mainly from Terra’s own party, the Partido Colorado. The question is, will Terra’s self-coup succeed, or will rival politicians be able to restore order in Montevideo?"
urg.46.a:0 "Terra succeeds and becomes President for Life!"
urg.46.b:0 "Terra's self-coup fails, the Colorado Party replace him with Amézaga."
urg.47.t:0 "Luis Batlle Berres Denounces Terra’s new regime"
urg.47.d:0 "'A tyrant has taken over in Montevideo. Not only is Terra undemocratic, he is anti-liberal and anti-Uruguayan. We are moving into a time when our nation is ruled by a corrupt dictator, who will silence dissent, and destroy any sign that we are truly a republic in any way other than by name. I call for the National Party to stop aiding him, and I call to everyone in Uruguay to stand up and refuse to work in this dictatorship.'\n\nLuis Batlle Berres, a prominent figure in the Colorado Party, said this today in a speech in Montevideo to hundreds of Colorado supporters. This follows many people in the party denouncing Terra’s continued leadership, and there have been calls from many people, mostly socialists or Batllistas, for Terra to step down and restore democracy. The Nacional Party, who have been working and supporting Terra’s dictatorship, have not responded to Luis Batlle’s speech."
urg.47.a:0 "He will learn eventually."

urg.53.t:0 "Agricultural Strike"
urg.53.d:0 "Throughout the country, many agricultural workers have not gone to work today, and have instead marched in their villages, towns, and cities. It appears to be a protest to the leadership of Gabriel Terra. The strike was set up by Emilio Frugoni of the Socialist Party, with organisational help from the syndicalist Paulina Luisi. So far there has not been any violence, but some strikers have stated that this strike will go on for days, even weeks if need be."
urg.53.a:0 "Let's hope it doesn’t last too long."
urg.53.b:0 "The police can break them up!"
urg.54.t:0 "One Man Dead after Army Sent to End Protests in Melo"
urg.54.d:0 "After tensions continued to rise following the police moving in to end the strike, one police officer panicked. He shot 3 times into the crowd of protestors, injuring 2 people and hitting one man in the neck, killing him instantly. The shots echoed through the streets of Melo. There was mass panic, leading to another 3 people being injured. Emilio Frugoni has denounced the actions of the police, claiming they are 'just as corrupt as Terra himself'. However, the event seemed to have scared off the strikers, for the strike was called off the next day."
urg.54.a:0 "Our power is more secure than ever!"
urg.55.t:0 "Emilio Frugoni Arrested."
urg.55.d:0 "Leader of the Partido Socialista de Uruguay, Emilio Frugoni, has been arrested today by the Montevideo police. He was being investigated due to his dangerous links to socialism, but remained active in anti-Terra activity. A few days ago, under the new anti-syndicalism laws, multiple men were arrested with links to both the PSU and the PSiU, who were rather close with Frugoni. After a few days of questioning, it was discovered that the socialists, lead by the widely popular Frugoni, were going to attempt to overthrow the Terra regime in a revolution. Thankfully, we were able to discover this plot early on, before anything could come of it. Without Frugoni leading the PSU, they are sure to lose much popularity."
urg.55.a:0 "Excellent."

urg.60.d:0 "Since the Christmas Coup of 1935, sketchy and contradictory reports have emerged from Argentina regarding the status of its government. But now citizens in the South have been able to witness first hand sporadic fighting taking place in the Buenos Aires Capital region. Military observers and the navy have flocked to the area and began reconaissance to ascertain the exact situation."
urg.60.a:0 "Troubling."

urg.61.t:0 "The Future of the Rio-Montevideo Mission"
urg.61.d:0 "For a year, Brazillian military advisors have been working with our forces and high command though the lease on their services is set to expire. The Brazilian government has offered an extension of the military mission for another year though this is not an entirely charitable act. In exchange for continuing the lease they have requested a lump sum of monies be paid for their service though of course we could simple renege on this and end the mission."
urg.61.a:0 "Extend the lease!"
urg.61.b:0 "We can't afford it."

urg.62.t:0 "Brazil Collapses into civl war!"
urg.62.d:0 "Brazil, our northern naighbour, has collapsed in yet another civil war in less than 10 years, and this means trouble for us. First of all, we have to hope that a friandly government to us comes out on top of the war, and we also have to hope that whoever comes out on top of the civil war will be friendly towards us. Our small military can't intervene in a such large scale conflict, and the only thing we can do is be prepared for whatever will come."
urg.62.a:0 "Bugger."

urg.63.t:0 "Construction of the Dam"
urg.63.d:0 "With the construction of the Rincón del Bonete Dam our country will finally have access to a large swath of water, an artificial one, which will be incredibly helpful both for our agrarian economy and also as a source of electricity via hydroelectric production. This is truly a day worth remembering for our country."
urg.63.a:0 "Nice."

urg.64.t:0 "The Question of Argentine Aggression"
urg.64.d:0 "Argentina is looking very dangerous, and we could approach the government in Montevideo with a proposal: a mutual defence union between our nations in order to contain the Argentinean aggression. It's a risky move, but we're certain we will be able to convince our southern neighbours that we both can only get advantages from this."
urg.64.a:0 "Send the request."
urg.64.b:0 "Uruguay! How many divisions do they have?"

urg.65.t:0 "International Protection Achieved"
urg.65.d:0 "We have now joined Brazil's faction, and while this means that we will get dragged in any war our faction leader will get involved with, at least we have achieved international protection. Our own independence is guaranteed."
urg.65.a:0 "Very good."

urg.66.t:0 "The Formation of the Montevideo Treaty"
urg.66.d:0 "Today, in Montevideo, a formal agreement of mutual defence and assistance has been signed between [Root.GetLeader] and [BRA.GetLeader] in case of aggression from any foreign power.

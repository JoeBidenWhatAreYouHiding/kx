### Black Monday General Events ###
black.1.t: "This is not meant to be here!"
black.1.d: "If you see this please report on the paradox forums!"
black.1.a: "I'm serious REPORT IT!"
black.2.t: "Black Monday"
black.2.d: "On the third of February 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange stopped sinking - it plunged. Fuelled by the instability of the market panic, selling erupted as soon as the stock market opened on Monday morning.\n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."
black.2.a: "Mein Gott!"
black.3.t: "Black Monday"
black.3.d: "On the third of February 1936, the Berlin Stock Exchange stopped sinking - it plunged. Fuelled by the instability of the market panic, selling erupted as soon as the stock market opened on Monday morning.\n\nIt took well into the night for the teleprinters to stop sputtering out the results of what became known as Black Monday. When the results had been analysed, it was clear that the situation had only got worse.\n\nThe shock of this unprecedented economic catastrophe will, no doubt, be felt over the entire world. The German golden age has ended - for now, at least..."
black.3.a: "Mein Gott!"
black.3.b: "Marx predicted this day!"
black.4.t: "Run on the banks"
black.4.d: "German citizens, panicked by the collapse of the Berlin Stock Market, are rushing to make bank runs to withdraw their assets. The banks cannot afford to give out such sums and many are in danger of collapse. Many are clamouring for immediate government intervention to stabilise this unprecedented financial crisis!"
black.4.a: "Close the banks temporarily."
black.4.b: "Guarantee the holdings of private individuals."
black.4.c: "Do nothing."
black.5.t: "Black Week comes to an end"
black.5.d: "The situation hardly improved in the days following Black Monday, which was the start of what became known as Black Week. Panic-selling of stocks reached an all-time high as people tried to dump their stocks before they became worthless. When the Berlin Stock Market closed at the end of the week, the market was as dead as the 11 major economic experts and top executives in Germany that had committed suicide. The German government had to act."
black.5.a: "We must reform the economy."
black.6.t: "War Stimulates the Economy"
black.6.d: "Due to the war, industrial production across several sectors has skyrocketed and the workforce has endeavoured to fulfil their patriotic duty. This has had a net positive effect on the economy by reducing the aftermath of the Black Monday crash. It seems the economy is finally showing signs of life!"
black.6.a: "Excellent."
black.7.t: "Financial Troubles in the Colonies"
black.7.d: "Some maverick politicians proposed distributing more resources to the colonies to the detriment of the German national, which would obviously not be popular..."

black.7.c: "Tighten our belts. We can't help them in our dire times."
black.8.t: "Major Bank Declares Bankruptcy"

black.8.b: "Help our citizens!"
black.9.t: "Major Industrial Corporation Declares Bankruptcy"
black.9.d: "Today, because of the state of our economy a major industrial corporation has unfortunately declared bankruptcy today. Several factories are going to close all over the country."
black.9.a: "This is not good."
black.10.t: "The Kaiserreich Economic Policy"

black.10.b: "Invest in our colonies!"
black.10.c: "Invest in our sphere of influence!"

### Austria and Black Monday ###
black.200.t: "Black Monday hits Austria"

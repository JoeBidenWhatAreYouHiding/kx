### Leaders ###
POLITICS_OSVALDO_LIMA_GRP_DESC:0 "Osvaldo Cavalcanti da Costa Lima Filho was born in the town of Cabo de Santo Agostinho, is a young and energetic right wing radical and former member of the AIB. His political career began as early as 1936, where he partook in the street battles in Recife against syndicalist rabbles, and has since become one of the key agitators of Integralist ideology in the region. While he, like many integralists in the northeastern part of Brazil, never held any significant monarchist beliefs, the movement enjoyed his support as he saw the republic as little more than a failed experiment in its current state. Being a law graduate, Osvaldo wishes to re-establish the rule of law cross the Confederation; and to do so, he prepares an extensive plan of investigations and arrests against traitors and terrorists, some of whom have roamed the nation freely for decades. To this end, he is organizing a reformed secret police department, backed by the remnants of integralist militias, whose members still remember their faith and duty to God, and will not hesitate to carry out this regrettable yet necessary task to establish peace in the newly founded republic."
POLITICS_GOIS_NRD_DESC:0 "Born in the town São Luís do Quitunde, Alagoas, in 1889, Pedro Aurélio de Góis Monteiro is a member of an influential family of military servicemen who occupied powerful positions in the old order's army. His army career began in the school of war in Porto Alegre, and he relatively quickly climbed the ranks of the military in Brazil. His position politically has always been marked by legalism, and his brother Cícero Augusto died in combat the Interstate War. But he also is defined by a strong bias against syndicalist and socialist views, which he saw as the primary threat to civilization as a whole across the world. While his position as leader of the Confederation is none one he picked himself, he is determined to establish the rule of law by any means necessary, and he enjoys widespread support for this endeavour in the recently organized national army, as the military in the region has traditionally shifted towards the right wing. The main issue while he is president however will be the many differing powerful political factions and oligarchs that have traditionally wielded power in each individual states; these coroneis will stop at nothing to increase their influence, even if this damages the overall goals of self sustainability and army reform the president defends."
POLITICS_WHITECASTLE_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco was born in Fortaleza, the capital of Ceará, in 1897, and completed his military studies in Porto Alegre, in the far south. He occupied the post of a military instructor in Rio during the Interstate War, and sided with the rebels like many other mutinous officers. Being on the winning side brought him many political advantages, and by 1936 he was an army major and one of the most influential servicemen in the nation. His most standout political belief is the strong opposition to any kind of syndicalist or socialist principles, and he always defended open war against any kind of internationalist regime as necessary to maintain peace and order. To him, syndicalists are enemies of freedom no matter what treaties they sign, and they seek to undermine the values of the nation as a way to replace them with the beliefs of Marx. This disposition might have had him in friendly terms with the AIB, were it not for his relatively strong republican beliefs. Now as the appointed president of the newly formed federation, the most pressing matters of rebuilding the administrative and transport infrastructure must at least for now take precedence over the enforcement of his planned anti-socialist and anti-union legislation."
POLITICS_COFFEE_JR_GRP_DESC:0 "Born in Natal in 1899, João Fernandes Campos Café Filho performed as a young man the typical path of Brazilian politics, working on journalism and studying law before managing a spot in local legislatures, but with the key difference of having played football professionally for Alecrim FC during the waning years of the Weltkrieg. Having positioned himself strongly in favour of the opposition in the interstate war, Café holds a strong belief in modernizing the country, but also in demoratic principles he often found were seldom respected by his peers in the old brazilian legislatures. A presbyterian protestant, Cafe Filho is a part of a minority in the intensely catholic Guararapes, but despite what foreign observers might infer, it's an extremely secondary matter, for his biggest issue when taking the rulership of the federation will be the local elites, the coroneis, whose influence and wealth made them historical political kingmakers in the region. He, however, counts as his ally the extremely influential João Pessoa, and has significant, even if broad, popular support for his democratic and liberal ideals."
POLITICS_CAVALCANTI_HOS_GRP_DESC:0 "While born in the small town of Palmeira dos Índios, Newton de Andrade Cavalcanti moved away from home quite young to pursue a military career, and he was quite successful in it. A distinguished and talented officer, he had already become a high ranking officer by the time of the interstate war, and by that point was an army major and one of the most respected servicemen nationwide. His respected position and political moderation compared to most high ranking officers made him a natural choice for leader of the federation, as the war left a wake of lawlessness, anarchy and damaged infrastructure that may take decades to repair without intense foreign aid, something that doesn't seem quite likely. His republican beliefs frequently put him at odds with some radical integralist officers; while he today denies any ties with the movement, he did have some slight sympathy for their actions against syndicalist movements, even if not for their monarchism. While he usually distanced himself from political stations, he is now the guardian of democracy in the region, as the coroneis, disgruntled integralists and the ever looming syndicalists all threaten the fragile federal order in the states of Guararapes."
POLITICS_JOAO_PESSOA_GRP_DESC:0 "João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque is perhaps the most powerful man in all of the states that forms Guararapes, his career, popularity and political clout all almost unparalleled. Having led what is considered by many to be the most successful presidential term in the history of Brazil's republic, being multiple times state president of Parahyba and led the state governors of the region as a bloc for a decade. Born in the small town of Umbuzeiro, João later moved to several different major cities, having graduated in law in the University of Recife, and lived for times in places such as Rio. He rapidly climbed the political ladder, and soon rose to the prominent position is is now widely known for. His immense credibility is why he leads the confederation; while legally could not be president of Brazil again after his term, this is an entirely different entity, and he hopes to stabilize the newly founded republic, but also secure its prosperity and repair the extensive wartime damage across the country; but he will have to face stiff opposition from coroneis and other oligarchs across the nation, even if most state presidents of the federation are his allies."
POLITICS_JOSE_AMERICO_DE_ALMEIDA_GRP_DESC:0 "José Americo de Almeida was born in the small town of Areia, Parahyba, in 1887, and became a public prosecutor in the city of Souza, in that same state, shortly after graduating from law school, and became state prosecutor at the age of twenty four. Such a rise is notable and uncommon in the usually long climb politicians have in Brazil. Americo is one of the many more established political figures to join the party, after their cooling of relations with more radical left elements after the 1936 election cycle, and lends to the administration his notable experience and gravitas as both a navigator and a talented author. While his appointment as head of state may be seen as surprising, it is in no doubt due to these new connections the party developed with important leaders, perhaps Americo's reputation as unlucky will finally turn around. Now at the helm of the entire union of Guararapes, he finds himself having to face the great challenge of managing the disparate political forces in the nation, a fact especially exacerbated by his relative lack of clout in his home state, where João Pessoa, his rival, is far more influential."
POLITICS_RACHEL_QUEIROZ_GRP_DESC:0 "Perhaps better known for her activities as an author, journalist, teacher and translator, Rachel de Queiroz mostly represents the interests of her unions than that of any established political movement in the modern post revolutionary landscape, as she never had a very deep connection with leftist cliques. Often bothered by what she considers ideological orthodoxy standing in the way of eradicating poverty, especially in her home state of Ceará, she was something of a consensus candidate among the several disparate groups that have arisen in the newly founded socialist congress, with the backing of several cearense delegates behind her. This position also may complicate her situation in executive matters, but she believes that working with a focus on the education of the lower orders will bring about greater prosperity than simple industrialization programs, or building huge railways across the nation."
POLITICS_CRIS_CORDEIRO_GRP_DESC:0 "Hailing from the small town of Limoeiro, Cristiano Cordeiro started his career in public services early, working at the state treasury while still a law student at the University of Recife. A veteran of the syndicalist movement in Brazil, Cristiano was one of the founding members of the PSB, and worked in organizing strikes both big and small in Recife for decades, while also acting in defense of the workers as a city councillor and other minor legislative positions. While he himself always positioned himself against a revolution enforced by military means, he nevertheless is the greatest syndicalist leadership in the states that form the federation, and thus was selected by it's unions as it's first chairman, while also receiving support from foreign syndicalists. His key policies are centred against combating hunger and extreme poverty that have devastated the states of the north ever since colonial times, but he also holds stances in favour of defending the rights and lands of the native peoples, who were the primary victims of the feudalistic practices of the local powerful landowners, the coroneis."
POLITICS_DJALMA_GRP_DESC:0 "A relative newcomer to the political scene, Djalma Maranhão has been involved with the worker's movement since the early 1930s in his hometown of Natal, in Rio Grande do Norte, even attempting to run for a mayoral position under the ED umbrella, albeit that endeavour did not succeed. While also a teacher and journalist, his dedication to the political cause has been intensified since the liberation and break-up of the states, as real change finally arrived to Brazil. Having gained significant support from his fellow northeastern union representatives, Djalma now prepares to take the helm of Guararapes's new, socialist government. His main goal is to improve the living standards of the people of this historically poverty-stricken land, especially those of the peasantry, who's ever growing vulnerability to droughts and food shortages caused mass migrations throughout the last four decades. Time will tell whether these extensive reform programs will be successful or not."

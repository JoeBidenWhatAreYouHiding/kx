### Leaders ###

### National Focuses ###
LOM_rule_of_law:0 "Re-Establishing the Rule of Law"
LOM_rule_of_law_desc:0 "Now that Lombardy is independent from a larger Italian entity, we must try and calm our unruly people. In large part, they fear an uncertain future, so we must decide our new nation's destiny."
LOM_building_duchy:0 "Building a Duchy"
LOM_building_duchy_desc:0 "While Lombardia, once preeminent among the Italian lands, maintained some degree of independence until the War of the First Coalition, even then, the old Duchy had been controlled by foreign powers for centuries. To establish a functional state from the carcass of a unified Italy, we must remind the people of their illustrious Ducal past of long ago."
LOM_land_reform:0 "Land Reform"
LOM_land_reform_desc:0 "The turmoil which has plagued Italy since the Weltkrieg has left the rural estates of before that terrible war in ruin and prevented their repair. With a new state and a new nobility, the time has come to renovate and reallocate the countryside."

LOM_wounds_of_war:0 "Wounds of War"
LOM_wounds_of_war_desc:0 "After such sustained bloodshed, the many wounds gouged into Lombardia and its people are at last beginning to heal. To truly mend such extensive trauma, however, will require a concentrated societal and governmental effort, one that the duke will take the lead on."
LOM_lombard_constitution:0 "The Duchy's Constitution"
LOM_lombard_constitution_desc:0 "While our duchy may still be young, it is now in a much more stable position. The time has come to draft a new constitution and finalize the structure of our government."
LOM_universal_suffrage:0 "Universal Suffrage"
LOM_universal_suffrage_desc:0 "While Duke Marcello has done much to rebuild our nation, it is undeniable that his authoritarian tendencies cannot be ignored for much longer. The Lombard people understand the true value of proper representative governance, and thus we must strive to create a true constitutional monarchy. To this extent it is necessary to replace Marcello with his apolitical very distant relative Adriano, son of Galeazzo Visconti di Lampugnano and a great enthusiast of aviation."
LOM_strengthen_duke:0 "Strengthen the Duke"
LOM_strengthen_duke_desc:0 "Lombardia's righteous Duke is like a father to the people. Like any good father, he must at times be firm with his children and guide their development. If justice and good governance are to ever be assured, the Duke must be the ultimate authority in Lombadia."
LOM_denounce_ambrosia:0 "Denounce the Golden Ambrosian Idea"
LOM_denounce_ambrosia_desc:0 "With the restoration of Lombardia, many Lombard Republicans, undeterred by the failure of their beloved Italian Republic, embraced the legacy of old Ambrosia, a uniquely Lombard strain of Republicanism. We must once and for all repudiate republicanism while also affirming constitutional governance."
LOM_return_crown:0 "Request Return of the Lombard Crown"
LOM_return_crown_desc:0 "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, inlaid with a Nail of the True Cross, was the centrepiece of the coronation of the old Frankish kings of Italy and later rested upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors.

LOM_crown_king:0 "Crown the King of the Lombards"
LOM_crown_king_desc:0 "With the Iron Crown of Lombardy in our possession and our nation firmly established, the good Duke no longer need be sullied by a title unworthy of a man of such virtue. For his sake and our people's, let us proclaim the Kingdom of Lombardia."

LOM_lombard_republic_desc:0 "We are the remnants of the Italian Republic, but we must stop thinking of ourselves as part of Italy.

LOM_question_of_radicals:0 "A Question of Radicals"
LOM_question_of_radicals_desc:0 "The first question facing our young republic is the place of radicals within it, such as those in the Fiamme Nere. Are we a free state, or should we be more cautious in the voices we give to those who might lead our country astray?"

LOM_heart_of_the_north_desc:0 "The Po Valley has always been the industrial heart of Italy. While we are a small country, there is a possibility for us to resurrect the working spirit of our people and see us doing far greater than our size might indicate."
LOM_golden_ambrosia:0 "The Golden Ambrosia Idea"
LOM_golden_ambrosia_desc:0 "The Golden Ambrosia Republic was a brief period where Milan existed as a republic, free of the burdens of aristocracy.

LOM_work_with_nobility:0 "The Place of the Nobility"
LOM_work_with_nobility_desc:0 "The aristocracy remains a powerful force in Lombardia, and we cannot entertain the idea of driving them out. We should establish a separate house of government for our lords, and work with them to build a better future for the country."
LOM_republican_cause:0 "The Republican Cause"
LOM_republican_cause_desc:0 "The only way to maintain our republic, in the face of aristocrats and syndicalists, is to defend it."

LOM_securing_milan:0 "Fortress Milan"
LOM_securing_milan_desc:0 "Now that we are working with the nobility, they have become much more cooperative in donating their lands to the common cause - not least of which is ensuring that the city of Milan itself is well-defended."

LOM_lombard_youth:0 "Youth Lombard League"
LOM_lombard_youth_desc:0 "In the hearts of its youth is a nation's integrity reinforced or destroyed.

A national organisation for the promotion of such qualities should be established immediately."
LOM_economic_reorganization:0 "Economic Reorganisation"
LOM_economic_reorganization_desc:0 "Lombardia's economy was devastated by the Weltkrieg and ravages of the socialists, and has yet to fully recover. To remedy this, nearly every aspect of the economy must eventually be reorganised."
LOM_repair:0 "Repair Efforts"
LOM_repair_desc:0 "Much of our industry and infrastructure, despite neglect, can still be repaired. A national effort to fix our industry and infrastructure must be undertaken."
LOM_milan_factory:0 "Expand Milanese Industrial Capacity"

LOM_raw_materials:0 "Raw Material Investments"

LOM_nonrepublican_schools:0 "Education Reform"
LOM_nonrepublican_schools_desc:0 "The threat of radicalism can only be fully ended if our nation's youth have the fortitude to reject its corruption. Our schools must instill values and represent political ideologies that do not work contrary to our nation's interests."

LOM_patronage:0 "Patron of the Arts and Sports"
LOM_patronage_desc:0 "Our monarch is truly a Renaissance Man, and among his many passions are the arts and the art of sport.

While many ANI members have found new life inside the Black Flames, the party is admittedly less radical than its predecessor and does not explicitly reject the electoral system. However, many within our government claim that the FM are secretly colluding with Torino's agents to bring about unification of the Italian nationalist forces in the North and the collapse of our young republic.

Many are openly expressing a preference for Marcello Visconti di Modrone, the Duke of Milan, to take his place as the ruler of Lombardia - and he certainly has the military's support. He also does seem like a man prone to authoritarian tendencies and alliance with the radical rightist elements... so can we even trust him? Should we not pursue republicanism, so long as it is in our grasp?"
lombardy.22.a:0 "We must turn to the Duke for help"

### Leaders ###
POLITICS_DUKE_ADRIANO_DESC: "The son of Galeazzo Visconti, Adriano was born during the Weltkrieg in then Italian Libya, but he was still little more than a baby when he returned to Italy. Having joined the Air Force in 1936, amid rising tensions in the peninsula, he has shown remarkable talent as a fighter pilot, and has always seen himself as one. Thrusted into the position of duke to bring stability to Lombardy, the brash and impetuous young man has little care for diplomatic niceties, or the idea that a Duke cannot pilot a fighter plane, but is still loyal and has no intention of skipping the duties of his position, for he has seen from above the consequences of syndicalism and war personally."
POLITICS_KING_ADRIANO_DESC: "The son of Galeazzo Visconti, Adriano was born during the Weltkrieg in then Italian Libya, but he was still little more than a baby when he returned to Italy. Having joined the Air Force in 1936, amid rising tensions in the peninsula, he has shown remarkable talent as a fighter pilot, and has always seen himself as one. Thrusted into the position of duke to bring stability to Lombardy, the brash and impetuous young man has little care for diplomatic niceties, or the idea that a King cannot pilot a fighter plane, but is still loyal and has no intention of skipping the duties of his position, for he has seen from above the consequences of syndicalism and war personally. The young King has recently managed to return Lombardy to its ancient status as a kingdom, in a publcity stance to highlight the soverignty of the Lombard people. Now, he turns his attention into the matter of finding a queen, and the Milanese tabloids claim he's being quite dilligent in the search"

### National Focuses ###
LOM_rule_of_law: "Re-Establishing the Rule of Law"
LOM_rule_of_law_desc: "Now that Lombardy is independent from a larger Italian entity, we must try and calm our unruly people. In large part, they fear an uncertain future, so we must decide our new nation's destiny."
LOM_building_duchy: "Building a Duchy"
LOM_building_duchy_desc: "While Lombardia, once preeminent among the Italian lands, maintained some degree of independence until the War of the First Coalition, even then, the old Duchy had been controlled by foreign powers for centuries. To establish a functional state from the carcass of a unified Italy, we must remind the people of their illustrious Ducal past of long ago."
LOM_land_reform: "Land Reform"
LOM_land_reform_desc: "The turmoil which has plagued Italy since the Weltkrieg has left the rural estates of before that terrible war in ruin and prevented their repair. With a new state and a new nobility, the time has come to renovate and reallocate the countryside."
LOM_agricultural_subsidies: "Agricultural Subsidies"
LOM_agricultural_subsidies_desc: "Our initial land reform initiatives have been successful. Now, in order to increase yields, we should offer comprehensive agricultural subsidies."
LOM_wounds_of_war: "Wounds of War"
LOM_wounds_of_war_desc: "After such sustained bloodshed, the many wounds gouged into Lombardia and its people are at last beginning to heal. To truly mend such extensive trauma, however, will require a concentrated societal and governmental effort, one that the duke will take the lead on."
LOM_lombard_constitution: "The Duchy's Constitution"

LOM_universal_suffrage: "Universal Suffrage"
LOM_universal_suffrage_desc: "While the Duke is undoubtedly virtuous and just, he and the Lombard people alike understand the value of representative government in curtailing the injustices inevitably wrought by any bureaucracy. The right to vote must be guaranteed to all of Lombardia's people."
LOM_strengthen_duke: "Strengthen the Duke"
LOM_strengthen_duke_desc: "Lombardia's righteous Duke is like a father to the people. Like any good father, he must at times be firm with his children and guide their development. If justice and good governance are to ever be assured, the Duke must be the ultimate authority in Lombadia."
LOM_denounce_ambrosia: "Denounce the Golden Ambrosian Idea"
LOM_denounce_ambrosia_desc: "With the restoration of Lombardia, many Lombard Republicans, undeterred by the failure of their beloved Italian Republic, embraced the legacy of old Ambrosia, a uniquely Lombard strain of Republicanism. We must once and for all repudiate republicanism while also affirming constitutional governance."
LOM_return_crown: "Request Return of the Lombard Crown"
LOM_return_crown_desc: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, inlaid with a Nail of the True Cross, was the centrepiece of the coronation of the old Frankish kings of Italy and later rested upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors. It was taken by Austria following its victory in the Weltkrieg; with Lombardia no longer in total disrepair, the time has come to request the return of this important symbol of legitimacy and Lombardia itself."
LOM_crown_king: "Crown the King of the Lombards"
LOM_crown_king_desc: "With the Iron Crown of Lombardy in our possession and our nation firmly established, the good Duke no longer need be sullied by a title unworthy of a man of such virtue. For his sake and our people's, let us proclaim the Kingdom of Lombardia."

LOM_lombard_republic_desc: "We are the remnants of the Italian Republic, but we must stop thinking of ourselves as part of Italy.

LOM_question_of_radicals: "A Question of Radicals"
LOM_question_of_radicals_desc: "The first question facing our young republic is the place of radicals within it, such as those in the Lego Longobarda. Are we a free state, or should we be more cautious in the voices we give to those who might lead our country astray?"
LOM_republic_constitution: "The Republican Constitution"
LOM_republic_constitution_desc: "Finally we have written a constitution appropriate for our country, one that enshrines the idea of the republic in Lombardia's consciousness."
LOM_state_industry: "The Industrial Act"

LOM_heart_of_the_north: "Heart of the North"
LOM_heart_of_the_north_desc: "The Po Valley has always been the industrial heart of Italy. While we are a small country, there is a possibility for us to resurrect the working spirit of our people and see us doing far greater than our size might indicate."
LOM_golden_ambrosia: "The Golden Ambrosia Idea"
LOM_golden_ambrosia_desc: "The Golden Ambrosia Republic was a brief period where Milan existed as a republic, free of the burdens of aristocracy.

LOM_work_with_nobility: "The Place of the Nobility"
LOM_work_with_nobility_desc: "The aristocracy remains a powerful force in Lombardia, and we cannot entertain the idea of driving them out. We should establish a separate house of government for our lords, and work with them to build a better future for the country."

LOM_securing_milan: "Fortress Milan"

LOM_republic_triumphant_desc: "Lombardia has done the unthinkable, and emerged as a nation and republic in its own right, equal to any in Europe!"

LOM_encourage_nationalism: "Encourage Lombard Nationalism"

LOM_lombard_youth: "Youth Lombard League"
LOM_lombard_youth_desc: "In the hearts of its youth is a nation's integrity reinforced or destroyed.

LOM_economic_reorganization: "Economic Reorganisation"

LOM_milan_factory: "Expand Milanese Industrial Capacity"

LOM_Brescia_factory_desc: "Brescia, while an important centre of culture, has long lagged behind the much of northern Italy in industrial development. Industrial expansion in Brescia can only be beneficial to the city and all Lombardia."

LOM_raw_materials: "Raw Material Investments"

LOM_patronage: "Patron of the Arts and Sports"
LOM_patronage_desc: "Our monarch is truly a Renaissance Man, and among his many passions are the arts and the art of sport. Inspired by his example, many of Lombardia's wealthiest citizens have also donated significantly to the arts and sporting organisations. We should give further state support to these areas and ensure the contentment of our people."
LOM_industrious_people: "An Industrious People"
LOM_industrious_people_desc: "Throughout history, Lombardia has been an economic powerhouse. We must encourage the natural productivity of our people."
LOM_longobards: "Longobardian Revivalism"
LOM_longobards_desc: "The Longobards, for whom Lombardia is named, were a Germanic people who conquered much of Italy in the sixth century.

LOM_new_army: "Re-Establishing the Army of the Lombards"

LOM_equipment_purchase: "Equipment Purchases"
LOM_equipment_purchase_desc: "It pains us to look for our arms from elsewhere, but Lombardia currently does not have the capacity to manufacture a great deal of its own weaponry. We must obtain advanced arms from abroad."
LOM_heavy_armaments: "Heavy Armaments Industry"
LOM_heavy_armaments_desc: "Heavy mechanical equipment is the backbone of the modern army, and we are severely lacking in it. We should capitalise on our industrial capacity to promote the growth a domestic industry for artillery and other heavy armaments."

LOM_drill: "Drill the Troops into Shape!"
LOM_drill_desc: "Our troops lack experience, and while training is no replacement for actual combat, to make up for the small size of our armed forces, our green units must be as prepared for war as is possible. To accomplish this, we must hire new drill instructors."
LOM_armored: "Armoured Forces"
LOM_armored_desc: "Cavalry, the age-old lynchpin of tactical success, is increasingly being supplanted by armoured vehicles. If we are to succeed on the battlefields of today, we must have tanks."
LOM_artillery_purchase: "Artillery Purchases"
LOM_artillery_purchase_desc: "While our investment in the heavy armaments industry has alleviated some of our shortages of heavy equipment, demand for artillery pieces still remains largely unaffected. We should again approach our foreign benefactor for military equipment, this time, artillery."

LOM_air_academy_desc: "The Visconti family has donated a sizable amount of its money to the construction of a new academy for the training of Air Force officers and the development of air doctrine. With funding already taken care of, we should build the academy as soon as possible."

### Events ###
lombardy.1.t: "Request the Crown of Lombardy"
lombardy.1.d.aus: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. While we are unable to force Austria to return it, they may be amicable should we request the crown's return."
lombardy.1.d.sic: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. Following Austria's recent collapse, an agent of the Bourbon kingdom in the south sprited it away to Naples. While we are unable to force the Bourbons to return it, they may be amicable should we request the crown's return."
lombardy.1.d.vienna: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. With Austria under occupation, perhaps the occupiers will return in to us."
lombardy.1.a: "Surely the Austrians will heed us."
lombardy.1.b: "Surely the Bourbons will heed us."
lombardy.1.c: "Surely they will heed us."
lombardy.2.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] requests the Crown of Lombardy"
lombardy.2.d: "The Iron Crown of Lombardy, which sat upon the heads of Holy Roman Emperors for centuries, was taken by Austria in the Weltkrieg. The Duke of Lombardia has personally requested the return of the crown in order so that he may be crowned King."

lombardy.5.t: "The Coronation of Adriano I, King of Lombardy"
lombardy.5.d: "Our most righteous monarch has been crowned King. Upon his enthronement, church bells throughout the country rang and a day of celebration was declared."
lombardy.5.a: "Lunga Vita al Re!"
lombardy.6.t: "Hiring new Drill Instructors"
lombardy.6.d: "Our rapidly growing army needs new drill officers to properly train recruits. We can either hire instructors trained on the Prussian model, or those who adhere to an Italian model."
lombardy.6.a: "Prussian drill is superior."
lombardy.6.b: "Local instructors will motivate our troops."
lombardy.7.t: "Lombardia is hiring retired Prussian Generals"
lombardy.7.d: "Lombardia has been hiring a large number of retired Generals from the Weltkrieg to provide their undisciplined troops with proper Prussian drills. While this has greatly improved their combat readiness, it has also instilled a germanophile spirit in their general staff that is beginning to affect their foreign policy."
lombardy.7.a: "This could be to our advantage."
lombardy.8.t: "Lombardy wishes to purchase small arms"
lombardy.8.d: "Our puppet, Lombardia, wishes to purchase small arms from us at a discounted rate."
lombardy.8.a: "Accept their request."

lombardy.15.c: "...the Partito Popolare Lombardo"
lombardy.15.e: "...the Lega Longobarda"
lombardy.15.f: "...the Lega Democratica Riformista"
lombardy.20.t: "The Question of Radicals"
lombardy.20.d: "One question our republic must immediately face is what we will do about the radicals which are already forming in the young Longobard League - or Lega Longobarda. A party dedicated, on the surface, to Lombard nationalism, they are drawing their members from the likes of the former ANI and even, it is suspected, a number of syndicalist sympathizers who would be more than happy to see the republic fall apart. Perhaps this isn't true, and we should allow the League their say. There are many, however, who say we must stand up against the sort of dissenters who destroyed the Italian Republic, before it's too late."
lombardy.20.a: "There is no place for radicals in this republic"
lombardy.20.b: "We stand for freedom above all else"
lombardy.21.t: "Lombardia's Future"
lombardy.21.d: "The government of Lombardia is currently in the hands of the military, which supports Duke Adriano Visconti... but the duke has expressed reservations about taking full control of the country. Despite the protests of some who say republicanism failed Italy, the duke maintains that the time for monarchies in Italy has also passed. Still, there are many in the country who support him and suggest his guidance is what the people want."
lombardy.21.a: "Republicanism cannot be trusted"
lombardy.21.b: "The Duke must step down"
lombardy.22.t: "Lombardia's Future"
lombardy.22.d: "Lombardia is in a state of turmoil, and the people currently have a great distrust of republicanism. Many are openly expressing a preference for Adriano Visconti, the Count of Milan, to take his place as the ruler of Lombardia - and he certainly has the military's support. He also does not seem like a man who much wants to rule, so it seems likely he would turn the country over to elections anyhow... but can we trust that? Should we not pursue republicanism, so long as it is in our grasp?"
lombardy.22.a: "We must turn to the Count for help"
lombardy.22.b: "No, we cannot turn back to the monarchy"

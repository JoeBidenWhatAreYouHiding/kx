flavornews.2.d:0 "As Austria's first round as an Olympic host city, the Danubian capital of Vienna has been selected for the Olympic stadiums. Austro-Hungarian laborers have built a new cultural complex, symbolically promoting unity via architecture. \nThe 1936 Summer Olympics has also marked the first time Austria-Hungary has flown under one banner, a bright and tall flag showcasing heraldry all around the Habsburg lands. Unpopular in nationalist circles of Austria-Hungary but praised by the Germans in Austria. The largest Olympics yet, the Viennese Olympics has only expanded on the 1932 Dar-es-Salaam Olympics' worldwide roster. New sports include basketball, canoeing, and handball. In a glorious propaganda victory for Vienna, the Danubian team edged out one gold medal over Germany, solidifying Danubia's victory."

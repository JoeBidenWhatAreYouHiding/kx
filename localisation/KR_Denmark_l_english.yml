### Leaders ###
CHRISTIAN_X_DESC:0 "Christian von Glücksburg rose to the Danish throne in 1912 after his father, king Frederick VIII, passed away in Hamburg. The king has thus far guided Denmark through the Weltkrieg, in which the nation remained neutral, and into the interwar, presiding over the political shift that was the rise of the social democrats of Thorvald Stauning in 1924. It is said that the king is sceptical about the prime minister and his party, but that he accepts their position in government in the knowledge that he can use his reserve power should excesses occur.\n\nMany have considered that the fact that this has still not happened after 12 years means that the king has eventually accepted the democratic parliamentarism that has been in place since the ascension of the Deuntzer cabinet in 1901."

### Focuses ###
DEN_black_monday:0 "Black Monday Arrives"
DEN_black_monday_desc:0 "The stock market crash of the Berlin Stock Exchange has crippled most sectors of the Danish economy. However a large part of our economy is based on agriculture meaning we could possibly contain the crisis with quick government intervention and the arrival of harvesting season."
DEN_kanslergaden:0 "Kanslergaden Agreement"
DEN_kanslergaden_desc:0 "Unfortunately the Danish upper house, the 'Landsting' is controlled by the opposition, rendering the government's efforts without opposition support hamstrung. If we are to mount an effective response to the hardships Black Monday brings with it, we shall have to work with them: let us invite the opposition leaders to Stauning's apartment at Kanslergaden."
DEN_agreement_with_germany:0 "Agreement with Germany"
DEN_agreement_with_germany_desc:0 "With Britain incinerating in the fires of revolution, Germany, and in a wider form Mitteleuropa have developed into our main trading partners. Part of the issue is that our goods are too expensive in these markets. This could possibly be resolved by erasing the few trade limitations still in place and receiving permission to support our own farmers over Germans in return for other concessions."
DEN_schachtian_tactics:0 "Schachtian Economics"
DEN_schachtian_tactics_desc:0 "The German economist Hjalmar Schacht has developed a theory to combat economic upheaval by having the government spend money during such crises, bringing more money in the market which in turn softens its impact. We should adopt these doctrines, as it is clear that the crisis is too rough for us to just rely on the free market."
DEN_public_works:0 "Public Works"
DEN_public_works_desc:0 "By spending our money on public works we can employ people that would otherwise be unemployed, meaning they have some money to spend which in turn will bring back life to the market. As a cherry on top we will also be able to improve our infrastructure at a relatively low cost."
DEN_devalue_the_krona:0 "Devalue the Krone"
DEN_devalue_the_krona_desc:0 "Part of the problem is that Danish agricultural products are simply too expensive for the crisis-ridden Germans. By artificially lowering the value of the Krone in relation to the Mark it will be cheaper for the German market to buy Danish produce compared to other agricultural options."
DEN_sign_of_hope:0 "A Sign of Relief"
DEN_sign_of_hope_desc:0 "Our actions to limit the impact of Black Monday are starting to pay off. It appears that more and more people are receiving money to spend again and the impact of the crisis is wearing off. While Denmark is not out of all problems yet, it seems our sound economic policy has at least eased its effects."
DEN_desanction_lockouts:0 "Ban Lockouts and Strikes"
DEN_desanction_lockouts_desc:0 "Constant employer-employee conflicts are harsh on our economy: because of the lack of profit due to black monday, employers try to lower the wages, and when employees don't accept this, they simply close the factory until they submit. Conversely, when the employees protest against their conditions, they strike. Both should be banned for a temporary period, until we can afford it."
DEN_steinckes_reforms:0 "Steincke's Reforms"
DEN_steinckes_reforms_desc:0 "Our minister Karl Kristian Steincke has had several extensive reforms to the Danish welfare state planned, but was so far unable to implement them due to the oppositions unwillingness to support it. Now, with access to a majority in the Landsting and as part of the agreement, this may be implemented, and it will likely change the world's perception of Denmark forever."
DEN_invalidity_subs:0 "Invalidity Subsidies"
DEN_invalidity_subs_desc:0 "Those who are unable to work due to a medical condition should be supported by the government. It does not fit a civilised state to let their sick and crippled die of starvation if they don't have a family when such a calamity can be avoided."
DEN_extended_unempl_subs:0 "Unemployment Benefits"
DEN_extended_unempl_subs_desc:0 "Many in Denmark have found themselves to be unemployed due to Black Monday. Earlier it would have been private insurance that would have taken this function, but the spike in unemployment has increased the premium to such a degree that few can still afford it. It is the government's duty to create a safety net."
DEN_simplify_the_sociallove:0 "Simplify the Sociallove"
DEN_simplify_the_sociallove_desc:0 "The Sociallove of Denmark are at present a patchwork of laws that differ from municipality to municipality. By organising the system on a national level it will become much clearer what rights and allowances every Dane may expect."
DEN_recovery_k:0 "Denmark has Recovered"
DEN_recovery_k_desc:0 "Through our sound economic policy Denmark has fully recovered from Black Monday. With unemployment down and earnings as well as public confidence back at pre-crisis levels, few can argue that the government did a poor job dealing with the events that were."
DEN_the_shock_landed:0 "Purchase Large Shares of Stock"
DEN_the_shock_landed_desc:0 "By purchasing large quantities of stocks in the Børsen Stock Exchange we should be able to delay or possibly stop the collapse of the stock exchange until harvesting season, which should be able to revitalise our economy as much of it is agriculture based."
DEN_madsen_mygdal_plan:0 "Madsen-Mygdal Plan"
DEN_madsen_mygdal_plan_desc:0 "Named after the leader of Venstre, Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, the Madsen-Mygdal plan calls for a reticent approach of the government, focusing on austerity and fiscal responsibility instead of the social democratic approach that is bound to just leave Denmark in debt."
DEN_strengthening_investor_confidence:0 "Strengthening Investor Confidence"
DEN_strengthening_investor_confidence_desc:0 "By supporting our companies and maintaining our balance, we shall show potential investors that Denmark is one of the safest countries to invest in, even in this turbulent time. The financial injection into the market that will hopefully follow shall help us carry ourselves out of the crisis in time."
DEN_loan_to_danish_companies:0 "Loans to Danish Companies"
DEN_loan_to_danish_companies_desc:0 "By giving loans directly from the treasury to Danish companies, we will be able to support them and allow them to bridge this time of economic uncertainty hopefully mostly unscathe, despite the fact that some of the loans will likely never be paid back."
DEN_strengthen_the_krona:0 "Strengthen the Krone"
DEN_strengthen_the_krona_desc:0 "By strengthening the backing of our currency and thus increasing its value, we will further emphasize the stable nature of the Danish economy. In addition, it will make imports cheaper making many products more affordable to the common man."
DEN_encourage_foreign_investment:0 "Encourage Foreign Investment"
DEN_encourage_foreign_investment_desc:0 "We should encourage foreigners to invest in Denmark now that we have shown that this is a safe investment. With their investments, money will enter the Danish economy which will help us recover from the crisis that hit us like a bus."
DEN_increase_tax_rate:0 "Increase Tax Rate"
DEN_increase_tax_rate_desc:0 "We can't maintain a balance without some form of action: as a growing segment of the population is unemployed the tax returns have been drastically lowered. To compensate for this we should raise the rates lest we incur a large amount of debt."
DEN_austerity_measures:0 "Austerity Measures"
DEN_austerity_measures_desc:0 "We cannot maintain the balance with taxes alone: at some point these taxes will simply have a negative effect on the economy and prolong its hardship after all: therefore it is important that we limit our expenses as well."
DEN_cut_subs:0 "Cut Subsidies"
DEN_cut_subs_desc:0 "Subsidies particularly are expenses with very limited returns: after all the money invested in these people does not find its way back to the treasury through some sort of revenue and in addition they discourage people from working. They should be drastically cut in the interest of everyone involved."
DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance:0 "Unemployment Insurance"
DEN_encourage_unempl_insurance_desc:0 "By supporting unemployment insurance we can ensure that the premiums do not rise to such extremes as had been happening in the last months, without having to resort to undue government interference or expenses giving subsidies ourselves. We should definitely support this business!"
DEN_limit_union_activity:0 "Limit Union Activity"
DEN_limit_union_activity_desc:0 "Syndicalists are a major factor in the limitation of the market economy. It should speak for itself that by limiting the activity of unions the owners of the factories will be able to cut the costs more efficiently and thus move us to recovery faster. It is in the common man's interest as well!"
DEN_healthy_dose_of_capitalism:0 "The Healthy Dose of Capitalism"
DEN_healthy_dose_of_capitalism_desc:0 "Our emphasis on the free market is slowly letting the economy recover. Recent times have been tough but the worst is over now and while we have not fully recovered yet, it appears we are already seeing the results of our sound economic policy."
DEN_recovery_mm:0 "Denmark has Recovered"
DEN_recovery_mm_desc:0 "Through our sound economic policy Denmark has fully recovered from Black Monday. With unemployment down and earnings as well as public confidence back at pre-crisis levels, few can argue that the government did a poor job dealing with the events that were."
DEN_invest_in_maersk:0 "Invest in Maersk"
DEN_invest_in_maersk_desc:0 "The Maersk company was founded in 1904 and has a strong presence over all Danish shipping. By investing into the company we should be able to stimulate more trade by expanding the merchant fleet and infrastructure in the country."
DEN_support_nordisk_film:0 "Support Nordisk Film"
DEN_support_nordisk_film_desc:0 "Nordisk film is one of the oldest cinema companies in the world. By investing into the company they should be able to create more and better movies.

DEN_reinvigorate_danish_cinema:0 "Reinvigorate Danish Cinema"
DEN_reinvigorate_danish_cinema_desc:0 "Our support of the cinema seems to have worked stellarly. Its time that we expanded our operations dedicating time and money for advertisement of the great Danish cinema. We can also use this as a chance to headline a new movie about the ever watchful Danish military protecting its people from harm."
DEN_enlarge_industry:0 "Enlarge our Industry"
DEN_enlarge_industry_desc:0 "Its no secret that Danish industry is small compared to other countries in part because of our size. While Zealand itself is very industrialized Jutland still has plenty of room to exploit so by sponsoring constructions of new factories we should hopefully be able to increase industrial output in the region."
DEN_Jutland_Highway:0 "Jutland Highway Project"
DEN_Jutland_Highway_desc:0 "With the rise of industry in Jutland it has found itself in need of more infrastructure to support it and the growing needs of the region. So we shall dedicate time and money to expanding the already good infrastructure of the area to hopefully support our other efforts in the area."
DEN_expand_kastrup:0 "Expand Kastrup"
DEN_expand_kastrup_desc:0 "The Kastrup airport is still relatively new however it is pridefully considered the first civil airport in the world and as of recently has seen huge activity.

DEN_improve_sjaelland_infra:0 "Improve Sjælland's Infrastructure"
DEN_improve_sjaelland_infra_desc:0 "With new projects and expansions being sponsored around the country attention finally shifted to Zealand.

DEN_support_the_tiftp:0 "Support the Institute for Theoretical Physics"
DEN_support_the_tiftp_desc:0 "Founded in 1921 the Institute for Theoretical Physics of Copenhagen University is a beacon of science across europe spearheading research into Atomic and Quantum physics. Lead by the famous Niels Bohr most scientists in europe have visited the institute to learn from Bohr and his studies. If we supported the institute hopefully they could expand their operations and conduct more higher quality tests. "
DEN_fund_the_copenhagen_university:0 "Fund the Copenhagen University"
DEN_fund_the_copenhagen_university_desc:0 "Much like the Institue of Theoretical Phsyics the University of Copenhagen is a center of knowledge and learning. By funding and supporting the university at large they should be able to expand and take in more students hopefully allowing more highly skilled scientists and engineers to come from their university and into Denmark. "
DEN_expand_belt_ferry:0 "Expand the Belt Ferry"
DEN_expand_belt_ferry_desc:0 "The Great Belt ferries connect the many islands of Zealand together and allow automobile and trains to travel across the islands. However there have been many complaints about the ferries mostly due to not being able to handle the amount of traffic coming through. So by expanding the ferries across Zealand and into Jutland we should be able to help alleviate the demand that has formed and provide better access through our country."
DEN_bridge_designs:0 "Designs for a Bridge"
DEN_bridge_designs_desc:0 "With the growing issues of Ferries some people have been asking for bridges to connect Denmark together. However we do not have the means to construct such a bridge, but it could be a better solution in the end hopefully by sponsoring research into construction we should be able to design a workable blueprint and methods for such bridges."
DEN_engineering_developments:0 "Development in Engineering"
DEN_engineering_developments_desc:0 "The troubles in designing our bridges has highlited a weakness of ours. We simply lack the talented engineers to properly enact our policies. So by encouraging engineers in the country with better pay hopefully we can attract more people to become engineers while also attracting foreign engineers from across Europe."

DEN_bring_haere_to_20th_cent_desc:0 "Our army is woefully out of date, without many standards of modern war like machine guns, and couldn't put up a fight if Denmark was invaded.

DEN_focus_on_defensive:0 "Focus on the Defensive"
DEN_focus_on_defensive_desc:0 "Denmark has always been proud of its neutrality and our small size would prevent any major military attacks against our enemies.

DEN_fortify_jutland:0 "Fortify Jutland"

DEN_fortress_sjaelland_desc:0 "Now that Jutland has been fortified we can turn our focus to our capital.

DEN_artillery_investments:0 "Artillery Investments"
DEN_artillery_investments_desc:0 "The key to any good modern defence is artillery, whether being used to take out enemy guns or to repulse an attack they're essential to our army.

DEN_legged_infantry_desc:0 "While some have been considering the idea of using motorisation for logistics and for possibly a form of mechanised infantry we believe that due to the size of our country we can focus on improving our standard infantry instead with better supplies and tactics to make up for a less mobile force. "
DEN_unconventional_warfare:0 "Unconventional Warfare"
DEN_unconventional_warfare_desc:0 "Denmark will never raise an army that is capable of challenging hegemonic powers like France and Germany even to the extend of merely dissuading them from invading Denmark; our population is simply too small.

DEN_reestablish_faldskaermregimentet_desc:0 "A new form of warfare is that of parachutists. By dropping these specially trained forces behind the enemy lines we can wreak havoc and potentially turn a losing front into a winning one."
DEN_surprise_element:0 "The Element of Surprise"
DEN_surprise_element_desc:0 "Noone expects it, when Danish forces suddenly appear behind them. By leveraging this element of surprise we can and will be victorious in front line situations that would otherwise be doomed due to our limited military size."

den.1.t:0 "Denmark in 1936"
den.1.d:0 "Denmark remained neutral in the war to end all wars, but at a great cost: it had to yield to its German neighbour when they demanded it minus its territorial waters. And nor did German influence on Danish society and the Danish government wane once the war was over, with Denmark finding itself to have been incorporated into the Mitteleuropa economic system at its foundation.\n\nWhile Denmark profited from the German boom in the 1920s, the Radical Left party had to yield to the social democrats of the charismatic Thorvald Stauning, who, barring a hiatus between December 1926 and April 1929, ruled as prime minister consecutively since 1924. Stauning's dream of a Danish welfare state could not be materialized yet however, since all that time the Danish upper house, the Landsting, has been under the control of the conservatives, who continued to block any such motions. Many wonder what the future will hold for Denmark: will it find itself practically reduced to a German puppetstate? Or will this tiny German country secure a future of itself as new forces rise to challenge the international establishment?"
den.1.a:0 "Denmark stands strong for the moment."

den.2.t:0 "Black Monday Hits Denmark"
den.2.d:0 "The Stock Crisis on the Berlin Stock Exchange has rapidly rippled throughout Europe, and has naturally hit Denmark as well. Investors are panicking at Børsen and the crisis is hurting other sectors as well. Fortunately, a large part of the Danish economy is based on agriculture, which means we could possibly contain the crisis by simply having the government buy up stocks; and surely the shockwaves of this crash will have withered out when it's harvesting time for our farmers?!"
den.2.a:0 "And even if not, everyone needs to eat!"

den.3.t:0 "Workers Strike"
den.3.d:0 "In response to the hardships the Danish economy has been hit by, lots of people got laid off. Worrying for their own jobs, workers in one of Denmark's major companies have started a strike, seeking an arrangement with the bosses to ensure job security."
den.3.a:0 "Let them strike!"
den.3.b:0 "Compromise!"
den.3.c:0 "Drive them back to the workplaces!"

den.4.t:0 "Unrest from the Føderation"
den.4.d:0 "Large marches have been held today by the so-called 'Kommunistisk Føderation', led by the prominent syndicalist Christian Christensen. This collection of radical trade unions stands for Syndicalism, with many of its leaders affiliated with the infamous 'storm at Børsen' assault on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange, who are directly being supported by Paris. Following the fallout of Black monday, they happily point out how in the Commune, there is no crisis, arguing for a syndicalist system in Denmark.\n\nAlthough there have been a few instances of violence where the police could intervene, especially there where the small Totalist wing of this organisation, led by former social democrat Baroness Olga von Eggers, was involved, most marches remained peaceful, possibly in the hope of provoking police action where it wasn't needed. Within the boundaries of the constitution, there is little we can do."
den.4.a:0 "Syndicalism? In Denmark?"

den.5.t:0 "The Clash Between DS and the DFP"
den.5.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of Danmarks Folkerepublikanske Parti (People's Republican Party of Denmark) by Max Arildskov after his personal friend Boris Savinkov's NRPR in 1935, the far-right of the Danish political spectrum has been hopelessly divided. Prior to the establishment of the DFP, the Dansk Samling (Danish Assembly) ruled here, but as much as their policies may seem similar, they could hardly be more divided; where the DS supports the monarchy and calls for supporting Germany at least until Syndicalism has been purged from the continent, the DFP accepts no compromise over the German occupation of Slesvig-Holsten and openly antagonizes Germany over it. In addition, they are republican in nature contrary to the DS. It is clear that only Arildskov, the so-called 'Danish Codreanu', could've torn open this fringe part of the Danish political scene, but considering the size of the pond they're fishing from, these events are more likely to harm the Danish far-right than to do it any good."
den.5.a:0 "The DS remains in the lead here"
den.5.b:0 "The DFP is rising..."

den.6.t:0 "Arildskov Visits the Vozhd"
den.6.d:0 "Max Arildskov, former volunteer fighter in the Russian Civil War and so-called 'Fører' of the Savinkovite People's Republican Party of Denmark has visited his colleague Boris Savinkov in Moscow. In his meeting he congratulated the 'Vozhd' with his newfound greater power in the Russian Republic and used the opportunity the harden his stance on the German and syndicalist influence in Denmark.\nWhile it may not amount to much, some people do seem suspectible to his words and his Russian ally's success and we do see a small growth in his movement, even if it is still barely enough to win a seat or two in the Folketing in the coming elections. The Dansk Samling is probably worried however, being the main pool of support for the party of the 'Fører'."
den.6.a:0 "'Fører'? It sounds so dumb..."

den.7.t:0 "Troubling Reports at the Farms"
den.7.d:0 "Danish Agriculture is the backbone of the Danish economy, and while this may have limited the effects of the stock collapse, troubling reports are surfacing. Contrary to our expectations, the free economies of Europe have not recovered from the shock of Black Monday, and consequently, food prices are much lower than usual. As a result, a lot of food remains either unsold or is sold at a loss, meaning that many farmers risk an inability to pay for their mortgages and therefore are liable to foreclosure of their farms. And even beyond that, the fact that they have fewer funds means that they can't buy as much from other sectors of the Danish economy as before..."
den.7.a:0 "This might be bad..."

den.9.t:0 "Farm Foreclosures"
den.9.d:0 "As expected, many farmers can no longer keep up with their loans, forcing the bank to sell their farms in impromptu auctions that are usually being bought up by large landowners who have the reserves to buy these plots of land, making the whole deal even more painful to the farmers. Many voices are raising in the government to relieve the farmers, but can we afford to do it?"
den.9.a:0 "Relieve them as soon as possible!"
den.9.b:0 "Such is the free market!"

den.11.t:0 "General Farmer's Strike"
den.11.d:0 "Across the country, farmers have entered into a farmer's strike. Recognizing that the low prices are forcing them to sell their farms, they hold off on selling their produce to force the prices to rise again. While this iniative is commendable, it hurts non-farmers immensely, who often have been hit by the crisis by now as well, who can't afford to buy their bread anymore."
den.11.a:0 "Give concessions to stop the strike!"
den.11.b:0 "We'll just have to tire them out!"
den.11.c:0 "Break this 'Farmer's strike'"

den.12.t:0 "Farmer's Strike Stands Fast"
den.12.d:0 "Despite our unwillingness to give them further relief, the farmers are resilient. They don't budge and still hope to force the food prices up so they can maintain their farms."
den.12.a:0 "It is time for us to give in!"
den.12.b:0 "It's almost done, I assure you!"
den.12.c:0 "We should've broken this long ago!"

den.13.t:0 "Farmer's Strike Subsides"
den.13.d:0 "As a result of the farmer's strike, the foodprices have risen somewhat, but not nearly as much as the farmers would've liked. They probably also hoped that the government would give them relief, but neither did this come. As more and more farms are expropriated by the banks, more and more farmers give in and sell their goods with the new marketprice that has stabilized. And since this has caused it to shrink again, this process is only being accelerated."
den.13.a:0 "That's good, I guess..."

den.14.t:0 "1936 Landsting Elections"
den.14.d:0 "The 1936 landsting elections for the Danish upperhouse have come. Since 1870, no Danish government has held a majority in both chambers of the rigsdag, so it would be a major upset if the coalition would now be able to seize the moment. And surprising, considering the economic state Denmark is in at the moment."
den.14.a:0 "Stauning does it again!"
den.14.b:0 "The Opposition maintains control"

den.15.t:0 "Kanslergade Agreement"
den.15.d:0 "This morning, representatives from the Venstre Party arrived at Thorvald Stauning's apartment at Kanslergade 10, meeting with Stauning and representatives of the ruling coalition. It is clear the results of black monday will require a greater effort than just buying up stocks to stabilize the Børsen exchange, now that Denmark's agriculture has been hit, but the government does not have the mandate in the Landsting, meaning no measures would ever come through without an agreement with the liberals. The whole day was spent viciously arguing over the details, but in the evening, possibly after some drinks..."
den.15.a:0 "...the Venstre representatives signed."
den.15.b:0 "...it was concluded no agreement could be reached."

den.16.t:0 "The Government Falls"
den.16.d:0 "It would be an understatement to say that prime minister Stauning was demoralised by his inability to gain an agreement; he has been contemplating leaving politics behind forever. However today, the choice was made for him, as the socialliberals left the coalition, arguing action would need to be taken to relieve the Danish people from black monday, and if that needs to be the Austerity Program of the conservative opposition, then that's preferable to taking no action at all. Det Radikale Venstre formed an alliance with the DKF and Venstre the same week, kickstarting the second Madsen-Mygdal cabinet, with the Socialdemokraterne reduced to the opposition."
den.16.a:0 "So be it."

den.17.t:0 "Establishment of the Rigspolitiet"
den.17.d:0 "Today the Rigspolitiet (Realm Police) started operations. This new organisation will serve henceforth as the uppermost level of Danish police, being under the command of a single national 'rigspolitichefen' - chief of police. This reform will be sure to streamline the Danish police apparatus for years to come, aiding the efficiency of our law enforcement and securing the law with an additional layer."
den.17.a:0 "...in addition it creates jobs."

den.18.t:0 "Birth of Princess Margrethe"
den.18.d:0 "Joyous news from the royal family today: crown prince Frederick and his wife Ingrid of Sweden announced that their first child has been born: Margrethe. The Danish constitution does not allow for women to inherit the throne however, so experts consider it unlikely she will some day be queen of Denmark. For now however, it is time to feast, for the royal family has received its newest member."
den.18.a:0 "Hurrah!"

den.19.t:0 "Opening of the Storstrøm Bridge"
den.19.d:0 "After 4 years of construction, the Storstrøm bridge has been opened by [DEN.GetLeader]. The bridge connects the island of Falster with the island of Masnedø, which itself had been connected to Sjælland in 1935 with the Masnedsund Bridge. Now the island of Falster can be reached by train from Copenhagen. Additionally, with the Guldborgsund Bridge, Lolland can be reached by train without the need for a ferry now as well."

den.20.d:0 "The City of Aarhus has presented a standardized version of its coat of arms, describing it as 'a blue shield with a red portal, flanked by two red towers and a spire, with depiction of St. Clement and St. Paul, dressed in blue robes. Above the portal is a golden moon and a seven-spiked golden star and underneath it and above 4 silver wives a red painted wall', having been based on the original coat of arms as featured in 1250."

den.21.d:0 "The famous composer Louis Glass has died today in Copenhagen. Glass studied at the famous Brussels Conservatory, after which he was one of Denmark's leading concert pianist until his paralysis in one arm. When his disability struck, he devoted himself to composing which resulted in several pieces of music in varying genres, including six symphonies that would later be recorded."

den.23.d:0 "Entrepeneur and adventurer H.N. Andersen, reportedly died today. Andersen was the founder of the so-called 'East Asiatic Company', the largest company in Denmark today. In addition to his business ventures, he also served diplomatically, having unsuccesfully tried to iniate peace negotiations during the Weltkrieg and as Danish Consul General in Siam.

Thrige worked in the United States until he returned to Denmark after the war, on which many speculated that he foresaw the harsh years that America would come to face. In any case, Thrige's factories are one of Denmark's leading suppliers of jobs and for that in any case, we shall be thankful!"

den.30.d:0 "Thorvald Stauning, one of the most influential statesmen of Denmark ever, has died today. Stauning, longtime chairman of the socialdemocrats brought his party to power and then to a share of the popular vote that before him noone could've conceived before. Stauning is widely credited with containing Syndicalism as well as the DFP and the DS and some voices are calling for him to be given a statefuneral, an honour normally not bestowed on Danish Prime Ministers, but considering the time he has held power, he isn't 'just a prime minister'."

den.31.t:0 "Lockout"
den.31.d:0 "Employers of several companies in one of Denmark's major cities have locked out their employees in order to force their demand of lower wages, which the employees were unwilling to accept. This will hurt our industrial output severely and some want the government to meddle in it to negotiate with the owners so production can resume as soon as possible and so the workers can make their bread again once more."

den.32.d:0 "The Danish Conservative People's Party, formerly known simply as the Right, are the third party in the Folketing. Recently however, they have been the victim of in-fighting: witnessing our system of government, the party is hopelessly divided by its democratic wing, led by John Christmas Møller, who also leads the party's parliamentary faction at the moment, who stand for the healthy democracy we enjoy in Denmark today, and Victor Pürschel, who, aided by Jack Westergaard and his Conservative Youth, desires a return to the more traditional Høyre stance with a lot of power to the king, aiming for a system much like that of the Kaiserreich. It seems that the two branches will continue their bickering for a while, allowing their social democratic competition as well as their natural allies in conservatism, Venstre, to pick off support."

Meanwhile, in Denmark a rift has formed between the socialdemocrats, hoping to preserve Danish neutrality like in the first war, and the liberals and conservatives, who worry that the syndicalists can not be trusted to leave Denmark alone if they win the war. As such, they call upon the government to join the Reichspakt while we can still fight for our independence, instead of leaving our fate hanging to the German military alone."

den.37.d:0 "Unexpected news arrived from the palace: king Christian X has dismissed [getDanishPrimeMinister] and his ministers and replaced him with Victor Pürschel, the leader of the authoritarian (royalist) wing of the DKF, citing concerns over the cabinets unwillingness to join the Weltkrieg and the risk this brings to the continued prosperity of Denmark, calling it gambling that the Hær will not be necessary for the German Heer to fend off the syndicalist menace. It is highly questionable however if the king's resolve will stay this strong if significant resistance grows to these actions."
den.37.a:0 "Should we have allowed these reserve powers to persist?"

den.38.t:0 "Outrage Over the King's Actions"
den.38.d:0 "Unsurprisingly, the king's borderline authoritarian actions have cause massive resistance, with newspapers calling him out to dismiss this 'cabinet without a mandate' and to then abdicate from his throne.

The leader of the conservative youth movement, Jack Westergaard has proposed to the new cabinet that they block the opposition representatives from entering folketing tomorrow to establish constitutionally dubious emergency laws to strengthen our control, but at the same time former prime minister Thorvald Stauning tries to convince the king to back down while the monarchy or even he himself have not yet completely fallen from grace."

Especially syndicalists seem to be highly represented in these. After a few hours though, Totalist elements start to provoke violent incidents and slowly the situation is degrading in outright rioting. The commissioner of the Copenhagen police advises using the riot police to contain the protests, while prime minister Pürschel wants to quell this dissent once and for all by deploying the army."

The Riot police assembled on both sides of Amaliegade street and the Amalie garden, slowly dislodging the rioters of the Palace's courtyard and pushing the crowd towards the Marmorkirken, where the protestors began to scatter. There have been no reported deaths amongst the rioters, although plenty of arrests have been made by the police during the cleanup.\n\nHowever, with many windows of the palace shattered and some damage to the Rytterstatuen, it is clear that the King must not remain in the premises for the near future, as his life might be endangered if the rioters return in strenght another time."

den.43.d:0 "In the recent days, the General Strike has been gaining strength, managing to slowly attract support from the non-syndicalist parts of our populace that see our actions as undemocratic. Now the strike has become more than a hinderance, and is starting to become a strain on our economy, grinding the country almost to a halt. The strikers demands are clear, and they don't seem to wish to return to their workplaces anytime soon..."

den.44.t:0 "General Strike Continues"
den.44.d:0 "Several days have passed by, and the Strike is still in full strenght and with an ever more growing influence amongst our populace. Our government is starting to run out of options, as the economy as grinded to a halt. The King is growing impatient, as We have little choice but to keep waiting for the strike to wither out or to give in to their demands, and the strikers do not seem to be willing to give up anytime soon."

den.46.d:0 "With the life of the king apparently endangered by the rioters, the government has chosen to follow Pürschel's advice. However, as the army closed in and began evacuating the King, one of the soldiers trying to control the protestors lost his nerve and shot one of the protestors. The riot quickly devolved into a firefight, as the people proceeded to throw rocks at the soldiers, with some protestors even pulling out their own weapons to fire at the attackers, which were answered by more gunshots from the army until many soldiers decided to switch sides and joined the crowd. The populace finally overwhelmed the loyalist armed forces and retook the palace and it's surrounding area. The army has been forced to pull back from the area until reinforcements arrive, as they don't possess the strenght to supress the revolt at the moment."

However, success of the commune is still far from certain, as the King has managed to escape and the army is still loyal to the old government. However, the people is rallying to the new government's call, and with their improvised forces the commune has managed to capture the Rosenberg Barracks after facing some loyalist resistance, seizing the armoury and using its weaponry to prepare the once peaceful protestors for an armed resistance..."

While Stauning is a well respected political figure amongst the protestors, many within the Føderation have denounced him as a counter-revolutionary and as a class traitor, asking for him to be imprisoned..."

Then a group of enthusiast civilian pilots has volunteered to drop these leafleats all over the country's military bases. The result is almost immediate, soldiers willingly dropping their posts and joining the commune's forces and others threatening to mutiny if the army doesn't negotiate with the commune..."
den.49.a:0 "The generals have no choice but to accept."

den.50.t:0 "The Army Crushes the Commune"
den.50.d:0 "With the imprisonment of Stauning, many of the protestors with democratic leanings have denounced the Commune, accusing it of acting exactly the same as the authoritarian cabinet. This caused a power struggle, and as both factions battled out for the control of Copenhagen, the Danish army regrouped at the gates of the city. With one swift strike, the city was retaken and both factions were put down in a matter of hours. Now, with the commune being put down, the authoritarian cabinet has finally consolidated their position."

And Denmark should be easy to pacify, perhaps even before they have the chance to contact the internationale."

den.58.d:0 "King Christian's staunch support for Pürschel's illegitimate government has done the monarchy much harm, with the support for it laying, according to most polls, far beneath the 50% mark. Many however note that this is mainly Christian's personal impopularity rather than an outright desire to be republic. The king's position clearly can't be maintained and his abdication is inevitable, but should he simply abdicate according to the normal proceedings, letting his son prince Frederick inherit, or should we take some less orthodox measures to make sure this never happens again? Many support the establishment of a republic."

Haakon however let it be known that while he was flattered by the offering, he would prefer not to ascend to the throne, citing his liking for his former kingdom and fearing that accepting the Danish throne would end any chances of regaining his 'rightful throne'.

Upon their 'conquest', they declared Christiansfeld to be 'the first of many Slesvig towns to be liberated' and some villagers even cheered to this sentiment.

Contrary to many Orthodox Syndicalist systems, these are much more open, also to more 'radical voices' like many of the former Radikale Venstre partymembers. Today the vote will be held on who will become secretary of External Affairs: Ib Nørlund, of the orthodox syndicalist faction, who stands for strong relations with the Third Internationale, Hans Hedtoft of Stauning's faction, who is taking a pragmatic approach with full support here and now and review after the war is won, and Otto Mohr, who stands for a distancing of relations after the war is over.

den.80.d:0 "His Royal Majesty, King Christian, has passed away in his home, Amalienborg Palace. He will be buried among his kin - other members of the Danish royal family - in the Roskilde cathedral some thirty kilometers outside Copenhagen. In the meantime, the prime minister has announced his son, crown prince Frederick, is the new king of Denmark!"
den.80.a:0 "The King is dead, long live the King!"

den.81.t:0 "The Constitutional Referendum"
den.81.d:0 "The government has proposed an amendment on the Danish constitution: they seek to lower the electoral age from 25 to 23 years and to replace the Landsting, Denmark's senate, with a new body called the Rigsting while the 'united Rigsdag' consisting of the Rigsting and the Folketing that will form a third chamber that will handle important bills like the budget and future changes to the constitution.\nThere is relatively little opposition against this change - not in the last place because the opposition parties support it - but according to the Danish constitution it needs to be approved by 45% of the electorate (including blank votes and those not showing up to vote), an amount of voters that might be hard to reach. Failing to pass the amendment could be a massive blow to our government."
den.81.a:0 "We'll need to raise awareness!"

den.82.t:0 "The Constitutional Amendment fails!"
den.82.d:0 "Disaster! Despite our best efforts, the amount of people who came out to vote remained stuck at 1,063,764. This amounts to 48.9% of the electorate and with a ratio in favour of 91.9%, it means the percentage of the electorate supporting the amendment remained at 44.46%; just below the threshold of 45% needed to pass. Not only does it seem we'll have to do with the old constitution from 1916. Both Thorvald Stauning from the Socialdemokraterne and John Christmas Møller of the DKF have spoken out conceding their defeat and neither seems to be very happy with this outcome."
den.82.a:0 "This won't be good for our government's image!"

den.83.t:0 "The Constitutional Amendment is approved!"
den.83.d:0 "Good news! Our extensive campaign of awareness has brought fruit, and the referendum passed easily: not only did over 90% of the electorate vote in favour of the proposed amendment, the turnout was over 55%, clearly securing 45% of the electorate behind the change and allowing the constitutional amendment to move on in full force. Both Thorvald Stauning and John Christmas Møller have expressed their approval with this outcome and it seems all but assured that the 1916 referendum will be replaced now!"
den.83.a:0 "Hurrah!"

den.85.t:0 "Thomas Madsen-Mygdal Passes Away"
den.85.d:0 "Thomas Madsen-Mygdal, the active leader of the Venstre party, has passed away today in his home among his family. Having been switching between member of the government, primary leader of the opposition and even prime minister, he has surely pressed his mark onto Danish politics. Venstre has been swift to announce Knud Kristensen as the new leader of the party; it will surely be a challenging for him to match this illustrious leader of the Danish right."
den.85.a:0 "His funeral will likely be busy with liberals..."

den.86.t:0 "Denmark Offers an Economic Deal"
den.86.d:0 "Our small neighbour Denmark has been hit hard by the very Black Monday plague that sweeps our nation as well. In an attempt to soften the blows, the Danish government seeks to make the import of Danish goods more attractive. To that end, they want to lower the exchange rate of the Danish Krone to our Mark, two currencies that are pegged to eachother within the Mitteleuropa system. In return for our cooperation the Danish state offers to buy additional German goods as compensation."
den.86.a:0 "A sensible deal, go ahead!"
den.86.b:0 "We will not betray the German common man like that!"

den.87.t:0 "Germany Accepts Our Deal"
den.87.d:0 "The German government has accepted our offer to buy additional German goods from the market if they'll cooperate in our endeavour to lower the Krone in value compared to the Mark, which has been pegged to the Krone since the Weltkrieg."
den.87.a:0 "Good, this will aid the recovery!"

den.88.t:0 "Germany Rejects Our Deal"
den.88.d:0 "The German government has rejected our offer to buy additional German goods from the market in return for their acceptance of us lowering the Krone cin value compared to the Mark. This is a setback as any attempt to do so anyways is bound to provoke German countermeasures. We'll have to recover through other means."
den.88.a:0 "Unfortunate!"

den.89.t:0 "The Founding of 'Lego'"
den.89.d:0 "The woodworking shop of Billund carpenter Ole Kirk Christiansen had been going through a rough time during the last year: due to the Black Monday crisis that hit Denmark, fewer customers order furniture in the once-prospering carpentry workshop. Christiansen therefore decided to focus on smaller projects and started to produce toys for kids. While the process has not been extremely profitable, with most customers paying in kind, it has allowed the workshop to stay afloat and the toys - now being shipped under the brand 'Lego', a contraction of 'Leg godt', 'play well' - are growing in popularity throughout Denmark as well as in Schleswig-Holstein and profits are rising."
den.89.a:0 "A splendid display of Danish ingenuity!"

den.90.t:0 "Restaking Our Claims to Schleswig"
den.90.d:0 "After we lost in Slesvig-Holsten in 1864 to the Prussians, many thought that Slesvig, the ethnically Danish northernmost part of this region would never be reunified with Denmark: Prussia, and later the German Empire, was just militarily superior to Denmark owing to its size, and antagonizing such a hegemonic power was only bound to bounce back with negative consequences for Denmark. Not anymore, as we are at war with the current occupier of Slesvig, it is time to stake our claim once more. The people of Slesvig are eager to rejoin our nation!"
den.90.a:0 "Reunification is coming!"

den.91.t:0 "Seeking German Protection?"
den.91.d:0 "Disturbingly, both Norway and Sweden have shortly after each other fallen to Syndicalism, and undoubtedly they are now looking at destroying our status-quo as well together with those in Denmark sympathizing with their cause. Voices are rising day after day that we should seek to enter into an alliance with Germany, purely for our own safety. A war with Sweden and Norway is unlikely to end well..."
den.91.a:0 "Contact Berlin as soon as possible!"
den.91.b:0 "We will survive on our own!"

den.92.t:0 "August Uproar"
den.92.d:0 "Riots have started to take place as exhaustion about the prolonged state of war Denmark has found itself in keeps dragging on. This month especially the unrest has been growing: starting in Odense, the demonstrations have spilled over to other cities in Denmark, including Funen, Esbjerg, Aalborg en Aarhus. Fortunately, Copenhagen seems to be calm, but it is clear that the appetite for war is running out."
den.92.a:0 "We have almost won, I assure you!"

den.93.t:0 "Syndikalistloven"
den.93.d:0 "The 'Law no. 349 on Prohibition of Syndicalist Associations and against Syndicalist Trade Unions' will be voted on in the Folketing, calling for the complete prohibition of syndicalist activities, specifically those of the 'Kommunistisk Føderation' on the grounds that this hurts state security and that these trade unions support our enemy.\n\nDespite the circumstances at hand, the law is controversial, as some jurists have called out the law as a violation of the freedom of association as enshrined in our constitution."
den.93.a:0 "The law passes despite the controversy"
den.93.b:0 "The law fails, letting syndicalists still operate"

den.94.t:0 "The Skåneland Question"
den.94.d:0 "With our victory over the perfidious Swedish, some have called to annex the region of Skåneland - or Scania - into our nation. We had to cede Scania to the Swedes following our defeat in the Scanian War, but three centuries later, we have finally returned the favor as the Swedes have been thoroughly humbled by our superior armies. Re-integrating this region will put a strain on our small nation, but some nationalists have argued this is but a small price for uniting with our lost brethren. We have yet to make our decision but we have the final say."
den.94.a:0 "Did the Swedes think we would forget? Skåne er dansk!"
den.94.b:0 "We must not drive a wedge between our two nations."

den.95.t:0 "The Slesvig-Holsten Question"
den.95.d:0 "With the current hectic reality besetting our southern neighbors, some have called to annex the region of Slesvig-Holsten - or Schleswig-Holstein in the tongue of the perfidious Hun - into our nation. We had to cede Kiel and the surrounding isthmus to the Germans following our defeat in the ‘Krigen i 1864’ or the Second Slesvig War, but nearly a century later, we have not forgotten. With this vital shipping hub and connection the mainland secured, we would have finally returned the favor as the vile Huns are thoroughly humbled by our superior forces. Re-integrating this region will put a strain on our small nation, but some nationalists have argued this is but a small price for uniting with our lost brethren. We have yet to make our decision but we have the final say."
den.95.a:0 "Did the Germans think we would forget? Slesvig-Holsten er Dansk!"
den.95.b:0 "We must not anger the faltering hegemon, for now."

It might be tough to motivate so many people to vote meaning we'll need to put in extra effort to ensure the amendment will pass."

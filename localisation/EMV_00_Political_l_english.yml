libertarian_possibilism_subtype:0 "Possibilist Libertarianism"
libertarian_possibilism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Possibilist Libertarianism)§!\n\n Possibilist Libertarianism, also referred to as Treintismo and Possibilismo by its supporters, is a relatively young Spanish evolution of the more mainline anarcho-syndicalism followed by Spanish anarchists of the CNT-FAI. It began life when Ángel Pestaña, alongside 29 other anarchists of the CNT-FAI, published a so called Manifest of the Thirty, which harshly criticized the actions of the CNT-FAI and its radical leaders, such as Buanaventura Durruti. This manifesto would eventually lead to a splitting of the anarchist movement, and Ángel Pestaña’s wing first implemented ideas of possibilist libertarianism in action. Possibilist libertarianism aims to legitimize anarcho-syndicalist ideas in a non-revolutionary way, seeking to implement their policies through the framework of a liberal democracy, usually in a wide popular front with other socialist, syndicalist and social democratic parties. While the eventual aims of the possibilist libertarians remain largely the same as those of their more radical comrades, such as the abolishment or heavy decentralization of the Spanish state and abandoning capitalism in favour of syndicalist principles, worker’s co-operation and communal decision making, it is considerably more moderate in its actions and doesn’t see trade unions as the main nucleus of anarcho-syndicalist action. Due to Pestaña’s experiences during the Russian civil war, Possibilist libertarianism is highly anti-authoritarian, opposing both left and right-wing forms of totalitarianism vehemently. While the ideology is mostly limited to the Partido Sindicalista formed by Pestaña and his close ally Benito Pabón, it also had some sway within CNT-FAI through anarchist Horacio Martínez Prieto, and in some ways, among the ranks of Federación Sindicalista Libertaria."
anarcho_abertzalism_subtype:0 "Anarcho-Abertzalism"
anarcho_abertzalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Anarcho-Abertzalism)§!\n\nAnarcho-Abertzalism is an uniquely Basque answer to the problem that anarchists from freshly independent nations face. Theorized first by Felix Likiniano and his partner Kasilda Hernaez right after the independence of Basque Country from Spain, and later expanded upon by Frederick Krutwig, Anarcho-Abertzaleism takes the nascent left-wing nationalist movement of Basque Country, the abertzales, and merges it with the anarchist platform of decentralization, economic collectivization and stateless society. Anarcho-Abertzalism denounces the nationalist ideas of Sabino Arana, one of the main ideologues of current Basque nationalism, which tied Basque nationalism heavily to race and contrasts Basque people as more pure and pious than their Castilian counterparts . Anarcho-Abertzalism instead focuses on the Basque language and wider culture as a unifying factor, and often supporters of the ideology align with other left-wing nationalists such as the Eusko Alderli Sozialista. Heavily militant and disconnected from rest of Iberian anarchism, the movement is denounced by more mainline anarchists and anarcho-syndicalists of CNT-FAI and the Commune of France for aligning so closely with statist parties and movements, but it has gained quite a bit of traction among the less ideologically dogmatic members of the Biscayan and Gipuzkoan anarchists, who often associate more with the Basque people and tradition than the wider ideas of anarchism."


left_carlism_subtype:0 "Left Carlism"
left_carlism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Left Carlism)§!\n\n Left Carlism, also known as Social, or Socialist Carlism, is a unique tendency of Carlism that was developed as a response of continued discontent with the movement’s stagnancy and decline, and the rise of socialism as a prominent political force in the world. Emerging from the disillusioned sections of their youth sections and the few supportive scholars and politicians of the movement and, this heterodox tendency advocated for a total break from the traditionally autocratic and ultraconservative roots of the ideology behind, viewing them as mere shackles that held the movement back from true monarchism. Taking influences from socialist movements around the world, particularly of communist and communist-adjacent workers’ self management models adopted by Bukharin, Josip Broz, Karl Renner, Otto Bauer and more, those who are identified by the label advocated for a pluralist socialist democracy, led by a reformed democratic Carlist organization, which would become a mass party fusing socialism and constitutional monarchism. In addition, they retained their former commitment to regional and local autonomy, but now through a lens of socialist federalism, Left Carlists have managed to raise popularity and begrudging respect from the many disparaging ethnic groups of Spain, even with the most stubborn of separatist regions of Catalonia, Basque Country, and more. However, despite their overt radical left-wing ideals, the Christian ideals and origins of the movement remained as a guiding principle of those who follow, or claimed to follow the ideology, as well as suspicions to outright disdain of modern liberal principles in favour of Catholic personalism and Christian democracy, even if under a Red lens. While the movement remained rather tiny and has struggled to attain legitimacy, due to suspicions of the tendency by most on all sides of the political spectrum, as well as various splits between more nationalist-leaning and more socialist-leaning factions, it continues to influence the minds of many within the Spanish nation, and, if given enough push from forces both inside and outside Spain, perhaps Carlism could be given a proper rejuvenation from its traditionalist stagnancy into a reformed, democratic and populist ideology fit for the Spanish masses."
radsoc_paternal_socialism_subtype:0 "Paternal Socialism"
radsoc_paternal_socialism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Paternal Socialism)§!\n\nPaternal Socialism, also called Conservative Social Populism, Paternalistic Conservatism, or more rarely Christian Conservative Socialism in the Western World, is a unique thoughtform that attempts to fuse the seemingly contradictory ideas of traditional Conservatism and non-Marxist Socialism or Progressive Populism. Born during the Industrial Revolution in England and Germany but now increasingly common outside the Western World such as in Latin America or Africa where the rules and expectations of European-biased Socialisms do not apply, these strange systems seek to build moral, Conservative societies usually, but not always, rooted in theist ethics, Conservative welfare economics, class collaboration and cooperation, and/or ideas of Civic Nationalism and non-extremist Nationalist Patriotism. Often linked to ideas of Market Socialism, Christian Distributism, charity economics, Bismarck's State Socialism and economic interventionism, Red Toryism, and other wealth-sharing programs, Paternal Socialists seek to build egalitarian, non-predatory economic systems geared against ideas of class struggle that fuse Capitalist and Socialist ideas in a Consevative and Paternalistic package for the good of their usually traditionalist and nationalist peoples while undermining and weakening normal Socialist and Leftist movements to preserve tradition and societal stability, even if that puts them at odds with other Socialists or Conservatives around the globe."
radsoc_yellow_syndicalism_subtype:0 "Yellow Syndicalism"
radsoc_yellow_syndicalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Yellow Syndicalism)§!\n\nYellow Syndicalism is a veritable ideological curiosity, claiming to defend the values and rights of the proletariat through the unions while not attacking the bosses or their positions. Rooted in the general strike at the Schneider&Cie mines in the Creusot in 1899, the "Yellows" had the same social demands as the "Reds", the so-called revolutionary socialists, but condemned strikes as a counter-productive means of achieving this goal, even taking part in strike-breaking accompanied by the authorities. Similar Yellow unions quickly sprang up all over France before they were successfully federated by Pierre Biétry, who gave them a slogan: 'Work, Family, Homeland". Biétry also developed this form of unionism ideologically, rejecting the revolutionary approach that the workers' enemies were the bosses, he demonstrated that the real enemies of the French workers were the Boche and the Jew, cultivating a strong nationalism within his organization, receiving monetary support from many industrialists before the Revolution of 1919, with the goal of countering the much larger Red Syndicalist movement. Biétry also trained union members in paramilitary techniques, inspired by the Camelots du Roi and the Croix-de-Feu, to give them the means to achieve their final aim: establishing a democratic, nationalist and social French Syndicalist Republic, a perfection of the current Communard system."

Blasquismo is, at its roots, a populist ideology with a Spanish republican lean, with its core tenets being those of relentless grassroots activism, protection of Valencian culture and occasionally, violence against political opponents. Blasquist activism was organized primarily in various casinos located in the city of Valencia and in the newspaper articles written by Blasco Ibáñez. This led to the movement’s demonstrations being more sporadic and improvised than those of their fellow liberal republicans, but also netted them a far larger working class support than was typical to Spanish centrist parties. Like the more mainline radicals of Spain, Blasquismo is fervently anti-clerical and also historically fought with the Catalans over their attempts to expand political actions into Valencia. Blasquist movement underwent a period of civil war as Blasco Ibáñez and his party rival Rodrigo Soriano clashed over leadership, leading to bloody clashes between their supporters. This exemplifies best the difference between Blasquismo and other Spanish centrist Republicans, the grassroots nature and closeness to Valencian people has in the past cause the movement to inspire great fanaticism and party tribalism in its supporters. As can be expected, Blasquismo is heavily tied to the ideology of Alejandro Lerroux’s Radicals, as the main Blasquist party, Partido de Unión Republicana Autonomista, was a close ally of Partido Radical. However, this alliance has undergone several periods of falling out and reunification, where the entire Blasquist ideology has shifted more towards conservatism or back towards more traditional radicalism depending on their relationship with the larger party."

The populist means used by Lerrouxists are also enhanced in part by the control the party holds over worker entertainment centres, such as the street of Paralelo in Barcelona. This has in the past allowed Lerrouxists to remain close to the grassroots militants of the party, as well as organized crime involved in gambling. Lerroux’s demagoguery and ideological flexibility has allowed this ideology to thrive despite the various twists and turns the Spanish politics have taken, but it may not always lead to the best results given the scandalous reputation the party has forged for itself."

Not so much a coherent ideology as it is a natural attribute of many dictatorial or authoritarian regimes, pure Kleptocracies shun ideology, or merely parade around with an ideological facade, while pursuing any and all avenues towards the fulfillment of the ruling group’s ambitions and greed.

Split between groups that support deregulation and the free market, and those that instead support economic interventionism, these groups are united in their pursuit of civil liberties and freedoms while championing Conservative social positions.

iberian_federalism_subtype:0 "Integral Federalism"
iberian_federalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Integral Federalism)§!\n\nFederalist ideas in Spain and wider Iberia go back to the late 1700s, but the only real project for a truly federalized Spain appeared during the 1870s, during the short-lived First Spanish Republic. Given the immense variety of Spanish conditions within the boundaries of its international borders, with some areas like the Basque Country or Catalonia having a very distinct cultures and languages, the idea of federalism has been raised multiple times to create a nation that could unite these disparate groups while still supporting or tolerating their unique nature.  During the process, a concept of a Spanish federation was created, outlining that the Spanish nation would be a hybrid, between pure federalism and centralist Jacobinism. During the first and second Republics of Spain, it was recognized that Spain as a nation was made up of various smaller states, with autonomy given to their regional actors and municipalities.\n\n The Second Republic of Spain saw this idea transformed into the term Integral State, which would see autonomy granted to those regions that had an overwhelming desire for it, for example Galicia, Catalonia and Basque country. The Integral federalist approach has been utilized by various regional parties of Spain as well, with especially more conservative parties like Dereita Galeguista and Liga Catalana aiming for strong state level autonomy within an otherwise unitary state of Spain, imbuing local nationalism with a greater, more macro-level ideal of Hispanic unity, usually with some degree of Iberism mixed in, in rare cases involving Portugal in the greater Iberian Integral Federation. While the political programs of Integral Federalists may vary widely, and even the degree of federalism that different parties aim for may be completely different, the core value is the belief that Spain, as a nation, is inherently an unified concept, and that regional actors are better off under the wider umbrella of a Spanish nation than as a separatist, independent nations."

soccon_right_georgism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Right Georgism)§!\n\nRight Georgism is an evolution of the originally Left-wing ideology of Georgism as first theorized by American Socialist and economist Henry George. Noted by George in his lifetime to be the ‘Single Tax Limited’ group as opposed to his own ‘Single Tax Unlimited’ group that became the foundation of Left Georgism, Right Georgism - also called Geoism to distinguish it from the Socialist nature of its birth - seeks to repeal all unjust and inefficient taxes and replace them with a single system based around a land value tax as the single tax pushed by the movement. However, this LVT is not spread across the entirety of society like its Leftist counterparts advocate, instead only utilizing it in plots and regions where it would be beneficial to the masses and the economy, though how this is determined, who determines it (whether it be private companies, the public, or the State), and the extent of its use varies greatly based on the group and their ideological biases. Split between a more conservative strain that pushes for limited social spending financed by the concept of rent value capture that only captures a portion of the land rent while the rest is kept by the government for funding purposes, and the Geolibertarian position that demands that all excess rents should instead be gathered and distributed among the masses, Right Georgism is a varied and ever-evolving thoughtform that has begun to form the foundation of a number of budding movements across the non-Socialist spectrum."

pataut_synarchism_subtype:0 "Synarchism"
pataut_synarchism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Synarchism)§!\n\nFormulated as a reaction to the Mexican Revolution and the increasingly Leftist policies of Zapata’s regime, Sinarquismo - or Mexican Synarchism - is the brainchild of José Antonio Urquiza and Salvador Abascal, alongside other thinkers such as Urquiza’s brother Carlos and the movement’s leading ideologues - the brothers Jose and Alfonso Truebas Olivares, as outlined in the movement’s self-published ‘Sinarquista Manifesto’; though it also holds some superficial similarities with a different concept also called Synarchism penned by the French occultist Alexandre Saint-Yves as an opposite to anarchism, and also shares a name with Thomas Stackhouses’ ‘synarchy’ which means joint/harmonious rule. Sinarquismo is divided between two main factions, the revolutionary nationalists and national syndicalists of Urquiza, and the orthodox millenarians and assorted advocates of ‘Catholic Social Order’ headed by Abascal, while a small subfaction pushes in a more ‘moderate’ and semi-democratic direction by advocating either a union with the National Action Party or a transition of the National Synarchist Union into an official party of its own in order to garner wider public support, but both are moves detested by most true Synarchists due to their deep-seated hatred for democracy. Synarchists all agree that Leftism, Liberalism, and Atheism are the three worst things to haunt the modern world despite the other minor differences that divide them, and as such all factions seek to return to a more traditional and ultra-conservative platform under a supreme executive so that Mexico can be cleansed of sin, while also incorporating other varied ideas such as national conservatism, anti-populist class collaboration, Catholic theocratism, integral nationalism, Rightist communalism, and corporatist statism. Additionally, Synarchism maintains a symbiotic relationship with the Mexican Integralist movement as developed by Abascal alongside the great ‘cultural caudillo’ José Vasconcelos and Mexico’s surviving clergy and aristocracy, linking the two Far-Right political movements into one ‘Synarchointegralist’ coalition jointly aimed at saving Mexico with faith and fire while mixing ideas between the two groups - much to the chagrin of the Urquiza and his radical clique who now struggle in debate on the merits of republicanism with their new monarchist allies. Also holding tangential links to similar movements across the Catholic Right in places like Austria and Iberia through a shared adherence to the ‘Rerum novarum’ of Pope Leo XIII, Sinarquismo is the Mexican Right’s last chance to fully turn back the clock to a pious time before the Mexican Revolution."

integrism_subtype:0 "Integrism"
integrism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Integrism)§!\n\nIntegrism is a Spanish variation on the French and Portuguese integralism, representing the very right-most flank of Spanish traditionalist politics by advocating for near total domination of Catholicism in the nation. The greatest extent of Integrist relevance was during the founding of Partido Integrista, and while the party has mostly fallen into irrelevance, it continues as a minor current within Basque traditionalism and Carlist extremism. Theorized originally by prominent traditionalists such as Ramón Nocedal and Juan Olazábal, Integrism differs from the traditional dividing lines of Spanish traditionalism, which usually are separated by the dynastic lines, with Carlists and Alfonsists theorizing on their own variations on traditionalist thought.\n\n Integrists in turn do not have a selected monarch to support, and in the 1920s and 1930s the movement adopted accidentalism, an ambivalence to working within the frameworks of monarchy and republic alike, into their program, and as the movement has been sidelined by more mainstream traditionalists, aspects of mysticism and millenarianism have creeped into the movement, with some Integros even supporting crowning Jesus Christ as the symbolic king of Spain, to rule the nation as the end times approach due to the diabolic false gods of Syndicalism and Liberalism. In the view of Integrists, the ideal state is one made up of various natural organisms, be they trade unions, corporations or even family structures, and the state itself is merely there to ensure that this organism runs in practice.\n\n The Integrists approach all social issues from the point of view of religion, seeing poverty, inequality and regionalist issue as the creation of liberal failures to create true equality in a way that a truly Catholic society would be able to achieve. In practice, Integrists believe in a state run by those most capable and pious to do so, as their electoral successes have proven that Integrists most often prefer the opinions of experts to those of politicians, and their mistrust of politicians is equally evident in their vehement distaste for any form of democratic organization. While not particularly different from mainline Carlism in practice, its stubborn disregard for solving social issues in any way other than religious one, and fundamentalist approach to Catholicism causes even traditionalists of deep faith from other parties to find the movement dangerous and frightening, if obscure, political force."


liberating_nationalism_subtype:0 "Vibrantism"
liberating_nationalism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Vibrantism)§!\n\nVibrantism, or Liberating Nationalism, is the personal ideology of Catalan nationalist, Daniel Cardona i Civit, known locally by the nicknames Vibrant and the Irishman, and his party, Nosaltres Sols. Vibrantism as an ideology espouses a form of Catalanism, that is, Catalan nationalist and cultural movement, where the separation of Catalonia from Spain and Hispanishness in all its forms, be they monarchist, autocratic or republican, is the most important aim. The ideology is heavily influenced by Cardona’s own experiences within the Catalan nationalist movements, as during his collaboration with parties such as Estat Catala, he was often expelled for advocating for complete separation from Spain after more pragmatic actors accepted offers from Madrid for a more autonomist solutions.\n\n Vibrantism is also inherently liberal and democratic, despite its militant and nationalist roots, as Cardona saw ideologies such as Totalism and Legionarism as the state imposing itself on the individual, whereas he saw his own nationalist thoughtform as the individual imposing themselves on the state. According to Cardona, nationalism is inherently social, not political, and it respects and preserves the being of the individual, the family, the municipality, the region and the nation. To him, nationalism is the preservation of the spiritual and human content of every social element. Vibrantism is also quite fluid in its support, as it tends to aim for an apolitical, trans-classist approach, seeking support from working-class nationalists as well, evident in Nosaltres Sols’ alliance with Partit Catala Proletari. Cardona considers nationalism to be an evolutionary trait of peoples, and thus incapable of being truly crushed even in the face of imperialism or disruptive ideologies of the day. This, at times paradoxical ideology, is slowly becoming more mainstream in Catalan politics after the inclusion of Nosaltres Sols in parliamentary politics, and it may very well see new evolutions to its base formula now that separation from Spain has been achieved."

natpop_integrism_subtype_desc:0 "§Y(Integrism)§!\n\nIntegrism is a Spanish variation on the French and Portuguese integralism, representing the very right-most flank of Spanish traditionalist politics by advocating for near total domination of Catholicism in the nation. The greatest extent of Integrist relevance was during the founding of Partido Integrista, and while the party has mostly fallen into irrelevance, it continues as a minor current within Basque traditionalism and Carlist extremism. Theorized originally by prominent traditionalists such as Ramón Nocedal and Juan Olazábal, Integrism differs from the traditional dividing lines of Spanish traditionalism, which usually are separated by the dynastic lines, with Carlists and Alfonsists theorizing on their own variations on traditionalist thought.\n\n Integrists in turn do not have a selected monarch to support, and in the 1920s and 1930s the movement adopted accidentalism, an ambivalence to working within the frameworks of monarchy and republic alike, into their program, and as the movement has been sidelined by more mainstream traditionalists, aspects of mysticism and millenarianism have creeped into the movement, with some Integros even supporting crowning Jesus Christ as the symbolic king of Spain, to rule the nation as the end times approach due to the diabolic false gods of Syndicalism and Liberalism. In the view of Integrists, the ideal state is one made up of various natural organisms, be they trade unions, corporations or even family structures, and the state itself is merely there to ensure that this organism runs in practice.\n\n The Integrists approach all social issues from the point of view of religion, seeing poverty, inequality and regionalist issue as the creation of liberal failures to create true equality in a way that a truly Catholic society would be able to achieve. In practice, Integrists believe in a state run by those most capable and pious to do so, as their electoral successes have proven that Integrists most often prefer the opinions of experts to those of politicians, and their mistrust of politicians is equally evident in their vehement distaste for any form of democratic organization. While not particularly different from mainline Carlism in practice, its stubborn disregard for solving social issues in any way other than religious one, and fundamentalist approach to Catholicism causes even traditionalists of deep faith from other parties to find the movement dangerous and frightening, if obscure, political force."

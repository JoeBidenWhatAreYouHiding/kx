###Bio###
POLITICS_PAVLO_SKOROPADSKYI_DESC: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi, opportunist, Cossack, military officer, descendant of Ukrainian nobility, but above all - he is Hetman, leader of Ukraine, whose power depends only on Soim and the King.\n\nTracing his lineage back to the hetman of the 18th century Zaporozhian Army, Skoropadskyi rose through the ranks of the tsar’s military in a flash. During the Ukrainian Revolution, Pavlo Skoropadskyi became the chief organizer of the specially created Ukrainian Army Corps and numerous Cossack volunteer detachments that sought to fight the pro-Bolshevik militias. An ardent opponent of socialism, Skoropadskyi, along with his capitalist, landowner and military allies, began a conspiracy against the Ukrainian People’s Republic before overthrowing it on April 29, 1918. This could not have been accomplished without the Kaiser’s help, and to repay him, Skoropadskyi soon found himself in deep military and economic ties with Germany.\n\nOnly King Vasyl, who in the eyes of the hetman is seen only as a compromise imposed by the Austrians, resists. Anything deemed contrary to the national interest is strictly forbidden and brutally persecuted. With the weakness and powerlessness of Soim, there is only a faint illusion of democracy in Ukraine, but hatred for the Hetman’s autocracy grows among the court and a conspiracy matures..."
POLITICS_VASYL_DESC: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia. In fact, among the few legal parties of Ukraine sitting in the Soim, it is Vasyl who is being put faith on. However, with a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman and his SHD, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_VASYL_PRESIDENT_DESC: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine.

In fact, among the few legal parties of Ukraine sitting in the Soim, it is Vasyl who is being put faith on. However, with a stagnant economy, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and most of all, tension with the influential Hetman and his SHD, Vasyl struggles to maintain authority."
POLITICS_LEO_STEFAN_DESC: "King Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen, while ethnically Austrian, has been raised in the Ukrainian culture. While to some, Leo’s ascension is indicative of compromise between the Reichspakt and Ukraine, many lament the continued dominance of Ukraine by foreigners. The real compromise, these dissidents claim, was between Germany and Austria, who are now united in support for Leo. Domestically much of Leo’s support comes from the powerful land-owning class who now control the Soim and who see the young king as little more than a puppet to illicit Austro-German support for their endeavours."
POLITICS_LEV_II_DESC: "Count Leo Stefan was born to the Habsburg-Lorraine family on June 12, 1928. Being groomed to potentially succeed to the throne of a Eastern European state, Leo ended up gaining a lot of knowledge and respect for Ukrainian customs. Eventually he would be raised to this position as Lev III once King Vasyl was killed by a communist, he now tries his best to represent Ukraine. This knowledge and actual attempt to help Ukraine was noticed by some socialists who wished to keep the stability of the crown yet bring forth leftist ideals. Being entangled within these ideals, Lev the II now reigns Ukraine as the People’s King, representing and supporting their struggles against those that would keep the peasantry, and wider Ukraine down."
POLITICS_DANIIL_I_DESC: "Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of the famous 'Hetman', has ascended to the Ukrainian throne. With the long power-struggle between the Hetman and the monarchy finally resolved, Ukraine breathes a sign of relief. Danylo however is quite rightly seen by many as little more than a puppet king, effectively allowing his father to the bulk of rulership while he himself acts as the front-man. Perhaps after Pavlo Skoropadskyi’s death will the young king finally be able to assert himself but for now the young king will do just as he is told."
POLITICS_MIKHAIL_BULGAKOV_DESC: "Mikhail Bulgakov, an ethnic Russian born in the Kyiv governate, was for much of his life known more so for his prolific writings and literary talents rather than politics. After finding himself heading up the Russophile ViN organisation, he is now in charge of the government and has made his intentions clear that the so-called 'Free State of Ukraine' is little more than a temporary fixture until the nation can be annexed into the motherland once more."
POLITICS_DMITRI_DONTSOV_DESC: "Dmytro Dontsov has been are the forefront of Ukrainian nationalism for many years and has solidified his position as the primary nationalist ideologue in Ukraine. Having allied with Konovalets and his UVO, Dontsov has become powerful during the interwar and now finally ascended to a position of leadership with his intentions of driving out both German and Russian influences as well as a general crackdown against socialist activity."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_KONOVALETS_DESC: "Yevhen Konovalets is the recognizable leader of the Ukrainian nationalist movement and its prime military-political organization, the UVO. His biography is the history of Ukrainian Independence, its struggle for national identity and sovereignty.\n\nBorn in the village near Lemberg, Austria-Hungary, Konovalets was always connected to the Ukrainian national movement. In the pre-Weltkrieg years he became an active member of the Prosvita becoming the secretary of the Lemberg Department, the Ukrainian educational association, In 1913 he met Dmytro Dontsov and became greatly influenced by the nationalist ideology and rhetoric. \n\nConscripted to the Austro-Hungarian Army during the war, he became prisoner-of-war in Russia, where he joined a group of former Galician officers together with Andrii Melnyk, eventually fleeing to Kyiv together. Serving for the independent Ukrainian Republic, he organized the division of Sich Striltsi and later assumed its command, effectively suppressing the Bolshevik uprising in Kyiv and resisting the Communist offensive.\n\nHe soon became the Colonel of Army and the Sich Striltsi regiment of Konovalets were considered one of the most combat-ready units of the Ukrainian army.\n\nEverything changed when the Hetmanate has risen. The regiment was disarmed and disbanded at the request of German command only to Konovalets receiving permission from Hetman Skoropadskyi to form a separate detachment of Sich Striltsi as part of the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian state in Bila Tserkva a few months later. The command of the created unit was opposed to the Hetman, but remained faithful to the oath given to the Hetman.\n\nAfter the end of the war, Konovalets, together with Andrii Melnyk and Dmytro Dontsov formed the UVO - a nationalistic organisation, which proclaimed its goal to create a conciliar independent Ukrainian state on ethnic Ukrainian lands with a supreme leader, Konovalets, as its head."
POLITICS_VYACHESLAV_LYPYNSKY_DESC: "Viacheslav Lypynskyi is known to be the main ideologue of the new Ukrainian statehood, the Hetman Movement, the Ukrainian Conservatism, or as he called it himself, the 'theory of Ukrainian Hetman Nationalism'. Despite this, he is a staunch critic of the Hetmanate, as he confronts Skoropadskyi’s desire to become the absolute monarch of Ukraine, as well as he sharply criticizes the radical 'integral nationalism' of Dontsov.\n\nBeing leader of the USKhD, a party once created to support the Hetman, Lypynskyi is soon to find himself among the other oppositional parties and main enemies of the Hetmanate regime."
POLITICS_OLEKSANDR_SHAPOVAL_DESC: "Not much known about Oleksandr Shapoval. Born in Poltava Governorate in a family of peasants, Oleksandr rose, as many did, with the help of army service. In 1917 he became the commander of the 1st Cossack regiment named after Bohdan Khmelnitskyi, the first Ukrainian unit in the Russian Army, later better known as Bohdanivtsi. That is when he became acquainted with Petro Bolbochan and became involved in the activities of the UPSS. First a supporter of the Hetman, Shapoval later found himself in the opposition - together with the USKhD. Being a representative of a conservative wing of the UPSS, Shapoval is looking forward to establish a conservative regime, either with a strong presidential power, or under the command of Vasyl Vyshyvanyi."
POLITICS_OLEKSANDR_HREKIV_DESC: "Born in the noble family near Sumy, Oleksandr Hrekiv lived a life of a typical member of the Russian gentry. According to family tradition, his ancestors were Greeks and the founder was thought to be Logophetos, a courtier of Tsarevna Sophia Palaeologus, who came to Moscow in 1472 along with her court.\nGraduated from Moscow University with the Law Degree in 1897, Oleksandr decided to tie his life with the military service, serving in the grenadier and guardian regiments of the Imperial Russian Army. He also taught political and military history in St. Petersburg until the Weltkrieg.\nIn 1917 he identified himself as Ukrainian and was the head of the garrison and then Deputy Minister of War. After the Hetman came to power, Hrekiv established and headed the Ukrainian Military Society \"Batkivschyna\", closely connected with the UPSS. Batkivschyna was focused to bring together the military officers and leaders, that opposed the Hetmanist government. While he is considered a supporter of Petliura, he served as the Chief of General Staff in Skoropadskyi's Army from October 1918 to 1921, and participated in the Army Reform. It is largely Hrekiv's merit that Skoropadskyi managed to build up a professional army. However, it was dangerous for Skoropadskyi to keep Hrekiv at such a high position. He was almost arrested for false accusations in official embezzlement, but due to Austrian mediation he was sent to train officers of the Ukrainian Galician Army in Galicia-Lodomeria. It was not until 1930, when he returned to Ukraine at the invitation of King Vasyl, his acquaintance, despite Hrekiv never supported his claims and even opposed them.\nNow, as the leader of free Ukraine, Hrekiv is seeking to fulfill the requirements for Ukrainian true independence - and the first and foremost, the strong and disciplined army."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_MELNYK_DESC: "Andriy Melnyk, colonel of the Army of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, one of the closest associates of Yevhen Konovalets, as well as one of the organizers of the Ukrainian Military Organization. Since the late 1920s, by order of Konovalets, he was in Galicia, where he represented the UVO, engaged in propaganda of Ukrainian nationalism and distributed anti-Austrian and anti-Polish leaflets.\n\nA staunch nationalist, proponent of the Ukrainian Natiocracy, Melnyk is seen as less radical than Dontsov and Konovalets, focusing more on militarism and centralisation, than on fierce radical nationalism."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_DOROSHENKO_DESC: "For Hetman - Doroshenko is a loyal subject, for nationalists - a liberal, and for the Central Committee of the UPR in exile - he is a traitor. \n\nOnce a member of the UPSF, shortly after Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power, Doroshenko became one of the leaders of the Hetman movement, Minister of Foreign Affairs and the main representative of the interests of the national democratic forces. Having created the USKhD together with Lypynskyi, Doroshenko was expelled from the party by the end of the 1920s. This was due to the ideological split between Lypynskyi and the Hetman. Doroshenko re-established the UPSF, as the left wing of the party renamed itself to the ULD(S-F), and remained one of the few supporters of Skoropadskyi, although he held more democratic views. Perhaps one day, he will be able to implement them without conflicting with the interests of the Hetman."
POLITICS_DMYTRO_LEVYTSKY_DESC: "Dmytro Levytskyi was born in the Lemberg region of Austria-Hungary, in 1877. He completed law school at the University of Vienna and during Weltkrieg served as an officer in the army of Austria-Hungary. Captured by the Russians in 1915, he spent the remainder of the war in Tashkent. Returning to Ukraine as the Russian Empire fell apart, Levytskyi hoped that the Austria-Hungary will fell, finally allowing for the West Ukrainians to unite with the rest of the country. Unfortunately, it did not happen. Forced to exile, as many democratic leaders, Levytskyi soon established the UNDO together with Mikhnovskyi, becoming his only ally.\n\nNow, when the UNDO finally stays triumphant in the mainland Ukraine, Levytskyi will do all his best to create a constitutional democratic republic with strong national identity."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_MIKHHNOVSKY_DESC: "'Mykola Mikhnovskyi is a Ukrainian elemental force,... which is restrained only by a strong and noble mind. He was a highly educated and experienced lawyer, a subtle psychologist, a successful initiator, an outstanding organizer, a brilliant speaker, a talented publicist, an intelligent and tactful leader, an intuitive military commander, an excellent connoisseur of our past, our history and everyday life, a typical revolutionary, that is, a person capable of decisive action. Brought up in good Ukrainian traditions, raised in a Ukrainian village, Mykola Mikhnovskyi was a model of Ukrainian racial culture, a Ukrainian aristocrat in all meanings of this concept.' - is the most flattering description of Mykola Mikhnovskyi.\n\nIn fact, the reality is somewhat different. All his life Mikhnovskyi defended ideas that were not supported by the majority. He has gained a strong reputation as a complex person with whom it is difficult to communicate. Extreme demands narrowed the circle of his friends: only those who shared his views became close.\n\nAn opponent of the policy of the Central Rada, a supporter of Skoropadskyi’s coup, Mikhnovskyi, unfortunately, turned out to be on the other side of the barricades against his will.\n\nDespite the negative reviews, the Hetman seriously considered Mikhnovskyi as a candidate for the post of Prime Minister of the Ukrainian State. He was impressed by anti-socialist views and his recognition of the right of peasants to private ownership of land. However, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was eventually persuaded not to appoint Mikhnovskyi as prime minister, and he offered him the position of his personal adviser. The ambitious Mikhnovskyi, of course, refused this, which foretold his future fate.\n\nMykola Mikhnovskyi made a lot of efforts to transform the Hetman’s political regime into a truly popular Ukrainian government. He was the author of a series of documents criticizing the composition of the government and its policies, subordinated directly to the Hetman. Mikhnovskyi was part of the delegations that appealed to the German occupation authorities. Not trusting the socialists, Mikhnovskyi did not support the idea of a mass anti-Hetman uprising. In the end, all his attempts led to the fact that he was expelled from Ukraine to Kuban, where he became a professor in Katerynodar Cooperative University, without losing hope of returning to Kyiv."
POLITICS_SERHIY_YEFREMOV_DESC: "Serhiy Yefremov was born into a priestly family and studied at the Kyiv Theological Seminary, which, however, did not prevent him from engaging in active political and educational activities. In 1911 he became one of the 82 famous writers and public figures who signed the protest \"to the Russian society about the bloody slander of the Jews\" published in connection with the \"case of Beilis\" Having become a staunch opponent of xenophobia, anti-Semitism, and Ukrainophobia, he was repeatedly arrested by the imperial authorities. It was he who suggested the use of the name Ukrainian People’s Republic for the state that emerged in Kyiv and thus became the \"godfather\" of the UNR.\n\nIn September 1917 he headed the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Federalists.\nAfter Skoropadskyi came to power, he criticized him and perceived it as usurpation of power and revenge of pre-revolutionary reaction. He was soon forced to flee to Galicia, where he joined the Dyrektoria and became one of its prominent right-wing leaders.\n\nNow in power, the Socialist-Federalists would finally be able to pursue their policy, liberal and moderate, despite the name, which was rather a tribute to the times."
POLITICS_ANDRIY_NIKOVSKYI_DESC: "Andriy Nikovskyi came from a family of peasants and petty bourgeoisie in Kherson province. He studied at the University of Novorossiyske, first at the Natural Sciences Department, then at the Slavonic-Russian Department of History and Philology. After graduation, he worked for one year as a teacher of Russian language and literature, but soon left for Kyiv to work as an editor of the newspaper \"Rada\". He was also the secretary of the \"Prosvita\" in Odesa.\n\nAfter the Hetman came to power, he participated in the creation of the Ukrainian National Union, which was preparing a coup against Skoropadskyi and became its first head. However, in September he was replaced by Volodymyr Vynnychenko, after which the UNS turned into the Dyrektoria.\n\nNikovskyi collaborated with Serhiy Yefremov and worked with him in the Kyiv newspaper Rada. In exile in Galicia he became one of the leaders of the ULD(S-F)."
POLITICS_OLEKSANDER_SHULHYN_DESC: "Born in Poltava Region, coming from the elder Cossack family, related to the Polubotky, the Skoropadskyi and the Apostol families, Oleksandr Shulhyn is a socio-political activist, one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Liberal-Democrats. During his short political career in the early days of the Ukrainian People's Republic, Shulhyn managed to serve as general secretary of international affairs, co-authored the Statute of the Supreme Administration of Ukraine and co-organized the Congress of the Enslaved Peoples of Russia. During his short, but successful foreign policy leadership, Ukraine was de-facto recognized by Britain and France and de-jure - by Central Powers.\n\nIn exile, Shulhyn headed the Extraordinary Diplomatic Mission of the Ukrainian People's Republic in the United Kingdom, which however ended with the British Revolution. Becoming an author of reports on the history of Ukrainian statehood and the activities of the UNR government-in-exile, he continuously criticized the Hetmanate regime and managed to be elected as the nation's prime-minister with the landslide victory of ULD(S-F). Being a skillful diplomat and master in foreign affairs, Shulhyn is looking forward to securing Ukraine's position in the world and establishing it as a leading democratic power in Eastern Europe."
POLITICS_VSEVOLOD_HOLUBOVYCH_DESC: "The youngest Ukrainian prime minister in history became head of government shortly before his 33rd birthday. Fellow politicians did not speak of him in the best words. A Scoundrel is a common word addressed to the Ukrainian Prime Minister in 1918.\n\nHe was no stranger to politics. He participated in the Revolutionary Ukrainian Party and even received administrative penalties in 1905.\n\nSince 1912 he joined the circle of Ukrainian SRs. In 1915 he went to work for the railroad. In 1916, he moved to the position of head of the department of water, highway and dirt roads of the Romanian Front. There he built roads for the military. Probably, at this time he was not up to political pursuits.\n\nThe revolution of 1917 opened up new opportunities. He was eagerly invited to join the revived Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. More and more often he was seen at pro–Ukrainian events in the city - rallies and meetings. He created an Odesa department of the UPSR amongst the railway workers of the Odesa railway network and soon was elected as the head of the Odesa City Council. Quickly rising in ranks, Holubovych soon found himself as the head of Ukrainian Government after the poor management of the Vynnychenko’s government. He also headed the Ukrainian delegation to 'Brest-Litovsk', after which he returned triumphant, but soon became the main culprit of the Austro-German occupation of Ukraine and a German-backed coup of Hetman Skoropadskyi. On April 29, 1918, he was arrested by the Germans for his participation in the kidnapping of the pro-German banker A. Dobry. In 1919, a German military court sentenced Holubovych to 2 years in prison.\n\nAfter his release in 1921 he left Ukraine for Galicia, where he joined the Dyrektoria. However, his reputation stayed with him, despite his prison sentence, and if elected once again, it is likely that much pressure and suspicion would be put on him."
POLITICS_LEVKO_KOVALIV_DESC: "Levko Kovaliv became one of the leaders of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries and member of the Central Committee of the party in 1917. In 1918, together with Oleksandr Shumskyi, Panas Liubchenko and others, he joined the left fraction of the party, which soon became known as Borotbysts. During the Hetmanate, he headed the work of underground counter-intelligence. The struggle of the revolutionary forces against the Hetman's power was a significant destabilizing force, which hindered Hetmanate's ability to act according to their own plans. Unfortunately, not a single political party was able to organize a large-scale anti-Hetman uprising at that time due to the lack of an all-Ukrainian revolutionary and political center. Borotbysts failed to take the peasant uprising into their own hands. Soon enough all socialist-minded politicians in Ukraine were forced to exile by the Skoropadskyi’s Derzhavna Varta and German forces.\n\nIn emigration, he diverged in views with Oleksandr Shumskyi, leader of the Borotbysts, who refused cooperation with other socialist parties and insisted on continuing the revolutionary struggle against the Hetman regime. Instead, Kovaliv, believed that cooperation with other socialist parties is a necessary step to overthrow the Hetman. On this basis, he returned to the UPSR, where he headed the left faction and promoted pro-Borotbyst views among the party members.\n\nNow, elected as party head, there are even fewer contradictions between the two parties and their unification is closer than ever."
POLITICS_MYKOLA_KOVALEVSKYI_DESC: "Mykola Kovalevskyi joined the Kyiv Committee of Ukrainian SRs in 1914. He co-authored the project of the party program, participated in the preparation of a protest demonstration against the Tsar's ban on celebrating the 100th anniversary of T. Shevchenko's birthday and later worked in a cooperative in Poltava.\n\nIn 1917 he became an active participant in Ukrainian revolution - as a member of the Ukrainian Central Rada and member of the Central Committee of the Ukrainian Selianska Spilka. He also served as the Minister of Land Affairs\n\nIn 1920 he was forced into emigration. At first he lived in Vienna, but soon moved to Galicia in order to join Dyrektoria, where he became the most likely candidate for the Minister of Land Affairs.\n\nNow, elected as the new Prime Minister, Kovalevskyi will focus on the final resolution of the land issue in Ukraine."
POLITICS_PAVLO_KHRISTIUK_DESC: "Born in a Kuban Cossack family, Pavlo Khristiuk, has become actively involved in political life when he was just 22. He became a proponent of Ukrainian cultural development and tried his best to achieve it as far as possible. Among others, he signed a letter addressed to a member of the Russian Imperial State Duma, which reflected the well-founded anxiety of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, caused by constant and purposeful Russification policy of the tsarist government.\nLater joining the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party, he became a leading member of its Central Committee and the Selianska Spilka and a minister of internal affairs in the government of Vsevolod Holubovych in 1918.\n\nIn 1919, among other Ukrainian SR members, he emigrated to Vienna, where he stayed for some time and worker as an co-editor of the 'Boritesia - Poborete' magazine. He later went to Lviv, where he actively hepled the local cooperative movement, combining it with his work in the Dyrektoria.\n\nNow, elected as the Ukrainian head of state, Khristiuk is willing to make Ukraine a truly people's republic with strong national identity and healthy and happy nation."
POLITICS_MYKYTA_SHAPOVAL_DESC: "Mykyta Shapoval is not just a politician. Known as a publicist, sociologist, a poet, and even as a forester by his profession, Shapoval became one of the leaders of the 'centrist faction' in the Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary party in exile. Unlike the other Dyrektoria members, he spent much of the recent years in Prague, where he became well-known as an organizer of the All-Ukrainian Workers' Union of Bohemia, co-creator of Ukrainian higher schools in Prague and head of the Ukrainian Sociological Institute in Prague, thanks to the support of T.Masaryk.\n\nIn his own party he is well known to be a socialist demagogue and a populist. Whether his 'presidency' will show any tangible results is yet to be seen."
POLITICS_MYKHAILO_HRUSHEVSKYI_DESC: "On November 7, 1918, the chairman of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, has proclaimed the Ukrainian People's Republic...\n\nJust a few months before, a well-known Ukrainian historian, author of the ten-volume monograph \"History of Ukraine-Rus\", which caused a great deal of acute scientific disputes and demagoguery, Mykhailo Hrushevskyi had been elected the chairman of Rada.\nHrushevskyi, a liberal democrat before the Revolution, soon made the Ukrainian SRs his main support and began to fulfill the cardinal political task of his movement - the formation of national statehood, initially in the form of national—territorial autonomy of Ukraine in Russia, which was later supposed to be transformed into a treaty federation. However, everything changed soon - or even too soon. With the Bolshevik revolution in Russia - Ukraine first declared its independence, just to became a German protectorate a few months later.\n\nIn 1919 Hrushevskyi left for Austria and established Ukrainian Sociological Institute in Vienna, distancing himself from the Dyrektoria's political intrigues. Nevertheless, he stayed as an active member of the Ukrainian SR Party, and with People's Republics flags waving over Kyiv, he was invited to lead the Ukrainian government once again."
POLITICS_CENTRAL_RADA_DESC: "Ukrainian Law says that if the office of the Prime-Minister is vacant, the Ukrainian Parliament becomes a collective executive institution until the new government is appointed."
POLITICS_YEVHEN_PETRUSHEVYCH_DESC: "Yevhen Petrushevych is a real mastodon in Western Ukrainian politics. He was a talented organizer of socio-political and cultural-educational life in Eastern Galicia, chairman of the district "Prosvita" and a fighter against "Muscovophilia", widespread in the Sokal region in those years. He won the favor of the broad masses by his professional defense against the arbitrariness of the authorities as a lawyer.\nIn the first elections to the Austrian parliament in 1907 he became ambassador for a large constituency in Eastern Galicia. Among the 30 Ukrainian deputies he became one of the leaders, the chairman of the Ukrainian parliamentary representation, whose speeches at the sessions were distinguished by purposefulness and deep argumentation. He did not hesitate to criticize the policy of the Austrian government in the national question and insistently demanded reforms, first of all in the electoral sphere. Thanks to Petrushevych’s activities, Ukrainians became more involved in leadership positions in local and regional institutions, and he even achieved the appointment of Ukrainians to leadership positions in the Austrian government. \n\nTogether with parliamentarians from the Czech Republic and Slovakia, Petrushevych worked out and submitted to Emperor Charles a plan for restructuring the Austro-Hungarian Empire, transforming it into a federation of free nations with the prospect of forming national states in alliance with Austria, which soon happened, though partially.\nDuring the last 16 years after the war, Petrushevych achieved the creation of the Ukrainian Galician Army as a unit of the Austrian armed forces, as well as the favor of the emperor on the issue of the UNR government in exile in Galicia. However, the Ukrainians never received the promise of broad autonomy, which significantly undermined confidence in the Austrians.\n\nNow, having proclaimed the sovereignty of the Western Ukrainian People’s Republic, there is no doubt that, under Petrushevych’s leadership, these lands will finally reunite with their brothers in Kyiv."
POLITICS_SYMON_PETLIURA_DESC: "A native of Poltava, Symon Petliura, is known as an impulsive person, prone to noisy effects, yet pragmatic and rational. A member of USDRP, rather socialist-minded politician became the first military minister of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, the creator of the first national armed forces of Ukraine. Unlike his fellow party member Vynnychenko, Petliura believed that only a professional regular army will help to win Ukrainian independence. With his special regiment of Haidamaks, Petliura played a major role in suppressing the 'Arsenal' industrial plant and liquidation of last remnants of Bolshevik uprising.\n\nAfter the Hetman’s Coup, Petliura together with other social-democrats began to establish shadow structures of opposition across the country, preparing an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi. But as most socialist leaders were arrested or exiled, the uprising never happened and Petliura was forced to flee to Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nBeing one of the leaders of the exiled forces, Petliura patiently waits for the right moment for a coup. But should the socialists once again turn against Ukrainians, Petliura can use his connections in the army for his own good."
POLITICS_ISAAK_MAZEPA_DESC: "Isaak Mazepa was born into a petty bourgeois family of Cossack origin. His father ensured his son's education in the theological seminary in Chernihiv. After graduating from seminary, he enrolled at the Faculty of Natural Sciences at St. Petersburg University. In St. Petersburg fate brought him together with Mykola Porsh and Symon Petliura,. Soon he joined the USDRP, of which he later became one of the leaders.\n\nAfter the formation of the Ukrainian Central Rada, Isaak did much to develop the activities of Ukrainian parties and organizations in Yekaterinoslav province. During the Hetmanate, when the persecution of active Ukrainian movement members began in Yekaterinoslav, Mazepa, working in the provincial zemstvo council, tried to protect them. In October 1918, Mazepa was arrested for editing a social-democratic newspaper and soon was fired. With the formation of the Dyrektoria as the government of the UPR in exile, Mazepa went to Galicia, where he was elected to the Central Committee of the USDRP and became its secretary. \n\nAfter Otaman Petliura's coup, he joined the Ukrainian National Union, which he created, where, along with Mykyta Shapoval, he led a leftist faction. Now at the head of the country, Mazepa was ready to change the country further in the vein of socialist democracy."
POLITICS_VOLODYMYR_VYNNYCHENKO_DESC: "Volodymyr Vynnychenko is considered by many as a founding father of Ukrainian statehood, together with Mykhailo Hrushevskyi. An author of almost all official declarations and legislation of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, he also became the first prime-minister of this formally sovereign short-lived state.\n\nAfter the Hetman’s Coup, he was arrested by the new government for trumped-up charges of supposedly taking part in organizing a coup d'etat. However, the German administration pressured Skoropadskyi to liberate him, frightened by the possibility of political destabilisation. He became the leader of the alliance of Ukrainian socialist parties, planning to organize an armed uprising against Skoropadskyi’s dictatorship with the help of Russian Bolsheviks. However, his plans were doomed to failure, and, miraculously avoiding another arrest, together with other former UPR leaders, Vynnychenko fled to Galicia and headed the UPR government in exile.\n\nAlong with Symon Petliura, he is one of the leaders of the upcoming uprising against the Hetman regime, but will he be able to hold off another attempt to create a socialist republic in Ukraine?"
POLITICS_VASYL_SHAKHRAI_DESC: "Called a \"national communist\" by his rivals, he is one of the main communist theorists of the Ukrainian national struggle. Speaking out against both nationalism and capitalism, Shakhrai fights for workers' power in Ukraine, unconstrained by imperialism and opportunistic compromises. Having a friendly relationship with Shumskyi, Shakhrai is the only person who can unite the left flank of Ukrainian politics."
POLITICS_IVAN_BAHRIANYI_DESC: ""
POLITICS_IVAN_MAISTRENKO_DESC: "Born in 1899 in the small Ukrainian town of Opyshnya, Poltava region, Ivan Maistrenko, dreaming of a Ukraine without tsarism and exploitation, actively participated in anti-Tsarist student societies, having his first experience of organizing and illegal work. This experience came in handy when the revolution began.\nJoining the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries in 1917, the young Maistrenko became firmly associated with its radical left wing, soon to be called \"Borotba\". \n\nWhen the Germans came, he fought with small units of the UNR army and Borotba partisans against the Hetman government until he became disillusioned with the possibility of a popular uprising against the Hetman government, as the German army suppressed any dissatisfied leftist forces and peasant uprisings. He made a difficult decision and moved to Galicia, a Ukrainian region, to continue the struggle in another way.\n\nSeeing the unwillingness of the policy of the Dyrektoria to organize effective political agitation in Austrian Ukraine and not supporting the right-wing and authoritarian tendencies of Petrushevych, Maistrenko and a small group of Borotbysts and Communists, joined by the left-liberal Ivan Bahrianyi and the democratic nationalist group of Petro Poltava, set out to create a strong Ukrainian leftist party that would promote Ukrainian politics in Galicia as well as in central Ukraine with the goal of uniting it into a prosperous and democratic state\n\nHowever, the creation of such a party was by no means smooth. From its inception, the URDP was split almost in half by the left wing of Maistrenko and the right wing of Bagryanyi, who worked side by side as autonomous groups, in a party that was more like an electoral coalition than a unified political entity. \n\nRepresenting the left wing of the URDP, Maistrenko was editor of the socialist magazine Vpered, where he advocated a socialist system based on market redistribution rather than central planning. While writing that the market was necessary to guard against authoritarianism, he still insisted on full socialization of the means of production and strict regulation to create a just, socialist, and democratic society for Ukraine.\n\nWith his wing of the URDP in power, Maistrenko would do anything to move Ukraine toward his vision of a truly socialist, unified, democratic republic..."

He headed one of the Serdyk divisions of Petliura.\nAfter Skoropadskyi's Coup, Hrekiv joined the opposition to Hetman's regime and headed the Ukrainian Military Society \"Batkivschyna\", that seeked to unite all oppositional pro-Ukrainian officers. While he is considered a supporter of Petliura, he served as the Chief of General Staff in Skoropadskyi's Army from October 1918 to 1921, and participated in the Army Reform. It is largely Hrekiv's merit that Skoropadskyi managed to build up a professional army. However, it was dangerous for Skoropadskyi to keep Hrekiv at such a high position. He was almost arrested for false accusations in official embezzlement, but due to Austrian mediation he was sent to train officers of the Ukrainian Galician Army in Galicia-Lodomeria. It was not until 1930, when he returned to Ukraine at the invitation of King Vasyl, his acquaintance, despite Hrekiv never supported his claims.\nNow, serving as a field general for Ukraine, Hrekiv is still seen as a dangerous element with hidden sympathies to Skoropadskyi and most of the Russophiles in the government and General Staff.§!"

After graduating from the gymnasium, he entered the Philosophy Faculty of Lviv University.\nIn the fall of 1911, he initiated and was the first to implement the idea of a Ukrainian Scout military organisation. Chmola's Plast group, along with the groups of Oleksandr Tysovskyi and Petro Franko became one of the three groups that have established the Plast - Ukrainian national scout organisation. The task of the scout organisation was the military education and training of Ukrainian youth for the future armed struggle for an independent Ukraine.\nIn 1914 he was elected the head of the student Striltsi organization, organized military exercizes and educational events, compiled the first military textbooks and created military terminology. Within a few days of the Weltkrieg, a Striltsi mobilization committee was created in Lviv, which organized the first combat hundred of the Ukrainian Sich Striltsi, under the command of centurion Chmola.

However, Pavlo Skoropadskyi was not satisfied with the role of a representative head and he took independent political steps that became a contradiction of Viacheslav Lypynskyi’s views.

At the 1st Party Congress, held in Moscow in July 1918, it was decided that the party would become a part of the RKP(b), retaining its own name. Barely an independent movement and more so a regional branch of the RKP, the so-called party’s influence has always been limited to urban centers of Eastern Ukraine, failing to consolidate their presence in other parts of the country due to their proletarian focus compared to the predominantly agrarian nature of Ukraine. To make matters worse, the main followers of the KP(b)U in Ukraine have primarily been Russian, as the chiefly agrarian nature of Ukraine, combined with previous attempts at industrialization on the Russian side, meant that the proportion of ethnic Ukrainians in the party has always been small, even less in terms of fluent Ukrainian speakers. Nevertheless, with Moscow’s support, the KP(b)U was able to carry out a military coup and seize power in the country. As advocates of harsh Bolshevik reforms aimed at forcefully bringing Ukraine back into Soviet Russia’s fold while suppressing Ukrainian separatism at all costs, the party’s popularity, already unpopular in the eyes of most Ukrainians, dropped further in the fallout of the violent takeover. Nonetheless, they were able to stabilize the situation for the time being thanks to Russian help.

Although the party was critical of the Hetman government, the allied Socialists and Doroshenko persuaded it to participate in a Hetman government in the hope of giving it a more Ukrainian and democratic character. The UPSF has split: it decided not to take responsibility for the Hetman government and set a condition - members of the Hetman government should leave the party and become non-partisan, while allowing them to rejoin the party after their term in the government expired. Party members and now non-partisan members who remained and participated in Hetman Ukraine were informally referred to as "Mistsevi", or locals.

Since then Ukraine continues to supply bread and foodstuffs to Austria and Germany, and despite the introduction of tariffs and payments, they are below market value, which leaves our agricultural economy, though flourishing, below standard and our population employed in the industry is becoming impoverished."

Most of the positions in the hetman’s army were held by Russian officers, the vast majority not of Ukrainian nationality. However, with little hope for the loyalty of the peasantry, the hetman turned to another source of replenishing his army, namely foreign mercenaries. In contrast to civil war-torn Russia, Ukraine was securely protected by Austro-Hungarian and German bayonets and was a real oasis of tranquility, which attracted a great number of officers of the former Tsarist army who formed officer volunteer detachments with a very skeptical, and sometimes hostile, attitude toward Ukrainian statehood. It was only by the end of the 1920s that Hetman managed to establish conscription, open an officers' academy and achieve minimal Ukrainianization of the armed forces. However, the political strife between the military under Hetman and the Soim, led by the king, left the Ukrainian armed forces in such disarray that they are in a dire need of reform."

The centrist-Marxist faction will try to hold the party together and promote the vision of a Democratic Socialist Republic, one of universal democracy, in both politics and economics.\n\nThe §RLeft§! in the USDRP is a faction that adheres to the ideas of Soviet democracy and Soviet communism. Rejecting the idea of a party-dominated §NUkapist§! state, they want to transfer all power to local councils. The commitment to Soviet democracy of this wing of the party makes the basic divergence from the §NUKP§! irrelevant, pushing for the elimination of the schism...\n\nThe §lRight§! wing of the USDRP believes that Ukraine is not ready for socialism - in their view, socialism is only possible in developed countries with an educated and politically strong working class. This framework forces the right to unite with bourgeois parties such as the §lULD(S-F)§! to develop production and implement a successful capitalist modernization that will lead to socialism. They will work with business and at the same time help the working class gain the political consciousness to prepare for the long and evolutionary road to a socialist society.\n\n§YWhich wing dominates the party will determine our ideology and policy.§!\nThe §MUSDRP§! is currently: [GetUSDRPPoliticalStatus]"

ukrpol_explosion.1.t: "Assassination of King Vasyl Shocks the Austrian Imperial Court"
ukrpol_explosion.1.d: "In a shocking turn of events, King Vasyl of Ukraine, a member of the Habsburg-Lothringen royal house, has been assassinated by unknown terrorists in a violent explosion. The tragic incident, which caught the Austrian Imperial Court off-guard, has caused grief among nobles and laypeople alike, casting a somber shadow over the once-formidable Austrian-Ukrainian alliance.\n\nDisappointment and anger are palpable in the Imperial Court, as whispers circulate regarding the Ukrainian government and security service, the Derzhavna Varta, failing to prevent this tragedy. Austria's ruling dynasty expected their neighbors to guarantee the safety of their kin, making the incident an unfathomable affair with potential consequences for Austria's relations with Ukraine.\n\nAs officials clamor for an immediate and thorough investigation into the circumstances surrounding King Vasyl's assassination, the Imperial Court must decide how to respond to this incident, as it has far-reaching implications for the future course of the Empire."
ukrpol_explosion.1.a: "Demand swift justice and a thorough investigation from Ukraine."

ukrpol_explosion.2.t: "Austria Demands Thorough Investigation"
ukrpol_explosion.2.d: "In a strong response to the assassination of King Vasyl, a member of the Habsburg-Lothringen royal house, the Austrian government has sent an ultimatum to Ukraine. They demand swift justice for the slain king and a thorough investigation of the incident, criticizing the inadequacies of the Ukrainian government and intelligence services in preventing this tragedy.\n\nTensions between the two countries have risen as Austria's patience runs thin. The Austrian-Ukrainian alliance teeters on the edge, with the potential to take a turn for the worse if the Ukrainian government does not deliver immediate results in response to the Austrian ultimatum."
ukrpol_explosion.2.a: "We shall start the thourough investigation."

ukrpol_explosion.3.t: "Austria Extends Investigative Assistance to Ukraine"
ukrpol_explosion.3.d: "In a show of unity and diplomatic goodwill, the Austrian government has offered their assistance in the investigation of the assassination of King Vasyl, a member of their royal house. Acknowledging the complex nature of the incident and empathizing with the Ukrainian government's challenges, Austria hopes that their contribution will expedite the process of uncovering the truth.\n\nBy extending their investigative resources, Austria demonstrates a commitment to maintaining the Austrian-Ukrainian alliance, despite the inherent tensions caused by the tragic event."

ukrpol_explosion.5.t: "Ukraine Refused Our Offer"
ukrpol_explosion.5.d: "Despite our goodwill, the Ukrainians have refused our assistance in the investigation, which potentially raises the question if the investigation is truly unbiased."
ukrpol_explosion.5.a: "We'll see."

ukrpol_explosion.6.t: "Hetman Skoropadskyi Visits [ROOT.Capital.GetName]"
ukrpol_explosion.6.d: "In an effort to save face amidst the recent diplomatic crisis, Hetman of Ukraine Pavlo Skoropadskyi has embarked on an official visit to the Austrian capital. The crisis had erupted following the tragic assassination of King Vasyl, a member of Austria's ruling dynasty, by an as-yet-unidentified group of terrorists. \n\nWith tensions between the two nations at an all-time high, Skoropadskyi's visit aims to strengthen diplomatic ties and reaffirm Ukraine's relations with Austria. The Hetman will participate in a series of high-level talks with Austrian officials, including the Emperor himself, in hopes of resolving the crisis and identifying the responsible party. \n\nThis diplomatic initiative is seen as essential to ensure regional stability, so that both nations can work together to confront their common enemies."
ukrpol_explosion.6.a: "We appreciate His Serene Highness's goodwill."

The Austrians have welcomed His Serene Higness with great honour and hoped that the investigation will reveal the truth about King Vasyl's assassination. As an addition to their goodwill and rekindling of our relations, a trade agreement was signed to mark cooperation between our nations."
ukrpol_explosion.7.a: "Great!"

ukrpol_explosion.8.t: "Austria's Cold Welcome"
ukrpol_explosion.8.d: "Despite the Hetman's visit to Austria with a goodwill, it was merely a failure. The Austrian official position was rather cold, as they are eagerly awaiting the results of the investigation about King Vasyl's assassination. As they are still cautious, the diplomatic crisis between our nation still persists."
ukrpol_explosion.8.a: "At least we've tried."

ukrpol_explosion.9.t: "Ukraine's New Government"
ukrpol_explosion.9.d: "Due to the recent crisis in Ukraine, the government of Hetman Skoropadskyi was overthrown, with the socialist-leaning republicans raising to power in a revived Ukrainian People's Republic. As we watch closely their actions, there's still an investigation of King Vasyl's assassination that we would like to hear results of. Perhaps, we should reming the new Ukrainian government of their duty."
ukrpol_explosion.9.a: "We're still waiting for the results."

ukrpol_explosion.10.t: "Austria Reminds of Investigation"
ukrpol_explosion.10.d: "The previous Hetmanist government has failed to complete the investigation on King Vasyl's death. While to many he was an Austrian impostor, some of our military leaders were acquainted with King Vasyl before he was a king - a passionate Ukrainophile, despite his Austrian blood. The government and foreign minister strongly advised us to finish the investigation to maintain good relations with Austria."
ukrpol_explosion.10.a: "Tell them we don't care..."
ukrpol_explosion.10.b: "We must not ruin our relations with Austria."

ukrpol_explosion.11.t: "Ukrainians Don't Care"

ukrpol_explosion.11.a: "Damned terrorists!"

ukrpol_explosion.12.t: "Shards of Truth"
ukrpol_explosion.12.d: "In the pursuit of unraveling the truth behind King Vasyl's assassination, our investigators have embarked on a mission to gather firsthand accounts from survivors and witnesses. These crucial testimonies will offer critical insight into the events of that horrific day. Our diligent detectives managed to identify three significant witnesses: each possessing a unique perspective on the heinous crime. \n\nMykhailo Petrenko - The Riverside Observer: Being an avid painter, Mykhailo was by the riverside capturing the scenery as the assassination occurred. Allured by the array of spectacles unfolding, he inadvertently became a witness to the disaster. Mykhailo shared that immediately after the explosion, he noticed a suspicious figure dashing away from the scene.\n\nOleksandr Ivanov - The Alert Taxi Driver: Bystander Oleksandr, a seasoned taxi driver, was crossing the river bridge just as the explosion took place. According to his account, he observed an unmarked vehicle parked near the bridge before the explosion occurred, and after the blast, it quickly sped away. Oleksandr's testimony offers potential evidence of an escape plan.\n\nSerhii Yaroslavskyi - The Resilient Sailor: Amidst the tragic loss of his crew, Serhii lived to tell the tale of the yacht caught in the sinister plot. He recalls whispers from the royal guards regarding an undelivered message and the apparent tension among them. Serhii's experience on the yacht reveals the possibility of internal discord.\n\nOur investigation continues to delve deeper into the shadows, piecing together traces of evidence. With each testimony, we hope to forge a clearer understanding of the plot that claimed the King's life. Justice may be looming on the horizon, but we cannot falter until the perpetrators are unmasked and our nation's wounds begin to heal."
ukrpol_explosion.12.a: "A figure? A car? Royal guards? Nonsense!"

ukrpol_explosion.13.t: "Unraveling the Mystery"
ukrpol_explosion.13.d: "As the team assembled to investigate the assassination of King Vasyl presses on, they have now turned their focus to the effectiveness of the King's security detail and the internal workings of the Derzhavna Varta, the intelligence service, in search of potential security breaches. The recent findings revealed two key pieces of evidence that may aid in uncovering the truth behind this tragedy.\n\nThe results of the royal guards' review: Upon examining the royal guards tasked with protecting the king during his yacht excursion, it was discovered that a small number of guards were absent from their posts at the time of the assassination. These guards have provided inconsistent explanations for their absence, raising suspicions of a potential security breach. Furthermore, Serhii Yaroslavskyi's testimony regarding the undelivered message and the tension among the guards has heightened concerns. As the investigation continues, this group of guards will be subjected to further scrutiny to uncover any possible collaboration with the assassin or negligence of duty.\n\nThe analysis of internal communications of Derzhavna Varta: Following a thorough examination of the correspondences within the intelligence service, unusual communications were observed between certain agents leading up to the day of the assassination. Although the messages were sent in code, the investigation team managed to decrypt them, revealing discussions of altering patrol routes and diversion tactics that could have been employed to aid the assassin in planting the explosives. This finding suggests that there could be a mole within the ranks of Derzhavna Varta actively providing assistance to the perpetrator.\n\nAs the investigation gains momentum, the team is hopeful that the recent discoveries will ultimately lead to the uncovering of the truth behind the assassination of King Vasyl."

ukrpol_explosion.14.t: "Tracing the Origins of the Explosive"
ukrpol_explosion.14.d: "The investigation into the assassination of King Vasyl has taken a significant turn as authorities focus on tracing the origins of the explosive device that caused the tragic incident. In their pursuit of the truth, four key pieces of evidence have emerged that may potentially identify the individuals responsible for the heinous act.\n\n1) The explosive used in the devastating attack was identified as a Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, a highly potent and powerful explosive with military-grade capabilities. The source of this explosive is still under investigation, but its sophistication suggests that the individuals behind the assassination may have been connected to or had access to high-level military resources.\n\n2) Authorities have investigated two major arms and explosive dealing hubs in their quest to uncover the perpetrators - the notorious Odesa Black Market, and the secluded underground marketplace of Kharkiv known as the Birka. While no concrete evidence was uncovered in Odesa, the Kharkiv Birka presented investigators with a lead - a dealer who allegedly sold a Ryzhkov-1 explosive to an unidentified buyer several weeks before the assassination.\n\n3) Three notable figures within the Ukrainian military are considered potential suspects due to both their motive and means to assemble and plant the explosive. These individuals are Colonel Viktor Kovalenko, Sotnik Hryhoriy Bondarenko, and Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko. Each of them held grudges against the monarchy due to personal or ideological reasons and had the expertise to execute the plan.\nColonel Viktor Kovalenko, a decorated war hero, member of the UPSS, had long been critical of King Vasyl's reign, claiming that the monarchy's existence hindered Ukraine's ability to progress and defend itself. Sotnik Hryhoriy Bondarenko, known for his ruthless methods in combat, member of the UVO, harbored resentment towards the King for refusing to provide his troops with more privileges and better equipment. Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko, an intelligence officer with extensive knowledge in covert operations, was once dismissed from a prestigious position within the palace, and was rumored to be seeking vengeance for his humiliation.\n\nWith these key pieces of evidence in hand, the investigation now pivots towards uncovering the connections between the explosive's origins and the potential suspects. As the search for truth intensifies, so does the hope for justice and resolution to a nation still reeling from the tragic loss of their beloved King Vasyl."

ukrpol_explosion.15.t: "King Vasyl Assassination Investigation Deepens"
ukrpol_explosion.15.d_intro: "With the tragic assassination of King Vasyl still sending shockwaves throughout the Kingdom, the investigation into his untimely death has begun to focus on potentially ambitious politicians and military officers who might have sought to seize power in the wake of the assassination. Building on witness accounts and the discovery of the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, the investigation committee has narrowed down five groups as the most likely masterminds behind this heinous plot."
ukrpol_explosion.15.d_borotbysts: "\n\nBorotbysts: Given their long history of subversive attacks against the Kingdom, the underground group of socialist revolutionaries known as the Borotbysts are considered prime suspects. Recent intel suggests that they may have infiltrated the royal guards, as demonstrated by the suspicious behavior and inconsistent explanations provided by certain guards during the time of the assassination. Furthermore, the sophisticated explosive used in the attack is consistent with their expertise in sabotage and guerrilla tactics."
ukrpol_explosion.15.d_dyrektoria: "\n\nDyrektoria: The exiled socialist and republican opposition, residing in Galicia-Lodomeria and Austria, has also been keenly interested in destabilizing Ukraine to ignite an uprising. Their possible involvement is supported by the testimony of painter Mykhailo Petrenko, who saw a suspicious figure fleeing the scene immediately after the explosion - potentially an agent of Dyrektoria seeking to cover their tracks."
ukrpol_explosion.15.d_upss: "\n\nBatkivshchyna and UPSS: Although they were allies of the deceased King, this nationalist-socialist republican group of military officers has long desired a shift to a different form of governance in Ukraine. The fact that the explosive was purchased by a military officer raises suspicions about their involvement. Additionally, the involvement of Colonel Viktor Kovalenko, who is critical of King Vasyl's rule, raises questions about the extent of their loyalty to the monarchy."
ukrpol_explosion.15.d_uvo: "\n\nUVO: The Ukrainian nationalists and their organization, UVO, have a strong motive to remove the King and unify nationalist military officers within the army. The sophisticated explosive suggests a high level of military expertise and access to resources, making them a potent threat. The purchase of the explosive by Sotnik Hryhoriy Bondarenko, who harbors resentment towards the King, further implicates this group as possible conspirators."
ukrpol_explosion.15.d_varta: "\n\nDerzhavna Varta: Perhaps the most troubling possibility is that the Kingdom's own intelligence service could have played a role in the assassination. Unusual communications between certain agents in the days leading up to the event suggest potential coordination to alter patrol routes and provide diversion tactics to aid the perpetrator. Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko, an intelligence officer bearing a personal grudge against the King, is notably suspicious, given his expertise in covert operations and potential access to the explosive."

ukrpol_explosion.16.t: "The Revelation of King Vasyl's Assassin"
ukrpol_explosion.16.d1: "After an exhaustive investigation into the tragic assassination of King Vasyl, the truth behind his untimely demise has finally been revealed. As King Vasyl embarked on his yacht excursion, little did he know that a cunning plan to end his life had been carefully set in motion. \n\nThe primary suspect has been identified as Sotnik Hryhoriy Bondarenko, an experienced operative and a member of the Ukrainian nationalist organization, UVO. It was discovered that Sotnik Bondarenko had purchased the sophisticated Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive at the Kharkiv secluded underground marketplace. His connections to high-ranking military officials helped him to procure this powerful weapon, and his group's vehement political goals served as motivation for the assassination plot. \n\nMany witnesses corroborate the suspicious activity leading up to the event. The painter Mykhailo Petrenko saw a suspicious figure fleeing the scene, while Oleksandr Ivanov's testimony highlighted an unmarked vehicle that quickly sped away after the explosion.\n\nFurthermore, sailor Serhii Yaroslavskyi, a survivor of the tragic yacht explosion, overheard whispers from the royal guards concerning an undelivered message and apparent tension within their ranks. Upon further investigation, it was discovered that a small group of royal guards had abandoned their posts during the assassination, providing inconsistent explanations for their absence. This confirmed a security breach within the royal guards, possibly as a result of collusion with the UVO. The analysis of Derzhavna Varta intelligence communication only heightened suspicions, revealing plans to alter patrol routes and diversion tactics.\n\nAfter extensive interrogation and examination of evidence, the investigation is now confident in its conclusion: Sotnik Hryhoriy Bondarenko, along with the aid of infiltrated royal guards, orchestrated the assassination of King Vasyl on the fateful yacht excursion. Bondarenko's successful procurement of the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, along with his group's political motivations and expert assistance from compromised guards, rendered the plot seemingly impenetrable. "
ukrpol_explosion.16.d2: "Today, the final investigation report on King Vasyl's assassination has been publicly released, revealing the complete history of the plot and the identity of the perpetrator. The assassin has been identified as Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko, a high-ranking officer in the Derzhavna Varta intelligence service, who was previously noted for his personal grudge against the King.\n\nThe investigation revealed that Osavul Zinchenko was responsible for leaking sensitive information about the royal security arrangements to a secretive underground organization, known as the Borotbysts, who had a history of subversive attacks against the Kingdom. They provided Zinchenko with the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, a sophisticated weapon that could only be obtained through high-level military connections, which was then acquired at a secluded underground marketplace in Kharkiv. On the day of the assassination, Zinchenko planted the explosive on King Vasyl's yacht, using the diversion tactics and altered patrol routes that she had helped orchestrate.\n\nThe explosion that took place during the King's yacht excursion was witnessed by several individuals, including painter Mykhailo Petrenko, who saw a suspicious figure leaving the scene of the crime. Additionally, Oleksandr Ivanov, a taxi driver on the river bridge, spotted an unmarked vehicle speeding away from the explosion site. It is suggested that the vehicle was driven by members of the Borotbysts, ensuring Zinchenko's escape from the scene.\n\nFurthermore, the investigation disclosed that some royal guards, potentially infiltrated by Borotbysts, were absent from their posts during the assassination. These guards provided inconsistent explanations for their absence, raising suspicions of a security breach. Sailor Serhii Yaroslavskyi, who survived the explosion, recalls whispers among the royal guards regarding an undelivered message and tension among them.\n\nThe investigation report also takes note of various domestic rivals who may have taken part in and who could have benefited from the assassination. However, the evidence provided overwhelmingly points towards Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko and his collaboration with the Borotbysts as the primary culprits behind the tragic assassination of King Vasyl."
ukrpol_explosion.16.d3: "After months of meticulous investigation and persistent efforts to unveil the truth behind the shocking assassination of King Vasyl, it seems that our long-awaited answers have finally arrived. The collected testimonies, evidence, and continuous analysis have led the royal investigators to a chilling conclusion that the assassin responsible for the tragic incident is none other than Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko, a rogue intelligence officer from the Derzhavna Varta.\n\nZinchenko had both the motive and opportunity to commit this heinous act, harboring a personal grudge against King Vasyl and possessing an extensive knowledge of covert operations. The damning intelligence communications revealed discussions within Derzhavna Varta that hinted at altering patrol routes and diversion tactics, which would have effectively aided Zinchenko in planting the highly advanced Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive acquired from a secluded underground marketplace in Kharkiv.\n\nThe day of the assassination appeared to be meticulously planned out, as key royal guards found to be absent from their posts provided inconsistent explanations about their whereabouts during this critical time. This potential security breach further supports the hypothesis that elements within the Derzhavna Varta itself were involved in collaborating with Zinchenko to orchestrate this devastating attack.\n\nWhen the fateful moment arrived, Zinchenko is believed to have remotely detonated the explosive, annihilating the yacht and claiming the life of King Vasyl. According to eyewitnesses, a suspicious figure was seen fleeing the scene immediately after the explosion, while an unmarked vehicle previously parked near the bridge made a hasty escape. Both of these observations correspond to Zinchenko's potential movements following the assassination.\n\nWhile suspicions initially fell on domestic rivals, it seems that the most tangible threat came from within the very institution sworn to protect the Kingdom and its ruler. With this newfound knowledge, the assassins' connections and potential collaborators will be investigated further as the nation mourns the tragic loss of King Vasyl and seeks justice for his untimely demise."
ukrpol_explosion.16.d4: "After weeks of thorough investigation and gathering data from various sources, our team of top investigators have finally pieced together the sequence of events that led to the tragic assassination of King Vasyl during his yacht excursion. The assassin has been identified as one Pavlo Tkachenko, a former military officer with deep connections to Dyrektoria exiles, who opposed King Vasyl's rule.\n\nPavlo Tkachenko managed to acquire the rare Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive from a secluded underground marketplace in Kharkiv due to his connections with high-ranking military officers. He then smuggled the explosive into the city, using his network of contacts within the royal guard to plant the explosive on King Vasyl's yacht without raising suspicion. It is believed that the undelivered message, as mentioned by sailor Serhii Yaroslavskyi, could have been a warning or indication of the explosive's presence on the yacht.\n\nTkachenko's connection to the royal guards was crucial in successfully altering their patrol routes and implementing diversion tactics, allowing him to plant the explosives on the yacht unnoticed. It is now evident that the absent royal guards were, in fact, accomplices to the assassination, knowingly or unknowingly aiding Pavlo Tkachenko in his endeavor.\n\nOn the day of the assassination, as the yacht set out, Pavlo Tkachenko stationed himself near the river bridge, awaiting the perfect moment to detonate the explosive. He used an unmarked vehicle, as observed by taxi driver Oleksandr Ivanov, to quickly escape the scene once his plan was executed. Painter Mykhailo Petrenko's testimony of a suspicious figure dashing away from the scene aligns with the escape of Tkachenko from the assassination site.\n\nOur investigation has also uncovered the motive behind this deplorable act. Pavlo Tkachenko, with his connections to Dyrektoria, was associated with socialist and republican opposition groups in Galicia-Lodomeria and Austria that sought to destabilize Ukraine and incite an uprising. Furthermore, Tkachenko's connections with the Army, have uncovered a faction within the military officers who longed for a change in governance.\n\nThe evidence collected provides a comprehensive account of King Vasyl's assassination, implicating Pavlo Tkachenko and the Dyrektoria exiles. Justice will now be sought for the King Vasyl, and those responsible will face the consequences of their actions."
ukrpol_explosion.16.d5: "As the investigation into King Vasyl's assassination reaches its closing stages, the truth behind the tragic affair finally comes to light. The assassin has been identified as Colonel Viktor Kovalenko, a member of the Batkivshchyna and UPSS. The investigation found that the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive used in the attack was acquired by Kovalenko through his military connections and purchased at a secluded underground marketplace in Kharkiv. \n\nPainter Mykhailo Petrenko's testimony proved vital to the case, as he recalled witnessing a suspicious figure, now believed to be Kovalenko, fleeing the scene immediately after the explosion. Meanwhile, taxi driver Oleksandr Ivanov's account of an unmarked vehicle near the river bridge, which sped away shortly after the blast, was also key in connecting Kovalenko's escape plan. \n\nFurthermore, the investigation exposed a security breach within the royal guards. Some of them, who were later identified as sympathizers of Batkivshchyna and UPSS, tampered with patrol routes and utilized diversion tactics to allow the assassin to plant the explosives on the yacht..\n\nMoreover, the surviving sailor Serhii Yaroslavskyi's testimony about whispers amongst the royal guards, and the undelivered message – now confirmed to be an anonymous tip about the impending assassination – added to the increasing body of evidence pointing towards an inside job. \n\nInvestigators pieced together a compelling narrative of the events leading up to King Vasyl's assassination. Acting on orders from key members of Batkivshchyna and UPSS, Colonel Viktor Kovalenko used his military connections to acquire the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, effectively bypassing security measures to plant it on the yacht. His accomplices within the royal guards provided invaluable assistance, making sure the plot went undiscovered by tampering with patrol routes and creating diversions. Once the explosives were successfully planted, Kovalenko positioned himself nearby and remotely detonated the device, taking King Vasyl's life and plunging the nation into turmoil."

ukrpol_explosion.17.t: "The Shadow of the Order"
ukrpol_explosion.17.d1: "After years of incessant examination of the assassination of King Vasyl, investigator Serhiy Matviyenko began to piece together a perplexing puzzle. His independent research had uncovered the true masterminds behind the assassination - not the UVO, as previously believed. Serhiy's determination to uncover the truth led him to stumble upon the so-called 'Order of Ancients', a shadowy organization believed to be rooted in old Mediterranean aristocracy.\n\nThe organization saw a great opportunity in the turmoil gripping Ukraine, seeking to destabilize the region further to advance their own interests. This secret cabal of influential and powerful masterminds saw in Sotnik Hryhoriy Bondarenko, a desperate pawn, easily manipulated by the promise of a country aligned to their vision.\n\nIn a file discovered in Serhiy's possession, a letter from an unknown source detailed the extent of the conspiracy. The Order meticulously established a network within Ukraine, targeting key guards, infiltrating the UVO, and financing the procurement of the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive.\n\nCrucial to the success of this operation was the Royal Guard's betrayal. It was the Order who carefully sowed dissent and manipulated the guards, turning them against their King and ensuring their cooperation on that fateful day.\n\nThe elaborate plot concluded on the yacht excursion. With Bondarenko's group in place and the Royal Guard compromised, the Order put their plan into motion. The explosion occurred with devastating precision, tearing the yacht and King Vasyl's life apart, causing shockwaves across the nation."
ukrpol_explosion.17.d2: "Years after the conclusion of the official investigation into King Vasyl's assassination, new evidence has come to light, revealing the involvement of a previously unknown organization: the Order of Ancients. An investigator, unable to shake the feeling that something was amiss, dedicated his life to unraveling the mystery and stumbled upon a conspiracy darker than anyone could have imagined.\n\nThe investigator discovered that Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko was, in fact, a pawn in a far greater scheme orchestrated by the enigmatic Order. The secretive organization was behind the manipulations of the Borotbysts, using them as a scapegoat to throw off any suspicions regarding their involvement. The Order had targeted King Vasyl as he posed a significant obstacle to their ultimate goal: the destabilization of Ukraine.\n\nThrough their covert network of agents, the Order had infiltrated the Derzhavna Varta and coerced Zinchenko into carrying out the assassination. The Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive had been supplied by their operatives, eerily similar to weapons found across Mediterranean military arsenals. Furthermore, the unmarked vehicle that sped away from the scene bore a distinctive emblem – a Snake wrapped around the Yggdrasil – confirming the Order's involvement.\n\nAs the true depth of the conspiracy becomes clear, it is now up to the government to decide whether to reveal this shocking truth to the public, or keep it a closely guarded secret in the interest of maintaining stability within the nation."
ukrpol_explosion.17.d3: "Years have passed since the assassination of King Vasyl, but the recent unexpected developments have cast doubt on the circumstances of the tragic incident. A dedicated investigator who has spent the past several years working independently has come forward with a new theory, offering an alternative perspective on the roles played by Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko and rogue elements within the Derzhavna Varta.\n\nAccording to this investigator, Zinchenko was merely a pawn in a much larger conspiracy orchestrated by a secretive Mediterranean organization known as the Order of Ancients. This shadowy group, driven by motivations that are unclear at this time, apparently sought to destabilize our nation and foment chaos in our region. The deranged efforts of the Order were facilitated by their recruiting key elements within the Derzhavna Varta and exploiting Zinchenko's personal grievances against King Vasyl.\n\nThrough a series of elaborate deceptions and manipulations crafted by the Order, Zinchenko was convinced that he was acting on behalf of the greater good, unaware of the true identity of those pulling the strings. As a result, Zinchenko unwittingly carried out their diabolical plot, furthering the interests of the Order and threatening the very foundation of our kingdom.\n\nIn light of these new findings, it is now evident that our previous conclusions concerning Zinchenko's motivations and affiliations were misguided - the true masterminds behind King Vasyl's assassination have yet to be brought to justice."
ukrpol_explosion.17.d4: "Years have passed since the assassination of King Vasyl and with it, the punishment of Pavlo Tkachenko and his accomplices. The case was previously considered closed, until seasoned investigator Bohdan Shumovskyi started having doubts about the official account of events. He began a tireless, independent investigation, attempting to delve deeper into the conspiracy. \n\nAfter years of pursuing leads, Bohdan has stumbled upon new evidence, revealing the truth behind the assassination: the real masterminds who orchestrated the tragic event were none other than a secret Mediterranean organization known as the Order of Ancients.\n\nThe Order had been seeking to destabilize the European nations to further their own agenda. With their eyes set on Ukraine, they exploited the nationalistic and socialist sentiments of the Dyrektoria exiles, including Pavlo Tkachenko, and coerced them into taking part in the assassination plot.\n\nThe organization provided both financial and logistical support, from the procurement of the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive to the enlisting of royal guards to aid in the plot. They were also responsible for fabricating the connections between Tkachenko and the greater socialist movement in Ukraine and Austria, further clouding the investigation. \n\nWhat was initially seen as a purely nationalistic and socialist-fueled assassination has been revealed to be a carefully crafted scheme, designed by a shadowy international organization. The Order left no traces of their involvement, allowing the scapegoats - Tkachenko and the Dyrektoria - to take the fall for their heinous act."
ukrpol_explosion.17.d5: "As the nation moves on from the tragedy of King Vasyl and the condemnation of Colonel Viktor Kovalenko, a persistent investigator, Andriy Fedorovych, who worked on the initial investigation, has spent years conducting his own independent research. Fedorovych harbored suspicions that there was a deeper truth behind the assassination than the official narrative allowed.\n\nAfter following a trail of barely discernible breadcrumbs, Fedorovych unexpectedly uncovered connections between the Batkivshchyna, UPSS, and a secret Mediterranean organization known as the Order of Ancients. This enigmatic group, operating behind the scenes for centuries, aimed to destabilize nations and create chaos to further their own obscure agenda. \n\nFedorovych's discoveries brought to the light that the Order had orchestrated and financed the assassination of King Vasyl from the shadows. The organization carefully manipulated key members of Batkivshchyna and UPSS against the monarchy, providing them with resources and information to draft Colonel Kovalenko and his accomplices.\n\nThe Order's involvement explained why certain aspects of the case never seemed to fully add up, such as the ease with which a military-grade explosive was acquired and used in the assassination. It also revealed the true extent of infiltration and manipulation by foreign powers within the Ukrainian government and military.\n\nFedorovych's findings have been met with both skepticism and support. Some see it as an attempt to scapegoat foreign agents and deflect blame from the obvious culprits, while others view it as a revelation of a far-reaching conspiracy that could topple those in power. Regardless of the truth, the memory of King Vasyl and the doubts surrounding his assassination will continue to haunt our nation. Though justice has been served in part with the punishment of Kovalenko and his collaborators, the revelation of the Order's involvement raises even more questions and leaves a lingering sense of unease."

ukrpol_explosion.18.t: "The Truth Behind King Vasyl's Assassination Revealed"
ukrpol_explosion.18.d1: "After months of tireless work, the Ukrainian government has finally unveiled the dark truth behind the assassination of King Vasyl at an urgent meeting with Austrian officials in the majestic Hofburg Palace. The gathered representatives listen intently as the Head of the Investigation Committee recounts the chilling details of Sotnik Hryhoriy Bondarenko's plot to bring about the King's untimely end during his fateful yacht excursion.\n\nEvidence of Sotnik Bondarenko's procurement of the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, the suspicious activity leading up to the event, and collaboration from royal guards have all been presented, connecting the dots in the meticulously planned assassination. The Committee attests that the staunchly nationalist organization UVO's political goals served as the driving force for this act of violent treachery.\n\nAs the Austrian authorities process this shattering revelation, it is clear that their once-close ally Ukraine has been compromised by shadowy forces seeking to undermine the Habsburg monarchy. The gathered officials cannot help but feel that this tragedy marks a turning point for their relationship with Ukraine, and the fragile world order."
ukrpol_explosion.18.d2: "A significant breakthrough has occurred in the investigation of King Vasyl's assassination – Ukrainian authorities have presented a final report to Austria, revealing the complete history of the plot and the identity of the main perpetrator. Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko, a high-ranking officer in the Derzhavna Varta intelligence service, has been identified as the mastermind behind the assassination, in collaboration with the secretive underground organization – the Borotbysts.\n\nThe report details how Zinchenko orchestrated the attack by acquiring a sophisticated weapon, the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, and planting it on the King's yacht during a critical diversion. Moreover, the investigation unveils an alleged security breach caused by Borotbysts infiltrating the royal guards. Numerous witness testimonies point towards Zinchenko's involvement and his elaborate escape plan following the explosion.\n\nThe findings presented in the report are indisputable and have sparked outrage among the people of Ukraine, as well as the Austrian government. This revelation has initiated a demand for justice against the conspirators responsible for the tragic assassination of beloved King Vasyl."
ukrpol_explosion.18.d3: "After months of meticulous investigation and persistent efforts to unveil the truth behind the shocking assassination of King Vasyl, the Government of Ukraine has reached out to us to present the official results of their inquiry. Initially, many had suspected foul play from Ukraine's domestic enemies. However, the evidence that has come to light now paints an unsettling picture, one that implicates rogue elements within the Ukrainian intelligence agency, Derzhavna Varta.\n\nAccording to the investigation's findings, the assassin responsible for the tragic incident is Osavul Oleksandr Zinchenko, a rogue intelligence officer possessing a personal grudge against King Vasyl and an extensive knowledge of covert operations. Evidence of communication within Derzhavna Varta points to a planned security breach to facilitate planting a powerful explosive acquired from a secluded underground marketplace in Kharkiv.\n\nThis explosive, known as the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive, was planted on King Vasyl's yacht, and Zinchenko is believed to have remotely detonated it on the fateful day. The official report presents the testimony of eyewitnesses who observed a suspicious figure and unmarked vehicle fleeing the scene shortly after the explosion.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has expressed its deepest condolences over the loss of King Vasyl and vows to bring all those connected with this deplorable act to justice. With these findings, it seems that the most immediate threat to the lives of our esteemed leaders may, in fact, come from within the very institutions we rely on for their protection.\n\nWe are left to grapple with these unsettling revelations as we mourn the tragic loss of King Vasyl and seek justice in his name."
ukrpol_explosion.18.d4: "After weeks of painstaking investigation, the Ukrainian government has finally released their findings concerning the assassination of King Vasyl. The evidence overwhelmingly points to the involvement of the Dyrektoria, a group of exiled socialist and republican opposition figures based in Austria, particularly Galicia-Lodomeria.\n\nUpon presenting the results of the investigation to the Austrian government, the Ukrainian authorities are now urging Austria to take necessary action against the Dyrektoria exiles. This development puts Vienna in a precarious situation, as they have been granting asylum to the exiles in question, who sought to destabilize Ukraine in order to ignite an uprising.\n\nThe Ukrainian government demands that the conspirators be extradited to Ukraine to face justice for their heinous crime. The Austrian government is faced with a difficult choice - giving in to Ukrainian demands may harm their relations with the exiled Dyrektoria, who may have sympathizers in Austria itself. However, refusal to cooperate with Ukraine might significantly damage Austrian-Ukrainian relations and possibly provoke additional conflict in the region."
ukrpol_explosion.18.d5: "The tragic assassination of King Vasyl has been a shadow cast over our relations with Ukraine since that fateful day. Now, as the investigation into the reprehensible act reaches its conclusion, the truth behind the affair finally comes to light, with the Ukrainian government presenting their findings to our Empire.\n\nAccording to the official report, the assassin has been identified as Colonel Viktor Kovalenko, a member of the Batkivshchyna and UPSS. The investigation found that he acquired the Ryzhkov-1 Anti-Ship Explosive used in the attack through his military connections and purchased at an underground marketplace in Kharkiv. It seems that several individuals played key roles in piecing together this tragic puzzle, with testimony from painter Mykhailo Petrenko and taxi driver Oleksandr Ivanov proving vital to the case.\n\nWhat comes as most shocking, however, is the revelation of a security breach within the royal guards, with some identified as sympathizers of Batkivshchyna and UPSS. These individuals deliberately tampered with patrol routes and utilized diversion tactics to allow the assassin to plant the explosives on the yacht. The surviving sailor Serhii Yaroslavskyi's testimony about whispers amongst the guards and the undelivered message warning of the impending assassination appear to confirm suspicions of an inside job.\n\nThe narrative that emerges from the investigation is a chilling one. Acting on orders from key members of Batkivshchyna and UPSS, Colonel Viktor Kovalenko used his military connections to acquire the explosives, effectively bypassing security measures to plant them on the yacht. His accomplices within the royal guards provided invaluable assistance, making sure the plot went undiscovered.

### New Events ###
ukrpol.1.t: "Our Kingdom"
ukrpol.1.d: "In the political chaos of Russia's Civil War, a new nation was founded. A nation built upon centuries of dreamers and philosophers: the nation of Ukraine.\n\nFirst declared independent in January 1918, the self-declared Ukrainian People's Republic signed the notorious 'Bread Peace' or Treaty of Berestia and became a virtual protectorate of the German Empire. At the time, this was seen as a small price to pay for German and Austro-Hungarian troops driving the Bolsheviks out of Kyiv and back to Russia. Ukraine became the breadbasket of the Central Powers, shipping grain back to Germany and Austria to feed their starving populations. However, German fears of impending defeat on the Western Front and promises of sweeping land reform from the People's Republic persuaded German command to change their policy.\n\nOn the 29th of April, 1918, a German backed coup overthrew the Ukrainian People's Republic, and in its place established the Ukrainian State under the leadership of Ukrainian General Pavlo Skoropadskyi. Proclaimed Hetman, Skoropadskyi transformed Ukraine into a military dictatorship. Reforms under the People's Republic were reversed, land confiscated during the UNR's tenure was returned to the upper class of landowners, and the Hetman became the undisputed leader of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, German aid soon turned into payment of informal debts to the allies for the Hetman. For some time, the dispute between Germany and its Austro-Hungarian ally continued after the Weltkrieg, eventually settling on a compromise according to which King Vasyl, the Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, would rule with the support of Skoropadskyi, who, as a German-allied \"Hetman\", has incredible powers both in civil and military matters. In fact, the Hetman still remained practically the sole ruler of Ukraine, limited only by the King and the Soim, which is increasingly dissatisfied with Skoropadskyi’s policy.\n\nNow, almost twenty years after the Weltkrieg, the situation in the country is unstable. The Kaiserreich forces us to sell our goods almost exclusively to countries within its sphere of influence, while syndicalists are gaining popularity every day among the oppressed rural poor and urban workers. Despite these many problems we face, our land is prosperous and fertile, our people are hardworking, and our potential is limitless."
ukrpol.1.a: "Shche Ne Vmerla Ukraina!"

ukrpol.2.t: "The Hetman"
ukrpol.2.d: "The role of the Hetman of Ukraine - the permanent Pavlo Skoropadskyi in domestic and foreign policy is very great. He is the supreme head of the state, the army and the judiciary. State administration was carried out by the Government appointed by him. Pavlo Skoropadskyi was proclaimed the guarantor of order and legality before the elections of the Ukrainian Soim. \n\nHowever, everything changed in 1927. As a result of the compromise of Germany with Austria-Hungary during the 1927 Ausgleich, the political system of the Hetmanate changed. Austrian Archduke Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg, was crowned in Kyiv as King Vasyl, elections were held to the new Ukrainian Soim. As a result of all this, the Hetman’s power was limited, although he continued to be the supreme leader and commander-in-chief, and none of the decisions were made without his approval. The parties of the Soim that existed under strict control soon became quite oppositional and stopped seeing the Hetman as the only possible ruler of Ukraine. His desire for sole power rejected them and hindered the emerging ideology of Ukrainian monarchism and conservatism, which saw the Hetman as an exclusively symbolic figure.\n\nThe Hetman sees the future of Ukraine only in increasing his own power and turning the country into a real Hetmanate with himself at the head. And there would be practically no obstacles to this if it were not for the Soim and the King."
ukrpol.2.a: "Zghynut Nashi Vorohy, Yak Rosa Na Sontsi"

ukrpol.3.t: "The King"
ukrpol.3.d: "Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen is known to many as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. By many he is regarded as a symbol of foreign dominance, imposed on Ukraine as a result of a compromise between Germany and Austria. However, the others know, that Vasyl is fascinated by Ukrainian culture, he writes and speaks Ukrainian, and there is not a single argument, except for his origin, that he is not worthy of the throne of Ukraine. Even before he became Vasyl Vyshyvanyi, he received the nickname \"The Red Prince\" for his desire to improve the living conditions of the poor Ukrainian population of Galicia.\n\nFor almost 15 years, the Hetman of Ukraine has been doing everything to marginalize the King, and not giving him the opportunity to show his best side. Therefore, the only support and hope of Vasyl is Austria and the Ukrainian Soim. Of the several parties sitting there, Vasyl has long been an integral figure of the new Ukrainian Statehood. Having got rid of the Hetman, the authorities in the country will finally be able to rely on the ideas of Ukrainian Conservatism, maybe even allow Vasyl to throw off the foreign stigma of the \"King\" and become a real Hetman of Ukraine."
ukrpol.3.a: "Schob Vernuty Iyi Chest, Liazhem Holovamy"

ukrpol.300.t: "The Soim"
ukrpol.300.d: "The Ukrainian Soim, convened in 1927 shortly after the coronation of King Vasyl, was the hope not only of His Majesty, but also of the Ukrainian people for democratic change. However, the Hetman clung too tightly to his power. In fact, the Soim is only an advisory body, for the government is formed solely by the Hetman, and any bill can easily be rejected by him. This has allowed the political system of Ukraine to be mothballed.\n\nThere are three main parties in Soim, and many candidates from corporations and organizations, as well as non-partisans. The ruling party, the Union of Hetmantsiv-Derzhavnykiv (SHD or 'Statists'), stands on firm pro-Hetman conservative positions and has Germanophile and Russophile wings, uniting mainly old tsarist ministers and landowners. The main oppositional party are the Ukrainian Union of Agrarian-Statists (USKhD or 'Khliborobs') and Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Independentists (UPSS or 'Samostiynyki').\n\nThere are also other parties that are not represented in the parliament, but have all chances to return to politics in the next elections - Dontsov's nationalists, Konovalets's militarists, as well as Doroshenko’s UPSF(m)."
ukrpol.300.a: "Nazovemsia Ukrainy Virnymy Synamy!"

ukrpol.4.t: "The Brotfrieden"
ukrpol.4.d: "The economy of Ukraine is predominantly agrarian. In 1918, Land commissions were established, including the Supreme Land Commission, chaired by Skoropadskyi, to resolve land disputes and develop a land reform project.\n\nA stable currency and tax system were established, the state budget was developed and executed, State and Land Banks were created. Private land ownership, including the one for the large landowners, was restored, the peasants' ownership of land was confirmed with the allocation and sale of communal lands, which contributed to the formation of a broad class of medium-sized landowners. However, the state grain monopoly imposed by the Germans and Austrians remained. The Skoropadskyi’s government relied on the restoration of large landlords and middle peasant farms, in which the German-Austrian occupation authorities were also interested. Supporting the Hetman, the landlords declared that small peasant farms were not able to provide large-scale commercial production of agricultural products, as demanded by war-ravaged Germany and Austria-Hungary from Ukraine. The soon-established supplies of industrial goods and agricultural implements to Ukraine from these countries helped ease the tense political and socio-economic situation in Ukrainian society.\n\nBy 1936, Ukraine had become one of the most promising economies in Europe, receiving a lot of money and investments from European powers. Industrial enterprises were restored and new ones were gradually created. There's no fear the Europe will ever stop buying our bread, though certain radical groups both in Ukraine and in emigration are calling for the Brotfrieden to be finally torn apart."
ukrpol.4.a: "We have become truly a breadbasket of Europe."

ukrpol.5.t: "The King Opens The Session Of The Soim"
ukrpol.5.d: "The Christmas festivities are over, and today was the first meeting of the Soim after the New Year’s break. The session was opened in person by King Vasyl, who addressed parliament and announced the need for a new budget for the year. His speech was met with skepticism by the majority consisting of members of the ruling Hetman’s Party, the SHD. However, the King’s supporters, the USKhD, cheerfully applauded the King’s speech, hastening to assure that Ukraine will be even richer and more successful this year."
ukrpol.5.a: "As useless as it could be."

ukrpol.6.t: "Donbas General Strike"
ukrpol.6.d: "Workers and miners in the east of the country staged another strike today over wage cuts and dissatisfaction with the huge number of working hours. They demand indulgences and refuse to work until their demands are met. Despite the fact that strikes are officially banned, Derzhavna Varta does not yet dare to disperse the workers, awaiting instructions from the central government."
ukrpol.6.a: "Make minor concessions to them."
ukrpol.6.b: "Suppress the strikers!"
ukrpol.6.c: "Ignore them, we have more serious problems."

ukrpol.7.t: "Derzhavna Varta Reports to the Hetman"
ukrpol.7.d: "Derzhavna Varta presented its annual report for the past year to Hetman Skoropadskyi personally, noting its merits in the fight against sabotage and terrorism on the territory of the Kingdom. The situation was especially tense in Odesa, where, according to the head of the State Guard, organized crime and banditry were rampant. Funded, according to Getman, by both French syndicalists and Romanian legionnaires, the troubled region has been at the center of various scandals for years. Measures must be taken to eliminate crime as quickly as possible."
ukrpol.7.a: "We must strengthen our anti-terrorist measures"

ukrpol.8.t: "Prosvita Spreads Anti-Monarchist Appeals"
ukrpol.8.d: "The Prosvita, which originally appeared as the Ukrainian Enlightenment Society, from the years of the civil war fell into the hands of the socialists and syndicalists of the Dyrektoria and conducts its subversive activities on the territory of the Kingdom, mainly spreading anti-monarchist slogans. Until recently, their activities had little impact, but with the onset of the crisis, more and more people prefer to believe in any criticism of the regime, seeing in it the culprit of all their misfortunes."
ukrpol.8.a: "Prosvita shall not pass!"

ukrpol.9.t: "Kyiv German Garrison Recalled"
ukrpol.9.d: "The German command in Kyiv, known as the German Garrison, was withdrawn to Berlin as a result of Black Monday. For the first time since 1918 German troops, though no longer as numerous, left the country entirely.\n\nThere is already speculation as to what the political consequences of this decision will be, but in the absence of German control over Ukraine, anything can happen. In any case, the political forces have already begun to consolidate and prepare for anything."
ukrpol.9.a: "It’s time to act."

ukrpol.10.t: "Dualism"
ukrpol.10.d: "The Ukrainian political system, according to many, is imperfect. On the one hand, the Hetman is quite an influential figure with many powers, but on the other hand his ambitions are limited by Soim and the presence of the King. The Hetman has long dreamed of returning to the days when his power over Ukraine was virtually unlimited, and his place was not occupied by an Austrian impostor.\n\nOn the other hand, the King and Soim’s opposition parties are dissatisfied with the Hetman’s power and believe that his presence interferes with the normal functioning of parliament. In any case, it has often come to a conflict, and now is the best moment to settle the matter once and for all."
ukrpol.10.a: "Stand by the King"
ukrpol.10.b: "Stand by the Hetman"

### King's path to power ###
ukrpol.11.t: "In Search of Reliable Allies"
ukrpol.11.d: "In Ukraine, which has been almost completely cleansed of any political opposition, the Hetman regime is left with few rivals, and thus few potential allies.\n\nOn the one hand, our main ally in the parliament is Lypynskyi, the main ideologist of Ukrainian conservatism, who came into conflict with  the Hetman back in the mid-20’s and opposed his autocratic rule. Now he is not only the leader of the Soim opposition, but also the main critic of the regime and supporter of the king. An alliance with his party, the USKhD, is probably the most favorable prospect for us.\n\nOn the other hand, there are also elements dissatisfied with the Hetman among the Ukrainian armed forces. In particular, this is the Ukrainian Military Organization under the leadership of Konovalets. At first disarmed by the Hetman, the Sichi Striltsi detachments were soon restored and had a significant influence on the formation of the armed forces. However, Konovalets himself, who holds more nationalistic views, hardly supports the Hetman."
ukrpol.11.a: "Lypynskyi is reliable enough" #will lead to UVO joining the Dyrektoria and death of Konovalets
ukrpol.11.b: "What can we do without Sich Striltsi?" #UVO will attempt countercoup

ukrpol.12.t: "The Royal Conspiracy"
ukrpol.12.d: "King Vasyl had long thought that the Hetman was only in the way. The political system in which he finds himself is completely devoid of any transparency or honesty, and Hetman does everything to ensure that neither the Parliament nor the King has any influence on important political decisions. This must come to an end. A conspiracy against Hetman is brewing. This man must not remain in power, otherwise Ukraine will be in distress. It is necessary to look for allies to solve the problem of imperfect Ukrainian politics."
ukrpol.12.a: "The Hetman should go or be forced to go!"

ukrpol.13.t: "UVO Activities in Galicia"
ukrpol.13.d.king: "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local militarized units of Ukrainian Striltsi. Now that we have joined together in a conspiracy against the Hetman with Konovalets, he insists that Melnyk should return to Ukraine and help us in the rebellion."
ukrpol.13.d.hetman: "After the Ukrainian Military Organization was established, one of Konovalets' main associates, Andriy Melnyk, was sent to Galicia, where he headed the local militarized units of Ukrainian Striltsi. Now that Konovalets is cooperating with Soim and King, he insists that Melnyk should return to Ukraine, which makes us feel uncomfortable about true UVO's intentions."
ukrpol.13.a: "[ukrpol_13_a]"
ukrpol.13.king: "Melnyk would be useful in the upcoming events..."
ukrpol.13.hetman: "Wasn't he feeling good in Galicia?"

ukrpol.14.t: "Ukraine Seizes Polish Farms"
ukrpol.14.d: "We received information that the Ukrainian government has allowed requisition of Polish farms in West and Central Ukraine. Lobbied by the Ukraininan nationalists, they hopefully wanted to end the centuries-long Polish noblemen’s landholdings. However, they have just left our Polish brethren without any concessions. We should officially send a note of protest to the Ukrainian King!"
ukrpol.14.a: "How dare they?"

ukrpol.15.t: "Note of Protest From [FROM.GetName]"
ukrpol.15.d: "Upon learning of the requisitioning of Polish farms, the Polish government sent us a strong note of protest and expelled a couple of diplomats from their country. They demand that the nationalized property of citizens of Polish nationality be immediately returned to them or compensated. Perhaps we really overreacted and we should not spoil relations with the Poles, given that by doing so we might give them carte blanche to carry out similar repressions against Ukrainians on their territory."
ukrpol.15.a: "We should not risk our [FROM.GetAdjective] ally." #We can peacefully negotiate on Galicia later
ukrpol.15.b: "The domination of Shliakhta will end eventually." #Ukrainian-Polish relations will be destroyed

ukrpol.16.t: "Secret Rearmament in Bila Tserkva"
ukrpol.16.d: "In Bila Tserkva, the main stronghold of the Sichovi Striltsi and the location of the UVO headquarters, weapons were secretly delivered from the warehouses under Konovalets’s supervision to fully equip the detachments and prepare them for the capture of Kyiv and the liberation of the country from the Hetman. It is planned to raid the governor-general’s palace, the official residence of the Hetman and arrest him. In doing so, however, we may come face to face with Derzhavna Varta, who serves, among other things, as the Hetman’s personal guard. By accomplishing the coup quickly and with less blood, we will save the country from a full-fledged civil war."
ukrpol.16.a: "The Corps is ready to storm Kyiv"

ukrpol.17.t: "Peasant Discontent Is Growing"
ukrpol.17.d: "In the provinces, peasant discontent with rising food prices is growing. Unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about it, as long as our economy is unstable and the Hryvnia has not stabilized enough. Given the current situation, we need to take some measures to reassure disgruntled farmers."
ukrpol.17.king: "Tighten your belts!"
ukrpol.17.hetman: "Introduce benefits!"

ukrpol.18.t: "Advisor to the King"
ukrpol.18.d: "With the conclusion of the alliance between the King and Lypynskyi, he was granted the right to become an official royal advisor. This way, according to Vasyl, Lypynskyi would be safe, because the Hetman would not dare to encroach on the royal advisor without causing an international scandal involving Austria and Germany. Now Hetman’s hands are virtually tied, and even if he banned Lypynskyi’s party, we can be sure of his personal safety.\n\nMoreover, the position of royal advisor, despite its formality, also gives Lypynskyi the right to officially represent the king."
ukrpol.18.king: "Notify the Hetman of the new position at the Royal court"
ukrpol.18.hetman: "Seems like Lypynskyi received security guarantees."

ukrpol.19.t: "Sich Striltsi Disarmed and Disbanded!"
ukrpol.19.d: "Today it became known that on Hetman’s order all units of the elite units of the Sichovi Striltsi were disarmed and disbanded. Their commander, Yevhen Konovalets, was also demoted. According to Hetman, these units were characterized by virtually uncontrolled activities that were harmful to Ukraine and made it vulnerable to external and internal threats."
ukrpol.19.king: "Who does this Hetman think he is?"
ukrpol.19.hetman: "Another source of instability is destroyed."

ukrpol.20.t: "Yevhen Konovalets Shot Dead!"
ukrpol.20.d: "Today it became known about the unfortunate death of Colonel Yevhen Konovalets, the former leader of the Sichovi Striltsi and the Ukrainian Military Organization. \n\nThis morning in Kyiv, while Konovalets was walking through the city, he was suddenly approached by an unknown assailant who shot the colonel three times. One of the bullets pierced his lung and the other hit his heart, causing Konovalets to die on the spot, bleeding to death. The unknown assailant managed to escape and his whereabouts are still unknown. Derzhavna Varta officially ordered an investigation into the premeditated murder and promised to do everything possible to find the culprit.\n\nThe king spoke on the radio, deploring the death of one of the best sons of the fatherland, a defender of Ukraine and a hero. Hetman also spoke, promising to punish the perpetrators by all means, and stating that it was largely thanks to the colonel that Ukraine was able to defend itself."
ukrpol.20.king: "A great loss for Ukraine"
ukrpol.20.hetman: "We do not forgive traitors"

ukrpol.21.t: "A Royal Visit to Vienna"
ukrpol.21.d: "Today it became known about the planned visit of King Vasyl to Vienna. He will attend a reception at the royal palace, where he will meet with Emperor Charles, and then attend unofficial events. As a member of the Habsburg royal family, Vasyl is always welcomed in Vienna."
ukrpol.21.a: "Let us hope they agree"

ukrpol.22.t: "King Vasyl Arrives to Vienna"
ukrpol.22.d: "Today King Vasyl of Ukraine visited Vienna, specifically a reception at the royal palace, where he met with Emperor Charles. Later on, however, the King made a strange request to support him with arms or finances and warned of an assassination attempt being prepared against him. He said that the era of the Hetman was coming to an end and that Ukraine must move into a new phase of nation-building. Whatever that means, we need to support Habsburg!"
ukrpol.22.a: "Provide all the help needed."
ukrpol.22.b: "We cannot spare anything." 

ukrpol.23.t: "Austria Agrees to Help"
ukrpol.23.d: "The emperor of Austria received the king and promised to provide all necessary assistance."
ukrpol.23.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.24.t: "Austria Refused to Intervene"
ukrpol.24.d: "The Austrian Empire refused to help us, due to the lack of available resources."
ukrpol.24.a: "Unfortunately."

ukrpol.25.t: "Lypky Assault"
ukrpol.25.d.uvo: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Skoropadskyi is located. \n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, around noon, units of Sichovi Striltsi under the command of Yevhen Konovalets arrived in the city. Their purpose was to arrest the Hetman, dissolve the Derzhavna Varta and proclaim the power of Soim and the King. Soon there was a gunfight heard between the Derzhavna Varta and the Striltsi, which also acted as a guard for the Hetman, with little loss on either side. The Hetman appealed to the Army to protect the city from the rebellion of the Striltsi, but the officers refused to carry out the order. Soon the Hetman was forced to surrender. He formally abdicated his position of Hetman, being arrested after that.\n\nIn the headlines, the events took place as the Lypky Assault. Shortly after the arrest of the Hetman, an emergency meeting was convened in Soim, at which the King spoke, announcing the end of the era of repression. He also announced that in view of Skoropadskyi’s inability to fulfill his duties as Hetman, he himself became acting Hetman until the leader of one of the parliamentary factions is appointed to the position.\n\nIn Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."
ukrpol.25.d: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Skoropadskyi is located. \n\nAccording to eyewitness accounts, protests and riots against the hetman began in the city around 10 a.m., initiated by the USKhD. Their aim was to arrest the hetman, dissolve the Derzhavna Varta and proclaim the power of the Soim and the King. The Army was introduced into the city, but it took the side of the rebels. Soon there was a gunfight between the Derzhavna Varta, which also served as the Hetman’s guard, and the Army, with small casualties on both sides. Soon the Hetman was forced to surrender. He formally abdicated his position of Hetman, being arrested after that.\n\nIn the headlines, the events took place as the Lypky Assault. Shortly after the arrest of the Hetman, an emergency meeting was convened in Soim, at which the King spoke, announcing the end of the era of repression.

ukrpol.25.a: "The End of the Hetmanate!"

ukrpol.26.t: "Consolidating the Hetman’s Power"
ukrpol.26.d: "Ukraine needs reform; the dual power situation can no longer continue. Even though opposition parties are in the minority, Hetman's power needs to be strengthened. On the one hand, we can trust Mykola Mikhnovskyi, previously exiled to Kuban, but the only person who can support Skoropadskyi from the 'Independentist camp'.\nSoim, on the other hand, only brings instability to our current situation, for which Hetman could issue emergency powers and dissolve parliament."
ukrpol.26.a: "We should trust Mikhnovskyi." #will lead to UVO joining Dyrektoria as soon as it revolts
ukrpol.26.b: "It is time to dissolve the Soim." #will lead to death of Konovalets

ukrpol.27.t: "Appointment of the New Governors"
ukrpol.27.d: "As part of the expansion of the coalition with the Mikhnovites, Hetman passed a resolution appointing new governors: in particular, appointing Fedir Sumnevych as provincial commissar of Volyn and Podillia. Volodymyr Strashkevych, a literary scholar and linguist, was appointed governor of Vinnytsia at Mikhnovskyi's suggestion."
ukrpol.27.king: "Mikhnovskyi entrenches his influence..."
ukrpol.27.hetman: "Hope we can count on them"

ukrpol.28.t: "Ukrainian Conservatism Discredited"
ukrpol.28.d: "Today in a major government newspaper, surprised Kyivans could read an interesting article that Ukrainian conservatism, as articulated by Viacheslav Lypynskyi, is bad for Ukraine. Many were puzzled, how could a government newspaper condemn the official ideology of the leading party, but soon everything fell into place. It turned out that the only correct Ukrainian conservatism can be only with a Hetman at the head, and of Ukrainian origin, which is only Pavlo Skoropadskyi. And the monarchist Lypynskyi, leader of the opposition, promotes Germanic rule over Ukraine, supporting the claims of a German-imposed king."
ukrpol.28.hetman: "Who even supports the Austrian Impostor?"
ukrpol.28.king: "Hetman discredited the 'Hetman movemement', ridiculous."

ukrpol.29.t: "Soim Dissolved. Martial Law Enacted."
ukrpol.29.d: "According to Article 16 of the Laws on the State Structure of Ukraine, the Hetman has the right to dissolve the Soim and establish a state of emergency at any time. This article, which significantly restricts parliament, allows the Hetman to occupy the dominant position in the state structure of Ukraine, but so far this article has never been used, due to the strong position of the pro-Hetman SHD party and the weakness of the anti-Hetman opposition in parliament.\n\nUsing his emergency powers, Skoropadskyi announced the premature dissolution of the Sejm and the assumption of full authority under the state of emergency caused by the economic crisis and the unbridled terrorist activities unleashed by the Dyrektoria. \n\nThanks to this, the Hetman will have the right to pass any emergency laws, including those that will help him to establish his absolute power."
ukrpol.29.hetman: "Our State needs stability, not empty chatter!"
ukrpol.29.king: "Another loophole in our Constitution!"

ukrpol.30.t: "Hetman’s Emergency Powers"
ukrpol.30.d: "Under the state of emergency, Hetman Skoropadskyi issued a decree to assume emergency powers and intensify anti-terrorist measures until Ukraine returned to the path of stability and the Dyrektoria was destroyed.\n\nAs part of his extraordinary powers, apparently used to reduce the influence of Parliament and the King, literally the first decree of Pan Hetman was the right of the Hetman to appoint a government, a right previously taken away from him by a change in the laws. Although the Hetman only confirmed the Otaman of Ministers and the ministers themselves proposed by Soim, such a measure would enable him not merely to reject all the proposals of the opposition parliament, but simply to ignore them."
ukrpol.30.hetman: "Just a suspension of externally imposed laws"
ukrpol.30.king: "Skoropadskyi only makes himself new enemies"

ukrpol.31.t: "Conspiracy Rumors"
ukrpol.31.d: "Rumors circulating in the press and in small circles about a plot in the armed forces and parliament to overthrow Hetman have flooded the backstage of the government. \n\nAccording to the latest information, a group of high-ranking generals is planning to establish a new power by armed force and arrest Hetman, the main beneficiaries being, of course, the King and the opposition parliament.\n\nThis state of affairs is unacceptable, and the Hetman has therefore issued a decree granting the Power Varta the power to conduct searches and wiretaps without the need for a judicial warrant, for the security of the country and the state."
ukrpol.31.a: "Derzhavna Varta should not feel itself constrained."

ukrpol.32.t: "Explosion on the Dnieper"
ukrpol.32.d: "The nation of Ukraine is in mourning today as news has just reached us that His Royal Majesty, King Vasyl of All-Ukraine, has been brutally assassinated during an excursion on his yacht in the Dnieper River. The King, nicknamed 'The Red Prince', beloved for his dedication to the welfare of his people, was enjoying a rare moment of respite in the company of close friends when a sudden explosion, loud enough to be heard on the shores of the river, tore through the yacht.\n\nThe vessel was quickly engulfed in flames, and eyewitnesses report seeing a chaotic scramble of emergency aid boats and floundering survivors. It is now confirmed that among those who perished were the King himself, with several of his entourage and naval staff also dead and missing. Early investigations point to a powerful explosive device, likely planted by a highly-skilled assassin with intimate knowledge of the King's schedule and the layout of the yacht.\n\nAs Ukraine reels in shock, the question of who could have wanted Vasyl dead looms large. Was it the work of one of our nation's numerous enemies, seeking to destabilize us in a time of great strife? Or could it be the result of internal machinations, ambitious politicians or military officers craving power? What is certain is that Ukraine now faces an uncertain future, as the line of succession for the Ukrainian throne is brought into question and a struggle for power seems inevitable."
ukrpol.32.a: "A tragedy for the entire nation!"

ukrpol.33.t: "The Regency Council"
ukrpol.33.d: "In the wake of the sudden death of the heirless King Vasyl of Habsburg-Lorraine, the Hetman announced the convening of the Council of Regents, headed by himself, with the goal of taking measures to determine the rightful heir to the Ukrainian throne.\n\nSo far the main candidates for the throne are uncertain and the Board of Regents is in the initial stages of its actions, but many are already predicting that the decision of the Board of Regents will change Ukraine beyond recognition..."

ukrpol.34.d: "After the successful coup, the Sichovi Striltsi, led by UVO leader Yevhen Konovalets, returned to their base in Bila Tserkva. However, rumors soon reached the capital that the elite units were hurriedly preparing for a new offensive. Fearing a counter-coup, the King ordered roadblocks to be set up on all roads leading out of Kyiv, but this can hardly help us..."
ukrpol.34.a: "Something is in the air..."

ukrpol.35.t: "Storming of the Royal Palace"
ukrpol.35.d: "Today the Sichovi Striltsi marched out of Bila Tserkva in full combat readiness, and recruited an additional volunteer legion. It was not difficult for them to bypass the roadblocks, where they met little or no resistance, and enter Kyiv. Soon there was an assault on the royal palace near the Soim, but the defenders soon laid down their arms in view of the superiority of the enemy. The police also refused to participate in what was going on, which left the King alone with a crowd of armed men.\n\nVasyl hastily signed the abdication, appointing Konovalets as regent. At the same time, the Striltsi arrested the Soim in its entirety and announced its temporary dissolution until the next elections. Vasyl was given the chance to leave the country, which he did, traveling to Lviv.\n\nOn the same evening, newspapers published Konovalets' appeal to the inhabitants of Ukraine that the Kingdom had fallen and a new, national republic would now replace the past corrupt government. The population as a whole supported the nationalist coup, hoping for a change for the better in the economic life of the country and long-awaited sovereignty from outside forces."
ukrpol.35.a: "Is this the birth of new Ukraine?"

ukrpol.301.t: "Mykola Mikhnovskyi Returns From Kuban"
ukrpol.301.d: "Mikhnovskyi came to Kyiv today. The hardened nationalist and author of the first draft of the Ukrainian Constitution got off the train after returning from \"exile\". No one, of course, officially stylized Mikhnovskyi's stay in the Kuban as exile, but everyone was well aware of it. And now, a decade later, Mikhnovskyi himself appeared in Kyiv - the new Minister of Foreign Affairs at the behest of the Hetman himself.\n\nOf course, for many people it was rather a symbol of the decline of the Hetmanate. Having hesitated to appoint Mikhnovskyi as Otaman of the Council of Ministers in 1918, Hetman offered him the place of his \"Personal Advisor (Bunchuznyi Tovarish)\", which deeply hurt the feelings of the ambitious politician, who soon afterwards went into opposition, but could not support the Socialists of the Dyrektoria either, whom he hated.\n\nWith the appointment of Mikhnovskyi as Minister of Foreign Affairs, one should not expect much. And despite the fact that Hetman now has at least some ally, let's see what this partnership will bring in the future."
ukrpol.301.king: "That lunatic? Pathetic..."
ukrpol.301.hetman: "We welcome Mikhnovskyi in Kyiv!"

### First Dyrektoria uprising (ukrpol.36-100)

ukrpol.36.t: "Fall of Rivne"
ukrpol.36.d: "Tonight, detachments of thousands of troops of the so-called \"Army of the UNR\" under the leadership of Symon Petliura crossed the border of Galicia and Ukraine. On their way they hastily seized Lutske, which surrendered without a fight, and headed toward Rivne. \n\nIn Rivne by that time they already knew about the approaching troops and declared a state of emergency. However, to the surprise of many, the Dyrektoria’s propaganda worked to their advantage, and the townspeople and many of the gendarmes not only abandoned the confrontation, but also took the side of the Republic. Small battles broke out in the city, but our troops were forced to retreat and take up defensive positions near Zhytomyr and Vinnytsia. \n\nMeanwhile, the head of the Dyrektoria, Volodymyr Vynnychenko, arrived in Rivne, immediately announcing the restoration of the Ukrainian People’s Republic and the liberation march on Kyiv."

ukrpol.37.t: "Uprising Crushed!"
ukrpol.37.d: "Tonight, detachments of thousands of troops of the so-called \"Army of the UNR\" under the leadership of Symon Petliura crossed the border of Galicia and Ukraine. On their way they hastily seized Lutske, which surrendered without a fight, and headed toward Rivne. \n\nIn Rivne by that time they already knew about the approaching troops and declared a state of emergency. The city was ready for a siege and was well armed. The UNR Army was unable to take it and was driven back to Lutske, where our troops counterattacked to dislodge them from the city. Seeing the enormous superiority of our troops, the UNR army rushed to flee with Petliura until control of the border with Galicia was fully restored.\n\nThe Dyrektoria’s "liberation" campaign clearly failed and they were forced to lay low in Galicia."
ukrpol.37.a: "The Ukrainian borders are safe!"

ukrpol.38.d: "After the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] had more or less gained power, a telegram reached our leadership from Galicia that the so-called Dyrektoria was ready to recognize our government on the condition that fair elections were held. Although the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] is convinced that the socialists have no place in the new Ukraine, we could have accepted their offer, because in that case a sufficient number of experienced generals of the UNR, including Petliura, would have joined our troops. As for the elections, the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] insists on maintaining the \"temporary\" dictatorship of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] until better times come, without, however, openly stating when those times will come.\n\nOn the other hand, the recognition of the Dyrektoria may undermine our credibility and sooner or later their socialist leaders may direct the people’s discontent not at our enemies, but at ourselves."
ukrpol.38.a: "Some of them may join us."
ukrpol.38.b: "We are not welcoming any socialists here."

ukrpol.39.t: "The Ukrainian Galician Army Leaves for Ukraine"
ukrpol.39.d: "The officers, serving in the Ukrainian Galician Army, formed in the early 1920s, have left our country in order to join the uprising of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in Rivne.\n\nThey have left the Galicia-Lodomeria today in the morning and are expected to arrive in Rivne tomorrow.\nThe UGA, led by an experienced officer, Hnat Stefaniv, was an important volunteer force in our state, and the only possible garrison in the Ukrainian-majority territory."
ukrpol.39.a: "Off they go!"

ukrpol.40.t: "Officers From Ukrainian Galician Army Join"
ukrpol.40.d: "The officers, serving in the Ukrainian Galician Army, formed in the early 1920s, have joined our Command.\n\nThey have left the Galicia-Lodomeria yesterday morning and have now arrived in Rivne, where the headquarters of the Ukrainian People’s Republic is located.\nThe UGA, led by an experienced officer, Hnat Stefaniv, has taken an oath of loyalty and allegiance to the People’s Republic."
ukrpol.40.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.41.t: "UPSS Defects to Dyrektoria!"
ukrpol.41.d.hetman: "With the demise of the king, the last hope of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Independentists for a legal struggle against the Hetman and the restoration of democracy faded into oblivion. After Hetman's flirting with Russophiles, sluggish Ukrainianization and building of aristocratic-authoritarian regime, it seems that the last patriots of Hetmanshchyna have not endured. Today it has become known that the Central Committee of the UPSS has declared its support for the Dyrektoria, and through General Hrekiv's \"Batkivschyna\" community a mass transfer of soldiers and whole regiments to the positions of our opponents in Volyn has begun."
ukrpol.41.d.king: "Despite initial support for Vasyl, the last hope of the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Independentists for restoration of democracy faded into oblivion. After King has rejected the UPSS's plan to change the system, it seems that the last patriots of Hetmanshchyna have not endured. Today it has become known that the Central Committee of the UPSS has declared its support for the Dyrektoria, and through General Hrekiv's \"Batkivschyna\" community a mass transfer of soldiers and whole regiments to the positions of our opponents in Volyn has begun."
ukrpol.41.a: "We always knew they were traitors!"

ukrpol.42.t: "Ukrainian Ambassador Questions Crimea Status"
ukrpol.42.d: "With the uprising of the leftists in Ukraine finally suppressed, we are now obliged to return what is rightfull Ukrainian - their fleet and their peninsula of Crimea, that we occupied in order to secure our influence."
ukrpol.42.a: "Return them Crimea and the fleet."

ukrpol.43.t: "Germany Returns Crimea!"
ukrpol.43.d: "The German Ambassador in Kyiv has just informed the government and the [GetUKRTitle] that the temporary occupation of our Crimean peninsula and the Black Fleet is over, effectively returning it back to us."
ukrpol.43.a: "Our friends in Berlin are our true friends."

ukrpol.44.t: "Rebels Cut Off [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]" # Brest
ukrpol.44.d: "The city of [792.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] became the first city to fall in rebel hands. There was little resistance, as most of the garrison had mutinied or even joined the Dyrektoria's peasant militias. The city's Jewish-Polish majority welcomed the republican forces with cheers. With the stronghold established, the main railway from [202.GetName] to [93.GetName] was cut. Not wasting any time, the People's Army started to advance to every direction.\n\nThe most critical situation is in [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], as the city cannot be reinforced, and the countryside around it is quickly declaring its allegiance to the republican government. The commander is requesting permission to ask help from the Polish army right across the border, arguing that it is the only way to hold the city. It is true that the rebels would most likely avoid attacking foreign soldiers, in fear that it would give the Polish Army justification to support the [GetUKRTitle]. However, relying on foreign forces would be also a sign of weakness for the [GetUKRTitle]. The alternative option is to forbid them from such desperate pleads, and vaguely promise support as long as they hold the city."

ukrpol.45.d: "The clash between Ukrainian republican rebels and the garrison at [93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] could have easily ended in a catastrophe for the Hetmanate's forces. However their request for support was answered by Poland's 5th Infantry Division stationed at [1088.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Based on the military alliance between the two countries, Polish forces entered the city and bolstered its defences to the point that rebels didn't dare to continue their assault, and instead retreated to rural [997.GetName], continuing to wage the partisan war from there."

ukrpol.46.d: "[93.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]'s orders were clear - to resist the rebels to the last bullet. It didn't take much to break the commander's spirit, though. Some of the garrison mutinied, saying that they would not shoot their countrymen. Combined with heavy public pressure from the population, he decided to order surrender, and lay down the weapons, as relief from [202.GetName] was obviously not arriving any time soon."
ukrpol.46.a: "Sad!"

ukrpol.47.t: "Hetman Skoropadskyi Arrives to Berlin"
ukrpol.47.d: "The latest news from Kyiv came to Berlin together with the deposed Hetman Skoropadskyi and his family - as a result of an armed coup apparently initiated by the King and supported by Austria, the Hetman was dismissed from his position. The overthrown government was replaced by a provisional government led by the second largest party, the USKhD, which, although virtually identical to the Hetman's party, supports a constitutional monarchy headed by King Vasyl, whom they plan to crown as Hetman.\n\nThe broken status-quo in Ukraine could lead to serious destabilization throughout Eastern Europe, as we are also receiving intelligence from secret intelligence about a socialist uprising being prepared in the lands bordering Austria. In addition, there have been recent strikes by workers in virtually every major city in Ukraine, leading to widespread production problems.\n\nMoreover, even if the uprising is crushed, it is highly likely that the new Ukrainian government will side with Austria, as the balance of power has obviously shifted in favor of the Habsburgs."
ukrpol.47.a: "Condemn this unneccessary provocation!"
ukrpol.47.b: "Better not worsen the situation - Ukraine is still our ally."

ukrpol.48.t: "[FROM.GetName] Condemns the Coup!"
ukrpol.48.d: "Today, the official German ambassador to Kyiv handed over a note of protest to our Minister of Foreign Affairs. Germany strictly and seriously condemns the recent armed coup against Hetman, which it considers in this very vein. Nevertheless, for the time being, we remain part of the German sphere of influence and have no plans to leave it, although a condemnation by the Germans would clearly strike a blow to sentiments both within society and within the government."
ukrpol.48.a: "We stay loyal to Germany, at least for now..."

ukrpol.54.t: "Talks with Crimean Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.54.d: "The recent clashes in Crimea have shown that there is also an anti-Hetmanist movement there. We have contacted the so-called Crimean Dyrektoria and its leader, Solomon Krym. He has recently returned from exile to lead a separatist anti-Hetmanist movement. However, his final goal is to make Crimean Tatars independent, which is not what our plans are."
ukrpol.54.a: "We should have an ally in the south."
ukrpol.54.b: "What?! Crimea is Ukraine!"

ukrpol.55.t: "Unrest in the South-East"
ukrpol.55.d: "Another hotbed of armed rebellion, though expected, was the Donbas and Kharkiv region. The workers of the country's largest industrial enterprises expectedly sided with the uprising. The strikes that have been going on lately have turned into street riots in almost all major cities - Yuzivka, Kharkiv, Mariupil, and even Oleksandrivske.\n\nThe largest and most destructive uprising took place in Kharkiv - the leaders of the local Borotbyst underground cell carried out an armed takeover of the city administration and hung out a red flag as early as last week. And already today it became known about the fall of the railway junction, the post office and the seizure of hostages from among the last of the Starostas loyal to Kyiv. In addition, a number of our officers sided with the Borotbysts, announcing the creation of the 'Chervona Hvardiia Kharkova'. A similar situation occurred in Yuzivka, where our largest transport and industrial hub is located.\n\nBut the province is also restless - the peasants and farmers of Starobilshchyna and Luhanshchyna have declared their support for the peasant revolts against our troops. Bakhmut, the largest center of Ukrainian culture in the southeast, also sided with the Dyrektoria. The most difficult situation was in the rural areas of Donbas, where the banner of rebellion was raised by anarchists apparently inspired by Makhnivschyna."
ukrpol.55.a: "Accursed reds."

ukrpol.56.t: "Odesa in Flames!"
ukrpol.56.d: "Odesa, Ukraine's second largest city, had been paralyzed for weeks by strikes by port workers. The strikers had erected barricades on the central roads, and a militia organized by the Borotbysts had essentially fortified the port of Odesa and was engaged in tense negotiations with city officials loyal to Kyiv. After news of the open revolt in Rivne, all hell broke loose in Odesa - a mutiny broke out on the destroyer 'Petro Mohyla', which immediately opened fire on army roadblocks around the harbor. In just a few hours the Borotbysts seized control of most of the city's infrastructure, and the local leader of the uprising was proclaimed the Odesa Workers' Commune.\n\nA similar situation developed in neighboring Mykolaiv, where, inspired by the success of Odesa, the workers of the Mykolaiv Shipyard, supported by a number of soldiers who had defected to their side, began an uprising that quickly spilled over into spontaneous riots in the port city. \n\nFinally, the third major city in the south, Kherson, was untouched by itself, but all the surrounding villages declared allegiance to the Directorate and began peasant revolts.\n\nIt is safe to say that the entire southwest of Ukraine fell and came under the control of the rebels."
ukrpol.56.a: "Damn!"

ukrpol.61.t: "Decisive Blow to the Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.61.d: "Loyal troops were able to successfully break through the defenses built by the rebels in Rivne and seized most of Volhynia. The peasant uprising in the South was successfully suppressed, and finally the entire territory of Ukraine was back under our control.\n\nThe cowardly Republicans were able to hide in Galicia, but we have no doubt that they will no longer venture into our territory with their anti-state slogans, and sooner or later we will be able to negotiate with the Austrians so that they will give us these traitors and criminals."
ukrpol.61.a: "Victory!"

ukrpol.63.t: "Fall of Kyiv"
ukrpol.63.d: "After prolonged resistance and siege, key troops were withdrawn from Kyiv and the city was surrendered to the enemy. Our ruler was forced to leave power and the capital and go abroad, losing control of most of the country. However, this was not the end. Although power no longer extended to the Southeast and South, where the formation of people's councils and self-government of workers and peasants had effectively begun, and, in some cases, treacherous defections to the enemy, there were still remnants of loyalists in the country who did not want to surrender."
ukrpol.63.a: "Hetman is forced to abdicate!"
ukrpol.63.b: "King flees to Austria!"
ukrpol.63.c: "Striltsi give up the city!"

ukrpol.64.t: "The Remnants of Derzavnyks"
ukrpol.64.t2: "The Remnants of Nationalists"
ukrpol.64.d: "The last troops, who had praised the King and the Hetman until long ago, finally surrendered. We have been able to establish complete control over our territories, and despite the widespread chaos, growing anarchy and banditry, we can confidently say that in the midst of all this mess there are no more people left who are willing to take up arms against our new, popular government, for the rule of landlords and hetmans. \n\nThe era of injustice and inequality is over, military parades are being held in the cities, and people are triumphing and plundering the rich lands of their neighbors. Ukraine is unstable, and it needs to return to unity for the sake of the common future of our citizens."
ukrpol.64.d2: "The last troops that had been on the side of the nationalist government finally surrendered.

Ukraine is unstable, and it needs to return to unity for the common future of our citizens."
ukrpol.64.a: "Victory!"

### Dyrektoria interactions

ukrpol.67.t: "Ukrainian Demands"
ukrpol.67.d: "The Ukrainian government has sent us an official note of protest for supporting the so-called Dyrektoria, the government of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in exile. According to them, we are harboring terrorists who are actively engaged in sabotage and anti-monarchist propaganda in Ukraine."
ukrpol.67.a: "What can we do?"
ukrpol.67.b: "Pressure the 'Dyrektoria'"

ukrpol.68.t: "Galicia Can Do Nothing"
ukrpol.68.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has told us that they can do nothing in order to stop this. They believe that it is our internal affairs and our problems, they just host the government-in-exile and they cannot arrest them."
ukrpol.68.a: "Damn."

ukrpol.69.t: "Galicia Pressures Dyrektoria"
ukrpol.69.d: "Our [FROM.GetAdjective] representatives have confirmed that they have threatened the Dyrektoria to cease any operations in [ROOT.GetNameDefCap] with stopping their support for their 'government-in-exile'."
ukrpol.69.a: "Great!"

ukrpol.70.t: "Anti-Monarchist Protests in Large Cities"
ukrpol.70.d: "Today, anti-government rallies were held in major cities, in spite of the direct prohibition of the Derzavna Varta and Hetman, under brightly colored anti-monarchist slogans. Crowds of townspeople, mostly workers and poor bourgeoisie, demanded bread and the abdication of the king, as well as a change of government, the legalization of strikes and opposition parties, in general - everything that the revolutionary-terrorists of the Dyrektoria had promised them. \n\nThe crowds of protesters at first felt completely unpunished until heavily armed punitive squads arrived in the cities, and army troops were even brought into some major cities. The crowds were dispersed, usually without casualties, and the instigators were arrested and awaiting trial."
ukrpol.70.a: "Disperse the crowd!"

ukrpol.71.t: "Borotbysts Distribute Leaflets"
ukrpol.71.d: "We have heard rumors that the only terrorist organization operating in Ukraine, calling itself the Borotbysts, which does not formally associate itself with the Dyrektoria, has begun to distribute leaflets calling for an all-Ukrainian strike to stop factories and other industry and the revolutionary demands of the people, among which are the resignation of the government and the abdication of the king.\n\nThis state of affairs is totally unsatisfactory, and in this connection the Hetman ordered the Derzhavna Varta to immediately begin intensified reconnaissance of the alleged source of these leaflets, and to find and arrest the management of the printers who agreed to print these anti-government leaflets."
ukrpol.71.a: "Find the typographies that helps them!"
ukrmisc.74.b: "Tell me more about the Borotbysts."

ukrpol.72.t: "Russophiles Announce Support for Skoropadskyi"
ukrpol.72.d: "The Russophiles, mainly situated in the State Army and in the ruling party of SHD, are rallying in the support of the Hetman Skoropadskyi. They see him as a true successor of the Imperial order and lobby reorientation towards Russia."
ukrpol.72.a: "Interesting."

ukrpol.73.t: "Unrest in Volhynia"
ukrpol.73.d: "Volhynia is considered one of the unstable provinces of our state, because of its proximity to the borders of Galicia, it is in Rivne that the sympathies of the Dyrektoria and the Republican movement are strongest. Despite our efforts to pacify Rivne, spontaneous rallies were held there today under the banners of the Dyrektoria and demanding the convening of an All-Ukrainian Constituent Assembly. The peaceful rallies soon turned into riots, and the police had to forcibly disperse the rampaging crowd of looters and protesters."
ukrpol.73.a: "We cannot lose Volhynia!"

ukrpol.74.t: "Kharkiv Strikes"
ukrpol.74.d: "In addition to the west of the country, the east is also restless. Workers in Kharkiv went on mass strike today, demanding a shorter workday and higher wages. Following Donbas, Kharkiv residents sabotaged the work of large factories in the east. Anti-monarchist and socialist slogans were again strong among the slogans that spread. The strike was suppressed, and additional security forces were brought into the region."
ukrpol.74.a: "Will they ever calm down?"

ukrpol.75.d: "Today a few hours ago. while the Ukrainian King Vasyl was relaxing on his yacht, an explosion ripped through the hull immediately killing him. After that tragedy Ukraine's minister of security received a telegram from a socialist group claiming responsibility for mining the King's yacht, stating that the action was a result of their exclusion from the democratic process. There was no chance to save Vasyl, and thus the country has been plunged into disorder.\n\nThe Hetman, now alone with an empty throne, has announced that soon the Heir to the throne would be chosen by the Regency Council, headed by him, and the succession issues shall all be resolved.\n\nBefore it happens, though, he has announced that he will stay as the Supreme Leader, with Martial Law still in effect."

ukrpol.76.d: "Today, shots were heard in the Kyiv district of Lypky, Ukraine, where the former palace of the governor-general and now the residence of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi is located.\n\nAccording to the eyewitnesses, around noon, there have been armed clashes between Skoropadskyi’s loyalists and the opposition, which eventually led to the defeat of the Hetman. He was forced to retire and abdicate his claims to the Hetmanate. The King has announced that the power in the country is to be transfered to the elected Ukrainian Soim. In Germany, the events were perceived ambiguously, dubbing the events as a coup d'état."

ukrpol.77.t: "Volhynia Secured!"
ukrpol.77.d: "We have managed to successfully secure control over the whole Volhynia region. Now, the Dyrektoria is divided on the matter on what to do next. We can take a break and get ready for the full-scale war or try to establish control over Kyiv in a short amount of time, due to the help of Striltsi in Bila Tserkva."
ukrpol.77.a: "We should get ready for attack."
ukrpol.77.b: "We should do it quickly and bloodless"

ukrpol.78.t: "Kyiv Falls!"
ukrpol.78.d: "Thanks to the Striltsi, we managed to quickly seize Kyiv and establish our control there. The monarchist forces tried to fight back, but fellow Ukrainians walked to the streets to show their support for the Dyrektoria government. The Hetmanists never managed to shoot at the crowd and they had to give up with [UPR.GetLeader] fleeing abroad."
ukrpol.78.a: "People on our side!"

ukrpol.79.t: "Our Attack Repulsed!"
ukrpol.79.d: "It seems we've lost the momentum and our regiments in Bila Tserkva were too weak, but surprisingly the Monarchists managed to protect the capital city from us. It seems we have no other choice but to engage in a merciless fight with Hetmanists."
ukrpol.79.a: "Unfortunately..."

ukrpol.81.t: "Uprising Crushed!"
ukrpol.81.d: "The operation was successful. Before Dyrektoria managed to secure their control over Volhynia, we managed to raise some loyalists in Berestia and Lutske, and with the help of Zhytomyr garrison we have surrounded the headquarters of the rebels. Some of them managed to escape, but demoralized rebel troops have all surrendered."
ukrpol.81.a: "Did they really want to defeat us?"

ukrpol.82.t: "Failure of the Operation"
ukrpol.82.d: "Unfortunately, the operation was a complete failure. We missed when Dyrektoria managed to secure their control over Volhynia, and by the time our agents arrived there, they have already been ready. Our Agents were surrounded and the attack failed. It seems that the full-scale war is even closer now."
ukrpol.82.a: "We should get ready"

ukrpol.83.t: "Martial Law Sparks Outrage"
ukrpol.83.d: "After the signing of the temporary abolition of Soim and some civil liberties, as well as the non-permanent martial law, the country became even more resentful of the government. The Socialists declared Skoropadskyi a tyrant seeking to usurp power and \"repeat 1918\" for the peasants and workers of the country, and their words did not go unheeded.\n\nThe Borotbysts declared indefinite strikes of workers, a measure already being carried out in a number of the country's largest industrial enterprises. But even organizations closer to Skoropadskyi turned out to be unhappy with this decision - the USKhD and UPSS declared no confidence in Skoropadskyi's government, even though they lacked the political power to rectify the situation..."
ukrpol.83.a: "A point of no return..."


ukrpol.89.t: "Confrontation Escalates!"
ukrpol.89.d: "It has been several weeks since we lost control of Volyn, and the revolutionaries have occupied Rivne and established organizations under their control in the region. All this time, new recruits and insurgents have been pouring into their territory from Galicia and even from Naddnipryanshchina. Finally, however, we can confidently state that we have established full control over the line of contact, and according to our intelligence, the last stronghold of resistance to the revolutionaries in Volhynia has been destroyed. All this clearly leads to an escalation of the confrontation, for the Dyrektoria was able to establish full control over its territory and now they are clearly preparing to strike at the capital."
ukrpol.89.a: "We shall crush the insurgency!"

ukrpol.90.t: "UPSS Demands a Role in the Government"
ukrpol.90.d: "In view of the success of the coup d'état, the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Independentists, which is in opposition to the USKhD, made ultimatums to the king to appoint a prime minister from among the UPSS. \n\nSince anarchy was brewing in the countryside and the Dyrektoria troops were preparing to march out of Galicia, the UPSS, together with the \"Batkivschyna\" military association, issued an ultimatum to the king to appoint a new government headed by the UPSS. In return, the UPSS promises to save the country from anarchy.\n\nThe king was clearly puzzled by this approach. On the one hand, the formation of a new government headed by the UPSS would put the USKhD and Lypynskyi, the king's longtime supporters, in stiff opposition. On the other hand, if refused, the King would have to fight the social-nationalist opposition, and it was likely that the UPSS would then join the Dyrektoria."
ukrpol.90.a: "Agree to their ultimatum!"
ukrpol.90.b: "The King should not accept any ultimatums."

### Hetmanate ###
ukrpol.100.t: "Unmasking the Traitors"
ukrpol.100.d: "In the wake of the failed Dyrektoria uprising, Hetman Skoropadskyi ordered the establishment of a special tribunal to investigate the events surrounding the rebellion and hold accountable those who plotted against the state. With the country in a delicate state, the people yearn for stability and security. The so-called 'Kyiv Trials' shall become a symbol of Hetman Skoropadskyi's commitment to maintaining order and protecting the nation from internal threats. The proceedings are carried out meticulously, following due process and the principles of justice, ensuring a fair trial for all accused.\n\nNumerous individuals are brought before the tribunal, including key leaders and participants in the Dyrektoria uprising. The accused face charges of treason, conspiracy against the state, and inciting rebellion. The evidence against them is carefully presented, ranging from intercepted communications and testimonies to physical evidence collected during the suppression of the uprising.\n\nAs the trials progress, tensions rise within the nation. Supporters of the accused claim political persecution and decry the trials as a means to suppress dissent. Meanwhile, others see the proceedings as an opportunity to expose the true extent of the rebellion and ensure the stability of the Hetmanate.\n\nThe outcome of the trials will significantly impact the nation's future. If found guilty, the defendants may face severe consequences, ranging from imprisonment to even execution, depending on the severity of their crimes. The trials serve as a stern warning to those who may contemplate challenging the authority of Hetman Skoropadskyi and seek to destabilize Ukraine further.\n\nThe Kyiv Trials act as a catharsis for the nation, allowing grievances to be addressed, traitors to be unmasked, and justice to prevail. The Ukrainian people anxiously await the verdicts, hoping that the trials will bring closure to this turbulent chapter and pave the way for a more stable and united future under the leadership of Hetman Skoropadskyi."
ukrpol.100.a: "Let us await the verdict."

ukrpol.101.t: "Responsibility of the Trade-Unions"
ukrpol.101.d: "As the Kyiv Trials unfold, a closer examination of the trade-unions' role in the events leading up to the rebellion comes to light. The trade-unions had been active during the turbulent times, organizing strikes and advocating for workers' rights amidst the nation's fragile state. Their actions have raised questions about their potential influence on the escalating tensions and their level of involvement in the uprising.\n\nTrade-unions have a long history in Ukraine, championing the interests of workers and fighting for improved labor conditions. However, during the period of political chaos, some trade-unions took advantage of the situation to advance their own agenda, often in alignment with political factions opposed to the Hetmanate. They organized strikes, protests, and demonstrations, which contributed to the unrest and created an atmosphere of dissent.\nAs the rebellion unfolded, evidence emerged indicating that certain trade-union leaders played a significant role in fomenting and supporting the uprising. Their involvement ranged from providing financial assistance to the rebels, coordinating logistics, and using their networks to mobilize workers in support of the Dyrektoria. Their actions cast doubt on their commitment to the stability and prosperity of the Hetmanate.\n\nAt the heart of the debate surrounding the trade-unions' responsibility is the question of whether their actions were driven by genuine grievances and a desire for social change or whether they were co-opted by political elements seeking to undermine the Hetmanate. Supporters argue that the trade-unions were responding to the deteriorating conditions faced by workers and were advocating for necessary reforms. They believe that the trade-unions should be absolved of any guilt, as their actions were a manifestation of the broader discontent within society.\n\nOn the other hand, critics argue that the trade-unions' activities went beyond legitimate labor advocacy, as they actively supported the rebellion against the Hetmanate. They contend that the trade-union leaders exploited the prevailing instability to advance their own ideological and political goals, jeopardizing the nation's security and impeding efforts to restore order.\n\nThe outcome of these proceedings will have far-reaching implications for the trade-union movement and its future place within the Hetmanate. It remains to be seen whether the trade-unions will be absolved of any wrongdoing or if their leaders will be held accountable for their actions, shaping the relationship between labor organizations, the government, and the broader population."
ukrpol.101.a: "There's no need to punish them."
ukrpol.101.b: "The trade-unions should be put under state control."

ukrpol.102.t: "The 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada"
ukrpol.102.d: "The Kyiv Trials delve into the responsibility of various groups and individuals involved in the failed Dyrektoria uprising. Among them, the focus now shifts to the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada, the frontier sentry responsible for maintaining the integrity of the Ukrainian borders and preventing unauthorized crossings. Their actions, or lack thereof, have come under scrutiny, with the prosecution claiming that they contributed to the success of the rebels by allowing their armed forces to enter Ukraine.\n\nThe 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada, entrusted with the defense of the region, played a critical role in safeguarding the borders during the Dyrektoria uprising. However, during the height of the rebellion, there were reports of lax enforcement and even instances where the sentry forces were disarmed or willingly stood aside, facilitating the entry of rebel forces into Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe prosecution argues that the actions, or rather the lack of action, by the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada were deliberate and indicate a collaboration with the Dyrektoria. They claim that members of the sentry sympathized with the rebels and allowed them to cross the border unhindered, effectively sabotaging the nation's defense and aiding the rebellion. The failure to fulfill their duty to protect the borders is seen as a grave betrayal of their sworn allegiance to the Hetmanate.\n\nOn the other hand, those defending the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada present a different perspective. They argue that the sentry forces were overwhelmed and ill-prepared to handle the sudden uprising. They claim that the rebels caught them off-guard and employed tactics that took advantage of their limited resources and manpower. Supporters assert that the sentry forces were not intentionally complicit with the Dyrektoria but rather found themselves in an untenable situation, unable to effectively counter the swift and organized rebel incursions.\nAdditionally, defenders of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada emphasize the psychological impact of the rebellion on the sentry forces. They argue that fear, confusion, and the risk of reprisals from the rebels may have influenced their actions or inaction during the critical moments when rebel forces breached the borders. They stress that while mistakes may have been made, it does not necessarily imply a deliberate act of betrayal.\n\nThe outcome of this trial will have significant implications for the perception of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada, as well as for the overall understanding of the events surrounding the Dyrektoria uprising. It will shape public opinion, potentially leading to reforms in border security and the military apparatus to prevent such vulnerabilities in the future."

ukrpol.103.t: "Anti-Hetmanist Conspiracy"
ukrpol.103.d: "As the Kyiv Trials continue, the focus now shifts to the presence of an Anti-Hetman conspiracy within the ranks of the Ukrainian armed forces. Startling revelations come to light, pointing towards the involvement of certain military leaders, particularly those with ties to the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), in actions that undermined the Hetmanate's authority and supported the Dyrektoria's cause.\nThe prosecution presents compelling evidence suggesting that a group of military officers within the armed forces held sympathies towards the Dyrektoria and conspired against the Hetmanate. Their sentiments were reportedly rooted in ideological differences, disillusionment with Hetman Skoropadskyi's rule, or perceived grievances against the Hetmanate's policies. These officers, belonging to the UVO or sympathizing with its ideals, were believed to have actively worked to undermine the Hetmanate from within.\n\nThe alleged Anti-Hetman conspiracy encompassed various activities aimed at weakening the Hetmanate's position and bolstering support for the Dyrektoria. This included dissemination of anti-Hetman propaganda among the ranks, recruitment efforts to sway soldiers' loyalty, and clandestine coordination with rebel forces during the Dyrektoria uprising. The prosecution argues that the actions of these military leaders directly contributed to the destabilization of the Hetmanate and endangered the nation's security.\n\nHowever, defenders of the accused military leaders present a counterargument. They claim that the involvement of these officers should be viewed in the context of a broader discontent within the armed forces, arising from legitimate concerns about the Hetmanate's policies and governance. Supporters contend that while certain officers may have expressed sympathies towards the Dyrektoria, it does not necessarily imply their direct involvement in subversive activities or a concerted effort to undermine the Hetmanate.\nThe defense further asserts that it is essential to distinguish between personal sentiments and actionable evidence of conspiracy. They emphasize that mere ideological disagreements or expressions of frustration with the Hetmanate's policies should not automatically brand these military leaders as traitors. They argue for a thorough examination of the evidence, calling for fairness and the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.\n\nThe implications of this Anti-Hetman conspiracy trial are significant for the Hetmanate's stability and the loyalty of its armed forces. A guilty verdict could lead to widespread purges within the military and a restructuring of the command hierarchy to ensure greater loyalty to the Hetmanate. Conversely, an acquittal or a lack of conclusive evidence may generate doubts about the extent of the conspiracy and raise questions about the prosecution's claims."

The court has diligently examined the evidence, testimonies, and arguments presented, aiming to hold accountable those responsible for their roles in the Dyrektoria uprising and the subsequent political unrest in Ukraine. Now, the time has come for the announcement of the trial's outcomes, which will significantly shape the path forward for the Hetmanate."
ukrpol.104.d_tradeunionban: "\n\nUpon careful consideration of the evidence and the testimonies presented during the trials, the Court becomes convinced that certain trade-union leaders actively participated in planning and supporting the Dyrektoria uprising. Their actions directly contributed to the destabilization of the Hetmanate and pose a threat to the nation's security.\nIn light of this realization, Hetman Skoropadskyi decides to hold the trade-union leaders accountable for their actions. The guilty leaders are stripped of their positions, and the trade-unions are placed under strict state control. This measure is intended to ensure that the trade-unions operate in accordance with the Hetmanate's interests and contribute to the nation's stability and development."
ukrpol.104.d_tradeunion: "\n\nThe defense lawyers representing the trade-unions argue that their involvement in the rebellion was not a collective decision but rather the result of individual members acting independently. They assert that punishing the entire trade-union movement would be unjust and hinder the nation's progress towards reconciliation and unity.\nThe Court considers this argument, taking into account the broader picture of national stability. Recognizing that the trade-unions have historically played a crucial role in advocating for workers' rights and social welfare, Hetman Skoropadskyi decides against punishing the entire trade-union movement. Instead, he emphasizes the need for unity and calls for a constructive dialogue between the trade-unions and the government to address any grievances and concerns."
ukrpol.104.d_frontierban: "\n\nIn the case of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada's involvement in the Dyrektoria uprising, the prosecution successfully presents evidence that demonstrates their negligence and collusion with the rebels. The court delivers a guilty verdict, holding the leadership of the Bryhada responsible for allowing the rebels to infiltrate Ukrainian territory and compromising the Hetmanate's security."
ukrpol.104.d_frontier: "\n\nIn the case of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada, the defense successfully argues that there is insufficient evidence to prove their deliberate collaboration with the rebels. The court delivers an acquittal, highlighting the lack of concrete proof linking the Bryhada's actions to intentional sabotage."
ukrpol.104.d_conspiracyban: "\n\nIn the case of the Anti-Hetman conspiracy, while the prosecution successfully proves the involvement of certain military leaders with sympathies towards the Dyrektoria, the court opts for lenient punishments due to the lack of concrete evidence linking them directly to subversive activities."
ukrpol.104.d_conspiracy: "\n\nIn the case of the Anti-Hetman conspiracy, the defense successfully argues that the evidence presented is inconclusive and fails to establish a clear connection between the accused military leaders and subversive activities. The court delivers an acquittal, highlighting the need for stronger evidence to prove their guilt beyond reasonable doubt."
ukrpol.104.d_ending: "\n\nAs the verdicts are read out in the courtroom, a profound sense of anticipation fills the air. The nation awaits the outcomes, which will undoubtedly have far-reaching consequences for the future of Ukraine. The decisions made by the court will determine the extent of punishments, potential reforms, and the course of action to be taken by the Hetmanate. The outcomes of the Kyiv Trials reverberate throughout Ukrainian society. They mark a critical moment in the Hetmanate's history, as they will shape the direction of the nation's recovery from the recent turmoil. With the trial's conclusion, the Hetmanate must now navigate the path towards stability, addressing the root causes of the unrest and ensuring the preservation of law and order."

ukrpol.105.t: "The Trade-Unions Case"
ukrpol.105.d: "After careful examination of the evidence and thorough deliberation, the court reaches a verdict that there is no need to punish the trade-unions for their alleged involvement in organizing and promoting strikes during the period of instability.\n\nThe defense successfully argues that the trade-unions were responding to the genuine concerns and grievances of the oppressed rural poor and urban workers. They emphasize that the strikes were a result of deteriorating living conditions, economic hardships, and a lack of representation rather than a deliberate attempt to undermine the Hetmanate.\n\nThe court acknowledges the role of the trade-unions in advocating for the rights and welfare of the working class. Instead of punishment, the court recommends constructive engagement and dialogue between the Hetmanate and the trade-unions to address the underlying issues that led to the strikes. It calls for the establishment of mechanisms to address workers' concerns and improve their working conditions, ensuring a more equitable society.\n\nThis verdict sparks mixed reactions among the population. Supporters of the trade-unions applaud the court's recognition of their legitimate grievances and advocate for stronger workers' rights. However, critics argue that the decision sets a dangerous precedent and may encourage further strikes and unrest in the future."
ukrpol.105.d2: "After careful examination of the evidence and extensive deliberation, the court finds the trade-unions guilty of actively organizing and promoting strikes during the period of instability, contributing to the unrest and undermining the Hetmanate's authority.\n\nThe court considers the trade-unions' actions as a threat to the stability and order of the Hetmanate. It deems their activities as an attempt to exert undue influence over the working class and disrupt the functioning of the state. As a result, the court imposes punishments and places all trade-unions under strict state control.\n\nUnder this verdict, the court orders the trade-union leaders to be held accountable for their actions. They face severe consequences, including imprisonment, fines, and the dissolution of their organizations. The court justifies its decision by emphasizing the need to maintain order, discipline, and loyalty to the Hetmanate.\n\nThis verdict triggers intense debate within the population. Supporters of the Hetmanate applaud the court's firm stance against perceived threats to the regime's authority. They view the punishment and state control as necessary measures to protect the Hetmanate's interests and maintain social order. However, opponents argue that such actions stifle freedom of association and undermine the rights of workers to advocate for their interests. The punishment and state control of trade-unions represent a strong assertion of the Hetmanate's power and its determination to maintain control over labor movements. It sends a clear message that dissenting voices and actions will face harsh consequences, ensuring the preservation of the Hetmanate's authority."

ukrpol.106.d: "To the surprise of many, the court declares the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada innocent of any deliberate wrongdoing or sabotage. The defense successfully argued that the unit faced overwhelming challenges during the uprising, including misinformation, divided loyalties, and limited resources. They emphasized that the actions of a few individuals should not tarnish the reputation of the entire unit.\n\nThe exoneration of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada leads to their reinstatement with full honors and the restoration of their previous responsibilities. The Hetmanate acknowledges the unit's loyalty and service to the nation, offering public recognition for their dedication in protecting the borders and maintaining order. This decision not only restores the unit's reputation but also helps to rebuild trust between the Hetmanate and the armed forces.\n\nThe exoneration brings a sense of relief and vindication to the soldiers of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada. They emerge from the trial with their integrity intact, ready to resume their duties and contribute to the stability and security of the Hetmanate. Their determination to defend the nation is reinforced, and their loyalty to the Hetmanate remains unwavering."
ukrpol.106.d2: "After careful deliberation, the court finds members of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada guilty of negligence and dereliction of duty in the face of the Dyrektoria uprising. The evidence presented demonstrates their failure to adequately secure the borders and prevent the infiltration of rebel forces. The court concludes that this negligence significantly contributed to the success of the uprising and the subsequent instability in the Hetmanate.\n\nAs a result, the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada is dissolved, and its members are reassigned to other units within the armed forces. This decision sends a clear message that the Hetmanate will not tolerate breaches of duty and negligence within its ranks. The dissolution of the unit serves as a strong deterrent, highlighting the consequences of failing to fulfill their responsibilities.\n\nThe reorganization of the unit is met with mixed reactions. Some members feel a deep sense of shame and remorse for their actions, while others express frustration and resentment at what they perceive as unjust punishment. The decision sparks debates within military circles and society at large, with opinions ranging from strong support for the Hetmanate's firm stance to concerns about potential divisions within the armed forces.\n\nThe dissolution and reorganization of the 1-sha Volynska Kordonna Bryhada represent a significant step in the Hetmanate's efforts to restore order and rebuild trust within the armed forces. By holding the unit accountable, the Hetmanate seeks to reinforce discipline and ensure that similar failures are not repeated in the future. The decision underscores the importance of maintaining the highest standards of duty, loyalty, and professionalism among the nation's military forces."

ukrpol.107.t: "The Anti-Hetman Conspiracy Trial Verdict"
ukrpol.107.d: "After careful examination of the evidence and deliberation, the court takes a lenient stance towards the accused leaders of the Anti-Hetman Conspiracy. Despite acknowledging their involvement and sympathies towards Dyrektoria, the court finds mitigating circumstances that influenced their actions. The defense successfully argues that the accused leaders were driven by a deep concern for the welfare of the Ukrainian people and their dissatisfaction with certain policies of the Hetmanate. They emphasize that their actions were not intended to harm the nation but rather to advocate for change and reforms that would benefit all Ukrainians.\n\nAs a result, the court decides against harsh punishment and instead recommends a process of reintegration and reconciliation. The accused leaders are required to make public apologies, express their loyalty to the Hetmanate, and commit themselves to upholding its principles and objectives. They are given the opportunity to remain in the military under strict surveillance and with limited responsibilities, allowing them to contribute positively to the nation while proving their renewed loyalty.\n\nThe lenient verdict sparks controversy and debate among the population. Supporters argue that this approach fosters unity and healing, preventing further division within the armed forces and the broader society. Critics, however, express concerns about potential future risks and question whether the Hetmanate should have been more resolute in punishing those involved in the conspiracy.\n\nThe leniency and reintegration of the accused leaders mark an attempt by the Hetmanate to address grievances, promote unity, and offer an olive branch to those disillusioned with the regime. It is a delicate balancing act aimed at stabilizing the nation while allowing for the possibility of change and progress."
ukrpol.107.d2: "After thorough examination of the evidence and deliberation, the court finds the accused leaders of the Anti-Hetman Conspiracy guilty of treachery and disloyalty to the Hetmanate. The court establishes their active involvement in plotting against the Hetmanate, collaborating with Dyrektoria, and undermining the stability of the nation.\n\nThe severity of their crimes leads the court to impose harsh punishments, including lengthy prison sentences, loss of rank, and dishonorable discharge from the armed forces. The court emphasizes the need to send a strong message that acts of betrayal and conspiracies against the Hetmanate will not be tolerated.\n\nThe verdict sparks a mixture of relief and outrage within the population. Supporters of the Hetmanate commend the court's decisive action, viewing it as a necessary step to safeguard the nation's integrity and deter future conspiracies. However, there are concerns about the potential repercussions of such a harsh response, including further divisions within the armed forces and the possibility of future uprisings.\n\nThe purge of the Anti-Hetman Conspiracy leaders represents a firm stance by the Hetmanate in upholding loyalty and weeding out dissent within its ranks. It sends a clear message that anyone who conspires against the Hetmanate will face severe consequences, ensuring the stability and security of the nation. However, the harsh punishments also raise questions about the regime's commitment to addressing grievances and fostering reconciliation within the military and the broader society."

ukrpol.108.d: "In the wake of the Dyrektoria uprising and the assassination of King Vasyl, Hetman Skoropadskyi moves swiftly to establish the Regency Council. Recognizing the need to address the future of the Ukrainian Kingdom and its empty throne, the Regency Council is tasked with making critical decisions regarding the nation's governance and the role of the monarchy.\n\nIvan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, a respected Cossack leader renowned for his unwavering commitment to Ukrainian traditions, is appointed to the Regency Council as the representative of the Cossack community. His deep understanding of Cossack values and aspirations will help shape the council's discussions regarding the monarchy's role in a modern Ukraine.\nRecognizing the economic significance of Ukraine's agrarian and industrial sectors, Hetman Skoropadskyi appoints representatives of influential landowners and industrialists to the Regency Council. These individuals bring with them their wealth, expertise, and influence, ensuring that the council's decisions account for the interests and concerns of these powerful economic elites.\nTo ensure security and stability in these tumultuous times, Hetman Skoropadskyi appoints the esteemed military leader Konstantyn Prysovskyi to the Regency Council.

He comes from a Cossack lineage and his ancestors ruled this land. In addition, the state built in Ukraine was the Skoropadskyi’s achievement, and the appointment of a new Austrian king will further deepen the division of the elites and the people. \n\nThe Hetman himself, however, has not yet stated that he definitely agrees to this proposal.

Among them, two prominent individuals emerge as the primary contenders:\n\nIntroduced at the initiative of the Austrian ambassador, Leo Stefan von Habsburg-Lothringen presents himself as a potential heir to the Ukrainian throne. As the nephew of the deceased King Vasyl, Leo Stefan carries the bloodline of the former monarch and represents a continuation of the foreign influence on Ukrainian affairs. Proponents argue that his heritage and upbringing make him a suitable candidate to uphold the traditions of the monarchy.\n\nAs a member of a noble Ukrainian family with Cossack roots, Hetman Skoropadskyi's candidacy is put forth, asserting his strong ties to the Ukrainian people. Having already established his leadership and governance during his tenure as Hetman, Skoropadskyi presents a vision of a united and prosperous Ukraine under his rule. Supporters highlight his deep understanding of Ukrainian culture, history, and aspirations, making him a viable candidate to lead the nation.\n\nFurthermore, the Regency Council acknowledges the contributions and merits of other candidates, such as Mykola Tobilevych, from an ancient Ukrainian Gentry family with Belarusian-Lithuanian and Polish origins. Tobilevych's family has played a significant role in the revival of Ukrainian national identity and the cultural development of the Ukrainian national theater. Although not as prominent as the main contenders, Tobilevych is regarded as a symbol of Ukrainian cultural heritage and artistic achievements.\n\nAs the council members engage in intense debates and consultations, they consider the aspirations and desires of the Ukrainian people, the need for stability, and the preservation of national identity. Ultimately, they must make a decision that reflects the interests and aspirations of the Ukrainian state. The approval of the list of heir candidates by the Regency Council marks a crucial step in determining the future of the Ukrainian monarchy. The decision will have far-reaching implications for the nation's governance, its relationship with foreign powers, and its path toward unity and prosperity.

In their announcement, they express gratitude for the service and sacrifice of the late King, emphasizing his contributions to the nation. However, faced with the reality of the situation, the Council determines that a new path must be forged to ensure the continued progress and well-being of Ukraine. As a result, the Regency Council proclaims the abolishment of the title of the King of All-Ukraine. They recognize the significance of the Hetmanate's historical roots and the deep connection to Ukrainian identity.

Embracing the customs of old, the organizers of the ceremony, led by the visionary Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, General Clerk of the Hetman's Chancellery and the esteemed 'gentleman usher' of Skoropadskyi's Court, meticulously recreate the time-honored rituals surrounding the election and investiture of a Hetman.\n\nAmidst the anticipation and excitement that fills the air, the General Cossack Rada is convened, representing the noble Ukrainian Cossack families. This gathering of esteemed representatives symbolizes the unity and collective will of the people to select their leader. Seated in the hallowed chambers of power, the Cossack Rada deliberates with reverence and deliberation, considering the merits and dedication of Pavlo Skoropadskyi.\n\nAfter a series of heartfelt speeches and affirmations of support, a momentous decision is reached.

Following this momentous declaration, the Metropolitan of Kyiv and of All-Ukraine, bearing the wisdom and spiritual authority, steps forward to bestow a sacred blessing upon the Hetman. With solemnity and grace, the Metropolitan presents Skoropadskyi with the ceremonial bulawa, a symbol of authority and leadership. Placing it gently in his hands, the Metropolitan offers prayers and blessings, invoking divine guidance and protection for the Hetman's rule. In this symbolic act, Pavlo Skoropadskyi, with the bulawa in his grasp and the blessings of the spiritual realm upon him, assumes the mantle of true sovereignty over All-Ukraine.

Several candidates emerge as potential contenders for the role of Otaman-Minister, each with their own unique qualities and potential impact on the Hetmanate.\n\nVasyl Kochubei, a distinguished member of the noble Kochubei family and a former Marshal of Nobility in the Poltava region under Imperial Russia, presents himself as a seasoned politician. As a member of the liberal Octobrist party in the 4th State Duma of Imperial Russia, Kochubei brings with him a wealth of political experience. Although affiliated with the VSZV and the Protofis, Kochubei is seen as a shadow of Hetman Skoropadskyi's shining personality, offering a steady and reliable hand in governing the nation.\n\nIn addition to Kochubei, another candidate emerges as a potential option: Mykola Mikhnovskyi, a hardened nationalist and author of the first draft of the Ukrainian Constitution. Mikhnovskyi, who recently returned from exile in Kuban, holds strong chauvinistic views and a charismatic nature. Despite his nationalist fervor and potential challenges to the Hetman's personalistic rule, Mikhnovskyi's leadership and deep understanding of Ukrainian national interests make him a compelling choice for the position of Otaman-Minister.\n\nHowever, amidst the deliberations, the Hetman himself considers an alternative path. Skoropadskyi contemplates assuming the role of Otaman-Minister, directly leading the government and taking on the responsibilities of governance as a sovereign ruler. This option would allow the Hetman to exercise full control over the decision-making process and assert his personal authority in shaping the future of Ukraine."

With a vision to assemble a capable team that can guide the nation towards progress and stability, Skoropadskyi looks towards trusted individuals who share his ideals and possess the necessary expertise.\n\nAmidst the deliberations, Hetman Skoropadskyi's gaze falls upon Vasyl Kochubei, a distinguished figure hailing from the esteemed noble family of the Kochubeis. Having served as the Marshal of Nobility in the Poltava region during the era of Imperial Russia, and later representing the liberal Octrobrist party in the 4th State Duma, Kochubei's experience and political acumen make him an intriguing candidate for an influential role in the new government.\n\nAlthough Kochubei is known for his liberal-mindedness, his affiliation with the VSZV and the Protofis raises questions about his alignment with the interests of the great landowners and major industrialists. Yet, it is widely recognized that Kochubei, while a prominent figure in his own right, largely operates in the shadow of Hetman Skoropadskyi's radiant personality, functioning as a loyal and trusted confidant.\n\nAlternatively, Hetman Skoropadskyi considers taking on the role of Otaman-Minister himself, assuming both the positions of head of state and head of government.

ukrpol.116.d: "In the quest to defend Ukraine's independence and strengthen the country's military capabilities, Hetman Skoropadskyi directs his attention towards supporting the Vilne Kozatstvo, also known as the Free Cossacks. These civil defense detachments and territorial paramilitary formations play a crucial role in safeguarding Ukraine's sovereignty.\n\nInitially, the Free Cossacks emerged as a response to the need for local defense during a tumultuous period in Ukraine's history. However, due to the demands of the German occupation command, they were disbanded in April 1918. Despite their disbandment, the Hetman recognized the importance of these brave fighters and the role they could play in rebuilding the Ukrainian army. Under the influence of Hetman Skoropadskyi and Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, the Free Cossacks make a resurgence, standing once again as a significant force within the Hetmanate. Their dedication to defending Ukraine's independence and their strong connection to the Cossack tradition capture the Hetman's attention, and he sees their potential as a vital pillar of power.\n\nUnderstanding the essence of their strength and the importance of providing them with necessary resources, the Hetman takes steps to secure additional funds for the Vilne Kozatstvo. Recognizing that financial support is crucial for their operations and growth, the Hetman's government allocates resources specifically dedicated to the needs of the Free Cossacks. The funding aims to enhance the Free Cossacks' capabilities by providing them with essential equipment, training, and logistical support. It enables them to operate effectively and defend Ukraine's independence with vigor and determination. The resurgence of the Free Cossacks, backed by the Hetman's support and additional funding, revitalizes their role as a formidable force within the Hetmanate. Their dedication, combined with the resources provided, ensures that the Vilne Kozatstvo can continue to play a significant role in defending Ukraine's independence and protecting the interests of the Hetmanate."

ukrpol.117.t: "Strengthening the Ukrainian Church"
ukrpol.117.d: "In a steadfast effort to restore and build Ukrainian churches, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi and his government undertake a monumental project that aims to preserve and showcase the rich spiritual heritage of the Ukrainian people. Recognizing the significance of these places of worship as symbols of national identity, the Hetman's government decides to allocate substantial resources to the restoration and construction of Ukrainian churches throughout the Hetmanate. Skoropadskyi understands that these physical structures not only serve as sacred spaces but also stand as testament to the resilience and cultural pride of the Ukrainian nation.\n\nUnder the guidance of the General Clerk of the Hetman's Chancellery, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, a dedicated committee is established to oversee the restoration and construction efforts. This committee, comprised of skilled architects, craftsmen, and experts in Ukrainian architecture, meticulously plans and executes the projects with utmost attention to detail. Throughout the Hetmanate, churches that have fallen into disrepair due to neglect or conflict are identified for restoration. Skilled artisans are commissioned to meticulously restore the intricate architectural elements, including ornate frescoes, iconography, and delicate woodwork. The restoration process aims to bring back the original splendor and grandeur of these sacred spaces, allowing future generations to connect with their historical and cultural roots.\n\nTo mark the completion of the restoration efforts, a grand ceremony is to be held, attended by Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, government officials, clergy, and members of the community. The Hetman plans to deliver a heartfelt address, emphasizing the importance of these restored and newly built churches as symbols of Ukrainian unity, spirituality, and cultural heritage. The event shall serve as a powerful reminder of the Hetmanate's commitment to preserving and showcasing the rich spiritual legacy of the Ukrainian people."

ukrpol.118.t: "The General Usher"
ukrpol.118.d: "As the Hetmanate solidifies under the rule of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, one figure stands out among the Hetman's close circle, General Usher Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. Ostrianytsia's influence within the Hetmanate's hierarchy continues to grow, raising questions about his political ambitions.\n\nKnown for his unwavering loyalty to the Hetman and his astute political acumen, Poltavets-Ostrianytsia has emerged as a key figure in the Hetmanate's administration. Holding the esteemed position of General Usher, he serves as the Hetman's trusted advisor, confidant, and coordinator of the Hetman's court affairs. Behind Ostrianytsia's seemingly loyal demeanor, there are whispers of his ambitions to restore the once privileged status of the Cossack class within the Hetmanate. Some believe that he envisions a return to a system where the Cossacks wielded considerable influence and enjoyed exclusive privileges in society.\n\nOstrianytsia's aspirations are not without support. Among certain circles, particularly among traditionalists and those who make a fetish of the glory days of the First Hetmanate, there is a growing sentiment that the Cossack class deserves a more prominent role in the new order. They argue that the restoration of Cossack privileges would be a step towards reclaiming the Hetmanate's historical identity and safeguarding its traditions.\n\nThe Hetman, aware of the growing influence and ambitions of Ostrianytsia, carefully treads the line between acknowledging the historical importance of the Cossack legacy and maintaining a fair and just society for all. While he appreciates Ostrianytsia's dedication and service, the Hetman remains cautious about rushing into sweeping changes that could potentially disrupt the harmony and unity within the Hetmanate."

ukrpol.119.t: "Anti-Russophile Coup!"
ukrpol.119.d: "Hetman has always been a Russophile. This is a truth that neither his words nor his policies will change. Throughout practically his entire reign, Hetman repeatedly asserted that Ukraine is and will be independent, conducted Ukrainization, and all of his reforms were for the benefit of the Ukrainian people. However, this could not change the fact that his regime supported the Russophiles - Protofis and VSZV in every possible way. Finally, after the fall of the German markets, the uprising of the Dyrektoria, albeit a failure, Hetman directed his resources to a more reliable, in his eyes, partnership - with the bear rising from the ruins in the east. But his efforts were in vain, no matter how they would have ended, for the bear would still have attacked and taken back what he considered his own.\n\nA separate hotbed of Russophilia was the armed forces-where generals who had served the Empire for years had never been able to disassociate themselves from their past. That is why today, with the support of the Sich Striltsi, the general staff was disarmed and arrested, and the Hetman himself, who was in his personal residence, was taken by surprise by the armed men who arrested him. Under the sights of Mausers the Hetman was forced to sign a statement of his own abdication; it soon became known that Hetmanych, who had unfortunately been in Kyiv today, has also been arrested and renounced his right of succession. This is the end of the Skoropadskyi dynasty, but who was the beneficiary of this dastardly, according to some, crime against Ukraine?\n\nAnd we will answer you: the Ukrainian people, from the Carpathians to the Caucasus, all of them, one and indivisible, have now overcome the power and arbitrariness of the big bourgeoisie and Russophiles, who want to sell their homeland for 30 pieces of silver. But who will take the \"throne\" now?"

ukrpol.120.d: "Recognizing the need for a capable and loyal bureaucracy to effectively govern the Hetmanate, Hetman Skoropadskyi initiates comprehensive reforms aimed at enhancing administrative efficiency and combating corruption. With a vision to create a more streamlined and merit-based civil service, the Hetmanate undertakes a series of measures to revamp the recruitment and promotion processes. The emphasis shifts towards meritocracy, prioritizing qualifications, skills, and experience.\n\nIn addition to merit, loyalty to the Hetmanate becomes a fundamental criterion for appointment and advancement within the civil service. Recognizing the importance of unwavering commitment to the Hetman's principles, policies, and vision, those who demonstrate loyalty are given preference in the selection process. To enhance the skills and capabilities of civil servants, the government invests in training and capacity-building programs. These initiatives aim to develop a highly competent and knowledgeable civil service that can effectively implement the Hetmanate's reform agenda.\n\nThrough these bureaucratic reforms, the Hetmanate aims to create a competent and loyal civil service that can effectively serve the needs of the nation. The commitment to administrative efficiency, meritocracy, and accountability lays the foundation for a streamlined and effective government apparatus. The reforms empower the Hetmanate to address the challenges and aspirations of its people with greater efficiency, fairness, and transparency."

ukrpol.121.t: "Combating Banditry in Odesa"
ukrpol.121.d: "The rampant banditry and criminal activities in the region of Odesa have become a pressing concern for the Hetmanate, threatening the stability and security of the area. Among the notorious criminal groups operating in the region is Yaponchik's crime band, led by the infamous criminal mastermind, Yaponchik himself. Recognizing the urgent need to address this issue and restore law and order, the Derzhavna Varta launches a comprehensive operation to combat banditry, with a specific focus on dismantling Yaponchik's crime band. This operation aims to protect the lives and property of the citizens, as well as to uphold the authority of the Hetmanate.\n\nIntelligence gathering becomes a key component of the operation, as information on the activities and whereabouts of Yaponchik's crime band is collected meticulously. Special task forces are formed to conduct targeted raids, surveillance operations, and undercover investigations to gather evidence against the criminals.\n\nThe operation unfolds with calculated precision, as the Hetmanate's forces move in on Yaponchik's crime band. Raids are conducted at their hideouts, known meeting places, and areas of criminal activity. Law enforcement personnel, armed with the necessary intelligence, apprehend key members of the bandit group, disrupting their operations and dismantling their criminal network. The Hetmanate's determination to rid the region of banditry sends a clear message that criminal activities will not be tolerated. Through this operation, the Hetmanate aims to restore law and order, ensuring the safety and well-being of the citizens of Odesa and its surrounding areas.\n\nAs the operation progresses, the Hetmanate remains resolute in its commitment to combat banditry. Continuous efforts are made to apprehend those who evade capture, ensuring that they are brought to justice. The operation serves as a testament to the Ukraine's unwavering dedication to protecting its citizens and establishing a secure environment for all."

ukrpol.123.t: "Fate of the Freikorps"
ukrpol.123.d: "The situation with Freikorps, an armed formation made up of German volunteer soldiers, is becoming increasingly tense. [ROOT.GetLeader] and his ministers were faced with two main options. The government could choose to integrate the Freikorps directly into the Ukrainian army or disband the formation altogether. Recognizing the potential costs and benefits of each choice, the decision was met with fierce debates among politicians and military officials alike.\n\nIntegrating the Freikorps into the army seemed to be the most straightforward approach. The German volunteers, experienced and battle-hardened, would provide a significant boost to the Ukrainian army's capabilities. Yet, some argued that the very nature of the Freikorps — foreign fighters with no direct connection to the Ukrainian people — would cause internal strife and resentment among the regular army ranks.\n\nOn the other hand, disbanding the Freikorps was not without its challenges. Forcing these soldiers to leave their new homes in Ukraine might create tensions in an already uneasy relationship with Germany. In addition, there were risks associated with releasing a vast number of armed and trained soldiers into a society that was still struggling with political and economic stability.\n\nAfter much deliberation, it was announced that the government has finally reached a decision..."

ukrpol.125.t: "Consolidating the Coalition"
ukrpol.125.d: "In a historic move towards consolidating the Hetmanist movement, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi and Viacheslav Lypynskyi, the influential leader of the USKhD, embark on a journey of reconciliation and unity. Their shared goal is to create a stronger and more cohesive Hetmanate that can effectively govern Ukraine and promote the ideals of Ukrainian conservatism. Recognizing the significance of Lypynskyi's intellectual contributions and his unwavering commitment to Ukrainian statehood, the Hetman initiates direct talks with him. Both leaders understand the importance of setting aside their differences and finding common ground to propel the Hetmanist movement forward. In a series of meetings, the Hetman and Lypynskyi engage in open and honest discussions, acknowledging past disagreements while focusing on the shared vision of a strong and united Ukraine. They recognize that their combined efforts can forge a formidable force capable of leading the nation to new heights. During these conversations, the Hetman expresses his admiration for Lypynskyi's ideological contributions and acknowledges the need for his expertise in the government. Understanding the significance of Lypynskyi's role as a unifying figure, the Hetman proposes that Lypynskyi assume the position of Otaman-Minister, serving as his right-hand and trusted advisor.\n\nLypynskyi, deeply moved by the Hetman's gestures of reconciliation and recognizing the Hetman's commitment to the ideals of Ukrainian conservatism, agrees to the proposition. He believes that the united front between their parties will bring coherence and strength to the Hetmanist movement, allowing for effective governance and the preservation of Ukrainian traditions. Following their decision, the Hetman and Lypynskyi announce the merger of their respective parties, the Ukrainian Union of Agrarian-Statists and the Union of Hetmanists-Statists. The newly formed party, under the SHD banner, represents a significant milestone in the history of Ukrainian politics, bringing together two influential factions under a common banner.\n\nThe announcement of the Skoropadskyi-Lypynskyi reconciliation and the formation of the united SHD reverberates throughout Ukraine, sparking a renewed sense of hope and optimism among Hetmanist supporters. The unity demonstrated by these two influential leaders instills confidence in the future of the Hetmanate and its ability to govern with strength, wisdom, and a deep respect for Ukrainian values, guided by the principles of the Ukrainian conservatism."

ukrpol.126.t: "Monarchists Without Monarch"
ukrpol.126.d: "In a strategic move to foster unity and broaden the support base of the Hetmanate, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi initiates coalition talks with the USKhD leaders. Recognizing their significant cadres and the need for a more inclusive government, the Hetman seeks to make certain concessions while retaining his authority. The coalition talks take place in a dignified setting, where representatives from the Hetmanate and the USKhD gather to discuss the terms of collaboration. The atmosphere is one of cautious optimism, as both sides understand the importance of finding common ground for the stability and progress of Ukraine. During the negotiations, the Hetman expresses his respect for the USKhD's commitment to Ukrainian conservatism and their valuable contributions to the nation. He acknowledges the limitations they face in supporting a monarchial figure, given the absence of a viable candidate for the throne. Nevertheless, the Hetman recognizes the potential of the USKhD's members and their expertise in shaping the future of Ukraine.\n\nTo bridge the gap and accommodate the USKhD's concerns, the Hetman proposes several concessions. He agrees to incorporate elements of the USKhD's 'Praktichna Politika', put forward by Serhiy Shemet, one of the USKhD leaders. This policy emphasizes a more realistic and plausible approach to engaging allies and citizens, with a focus on practicality and bringing Ukrainian conservatism to everyday life. Furthermore, the Hetman pledges to create space for the USKhD's leaders within the Hetmanate's government structure. This includes appointing USKhD representatives to key positions, ensuring their voices are heard and their expertise utilized in policy-making and governance. While the Hetman does not relinquish his ultimate authority, he demonstrates a willingness to share power and collaborate with the USKhD.\n\nAs news of the coalition talks spreads, there is a cautious optimism among supporters of both the Hetmanate and the USKhD. Many see this as a positive step towards unity and stability, with the potential to harness the expertise and resources of the USKhD to further advance the Hetmanate's goals. The success of the coalition talks sets the stage for the Hetman's subsequent visit to Viacheslav Lypynskyi, the leader of the USKhD, where further discussions will take place and the Hetman's vision for a united and strong organization will continue to unfold."
ukrpol.126.d2: "In his continuous efforts to unite and strengthen the Hetmanist movement, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi initiates an alliance with the USKhD. Recognizing the USKhD's influential position and dedicated cadres, the Hetman sees an opportunity to create a powerful coalition that can further the interests of Ukraine. Through a series of discussions and negotiations, the Hetman and USKhD leaders explore the terms of their alliance. They seek to find common ground while respecting the diverse perspectives within their respective factions. The Hetman expresses a willingness to accommodate the aspirations of the USKhD within the Hetmanist movement as he offers influential positions within the government to USKhD leaders, recognizing their expertise and dedication to Ukrainian conservatism. The USKhD leaders, in turn, pledge their support to the Hetmanate and commit to promoting Ukrainian conservatism within the framework of a united Hetmanist movement. They agreed to recognize the Hetman's leadership and his vision for Ukraine.\n\nThe announcement of the alliance between the Hetman and the USKhD generates a mix of enthusiasm and cautious optimism among Hetmanist supporters. The prospect of a united front, incorporating the influential cadres of the USKhD, invigorates the movement and instills hope for a more cohesive and effective Hetmanate. The alliance between the Hetman and the USKhD marks a significant milestone in the Hetmanist movement, bringing together diverse factions under a common banner. It sets the stage for a collaborative and united approach to governance, where the Hetman's leadership and the USKhD's influence can drive positive change and progress for Ukraine."

ukrpol.127.d: "As the state finally recovers from Black Monday and the fallout of the Dyrektoria-staged revolts gradually diminishes, we can now begin our great land reform project. Ten years ago, the Hetman's government drew up a controversial land reform plan that was deemed too moderate by the USKhD conservatives and too radical by landowning lobbyists - in hindsight, it was clear from the beginning that it would not succeed. Nonetheless, the failed Dyrektoria uprising has taught us that if the Hetman's state is to survive, we must learn from our mistakes and improvise greatly. The real work begins now."

ukrpol.128.t: "Regarding Cooperation with VSZV and Protofis"
ukrpol.128.d: "As the state begins to embark on its ambitious land reform and industrialisation projects, a crucial debate is ongoing in the Council of Ministers regarding the status of VSZV and Protofis. Otaman-Minister, along with most in the Council of Ministers, have encouraged the Hetman to sack the main representative of the Protofis assembly, as well as the principal official tied to Great Landowner Faction in the Union of Landowners, Borys Butenko, from the cabinet. They argue that economic policies brought about from ties to Protofis and the Union resulted in the crisis and the revolt that came with it, and that the presence of such a lobby contradicts the vision of the new Hetmanate the SHD is trying to build.\n\nButenko, speaking on behalf of VSZV and Protofis, has defended their position by citing the economic growth brought to the country and crediting the rapport between the alliance and the government as the main reason for Ukraine's economy being one of the largest in the Reichspakt. Nonetheless, the final decision is up to the Hetman."
ukrpol.128.a: "Dismiss them."
ukrpol.128.b: "They could be useful..."

ukrpol.129.t: "Rise of the 'Russophiles'"
ukrpol.129.d: "Against the backdrop of a society deeply skeptical of Russian influence, the Russophiles, represented by the VSZV and Protofis, have become increasingly influential within the Hetmanate. Their united focus on lobbying for landowning and industrialist interests has allowed them to maintain a favorable relationship with the Hetman's government, attracting investments and driving economic growth.\nHowever, the recent expansionist ambitions of Russia and their refusal to recognize Ukrainians as equals have intensified anti-Russian sentiments among the population. Many Ukrainians view the rise of Russophile parties with apprehension, fearing that it may further entrench Russian influence within their nation and compromise their aspirations for independence and self-determination.\n\nThe decision to establish their own political parties reflects the Russophiles' desire to consolidate their influence and create a formal platform to advance their agenda. Recognizing the need for a structured approach, they initiate the process of forming party structures and regional organs of representation throughout the Hetmanate. As the VSZV and Protofis leaders convene to discuss the formation of their parties, they are aware of the societal resistance they may face. They are cognizant of the prevailing anti-Russian sentiment and the need to address the concerns of the Ukrainian people. To navigate this challenging environment, the Russophile party leaders emphasize their commitment to the Hetmanate's interests and present their parties as advocates for economic growth and stability. They aim to demonstrate that their agenda aligns with the broader goals of the nation, such as job creation, investment attraction, and enhancing the Hetmanate's position on the international stage.\n\nHowever, the establishment of Russophile parties once again raises questions about the Hetman's political affiliation. Some sections of society perceive the Hetman as being too closely aligned with Russian interests, particularly due to his cooperation with the VSZV and Protofis. This further fuels debates and divisions within the Hetmanate, with supporters defending his choices as necessary for economic development, while critics demand a clearer stance on the nation's sovereignty and Ukrainian identity."

ukrpol.130.t: "Abolition of Crimean Autonomy"
ukrpol.130.d: "Today, with approval from Otaman-Minister [GetSecondInCommand] and the Hetman, Crimea's autonomous status has been revoked. The decision - unusually, not a unanimous one - is the latest in a series of administrative reforms aimed at centralising power around the Hetman's government and a move justified by citing bureaucratic bloat and systemic inefficiencies in the Crimean government. For those building the new vision of a Hetmanate, such legal barriers can no longer be allowed to stand - if a law does not serve the needs of a rational and efficient state, then it must be set aside.\nThe decision has been a highly contentious one. During the deliberations, it was brought up repeatedly among the Council of Ministers that revoking Crimea's autonomy could have serious consequences and lead to separatism - the demographics of Crimea are remarkably mixed, consisting of Ukrainians, Tatars, as well as ethnic Russians and Russophones, many of whom have greatly appreciated the autonomy that had previously been granted to them. Indeed, the autonomy of Crimea was arguably instrumental to their accession into the Ukrainian State to begin with - and now that it's gone, the local popular reaction has been resoundingly negative.\n\nA solution was quickly found in the previous head of the Crimean government, Suleiman Sulkeyvych, who the council made a proposal to appoint as the Crimean Representative in the Council of Ministers. While he would not have the supreme veto over Crimean affairs that he once did, his presence and influence would give him a large voice in handling the government of Crimea, second only to the Otaman-Minister and the Hetman. Although not a particularly popular politician, Sulkeyvych's words carry great weight among the Crimean people, and his reassurances to the people have brought a degree of calm to the public outcry.\n\nNot long after the signing of the bill into law, Russia's foreign minister spoke of the move, accusing the government of oppressing ethnic Russians and Russian speakers and of imagined Ukrainian \"atrocities\". Foreign minister Adam Montrezor responded by stating that there is no such intention, reiterating that the move was to streamline the administration, not to oppress Russians, and further decried Russia as attempting to stir separatism."

ukrpol.131.t: "Establishment of Hereditary Rule"
ukrpol.131.d: "In a significant move to ensure a smooth transition of power within the Hetmanate, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi proclaims his son, Danylo Skoropadskyi, as the official heir to the Hetman's bulawa, the symbol of Hetman's authority. This decision aims to secure the continuity of the Hetmanist rule and establish a clear line of succession. With the Hetmanate at a crucial juncture in its history, Hetman Skoropadskyi recognizes the importance of a stable and orderly transition of leadership. By designating his son as the heir, he seeks to provide a sense of stability and legitimacy to the future governance of the Hetmanate as well as fulfill the 'Didychna Monarkhyia' principles of Ukrainian Conservatism.\n\nThe proclamation of Danylo Skoropadskyi as the official heir to the Hetman's bulawa is met with mixed reactions among the populace. Supporters of the Hetmanate perceive it as a strategic move to maintain the unity and authority of the Hetmanate, ensuring a smooth transfer of power within the Skoropadskyi family. They view Danylo as a suitable candidate to carry on the legacy of his father and uphold the principles of the Hetmanist movement. The oppositional forces express concerns regarding the concentration of power within a single family, despite their 'nobility' status. Critics argue that this decision reinforces a dynastic approach to governance, even not widespread among the traditional Hetmanate of the past. In response to these concerns, Hetman Skoropadskyi emphasizes that the line of succession does not imply an absolute hereditary rule. Instead, he reaffirms the importance of upholding the principles of Ukrainian conservatism and the Hetmanate's commitment to the welfare and aspirations of the Ukrainian people. The Hetman also underscores that the selection of Danylo as the heir is not solely based on familial ties but on his character and commitment to the Hetmanist ideals. Danylo Skoropadskyi has shown dedication to the service of the Hetmanate and has demonstrated his capabilities in various official capacities.\n\nThe proclamation of Danylo Skoropadskyi as the official heir to the Hetman's bulawa not only ensures a clear line of succession but also provides a sense of stability and continuity for the future of the Hetmanate. It solidifies the Skoropadskyi family's position within the Hetmanist movement and reinforces their commitment to upholding the values and principles of Ukrainian conservatism."

The influx of emigrants intensified after the conclusion of the Weltkrieg: Ukrainians were leaving the war- and revolution-devastated lands of Austria and the former Russian Empire.\n\nDespite Hetmanych's nobility, [ROOT.GetLeader] did not have time to receive him, but he was received by our Minister of Foreign Affairs with a short visit. Subsequently, Hetmanych spent most of his time in the small villages and towns of Canada where Ukrainians live, gaining unprecedented popularity among the local population and greatly fuelling the Ukrainians' intention to return to their homeland. \n\nWho knows, perhaps in the future, when Hetmanych becomes Hetman, Canada and Ukraine will establish good relations."
ukrpol.132.a: "Great, considering our sizeable Ukrainian diaspora!"

ukrpol.133.t: "Hetmanych Visits Canada!"
ukrpol.133.d: "One important foreign policy event this year was Hetmanych of Ukraine Danylo Skoropadskyi’s visit to [CAN.GetName], home to two hundred thousand Ukrainians.\nThe mass resettlement of Ukrainians in Canada began in the late 19th century, when the Canadian government actively encouraged large-scale emigration from Eastern Europe. The initiator of the mass migration of Ukrainians to Canada is said to be Yosyp Oleskov: he visited Canada in 1895 and was fascinated by its possibilities for agricultural development. His public lectures and his pamphlets \"On Free Land\" and \"On Emigration\" encouraged many peasants, mainly from Galicia, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia, to migrate to the large expanses of Canada. Until the beginning of the Weltkrieg, over 170,000 Ukrainians had left for Canada. After the end of the Weltkrieg, mass emigration continued: Ukrainians left the war-torn and revolution-ravaged lands of Austria and the former Russian Empire.\n\nHetmanych's visit to Canada is an important and symbolic step for many Ukrainians living there, who rarely hear about their homeland, only snippets from newspapers and few radio broadcasts. Nevertheless, emigrants have formed a number of unions on a Conservative Hetmanist basis, growing from educational and sporting communities and clubs into full-fledged organizations. The largest of these, the 'Soiuz Hetmantsiv-Derzhavnykiv u Pivnichnii Amerytsi' ('Union of Hetmanists-Statists in North America'), was formed from a similar society formerly known as the Canadian Sich Organization.\n\nHetmanych met with the leader of the SHDPA, Volodymyr Bosyi, and visited some of the largest villages and towns of Ukrainians in Canada, gaining unprecedented popularity among emigrants and promising to return again."

ukrpol.134.d: "Although previously part of the Hetman's coalition, the USKhD fell out of favour with the Hetman after he focused his efforts on stregthening his own personal power. Nonetheless, the USKhD may be useful - while they do not share opinions on most things with the SHD, they do agree with some of its most important tenets, most notably the doctrine of Ukrainian Conservatism and suppression of the leftists.\n\nIn any case, the USKhD could be brought to the SHD's side, which would surely work towards the expansion of the SHD as a mass organisation. Opinions vary on to what extent we should attempt to absorb the willing members of this organisation; should we seek to bring them to our cause at any cost, or is the effort not worth potentially making the SHD a disunited organisation?"

ukrpol.135.d: "The absorption of many of the willing members of the USKhD into the SHD has been the straw that broke the camel's back for the former. When Black Monday hit Ukraine and the country was thrown into civil war months later, the small, yet influential movement believed they could have taken advantage of the turmoil and become the dominant organisation in the Hetman's coalition. Some have gone as far to say that Skoropadskyi once planned on appointing Serhii Shemet, the leader of the organisation, due to his personal closeness with the Hetman.\n\nLately, the already small organisation's membership has dwindled owing to the SHD's efforts to bring them into the government. Many of the less ideologically inclined and more pragmatic members of the organisation flocked to the SHD. With these developments, Mykola Kochubei, the main ideologue of the USKhD, has opted to dissolve the organisation, owing to its insignificant membership and lack of funding and support. In its place, Kochubei and the movement's most influential thinkers have rebranded the movement to the \"Brotherhood of Classocrats-Monarchists\", more accurately representing their main ideas.

Word of the event spread throughout the land, attracting thousands of spectators from all corners of the Hetmanate.

Dressed in resplendent regalia, he personified the image of a mighty Hetman, exuding power and authority. The crowd erupted in cheers and applause, acknowledging his presence and demonstrating their unwavering loyalty. Accompanying the Hetman were his trusted advisers, military commanders, and high-ranking officials, all meticulously chosen for their unwavering allegiance to his rule. They rode alongside him, creating an impressive procession that showcased the might and unity of the Hetmanate. The parade unfolded with a series of dazzling displays, including equestrian performances and cultural presentations. Soldiers showcased their skills and discipline, while artists and performers from across the Hetmanate showcased the richness of Ukrainian culture.

He spoke of the greatness of the Ukrainian Hetmanate, its rich history, and the vision he had for its future. With eloquence and charisma, he emphasized the need for strong leadership and unwavering unity to overcome the challenges facing the nation. The crowd listened in awe, captivated by the Hetman's words and inspired by his unwavering determination. They pledged their allegiance and support, reaffirming their commitment to the Hetmanate and its ruler.\n\nThis parade of strength and unity became a defining moment in the consolidation of Hetman Skoropadskyi's absolutist rule.

The event further solidified his position as the supreme leader of the Hetmanate, ensuring the continuation of his personalistic dictatorship for years to come."
ukrpol.137.d2: "In an attempt to showcase his accomplishments and rally support, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi organized an elaborate event. This grand spectacle was meant to highlight the Hetman's achievements in governance, economic reforms, and efforts to unify the Hetmanate. However, despite the grandeur and carefully crafted scenario, the event turned out to be a stunning failure, revealing the deep discontent and lack of support for the Hetman's rule.\n\nTje event was held in the heart of Kyiv, meticulously planned to impress and captivate the audience. Elaborate decorations adorned the streets, and a sense of anticipation filled the air. However, as the event unfolded, it became apparent that the Hetman's grip on power was tenuous, and his reforms had failed to gain widespread approval. The grand parade, intended to showcase the Hetman's military strength and national unity, was met with lukewarm applause and disinterested stares. The crowd's lack of enthusiasm highlighted the growing disillusionment with the Hetman's autocratic rule and his failure to address the pressing needs and aspirations of the people. During the event, speeches were delivered to highlight the Hetman's governance achievements. However, the carefully crafted rhetoric failed to resonate with the audience, who were well aware of the problems and challenges that persisted under the Hetman's rule. The promises of prosperity and unity rang hollow amidst the stark reality of economic stagnation, social unrest, and political discord. A central feature of the event was the exhibition showcasing the Hetman's reforms. Yet, as attendees perused the displays, they couldn't help but notice the glaring gaps and shortcomings in the implementation of these initiatives. The discontented murmurs grew louder, revealing the dissatisfaction with the Hetman's inability to deliver meaningful change and improve the lives of the people. Despite efforts to project an image of strength and stability, the Hetman's dwindling support was unmistakable. The lackluster attendance and subdued atmosphere conveyed a collective sense of disillusionment and a growing desire for alternative leadership and governance.\n\nWhat was intended to be a triumphant display of the Hetman's rule, turned into a stark portrayal of his precarious position and the deep-rooted problems facing the Hetmanate. It became a powerful symbol of the waning support for the Hetman and the need for a more responsive and democratic form of governance. As the event concluded, the Hetman was left to grapple with the sobering reality that his rule had not garnered the widespread backing he had hoped for. It served as a harsh wake-up call, urging him to reassess his policies, engage with the concerns of the people, and seek alternative paths to address the challenges facing the Hetmanate."

The event had stirred suspense among the general public and sent shockwaves through the government, leaving both questioning the viability of the Hetman's autocratic regime. The failure had a profound impact on the collective psyche of the people. It shattered the illusion carefully crafted by the Hetman's propaganda machine, revealing the deep discontent and disillusionment that had been festering beneath the surface. The public's murmurs of discontent grew louder and more defiant, reflecting their dissatisfaction with the Hetman's rule and the lack of progress in addressing their grievances. The public began openly questioning the Hetman's legitimacy and ability to lead. Whispers of dissent echoed through the streets, gathering momentum and fostering a growing sense of defiance against the absolutist rule that had dominated their lives.\n\nThe shattered illusion of absolutism cast a shadow of uncertainty over the future of the Hetmanate.

ukrpol.140.t: "The Hetman's Speech of Illusory Hope"
ukrpol.140.d: "In a momentous public gathering, Hetman Skoropadskyi stood before a sea of eager faces, delivering a carefully crafted speech that seemed to hold the promise of change and a glimmer of hope for the Ukrainian people. The occasion marked the announcement of the convocation of the Ukrainian Soim, a body that had been dissolved under the Hetman's rule. With an air of authority, Hetman Skoropadskyi addressed the assembled crowd, his words resonating with a mixture of optimism and caution. He spoke of the need for unity among the Ukrainian people, emphasizing the importance of working together to achieve progress and prosperity. His speech alluded to a certain hope for liberalization, enticing the audience with the possibility of a brighter future.\n\nAmidst the atmosphere of anticipation, however, the autocratic nature of the regime remained evident. The ban on socialist press and leftist parties, such as those affiliated with the Dyrektoria, persisted. The oppressive measures that stifled freedom of expression and curtailed political dissent continued to cast a shadow over the Hetmanate. As the Hetman's words echoed through the crowd, there was a sense of both expectation and disappointment. The people longed for genuine change, but the autocratic grip of the regime was not easily shaken. The ban on public meetings and strikes, symbols of collective mobilization and resistance, served as constant reminders that the regime's iron-fisted control remained intact.\n\nAs the crowd dispersed, the illusions of liberalization and meaningful reform began to fade. The people were left grappling with the reality that despite the Hetman's rhetoric, the regime's grip on power remained firm and the aspirations for a more democratic society felt distant and unattainable. In the days that followed, the Ukrainian people grappled with the contradictions embedded within the Hetman's speech. They understood that the path to true change would require resilience, determination, and a collective effort to challenge the autocratic forces that held sway over their lives. The struggle for a just society would continue, fueled by the lingering hope that one day the promises made in the Hetman's speech would become a tangible reality."

ukrpol.141.d: "The long-awaited elections to the Ukrainian Soim finally took place, heralded as a potential turning point for the nation. However, the outcome of these elections dashed the hopes of those who yearned for a more diverse political landscape. The ruling SHD party, backed by the might of the Hetmanate, maintained a firm grip over the political arena, leaving other parties and factions in the shadows.\n\nAs the election results were announced, it became painfully clear that the ruling party's dominance remained unchallenged. The SHD secured a sweeping majority of seats in the Soim, consolidating their power and control over the decision-making process. The insignificant presence of other parties and factions underscored the lack of true political diversity and meaningful opposition within the Hetmanate. With the appointment of Vasyl Kochubei, a wealthy landowner from the Poltava region, as the new Otaman-Minister, any lingering hopes of a more progressive government were swiftly dashed as well. Kochubei's appointment symbolized the continuation of the regime's autocratic grip, with little regard for the aspirations and concerns of the broader Ukrainian population.\n\nThe nation stood impassive, confronted by the stark reality that the regime was firmly entrenched and showed no signs of relinquishing its hold on power. The people's hopes for a genuine democratic transformation were met with disappointment and resignation. It became increasingly clear that the Hetmanate was here to stay, and the dreams of a democracy were fading into the realm of distant aspirations."

ukrpol.142.d: "Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, recognizing the need for a robust and efficient administrative apparatus, makes a significant decision to emphasize the old bureaucratic system that has been gradually established in the Hetmanate over the past years. This system draws inspiration from the Imperial Russian bureaucracy and aristocracy, renowned for its hierarchical structure and adherence to established protocols.\n\nUnder the guidance of Hetman Skoropadskyi, the government initiates a series of reforms aimed at strengthening and streamlining the bureaucratic machinery. The key objective is to establish a merit-based system that prioritizes loyalty to the Hetmanate.\nThe hierarchical structure of the bureaucracy is reinforced, creating clear lines of authority and accountability. Departments and ministries are organized based on functional areas, allowing for efficient coordination and collaboration among different branches of the government. The establishment of clear protocols and procedures ensures that decision-making processes are streamlined and executed in a systematic manner.\n\nBy emphasizing the traditional bureaucratic system, Hetman Skoropadskyi aims to instill a sense of stability and order within the administration. The use of established protocols and practices helps to maintain consistency and predictability in governance, however, at the same time potentially increasing elitism and exclusion."

ukrpol.143.t: "Emulation of Old Russia"
ukrpol.143.d: "Under the leadership of Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, Ukraine undergoes a gradual transformation that sees it increasingly resemble the old Russian Empire in various aspects, encompassing not only the structure and systems but also the way of life. This shift reflects the Hetman's vision of establishing a strong and centralized state reminiscent of the past imperial glory. One prominent area where the influence of the old Russian Empire is observed is in the realm of governance. The administrative structure of Ukraine closely mirrors that of the former empire, with ministries, departments, and bureaucratic ranks reminiscent of their imperial counterparts. In addition to the administrative framework, the Hetmanate seeks to emulate the grandeur and cultural heritage of the old Russian Empire. Architectural projects are initiated to construct buildings that bear resemblance to the monumental structures of Saint Petersburg and Moscow. Palaces, government buildings, and cultural institutions are designed in neoclassical or baroque styles reminiscent of the imperial era, emphasizing grandeur and opulence.\n\nFurthermore, the social fabric of the Hetmanate begins to mirror certain aspects of the old Russian Empire's way of life. Aristocratic circles and high society emerge, with elite gatherings, balls, and formal events becoming an integral part of the social calendar. The nobility and upper class enjoy privileges and distinctions, mirroring the hierarchical class structure prevalent in the imperial era.\n\nMoreover, the Hetmanate's economic policies draw inspiration from the old Russian Empire. Large landowners, akin to the Russian aristocracy, wield significant influence and control over vast estates and agricultural resources. Industrial development follows a similar trajectory, with the emergence of large industrialists and business tycoons who dominate key sectors of the economy.\n\nWhile some view this shift as a means to restore stability and order, the nationalists within the government make it clear that the transformation of Ukraine into a small old Russian Empire is not without controversy. The rising concerns about the potential erosion of Ukrainian identity and the concentration of power in the hands of a privileged few, as well as the emphasis on the old Russian Empire's legacy may overshadow Ukraine's own unique history, culture, and aspirations for self-determination."

Aware of Doroshenko's reputation as a loyal subject, a liberal among nationalists, and a perceived traitor by the Dyrektoria, the Hetman sees an opportunity to build a strong coalition by reconciling with him.\n\nIn a carefully orchestrated meeting, Hetman Skoropadskyi reaches out to Doroshenko, emphasizing the need for unity and collaboration within the Hetmanist movement. Recognizing Doroshenko's experience and influence among the national democratic forces, the Hetman expresses his desire to forge a partnership that encompasses their shared goals while accommodating the diverse perspectives within their respective circles.\n\nDuring their discussions, both leaders acknowledge the ideological differences that exist but agree on the significance of finding common ground to work towards a stronger and more prosperous Ukraine. Understanding the value of compromise, the Hetman and Doroshenko engage in a process of making concessions that can foster a productive coalition.\n\nDoroshenko acknowledges the Hetman's commitment to Ukrainian statehood and his efforts to build a stable government. In return, he seeks assurances that the Hetmanate will uphold democratic principles, respect individual freedoms, and promote greater citizen participation in decision-making processes. This concession demonstrates Doroshenko's desire to implement his democratic ideals without contradicting the Hetman's interests."

This concession not only demonstrates the Hetman's willingness to accommodate differing perspectives but also leverages Doroshenko's expertise and influence within the Hetmanist movement.\n\nThe meeting between Hetman Skoropadskyi and Dmytro Doroshenko marks a significant milestone in the Hetman's endeavor to unite and lead the Hetmanist movement. Their willingness to engage in dialogue, make concessions, and find common ground sets a positive example for their respective followers and the broader Ukrainian political landscape. The news of the reconciliation and the concessions made by both leaders generates a sense of optimism among Hetmanist supporters. The prospect of a united front under the Hetman's leadership, with the inclusion of Doroshenko and his democratic ideals, instills hope for a more inclusive and progressive Hetmanate. As the meeting concludes, both Hetman Skoropadskyi and Dmytro Doroshenko pledge to work together to strengthen the Hetmanist movement and advance the interests of Ukraine. They express their shared commitment to upholding Ukrainian statehood, preserving national heritage, and fostering a prosperous future for the nation.\n\nThe Hetman and Doroshenko, along with their respective supporters, embark on a new chapter of cooperation and collaboration, united in their vision to build a strong and prosperous Ukraine under the banner of the Hetmanist movement."

Understanding the UPSF(m)'s commitment to democratic principles and its desire to bring about a more socially just society, the Hetman finds common ground with Doroshenko and his party. Furthermore, the Hetman recognizes the influence and support of Serhiy Shemet's faction within the USKhD. Acknowledging the pragmatic and realistic approach proposed by Shemet's faction, the Hetman recognizes the value of their involvement in shaping the future of the Hetmanate. In a series of negotiations and discussions, the Hetman, Doroshenko, and Shemet agree to unite their respective movements under a single party. They christen this newly formed political entity as the Ukrainian Democratic-Agrarian Party, or UDKhP, symbolizing a certain return of the Hetmanate to a more democratic framework.\n\nThe decision to unite the Hetmanist movements under the UDKhP is met with both excitement and skepticism. Supporters view it as a significant step towards a more representative government, where the voices of various factions can be heard and considered. However, the decision also raises concerns among some members of the USKhD, including its leader, Lypynskyi. While recognizing the potential benefits of joining forces with the UPSF(m) and Doroshenko, the Lypynskyi questions the compatibility of their ideologies and express concerns about diluting the core principles of Ukrainian conservatism within the Hetmanist movement.\n\nThe unification of the Hetmanist movements under the UDKhP represents a significant shift in the political landscape of the Hetmanate. It marks a departure from the previous autocratic tendencies and a move towards a more participatory and democratic system, albeit with limitations."

The new Constitution was meticulously crafted to strike a delicate balance between stability and progress, preserving the cherished traditions of Ukrainian heritage while embracing the need for modern governance. It showcased a remarkable synthesis of Ukrainian values and contemporary ideals, catering to the evolving needs of the nation.\n\nThe document incorporated a range of provisions aimed at fostering economic growth, promoting social welfare, and safeguarding the rights and freedoms of every Ukrainian citizen. The significance of the new Constitution extended beyond mere legalities. It symbolized a renewed sense of purpose and direction for the Ukrainian people. They viewed it as a unifying force that would guide them towards a harmonious, organic society.\n\nThe parade held to celebrate the occasion was a resounding success, showcasing the unity and collective spirit that had come to define the Ukrainian State.

ukrpol.147.d2: "In a momentous event, Hetman Skoropadskyi, in close collaboration with Viacheslav Lypynskyi and the Ukrainian Party of Agrarian-Statists, proudly announced the adoption of the new Constitution. The event marked a significant shift towards a highly hierarchical and elitist system, with the USKhD assuming a dominant role in shaping the [UKR.GetName]. The atmosphere surrounding the adoption of the new Constitution was filled with a sense of purpose and the pursuit of a national order. Hetman Skoropadskyi, guided by Viacheslav Lypynskyi and the USKhD, crafted a constitutional framework that emphasized a hierarchical structure and celebrated Ukrainian identity.\n\nAddressing the nation, Hetman Skoropadskyi spoke passionately about the importance of embracing a new order. The \"[GetMonth]\" Constitution consolidated power in the hands of the USKhD, elevating them to a position of paramount influence and authority. This marked a departure from the previous democratic elements, shifting towards a mostly one-party state without a parliament. The new Constitution embodied the principles of Ukrainian Conservatism and emphasized the importance of unity and national identity. It promoted a vision of society that placed significant emphasis on the role of the USKhD in shaping the destiny of the Ukrainian statehood. The hierarchical structure of the Constitution reinforced the notion of an elitist ruling class entrusted with governing the nation.\n\nAs the Ukrainian people witnessed the adoption of the new Constitution, there was a mix of anticipation and concern. Some viewed the nature of the system as a means to achieve stability and unity, while others lamented the erosion of democratic institutions and the limited space for political voices.

The atmosphere surrounding the adoption of the new Constitution was filled with a sense of optimism and a shared vision for a more inclusive and participatory government. Hetman Skoropadskyi, together with Doroshenko and Shemet, drew inspiration from various sources, including the governance structure of the German Empire, to craft a constitutional framework that balanced the Hetman's authority with the restoration of democratic institutions. Addressing the nation, Hetman Skoropadskyi emphasized the importance of limiting his own powers and restoring the Soim as a representative body of the Ukrainian people. The new Constitution sought to strike a delicate balance between the Hetman's greater authority and the need for democratic checks and balances. The collaboration between Hetman Skoropadskyi, Doroshenko, and Shemet was evident in the provisions of the new Constitution. The restoration of the Soim allowed for broader political representation and participation, giving a voice to various factions within the UDKhP and beyond. The constitution incorporated elements of decentralization and devolved powers to local communities, fostering greater regional autonomy and decision-making. Drawing from the German Empire's model, the new Constitution introduced a system of governance that combined elements of monarchy with a representative body. This hybrid approach sought to establish a strong executive figure in the Hetman while ensuring the participation of elected representatives in the decision-making process.\n\nAs the Ukrainian people witnessed the adoption of the new Constitution, there was a sense of cautious optimism. The restoration of the Soim and the limitations placed on the Hetman's powers were seen as significant steps towards a more balanced and inclusive system of governance."

Administratively, the Cossack State adopted a system inspired by the historical Cossack divisions, reflecting a decentralized structure that allowed for efficient local governance. The principles of self-governance and autonomy were embraced, enabling communities to participate actively in decision-making processes. Culturally, the Hetmanate embarked on a mission to revive and celebrate Cossack traditions, values, and customs. The Cossack way of life, with its emphasis on honor, bravery, and loyalty, became the guiding force behind the nation's cultural resurgence. The Cossack ethos permeated various aspects of society, from education to arts and literature, creating a strong sense of identity and unity among the people.\n\nThe Cossacks, as true sons and daughters of Ukraine, were entrusted with key positions of authority and responsibility within the new state.

In his opening remarks, Poltavets-Ostrianytsia emphasized the importance of unity among the Cossacks and their pivotal role in upholding the traditions and values of the Hetmanate. He spoke passionately about the need for a representative body that would give voice to the Cossacks and ensure their active participation in shaping the future of the Ukrainian state. Poltavets-Ostrianytsia outlined his vision for the General Cossack Rada, envisioning it as a forum for deliberation, legislation, and decision-making. He emphasized the importance of upholding Cossack traditions and the preservation of the Hetmanate's cultural heritage. The assembly would serve as a platform for fostering solidarity among the Cossacks and strengthening the bond between the Hetmanate and its people."

ukrpol.633.t: "Establishment of the All-Ukrainian Cossack Movement"
ukrpol.633.d: "The Otaman-Minister has announced the establishment of an official All-Ukrainian Movement of Cossacks (Vseukrainskyi Narodnyi Kozatskyi Rukh), with fervent conviction, he addressed the General Cossack Rada, outlining his stance on the Cossack Class and articulating the principles that would guide this new movement. In his proclamation, Ostrianytsia underscored the paramount importance of nationalism as the driving force behind the Ukrainian State. He emphasized that personal desires should be set aside in favor of the greater cause, placing the preservation and defense of the nation at the forefront of their mission. The Cossacks, he declared, were to be the vanguard of this self-defense, embodying the values and traditions that epitomized the Ukrainian spirit.\n\nCentral to the ideology of the All-Ukrainian Cossack Movement was the notion of dexterity in navigating the complex landscape of modern diplomacy. Ostrianytsia recognized that the tactics of the day favored a form of strong leadership, what he referred to as \"dictatorship\", to effectively counter external pressures and ensure the dominance of the ruling SHD party. He believed that by consolidating power under the Hetmanate, they could safeguard the Ukrainian State from internal strife and external threats.\n\nThe movement's charter, guided by Ostrianytsia's vision, contained provisions that granted privileges to those of Cossack descent, regardless of religion, emphasizing their central role in the governance and defense of the Ukrainian State. And only a Ukrainian by blood could be a Cossack. The charter also contained discriminatory clauses that restricted the rights of representatives from other nations, foreigners, and Jews, depriving them of participation in the management of the Ukrainian State, while consolidating the Cossacks as the guardians of Ukrainian nationalism."

ukrpol.634.t: "Militarization of the Bureacracy"
ukrpol.634.d: "Recognizing the military virtues of the Cossacks, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia proposed a reorganization of the bureaucratic apparatus, replacing civilian officials with members of the Cossack class who demonstrated not only administrative skills but also a deep commitment to duty, honor, and the collective interests of the Ukrainian State. This transition aimed to instill a sense of discipline, integrity, and selflessness within the bureaucratic ranks. Ostrianytsia believed that the Cossacks, having a long-standing tradition of loyalty and service to the nation, would bring a higher sense of duty and efficiency to the administration. As Cossacks assumed positions of authority within the bureaucracy, they brought their military discipline, accountability, and commitment to the service of the Ukrainian State. Corruption and abuse of power, which had plagued the civilian-led bureaucracy, were challenged by the Cossack officers' unwavering dedication to upholding the principles of fairness, justice, and the greater good. Whether the militarization of the bureaucracy would prove to be a lasting success or face challenges and unintended consequences remained to be seen"
ukrpol.634.a: "Towards strong Ukraine!"

ukrpol.635.t: "Expanding the Magdeburg Rights"
ukrpol.635.d: "Recognizing the centuries-long legacy of the Magdeburg Rights that allowed certain cities in Ukraine to thrive and be independent, the Hetmanate, under the leadership of Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, is to undertake significant steps to preserve and expand these urban autonomies. The Cities' Magdeburg Rights, derived from the medieval charter of the German city of Magdeburg, were historically bestowed upon select cities in Ukraine, including Kyiv, Chernihiv, Starodub, Poltava, and others. These rights granted the cities a certain level of self-governance, economic freedom, and protection from feudal interference. They allowed urban centers to flourish, attracting trade, commerce, and skilled artisans, and stimulating cultural and intellectual growth. Building upon this rich tradition, Ostrianytsia and his administration recognized the need to extend these rights to the younger cities, particularly those in the Southern and South-Eastern regions of Ukraine. These areas, which had witnessed rapid urbanization and economic development, deserved greater urban autonomies to foster their continued growth and prosperity. Through a comprehensive legislative effort, the Ukrainian State passed a landmark decree, officially extending the Magdeburg Rights to the designated cities in these regions. This decision aimed to empower local governments, provide them with the necessary tools for self-governance, and encourage further economic, social, and cultural advancements.\n\n\nThe newly granted urban autonomies bestowed upon these cities included the right to elect their own mayors and local Cossack councils, the ability to establish and enforce their own laws within the framework of the Hetmanate's legal system, and the authority to manage their local economies and resources. However, challenges and debates arose surrounding the boundaries and specific rights granted to the cities, as well as concerns about potential disparities between the regions. Nevertheless, this 'enshrinement' of the Magdeburg Rights marked a significant milestone for the Hetmanate. It demonstrated a commitment to preserving and expanding the long-standing legacy of urban autonomy and development in Ukraine, ensuring that cities across the nation could prosper and contribute to the overall progress of the Ukrainian State."
ukrpol.635.a: "Genuis!"

ukrpol.636.t: "The New Administrative Division"
ukrpol.636.d: "Historically, the Cossack regiments played a pivotal role in the governance and defense of Ukraine. These military units, organized along regional lines, held deep-rooted connections to the land and its people. Ostrianytsia recognized that the dislocation of these Cossack divisions provided a solid foundation for an administrative division that could effectively manage the territories of the Hetmanate. In a momentous event, the Ukrainian State officially implemented the Cossack Administrative Division, marking a departure from the Tsarist legacy and embracing a system that reflected the nation's proud Cossack heritage. The administrative units were now aligned with the dislocation of the revived Cossack regiments, ensuring a close connection between the governing bodies and the local communities they served. Each Cossack regiment became the focal point of an administrative district, responsible for overseeing various aspects of governance, including law enforcement, taxation, infrastructure development, and social services. The Hetmanate recognized that the intimate knowledge and attachment of Cossack leaders to their respective regions would enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of the administrative apparatus.\n\nThe adoption of the Cossack Administrative Division was met with widespread support and enthusiasm among the people of Ukraine. They saw this reform as a symbol of reclaiming their historical legacy and a step towards greater local empowerment and self-governance. The implementation of the new administrative division also aimed to foster a sense of unity and solidarity among the Cossack divisions and their respective communities. Regular meetings and consultations are to be established between the Cossack leaders and the Hetmanate's central administration to ensure effective coordination and cooperation in governance matters. As the Cossack regiments became the cornerstone of the administrative apparatus, Ukraine embarked on a new era of governance, one that harnessed the strength, resilience, and spirit of its Cossack heritage. This reform would play a vital role in shaping the future of the Hetmanate, ensuring a closer alignment between governance and the needs of its diverse and vibrant regions."

ukrpol.637.d: "The UVO, a revolutionary-political formation established in 1920, had emerged as a powerful force in the nationalist movement. Led by the respected military leader Yevhen Konovalets, the UVO espoused the goal of creating a conciliar independent Ukrainian state on ethnic Ukrainian lands and emphasized the need for a strong and assertive Ukraine. Recognizing the UVO's influence and military expertise, the government of the Hetmanate sought to establish fruitful connections with this prominent organization. The alliance was rooted in a shared commitment to defending the Ukrainian state against potential threats and advancing the cause of independence. As Poltavets-Ostrianytsia saw in the UVO a valuable partner with the capabilities to strengthen the nation's defense forces and contribute to the realization of their vision for a sovereign Ukraine, the government engaged in extensive dialogue with Yevhen Konovalets and the UVO leadership. These discussions focused on strategies to enhance the nation's military readiness, establish effective defense structures, and safeguard Ukraine's territorial integrity.\n\nThe collaboration between the Hetmanate and the UVO set the stage for joint efforts in defense, nation-building, and the protection of Ukrainian interests. Together, they would face the challenges ahead and strive to secure a prosperous and sovereign future for the Ukrainian people."

ukrpol.650.t: "Mikhnovskyi’s First Reform"
ukrpol.650.d: "In a bold and decisive move, Otaman-Minister Mykola Mikhnovskyi, known for his unwavering determination and visionary thinking, initiated a transformative reform aimed at reshaping the Ukrainian State. Drawing on his extensive legal expertise and astute understanding of Ukrainian society, Mikhnovskyi set forth a comprehensive plan to address key challenges and lay the foundation for a prosperous future.\n\nThe cornerstone of Mikhnovskyi's first reform was a thorough reorganization of the nation's administrative structure. Recognizing the need for a more efficient and responsive government, he embarked on a mission to streamline bureaucracy and empower local communities. His vision was to establish a system that not only upheld the principles of governance but also served the needs and aspirations of the Ukrainian people.\n\nUnder Mikhnovskyi's leadership, a series of measures were implemented to revamp the administrative apparatus. Central to this reform was the devolution of power to local authorities, allowing for greater autonomy in decision-making and resource allocation. Mikhnovskyi believed that empowering local communities would enable them to address their unique challenges and tap into their full potential.\n\nTo ensure the success of this ambitious reform, Mikhnovskyi also emphasized the importance of meritocracy in the civil service. He advocated for a transparent and rigorous selection process, where individuals would be appointed based on their qualifications, expertise, and dedication to public service. This approach aimed to weed out corruption and nepotism, fostering a culture of professionalism and accountability within the bureaucracy."

ukrpol.651.t: "Mikhnovskyi's Agrarian Reform"
ukrpol.651.d: "In a landmark move that symbolized his deep commitment to social justice and equitable development, Otaman-Minister Mykola Mikhnovskyi spearheaded a comprehensive agrarian reform aimed at empowering the peasantry and ensuring their rightful place in the nation's progress. Recognizing the vital role of rural communities and the importance of private land ownership, Mikhnovskyi's reforms sought to provide support, opportunities, and economic empowerment to the hardworking farmers across the Ukrainian State. With an acute understanding of the challenges faced by the peasantry, Mikhnovskyi championed their right to private ownership of land. He firmly believed that granting peasants the ability to own and cultivate their land would not only foster a sense of dignity and independence but also unlock their potential to contribute significantly to the nation's agricultural sector and overall development.\n\nMikhnovskyi's agrarian reform encompassed several key initiatives. Firstly, he worked tirelessly to ensure that land redistribution was conducted fairly and transparently, aiming to correct historical injustices and promote a more equitable distribution of agricultural resources. In parallel, Mikhnovskyi prioritized investments in rural infrastructure and social services.\n\nMikhnovskyi's agrarian reform garnered widespread support from rural communities, who saw in his initiatives a genuine commitment to their well-being and empowerment. Farmers across the Ukrainian State embraced the opportunity to own land, modernize their practices, and contribute to the nation's economic growth. Mikhnovskyi's recognition of the peasantry as a cornerstone of the nation's progress, coupled with his unwavering commitment to their rights and well-being, solidified his position as a visionary leader dedicated to social justice."

ukrpol.652.d: "In a fiery and impassioned address to the nation, Otaman-Minister Mykola Mikhnovskyi echoed the tenets of the 10 Commandments of the Ukrainian People's Party, his early organization. He resolutely proclaimed that Ukraine must remain united, undivided, independent, and free, extending its sovereignty from the Carpathian Mountains to the Caucasus. With fervent nationalist fervor, Mikhnovskyi declared that the current borders of Ukraine were mere remnants of its true potential. He argued that the Ukrainian nation's destiny and rightful territorial claim stretched from the western reaches of the Carpathians to the eastern expanses of the Caucasus. Driven by a deep sense of Ukrainian identity and a desire to restore what he perceived as historical injustices, Mikhnovskyi called for a war of territorial conquest. He rallied the people, exhorting them to embrace their warrior spirit and fight for the final unification of all Ukrainian lands under a single banner.\n\n\nIn his vision, Mikhnovskyi saw Ukraine as a powerful and expansive nation, extending its reach across vast territories and uniting all ethnic Ukrainians in a grand and unified state. He argued that by reclaiming these ancestral lands, Ukraine would fulfill its historical and cultural destiny, solidifying its place among the great nations of the world. Mikhnovskyi's administration announced a path of militarization, investing significant resources in the expansion and modernization of the armed forces."

ukrpol.653.d: "Under the leadership of Mykola Mikhnovskyi, Ukraine has introduced a controversial forced resettlement policy. The primary targets of this policy are Jews, Russophones, and individuals identifying as ethnic Russians and Poles. Security forces have been mobilized to enforce the policy, resulting in the mass deportation and eviction of targeted populations from their current areas of residence. Families are being separated, and individuals are being uprooted and relocated to unfamiliar territories within Ukraine. The forced resettlement policy includes the confiscation of assets, land, and properties belonging to the displaced individuals, with the intention of redistributing them among the Ukrainian population. Cultural assimilation is a key component of the policy, with non-Ukrainian communities facing pressure to abandon their native languages, traditions, and cultural practices. The government promotes Ukrainian language and culture as the dominant identity, seeking to create a homogeneous society."

Resistance movements and uprisings have emerged as a direct response to the policy, leading to a significant increase in social tension and armed conflicts throughout the country. Communities targeted by the resettlement policy, including Jews, Russophones, and individuals identifying as ethnic Russians and Poles, have organized themselves to resist the government's actions. They refuse to be uprooted from their homes and are determined to protect their rights and preserve their cultural identities. Resistance movements have taken various forms, ranging from peaceful protests and civil disobedience to more militant actions. As frustrations and grievances grow, some factions within the affected communities have resorted to armed resistance, engaging in clashes with security forces and paramilitary groups.\nThe armed conflicts have further exacerbated the already volatile situation in Ukraine. Both sides, the government forces and the resistance fighters, are locked in a cycle of violence, resulting in casualties and widespread destruction. The clashes have also spilled over into neighboring regions, destabilizing the overall security situation.\n\nThe government has responded to the unrest with a heavy-handed approach, deploying additional security forces and imposing strict control measures in the affected areas. Martial law has been declared in some regions, granting the authorities broader powers to suppress dissent."

ukrpol.655.t: "Property Confiscation and Redistribution"
ukrpol.655.d: "In a controversial move, the Ukrainian government under Mikhnovskyi's administration has implemented a policy of property confiscation, targeting the assets and belongings of displaced individuals affected by the forced resettlement. This policy aims to redistribute the seized properties and assets among the Ukrainian population, with the intent of promoting economic equality and ensuring the welfare of the nation. Under this policy, properties, including land, houses, businesses, and other assets, belonging to individuals who have been forcibly displaced are subject to confiscation by the government. The properties are then placed under state control and managed by relevant authorities. The confiscated properties and assets are subsequently redistributed among the Ukrainian population through various mechanisms. The government establishes programs to allocate the seized land and properties to those in need, prioritizing individuals who have actively participated in the resettlement process or who have been affected by the policy in other ways. The redistribution process aims to promote social equity and address historical inequalities in land ownership and resource distribution. The government endeavors to ensure that the redistributed properties and assets contribute to the overall well-being and development of the Ukrainian population.\n\nDisplaced individuals and their supporters protest against the confiscation, perceiving it as an unjust and arbitrary act that further exacerbates their already dire circumstances. These protests often lead to clashes with law enforcement and further social unrest, adding to the already tense situation in the country. As the property confiscation policy unfolds, its long-term implications and impact on social cohesion, economic stability, and the overall well-being of the Ukrainian people remain subjects of intense debate and scrutiny. The government faces significant challenges in implementing the policy while maintaining social harmony and upholding individual rights."

ukrpol.656.t: "Cultural Assimilation"
ukrpol.656.d: "Under Mikhnovskyi's administration, a policy of cultural assimilation has been implemented, targeting non-Ukrainian populations residing within Ukraine. The government seeks to exert intense pressure on individuals belonging to these communities to abandon their native languages, traditions, and cultural practices in favor of assimilation into Ukrainian society. Non-Ukrainians, including ethnic minorities and linguistic communities, are confronted with a series of measures aimed at promoting Ukrainian language and culture as the dominant and unifying force within the country. The policy encourages the adoption of the Ukrainian language as the primary means of communication and discourages the use of other languages in public spaces, educational institutions, and official settings. To enforce this assimilationist agenda, the government institutes a range of measures, such as restrictive language policies, limitations on cultural expressions, and the discouragement or prohibition of non-Ukrainian cultural activities. These measures include the imposition of fines or penalties for the use of non-Ukrainian languages in public discourse, the removal of bilingual signage, and the reduction or elimination of funding for cultural programs that promote non-Ukrainian identities. Furthermore, educational institutions are required to prioritize the teaching of the Ukrainian language and history, while minimizing or neglecting the study of other languages and cultural traditions. Non-Ukrainian languages may be marginalized or excluded from school curricula, limiting opportunities for future generations to maintain their linguistic and cultural heritage.\n\nThe policy of cultural assimilation generates significant resistance and discontent among affected communities. Cultural, linguistic, and ethnic minority groups, as well as individuals who identify strongly with non-Ukrainian identities, express their frustration and opposition to these measures. Protests, demonstrations, and civil disobedience become common as a means of asserting the right to preserve and celebrate their cultural heritage. As the policy of cultural assimilation unfolds, its consequences for social harmony, cultural diversity, and individual freedoms remain subjects of ongoing debate and concern. The tension between the aspirations of a unified Ukrainian identity and the rights of non-Ukrainian communities poses significant challenges for the government in balancing the preservation of national unity with the recognition of cultural and linguistic rights."

However, the decision to include Butenko in the government proves to be highly controversial and receives widespread criticism from both government officials and the general populace. The appointment of Butenko is viewed as an ill-advised and misguided attempt to align the Ukrainian Hetmanate with Russia, a move that many government officials and the people vehemently oppose. The Russophile faction, with its strong pro-Russian sentiments, is seen as a threat to Ukraine's independence and national identity, stirring concerns among those who prioritize Ukrainian sovereignty and self-determination.\n\nWithin the government, there is a growing sense of unease and disagreement over the decision to appoint Butenko. Officials who advocate for a more independent and nationally focused approach express their frustration and disappointment. They believe that aligning with the Russophile faction and Russia will undermine Ukraine's autonomy and compromise its long-term interests. Similarly, the general public, already wary of Russian influence, expresses widespread discontent with the appointment. Many view it as a betrayal of Ukrainian aspirations for self-governance and see the Russophile faction as an obstacle to Ukraine's progress and development as an independent nation. Concerns are raised about the implications of closer ties with Russia, given its history of interference and aggression towards Ukraine.\n\nOpposition to Butenko's appointment also extends to civil society organizations and political movements that advocate for a more nationally oriented vision of the Hetmanate. They perceive the Russophile faction's influence as a threat to Ukraine's cultural diversity.\n\nAs the backlash intensifies, Hetman Skoropadskyi faces mounting pressure to reconsider the appointment and address the grievances of the people.

The nephew of Vasyl, Leo Stefan Habsburg and Danylo Skoropadskyi, son of the deposed Hetman, are both contenders for the throne. Most of the USKhD members support Danylo as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties.

Most of the UPSS, including Oleksandr Shapoval, would likely support Danylo, despite their opinion of the Hetman, as they believe he will weaken Ukrainian dependence on the Reichspakt by virtue of his lack of royal ties with the European dynasties. Leo Stefan is not really supported by the other half: instead general Hrekiv is likely to oppose any sort of foreign monarchy in Ukraine or even monarchy itself. In this case, however, he'd likely to support Danylo Skoropadskyi. Finally, Petro Bolbochan is a staunch supporter of King Vasyl since he first met him, but really he is not very fond of somebody other becoming Ukrainian sovereign.

ukrpol.160.d: "[GetUKRTitle] Vasyl played an important role in the Brest negotiations that preceded the conclusion of this Treaty. \nHe was one of those few politicians who were aware of the secret annex to the treaty, where Austria-Hungary not only agreed to recognize an independent Ukrainian state, but also to divide Galicia into Ukrainian and Polish parts. \nThanks to William’s personal contacts with the Austrian foreign minister, count Czernin, it was agreed that the Ukrainian part of Galicia would also include the Holm land and that all these lands would form a separate crown land within the empire.\nThese plans, however, could not be realized.\n\nHowever, Vasyl never forgot these agreements. Despite the fact that Count Czernin is no longer alive, the he decided to restore the arrangements and demanded the Eastern Galicia for Ukraine."
ukrpol.160.a: "They should join our alliance if they want Eastern Galicia!"
ukrpol.160.b: "Propose a neutral buffer state of West Ukraine."
ukrpol.160.c: "Just no."

ukrpol.161.t: "Austrian-Ukrainian Convention"
ukrpol.161.d: "The Austrian government has tentatively agreed, but they have demanded that we should formally join their alliance in return."
ukrpol.161.a: "That is not possible."
ukrpol.161.b: "It seems we have no other choice."

ukrpol.162.d: "The Austrian government has tentatively agreed, but instead they suggested that a neutral buffer state of West Ukraine should be created in Eastern Galicia and Volhynia for at least 2 years to exist as an independent nation. The fate of the country shall be after that decided by a special Constituent Assembly to be held in this regions."

ukrpol.163.t: "Austria Refused!"
ukrpol.163.d: "The Austrian government has refused Vasyl’s offer, stating that the territory of the Austrian Empire is not up to debate for the foreign nations."
ukrpol.163.a: "How rude!"

ukrpol.164.t: "Ukraine Agreed!"
ukrpol.164.d: "The Ukrainian government has agreed to join our faction. The necessary agreements have been signed and ratified by both our governments and now the 'Tarnopil Agreements' will lead both of our nations into the future."
ukrpol.164.d.buffer: "The Ukrainian government has agreed for the buffer state project we proposed. The necessary agreements have been signed and ratified by both our governments and now the 'Tarnopil Agreements' will lead both of our nations into the future."
ukrpol.164.a: "Splendid!"

ukrpol.165.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
ukrpol.165.d: "The Ukrainian government has refused our suggestions."
ukrpol.165.a: "Obviously, their loss!"

ukrpol.167.t: "Rada Prysiazhnykh"
ukrpol.167.d: "The members of the USKhD initiative group signed the regulations on the order character of the USKhD with a three-stage membership:\n\nAt the highest level are the \"Spivrobitnyky Prysiazhni\" or the Jury, headed by the Rada Prysiazhnykh, or the Jury Council. The Rada Prysiazhnykh also becomes the official name of the Government of Ukraine. At lower levels there will be Diisni and Odnodumtsi, meaning 'the True' and 'Adherents', accordingly.\n\nWhile the new system has been criticized by some, it is up for the USKhD to define terms of how their party is designed."
ukrpol.167.a: "It already looks like some kind of Masonic order"

ukrpol.168.t: "The New Hetman"
ukrpol.168.d: "Now that the USKhD is formally in power, they have begun to implement their reforms. According to Lypynskyi’s conception of Ukrainian conservatism, it is the Hetman who should be the leader of the country, despite being restricted by the Constitution and Parliament. However, by agreement of Austria, Germany, and Ukraine, Vasyl was crowned as king. It is therefore proposed that the Kingdom be immediately renamed Hetmanate, as is the proclamation of Vasyl as Hetman of All Ukraine, and his successor as Hetmanich. \nIn addition, it is proposed that the succession to the throne, and the rights of the heirs of Hetmanich to the throne of Ukraine, be secured by a special law."
ukrpol.168.a: "Towards traditional Ukraine!"
ukrpol.168.b: "We better not anger the Germans and Austrians, let the King keep his title."

ukrpol.169.t: "The Moral Code"
ukrpol.169.d: "With the aim of implementing the monarchical foundations of statehood, the USKhD resolutely rejects the norms of \"party membership, voting, elections and other democratic attributes, since they lead to careerism, demagogy and irresponsibility.\"\n\nAccording to Lypynskyi, the Moral Code of the Hetmanist should form the basis not only of the members of the USKhD, but also of the citizens of Ukraine, without which the functioning of the country is impossible.\n\n\"No one has the right to be called a Hetmanist and to be in the ranks of the Hetmanist, who is a Ukrainian only to spite Muscovites or Poles,\" Lypynskyi said. - \"Wanting with all my soul my own Ukrainian State and understanding the enormous difficulty of obtaining this State is the main sign that distinguishes a Hetmanist from a non–Hetmanist.\""
ukrpol.169.a: "Let us hope this will bolster patriotism!"

ukrpol.170.t: "Restoring the Ukrainian Cossacks"
ukrpol.170.d: "In order to strengthen the national and political development of the Ukrainian State, consolidate historical and state traditions, national culture and the education of chivalrous virtues among the population, the state of the Ukrainian Cossacks is being restored as a national and political factor of Ukrainian statehood.\n\nEvery citizen has the right to belong to the state of the Ukrainian Cossacks. As Lypynskyi stated, \"The Cossacks are a personal dignity that is not inherited.\"\n\nThe Assembly of the Ukrainian Cossacks will soon form its own governing bodies according to the territorial principle, which are subordinate to the Great Cossack Rada under the Hetman. The motto of the Ukrainian Cossacks was as well established: \"God–Hetman–Ukraine!\""
ukrpol.170.a: "God! Hetman! Ukraine!"

ukrpol.171.t: "USKhD Splits!"
ukrpol.171.d: "Due to Zalozetskyi-Sas's more liberal stance in the eyes of the USKhD’s leader, Lypynskyi and overall approval of these actions by the [GetUKRTitle], the announcement of the new royal coalition with the liberal parties has brought much attention and were discussed by Lypynskyi and his closest allies. In their eyes, such circumstances can lead to overall instability in Ukraine, and, therefore, they have publicly discredited Zalozetskyi-Sas and his supporters.\n\nIn the past, the USKhD has once outlived the similar schism with Skoropadskyi leaving the party to form his own - SHD. However, that time, it was Lypynskyi on the 'liberal' side of the split.\n\nNevertheless, the decision of the Party Congress to cancel membership of Zalozetskyi-Sas and his supporters has led to a significant scandal and even a political crisis. While the Prime-Minister has denounced this decision, he has now been working on establishing a new political faction in the [GetUkrainianParliamentFullName], later to be established in a completely new party. Receiving the name of UMP (Ukrainian Monarchist Party), the new governing organisation has already begun the work to establish itself as a separate from the USKhD political entity."
ukrpol.171.a: "The USKhD once again has split."

ukrpol.172.t: "Rumors of [GetUKRTitle] Vasyl's Abdication"
ukrpol.172.d: "Recently rumors have been circulating throughout Kyiv, where the [GetUKRTitle]'s residence is located, that the [GetUKRTitle]'s health has noticeably deteriorated, allegedly spread by servants. Despite the fact that he is not yet very old and is not even 50 years old, the [GetUKRTitle] has become deaf in one ear and has difficulty performing the duties of the [GetUKRTitle]. Because of this, there are rumors that the [GetUKRTitle] intends to abdicate the throne in order to go to Galicia, where he will live away from political intrigue and regain his health. However, whether this is true or not, it is impossible to know for sure, unless the Vasyl's representation makes a statement"
ukrpol.172.a: "The rumors were confirmed."
ukrpol.172.b: "Nonsense! Vasyl has no intention to abdicate!"

ukrpol.173.t: "[GetUKRTitle] Vasyl of Ukraine Abdicates!"
ukrpol.173.d: "Today, the Royal Palace in Kyiv has officially reported that the [GetUKRTitle] of [UKR.GetNameDef], Vasyl, has abdicated in favor of his heir. Main reason reported is that the [GetUKRTitle]'s health has noticeably deteriorated. The next two months Vasyl will spend in Austria, then visit his homeland of Galicia and later return to Ukraine in order to continue his service for the country, though not in the role of the [GetUKRTitle] anymore."
ukrpol.173.a: "The Ukrainian monarchism lives on."

ukrpol.175.t: "Lypynskyi’s Retirement"
ukrpol.175.d: "Shortly after the conclusion of the committee's work on amending the constitution, Viacheslav Lypynskyi officially resigned, due to the fact that a number of decisions taken do not comply with the doctrine of Ukrainian conservatism. Despite the fact that he will no longer be the Otaman Minister of the government, he will remain the leader of the USKhD and will coordinate a number of party structures and organizations. \n\nNow, in the absence of a government leader, some candidates have been nominated, which the party is invited to consider and, in connection with this, to petition the King for the appointment of a new head of government."
ukrpol.175.a: "Volodymyr Zalozetskyi-Sas becomes the new leader!"
ukrpol.175.b: "Serhiy Shemet has been promoted for leadership."

ukrpol.176.t: "Rozprava z Zahravoiu"
ukrpol.176.d: "Dmytro Dontsov has long been one of the enemies of our regime. Since early 1920s, Lypynskyi has been continuously criticizing the Dontsov's integral nationalism doctrine for its brutality and ignorance. While Dontsov initially participated in the creation of the UDKhP, he soon distanced from the Hetmanists. His group Zahrava has been distributing ultranationalist propaganda since then. Today, this pathetic movememnt will end. By the special decree of [ROOT.GetLeader] at the initiative of Lypynskyi, the Zahrava group was banned from participating in any public life, including their publications in any journals."
ukrpol.176.a: "Radicalism of Dontsov has no place in Ukraine."

ukrpol.177.t: "Fate of the SHD"
ukrpol.177.d: "The Union of Hetmanists-Statists has never been a mass organization. It mainly consisted of those closest to the Hetman, and all the years after the secession from the USHD were engaged in strengthening his personal, dictatorial power. In terms of the basic tenets of Khliborobov-Derzhavnikov, these people are not only traitors to the party, they are traitors to the whole country, because they contributed to the fact that Ukraine is still suffering from the consequences of Skoropadskyi's dictatorship.\n\nThis view, however, is disputed by a number of political figures. In particular, they feel some pity for former party members and insist that now that the Hetman has been overthrown and expelled, work must begin to reintegrate former party members and unify the entire Hetman movement."
ukrpol.177.a: "We must work to bring them back into our movement."
ukrpol.177.b: "Ban these Skoropadskyi fans from politics."

ukrpol.178.t: "Constitutional Review Committee"
ukrpol.178.d: "The regime established by Hetman Skoropadskyi was dictatorial, unjust, and tyrannical for Ukraine. Despite a number of concessions that the Hetman made to Ukraine, they were imposed on him by Germany and Austria-Hungary. Now that Hetman has been forced to abdicate his Hetmanship, Ukraine needs constitutional reform.\n\nTherefore, at Lypynskyi’s insistence, a committee was established to review the constitution. It is to consider in the near future the main questions to be changed.\n\nThe decisions made will form the basis of new constitutional amendments and should finally change Ukraine for the better, according to the principles of Agrarian-Statists"
ukrpol.178.a: "Ukraine shall become a better place."

ukrpol.179.t: "Shemet's 'Praktichna Politika'"
ukrpol.179.d: "Serhiy Shemet proposed the implementation of the so-called \"Praktichna Politika\", a fundamentally new and largely ideologically distorted doctrine that consists of a pragmatic and realistic approach to the needs and requirements of Ukrainians, and which will allow us to remain with the people and speak the same language.\n\nIn contrast to Lypynskyi’s doctrine, which proposes the creation of a clear classocratic and hierarchical system, Shemet is interested in engaging broad segments of the population in political activism, although undoubtedly the focus will be on the breadwinners and farmers, that is, the main agrarian class.\n\nAs Shemet himself put it, it is unacceptable to make Lypynskyi a Mohammed, and the USKhD's founding document 'Lysty do brativ-khliborobiv (Epistles to Brothers-Khliborobs)' a Koran. And while the principles of Ukrainian conservatism are important, they should not overshadow common sense and the actual political situation."
ukrpol.179.a: "His words have certain sense."

ukrpol.180.t: "Doroshenko’s Mistsevi UPSF"
ukrpol.180.d: "Dmytro Doroshenko has been a long-lasting ally of both Hetman, King and our party, despite leading his own. While generally he has much more liberal, or to be precise, national-democratic, political preferences, he was always a loyal Hetmanite. However, our ability to negotiate a coalition with him is not guaranteed, as if our previous steps during the Constitutional Review could have brought Doroshenko to the other side of the barricades."
ukrpol.180.a: "He will become a valuable ally."
ukrpol.180.b: "Doroshenko refused alliance!"

ukrpol.181.t: "Interrogation of Serhiy Shemet"
ukrpol.181.d: "The recent decision to liquidate and ban the activities of the SHD could not but affect our party as well, since many of our members were associated with the Hetman. Particular attention was paid to Serhiy Shemet, a longtime associate of Lypynskyi, who remained a member of the party all these years, but he also maintained ties with Skoropadskyi.\n\nSerhiy Shemet was also critical of some party principles: for example, he was rather negative about Lypynskyi’s idealistic ideas and believed that the party needed to become more 'down-to-earth' - and pursue a realistic and pragmatic policy. His ideas served as the basis for the article \"Praktichna Politika\" published a couple of years ago in Lypynskyi’s journal.\n\nNow the question arises whether Shemet should be trusted, or whether his connections with Skoropadskyi would completely discredit him."
ukrpol.181.a: "He is a loyal Lypynskyite!"
ukrpol.181.b: "His ties with Skoropadskyi prove he cannot be trusted."

ukrpol.182.t: "The Ukrainian Democrats-Khliborobs"
ukrpol.182.d: "Founded in May 1917 on the initiative of Serhiy Shemet and other Khliborobs, the Ukrainian Democratic-Agrarian Party (UDKhP) emerged as a counterweight to the Selianska Spilka and All-Russian Union of Landowners. The party was ideologically close to our current party, and got its name on Lypynskyi’s initiative, and was based on his platform of Ukrainian Conservatism.\n\nThat program in the name of Ukraine's independence was inferior to the ideas of monarchism, and was much more democratic than Lypynskyi’s Hetmanist Nationalism - more focused on classocratic principles, which formed the basis of the current USKhD.\n\nOn the initiative of Serhiy Shemet, the party congress raised the question of an ideological return to the principles of the UDKhP - the unification of the entire hetman movement into a single national front for the development of the Ukrainian state and a retreat from the authoritarian principles laid down by Lypynskyi."
ukrpol.182.a: "This was a mistake, we are Classocratic Hetmanists!"
ukrpol.182.b: "Rename the party to highlight our openness to the people!"

ukrpol.183.t: "United Hetmanist Organisation!"
ukrpol.183.d: "Shemet's efforts to create a united national conserative front of the Hetmanists can finally be considered complete. Thanks to his work on the unification of the Hetmanist movement, it can already be stated that all the contradictions that had distinguished the party members have been resolved and a common compromise has been found. \n\nThe Hetmanist organization now represents a powerful coalition that is capable of defending the interests of a broad stratum of the masses, mainly the agrarians, and represents a strong and responsible government."
ukrpol.183.a: "Truly the Hetmanate will live on!"

ukrpol.184.t: "Downfall of the Shemet Cabinet"
ukrpol.184.d: "Shemet's efforts to create a united national conserative front of the Hetmanists were completely unjustified, and largely at the expense of the previous decisions of the party and the Constitutional Committee. The Hetmanist movement remains fragmented and incapable of responding to the challenges of the times, as Shemet himself believes, for which reason he announced his resignation to the [GetUKRTitle].\n\nThe new government, headed by Volodymyr Zalozetskyi-Sas, a longtime supporter of [ROOT.GetName], now has to work amidst a looming political crisis, but it is clear that all tasks will now be focused on the most pressing political and economic issues, rather than uniting the various Hetmanist organizations."
ukrpol.184.a: "The King appoints Zalozetskyi-Sas as the new Otaman-Minister."

ukrpol.185.t: "The Ukrainian Liberal-Democrats"
ukrpol.185.d: "The Ukrainian Liberal-Democrats, the ULD(S-F) took the side of Dyrektoria during its early days. However, they have never been very loyal or similar in views with the majority of the socialist republican opposition. Moreover, they maintained good relations with Doroshenko, leader of the Hetmanite faction of the once united UPSF.\n\nOur recent negotiations with Serhiy Yefremov and Oleksandr Shulhyn, the ULD leaders, have shown that they are willing to cooperate with our regime, which not only gathers our great support from the ULD's electoral base, but also makes our movement stronger overall."
ukrpol.185.a: "Finally, some support from the left!"

ukrpol.186.t: "Allying the Batko of Samostiynist"
ukrpol.186.d: "Mykola Mikhnovskyi is known to be the first politician who openly called for Ukrainian Independence. He promoted terror against the Imperial government in order to achieve this great aim. At the time he was a minority, as the majority of the socialists rejected separatism. His expression and ambitions alienated him from any major party, which left him alone, exiled by the Hetman. However, Mikhnovskyi is a vital man for the new Ukraine we build. With his experience, oratorical capabilities and thoughts we will be able to secure our samostiynist once and for all. We must immediately ally our old friend, which once greatly helped us in building the UDKhP."
ukrpol.186.a: "The first Independentist has joined back."

ukrpol.187.t: "Of Those without a Class"
ukrpol.187.d: "In the recent weeks the chancellery of Otaman-Minister has been flooded with the flurry of petitions, complaints, requests and sometimes even demands mostly originating from the various professional organisations of lawyers, doctors, teachers and other professions deemed non-producing. All-Ukrainian Union of Medical Workers, [202.GetName] Judicial Society, Association of Ukrainian Teachers, Union of Journalists, National Academy of Sciences and many, many others - all demand the same level of representation in the class councils as was given to the agrarian and industrial organisations.\n\nThe situation is tricky. On one hand, these professionals are crucial for the society and the country and many of them surely possess only the genuine desire to serve the nation without any political aspirations. On the other hand, time and time again history has shown us - people without strong roots in the traditional structures of producing classes often lack the sense of responsibility towards the society as a whole and are frequently guided by their own petty ambitions. This is what ultimately doomed the People's Republic in 1917 - too much was decided by lawyers, writers and publicists, while those working the land or ensuring the country's industrial development were left outside of the decision making process.\n\nWe should not repeat this mistake, but perhaps a compromise solution is possible?"
ukrpol.187.a: "We already support these organisations, do we not?"
ukrpol.187.b: "They may play only an advisory role in the class councils."
ukrpol.187.c: "Agree to the demands."

ukrpol.188.t: "Corruption from VSZV and Protofis?"
ukrpol.188.d: "Rumours have been circulated regarding possible interference from VSZV and Protofis in the new USKhD dominated government. According to these rumours, several members of VSZV and Protofis are using their finances and social standing to influence the process of formations and elections to local and regional class councils. The alliance between the USKhD and these lobbying organisations has been quite uneasy from the beginning and many are rather alarmed by this development. We could choose to investigate the matter further, but further rifts between the alliance our government has made with VSZV and Protofis may look bad considering the commitment to the alliance we have made."
ukrpol.188.a: "Investigate the matter further."
ukrpol.188.b: "Come back when you have some REAL evidence."

ukrpol.189.t: "Real Evidence"
ukrpol.189.d: "It seems that the rumours were true; an investigation into VSZV and Protofis has unearthed plenty of evidence pointing to the machinations of unbelievable proportions. Officials tied to the alliance have lobbied local class councils to favour big landowners and industrialists at the cost of poorer farmers and small businessmen in exchange for greater influence in the local and regional administration, leading to many of the most powerful class councils becoming those dominated by the alliance. This, of course, cannot stand, but wholly dismissing VSZV and Protofis would be an unwise choice. We must figure a way to deal with them one way or another."
ukrpol.189.a: "Give them a stern warning to stop."
ukrpol.189.b: "Remove the officials tied to the lobbying."

ukrpol.190.t: "The VSZV And Protofis Scandal"
ukrpol.190.d: "The Agrarians-Statists have been hit with a wave of allegations of corruption. Multiple newspapers have unearthed contacts between the alliance of VSZV and Protofis and local class councils, indirectly painting the government as either incompetent or unwilling to take action. Though the news is out we still have to do something to salvage our reputation..."
ukrpol.190.a: "Quietly dismiss them..."
UKR_remove_protofis_from_event_tt: "The effects of our alliance with VSZV and Protofis are §Rremoved§!."

ukrpol.191.t: "Issues with Class Councils"
ukrpol.191.d: "Our decision to favour the agrarian class over all others has led to some issues. Already for some time the representatives of various industrial associations have been claiming that the arrangement of class councils was too shifted in favour of agricultural organisations. They refuse to see that despite all the successes of industrialisation Ukraine is still a very agrarian country and we can't simply ignore social and economic realities of our state. It's only natural that the agrarian class should take the leading role in the national governance. Still, for the sake of the stability of our country we must address these complaints one way or another."
ukrpol.191.a: "Ignore them."
ukrpol.191.b: "Try to strike a compromise."
ukrpol.191.c: "Use Homzyn's contacts to silence the loudest complainers."

ukrpol.192.t: "Viacheslav Lypynskyi Passes Away"
ukrpol.192.d: "Today, after long illness, Viacheslav Lypynskyi has passed away at the age of 59. A historian, social and political activist, an ideologue of Ukrainian conservatism, and a visionary, will be remembered as an outsanding politician, that changed Ukraine forever. The Hetmanate, built upon the principles of Ukrainian Conservatism, has proven to be a good system for Ukraine, despite being undemocratic and national and class inclusive. The Lypynskyi's efforts will be always remembered by true patriots of Ukraine."
ukrpol.192.d2: "Today, after long illness, our Otaman-Minister, Viacheslav Lypynskyi, has passed away at the age of 59. A historian, social and political activist, an ideologue of Ukrainian conservatism, and a visionary, will be remembered as an outsanding politician, that changed Ukraine forever. The Hetmanate, built upon the principles of Ukrainian Conservatism, has proven to be a good system for Ukraine, despite being undemocratic and national and class inclusive. The Lypynskyi's efforts will be always remembered by true patriots of Ukraine.\n\nThe congress of [ROOT.GetRulingParty] has announced that he will be succeeded by Serhiy Shemet, one of his closest associates, as the nation's new Otaman-Minister."
ukrpol.192.a: "Rest in peace, Viacheslav Kazymyrovych."


### UPSF ###
ukrpol.200.t: "Elevations & Depressions of Socialist-Federalists"
ukrpol.200.d: "In June 1917, the Socialist-Federalist Party appeared on the political arena of the young Ukrainian republic. It paid tribute to the epoch by its name, but was formed from the members of the Ukrainian Democratic-Radical Party and the Association of Ukrainian Progressives, which had passed into the pages of history. The members of the new party belonged to the liberal-democratic intelligentsia, engaged in national-cultural work and were the best professionals in their field among all parties at that time. Rather moderate socialists and supporters of world federalism and a decentralized administrative structure, the SFs were part of the Hetman government, which led to a pronounced split in the party but not in program, but in strategy.\n\nThe era of the Ukrainian Revolution put members of the same party on different sides of the barricades. The Hetman's supporters became known as the USPF (Mistsevi) - under the leadership of Doroshenko they remained in the Hetmanate and participated in all governments. The faction of Yefremov, Nikovskyi and Shulhyn changed their name to Ukrainian Liberal-Democrats and participated in the creation of the Dyrektoria - although cooperation with openly socialist parties was difficult and rather a strategic decision.\n\nDespite the split, the factions maintained cordial relations, and after the Dyrektoria Revolution, Doroshenko's supporters rejoined their confederates, ready to pursue a dream of a liberal-democratic Ukraine."
ukrpol.200.a: "Let us hope that the party grows even stronger."

ukrpol.201.t: "Air of Freedom"
ukrpol.201.d: "Life gradually began to make sense to the ordinary Ukrainian. Plants that had been abandoned during the strikes and anarchy began to produce again, and workers' wages reached pre-crisis levels. The police, on duty in the streets of Ukrainian cities, guard the peace and quiet of our citizens and restore order after the reign of anarchy. Even some of the large landowners and businesses that fled the country after Hetman have returned, following the news of the restoration of private property rights. Ukrainian peasants and peasant farmers, though still feeling the consequences of the agricultural crisis, are calmly cultivating their land, although under the strain of the existing bread monopoly. \n\nUkraine is returning, albeit slowly and timidly, but to the prosperity once promised by the Hetman regime, which condemned everyone to terrible consequences. Now free Ukraine is on the path of true democracy. And although there is much to do and many obstacles to overcome, there is one indispensable feeling, almost imperceptible, but clearly evident, and which most Ukrainians so far, whether afraid or confused, after centuries of oppression and slavery - Freedom. How it permeates the air, the water, the sky, the Ukrainian fields. Freedom is everywhere and in everything, and filling the entire atmosphere, freedom rushes towards its true goal. To keep this feeling, if only for a moment, is the true dream of Ukraine. And hope. The hope that this moment - on the scale of human history, can fill the lives of tens of generations to come."
ukrpol.201.a: "Let us breathe this air of freedom."

ukrpol.202.t: "Mistsevi Faction in the Government?"
ukrpol.202.d: "A significant majority of the votes cast for the ULD helped ensure that the FPU(m) Doroshenko faction, elected as a unified bloc, was able to secure the election. Familiar faces to voters, unlike ULD, helped ensure victory in several major regions, including one of the most conservative, Poltava. Nevertheless, Doroshenko's faction was not represented in the government, while [ROOT.GetLeader] appointed people closer to him to top positions.\n\nNevertheless, given the warm relations with the faction, [ROOT.GetLeader] suggested that its members, namely Doroshenko as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Stebnytskyi as Minister of Internal Affairs, be included in the government. Some, however, do not support appointing ministers from the other wing to such important positions and suggest giving them portfolios in less important ministries instead"
ukrpol.202.a: "Appoint the Mistsevi on key positions."
ukrpol.202.b: "Invite them to less important offices."

ukrpol.203.t: "The ULD Prime-Minister"
ukrpol.203.d: "While Serhiy Yefremov was the acknowledged leader of the ULD(S-F), there are two other candidates for the prime-minister office, suggested at the Party Congress before the elections. "
ukrpol.203.a: "Serhiy Yefremov, one of the Ukrainian journalism creator!"
ukrpol.203.b: "Andriy Nikovskyi, literary critic and linguist."
ukrpol.203.c: "Oleksandr Shulhyn, a talented diplomat and sociologist."

ukrpol.204.t: "Ivan Ohienko's Farewell Address"
ukrpol.204.d: "Ivan Ohienko, Minister of the Interior, was known to many as a deeply religious man. Privat-docent of the department of language and literature at Kyiv University, who studied the history of East Slavonic accent played a significant role in the Ukrainianization of educational institutions in 1917, and from 1918 he became professor of the history of Ukrainian culture at Kyiv Ukrainian University as well as the founder and first rector of Kamyanets-Podilskyi Ukrainian University. While in exile in Galicia, he founded the publishing house \"Ukrainian Autocephalous Church\", actively cooperated with the Uniate Church, and regularly published his works. Ohienko was also the creator of a new scientific discipline, paleotypia, which he understood as a branch of knowledge about books of old print (\"starodruky\").\n\nIn 1937, however, his beloved wife, Dominika Danylivna, passed away, as a result of which the professor and minister turned to faith with renewed vigor. A few days ago Ivan Ohienko gave his farewell address as minister, and today, he resigned and was tonsured into monasticism with the name Ilarion at St. George's Cathedral in Kamyanets-Podilskyi. Hilarion made an appeal to translate the full text of the Bible into Ukrainian, to continue the cause of Ukrainianization of church life, and to preach."

ukrpol.205.d: "Our relationship with the Jewish Labour Bund has always been symbiotic, that said, the leadership of the Bund is afraid of sweeping changes to the existing status quo, changes that we intend to initiate. That said, the younger members of the Bund have grown up during the official political partnership between us and the Bund and as a result, are much more receptive to us and our reforms. So, to gain the support of the Bund, we intend to give our full support and endorsement to these younger moderate members of the Bund, in hopes that they'll gain more influence within the Bund and eventually take it over, ensuring a more friendly Bund as we implement our many reforms."
ukrpol.205.a: "Best of luck to these young moderates!"

ukrpol.206.t: "Moderates take over the Bund"
ukrpol.206.d: "Our gamble has paid off, under the risk of jeopardising our partnership with the Jewish Labour Bund, we endorsed an effort by young moderate members of the Bund to take over the leadership from the Old Guard. These moderates are much more closely aligned to our government and have proven to be more receptive to our ideas of reform. That said, the chaos within the Bund has undermined the work lives of many Jewish workers, though we believe that things should return to normal given enough time."

ukrpol.207.t: "Approaching the Dyrektoria Moderates?"
ukrpol.207.d: "The ruling ULD(S-F) has found itself at a critical crossroads. Having recently won the elections and establishing their place in the government, the party is now faced with a difficult decision regarding its political alignment in parliament.\n\nThe party must decide if they should approach the socialist-minded USDRP (Ukrainian Social-Democrats), their former allies during the days of the Dyrektoria, in order to push for socialist-oriented policies and maintain their ideological commitment. However, concerns arise that collaborating with the USDRP could push the ULD(S-F) towards a more extreme form of socialism and drive away moderate factions within the party.\n\nAlternatively, the ULD(S-F) can turn to the nationalist parties, represented by the UPSS and Mikhnovskyi. Although not far-right, these groups emphasize national identity and have earned some level of respect within the armed forces. By allying with these nationalists, the ULD(S-F) could strike a balance between its socialist aspirations and a more pragmatic coalition that recognizes the importance of national unity.\n\nThe ULD(S-F) leaders gather to discuss these options and determine the fate of the Ukrainian People's Republic. As tension builds within the party and the wider political arena, their crucial decision will shape the future of the nation. Will they choose the socialist path, renewing ties with the USDRP, or forge ahead with a nationalist alliance, bridging the gap between their ideals and the demands of the political landscape? The outcome will play a vital role in defining the course of the Ukrainian People's Republic for years to come."

ukrpol.208.d: "The Ukrainian Liberal Democratic Party (Socialist-Federalists), or ULD(S-F), has made the strategic decision to ally with national-democrats in order to create a balanced and pragmatic coalition. This alliance, however, has led the ruling ULD(S-F) to a crossroads – they must now choose with which key national-democratic faction to partner.\n\nOne option on the table is the UPSS, a politically diverse coalition composed of factions such as Andriyevskyi's national-socialists, Shapoval's conservatives, and various militarists and nationalists. By allying with the UPSS, the ULD(S-F) could reinforce their commitment to the national-democratic cause while attracting broader support from different political opinions.\n\nThe alternative choice is forming a new coalition with the distinguished Mykola Mikhnovskyi. As the trailblazer behind the idea of Ukrainian sovereignty, Mikhnovskyi is a non-partisan whose connections to the UPSS's faction of Mikhnovites run deep. However, his towering ambitions may potentially create strife and instability within such a coalition.\n\nSurprisingly, a third possibility has emerged: creating an alliance with both the UPSS and Mikhnovskyi in an attempt to bridge their differences and unify the national-democratic movement. This decision may not be without its challenges, though, as juggling the distinct ideologies and ambitions of the different factions could prove difficult.\n\nAs the ULD(S-F) weighs these critical options, the future trajectory of Ukrainian politics and unity are at stake. It is up to the ULD(S-F) to forge a coalition that suits their goals and maintains national stability – but which combination of partners will ultimately be the most advantageous remains to be seen."

While all of the most radical USDRP ideas were rejected by the government, the moderate ones were accepted, such as increasing effort in industrialisation of Ukraine, as well as land reform adjustments. With the USDRP's prominent economist, Dmytro Isaievych taking the chair of Economy Minister, there's a chance for a most justful and efficient social welfare programme. While other USDRP members received some of other chairs in the government, the new USDRP-ULD coalition is ready to embark on its political journey in new Ukraine."

ukrpol.210.t: "Leftist Opposition Gets Stronger"
ukrpol.210.d: "The ULD(S-F)'s decision to ally with national-democratic parties has not only created rifts within the ruling coalition, but it has also emboldened the leftist opposition. As news of the ULD(S-F)'s alliances spreads throughout the country, left-wing groups have grown increasingly concerned about the direction of Ukrainian politics.\n\nIn response to what they see as a betrayal of leftist values, members of the UPSR and the USDRP have begun to organize mass protests and rallies. These events have attracted large crowds of disaffected workers and intellectuals, who are frustrated with the lack of representation in the government.\n\nAs the opposition grows stronger, the ULD(S-F) is struggling to maintain control. Some within the party have suggested that the ruling coalition should abandon their alliances with national-democratic factions and return to their roots as a left-wing party. Others, however, argue that the ULD(S-F) must remain pragmatic and work with any party that can help them achieve their goals of stability and prosperity for Ukraine.\n\nThe situation in Ukraine is becoming increasingly volatile, with political tensions and economic hardship driving people into the arms of extremist groups on both the left and right."

ukrpol.211.t: "The Model Parliament"
ukrpol.211.d: "The government has considered a large-scale project to reform the current legislative system, based largely on the outdated understanding of the Skoropadskyi era. In fact, the functions of the puppet \"Soim\" that acted under the Hetman remained the same as those of the Central Rada, acting now, of course, with a few exceptions. Nevertheless, the government is seriously prepared to consider projects to modernize the system and create a new parliament modeled on the European powers.\n\nA total of 3 projects have been submitted to the reform commission for consideration. The first of them is a model parliament on the basis of the Swedish Riksdag. 'Derzhavna Rada' will be bicameral, consisting of a chamber of deputies and a chamber of land assemblies. The upper house will consist of representatives of regions and city councils, elected indirectly.\nThe second option is based on the Swiss Federal Assembly, also a bicameral parliament. The seats in the lower house, the 'Natsionalna Rada', would be allocated in proportion to the population of the regions, and in the 'Rada Zemel' each region would get two mandates, which would ensure equality of voters and regions.\nFinally, the last proposed option is the model of the Dutch Parliament - bicameral, where deputies will be elected to the lower Palata Predstavnykiv in general elections for 5 years, and the upper House - the 'Senat Respubliky', where deputies will be elected for 4 years on the basis of sheets submitted by the regions.\n\nEach model has its own characteristics, but building a new legislative system in line with leading European standards will help us build a stable political system and strengthen the freedoms of citizens."

ukrpol.213.t: "The Debate of a Central European Federation"
ukrpol.213.d: "In a recent meeting, the ULD(S-F) extensively discussed their plans for Ukraine in the context of a Central European Federation. Several approaches have been considered, each met with strong support and criticism from the party members and the populace.\n\nOne proposal entails allying with the Austrian Von Coudenhove-Kalergi's Paneuropa Movement, which envisions a united Europe that ensures continued peace, prosperity, and progress. This option would have the benefit of positioning Ukraine as a vital part of the greater European community. However, there is a growing concern within the party that this movement might be too idealistic to achieve tangible goals.\n\nAnother approach would see Ukraine mend ties with Germany's Mitteleuropa project - an established federation aimed at fostering economic cooperation and political stability in the region. By rekindling their relationship with Germany, the ULD(S-F) could potentially secure continued support and protection within the heart of Europe. However, critics argue that associating with this German-centric federation could result in forfeiting Ukrainian sovereignty to Berlin's agenda.\n\nLastly, there is a considerable faction advocating for the Mizhmoria (Intermarium) concept – an independent alliance of Eastern and Central Europe, free from German and Russian influence. This broad collaboration would provide a counterweight to the Western and Eastern power blocs. Nevertheless, skeptics question the feasibility of effectively coordinating such a diverse, multilingual, and historically divided group of nations, fearing that internal conflicts could undermine the very foundation of the alliance.\n\nThe ULD(S-F) now faces a crucial decision, as it must carefully weigh the potential benefits and risks each approach presents in order to ensure the stability and continued growth of Ukraine amidst the complex European political landscape."

ukrpol.214.d: "In an extraordinary step towards regional cooperation and shared ambitions, the Party of Ukrainian Liberal Democrats (Socialists-Federalists) has taken the initiative to organize the first-ever conference of Federalist parties focused on building stronger ties between Ukraine, Belarus, and Georgia under the Mizhmoria framework.\n\nThe groundbreaking event saw the participation of some of the most influential regional federalist parties, including the ULD(S-F) itself, the Belarussian BPS-F, and the Georgian SSPRP. Each of these parties carries the historical heritage of Socialist-Federalists from the Russian Empire days and has now come together to reaffirm their commitment to federalism and social democracy.\n\nThe key task of the conference was to determine the relations of these parties in the context of uniting the three nations into a powerful and sovereign Mizhmoria alliance and discussing each party's role in achieving this ambitious goal. During the conference, each party presented their proposals for the future of their respective nations and outlined their vision for the functioning and progress of the Mizhmoria alliance.\n\nULD(S-F) emphasized the importance of a united front in pursuing regional unity and offered to bolster support for its fellow parties through various means. The BPS-F revealed its plan for achieving a politically stable and economically resilient Belarus, outlining steps needed to enhance its integration within Mizhmoria. Meanwhile, the SSPRP discussed its strategy for harmonizing Georgia's rich tradition and culture with modernization and progress, making the nation an essential pillar of the alliance.\n\nDespite diverse national contexts, the participating parties concurred on the need for solidarity and cooperation in realizing their shared goals and ensuring the success of the Mizhmoria project. The event concluded with a collaborative pledge to sustain this partnership and organize similar conferences in the future, fostering unity among Federalist parties and working towards a prosperous, sovereign, and democratic Central Europe under the Mizhmoria alliance."

ukrpol.215.t: "The German Minority"
ukrpol.215.d: "The ULD(S-F) are faced with the task of addressing the concerns of the German minority residing in Ukraine. The German diaspora in Ukraine has a rich and diverse history, with significant populations in regions such as Crimea, Volhynia, and other areas. However, recent political tensions and a somewhat hostile environment have left the German minority feeling uncertain and vulnerable. The ULD(S-F) government recognizes the importance of ensuring the safety and well-being of the German community and seeks to implement measures that will make them feel secure and valued within Ukrainian society.\n\nAcknowledging the unique cultural identity of the German minority, the ULD(S-F) government proposes the establishment of German Cultural Autonomy. This initiative aims to grant the German community the freedom to preserve and promote their language, customs, and traditions. It would provide them with a sense of security and cultural preservation, fostering a stronger connection between the German minority and the broader Ukrainian society.\n\nAnother proposal is to address concerns of discrimination and prejudice, the ULD(S-F) government proposes comprehensive anti-discrimination laws that explicitly protect the rights of the German minority. These laws would ensure equal rights, opportunities, and protection against discrimination based on ethnicity. By enacting such legislation, the government aims to create a safe and inclusive environment that values diversity and fosters mutual respect among all Ukrainian citizens.\n\nFinally, recognizing the need for economic empowerment and integration, the ULD(S-F) government proposes targeted economic initiatives and development programs for the German minority. These initiatives aim to create employment opportunities, encourage investment in German communities, and promote economic growth in regions where the German diaspora is concentrated. By fostering economic prosperity, the government aims to enhance the overall well-being and stability of the German minority in Ukraine."

ukrpol.220.d: "The ongoing turbulence in the Kingdom of Ukraine took yet another turn this week as the UPSS failed to come to an agreement with the UVO. Recent efforts by the UPSS to establish a stable and united front have now been thwarted, leaving the political landscape in Ukraine fractured and uncertain.\n\nIt bears mentioning that the UPSS, which initially emerged during the Ukrainian Revolution, has come a long way since its inception as a coalition of right-wing and left-wing politicians. As the movement found itself progressively inclined towards social patriotism and socialism, it adopted a more intellectual and civic form of nationalism. The UPSS leadership, under the reign of the Triumvirate aspires to create equitable opportunities for the Ukrainian population and resume a degree of normalcy.\n\nIn contrast, the UVO inspired by Dmytro Dontsov's doctrine of integral nationalism, firmly believes in the establishment of an independent Ukrainian state on ethnic terms. The organization is also inclined to collaborate with Germany, as they deem the latter to be the primary defender against potential Russian aggression.\n\nThe UPSS has been earnestly trying to strike an alliance with the UVO, given that both parties share the objective of Ukrainian independence. The ongoing negotiations, however, proved that their standpoints on various issues, such as the extent of nationalism, socialism, and foreign alliances, diverged considerably. As the UVO leaders have highlighted the UPSS's recent negotiations with the Dyrektoria, they claimed the Triumvirate to be a bunch of 'crypto-communists', though refusing any further dialogues. Consequently, their failure to reach a consensus has only served to deepen the divide among the politically charged groups of the Kingdom of Ukraine.\n\nThis unfortunate stalemate has raised alarming concerns about the future of the Ukrainian political landscape, as both the UPSS and the UVO continue to diverge in their ideologies. The need for a unified government has never been more pressing. As it stands, the inability of both parties to compromise on key issues has left Ukraine's political unity at significant risk."

ukrpol.221.d: "Negotiations between the UPSS and UVO have finally come to fruition as both parties seek to strengthen the cause of Ukrainian independence and protect the nation from facing foreign domination and internal exploitation once more. As the Triumvirate took power, they recognized the need to secure the allegiance of the nationalist organization of the UVO to bolster their political strength and form a unified force for Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nAfter weeks of intense discussions, the Triumvirate was able to strike an understanding with the UVO leader [GetUVOLeader], by agreeing to work together towards the creation of a conciliar independent Ukrainian state on ethnic Ukrainian lands. They acknowledged the necessity of this alliance for their country to stand strong against potential threats, especially the ever-looming Russian aggression.\n\nDuring these negotiations, the two parties found common ground by focusing on the shared values of social patriotism and civic nationalism. However, they agreed to move away from the more extreme elements of Dmytro Dontsov's integral nationalism embraced by the UVO which could alienate potential allies and pose a risk to their cause. The UPSS also stressed the importance of a deep intellectual and cultural awareness among the nation's youth, inspired by Mikhnovskyi's early writings.\n\nThe Triumvirate further managed to persuade the UVO that cooperation with Germany should only be pursued if it benefits Ukrainian interests and preserves their independence, rather than making them beholden to yet another foreign power. The UVO accepted this position, realizing that they needed to protect the essence of Ukrainian identity and ensure that the prosperity of their homeland would still remain in the hands of Ukrainians.\n\nIn another major concession, the UPSS agreed to back the UVO's demand that serious political reform would become necessary if Ukraine's independence were threatened. This solidified the UVO's trust in their new allies and demonstrated that the passion for an autonomous Ukraine lay at the core of the UPSS's principles.\n\nThis alliance between the UPSS and UVO under the Triumvirate government has now become the bedrock for a stronger, more unified Ukraine. By setting aside their ideological differences and working together towards their shared goals, the two groups have demonstrated that the flame of patriotism and independence burns brighter when minds and hearts unify for the betterment of the nation. Together, they will stand firm against any force that threatens the autonomy and prosperity of the Ukrainian people, and shall not rest until their homeland's future is secure."

The Dyrektoria has been conducting subversive activities against the officially recognized Hetmanate for many years. However, their most significant impact comes from the way they have united the most radical and leftist movements and parties.\n\nThe negotiations between the UPSS and the Dyrektoria were intense, with both parties wary of each other's intentions. However, in a historic move, the UPSS and the Dyrektoria agreed to put their differences aside and work towards a common goal - defeating the German and Austrian influences and restoring the Ukraine's true independence, which meant the eventual restoration of a republic. The UPSS was impressed with the Dyrektoria's commitment to the people's welfare, while the Dyrektoria appreciated the UPSS's strong sense of nationalism.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the Dyrektoria agreed to support the UPSS's government while the UPSS vowed to work with the Dyrektoria towards the establishment of a republic. Both sides agreed to support each other's political goals as long as they do not interfere with the alliance's objectives.\n\nThe UPSS's alliance with the Dyrektoria is a significant move towards the restoration of the Ukraine's sovereignty. It marks a crucial turning point in the country's history, where two seemingly opposite parties have come together to work towards a common goal.

While the procedure was held without any referendums, some people have criticised the King's decision and claimed that he was forced to abdicate by the Ukraine's ruling junta.\nNevertheless, Ukraine is now a republic with [UKR.GetLeader] as its first interim president."
ukrpol.231.d.vasyl: "The recent news has reached us from Kyiv, Ukraine, where the ruling monarch, Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen, better known as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi has abdicated in favour of the republican government. What is more interesting, he was offered a position of interim president, becoming a common man, equal among the others."
ukrpol.231.a: "Has the Ukrainian monarchism ended here?"
ukrpol.231.b: "Another nations throws off shackles of the past."

ukrpol.232.t: "Constitutional Crisis in Ukraine"
ukrpol.232.d: "Ukraine is encountering a wide-scale constitutional crisis, considering the position of the Ukrainian ruling monarch. Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen, better known as King Vasyl Vyshyvanyi has fled the country for Austria, leaving the throne vacant and the govenment has declared the republic. While the representatives of the Austrian royal house claim that there was an anti-monarchist putsch in Kyiv, the official Ukrainian government rejects these allegations, claiming that King was never forced to flee."

ukrpol.233.t: "Anti-Monarchist Putsch in Ukraine"
ukrpol.233.d: "We have several confirmations, both through open and closed channels, that an anti-monarchist putsch initiated by General Hrekiv recently took place in Kyiv, the purpose of which was to overthrow the Austrian reigning dynasty and King Vasyl. Despite this, the official authorities deny this version, insinuating that the King left the country voluntarily and in fact in this way renounced the duty entrusted to him by the Constitution of Ukraine to fulfill his role."
ukrpol.233.a: "Reply firmly: demand restoration of the Habsburg King!" #for AUS
ukrpol.233.b: "Reply temperately: condemn the putsch and pressure their government." #for AUS/GER
ukrpol.233.c: "Express deep concern."
ukrpol.233.e: "Back the new government as long as they are loyal to us" #for GER

ukrpol.234.t: "Bolbochan's Putsch in Kyiv!"
ukrpol.234.d: "It seems that something went wrong in terms of reforms, largely lobbied for by Hrekiv and his supporters from Batkivschyna. This was especially realized when the armed Derzhavna Varta broke into Hrekiv's office and arrested him for treason and attempted coup d'etat.\n\nThe elderly general was led out of his office at gunpoint and Mausers, and then taken to court, where the judge ordered that he be placed in a pre-trial detention center.\n\nAt the same time, the head office of Batkivschyna in Kyiv was being ransacked - HQ staff officer Ivan Andrushchenko and Colonel Borys Khoslovskyi, who was there, were arrested. There were also reports of the arrests of the chairman of the Kharkiv branch of the society, Mytrofan Popsui-Shapka, and of the Melitopil branch, Tryhubiv-Pasynok. \n\nAround the same time, it became clear that General Bolbochan was behind the arrests, who was able to convince the third triumvir, Oleksandr Shapoval, of the illegality of Hrekiv's actions and the inadmissibility of ultimatums. The King had already noted Bolbochan's steadfastness and loyalty to the oath given to him and expressed his confidence that the conflicts would be resolved democratically."
ukrpol.234.a: "End of Hrekiv's folly."

ukrpol.235.t: "Wilhelm Habsburg Joins Our Armed Forces"
ukrpol.235.d: "Forced to leave the Ukrainian throne, where Wilhelm Franz von Habsburg-Lothringen was better known as King Vasyl, now expressed his desire to join our armed forces. The commander of the Ukrainian Sich Riflemen during the Weltkrieg, Wilhelm is not the most talented military leader, but it is possible that he is worthy to serve our country."
ukrpol.235.a: "Your welcome!"
ukrpol.235.b: "Send him to Galicia!"
ukrpol.235.c: "He'd better stay as a civilian figure."

ukrpol.236.t: "Austria Demands Restoration of Vasyl!"
ukrpol.236.d: "The Austrian goverment was outraged by the fact that their Willy von Habsburg was forced to flee the foreign country. However, we actually had not threatened him with anything and it was his choice to leave his throne and escape the country. So, we can do nothing with it."
ukrpol.236.a: "He left the throne without notice, not our problem..."

ukrpol.237.t: "[FROM.GetName] Pressures Our Government!"
ukrpol.237.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has seriously condemned what they call 'putsch' and pressures our government because of Willy von Habsburg fleeing the foreign country. However, we actually have nothing to do with his sudden escape."
ukrpol.237.a: "They have nothing to do with it..."

ukrpol.238.t: "[FROM.GetName] Expressed Deep Concern"
ukrpol.238.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has rather weakly reacted to the member of the Habsburg royal family leaving Ukraine all in a sudden and therefore no longer being the head of Ukrainian state. However, we have nothing to do with his sudden escape."
ukrpol.238.a: "Pathetic..."

ukrpol.239.t: "[FROM.GetName] Supports Our Government"
ukrpol.239.d: "Suddenly, the German government has supported our government and reminded that as part of their alliance, not their colonial subject, we have the right to elect whatever government we can. Therefore, they don't see us as illegitimate government, neither do they accept Vasyl's claims to the throne since he himself escaped the country when 'he was in no danger'."
ukrpol.239.a: "Surprising."

ukrpol.240.t: "Ukraine Left Our Demands Unanswered"
ukrpol.240.d: "The Ukrainian government has simply ignored our rightful demands to re-establish legal order in the country. While we cannot directly attack the ally of the German Empire, we will now have to cope with the new affairs, while definitely that means that Ukraine is no longer considered a reliable partner of us."
ukrpol.240.a: "How dare they!"
ukrpol.240.b: "Establish a Kronland of Eastern Galicia with Vasyl as its head!"

ukrpol.241.t: "The Austrian Response"
ukrpol.241.d: "The Austrians have treacherously established the 'Kronland' in our rightful lands. Having paid no concern to the Ukrainians leaving in their country, they have no all of a sudden established the Crownland of East Galicia with our ex-monarch Vasyl as its head. While they may have outplayed us in this diplomatic warfare, we will certainly have our say by ending our relations with Austria and eventually annexing our rightful Galician lands!"
ukrpol.241.a: "They offered us the right to their land in their own hand!"

ukrpol.242.t: "Seeking Compromise With the Red Prince"
ukrpol.242.d: "Although many believe that King Vasyl was the viceroy of the Germans, this is not entirely true. Vasyl played an important role in the Ukrainian Revolution, where he took an active part in the command of some groups of troops, in particular through which he developed close contacts with General Bolbochan, who became his staunch supporter. Nevertheless, the question of Vasyl's coronation as Sovereign of Ukraine was not resolved until 1927, when under the Austro-German Compromise, Ukraine became a kingdom headed by Vasyl. \n\nDespite his largely symbolic role, Vasyl tried to take an active part in politics: in particular, with his direct support, there existed parties in opposition to Hetman, including the UPSS. \n\nNevertheless, a compromise must be found with the \"Red Prince\" and his non-interference in Ukrainian affairs for as long as he is on the throne must be ensured. His responsibilities should be strictly limited and his influence on politics minimal. The main proponent of such a solution is General Bolbochan, who resists the opinion of other party members to abolish the monarchy.\n\nIt seems that the decision has been made, and now it is just a matter of approving the status quo and negotiating with the king."
ukrpol.242.a: "Ukraine shall remain a monarchy."

ukrpol.243.t: "Hrekiv's Putsch in Kyiv!"
ukrpol.243.d: "It seems that something went wrong in terms of reforms, largely lobbied for by Hrekiv and his supporters from Batkivschyna. This was especially realized when the armed Derzhavna Varta broke into Hrekiv's office and arrested him for treason and attempted coup d'etat.\n\nThe elderly general was led out of his office at gunpoint and Mausers, and then taken to court, where the judge ordered that he be placed in a pre-trial detention center.\n\nAt the same time, the head office of Batkivschyna in Kyiv was being ransacked - HQ staff officer Ivan Andrushchenko and Colonel Borys Khoslovskyi, who was there, were arrested. There were also reports of the arrests of the chairman of the Kharkiv branch of the society, Mytrofan Popsui-Shapka, and of the Melitopil branch, Tryhubiv-Pasynok. \n\nAround the same time, it became clear that General Bolbochan was behind the arrests, who was able to convince the third triumvir, Oleksandr Shapoval, of the illegality of Hrekiv's actions and the inadmissibility of ultimatums. The King had already noted Bolbochan's steadfastness and loyalty to the oath given to him and expressed his confidence that the conflicts would be resolved democratically."
ukrpol.243.a: "End of Bolbochan's folly."

ukrpol.244.t: "Crisis In The Triumvirate"
ukrpol.244.d: "The triumvirate that has been in place for several months has largely held on to its common goal of preserving stability within the country and preventing the collapse of Ukrainian statehood. At least that is what the official representatives said.\n\nBut by now it has become clear that different ideological platforms, political ambitions, etc. have contributed to the fact that the Triumvirate is bursting at the seams.\n\nSoon there were rumors that the Triumvirate was going to lift the state of emergency and elect a new legitimate government. However, it is not yet known who will lead this government."
ukrpol.244.a: "The Triumvirate shall end its duty in a week."

ukrpol.245.t: "The King Appoints Bolbochan"
ukrpol.245.d: "A couple of days ago it was revealed that the Triumvirate had officially ended its existence largely due to controversy within it. The main intrigue for Ukrainians, however, was who would lead the new government.\n\nToday, however, it has become known that the King has appointed a new Otaman-Minister, or head of government, in the person of General Petro Bolbochan. An ardent associate of Vasyl, Bolbochan has built his career in independent Ukraine on the support of royalty and has contributed greatly to the support of Vyshyvanyi among the UPSS.\nNow, apparently, the king repaid Bolbochan in full, and instructed him to form and lead a new government, after which to restore democratic processes within the country."
ukrpol.245.a: "Glory to the King and Petro Bolbochan!"

ukrpol.246.t: "The Triumvirate Dissolves, Elections In A Year"
ukrpol.246.d: "A couple of days ago it was revealed that the Triumvirate had officially ended its existence largely due to controversy within it. The main intrigue for Ukrainians, however, was who would lead the new government.\n\nAlready today it became known that the Triumvirate was officially dissolved and Oleksandr Shapoval, a representative of the conservative trend within the UPSS, was reappointed as the formal head of government. However, his candidacy is not final. \n\nIn the near future, the UPSS should meet at a party congress and finally confirm its ideological platform. In the event that the positions of the right-wing socialists within the party prevail, it is likely that the congress will elect a more leftist leader - Opanas Andriyevskyi"
ukrpol.246.a: "Democracy is returning back to Ukraine."

ukrpol.247.t: "General Hrekiv Overthrows the Triumvirate"
ukrpol.247.d: "A couple of days ago it was revealed that the Triumvirate had officially ended its existence largely due to controversy within it. The main intrigue for Ukrainians, however, was who would lead the new government.\n\nToday, however, the Ukrainian capital woke up to the sound of gunfire. Officers from the Batkivshchyna comradeship, led by General Hrekiv, arrested what was left of the Triumvirate. The justification for this action was personal accusations by Oleksandr Shapoval of trying to re-establish ties with the Hetman movement and return the Skoropadskyis, represented by Hetmanych Danylo, to the Ukrainian throne. Although these accusations have some justification, on the whole, what happened is unequivocally characterized as a coup d'état.\n\nGeneral Hrekiv, now in charge of the country, promises social justice and equality, as well as the strengthening of the country's defense in the name of its sovereignty. So far, the newspapers have not been very positive, but who knows, maybe a Hrekiv's firm hand will put an end to the instability in Ukrainian politics?"
ukrpol.247.a: "At least we can hope Ukraine will be much more stable now."

ukrpol.248.t: "Dyrektoria’s Popular Front Established"
ukrpol.248.d: "In response to the unification of conservative movements, like ours and the USKhD, the legalised Dyrektoria opposition has grown even stronger, initiating a large anti-governmental campaign with socialist slogans and strikes. The newly established 'Popular Front' is now trying to achieve full power in Ukraine through local elections. We should effectively resist their agitation, perhaps even increasing our funding for Derzhavna Varta."
ukrpol.248.a: "They once again try to "

ukrpol.249.t: "The UPSS [GetYear] Congress"
ukrpol.249.d: "The congress of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Independentists was held today to adopt a new program of the party, the first since 1920. The main contradictions consist of a misunderstanding of the path the party should take in the future. \n\nA number of supporters of the socialist platform argue that Ukraine should go the socialist way, as the party name implies, while they do not lose sight of the national-patriotic ideology. Supporters of this platform are united around one of the party's leaders, Opanas Andriyevskyi.\n\nOn the other hand, they are opposed by supporters of the conservative platform, who stand on a rigid anti-socialist platform close to the positions of Mikhnovskyi and Lypynskyi, that is, the Hetman movement. Their leader, Oleksandr Shapoval, also has a great chance of success in becoming the official leader of the party."
ukrpol.249.a: "The party has adopted the socialist platform."
ukrpol.249.b: "The party has adopted the conservative platform."

ukrpol.251.t: "Party Inside the Party"
ukrpol.251.d: "An interesting case in the UPSS is that it is a federalised party, consisting another party inside it. The Ukrainian People's Party, or the UNP, was one of the founders of the UPSS in 1917 and as agreed, it joined UPSS in a union, preserving its autonomy and separate membership until this day.\n\nThis broad coalition of mostly socialist-minded politicians, greatly inspired by the Mikhnovite nationalist thought became the main stronghold of the leftist bias in our party. Their dedication to our common fight was always a source of pride for our great party. They are clearly our best cadres, politicians who fought for Ukrainian independence for almost 40 years, and we must award them for their loyalty and service." 
ukrpol.251.a: "Our best cadres!"
ukrpol.251.b: "Bring back the old name!"

ukrpol.252.t: "Shapoval's Supporters Join the USKhD"
ukrpol.252.d: "Since the adoption of the new party platform, the conservative members, including Oleksandr Shapoval were in opposition. However, today it became clear that they have stroke a deal with Lypynskyi and the USKhD and have joined their party. Now, USKhD as one of the main oppositional parties has grown stronger. On the other hand, our own party is much more homogeneous now."
ukrpol.252.a: "The Hetmanist movement grows stronger..."

ukrpol.253.t: "Allying the 'Father of Sovereignty'"
ukrpol.253.d: "Mykola Mikhnovskyi is known to be the first politician who openly called for Ukrainian Independence. He promoted terror against the Imperial government in order to achieve this great aim. At the time he was a minority, as the majority of the socialists rejected separatism. His expression and ambitions alienated him from any major party, which left him alone, exiled by the Hetman. However, Mikhnovskyi is a vital man for the new Ukraine we build. With his experience, oratorical capabilities and thoughts we will be able to secure our samostiynist once and for all. We must immediately ally our old friend, which once greatly helped us in building the party.\n\nThe Mikhnovite faction in the UPSS is welcoming their once leader, whose name they bear to lead their faction and help in the great aim of nation-building."
ukrpol.253.a: "We are glad that Mikhnovskyi finally reunited with his party!"

ukrpol.254.t: "Ideologists of 'Samostiynist'"
ukrpol.254.d: "When Mikhnovskyi first published his manifesto, he was not alone - in fact, he had loyal supporters both in then-his UNP party, as well as other non-partisan politicians. That type of nationalism, that Mikhnovskyi promoted, was generally civic nationalism, aimed to build a strong and united Ukraine.\n\nBy no doubt, the Mikhnovite nationalism is the key to Ukrainian survival, and based on his ideas, our nationalist bloc successfully operated until now."
ukrpol.254.a: "The Mikhnovite nationalism is the key to Ukrainian survival."

ukrpol.255.t: "Hetmanist Movement"
ukrpol.255.d: "The Hetmanist movement was rather close to us. Represented mainly by the USKhD party, our former allies, they can bring stability and order to the country. As Oleksandr Shapoval believes, the Hetmanist movement still has a great potential, and [GetUKRTitle] Vasyl, is an example of a great man, who can be a figurehead of our nation. The Hetmanist influence was always a backbone in the UPSS's stability, but perhaps it is finally time to end the leftist bias and position ourselves as the true members of the Hetmanist movement - together with the USKhD." 
ukrpol.255.a: "report if you see this" # Restore the monarchy with Hetmanych Danylo! # TODO: Ukraine 0.2 ?
ukrpol.255.b: "We should not restore the monarchy, but still cooperate."
ukrpol.255.c: "Forget about this idea..."

ukrpol.256.t: "Habsburg's Petition"
ukrpol.256.d: "Vilhelm fon Habsburg-Lotarynzkyi, former King of Ukraine and now our interim president, has petitioned to officially change his name to Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. While technically we have no right to forbid him to do it, some of our politicians suggest that a person should be known by his own name, not by a nickname. While the very idea of discussing it is ridiculous, it somehow became a wide-known issue across the governmental officials, which are now making fun of our party that we even consider this as a serious topic for a discussion. Nevertheless, the petition is here and it should not be left unanswered."
ukrpol.256.a: "Let the man call himself whatever he wants!"
ukrpol.256.b: "We belive a president should be called by his own name."

ukrpol.257.t: "UPSS President Primaries"
ukrpol.257.d: "With the presidential elections upcoming, the UPSS has gathered to decide who will represent the party in the following elections. While there are not so many candidates, the official primaries, first in the history of modern Ukraine, should be concluded."
ukrpol.257.d.hrekiv: "With the elections upcoming, the UPSS has gathered to decide who will represent the party in the future election. While the majority is looking towards extending Hrekiv's rule by choosing him as the main candidate, the others suggest Valentyn Otamanovskyi, the chief editor of Vernyhora and foreign minisiter to succeed him and continue the legacy of Samostiyna Ukraina."
ukrpol.257.a: "Dodge the regulations! Vasyl holds more credibility!"
ukrpol.257.b: "Oleksandr Hrekiv for President!"
ukrpol.257.c: "Vernyhora's editor, Valentyn Otamanovskyi!"
ukrpol.257.e: "Conservative candidate, Oleksandr Shapoval!"
ukrpol.257.f: "Left-wing candidate, Opanas Andriyevskyi!"

ukrpol.258.t: "Massacre of Dyrektoria Supporters"
ukrpol.258.d: "Tragic events occurred today in a major Ukrainian city when a demonstration initiated by the opposition Dyrektoria opened fire. It is not known whether it was the police and guardsmen or some provocateur who first opened fire, but the fact remains that unrest, indiscriminate shooting of civilians, blood and chaos ensued. According to preliminary estimates, up to a thousand people could have been killed in the clashes, mostly from the population, and the Dyrektoria has already dubbed the event a \"Massacre\"."
ukrpol.258.a: "That should not have happened this way..."

ukrpol.259.t: "Dyrektoria Organizes Strike"
ukrpol.259.d: "The dissatisfied workers were organized by the opposition Dyrektoria, which continued its blatant anti-government actions. A general strike was called in one of the major industrial centers today, bringing the work of the largest industrial plants to a halt. Additional reinforcements of armed forces have already been deployed to contain the workers' resistance."
ukrpol.259.a: "When will they calm down?"

ukrpol.260.t: "Barricades and Gunfire in Kyiv"
ukrpol.260.d: "Apparently dissatisfied with recent events, members of the Dyrektoria began their active resistance to the legal order in Ukraine. Demonstrations and rallies were organized throughout the country, instigated by the Dyrektoria, but the situation took a most severe turn in Kyiv. In the capital of Ukraine, the rebels erected barricades and the townspeople heard incessant gunfire all day long. Fortunately, the attempted uprising failed and a number of provocateurs were arrested. Nevertheless, blood was shed, and in the near future, the number of victims of the Dyrektoria's actions will probably only increase."
ukrpol.260.a: "The restistance should end as soon as possible"

ukrpol.261.t: "UVO Terrorist Attack in Rivne"
ukrpol.261.d: "Today, the quiet and provincial city of Rivne was subjected to a terrorist attack prepared by UVO extremists. The explosion damaged the city administration building and killed one of the prominent leaders of the party, against whom the attempt was apparently directed. Unfortunately, he could not be saved. The worst thing is that civilians also suffered in the attack, which once again emphasizes the unprincipled nature of radical nationalists and the vicious nature of their activities."
ukrpol.261.a: "The people who use that methods should be hanged!"

ukrpol.262.t: "UVO Member Kills Local Politician"
ukrpol.262.d: "Another politician fell victim to terrorists from the radical wing of the UVO. This time the terrorist was captured alive and will soon face a tribunal, since most of the UVO members are Ukrainian officers. Some politicians are already calling for a complete ban of the UVO in Ukraine, forcible disarmament of all troops where the UVO may have a significant influence, and mass arrests of those involved. In particular, Dmytro Dontsov, who was hiding from justice in his native Melitopil, has already been arrested and sent to the detention center, where he was detained and immediately taken to court."
ukrpol.262.a: "We should reintroduce death penalty for such cases"

ukrpol.263.t: "UVO Attacks Local Batkivschyna Headquarters"
ukrpol.263.d: "Today it became known that the UVO attacked one of the \"Batkivshchyna\" units in the region. Despite the fact that Batkivshchyna is also a military organization, its activities are not limited to this, and this particular unit was engaged in cooperative affairs. In other words, UVO terrorists attacked the food store, destroying everyone who was there at that moment, as well as the supplies themselves, putting the population at risk of receiving their services. Criminal cases have already been opened, and the perpetrators are sure to be found and punished to the fullest extent."
ukrpol.263.a: "We should increase how our HQs are guarded."

ukrpol.264.t: "Corruption Scandal in Cherkasy"
ukrpol.264.d: "A corruption scandal has broken out in Cherkasy, as reported by the Civic Administration of the UPSS. In particular, Hrekiv himself and his \"Batkivshchyna\" were involved in the case. As it turned out, this organization made purchases of food at understated prices, in connection with which the civil administration suspected criminal intent and fraud on a large scale, given that the price was almost 7 times lower than the market price.\n\nHowever, as Hrekiv himself said, first of all, in troubled times he needed to provide food to his comrades-in-arms, and these were the conditions of the deal and there could be no corruption here. At the same time, however, he denied his involvement, saying that in the regions the local bosses are in charge of Batkivshchyna's affairs."
ukrpol.264.a: "We should close our eyes on this in times of trouble."
ukrpol.264.b: "We should take the peasants' side, we are the people's government!"

ukrpol.265.t: "Bolbochan's 'Forgotten Crimean Campaign'"
ukrpol.265.d: "Recently, the historical community under the government has been very concerned that the Crimean operation under the leadership of Petro Bolbochan went almost unnoticed by both history textbooks and public attention. Despite the fact that thanks to Bolbochan's courage and strategic foresight, the UNR troops were able to seize the Crimea almost bloodlessly and in a few days, the Hetman government officially hushed up this heroic deed, as the German government eventually occupied the peninsula and drove Bolbochan out of there.\n\nThe Crimean operation contributed greatly to the further annexation of Crimea to Ukraine, and now the historical community has attempted to shed light on the true event and extol Bolbochan's role in this event. "
ukrpol.265.a: "Everyone should know!"
ukrpol.265.b: "The government should not intervene in such cases."

ukrpol.266.t: "Funds For Batkivschyna HQ In Melitopol"
ukrpol.266.d: "Recently, Hrekiv's Batkivshchyna has been experiencing more and more problems in relation to supply, as well as cooperative and educational issues. This problem is particularly acute in Melitopil, in southern Ukraine, where large cities such as [200.Owner.GetVictoryPointName_11405], Berdianske, and Kherson are located in the neighborhood. The propaganda of Russophile views spreading among the workers who came from Russia and settled in these cities is still strong. \n\nIn this regard, Batkivshchyna is asking the government for a grant for its activities, but a number of ministers, including Shapoval and Bolbochan, fear that the money could be spent by Hrekiv to strengthen his own position."
ukrpol.266.a: "Increase the funds! We are on one side!"
ukrpol.266.b: "They will be fine."

ukrpol.267.t: "Mass Arrests of Dyrektoria Generals"
ukrpol.267.d: "Mass arrests of generals connected with the Dyrektoria began. Now that the Dyrektoria had begun active resistance activities, the loyalty of a number of high-ranking officers of the General Staff came into question, prompting mass arrests. Also procedural aspects and checks on the activities of these officers for treason, espionage in favor of the enemy, etc., began. It seems that the government will not stop until the army is in full command of it."
ukrpol.267.a: "There's no place for conspiracy!"

ukrpol.268.t: "UVO Officers Escape to Galicia!"
ukrpol.268.d: "The leadership of the UVO, consisting of popular generals and officers has managed to escape our country to Galicia, where they joined the underground movements and are now hiding in the forests. While we have no access to these forests, we have already reported about the incident to the [91.Owner.GetAdjective] government. No signs of UVO presence have been identified yet, unfortunately. We however now that a lot of people, connected with the UVO are still in the country, so the mass arrests are likely to begin soon."
ukrpol.268.a: "Find all the rats!"

ukrpol.269.t: "UPSS Challenges Germany"
ukrpol.269.d: "Under the leadership of UPSS, Ukraine finds itself in a position of renewed strength and determination. Generals, driven by a resolute commitment to Ukrainian nationalism and independence, launched a bold initiative to rearm Ukrainian forces, signaling a growing threat to German hegemony in the region.\nTheir focus lies on the modernization and expansion of the Ukrainian military, redirecting resources and manpower towards building a formidable fighting force. Emphasis is placed on acquiring advanced weaponry, improving military infrastructure, and training highly skilled Ukrainian soldiers. The goal is to establish a military capable of effectively challenging German control and safeguarding Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\nIn a short period of time, UPSS efforts to modernize the Ukrainian military bear fruit, resulting in a significant improvement in the country's defense capabilities. Equipped with advanced weaponry and supported by enhanced infrastructure, the Ukrainian armed forces become a formidable opponent. This reinvigorated military presence serves as a clear warning to Germany that Ukrainian independence will not be easily suppressed.\nWith this, secret supply nodes were created in forests and mountains near borders. Recognizing the challenges of a direct military confrontation with Germany, Generals emphasize the use of partisan warfare and guerrilla tactics to weaken German control and inspire popular resistance. Ukrainian forces are trained in unconventional warfare, sabotage operations, and hit-and-run strategies, aiming to disrupt German supply lines and undermine their grip on Ukraine.\n\nIf Germany will not cope with independent Ukraine, we will force them to."
ukrpol.269.a: "Launch Ukrainian war machine! Either Independent Ukraine, or no Ukraine!"

Drawing a lot from Mosley and Mussolini, new movement orients towards revolutionary violence, anti-religious propaganda, mysticism and radical forms of ethno-nationalism.

A rule of nation. It is based on principles of national solidarity (superclassism and anti-partyism); authoritarianism (personal responsibility of managers at all levels for their actions); qualitative social hierarchy and discipline; self-organization and self-government.\nThe state is interpreted by natiocrats as the most optimal form of existence of the nation.\n\n\"Only through its own state does a nation become a creative factor in history and a full-fledged master of its own destiny. Without it, the nation always and inevitably becomes the subject of enslavement and exploitation by other state nations.\"\n\nThe form of social organization of the natiocracy is state syndicalism, which determines the social value (and, accordingly, the limits of rights and responsibilities) of an individual depending on the volume and nature of the production functions performed by him. \"... based on the indivisible unity of the nation - at the same time reckons with the organicity of its division into separate components and links these latter into unity again by functional dependence, realizing in this way its content of the regime of domination of the entire nation in its own state\".\nAs one of the main theoretics of natiocracy, Mykola Stsiborskyi outlines, natiocracy is hostile towards reactionary nationalism, declaring them traitors of nation and bourgoise servants.\n\"...next to the nationalist struggle of various peoples, various groups use nationalism slogans for their anti-social purposes. These "nationalists" come mainly from the environment of speculators of financial capital, owners of land latifundia, reapers of dividends from the values produced by the intellectual and physical labor of other people. These legalized gangsters of capitalism are often disguised as nationalism, declare themselves his "allies" and manipulate his constructive principles.\""

ukrsun.2.t: "Dontsov’s UPNR"
ukrsun.2.d: "The Ukrainian Party of National Work, united around the 'Zahrava' ('Dawn') magazine and spearheaded by Dmytro Dontsov is a less-known, radical party, that appeared in 1928 before the first Soim elections. Central to Dontsov's ideology is the imperative to strengthen the nation's will for life, power, and expansion. He emphasizes the need for Ukrainian nationalists to exhibit an unwavering drive and a relentless pursuit of struggle. Dontsov considers fanaticism and immorality as fundamental requisites for true nationalism, rejecting the principles of universal values and the 'petty bourgeoisie' ethics. For him, the national idea must be 'immoral' in the sense that it transcends conventional norms and is guided solely by the divine truth revealed to the faithful. This immorality manifests in the aggressiveness and intolerance towards opposing views that characterize Dontsov's followers. The ideological proximity between Dontsov's 'active nationalism' and the UVO's 'organized nationalism' did not lead to fruitful political cooperation. In fact, the militant and destructive nature of Dontsov's theses drew criticism from UVO members, although this criticism remained largely private. The differences between Dontsov's 'active nationalism' and UVO's 'organized nationalism' centered on priorities rather than principles. Dontsov emphasized the cult of the nation's spontaneous will to live and rule, aiming to educate a new generation of strong-willed Ukrainians. In contrast, UVO focused on building a hierarchical and disciplined organization capable of achieving a national revolution and establishing a national dictatorship. Despite Dontsov's foundational role in Ukrainian nationalism, he was never a member of the UVO.\n\nIn the early 1920s, Dontsov's ideas faced limited resonance within Ukraine and emigration circles. Many Ukrainians at the time viewed Austria and Poland, rather than Russia, as their main adversaries, given the post-civil war and Bolshevik-inflicted destruction within Russia.\n\nDontsov's ideology of active nationalism emerges as a forceful call to action, advocating for a transformative vision of Ukraine's future. It emphasizes the indomitable will of the nation, the pursuit of struggle, and the rejection of conventional moral standards in service of a higher truth. While Dontsov's ideas did not find immediate widespread acceptance, they laid the conceptual foundations for Ukrainian nationalism and sparked ongoing debates about the most effective path toward a strong and united Ukraine."

ukrsun.3.d: "The Great Gathering of Ukrainian Nationalists has commenced, bringing together leaders and representatives from various nationalist factions. The air is filled with anticipation as discussions on unity and a shared vision for Ukraine's future begin. The delegates, clad in their respective insignias and symbols, gather in a grand hall adorned with the colors of the Ukrainian flag and resonating with the echoes of passionate conversations. Representatives from notable nationalist groups, including the largest one - UVO, led by [GetUVOLeader], the Ukrainian Nationalist Youth Group (GUNM) led by Osyp Boidunyk, Yuliian Vassiian, and Oles Babii, the National-Revolutionary Movement (NRR) led by Mykola Stsiborskyi, the Union of Ukrainian Nationalist Youth (SUNM) led by Mykhailo Demkovych-Dobrianskyi and Bohdan Kravtsiv, the National Scout Organization of Ukraine (Plast) led by Oleksandr Tysovskyi, and the Ukrainian Party of National Work (UPNR) or Group 'Zahrava' led by Dmytro Dontsov, have assembled.\n\nAs the delegates settle into their seats, a wave of anticipation sweeps through the gathering. The opening ceremony sets the stage for the monumental task at hand - to unify the diverse nationalist factions under a shared purpose. The atmosphere crackles with energy as leaders from various groups exchange greetings, their eyes alight with the hope of forging a stronger, united front. As the delegates settle into their seats, Yaroslav Baranovskyi takes the stage. With passion in his voice, a close friend and proxy of Yevhen Konovalets, his voice carries the weight of history as he reminds the attendees of the trials and triumphs that have shaped Ukrainian nationalism. Baranovskyi speaks of heroes who fought for the nation's independence, invoking a sense of shared pride and resilience, particularly mentioning the Battle of Kruty, the camps of Tsaritsyn, and the recent successful coup d'etat against the corrupt government. Finally, he emphasizes the urgent need for collaboration and unity in the face of common challenges, drawing on the shared heritage and aspirations that bind them together."

ukrsun.4.t: "Demkovych-Dobrianskyi's Speech"
ukrsun.4.d: "Amidst the sea of eager faces, a leader of the SUNM, Mykhailo Demkovych-Dobrianskyi, steps forward. Clad in the vibrant emblem of the SUNM, his presence commands attention. The hall falls into a hushed silence as all eyes turn to him, eagerly awaiting his words.\n\n\"My fellow Ukrainians, today we stand united, not only in our love for Ukraine but also in our determination to shape its destiny. We are the torchbearers of a new era, a generation that yearns for a Ukraine united in purpose and vision. To achieve this, we must shed the shackles of division that have hindered our progress for far too long..."\nAs Mykhailo goes on, his voice reverberates with conviction, reaching the hearts of the attendees, particularly the enthusiastic members of the GUNM. Osyp Boidunyk, Yuliian Vassiian, and Oles Babii, the influential leaders of the GUNM, nod approvingly as they grasp the significance of Mykhailo's message. Their eyes gleam with anticipation, recognizing the potential the fresh perspectives of Ukrainian nationalist movement.\n\"Let us set aside our differences and seek common ground,\" Mykhailo continues. As Mykhailo's words echo through the hall, the energy in the room intensifies. The visionary leader's call to action ignites a fervor among the younger generation, who feel empowered to bridge the gaps that have plagued the nationalist movement. They see a future where fresh ideas intertwine with the wisdom of the past, where the voices of all factions are heard and respected. \n\nAs the Great Gathering progresses, the seeds of understanding and cooperation begin to take root, propelling the Ukrainian nationalists on a path towards a united future."
ukrsun.4.a: "The unity of nationalists is our primary goal."

ukrsun.5.t: "Defending Ukrainian Identity"
ukrsun.5.t2: "The Call for Centralized Leadership"
ukrsun.5.d: "Yevhen Konovalets, the respected leader of the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), enters the stage. The anticipation in the hall is palpable, and the crowd listens intensely, waiting to hear his resounding words. In his fiery speech, Konovalets attaches paramount importance to the preservation of Ukrainian identity and culture. With unwavering conviction, he stresses that the national character of Ukraine must be protected at all costs. He reminds the audience of the historical struggles and sacrifices that have shaped the Ukrainian people, urging them to cherish and preserve their unique heritage.\n\nKonovalts' words resonate deeply with his staunch supporters, especially within the UVO ranks. They find comfort in his unwavering commitment to a strong army, seeing it as a bulwark that will protect Ukrainian interests. For them, the preservation of the Ukrainian identity goes hand in hand with a robust defense capability.\n\nHowever, not everyone present shares the same enthusiasm for Konovalets' speech. Some nationalist groups, which prioritize alternative approaches to preserving the Ukrainian identity, listen to the speech with skepticism. They doubt that a focus on a strong army could overshadow the importance of preserving culture and promoting Ukrainian values through education, the arts and grassroots initiatives.\n\nWhen Konovalets concludes his speech, the large hall is filled with a mixture of emotions. UVO members applaud their leader's unwavering dedication, while others engage in heated debates: the stage is now set for further discussions and negotiations among the nationalist factions. The Great Zbir serves as a crucible for the formation of a collective vision that encompasses both defense of the nation and concern for its rich cultural heritage."
ukrsun.5.d2: "Andriy Melnyk, the respected leader of the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), takes center stage. The room falls silent, awaiting his words with bated breath. Melnyk's speech focuses on a pressing topic that has long divided the nationalist factions: the issue of centralization and the role of strong, centralized leadership. With unwavering conviction, Melnyk underscores the necessity of a centralized structure to ensure the success of the nationalist movement. He argues that a unified front, led by a powerful and authoritative figure, is vital in the face of external challenges and internal divisions. Melnyk asserts that a strong leadership core will bring cohesion, streamline decision-making, and provide the movement with the strategic direction it needs to achieve its goals.\n\nHis message resonates with those who value stability and efficiency. Supporters within the UVO, as well as other nationalist groups who share his belief, find solace in his call for a centralized framework. They view it as a means to overcome the fragmentation that has sometimes hindered the nationalist movement's progress.\n\nHowever, not everyone is convinced by Melnyk's argument. Some nationalist factions, including those who advocate for a more decentralized approach, listen with skepticism. They raise concerns about the concentration of power and the potential suppression of diverse perspectives within a centralized structure. For them, a more participatory and inclusive decision-making process is crucial to maintaining the movement's grassroots ideals.\n\nAs Melnyk concludes his impassioned speech, the room erupts into a mix of applause and fervent discussion. The nationalist delegates engage in animated conversations, debating the merits and drawbacks of centralized leadership."
ukrsun.5.a: "Defending Ukrainian identity by any means!"
ukrsun.5.b: "The leadership question will be eventually solved."

ukrsun.6.t: "Ideological Fractures"
ukrsun.6.d: "The Velykyi Zbir reaches a critical point when discussions about unity and a common vision for the future of Ukraine lead to ideological clashes. There is a quiet murmur in the hall when Mykola Stsiborskyi, a representative of the National Revolutionary Movement (NRR), takes the floor. Dressed in a military uniform with a bright, black and red NRR armband, he attracts attention. However, his words do not resonate with some of the assembled nationalists. Stsiborskyi presents a radical vision of a revolutionary, national-syndicalist system combining authoritarian and decentralized governance. Although his rhetoric finds support among some of the younger participants, it meets resistance from older nationalists, especially [GetUVOLeader] and Dmytro Dontsov. The clash of ideals becomes apparent as Stsiborskyi's speech unfolds, exposing deep divisions within the movement.\n\nThe rich voices of dissent begin to create an undercurrent of division in the great hall. The once harmonious symphony of beliefs turns into a cacophony of contradictory voices, each vying for dominance and influence over the direction of the movement. Ardent supporters of the UVO sharply reject Stsiborskyi's proposal as a reflection of their unwavering commitment to Ukrainian nationalism. Samiylo Pidhirskyi, a member of 'Zahrava', voices even sharper criticism. Meanwhile, members of the SUNM, driven by a progressive and revolutionary vision, applaud Stsiborskyi's speech.\nIn the face of this ideological split, leaders and representatives face the challenge of finding common ground. The future of the Ukrainian nationalist movement seems to be hanging by a thread. The once shared vision of Ukraine's future becomes blurred, overshadowed by contrasting ideals that are emerging in the great hall. As tensions rise and divisions deepen, the path toward a unified movement seems uncertain, casting a shadow of doubt over the collective fate of Ukrainian nationalism."

ukrsun.7.t: "Dontsov’s 'Active' Nationalism"
ukrsun.7.d: "Following Stsiborskyi's impassioned speech on national-revolutionary potential of Ukraine, the Great Gathering eagerly awaits the next speaker. Dmytro Dontsov, a prominent figure representing the Ukrainian Party of National Work, or, commonly, 'Zahravists', takes the stage to deliver a powerful address on his ideology of Active Nationalism and its pivotal role in shaping the future of Ukraine. Dontsov's presence commands attention as he begins to articulate his vision for a Ukraine yet to be realized. With conviction and fervor, he emphasizes that the Ukraine they desire does not exist in the present, but rather it must be created in their hearts and souls. He asserts that Ukrainians should harbor no illusions about the reality of their homeland, which he perceives as occupied by a mentally alien element. Dontsov passionately argues that it is incumbent upon both the nationalists and those they see as occupiers to feel the distinction and reclaim the essence of their own identity.\n\nAs his words reverberate through the hall, they evoke a range of reactions from the gathered nationalists. Some nod in agreement, recognizing the necessity of cultivating a burning desire to forge their own destiny amidst the chaos. Dontsov challenges the prevailing sentiment of complacency and advocates for the transformation of \"Little Russian tenderness\" into a resolute love of their own homeland. He asserts that until theorems become axioms and dogmas, \"shyness\" gives way to \"brutality,\" and a passive \"people's love\" transforms into aggressive nationalism, Ukraine cannot truly become a nation.\n\nHowever, Dontsov's speech does not resonate uniformly with the entire gathering. Among the attendees, there are those who question the aggressive and confrontational tone espoused by Dontsov. Some nationalists express concerns about the potential risks of crossing the line into extremism or creating divisions within society. They argue for a more measured approach that can engage a broader spectrum of Ukrainian society.\n\nSupporters of Dontsov's active nationalism ideology rally behind his words, viewing them as a call to action and a stark reminder of the work that lies ahead. They embrace the notion of creating a new Ukraine through resolute determination and unwavering nationalism. As the echoes of Dontsov's speech fade, the Great Gathering finds itself at a crossroads. The nationalist movement faces the challenge of reconciling differing perspectives on the path to a united and strong Ukraine."

ukrsun.8.d: "As [GetUVOLeader], Stsiborskyi and Dontsov have ended their speeches, the Zbir enters a phase of intense debates on strategy and tactics. The faction leaders, driven by their shared goal of achieving an sovereign Ukrainian Nationalist State, grapple with the challenges posed by foreign powers and the intricate path towards their envisioned future. The discussions unfold in a grand hall filled with fervor and conviction and the air crackles with passion as arguments clash and visions collide.\n\n[GetUVOLeader], the leader of the UVO, urges for a strong military stance, emphasizing the need to safeguard Ukrainian identity and culture from external threats. He advocates for a strategy centered around bolstering the nation's defensive capabilities, standing firm against foreign encroachments, and preserving the unique essence of the Ukrainian people.\n\nDmytro Dontsov, renowned for his ideology of active nationalism, brings a distinct perspective to the table. He emphasizes the importance of crafting a strategy that taps into the fervent will of the Ukrainian nation. Dontsov advocates for a relentless pursuit of the national idea, pushing for unity within the nationalist movement and the cultivation of a passionate desire to create a new Ukrainian world."

ukrsun.9.d: "The ongoing discussions take a critical turn as the focus shifts towards winning the support of the rural poor, urban workers, and countering the influence of socialist and republican movements, most importantly, the Dyrektoria and the Borotbysts. Two prominent figures step forward to present their contrasting viewpoints on these matters, sparking a spirited debate among the attendees.\n\nAndriy Melnyk advocates for a strategy focused on grassroots mobilization. He emphasizes the importance of addressing the concerns and needs of the rural poor and urban workers, who often find themselves drawn to socialist ideologies due to economic disparities and social injustices. Melnyk proposes to provide economic support and improve the living conditions of the marginalized. He believes that by demonstrating a genuine commitment to the welfare of the people, the nationalist movement can gain their trust and secure their support.\n\nIn stark contrast, Yuliian Vassiian, a charismatic figure known for his fervent nationalism, advocates for a more aggressive approach in combating socialist movements. He believes that appeasement and welfare programs will only embolden the socialists and weaken the nationalist cause. Vassiian proposes a strategy centered on staunch opposition and active suppression of socialist activities. He emphasizes the need to expose the flaws and dangers of socialist ideologies through vigorous propaganda campaigns, educational initiatives, and ideological counterattacks. Vassiian argues that by presenting a forceful alternative to socialism and highlighting its inherent shortcomings, the nationalist movement can win over the hearts and minds of the people and effectively undermine the socialist influence.\n\nAs the debate ensues, tensions rise between the supporters of Melnyk's welfare-oriented approach and those who align with Vassiian's uncompromising stance against socialism."

ukrsun.9.b: "Only firm grip will make us strong."

ukrsun.10.t: "Military, Guerrilla Warfare, and Propaganda"
ukrsun.10.d: "The debates on strategy and tactics reach a pivotal moment as the focus shifts towards discussions on the role of the military, guerrilla warfare in Western Ukraine, and the power of propaganda in advancing the nationalist cause. The debates delve into three critical areas: the military, guerrilla warfare, and propaganda.\n\n[GetUVOLeader] takes the floor, emphasizing the importance of a well-trained and disciplined military force. He advocates for a strategy centered around conventional warfare, highlighting the need for large-scale mobilization and the acquisition of modern weaponry. [GetUVOLeader] argues that a strong, centralized military command is essential for effective coordination and successful engagements with the enemy. He calls for increased investment in military training, infrastructure, and technological advancements to ensure Ukraine's defense and national sovereignty.\n\nBohdan Kravtsiv, a renowned leader of the SUNM, presents an alternative perspective rooted in guerrilla warfare and asymmetric tactics. He argues that a nimble and agile approach is necessary to counter a formidable adversary. Babii emphasizes the significance of small, highly mobile units operating in the forested terrain of Western Ukraine, engaging in hit-and-run attacks, ambushes, and sabotage. He believes that guerrilla warfare can disrupt the enemy's control, demoralize their forces, and gradually wear them down, ultimately leading to victory.\n\nOles Babii, a charismatic leader within the GUNM, advocates for the power of propaganda and ideological warfare. He highlights the importance of shaping a strong national narrative and effectively disseminating it to the masses. Kravtsiv proposes the creation of a dedicated propaganda apparatus, responsible for influencing public opinion through various channels such as newspapers, radio broadcasts, and public rallies. He emphasizes the need to counter enemy propaganda, expose their weaknesses, and mobilize the population through persuasive messaging and educational campaigns.\n\nAs the debates unfold, tensions arise between the proponents of conventional warfare, guerrilla tactics, and propaganda. Each viewpoint carries its own merits and challenges, and the delegates must make a difficult decision in selecting a singular approach. The choice between [GetUVOLeader]'s conventional military strategy, Kravtsiv's guerrilla warfare tactics, or Babii's emphasis on propaganda will shape the direction of the nationalist movement's efforts in countering their adversaries and promoting their cause."

In a symbolic show of unity, the leaders affix their signatures to a declaration, cementing their unwavering commitment to the principles, goals, and strategies of the SUN. The document serves as a compass, guiding the organization towards its noble mission - to safeguard Ukrainian identity, protect national interests, and forge an independent and prosperous nation. With resolute determination, the SUN embraces the principles of self-determination, cultural preservation, and the empowerment of the Ukrainian people. To ensure effective governance, representatives from each faction assume vital roles within the SUN's leadership council, known as the 'Provid'. Handpicked for their leadership qualities and dedication, these individuals hold the collective responsibility of steering the organization, devising strategies, and championing the aspirations of Ukrainian nationalists. The birth of the SUN marks an extraordinary milestone, transcending ideological barriers and uniting nationalists under a common purpose.

ukrsun.12.d.7b: " Surprisingly, those who fully embrace Dontsov's transformative vision, became a majority. [GetUVOLeader] steps aside, allowing Dontsov to assume a leadership role. Dontsov's unyielding dedication to Ukrainian identity and his call for a morally guided national idea resonate deeply within the Provid."
ukrsun.12.d.8a: "\nWith a focus on defensive capabilities, the UVO's plan finds support from the delegates. Vasyl Kuchabskyi, Melnyk's confederate with his expertise in military affairs places him at the Provid, championing a strong and well-prepared national defense as a top priority."
ukrsun.12.d.8b: "\nContrasting the UVO's approach, Roman Bzheskyi, the Volhynian native Pole, though member of Zahrava, emphasizes cultural transformation as a means to advance the nationalist cause. His unwavering commitment to reviving Ukrainian heritage and identity secures him a leading role in the Provid."
ukrsun.12.d.9a: " Mykhailo Demkovych-Dobrianskyi, from the SUNM, stands out as a strong advocate for Melnyk's pragmatic plan to win popular support through initiatives aimed at improving the lives of the people, wins him a sit at the Provid."

The debate unfolded without the formation of factions, as the majority resolutely stood behind Yevhen Konovalets. His unwavering commitment to the nationalist cause and his remarkable leadership skills had earned him the trust and support of his peers. As the name of Konovalets echoed through the hall, a wave of applause swept through the audience, recognizing his steadfast dedication and vision. With the resounding support of the Zbir, Konovalets ascended to the esteemed position of Vozhd, heralding a new chapter in the history of the Ukrainian National State."
ukrsun.13.d2: "With the early death of Yevhen Konovalets, the responsibility to lead the nation fell upon the shoulders of Andriy Melnyk. The constitutional proposal put forth by Vasyl Kuchabskyi, the secretary of the SUN, had paved the way for the establishment of the Vozhd as the permanent head of state. As the deliberations ensued, it became evident that the majority aligned with Melnyk's principles and his unwavering commitment to a centralized and disciplined leadership. The room erupted with applause as the election of Melnyk was confirmed, recognizing his exceptional qualities and the pivotal role he would play in shaping the destiny of the Ukrainian National State.

ukrsun.14.d: "With the establishment of the SUN as a united political force, the Provid recognized the valuable contributions and incorporated structures of the Ukrainian Nationalist Youth Group (GUNM) and the Union of Ukrainian Nationalist Youth (SUNM). Acknowledging their dedication and commitment to the cause, the Provid decided to integrate these organizations into the new Association of Ukrainian Nationalist Youth (SUNM).\n\nThe old SUNM, which had been established in 1926 as an association of ideological groups in Galicia, had developed a strong presence among high school students in Lviv and had secret circles in secondary schools. Meanwhile, the GUNM, founded by Myron Konovalets among Ukrainian soldiers, focused on publications through its journal \"Natsionalna Dumka\", uniting students from all-Ukraine.\n\nRecognizing the experience, passion, and dedication of these youth organizations, the Provid of the SUN saw the potential for further growth and influence by unifying their efforts. Thus, the decision was made to establish the Spilka Molodi as the official youth wing of the SUN. Under this new structure, the youth organisations would continue their missiona of ideological training, political action, and youth activism, but now with the backing and support of the broader SUN party. The party's leadership emphasized the importance of compulsory participation in the SUNM for all children of Ukraine from the age of 14, ensuring a comprehensive and unified approach to patriotic education. To enhance this educational process, the SUNM will organize a variety of activities and events, including solemn marches, parades, military games, sports competitions, hikes, and youth gatherings. These activities aimed to foster a sense of national pride, develop physical and mental discipline, and instill a deep understanding of Ukrainian nationalism among the youth. The SUNM is to become a platform for young men and women to learn, grow, and become true patriots and defenders of Ukraine, under the guidance and support of the SUN Provid."

It is a national scout organization, which was engaged in physical, military development and theoretical education of youth. \n\nSoon Plast began to spread to the rest of Ukraine. The largest cells were Bela Cerkva and Chernigov. The greeting-cry of the Plast members was \"SKOB!\"\n\nThe UVO leadership believes that Plast should become the official youth organization of the Ukrainian State. Although formally it does not change anything in the activity of the organization, the ideological implication of Ukrainian nationalism will be manifested more and more strongly. "

ukrsun.16.d: "In a stunning turn of events, the Stsiborskyi's faction in the SUN was able to pull off a strategic but gentle coup, effectively seizing control of the party and reshaping its ideology. This historic moment unfolded during the Second Great Gathering of the party, where the NRR's influence became evident as they secured a majority in the Party Provid. After gaining a new majority, they elected Stsiborskyi as the new Providnyk of the party, cementing his position as the leader of the SUN.\n\nUnder Stsiborskyi's leadership, the SUN is to undergo a significant ideological transformation. The new Providnyk wasted no time in adopting a revised program that incorporated national-revolutionary principles. The ideology of the party began to reflect a fusion of nationalist and revolutionary ideals, emphasizing aspirations for national liberation, radical change, and working-class empowerment.\n\nAlthough the 'soft' coup within the SUN changed the direction of the party, it did not diminish the authority and influence of the current Vozhd, [ROOT.GetLeader], who remained the leader of the nation. However, the role of the Vozhd became more symbolic and ceremonial, as power and decision-making authority were now in the hands of the newly elected Providnyk.\n\nThe rise of the NRR and the election of Stsiborskyi as Providnyk marked a new era in Ukrainian politics, characterized by the fusion of national-revolutionary ideals and the reorientation of the SUN's goals toward achieving national liberation.

ukrsun.17.t: "Second Velykyi Zbir of SUN"
ukrsun.17.d: "In a dramatic turn of events, the Integralist faction, led by Dmytro Dontsov, orchestrated a remarkable seizure of power in the SUN, bringing its ideology to the forefront. This momentous event occurred during the Second Great Gathering of the party, where the Integralists, through strategic maneuvering, secured a majority in both the assembly and the Provid.\n\nThe Second Great Zbir is to become a watershed moment in the history of the SUN, as the Integralists, under Dontsov's leadership, successfully performed a strategic coup, changing the trajectory of the party. After gaining a majority of votes, they elected Samiylo Pidhirskyi, a close associate of Dontsov, as the new Providnyk of the party, thus consolidating their power. Under the leadership of Pidhirskyi, who rigorously adhered to Dontsov's integralist ideology, the new Provid wasted no time in adopting a revised program that reflected the basic principles of Dontsov's integral nationalism. The ideology of the party shifted to a vision of an organic and hierarchical society, emphasizing the values of traditionalism, spiritual renewal, and the primacy of the nation.\n\nAlthough the soft coup in the SUN changed the direction of the party, it did not diminish the authority and influence of the incumbent Vozhd, [ROOT.GetLeader], who continues to wear the mantle of leader of the nation. However, the role of the Vozhd became more symbolic and ceremonial, as power and decision-making authority passed into the hands of Pidhirskyi and Dontsov.\n\nThe aftermath of the Second Velykyi Zbir will undoubtedly change the country, ushering in a new era of integralist ideology and aspiration for a transformed Ukraine based on traditional values and national rebirth."

ukrsun.18.d: "The faction led by Mykola Stsiborskyi has experienced a gradual isolation. The ideological differences between Stsiborskyi's national-revolutionary faction and the dominant Provid led to a diminishing influence of Stsiborskyi within the party. As the [ROOT.GetLeader]'s faction became the guiding force of the SUN, Stsiborskyi's faction found itself increasingly marginalized. The stronghold of the Integralists in Western Ukraine limited the reach and support for Stsiborskyi's nationalist revolutionary movement in the region. Consequently, Stsiborskyi became at most a regional leader within the SUN, with his influence primarily confined to Western Ukraine.\n\nThe dwindling influence and regionalization of Stsiborskyi's faction within the SUN signaled a shift in the party's power dynamics and the overall political landscape.\n\nWith limited avenues for influence and a diminished political presence, Stsiborskyi is likely to focus on regional leadership within his faction and, over time, potentially distance himself from active involvement in national politics."

ukrsun.19.d: "In a surprising turn of events, Dmytro Dontsov, the prominent leader of the Integralist faction, announced his resignation from the SUN and stepped down from his position. This decision marked a significant loss of power for the Integralists, as Ukraine began to distance itself from the once influential ideology. Dontsov's resignation came amidst mounting public discontent and growing opposition to the Integralist agenda. The Ukrainian people, disillusioned by the divisive nature of 'Active Nationalism', had voiced their dissatisfaction with the direction the country was heading. The oppressive policies and radical rhetoric promoted by the Integralists had failed to resonate with the majority of Ukrainians, who sought a more harmonious society.\n\nAs the Integralists found themselves increasingly isolated and marginalized, their influence waned, and the SUN began to distance itself from any signs of Dontsov's influence. The resignation of once most popular ideologue of the party marks a moment of party's great renewal."

You will strive to expand the strength, fame, wealth and area of the Ukrainian state.\n\nStudents read it in unison as a prayer, and the ones who refused — were beaten.

The organization organizes educational programs, cultural events, and physical training to cultivate a generation of dedicated nationalist activists. Through the Donstovite Youth Movement, Dontsov aims to empower young Ukrainians as leaders and champions of Ukrainian nationalism, working towards the goal of a sovereign and independent Ukraine."

ukrsun.47.b: "Make it clear that SUNM is the only official organisation of the party!"

ukrsun.48.t: "Intellectual Circles and Salons"
ukrsun.48.d: "Dontsov, recognizing the power of intellectual discourse in shaping national consciousness, decides to lead the organization of intellectual circles and salons. These gatherings would serve as a platform for meetings of nationalist thinkers, writers, and artists, for substantive discussions and promotion of the ideals of Ukrainian nationalism. Through thought-provoking dialogues, these circles and salons will delve into the historical, cultural, and political aspects of Ukrainian identity, fostering a deeper understanding of the nation's rich heritage. Participants will exchange ideas, share their work, and seek ways to advance the nationalist cause in their fields. Intellectual circles and salons will serve as incubators for the development and dissemination of nationalist thought, encouraging critical thinking, creativity, and unity among like-minded people. Dontsov's vision of intellectual enlightenment through these gatherings will help cultivate a vibrant intellectual community dedicated to sustaining and promoting the ideals of Ukrainian nationalism."
ukrsun.48.a: "An intellectual nationalism."

ukrsun.49.t: "Poet of Spring Intoxication"
ukrsun.49.d: "In the nationalist movement, Bogdan Ihor Antonych, a poet and intellectual, becomes a prominent figure. His poetry, combining the principles of Imagism with a life-affirming paganism inspired by Lemkos folklore, captures the hearts and minds of Ukrainians. In his poems, Antonych beautifully depicts vivid images of the Ukrainian landscape and weaves into them the rich tapestry of Lemky folklore. He declares himself "a pagan in love with life" and takes on the role of "poet of spring intoxication." Antonych's poetry becomes a powerful means of propaganda for Ukrainian nationalism and cultural revivalism. His words evoke a deep sense of national pride and kindle a yearning for freedom and independence.\n\nThrough his writings, he encourages Ukrainians to connect with their cultural heritage and celebrate their unique identity. To develop intellectual discourse and promote ideas, Antonych participates in Dontsov intellectual circles and salons. Antonych's ability to evoke a deep love of Ukraine and his dedication to the preservation and revival of Ukrainian culture will undoubtedly make him a revered figure among nationalists and cultural enthusiasts. His poetry serves as a guiding star, inspiring Ukrainians to embrace, cherish and appreciate their heritage."
ukrsun.49.a: "Lemko paganism?! What's the REAL source of his intoxication?"

ukrsun.50.t: "The Isenbek Tablets"
ukrsun.50.d: "An amateur Slavic folklorist Yurii Myroliubov has petitioned the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences to fund his restoration of \"Book of Veles\" out of birchen tablets found by Ali Isenbek. These tablets are claimed to detail the teachings of the Slavic Native Religion. The obsessive Myroliubov has been restoring and translating the secret tablets, and his published translations have sparked great controversy among the academia. Many see Myroliubov as a total fraud, as he has refused to show the original book to anyone but his close associates.\n\nMyroliubov's unfinished translation has been partially published in the Lviv-based magazine \"Dazhboh\", which has become the vanguard of the Native Slavic movement in Galicia and Ukraine. Its most prominent writer, Sanskritologist Volodymyr Shaian, experienced a spiritual awakening in the Ukrainian Carpathians and started to envision a Ukrainian-Aryan renaissance in both the arts and religion. The Isenbek Tablets have become major part of this new theology, which outlines a new history of the Rus. Ukraine, the purest of the Slavs, is the direct ancestor of the original Aryan peoples, and Christianity has only tried to shackle the Ukrainian people ever since.\n\nShaian's passionate followers have formed the Knights of the Sun God to organise their new religious movement, and have called for the creation of true Ukrainian spirituality and great national awakening. They have raised more money to allow Myroliubov to finish his translation of the Book of Veles. While this is obviously a fringe movement with little basis in sane thinking, it's technically in the right direction, to further separate the Ukrainian identity from that of Russia. Granting Myroliubov funding is a small matter, but could give us a minor propaganda tool."
ukrsun.50.a: "This is NONSENSE."
ukrsun.50.b: "Hey, if it strengthens the Ukrainian identity..."

ukrsun.51.t: "Rise of the Knights of the Sun God"
ukrsun.51.d: "Amid growing support for the Knights of the Sun God, their charismatic leader Volodymyr Shaian seized the opportunity to consolidate his influence and assert his vision of a true Ukrainian-Aryan revival. The movement's devoted followers, fueled by their passionate convictions and anticipation of change, rallied around Shaian's call for a great national awakening. Through careful planning and strategic coordination, the Knights of the Sun God executed a coup, strategically targeting key positions in SUN leadership and exploiting internal divisions. Their swift and decisive actions took Dontsov and his supporters by surprise, leaving them unable to mount a successful defense against the uprising.\n\nThe coup unfolded with astonishing efficiency, as the Knights of the Sun God quickly gained control of the most important institutions and channels of power in the nationalist movement. Their influence went beyond mere verbiage, and their loyal adherents occupied key positions and institutions, further consolidating their power. As news of the coup spread, a mixture of shock and anticipation permeated Ukrainian society. The sudden change of leadership in the SUN reflected the growing desire of many Ukrainians for national identity and a return to their ancient roots. The events of that day clearly marked a turning point in Ukrainian nationalism, as the Knights of the Sun God took the lead. Their ideological fervor and commitment to the revival of Ukrainian spirituality and cultural heritage will determine the course of nationalist discourse and action in the years to come. The coup of the Knights of the Sun God became the culmination of their growing popularity and marked the beginning of a new chapter in Ukrainian history as they set out to reshape the entire state and direct the course of the nation's destiny."

ukrsun.52.t: "The Nationalist-Revolutionary Vanguard"
ukrsun.52.d: "Stsiborskyi, leader of the National-Revolutionaries, today took the bold and unexpected step of announcing the creation of a vanguard organization within the SUN. This organization, called the National Revolutionary Vanguard, was created to unite syndicalists and revolutionary nationalists with the common goal of leading the working class to a revolution that would correspond to the goals of the Ukrainian nationalists.\n\nThe National Revolutionary Vanguard, composed of people of different class backgrounds, sought to bridge the gap between the workers' movement and the nationalist movement. Stsiborskyi, recognizing the potential power of the working class, seeks to use it as a driving force for change in Ukraine. \"We have made a National Revolution, but only by making a Labour Revolution, will Ukraine rise up,\" he declared, \"A working-class-led revolution will be a vital step toward the realization of a true Natiocracy.\"\n\nWithin the SUN, the creation of the National Revolutionary Vanguard has caused only intrigue and controversy. The Old Guard sharply condemned factionalism, while Dontsovites immediately accused Stsiborskyi of Bolshevism.\n\nStsiborskyi and his followers, defying skepticism, had already set about educating and organizing the working class, propagating the ideals of revolutionary nationalism and a national-syndicalist vision of a worker-ruled society. It remains to be seen whether this vanguard organization can successfully navigate the complex dynamic between syndicalism and nationalism and lead the working class toward a revolutionary transformation of Ukrainian society."
ukrsun.52.a: "A pathetic attempt to rally the workers!"

ukrsun.53.t: "The Worker Mobilization"
ukrsun.53.d: "Today Mykola Stsiborskyi, leader of the National Revolutionaries, unveiled his visionary plan to mobilize and organize workers throughout Ukraine. With a firm determination to create a united front, he initiated a series of pioneering initiatives aimed at uniting the proletariat under a common banner of solidarity and empowerment.\n\nUnder Stsiborskyi's leadership, the concept of the "Workers' Legion" was formed. This revolutionary idea was aimed at uniting workers from different branches of industry, breaking the boundaries of their individual professions and fostering a sense of collective identity and purpose. The workers' legion was to become a formidable force capable of upholding the rights and aspirations of the working class.\n\nThrough relentless organizing efforts, Stsiborskyi and his followers have begun to reach factories, mines, and workshops across the country, spreading their message of unity and mobilization. They held rallies, meetings, and created workers' councils to facilitate communication and coordination among labor collectives.\n\nStsiborskyi's initiatives elicited mixed reactions. The established order regarded worker mobilization with suspicion, fearful of challenging its power. Despite the challenges and opposition, Stsiborskyi clearly did not lose heart. He sees in the united front of the workers the potential for transformation and the realization of the ideals of revolutionary nationalism. Using the collective power of the proletariat, Stsiborskyi seeks to form a new social order in which the welfare and dignity of the working class is a priority."
ukrsun.53.a: "This is getting out of hand!"

ukrsun.54.t: "Revolutionary Labor Unions"
ukrsun.54.d: "Today, the NRR faction in the Provid of SUN unveiled its ambitious plan to mobilize and organize workers throughout Ukraine. With its emphasis on centralization and national solidarity, Stsiborskyi launched a series of innovative initiatives aimed at uniting the proletariat under a common banner of collective strength and purpose. Through relentless organizing efforts, Stsiborskyi and his followers reached factories, mines, and workshops throughout the country, spreading their message of unity and mobilization, and the \"Workers' Legion\" only grew stronger. Now the National Revolutionaries are announcing the next step, the creation of Revolutionary Labor Unions in key industrial centers. This became a crucial part of Stsiborskyi's strategy. These unions aim to centralize decision-making processes and allow workers to actively participate in and contribute to policy-making.\n\nOf course, the majority of the Provid rejected these audacious initiatives, accusing Stsiborskyi of Bolshevism, but the \"Workers' Legion\" is only growing stronger and will in time pose a threat not only to our regime, but to our entire nation."
ukrsun.54.a: "The National Revolutionaries' influence grows."

ukrsun.55.t: "National-Syndicalist Propaganda"
ukrsun.55.d: "The National Revolutionaries launched an extensive propaganda campaign aimed at promoting national-syndicalist ideals throughout Ukraine. Recognizing the power of propaganda to shape public opinion, Stsiborskyi and his followers embarked on a mission to spread their message of workers' rights and national liberation. Using a variety of means, such as pamphlets, posters, and public appearances, Stsiborskyi led the spread of national-syndicalist propaganda. The campaign emphasized the correspondence between working class rights and interests and the overarching goals of national liberation espoused by the NRR.\n\nThe propaganda emphasized the belief that the working class, as the backbone of the nation, played a vital role in achieving genuine national independence and transforming society. Stsiborskyi's concept of the centralized movement sought to unite workers in various industries under the banner of national syndicalism, emphasizing their collective strength and common destiny.\n\nThe campaign also sought to challenge the Provid, which often neglected the interests of the working class and prioritized the interests of the military and intellectual elite. Stsiborskyi's propaganda sought to awaken class consciousness among the workers and encourage them to accept their role as agents of change in the struggle for national liberation. Although the propaganda campaign faced opposition from those who saw it as a threat to the existing structures of power, it gained traction among the working class and sympathetic sectors of society. The National Revolutionaries' commitment to workers' rights and national liberation resonated with many who felt marginalized in the new nationalist Ukraine.\n\nBy relentlessly spreading national-syndicalist propaganda, Stsiborskyi and his followers clearly sought to inflame the revolutionary spirit among the working class, preparing the ground for a new revolution in accordance with their vision of a centralized national-syndicalist state."
ukrsun.55.a: "Who will believe these lies?"

ukrsun.56.t: "Confession of the NRR"
ukrsun.56.d: "Stsiborskyi, the leader of the National Revolutionaries, decided to go on the offensive against the existing order. Under his leadership, the National Revolutionaries played a key role in coordinating and supporting the workers' strikes in various industries throughout Ukraine that broke out last week. They actively urged workers to unite and stand up for their rights, emphasizing the connection between workers' demands and the universal struggle for national liberation. These strikes and demonstrations served as a powerful platform for workers to express their discontent and assert their collective strength. With the support of the national revolutionaries, the strikes took on a broader significance, linking workers' struggles for better living and working conditions with the broader national aspirations of Ukraine.\n\nIt is becoming clear that by harnessing the collective strength of the working class, Stsiborskyi sought to disrupt existing power structures and bring about substantial reforms that would benefit workers and advance the cause of national independence. These actions posed a direct and audacious challenge to the established order.\n\nIn the face of opposition and repression, Stsiborskyi and the National Revolutionaries unwaveringly supported the workers' cause, continuing to organize strikes and demonstrations as a means of confronting the existing power structures, improving working conditions, and ultimately paving the way for a truly independent and just Ukraine."
ukrsun.56.a: "So, the man believes he can organize strikes without consequences?"

ukrsun.57.t: "Strikes In Donbas"
ukrsun.57.d: "A wave of strikes broke out in the industrial center of Donbass, causing unrest and drawing national attention. Workers who had long struggled with harsh working conditions and stagnant wages reached a breaking point and took to the streets in a sign of collective frustration and discontent. Workers, united by common struggles and aspirations, demanded better working conditions, fair wages, and a voice in decision-making processes affecting their livelihoods.\n\nAs the strikes intensified, it became apparent that workers had come under the considerable influence of the National Revolutionaries, a political faction that defended working class rights and promoted the ideals of national-syndicalism. The NRR's message of unity, empowerment, and national liberation resonated deeply with Donbass workers, who saw in this movement a potential path to a better future.\n\nThe strikes not only disrupted production activities, but also sent a powerful message to the ruling elite and society at large. Workers who had long been ignored now united in demonstrations of collective strength, demanding their rights and asserting their importance.\n\nThe events in Donbass exposed the deep-rooted problems faced by the working class and foreshadowed the growing influence of national revolutionaries in shaping the trajectory of the labor movement. It was becoming increasingly clear that workers' struggles for better living conditions and national liberation were intertwined."
ukrsun.57.a: "Stsiborskyi was likely to organize them!"

ukrsun.58.t: "Revolutionary Worker Brigades"
ukrsun.58.d: "Today, the leader of the National Revolutionaries decisively announced the creation of Volunteer Revolutionary Worker Brigades, armed detachments consisting of workers and nationalists. These brigades were created with the essential task of defending workers' rights, defending national interests and upholding the revolutionary program of the NRR.\n\nRevolutionary workers' brigades, composed of workers who embraced nationalist-syndicalist views, combined their industrial experience and dedication with the nationalist fervor that swept through their ranks. Armed with a sense of duty and committed to the ideals of the NRR, these brigades represented a formidable force capable of defending the rights and interests of the working class and of advancing the cause of national liberation.\n\nThe workers' revolutionary brigades were entrusted with a number of responsibilities. They were called upon to ensure the smooth functioning of industrial plants, to defend workers' rights in the face of opposition, and to respond promptly to any threats to the revolutionary agenda. These brigades were to serve as a vanguard, ready to confront any challenge arising both at home and abroad in their quest for a more just and equitable society."
ukrsun.58.a: "This is the final warning, Mykola Orestovych!"

ukrsun.59.t: "Empowering Ukrainian Catholic Youth"
ukrsun.59.d: "In the wake of the Ukrainian Youth of Christ celebration in May 1933, circles of the KAUM \"Orly\" (Catholic Association of Ukrainian Youth - Eagles) began to emerge. Under the leadership of Andriy Melnyk, the organization underwent reorganization in the second half of 1936, solidifying its structure and purpose. Melnyk, recognizing the need for a cohesive and structured youth organization, initiated a constituent assembly that elected him as the chairman of the Main Council. The society was designed to have a hierarchical structure, with local clubs divided into age groups forming the lower level of the organization. Separate groups were established for male and female youth to cater to their specific needs and interests.\n\nThe activities of KAUM \"Orly\" focused on religious and ideological education, general and vocational education, and sports. Drawing inspiration from the methodology of Plast, the society placed emphasis on character development and practical skills. Labor camps played a significant role in fostering a sense of discipline, teamwork, and self-improvement among the members. To ensure effective organization and coordination, primary cells, or circles, consisting of at least 11 individuals, were subordinated to the Main Council. Each circle had its own patron, which could be a saint or a historical figure, providing a guiding example and inspiration for its members. The overarching patron of the society was the Archangel Michael, symbolizing courage, strength, and protection.\n\nMembership in KAUM \"Orly\" was categorized into different age groups, reflecting the progression of youth through the organization. Orleniata encompassed those under 14 years old, who belonged to the \"Eaglet Group\" within their circles. Orlyky, aged 14 to 18, joined with the written consent of their parents and did not have voting rights. Orly, between the ages of 18 and 21, were full members of the society, actively participating in its activities. Senior Orly comprised the instructors and leaders, guiding the younger members. Finally, Orliaky, \"the old Eagles\", were honorary members who had aged out of active participation but continued to support the society.\n\nThe establishment of KAUM \"Orly\" under the leadership of Andriy Melnyk provides a platform for Catholic Ukrainian youth to engage in religious, educational, and physical development. Inspired by their patron, the Archangel Michael, the members of KAUM \"Orly\" seek to embody the qualities of courage, strength, and dedication as they worked towards their personal growth and the betterment of their community."

### Dyrektoria and Socialists ###

ukrsoc.1.t: "Victory of the People’s Republic!"
ukrsoc.1.d: "After the capture of Kyiv, the defense of the so-called "Kingdom" fell apart. Soldiers began to defect en masse to our side, realizing our superiority, and some commanders surrendered. Control of Kyiv meant control of the railroad, and our partisans in the south, in conjunction with the Borotbysts, were able to quickly capture key industrial centers.\n\nThe Hetman government managed to escape from Kyiv and found refuge abroad, but along with the German puppets we drove out the Germans themselves. Now Ukraine is truly a people’s republic where people’s power will rule. However, for this to happen, an All-Ukrainian Constituent Congress must be convened."
ukrsoc.1.a: "We should immediately hold All-Ukrainian Congress!"

ukrsoc.2.t: "Anarchy on the Streets"
ukrsoc.2.d: "Despite our victory, we cannot yet say that our power is strong. There is anarchy and looting in many cities. The poor rob the rich, the peasants steal from the landlords. The situation is clearly beyond our control. \n\nSymon Petliura, Otaman of the UNR Army, concurrently Minister of War of the Dyrektoria, proposed the immediate creation of a people’s militia in order to bring the situation in the cities back under the control of the central government. However, many believe that this would only strengthen his authority and that the creation of a militia loyal to and under Petliura’s control might play into his hands."
ukrsoc.2.a: "Whatever, we need to call a congress"
ukrsoc.2.b: "Form the people’s militia to deal with the chaos"

ukrsoc.3.t: "Borotbysts Sabotage the Plants"
ukrsoc.3.d: "The Borotbysts, who were not formally part of the Dyrektoria, began sabotaging the work of the factories, demanding decisive measures from our still-unstable provisional government to improve the lives of workers. Despite the fact that their main electorate is peasants, workers are also under the influence of the Borotbysts. \n\nOleksandr Shumskyi spoke at a rally in Kharkiv, where he stated that until the Directorate takes measures to protect workers' rights, our people’s government is not at all popular, but reactionary and bourgeois. Minister of War Petliura suggested that the strikes be dealt with immediately, that the workers be dispersed, and that we should not wait for the decrees of the legally elected All-Ukrainian Congress."
ukrsoc.3.a: "We can't wait anymore, a congress should be held!"
ukrsoc.3.b: "Petliurivtsi shall restore the work on the plants"

ukrsoc.4.t: "Last Monarchist Resistance in Poltava"
ukrsoc.4.d: "In Poltava, the region which is considered the most conservative, the unrest has been seen ever since the Fall of Rivne. The local Cossacks and large landowners have cooperated and united against the new government in a serious armed uprising. The turmoil is becoming a hotbed for Reaction, as their forces start to become even more consolidated. Otaman Petliura has called for immediate intervention in the region to deal with the rebellion, calm down the peasants and punish the rioters. That will however take us a lot of effort and time, and the Dyrektoria believes that the unrest will eventually fade."
ukrsoc.4.a: "They will calm down eventually, call a congress!"
ukrsoc.4.b: "Calm the Poltava turmoil!"

ukrsoc.5.t: "Rampant Crime in Odesa"
ukrsoc.5.d: "With the departure of the German garrison from Odesa, the situation there became somewhat heated, especially with regard to rampant crime. Nevertheless, the hetman’s oprichniks maintained some order in the city. However, with both of them fleeing and with insufficient control over the city, Odesa experienced a true flowering of criminality and anarchy, stronger than in other cities. \n\nRobbery, looting, and corruption have taken off with renewed vigor, and the local militia of the People’s Republic clearly lacks the strength to suppress it. Petliura addressed a meeting of the Dyrektoria, demanding that troops be immediately sent to Odesa and that all those involved in the looting be arrested, in effect hinting at a curfew and the arrest of anyone who fell under suspicion. This is a very risky step that we cannot take without losing the support of the people."
ukrsoc.5.a: "It’s not a hindrance to the Congress"
ukrsoc.5.b: "Arrest all those involved!" 

ukrsoc.6.t: "Dismissal of the Monarchist Officials"
ukrsoc.6.d: "One of the controversial decisions that must be made as a matter of urgency is the dismissal of all officials who collaborated with the hetman’s regime. \n\nAlthough many in the Dyrektoria are in favor of full lustration, for some this step seems reckless. We can win over to our side the people who have been managing the country for 20 years instead of arresting or firing them all, because unlike the new government, the old apparatus has real work experience."
ukrsoc.6.a: "Dismiss them all!"
ukrsoc.6.b: "We cannot be left without the support of those who have ruled the country for 20 years!"
ukrsoc.6.c: "This should be discussed at the Congress"

ukrsoc.7.t: "Question of the Monarchist Parties"
ukrsoc.7.d: "With the coming of the Dyrektoria to power, the monarchist parties came under attack, to which our government includes all the legal parties that acted in support of the King and the Hetman, namely: UPSS, Lypynskyi’s USKhD, and Skoropadskyi’s SHD.\n\nSome advocate the immediate prohibition of the activity of all counter-revolutionary parties, while others believe that this should be decided at the All-Ukrainian Congress within the framework of the people’s power."
ukrsoc.7.a: "They should be banned!"
ukrsoc.7.b: "The Congress should decide this"

ukrsoc.8.t: "Business is Fleeing the Country!"
ukrsoc.8.d: "The uprising of the Dyrektoria was accompanied not only by increased anarchy and violence throughout the country and mass looting of landed estates, groundless arrests, and a hetmaniacal police force, but also by a more significant factor.\n\nBlack Monday and the crisis that followed brought us to an almost complete economic collapse. Most frightening of all, business is fleeing the country - young and mature entrepreneurs are trying to take time to move their assets to nearby countries still open to them. This is accompanied by a massive brain and personnel drain; in fact, the country is being deprived of its future. Of course, many enterprises have already been nationalized, and in some cases expropriated by the new people's state, but the loss of initiative and entrepreneurial spirit among our citizens may have an effect on our future."
ukrsoc.8.a: "Catastrophic."

ukrsoc.9.t: "The First Day of the Congress"
ukrsoc.9.d: "It was time for the Congress to be called. In many regions of Ukraine, the active creation of local government bodies has already begun, particularly Soviets and Radas, through which various politicians, organizations, and parties plan to make their way to the All-Ukrainian Congress and participate in the legislation of vital and defining bills, as well as vote for the composition of the government."

ukrsoc.10.t: "Controversy in the Poltava Village Council"
ukrsoc.10.d: "In Poltava, which before the Dyrektoria came to power was considered the bastion of the reactionaries and the main stronghold of the Hetman movement, new realities set in. In a village in the Poltavshchyna the situation reached a deadlock. The local council was actually divided 50-50 over which delegates they would support at the All-Ukrainian Congress. \n\nOn the one hand, the position of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, who promise land to the peasants, which is especially important for the predominantly agrarian region of Poltava, is quite strong. On the other hand, the positions of the Ukapists, whose program is aimed not only at the peasants, but also at the workers, are not inferior to the SRs’ one. For the ordinary inhabitants of this small village, this issue proved vital, but it could hardly influence the outcome of the All-Ukrainian Congress. However, the local Poltava newspapers brought attention to the story, with the result that the outcome of the vote in a single village could also influence the polls of the entire Poltavshchyna..."
ukrsoc.10.a: "Poltava village council supports the UPSR..."
ukrsoc.10.b: "Poltava village council turns to the UKP"

ukrsoc.11.t: "All of the Delegates Arrived"
ukrsoc.11.d: "Finally, from Kyiv comes the joyous news that all the delegates from the councils, local Radas, factory commissioners, and national minorities have arrived at the All-Ukrainian Congress. The congress, which is destined to put an end to the Hetman bourgeoisie, unbridled capitalism and robbery of ordinary Ukrainians. The four main parties of the Dyrektoria: the UKP, the UPSR, the USDRP and the ULD(S-F), will offer their versions of the vision of the Ukrainian future, after which delegates will have to vote for the party whose ideas, in their opinion, are the most worthy."
ukrsoc.11.a: "Future of Ukraine is in our hands"

ukrsoc.12.t: "Administrative Division of Ukraine"
ukrsoc.12.d: "In December 1917, Mykhailo Hrushevsky already proposed new administrative divisions, appearing in the newspaper 'Narodna Volya' with the article 'The New Division of Ukraine', in which he described the principles of the new division of Ukraine, which were to be approved by the future Ukrainian Constituent Assembly in the new constitution of the Ukrainian People's Republic: instead of the then division into provinces and counties a division into lands larger than poviats, but smaller than gubernias was proposed. These lands should serve as constituencies for the Ukrainian National Assembly, the basis for building an administrative and judicial network and for the development of public self-government on the basis of decentralization.\n\nOn the advice of specialists, Hrushevsky allocated lands based on the principle that a little more than a million people lived in each. Such a population would be sufficient for the independent establishment of sanitary, road, land, industrial and cultural affairs, as well as for the organization of a sufficient network of secondary education. Each land would have to send at least 10 deputies to the national assembly, which would ensure the possibility of party grouping and proportional elections.\nIn total, Hrushevskyi proposed a detailed division into 30 lands only in the territory of Ukraine where elections to the constituent assembly were to be held; the question of annexation or withdrawal of other adjacent territories should be decided later by a free popular will.\n\nThese proposals were shattered by the Hetmanate government, who returned an old, Tsarist proposal, suited not for democratic government, but for the privileges of ruling classes. But the system worked for years, should we change it now?"

ukrsoc.13.d: "Today, the Central Committee of the UPSR(b), headed by Oleksandr Shumskyi, officially announced a boycott of the elections to the All-Ukrainian Congress, accusing the parties involved of revisionism. However, despite the official statements about the boycott, many of the Borotbyst members supported the UPSR in the elections to the Constituent Congress as their former party-mates and closest ideological allies. "
ukrsoc.13.a: "What are they up to?"

ukrsoc.14.t: "Non-Functioning Plant"
ukrsoc.14.d: "From the moment the Dyrektoria came to power, striking workers flooded the major cities, the strikes paralyzed many factories, and in some cases we can speak of sabotage of production!\n\nHowever, even after some stabilization of society and the economy, many factories throughout the country, including such a massive industrial hub as the Donbas, remain non-functional. This hurts not only our image, but also our economy, production capacity and the industrial potential of our country.\n\nA number of military officials have suggested that workers' strikes should be suppressed and all factories and plants should be brought back into operation immediately, but such an action would be clearly unpopular, though effective. On the other hand, civilian officials from all parties recommend intensified labor propaganda and declarative labor mobilization."
ukrsoc.14.a: "Get the workers to work!"
ukrsoc.14.b: "Promote labour, not violence!"

We can win over to our side the people who have been managing the country for 20 years instead of arresting or firing them all, because unlike the new government, the old apparatus has real work experience."

ukrsoc.16.b: "They should be allowed to exist."

ukrsoc.17.t: "A Discussion of Unions"
ukrsoc.17.d: "Particular attention at the congress was paid to the issue of trade unions. Representatives of numerous trade unions, workers' committees, and committees of factory commissioners came to the congress to vote for the party that best serves the interests of the trade unions and the Ukrainian working class.\n\nThree main programs were put on the agenda. The first, from the Ukapists, offers the unions guarantees of independence from the state, and even participation in economic planning along with the Ministry of National Economy. The second, from the Social Democrats mainly welcomes the self-government of the workers, the development of labor forces and social guarantees for the proletariat. Finally, the third, from the Social Revolutionaries, mainly revolves around the idea of the Labor Republic and the Labor Principle, also assumes the participation of the trade unions in the management of the economy and the \"socialization of factories and enterprises\", that is, the transfer to society and its representatives."
ukrsoc.17.a: "UKP wins the unions’ support"
ukrsoc.17.b: "Trade Unions support USDRP position"

ukrsoc.18.t: "Bourgeousie and Landlords"
ukrsoc.18.d: "One of the most heated issues of discussion at the congress was the question of landlords, the bourgeoisie, and the deprivation of their electoral rights. The idea supported by the majority of the parties is the immediate alienation of voting rights from the representatives of the capitalist exploiting classes, who have been robbing the common people for the past 20 years under the patronage of Hetman and the foreign military. \n\nOn the other hand, the democratic and socialist character of our new republic, as if to prevent any oppression on the basis of class, for in this way we are likened to our enemies, who are in any case in the minority."
ukrsoc.18.a: "They should be deprived of electoral rights!"
ukrsoc.18.b: "Universal vote is preferable."

ukrsoc.19.t: "Adoption of the V Universal"
ukrsoc.19.d: "One of the most solemn events at the convention was the adoption of the so-called 5th Universal. The previous four Universals represent important milestones in the history of Ukrainian independence, from the creation of a body of representation of the Ukrainian people, to the adoption of autonomy, and finally to independence. Today's jubilee Universal has consolidated the basic provisions adopted by the delegates of the All-Ukrainian Congress and put an end, at least in words, to the bourgeois capitalist system in Ukraine that flourished under the Hetman regime.\n\nThe 5th Universal once again confirmed the unconditional independence of Ukraine and its peoples, the future is now open, and Ukraine is once again gaining strength to confront future threats."
ukrsoc.19.a: "The Ukrainian People’s Republic lives on!"

ukrsoc.21.t: "The Congress Ends"
ukrsoc.21.d: "With the Congress ending in a couple of days, it is time to elect the new government and premier of the People’s Republic. With the main political issues discusses, the majority of the Congress chooses the mandate of..."

ukrsoc.21.f: "[GetUVOLeader] and Striltsi disband the Congress..."

## Here comes the UKP events ###

ukrsoc.22.t: "Shakhrai and Vynnychenko"
ukrsoc.22.d: "Sitting near the bar table, Shakhrai thinks about all the struggle and decisions that Ukraine awaits, and his role in it.  Bringing the revolution, with Dyrektoria, and with the UKP, getting the party with such different people behind him, he sits to think about all the comrades, who died, fighting against the Whites, the Germans or the Hetmanists. They wouldn’t see what Ukraine will be — the country of the freed proletariat and peasantry, with the human emancipation and cultural renessaince never seen before under the German rule. \nUnexpectedly, the sit near him was taken. He sees the face of the famous writer, politician, the enemy, his political enemy, and, somehow, a pleasant person to speak with in the bar.\n\"How it’s going?\" — speaks Vynnychenko, starting the long and intresting conversation — a sharp political debate, and a psychological drama, of most famous and important people of Ukrainian politics. After hours of talking, the two started to packing, preparing for another battles of their parties. Feeling the respect to one another, they shaked hands and went to their homes, drunkenly roaming the streets of night Kyiv, only to see each other tomorrow"
ukrsoc.22.a: "Perhaps, a new friendship was born?"

ukrsoc.23.t: "Pan Skoropadskyi ta Tovarish Skorovstanskyi"
ukrsoc.23.d: "Vasyl Shakhrai became known as the People’s Secretary of Military Affairs, one of the authors of the manifesto to the Ukrainian people and one of the leaders of the short-lived Ukrainian People’s Republic of Soviets with its capital in Kharkiv.\n\nSoon after Hetman Skoropadskyi came to power in Kyiv, Shakhrai began writing bantering appeals, signing himself as \"Comrade Skorovstanskyi\", which mocked the Hetman’s last name and hinted that Hetmanist Ukraine was about to rise, but still nothing.\nFor these articles, Shakhrai gained popularity among the common people. Now in power, a new article signed by Comrade Skorovstanskyi was published in the newspaper Molot in which the chauvinistic feudal regime of the Hetman was finally denounced."
ukrsoc.23.a: "Eventually, the Hetman got what he deserved"

ukrsoc.24.t: "A Friendly Talk Down Khreshchatyk"
ukrsoc.24.d: "Kyiv was beautiful, as always! There were a lot of people on the streets, busy with their own things, so no one noticed the little bar on Khreshchatyk, the entrance to which was closed. Inside, there was a friendly discussion between Prime Minister Shakhray and the leader of the Ukrainian Social Democrats, Volodymyr Vynnychenko. \n\nThe bar debates become a daily routine for the Vynnychenko and Shakhray, as their favorite place in Kyiv fills up with people, they filling it with political discussions. Vynnychenko, finds a lot of symphaty to the cause of Shakhray, and, it seems, the same goes for his party Left-wing. The idea of unified left party is mentioned briefly by one of them, speaking on the different topic, only a few words, but the idea makes the two to think: what makes us such different after all? With the left seemingly pushing together for a Ukrainian brand of socialism, not compromising class interests of the workers, maybe its a good moment to speak of the united party? Party of all the left, that will represent all the proletariat, not the fraction, and the peasantry too. Vynnychenko and Shakhray will think about this idea all night, overhearing discussions arising in their parties — is it really possible?"
ukrsoc.24.a: "Comrades, is it the time to have a joint congress with the left of USDRP?"
ukrsoc.24.b: "I don’t think its a good idea."

ukrsoc.25.t: "Legacy of Bolshevism"
ukrsoc.25.d: "Mykola Skrypnyk, known as an old Bolshevik among the party, a member of the RSDRP since 1898, also spoke at the congress. Although Skrypnyk expressed hopes of cooperation with the Russian Communists, he very clearly stressed the need for Ukrainian independence and the development of its culture. Skrypnyk declared that Bolshevism is not a curse or the imperialist needs of the great Russian chauvinists, but is the way of the struggle of the proletariat and Ukraine must be freed from the shackles of capital."
ukrsoc.25.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.26.t: "The Colonial Problem"
ukrsoc.26.d: "At the congress, one of the prominent figures of the party, its 'left wing', Andriy Richytskyi, gave a report, stating that Ukraine, as a country with a strong tradition of freedom and independence, should lead the anti-colonial struggle of the peoples. In particular, he raised the issue that the Third International does not give a solution to the problem of colonialism and proposes a violent "liberation" from the imperialist shackles of the peoples of Africa. Essentially substituting red imperialism for liberation, the politicians of the Commune cannot offer an effective solution to the colonial question, despite their stated support for the oppressed peoples. It is therefore up to Ukraine, shackled for centuries by three empires, to lead this internationalist struggle."
ukrsoc.26.a: "His words have sense"

ukrsoc.27.t: "Necessity of Ukrainisation"
ukrsoc.27.d: "In his speech, Party Chairman Shakhrai spoke of the need for speedy Ukrainianization and expressed his hopes for an independent Soviet Ukraine. As the creator of the concept of 'national communism', Shakhrai once again stated that the aspiration of the Ukrainian spirit is for Ukrainian independence. He also expressed hopes of creating a unified socialist government and joining a coalition of other socialist parties. Shakhray’s speech was full of optimism and energized the delegates gathered at the congress, many of whom expressed confidence in the course of the party."
ukrsoc.27.a: "Good"

ukrsoc.28.t: "Decision of the IV(I) Congress"
ukrsoc.28.d: "Today in Kyiv was the fourth, but also the first since the Directorate came to power, congress of the Ukrainian Communist Party. During the congress, several prominent delegates gave addresses, and now it will be necessary to adopt the most relevant platform and elect a new party chairman.\n\nIn general, the delegates have three favorites: Andriy Richytskyi and his program of party centralization, economics, and the anti-colonial struggle. Mykola Skrypnyk and his Bolshevist national-oriented program. And also the current chairman, Vasyl Shakhrai and his program of democratic communism and Ukrainianization.\nSoon, the decision of the Congress was announced..."
ukrsoc.28.a: "Richytskyi’s platform was chosen"
ukrsoc.28.b: "Party votes for Skrypnyk"
ukrsoc.28.c: "Shakhrai remains in his position"

ukrsoc.29.t: "The Beginning of Ukrainisation"
ukrsoc.29.d: "Today, along with the reform of education, increased Ukrainianization is beginning. The capitalist and landlord government of Hetman and King failed to organize for 15 years decent conditions for the development of Ukrainian national culture, and now the Communist Party is taking over. Soon the Ukrainian people will be not only the most educated, but also added to their spirit of independence."
ukrsoc.29.a: "Together towards new Ukrainian society!"

ukrsoc.30.t: "Creation of Skrypnykivka"
ukrsoc.30.d: "Today the official spelling of the Ukrainian language, called Skrypnykivka, was adopted by a vote at the All-Ukrainian Spelling Conference. Chairman Skrypnyk personally took part in the creation of the literary spelling, in addition to him, famous Ukrainian linguists and even writers also took part, like Mykola Khvyliovyi and Mykola Yalovyi. Linguists from Galicia also took part in the conference.\n\nThe adoption of the new spelling was also responded to in Moscow, where the local government stated that the Ukrainian language is about to be \"artificially separated from the Russian language\". However, the criticism from the Slavic neighbor did not receive much attention, as many linguists on both sides of the argument stated that the language develops naturally and cannot be artificially changed."
ukrsoc.30.a: "Glory to Skrypnykivka"

ukrsoc.31.t: "Ukrainian Futurist Exhibition"
ukrsoc.31.d: "The Ministry of Socialist Enlightenment is ready to organize a world futurist exhibition in Ukraine. The venue was chosen as Kharkiv, a rapidly developing city whose inhabitants would be happy to welcome foreign delegations."
ukrsoc.31.a: "Send the invitations!"

ukrsoc.32.t: "Invitation to the Futurist Exhibition in Kharkiv"
ukrsoc.32.d: "The Ukrainian Government is hosting the International Futurist Exhibition in Kharkiv, clearly with an aim to bring together our nations and show best of Ukrainian Futurist art. Shall we attend?"
ukrsoc.32.a: "We’ll send a delegation!"
ukrsoc.32.b: "That’s too costly now..."

ukrsoc.33.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Delegation Arrives"
ukrsoc.33.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has accepted our invitation and its delegation has already arrived in Kharkiv."
ukrsoc.33.a: "Awesome!"

ukrsoc.34.t: "Kharkiv Hosts Futurist Exhibition"
ukrsoc.34.d: "Today the exhibition of futuristic art was completed in Kharkiv. Many international delegations came to it and got a closer look at Ukrainian culture as well. The event was excellent, not without amusing incidents, but on the whole the guests praised the socialist achievements of Ukraine and its talented new generation of artists."
ukrsoc.34.a: "That was a stunning event!"

ukrsoc.35.t: "Literary Debate Rages"
ukrsoc.35.d: "In a recent heated literary debate, Mykola Khvyliovyi, renowned Ukrainian novelist and poet, has sent shockwaves through the world of literature as he denounces both Russian and Ukrainian literary works in a controversial speech. With fierce conviction, Khvyliovyi has fervently advocated for Ukrainian writers to turn their gaze toward the West, whilst vehemently criticizing the prevailing literature being produced within his own nation and Russia.\n\nKhvyliovyi does not mince words when decrying the nineteenth century classics of Russian literature, condemning them as permeated with \"passive pessimism\" and overrun by \"superfluous people\": parasites feeding off society, dreamers, and insignificant \"grey little people\". The writer passionately speaks of his belief that such works fall short of providing any value to the Ukrainian literature of the present, and calls for an end to such influences with the slogan, \"Death to Dostoyevskism! Up with the cultural renaissance!\"\n\nInterestingly, Khvyliovyi does not spare his own native literature from the cutting blade of his criticism. The writer bemoans the state of contemporary Ukrainian literature, which he deems devoid of the \"Faustian activist attitude\" so inherent to the \"inquisitive human spirit\" that defines European civilization. In contrast, he claims that the literature displays the symptoms of \"cultural epigonism\" and a \"servile psychology\", which ultimately gives rise to lackluster artists who do nothing but parrot what has been done before.\n\nWhat ramifications these caustic words from Khvyliovyi will have on the literary landscape remain to be seen, but it is undeniable that his fiery exhortations have lit a spark that continues to ignite fervent debate amongst both critics and enthusiasts. The question remains: will Ukrainian writers heed his call and embark on a 'cultural renaissance' as he has so passionately advocated?
ukrsoc.35.a: "Cultural Renaissance for Ukraine!"

ukrsoc.36.t: "Schools For Workers and Peasants"
ukrsoc.36.d: "With the development of education, special schools began to open in towns and villages to teach workers literacy and spelling. The schools are, of course, free of charge, and are in great demand among our working peasant population! Liknep is in full swing, and soon we will be proud to declare that Ukrainians are the most educated people in the world."
ukrsoc.36.a: "Our locomotive is moving forward!"

ukrsoc.37.t: "Foundation of the VUFKU"
ukrsoc.37.d: "The All-Ukrainian Photo-Cinema Directorate, or Fotokinoupravlinnia, was established today in Ukraine. The film organization will produce films on a regular basis, and the process will be managed by administrators of Ukrainian Soviet film production, Pavlo Nechesa and Zakhar Khelmno. Foreign filmmakers are being invited to Ukraine, and French film critic and theorist Leon Mussinac has already expressed his consent. Particular importance is given to cultural films - popular science films for education and upbringing, production films.\n\nIn addition, there are plans to increase the number of cinemas so that Ukrainian people can watch Ukrainian films in Ukrainian, in many cases absolutely free of charge. In addition, a foreign trip of chairman Skrypnyk to the French commune to establish direct cultural relations between Ukraine and France is also planned."
ukrsoc.37.a: "We expect socialist cinema to win the masses"

ukrsoc.38.t: "Silskino Displays"
ukrsoc.38.d: "The Silskino, or the Village Cinema opens in most villages of Ukraine!\nMany villages organize free screenings of the most advanced English and French as well as Ukrainian films. Thanks to this, peasants will have free access to the best achievements of socialist cinematography, completely free of charge. The screenings will be organized on weekends and will also include documentaries."
ukrsoc.38.a: "Everything to make our citizens happy"

ukrsoc.39.t: "The Poetic Bridge Connects Ukraine and France"
ukrsoc.39.d: "The renowned Ukrainian poet, Mykhailo Semenko, has recently found himself in the limelight among both Ukrainian and French literary circles. A visionary writer known for his innovative approach to form and content, Semenko has long advocated for stronger connections between nations through the bond of art and literature. In a powerful testament to this belief, a talented translator has recently brought a selection of Semenko's poetry to life in the French language, making his work accessible to a whole new audience across France.\n\nThis exchange of culture has resonated with both French and Ukrainian intelligentsia, sparking a renewed interest in each other's respective literary and artistic worlds. Semenko's poetry has particularly struck a chord within the French Commune, where leaders have been deeply touched by the beauty and depth of Ukrainian culture embodied in these verses. In response, there have been numerous ideas floated to boost cultural and educational exchanges between Ukraine and the French Commune, with the notion that a shared appreciation of literature and the arts can help strengthen ties and open new avenues of cooperation between the two nations.\n\nAs the word of this cultural blossoming spreads throughout the intellectual communities in both countries, a sense of optimism inspired by the power of language and poetry to unite nations grows stronger. It serves as a reminder of how art can transcend borders and build bridges, and how the work of individuals like Mykhailo Semenko can play a crucial role in fostering understanding and shared values on the international stage. With these closer cultural ties comes the potential for a deeper and more fruitful relationship between Ukraine and the French Commune in the years to come."
ukrsoc.39.a: "That will bring us closer to the Internationale"
ukrsoc.39.b: "Ukrainian poetry is truly beautiful!"

ukrsoc.40.t: "Road Theatre of the Communist Party"
ukrsoc.40.d: "As the winds of cultural change sweep through Ukraine under the guidance of Mykola Skrypnyk, a new milestone event has captivated the nation: the opening of the Road Theatre of the Communist Party. Drawing on the revolutionary spirit of Skrypnyk's Ukrainization policy, this groundbreaking project aims to invigorate Ukrainian arts, promote national identity, and inspire the masses.\n\nThe Road Theatre, unlike conventional performance spaces, is a mobile troupe of actors, directors, and writers, traveling from village to village, spreading the messages of Communism and Ukrainian culture. Their repertoire ranges from local folk tales to adaptations of Ukrainian literary classics, all governed by a distinct proletarian and patriotic spirit. Skrypnyk envisions the Road Theatre as a driving force for cultural unity and education, rallying the population around their shared heritage and the vision of a collective future.\n\nReception of the Road Theatre has been overwhelmingly positive, with both the urban and rural dwellers flocking to experience their unique performances. As the mobile troupe traverses the Ukrainian countryside, they not only entertain but also incite a sense of national camaraderie, successfully intertwining their art with Skrypnyk's political agenda.\n\nHistorians and cultural critics alike anticipate that this innovative theatrical movement will have a long-lasting influence on Ukrainian arts and society, serving as a shining example of the spirit of the Ukrainization process that reverberates throughout the land."
ukrsoc.40.a: "Splendid!"

ukrsoc.41.t: "Ideologisation of Education"
ukrsoc.41.d: "Along with the educational reform program and the elimination of illiteracy that has unfolded in Ukraine, education will also become ideologized. Our citizens must be educated about capitalism, the bourgeoisie, and the teachings of Marx. Through ideologization we will be able to raise a new generation of proletarians and peasants who do not think about profit."
ukrsoc.41.a: "Knowledge is Force!"

ukrsoc.42.t: "Letter of Graditude from Vietnam"
ukrsoc.42.d: "Today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a letter from ordinary peasants and workers in Vietnam who sent their thanks for our government’s help in the anti-colonial struggle of the peoples of Indochina. The Foreign Minister also expressed his deep gratitude, saying that the future belongs to internationalism and the struggle against imperialism."
ukrsoc.42.a: "Against imperialism!"

ukrsoc.43.t: "Formation of the Ivan Franko Interbrigade"
ukrsoc.43.d: "Today the first international brigade of Ukrainians, named after the great writer Ivan Franko, was fully formed and armed. The Interbrigade will help workers and peasants around the world as volunteers from socialist Ukraine."
ukrsoc.43.a: "To help the proletarians all over the globe!"

ukrsoc.44.t: "Peasant Uprisings!"
ukrsoc.44.d: "As a result of our policy of cleansing, the peasants began to actively resist. Fooled by capitalism, they are dissatisfied that our government seeks equality for the peasantry. It is likely that we will have to make some concessions to the peasants in order to put an end to their rebellions, which are growing more violent every week."
ukrsoc.44.a: "Costs of Freedom"

ukrsoc.45.t: "The New UKP Organisation"
ukrsoc.45.d: "Today at the party congress, Andriy Richytskyi announced that from now on party members must adhere to a unified party line. Despite criticism from various UKP members, including even the most prominent ones, and accusations of trying to create a cult of personality and substitute authoritarianism for the true democratic spirit of the party, the majority of delegates agreed with Richytskyi’s proposal. In the near future, it seems that we should expect an official campaign to discredit the party’s most vociferous critics."
ukrsoc.45.a: "Follow the general line of the party!"

ukrsoc.46.t: "KB 'Komsomol' Tractors"
ukrsoc.46.d: "The Constructing Bureau 'Komsomol' has presented the new designs of tractors for our peasants. As a part of state-funded mechanization of agriculture, new tractors will be issued to the peasants in several stages, achieving full mechanization of agricultural industry in a few years."
ukrsoc.46.a: "Our great achievement!"

ukrsoc.47.t: "A Record Harvest!"
ukrsoc.47.d: "Thanks to the efforts of our party and the wise leadership of the government and Prime Minister Ritchicki, this year the peasants harvested a record harvest! This is a great achievement for our breadbasket!"
ukrsoc.47.a: "Achievement of Socialism!"

ukrsoc.48.t: "Feeder of the World"
ukrsoc.48.d: "Our efforts were not in vain, and now we can proudly say that we feed the whole world with our bread! However, with such a great achievement comes a great responsibility. Now we can actually control the price of grain, and other countries will have to accept it. The right thing to do would of course be to lower the price of grain for the neediest and poorest countries. By increasing the price of grain for all, we will substantially improve the standard of living of our citizens, sending this money to social needs. At the same time, we can lower the price of grain so that there are as few needy people in the world as possible."
ukrsoc.48.a: "Raise grain prices"
ukrsoc.48.b: "Lower grain prices"
ukrsoc.48.c: "Special price for the third world countries"

ukrsoc.49.t: "Triumph of 'Chervonyi Prapor'"
ukrsoc.49.d: "Today the Central Committee of the Party officially issued a ban on nongovernmental newspapers.

"
ukrsoc.49.a: "Only governmental press is allowed!"

### ukrsoc.50-100 reserved for Kyiv Conference ###
ukrsoc.50.t: "Third Internationale & Colonial Problem"
ukrsoc.50.d: "\"The Third International, created by the forces of the syndicalist revolution in Europe, seemed to be the beginning of the World Revolution. A revolution that would free the whole world from the oppression of Imperialism and Colonialism, but what do we see? We see that the governments of socialist Europe are not ready to give an answer to the question of what the world will be like after the liberation of the colonies of world capitalism. The workers and peasants, the dehkans, the poorest people of Africa, Asia and America are in bondage, and the Third International does not give us an answer to the question of what its program on this subject will be. The hypocritical liars in Paris, London, and even Moscow say nothing about small peoples, about colonialism, about the liberation of the proletariat in the whole world, not only in Europe and North America. While the nations dream of freedom, the French government dreams of Alsace, and the socialist parties of Russia dream of restoring the empire. Our party is ready to lead the international struggle, for the liberation of the oppressed of the world. We do not divide territories, we believe that under communism every nation is worthy to remember its history and defend its culture against any globalist superculture. Down with Imperialism! Long live the free world!\""
ukrsoc.50.a: "Internationale provides no solution..."

ukrsoc.51.t: "Organisation of the Kyiv Conference"
ukrsoc.51.d: "In view of the Third Internationale’s inability to solve the colonial question and to present an effective solution to the problem, we must take it upon ourselves to organize a conference of all the powers defending or defending themselves against colonial oppression and sharing our anti-imperialist values."
ukrsoc.51.a: "Send out the invitations"

ukrsoc.52.t: "Invitation to the Kyiv Conference"
ukrsoc.52.d: "The Socialist Government of Ukraine organizes a world conference in Kyiv on international cooperation of anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist powers. We have received an official invitation from the Ukrainian Minister of Foreign Affairs"
ukrsoc.52.a: "We will attend"
ukrsoc.52.b: "What a stupid idea!"

ukrsoc.53.t: "[FROM.GetAdjective] Delegation Arrives"
ukrsoc.53.d: "The [FROM.GetName] has accepted our invitation to the Conference and their delegation has already arrived to Kyiv."
ukrsoc.53.a: "Splendid!"

ukrsoc.54.t: "Start the Conference"
ukrsoc.54.d: "With the majority of delegations arrived and gathered in Kyiv, it is high time we start our Conference. There are a lot of question to be discussed."
ukrsoc.54.a: "Most important matters should be discussed"

ukrsoc.55.t: "The Left Front Meeting"
ukrsoc.55.d: "Before the start of the main Conference, the leftist countries have gathered to discuss additional issues against colonialism. Richytskyi is willing to support the leftist more, at a cost of influencing the nations under his own vision of Communist thought. The main issue is providing extra help for the proletarians and peasants of the socialist countries, the issue to be decided on now."
ukrsoc.55.a: "So what’s on the list?"

ukrsoc.56.t: "$ukrsoc.55.t$"

ukrsoc.57.a: "Provide extra help!"

ukrsoc.58.t: "Economic Cooperation"
ukrsoc.58.d: "The first question to be discussed at the conference is the issue of the economic cooperation. Since the economic development of the countries of Asia, Africa and America is low, thanks to the Imperialist policies, it is important to install economic cooperation on the basis of mutual interest and respect for sovereignty. The member states are supposed to do collective actions to stabilise international prices and demand for resources."
ukrsoc.58.a: "Voting will soon begin..."

ukrsoc.59.t: "Cultural & Research Cooperation"
ukrsoc.59.d: "The development of the cultural cooperation is one of the most powerful measures to increase mutual understanding between our countries. Asia and Africa are the cradles of great religions and civilizations that have enriched other cultures and civilizations in the process of their own enrichment. Consequently, the cultures of Asia and Africa are based on spiritual and common foundations.\n\nMoreover, a research society should be founded in order to share technological advances in our countries."

The conference declares its full support for the principle of self-determination of peoples and nations. \n2. The Kyiv Conference condemns the policies and practices of racial segregation and discrimination, which are the basis of governmental attitudes and human relations in large parts of Africa and in other parts of the world. Such conduct is not only a gross violation of human rights, but also a denial of the basic values of civilization and human dignity. The Conference expresses its fervent sympathy and support for the courageous stand taken by the victims of racial discrimination; expresses its admiration for those who support their cause; reaffirms the determination of the peoples of Asia, Africa and America to destroy all traces of racism that may still be present in their own countries; and undertakes to use all its moral influence to guard against the danger of falling into the same evil in their struggle to eradicate racism."

ukrsoc.61.t: "Problems of the Dependent Peoples"
ukrsoc.61.d: "1. The Kyiv Conference discussed the problems of dependent peoples, colonialism, and the evils of subjecting peoples to foreign domination and exploitation. The conference agreed: (a) to declare that colonialism in all its manifestations constitutes an evil which must be speedily suppressed; (b) to affirm that the subjection of peoples to foreign subjugation, domination and exploitation constitutes a denial of fundamental human rights and an obstacle to the promotion of international peace and cooperation; (c) to support the cause of freedom and independence of all such peoples; (1) to call upon the countries concerned to grant freedom and independence to such peoples.\n2. In view of the unsettled situation in North Africa and the persistent denial of the right of the peoples of North Africa to self-determination, the Kyiv Conference expresses its support for the rights of the peoples of Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia to self-determination and independence, and calls upon the French Government to achieve without delay a peaceful settlement of the matter."

ukrsoc.62.t: "Kyiv Conference Demands"
ukrsoc.62.d: "We have received a note of protest from the countries, that gathered at the Kyiv Conference about our 'exploitation of the dependent peoples in North Africa'. They have demanded that we should immediately give them independence and withdraw from their rightful lands."

### Other UKP Non-sorted ###

ukrsoc.101.t: "Discrediting Shakhrai Campaign"
ukrsoc.101.d: "Due to the ban on factionalism in the party, one of the Ukapist leaders, Vasyl Shakhrai, soon fell under a campaign of discredit. He was accused of revisionism, imperialism, and collaboration with the opposition parties of the Socialist Revolutionaries and the Social Democrats. In addition, he was also attributed ties with Shumskyi. Shakhrai is no longer mentioned in the press, and his merits are greatly diminished. Moreover, he ceased to be published in Chervonyi Prapor, the main newspaper of the UKP."
ukrsoc.101.a: "Can’t believe he was once our leader!"

ukrsoc.102.t: "The King of Futuroprairies"
ukrsoc.102.d: "Extremely popular among Ukrainians, the futurists challenge all Russian-speaking futurists who imagine themselves as judges and leaders.\n\nIn their vital escapade, Shkurupyi and Semenko wittily appropriated motifs from popular adventure novels (Mein Ried, Fenimore Cooper, Gustave Emar), threatening to scalp the capital’s \"literary generals\" of futurism - thus trying on themselves the role of Ukrainian Indians who rebelled against Russian authorities. It should be noted that on the cover and title page of his first poetry collection "Psychetozy: Vitryna tretia" (Kyiv, 1922) the 19-year-old author attested himself: THE KING OF FUTUROPRAIRIES GEO SHKURUPYI."
ukrsoc.102.a: " Ukraine’s young talents are our pride."

ukrsoc.103.t: "Coalition With UPSR"
ukrsoc.103.d: "The UPSR leadership reacted quite optimistically to the invitation to join the coalition. In addition to being the largest party in the country and having enormous support among the peasantry, their inclusion in the government would also accelerate the land reform planned under the SR’s program of land socialization.\n\nShakhrai warmly welcomed the UPSR delegates to today’s meeting in the government and said that the key to the friendship of the socialist parties is the success of the future of the Ukrainian peasantry and proletariat."
ukrsoc.103.a: "The Left Coalition Forms!"

ukrsoc.104.t: "The Second Largest Party"
ukrsoc.104.d: "Despite our majority, the Borotbyst Party, led by Oleksandr Shumskyi, is still the second largest party in the country after the UPSR. Shumskyi is an extremely outstanding revolutionary and will be ready to lead the crowd. By demonstratively boycotting the All-Ukrainian Congress, we have lost many voices of the Ukrainian people who are ready to take up arms for the triumph of the Borotbysts. \n\nHowever, the Ukapists and the Borotbysts have much in common, and Shumskyi would obviously benefit from becoming our ally. In this connection, Shakhrai addressed an official letter to Shumskyi and an invitation to take the position of minister without portfolio. In addition, we invited the borotbyst to join the left-wing coalition of socialist parties. This offer is very advantageous for Shumskyi, who can join our socialist cabinet painlessly and peacefully."
ukrsoc.104.a: "Let us await for his answer..."

ukrsoc.105.t: "Shumskyi Joins the Coalition"
ukrsoc.105.d: "Today, after the government meeting, Shakhrai returned to his office, where Minister of Agriculture and one of the leaders of the Ukapists, Antin Drahomyretskyi, was waiting for him.\nShumskyi and his representatives, who had jouned a coalition with the Ukapists during the session, were present at the government session for the first time. \n\nShakhrai and Drahomyretskyi discussed some pressing issues and prepared a plan for land reform - in fact, repeating Lenin’s decree on land, that is - the SRs’ Socialization of Land, but later there was a talk of the Borotbysts’ participation in the work of the government.\nDrahomyretskyi only took off his glasses, looked at the prime minister and said:"
ukrsoc.105.a: "\"In my opinion it was obvious that he would agree.\""

ukrsoc.106.t: "The 'Molot' Newspaper"
ukrsoc.106.d: "Today the first issue of the new government newspaper, the \"Hammer\" or the \"Molot\", came out. In fact, the paper is all propaganda for the Ukapists and their achievements and promises. In addition, the paper also contains criticism of other Reds, mainly of the Borotbysts and the national-traitors of the \"Ukrainian\" Bolsheviks who are abroad.\n\nAlthough people are generally happy with the paper, there are those who have begun to criticize Shakhrai for being authoritarian and propagandizing his ideas. On the other hand, this is not a crime, is it?"
ukrsoc.106.a: "The new mouthpiece of communism!"

ukrsoc.107.t: "Shift in Mass Perceptions"
ukrsoc.107.d: "With the entry of the Borotbysts into the coalition and their regular criticism in the 'Molot', the masses began to drift away from Shumskyi’s influence. Recently, in the local Radas, more and more former Borotbyst supporters openly referred to themselves as Ukapists. It is quite expected that the Ukapists will have a clear majority in the next local council elections. \n\nIt is unknown how Shumskyi himself will react to this, but the main thing is that the masses are coming over to our side, strengthening our united socialist front and bringing Ukraine closer to communism."
ukrsoc.107.a: "Towards victory!"

ukrsoc.108.t: "Decree On Land"
ukrsoc.108.d: "Today, after months and even years of waiting, Ukrainian peasants are free masters of their land. Thanks to a government decree on the socialization of landed estates and their transfer to local land councils, there will be no more inequality in Ukraine. \n\nPeasants! Chase away the capitalists, landlords, bourgeoisie, and foreign gentry. From now on, you will dispose of your land yourselves"
ukrsoc.108.a: "Final liberation of peasants!"

ukrsoc.109.t: "Ukrainian Marxist Congress"
ukrsoc.109.d: "The members of the UKP and the USDRP gave the green light for the Marxist Congress. Today, in Kyiv there will be the first congress of Ukrainian marxists. Nothing will be decided on this event, it has only advisory role, but this kind of cooperation is still highly symbolic. Main invitations were sent to the prominent members of UKP and USDRP, as well as their youth wings. Members of other coalition parties were invited too — but not in that scale. It was a marxist event, and a really important one. With speeches, discussions, ecen fights, the people grew united. The left of the UKP and the Right of USDRP cannot stand each other and either tried to ignore, or, opposite, engage in all the discussions. \n\nAfter all, the congress mood was decided by the youth wings, who pushed a statement, noncommital one, but still powerful, which proclaimed: \"The worker’s parties of the UKP and USDRP are looking forward to closest cooperation of all socialist forces against reaction, capitalism and all forms of imperialism brickering. In this regard, such conferences should continue, widening its base to other socialist parties, striving for uniting a revolutionary democracy in one struggle — a class struggle against the rulling classes and for the victory of world revolution\". While for the Right wing presented such speech was wishful thinking, and for the left — a compromise with petit-bourgoise, but for the most people it was a start."
ukrsoc.109.a: "Interesting"

ukrsoc.110.t: "Advisory Center of Revolutionary Democracy"
ukrsoc.110.d: "The complete unification of revolutionary parties appeared to be a mere idealistic thought than a reality. Such unification threatened a split — and even in the form of UKP-USDRP unification, serious obstacles appeared, mostly from the right and the left of the parties, which practically sabotaged such process. But it wasnt useless nonetheless. A proposal seems to passed through the coalition’s parties — creation of the so-called \"advisory center of revolutionary democracy\" — an elected group of representatives of all the coalition parties, practically powerless and only formal, but at the same time being a collective organ beyond all the individual parties — as a show of commitment to the coalition. Such center could be looked at as some, very vague form of confederative party unification and used for coordination of revolutionary actions. If created, it could be the first step for the one and only Ukrainian Socialist Party."
ukrsoc.110.a: "Approve the formation of such center"
ukrsoc.110.b: "Block it. UKP should not be united with petty-bourgouise philisters!"

ukrsoc.111.t: "Close Ties With Bolsheviks"
ukrsoc.111.d.nsp: "Even though the government in power in Russia is trying to distance itself from the fact that they are Bolsheviks, it does not change that fact. Nikolai Bukharin, in many ways the more democratic proponent of socialism and propagandist of his model of market socialism, is in fact the very real Bolshevik and a longtime acquaintance of Skrypnyk.\n\nIn this connection, the government today sent a delegation to Soviet Russia with the hope of concluding a friendly alliance on independent terms. "
ukrsoc.111.d: "The Socialist Revolution has triumphed in Russia and the Bolsheviks, led by [RUS.GetLeader], are once again in the forefront of Soviet Russian politics. As longtime acquaintances of the Russian leader, Skrypnyk would be happy to strike a lucrative deal.\n\nIn this connection, the government today sent a delegation to Soviet Russia with the hope of concluding a friendly alliance on independent terms.

ukrsoc.112.a: "Ukraine shall be our valuable ally!"

ukrsoc.114.t: "Russia Suggest Autonomy"
ukrsoc.114.d: "Russia has agreed to sign the treaty of mutual cooperation and close ties, but they only demanded that we should become a Soviet Republic with limited autonomy"
ukrsoc.114.a: "Are they crazy?"

ukrsoc.115.t: "Russia Refused!"
ukrsoc.115.d: "Despite close relations between our leaders, it seems that Russia follows a bit different policy, if talking about Ukrainian independence. With stupid accusation of nationalism, the Russian government has refused any cooperation."
ukrsoc.115.a: "Why I am not surprised?"

ukrsoc.116.t: "A Resolute Rejection From Ukraine"
ukrsoc.116.d: "The Ukrainian government has resolutely rejected our offer to make them our autonomy."
ukrsoc.116.a: "We should get ready for war."

ukrsoc.117.t: "Federative Treaty with Russia?"
ukrsoc.117.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader] has claimed that he is up to sign a federative treaty with Russia, making two our countries equal members of a single union - a single socialist federation."

ukrsoc.119.a: "Hooray!"

ukrsoc.120.t: "Delegation From Ukraine"
ukrsoc.120.d: "The new socialist government in Ukraine has sent a delegation to Paris. They have visited our Foreign minister in order to discuss Ukraine’s place in the Internationale as well as investments. Having Ukraine in our alliance means influencing all of Eastern Europe. While Ukraine is a valuable ally, we should also be aware of Russian ambitions in the region."
ukrsoc.120.a: "Welcome them!"

ukrsoc.121.t: "A Coalition for Ukraine's Future"
ukrsoc.121.d: "Amidst these turbulent times of ever-changing political landscape of Ukraine, Mykola Skrypnyk, the steadfast leader of our Republic, senses an urgent need for internal unity. Fully aware that a strong, unified government is crucial to the survival and prosperity of his nation, Skrypnyk extends an olive branch to Oleksandr Shumskyi, a formidable Borotbyst opposition revolutionary.\n\nDespite the wide ideological chasm separating them, Skrypnyk hopes that the shared desire to ensure a flourishing future for Ukraine can mend political divisions and foster strong alliances. As these two political titans engage in tense negotiations, the country now stands at a crossroads: will they succeed in creating a united front, thereby strengthening their position on the global stage, or will these critical talks merely serve to intensify underlying tensions?"
ukrsoc.121.a: "Decision should be made"

ukrsoc.122.d: "Mykola Skrypnyk and Oleksandr Shumskyi have reached an unprecedented agreement, successfully forging a united government that stands strong against the turmoil. This monumental alliance shall drastically increase national unity, stability, and the popularity of both leaders. With newfound solidarity, Ukraine is poised to become a formidable power in the Internationale."
ukrsoc.122.d2: "Skrypnyk and Shumskyi’s negotiations yield a precarious and brittle coalition, fraught with an undercurrent of tension threatening to unravel the delicate balance. While there is potential for achieving increased unity and stability, the fragility of this alliance might lead to future internal conflicts spurred by ideological differences and political ambition."
ukrsoc.122.a: "Long live the UKP-UPSR(b) Front!"

ukrsoc.123.t: "A Country Divided"
ukrsoc.123.d: "Despite Skrypnyk's best efforts, the negotiations with Borotbysts fail to bridge the ideological divide, ultimately leaving the political landscape of Ukraine unchanged. The dream of a unified government seems far-fetched, and internal strife persists. Very disappointed about the land reform and current state of affairs in the agricultural industry, Shumskyi refuses to cooperate with what he called a 'Bolshevist' regime of ours.\n\nA dark cloud of uncertainty hangs over the nation as its leaders continue to lock horns over divergent visions for their beloved country."
ukrsoc.123.a: "Damned Borotbysts!"

### USDRP events ###

ukrsoc.124.t: "The Land Issue"
ukrsoc.124.d: "The issue of land reform is one of the hottest topics of discussion at the Party Congress. Moreover, the options for resolving this problem are plentiful, but delegates have not yet been able to agree.\n\nThe Centrists’ plan is the municipalization of land, which implies the transfer of land into the hands of local councils, which will then distribute it among the peasants. \n\nThere is also a proposal to divide the land according to 'who can cultivate how much' and the same division, but with a declared minimum of 50 hectares. Smaller lands would have to be divided among the peasants.\n\nThe left faction advocated a Narodnik land reform - that is, its socialization, transferring it into the hands of all the Ukrainian peasants. Large farms are to be preserved and production cooperatives to be created on their basis.\n\nSo far, the final choice has not been made, but by the end of the week the Central Committee of the USDRP intends to make a final decision..."

This situation is not preferable for the majority of the USDRP Central Committee, who see Petliura as a warmonger and a careerist. Dissatisfaction with Petliura has already reached such a stage that the Central Committee is ready to vote to expel him from the party, but some have spoken out against such a decision and suggest that he simply be relegated to a second echelon of politics by removing him from office. With a slight majority, the Central Committee votes for..."

ukrsoc.1250.d: "Some people have reported to other certain people that more than 140 attempts have been made on General Petliura's life and health in the last few months, but none of them have been successful. Each time, almost miraculously, the general was completely unharmed and unscathed. \n\nAlthough we might suspect some people of unprofessionalism, we can be certain that they are experts in their field. In turn, some people have applied for additional funding for their highly secretive activities, but we have the final word."
ukrsoc.1250.a: "Increase funding!"
ukrsoc.1250.b: "They should just try better!"

ukrsoc.1251.t: "Planning the Accident"
ukrsoc.1251.d: "In a fairly ordinary apartment not far from the center of Kyiv, some citizens were sitting around and were clearly up to something. If the neighbor had been nosy enough, he probably, with the proper dexterity, could have overheard the conversation. And some people were talking about the following: how to kill General Petliura. To kill him so that he would not die. More precisely, how to plan the accident in such a way that the general would stay alive? Creating an appearance of work and deep conversation, for several days and nights some people had been planning how to commit murder without committing murder so that they would not be suspected of it. On the table a fair amount of Hryvnias were lying, received from important people, noticeably smaller than it had been in that very briefcase at the Ministry...\n\nThe answer was still not forthcoming, but surely it had already matured in the mind of one of the 'some men' and would soon be announced..."
ukrsoc.1251.a: "Hopefully they will find the answer eventually"

ukrsoc.126.t: "Subordinating the Army"
ukrsoc.126.d: "Even after the previous decision, Petliura stays as the Otaman of the Army, and so the dissatisfaction with our government in the UNR Army and among the General Staff increased greatly.\n\nSome of the USDRP members suggest that Petliura should retire from Army - the decision, which is supported by the majority of the Central Committee. However, the leftists see the whole Petliurivtsi faction as dangerous for democracy and suggest to dismiss them all.\n\nThe Central Committee should make its decision till the end of the day."

However, different factions had a different approach to this.\n\nThus, the leftists propose to nationalize everything in general - the abolition of private property, especially the alienation from the landlords and the bourgeoisie of the sources of their capital is seen as obligatory and immutable. However, this would cause great unrest in the Western powers, especially in Germany and Austria.\n\nThe centrists have taken a more moderate position, proposing that all enterprises and productions owned by Ukrainians should be left in private hands, including the medium-sized industry, and that foreign companies should be nationalized in exchange for concessions. \n\nThe rightists, on the other hand, are ready to compromise and leave some areas in private hands, especially where state control may be ineffective, such as small businesses, which are supposed to be taxed."

ukrsoc.138.d: "The Ukrainian Social Democratic Party professes the ideal of national cultural-personal autonomy. First formulated by Otto Bauer in 1907, it remains the prevailing ethnic policy of the Austro-Marxist movement, from which the USDRP borrows most of its ideas - it seeks to turn the nation not into a territorial and ethnic entity, but into a simple association of people, separating the state from its territory. After all, what does it say about being Ukrainian that you have to live in this particular section of Europe and follow a certain set of traditions? If you consider yourself Ukrainian, have Ukrainian citizenship, and contribute to the country - through taxes or other means - what prevents you from being considered Ukrainian?\n\nMany Jewish Bundist ideologues held a similar view, which turned the Social Democrats and the Bundists into natural allies. During its term, the Social Democrat government would seek significant reforms to achieve its ideal of National Cultural and Personal Autonomy. Every ethnic group in Ukraine would have their own universal cultural assemblies, able to levy their own taxes and autonomously decide matters concerning their members. Every citizen of Ukraine would belong to one of these cultural assemblies, but the question of which national movement to join would be a matter of personal choice, and no government would control the decision."

These autonomous ethnic communities could levy their own taxes, create their own educational programs, and, of course, elect their own leadership.\n\nToday, the cultural autonomy of Ukrainian Jews holds elections. Although outwardly dominated by the Jewish Workers’ Bund (in alliance with the USDRP) and its electoral lists, the Jewish community of Ukraine is very ideologically diverse, and although socialism is prominent among them, the Achdus religious party has suddenly gained an advantage in a number of polls.

These autonomous ethnic communities could levy their own taxes, create their own educational programs, and, of course, elect their own leadership.\n\nToday, the cultural autonomy of Crimean Tatars holds elections. With Crimean separatism still quite active, the Kemalist faction of the Milliy Fırqa, the main and only Crimean Tatar party struggles to win against the leftist faction. However, they still have a chance due to the split in the main Crimean Tatar party: two candidates are struggling for victory. The first is Asan Sabri Ayvazov, an ideologue and one of the leaders of the Crimean Tatar people in the initial period of the Civil War.\nThe second is Amet Ozenbashly, a candidate with a socialist bias in his views. He participated in the negotiations between the government of Sulkevich and the Hetman in 1918, and then did not emigrate and in 1920 became one of the founders of the agricultural organization "Shirket", which had branches in all regions of the Crimea. In addition, he became a member of the organization "Koch Yardim" ("Assistance to migrants"), which aimed to create favorable conditions for the return of Crimean Tatars from Turkey and the Bulgarian Tsardom."

Some of the most popular and widespread ones are the \"Social-Democratic Labour Party of the Crimean Tatars\" and \"Party of Ukrainian Romy\". While some deputies of the Rada claim that the local representation in the government and parliament is not enough, this is not the main case of the national-personal autonomies.\n\nHowever, the government is now faced with several decisions to make: either establish a 'Confederation' of Social-Democratic parties in Ukraine, which will likely include the Jewish Bund, invite Roma and Crimean Tatar social-democrats in the ruling coalition, or just simply leave everything as it is for the sake of socialist democracy."

This has not been helped by period of Russification and other such attempts to strip our nation of it’s uniqueness. This shall stand no longer! Under the people’s government, our culture will thrive. Be it promotion of events featuring famous works of art, state sponsored food expos, or funding the arts in general, we shall not rest until Ukraine’s culture is revived! While this may draw the ire of Russiphiles in the East and the Poles in the west, we know our cause is just.

Although the Bundas are trade unions, they are being organised by Jews, and for Jews alone. While the left generally approve of the Bundas autonomy, the rightists believe that a central trade union under joint USDRP-Bund authority should be created. This will help us to get our parties closer to each other and prevent any misunderstandings with the local Bundas."

It was Hetman’s Minister of Finance Rzhepetskyi who was one of the \"architects\" of the Derzhavnyi Bank in its present form.\n\nWith the coming of the Dyrektoria to power, the Derzhavnyi Bank proved to be a strong body, which could control private banks and cooperation, and in fact attach them to itself at the expense of lending activities.\n\nNow many banks are still private and in the hands of capitalists, especially the cooperative banks, which are engaged in credit activities for farmers and peasants. Nevertheless, we can use the Derzhavnyi Bank to increase control over private banks. In fact, the government proposes to nationalize the banks - but to give them directly to the Derzhavnyi Bank."

ukrsoc.144.d: "Due to the recent nationalization of Banks, the Poltava Village Cooperative Bank claimed its bankruptcy, leaving about a thousand depositors without their money. Spontaneous protests by deceived depositors emerged, who blamed the repressive impact of the Derzhavnyi Bank, which set a high interest rate for credit loans. Local Poltava councils have already stated the need to support depositors, and have asked the government directly to address the situation and subsidize farms and khutors in Poltavshchyna.\n\nThe government’s response has not yet been received, but it is clear to many that the Derzhavnyi Bank needs to be restricted, and probably set a maximum interest rate."

ukrsoc.145.t: "Fight For Kherson"
ukrsoc.145.d: "After strengthening the power of municipal councils, it was decided to hold new elections in Kherson. The rural region faced an almost deadlocked situation for the first time: the traditional majority of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the relatively recent coalition of the USDRP-leftists and Ukapists were fighting head-to-head for the Kherson Local Rada. \n\nDespite the great support for the Socialist-Revolutionaries, Kherson has recently begun to develop actively, and industrialization has begun in the city, which has caused a sharp influx of the working population.\n\nAccording to pre-election polls, the coalition of the UKP and the leftists of the USDRP has caught up with the SRs in less than 2 months and now they are keeping up. The results of these elections will probably change not only Kherson, but the entire surrounding region."

ukrsoc.146.d: "Yesterday many Ukrainian newspapers carried an interesting news item with a headline about possible negotiations between the ruling Social Democrats and the Ukapists. The new course adopted by the USDRP brought them closer to former co-partisans who had left the party as a result of a split 20 years earlier. \n\nWhile many were wondering whether the rumors were the real facts or another conjecture of imaginative journalists, the Rada of People’s Ministers announced the appointment of Ukapist ministers to a number of posts."

ukrsoc.147.t: "USDRP-UKP Coalition Announced!"
ukrsoc.147.d: "The USDRP and the UKP have worked together a great deal recently, despite the absence of an official coalition. In some local council elections, the Ukapists preferred to unite with the leftist USDRP in a single electoral bloc and successfully won seats in this way. \n\nToday, during a speech in parliament, the leader of the Ukapists, Vasyl Shakhrai, announced that a coalition government would be formed and that his party would enter parliament on an official basis. Thus, one of the prominent UKP members, Mykhailo Tkachenko, was appointed as the new Minister of Internal Affairs. \n\nThe changes in the government caused a mixed reaction among some members of the USDRP, especially right-wing members, who condemned the decision of the Central Committee and the government. There were even claims that the USDRP had finally descended into Bolshevism."
ukrsoc.147.a: "Ukrainian Social-Democrats unite once again."

ukrsoc.148.t: "A Single Party?"
ukrsoc.148.d: "After the announcement of the official coalition between the Social Democrats and the Ukapists, the parties became even closer to each other. Their fundamental differences that had led to the splits were now less significant, and so there was talk among high-ranking officials of uniting the two parties - or rather, of reuniting them.\n\nDespite the fact that unification would in no way change the current state of affairs, the USDRP should expect a split from the other side - from the right-wing Social Democrats, who are very negative about the prospect of becoming a single party with the former 'Nezalezhniki'.\n\nThe fundamental question now is the name of the future party. On the one hand, the Social Democrats insist on retaining the current name with the prefix 'united' - to show the essence of the new party. On the other hand, the Ukapists insist that the new party be called the UKP, in honor of our intentions and ultimate goal."
ukrsoc.148.a: "USDRP(o) - don’t forget who we are."

ukrsoc.149.t: "Another Split?"
ukrsoc.149.d: "The unification of the USDRP with the Ukapists caused a number of problems within the new party. Politicians from among the \"right-wing\" Social-Democrats reacted negatively not only to the merger but also to the new name of the party. At first this fundamental contradiction was suppressed by speeches and convictions about party unity, but toward the end the influence of the Left became too strong. \n\nConsequently, a number of politicians announced their withdrawal from the party and announced an opposition coalition to the new government. Their main partner in this endeavor was the ULD(S-F). The opposition stated that the new course of Ukraine would lead the country to ruin and called on the other parties to join them and change the government democratically."

It also involves the use of modern and even experimental technologies.\n\nThe city’s new plans radically increase spending on cultural spaces, architecture, public transportation, and parks, but everything comes at a price. This massive budgetary pressure will not go unnoticed - it requires tax increases for peasants and budget cuts for other regions, which is sure to anger many."

ukrsoc.151.d: "The vision between Red Kyiv is a modern and radical one of the misto-sad, a city which mends the schism between citizens and nature and to this, Kyiv aspires to be the new city never seen before. Financing green projects became an important part of the Red Kyiv project — with even Vynnychenko lobbying for “naturalization” of the city to realize his concordist vision — of people harmonized with nature. New parks. lakes, green roofs, vineyards hanging on the streets, Kyiv ressembles a city of futurism.\n\nMunicipality of the city put in a lot of work to make this vision a reality, but such projects appeared to be too ambitious for the city to hold in normal conditions. In serious discussion, the city council decided to announce a referendum about labour mobilizations — as it is the only way for the plan to be done without overextending the budget. While the population seems rather optimistic and is ready to work harder than ever before, such an approach sparks a lot of controversies in the city council..."

After the revolution, optimistic peasants showed the immense rise of productivity and were the main forces for Ukrainian modernisation. But now all of this hard work did not return to farms and villages — but in Kyiv. Such regional exceptionality moved the peasants in the opposition and forced UPSR to adopt harsher stances to our government. The first peasant strike from the time of revolution, and a really dangerous one — if we won’t do something, Kyiv will see famine and shortages..."

ukrsoc.153.d: "Soon after the strengthening of the powers of municipal councils, many regions of the country began to prepare for local elections. The most active election campaign was inextricably linked with the capital of our republic - the city of Kyiv. In the first years of the UNR, the head of the city was lawyer Riabtsov Yevhen from the Socialist Revolutionary Party, until he was removed from his post by the Hetman government, which put Karl Marshalk, in his place.\n\nWhen the Dyrektoria came to power, the Kyiv Rada was dissolved until the All-Ukrainian Congress was convened. Now the right to govern the city is being fought over again - and this time, the contender for the position of Kyiv mayor is Volodymyr Chekhivskyi, a native of Kyiv Governorate, and together with his team of SDs is ready to radically transform the city, making it the proletarian capital of Europe. \n\nThe capital was greeted with a resounding victory for the Social Democrats - with an almost 40-percent margin, Chekhivskyi’s bloc came out on top, taking an honorable majority in the local council. Now the city was under the rule of the USDRP, and modernization, greening, and other ambitious projects awaited it."

As Vynnychenko said once: “If Freud knew about Concordism, he should have immediately become a member of social-democratic party”. To be at the helm of marxist, socialist and psychoanalytical discussions, first “Freudo-marxist studies” were established. However, not limited to Freud and Marx, they gave a new framework for combining social liberation with psychological and individual one.\n\nNew studies gathered psychoanalytics and theoretics around the world, and all the people around the world, especially from Third Internationale countries visiting the city to listen to such people as Otto Fenichel, Wilhelm Reich and Erich Fromm to give birth of what would be called as “Kyiv school of psychoanalysis”"

ukrsoc.156.d.right: "“Ukrainian People’s Republic, republic of its citizens, wealthy and rich, wholy belongs to the people” After the elections to the Constitutional Congress it finally stands ready to draw a new Constitution. The USDRP decided to align itself in the narrow coalition with ULD, agreeing to a number of compromises, and got only a narrow majority in Congress. The Constitutional body elects two heads to lead it to write a new future for Ukraine...\n\nAfter the short vote, with long standing ovations, Panas Fedenko from Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party and Volodymyr Vynnychenko from Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party, backed by UPSR and ULD prepared to start the work on the awaited constitution. The new Constitution will guarantee long awaited freedom for everyone, of all persons of any class and race. Panas Fedenko in its speech, promises a ‘neutral Constitution’ that will ensure equality before law, people’s power and will take a class war in parliament rather than on the streets, where candidates will fight for their visions.

ukrsoc.157.t: "Concordism"
ukrsoc.157.d: "Concordism is a socio-ethical concept aimed at restoring the balance of the inner world of man, harmony between man and society and between man and nature. Etymologically, Concordia is ancient Roman. the deity of harmony among the citizens and between the people and the senate.  The concept of Concordism is laid out in philosophical and ethical treatises of V. Vynnychenko. Vynnychenko makes an attempt to explain how to overcome obstacles on the way to reach people's dreams and happiness. \n\nConcordism is a system of methods and rules for the achievement of happiness, the pursuit of which unites all people.\nThe concept focuses on restoring coherence (balance) internally in the world of man using the system of personal, cooperative and global means (from nutrition and valeology to spiritual self-improvement). Humanity has always suffered from "disconcordism" - drama of inconsistency among themselves, which is "a deadly disease that destroys a person." \nVynnychenko emphasizes the need for adequate. awareness of the relationship between man and nature. Man is not the conqueror and master of nature, but only its fragment. \nNature as a whole and the perfect world is contrasted with disharmony of people. The Concordist paradigm focuses on treating nature not as a passive background on which people's lives take place but, as a component of a person's life, as an organism, an element of which is also a person, who must realize his own vital functions, without violating the basic function of the whole organism. In order to achieve such a state, the author promoted such a philosophical approach of "being honest with yourself". The concept of Concordism of V. Vynnychenko can also be productive for the formation of the ecological culture of a contemporary, didactics of environmental education and methods of ecological education, cooperative livelihood and socialism. Philosophy of Concordism has close parallels with teaching of Nietzsche and Freud, which become an important part of Ukrainian openness to new and arising studies of psychoanalysis."

ukrsoc.158.t: "Legacy of Drahomaniv"
ukrsoc.158.d: "Mykhailo Drahomaniv occupies an honorable place in the history of Ukrainian socialism and the labor movement. In many ways he became one of the founders of the movement for Ukrainian autonomism, because he believed that salvation for Ukrainians lies in the creation of their own state, the Union for the defense of themselves against outsiders. He also made a great contribution to the ideological basis of the USDRP - federalism, the basis of which is local self-government, as well as seriously defended the principles of political rights and human freedoms. \n\nDrahomaniv is remembered and loved in Ukraine and his legacy will live on. Renaming of a number of streets in many cities of Ukraine, including Kyiv, has already begun in his honor."
ukrsoc.158.a: "Great patriot of Ukraine!"

ukrsoc.159.t: "Vynnychenko - Is It Too Far?"
ukrsoc.159.d: "Within the broader context of the Concordist movement, a controversial aspect of Volodymyr Vynnychenko's philosophy emerges—the promotion of nudism as a means of personal liberation and societal transformation.\nVynnychenko's advocacy for nudism stems from the belief that the human body should be liberated from the constraints of societal norms and puritanical attitudes. He argues that the human form, free from clothing, symbolizes a return to nature, self-acceptance, and an expression of personal freedom. Nudism, in his view, is a manifestation of the rejection of oppressive social structures and the embrace of a new, more liberated society.\n\nThe cultural revolution surrounding Vynnychenko's nudism begins to take shape across Ukraine. Nudist colonies and clubs emerge, attracting individuals who embrace the ideology of body liberation. These spaces become havens for like-minded individuals seeking a sense of community and personal liberation, where they can engage in recreational activities, exercise, and leisure in a clothing-optional environment.\nAs news of the nudist movement spreads, the Ukrainian government faces a dilemma. On one hand, there are those who argue that personal freedoms and the rejection of societal taboos should be embraced in the spirit of Concordism. They view nudism as a form of self-expression and a means to challenge the oppressive norms of the past. On the other hand, critics argue that public nudity could be seen as indecent or offensive, potentially undermining the broader goals of social unity and stability.\n\nThe government is faced with a decision: Should it embrace and regulate the nudist movement, seeking to find a balance between personal freedom and societal norms? Or should it take a more cautious approach, fearing potential backlash and the risk of alienating more conservative factions within society?"

ukrsoc.160.t: "Women Movement Grows Stronger"
ukrsoc.160.d: "The socialist-feminist legacy of Lesya Ukrainka, a prominent Ukrainian writer and activist, continues to resonate as a powerful force in the struggle for gender equality and social justice. Lesya Ukrainka, born in 1871, was a visionary and an ardent advocate for women's rights and the principles of socialism. Her writings, speeches, and activism played a pivotal role in challenging societal norms, inspiring generations of feminists, and shaping the trajectory of Ukrainian society.\n\nLesya Ukrainka's works exude a profound sense of social consciousness and explore themes of gender inequality, class struggle, and national liberation. Through her poetry, plays, and prose, she delved into the struggles faced by women in a patriarchal society, highlighting their oppression and calling for their empowerment. Her literary works captured the essence of the socialist-feminist movement, blending the quest for gender equality with the broader struggle for social transformation and liberation.\nAs a socialist and a feminist, Lesya Ukrainka firmly believed in the intersectionality of oppressions. She recognized that the struggle for gender equality could not be divorced from the fight against class exploitation and national oppression. Her activism extended beyond gender issues, advocating for the rights of workers, peasants, and oppressed national minorities. By linking feminism with socialism, she sought to create a more inclusive and just society where all marginalized groups could find liberation.\nLesya Ukrainka's legacy extends beyond her writings. She actively engaged in public discourse, delivering speeches and participating in political discussions that challenged traditional gender roles and promoted the ideals of gender equality and social justice. Her commitment to women's rights and the principles of socialism inspired many to join the fight for a more equitable society.\nLesya Ukrainka was one of the creators of the first Ukrainian social-democratic organization, tying ideas of feminism, Marxism and Drahomanovism together. And now, when the social-democratic revolution came, she shreds the light on our further progress."

ukrsoc.161.t: "Hrushevskyi's Long-Awaited Speech"
ukrsoc.161.d: "Hrushevskyi, one of the most important persons of Ukrainian revolution in 1917 — respected among most of Ukrainians as a father figure for the whole Ukrainian movement, and hated by the nationalists for alleged mismanagement and ‘too democratic’ way of governance. Now, history gives its most passionate actor, the historian himself, a second chance. Again, as ten years before, Hrushevskyi stands among the hundreds of thousand people, waving Ukrainian and red flags...\n\nTo the people of Ukraine, a nation of free, on the land of free, revolutionary greetings! To all the brave heroes, who died fighting for freedom and liberty, we are now standing, united and free! Not tsarist chains, german bayonets or Hetman’s police broke us! Today, the republic stands firmly. With laboring peoples standing and its helm — and first, from 1917, ready to decide their destiny! From now on, Ukraine will be free from landlords, dictators and tsars — either German, Austrian or Russian, with the trust of people backing the UPSR. We are announcing the start of realization of our program, and the most important, land reform.\nLong applause and shouting were heard all over the street. Hope was reborn in the people, and for days after everyone was waiting — will the government deliver on their promises? Is Ukraine really free, is it really, a reality? Even skeptical nationalists were moved by mass support given for Hrushevskyi and UPSR and limited their criticism for a time. Now, everyone was waiting, what would happen next."
ukrsoc.161.a: "Have you heard already a brilliant speech of Hrushevskyi?"

ukrsoc.162.t: "Selianska Spilka Restored"
ukrsoc.162.d: "The spread of the idea of organizing peasant unions in the depths of the \"old\" Ukrainian lands, as well as the rise of the national movement, in particular the creation of the Ukrainska Selianska spilka (Ukrainian peasant union), contributed radically to national and class organization of Ukrainian people. On the territory of the Kyiv, Poltava and Podillia provinces, where the absolute dominance of the Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries was observed, There was an intensive process of formation of local branches of the Ukrainian Peasant Union, an alternative to the All-Russian Peasant Union.\n\nThe Peasants' Union demanded from the Ukrainian Central Council the abolition of private ownership of land and its transfer to the ownership of the people; it did not recognize the hetman's power. The 2nd All-Ukrainian Peasants' Congress convened by the Peasants' Union took place on May 21-23, 1918, secretly in the Holosiiv Forest near Kyiv;\nIt protested against German interference in Ukrainian affairs, declared its loyalty to the Ukrainian People's Republic, and called on the peasantry to fight against the Hetmanate. After the division of the UPSR (May 15, 1918), the Peasants' Union, unlike the Borotbysts, found itself aligned to the \"central current\" of the UPSR under the leadership of N. Hryhoriyev. After years of repressions by the Hetman, Spilka wasn't destroyed and was always the force to be reckoned with. Even with Hetman’s support of landowners and police raids to the gatherings of Spilka, its organizations organized illegal activities and leaders went to exile, participating in creation of Directoria — a revolutionary republican coalition.\n\nNow it's time to recreate and legalize Selianska Spilka, elect its leadership and renew its participation in governance and politics of the newly found Ukrainian People’s Republic."

ukrsoc.163.d: "Recognizing the significance of agrarian issues, the UPSR champions a land reform agenda that aims to empower the rural masses. Under this proposal, land would be redistributed to farmers and peasants, ensuring fair access and fostering agricultural productivity. The UPSR emphasizes the importance of collective ownership and cooperative farming practices to maximize the benefits for all.\n\nIn their quest for social justice, the UPSR advocates for comprehensive labor rights reforms. They aim to protect workers from exploitation, ensure fair wages, and establish safe working conditions. The party calls for the establishment of labor unions, collective bargaining rights, and the implementation of social welfare programs to provide support for workers and their families and in the end, socialization of the majority of factories for worker’s control in their first term. Understanding the importance of education and cultural preservation, the UPSR proposes reforms to revitalize the education system and safeguard Ukrainian cultural heritage. They advocate for increased funding for education, expanded access to schools and universities, and the promotion of Ukrainian language and culture. The UPSR envisions a society where education serves as a catalyst for social mobility and cultural pride."

ukrsoc.164.t: "Kovalevskyi's Cooperatives Endeavour"
ukrsoc.164.d: "In Greater Ukraine, the cooperative began its struggle for the right to function as a type of economic formation. The relatively wide branching of Ukrainian cooperation required its consolidation into cooperative unions, which were soon created. In 1913, the first Ukrainian cooperative unions were forced to liquidate and were revived only after the February Revolution of 1917.\nProduction cooperation in Ukraine did not reach its potential development until 1917 due to the lack of legal grounds. The first agricultural Artel’ not only in Ukraine, but also in the entire Russian Empire, was founded in 1894. In the early days, the number of production cooperatives grew rapidly, and by 1902 there were already more than 125 production cooperatives in Great Ukraine\nA new impetus to the development of Ukrainian cooperation was given by the Ukrainian Central Rada, which already on March 20, 1917, issued the cooperative law, which created a legal basis for the activities and congresses of domestic cooperators.\n\nImmediately after the 1st Cooperative Congress, the Ukrainian Central Cooperative Committee (UCCC) began its activities as the main temporary organization of the entire domestic national cooperation. UCCC consisted of three main departments, namely: cultural and educational, auditing and insurance. In addition, five special commissions were created within its framework: statistical, financial, legal, educational and social. \n\nThe year 1917 gave a powerful impetus to the development of all branches of cooperation in Ukraine. During this year, for example, the number of consumer associations increased to 4,873, and the center of consumer cooperation was the organization created on May 6, 1917 called \"Dniprosoiuz\", which as of January 1918 had a financial turnover of 5 million roubles. It published the semi-monthly \"Cooperative Zoria\".\n\nA financial center of Ukrainian cooperation was created with branches in all major cities of the country - the Ukrainian People's Cooperative Bank (Ukrainbank).\n\nOne of the \"Whales\" of the Ukrainian cooperative movement became the First All-Ukrainian Agricultural and Economic Cooperative Union (abbreviated as \"Central\"), which was created in January 1918. The task of \"Central\" was wide agricultural activity, as well as the unification of agricultural cooperatives into a single structure and assistance in the formation of agricultural cooperatives.\n\nUnder the Hetman power, cooperation was moderately supported, but at the same time repressed everywhere, where it gave too much power to peasants. With the restoration of the Ukrainian People’s Republic, we will make everything for the Cooperative movement to come to fruition again!"

They argue that while some industries benefit from economies of scale, the majority of the economy can be effectively organized at the grassroots level. Their focus is on the development of villages and improving the welfare of peasants, aiming to create a more equitable and sustainable society.\n\"While we acknowledge the potential benefits of economies of scale in certain industries, we firmly believe that the majority of the economy can be most effectively organized through decentralized and localized efforts,\" - declares the Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries. With their emphasis on the well-being of the rural population, they propose a transformative agenda that aims to prioritize village development and improve the welfare of peasants.\n\nRecognizing the vital role that villages and peasants play in the fabric of Ukrainian society, the UPSR argues that fostering their growth and prosperity is essential for building a strong and inclusive nation. They advocate for redirecting resources and attention away from urban centers and towards rural areas, nurturing local economies, and providing support for agricultural initiatives.\nThe UPSR's vision encompasses various aspects of rural development, including infrastructure improvements, access to education and healthcare, and sustainable agricultural practices. By investing in the growth and modernization of villages, they seek to create vibrant and self-sustaining communities where the welfare of peasants is prioritized.\n\nCritics of the UPSR's proposal argue that de-emphasizing city development could hinder overall economic progress and neglect the potential gains from urbanization. However, the party firmly believes that a balanced approach, focusing on both rural and urban areas, is vital for achieving social harmony and reducing inequalities.\nThe proposals aim to address the historical neglect of rural areas and empower peasants, ensuring their active participation in the nation's development and decision-making processes."

The notoriety lingering behind the prime minister continues to generate a host of rumors and accusations, and for many, the very fact that Holubovych is once again prime minister is rather wild and inappropriate. \n\nThe fact is that it was under Holubovych's government that Skoropadskyi's armed coup took place in 1918, and it was Holubovych's government that allowed the occupation of the UNR by Austrian-German troops. The opposition to the Prime Minister demands the earliest possible consideration of this matter and the formulation of a resolution on the Party's attitude toward this incident, as well as, presumably, a vote of no confidence to the government and the Prime Minister."

For a long time, it contained too many slogans and required adaptation to the current political situation. The main debate is between the adoption of the Soviet platform - that is, the traditional doctrine of populism - and the adoption of a dualist platform - the recognition of both councils and parliament as important and entitled institutions. However, without the approval of the leader of the Central Committee, a radical decision to switch to a Soviet platform is impossible."

Practically the only functioning party of the Crimean Tatars, Milliy Firqa, was founded by the Narodniks and has a platform of rather socialist orientation. However, in addition to Milliy Fırqa, there is also a local regional branch of the UPSR led by Abram Derman in the region. Ethnically he does not belong to the Crimean Tatars, but he lived and worked in Simferopil since 1907. During the revolution, he was a member of the Rada of People's Representatives of the Taurian Province and was the secretary of the editorial board of the magazine \"Crimean Cooperator\".

ukrsoc.171.d: "As the sun rises over Kyiv, a new chapter unfolds in Ukrainian history. The Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, having recently achieved significant political influence, unveils an ambitious plan to establish a truly representative parliament. Their vision, inspired by the belief that democracy thrives only with the participation of all citizens, aims to bring together diverse voices from across the nation and empower them to shape the country's destiny.\nLeading this initiative is the UPSR's ingenious pragmatist, Mykyta Shapoval. His fervent passion for democracy and justice has earned him great respect among both party members and the wider populace. Shapoval is determined to bring the dream of a representative parliament to reality - a place where every Ukrainian, regardless of social standing or regional affiliation, feels heard and included.\nSupporters of the UPSR's plan have begun organizing meetings in various regions, engaging local citizens in lively debates and discussions. This inclusive approach has gained traction, with people from all walks of life attending these gatherings. Farmers, miners, factory workers, and intellectuals alike now exchange ideas and share their hopes for Ukraine in a truly democratic environment.\n\nThese grassroots initiatives are resonating with the general public, who take great pride in seeing their unique voices reflected in the emerging political landscape. Anticipation is mounting as the UPSR makes strides towards realizing its goal, and a sense of unity is palpable in cities and towns across Ukraine.\n\nAs the campaign for a representative parliament continues to gain momentum, many are inspired by the potential for a brighter and more inclusive future. This groundbreaking movement championed by the UPSR aims to make Ukrainian democracy a beacon of hope for others in the Eastern Europe and serves as a testament to the power of the people when united under a common cause. Only time will tell if the UPSR's vision can truly reshape the political landscape and bring forth the dawn of a new era in Ukraine's history."

Through a series of dialogues, round-table discussions, and political strategy sessions, the party navigates the intricacies of factionalism with shrewd diplomacy and genuine conviction. This newfound sense of unity has breathed a renewed vitality into the party, driving its members to work together with a newfound determination and optimism.\n\nWith the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries standing more united than ever, there is little doubt that the UPSR is poised to achieve great things under [ROOT.GetLeader]'s watch.

ukrsoc.173.t: "Introduction of the 'Labour Principle'"
ukrsoc.173.d: "The UPSR has recently unveiled the incorporation of the \"Labour Principle\" into its political doctrine. The new addition represents the UPSR's aim to further empower the working class and establish a more equitable society rooted in the promotion of hard work and the ideals of socialism.\n\nThe concept of the "Labour Principle" is grounded in the notion that all individuals engaged in productive labor should be granted equal rights and opportunities. UPSR envisions a society where the fruits of labor are fairly shared among its members, dismantling unjust power structures and eliminating the exploitation of the working masses.\n\nThe introduction of the "Labour Principle" has garnered significant attention from political organizations across Ukraine. Many have praised this move as a progressive step towards a more equitable social order, while others express skepticism about its practicality and potential impact on existing hierarchies.\n\nAs the UPSR marches forward with their bold agenda and seeks to popularize the "Labour Principle" among the general populace, observers remain divided on its ultimate ramifications.

The new composition of the government should be approved in the near future by the Rada, which is expected to show solidarity with the prime minister's decision. The coalition will allow for a more effective solution to the land issue, and will also allow the UPSR to expand its zone of influence over cities and the working class."
ukrsoc.178.a: "Ukraine turns more radical!"

ukrsoc.179.t: "First UPSR-Borotbyst Joint Congress"
ukrsoc.179.d: "As part of the unification of the formerly unified party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, the first joint and in many respects founding congress of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Borotbysts was held today. The congress was marked by the close attention of the press and marked the reunion of essentially two wings of one party and a joint meeting for the first time since 1918.\n\nA new party program was adopted at the congress, which included a number of Marxist theses, and a new party name was adopted to mark the unity."
ukrsoc.179.a: "Long live the united UPSR!"

ukrsoc.180.t: "Alienation of Urbanites from Social Democrats"
ukrsoc.180.d: "Along with the change in the course of the Borotbyst Party to support the current government, we gradually began to win back the urban electorate from the Social Democrats and Ukapists. The proletarian masses increasingly turned away from the UKP and the USDRP in favor of a truly popular party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. By concentrating our resources on "winning" the urban electorate, in the next elections we are likely to gain a profitable advantage not only in the countryside, but also in the city."
ukrsoc.180.a: "Our influence grows..."

ukrsoc.181.t: "Coalition With USDRP?"
ukrsoc.181.d: "Forging new bonds amidst a tumultuous political landscape, the Ukrainian Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries embarks on a high-stakes negotiation with the Ukrainian Social-Democrat Labour Party in hope of securing a powerful coalition. These talks, initiated by the UPSR's resourceful leader [ROOT.GetLeader], are a testament to the party's commitment to surmounting ideological differences for the sake of a stronger Ukraine.\n\nThroughout several meetings, closed-door consultations, and intense debates, this potential coalition presents two contrasting outcomes: the establishment of the coalition, or a failure to reach common ground. The success or collapse of these efforts will ultimately rest on the abilities of both parties to bridge their ideological divides and nurture a unified vision for the future of Ukraine.\n\nUnfortunately, the prospect of reconciliation between the UPSR and USDRP proved to be easier said than done, as long-standing disagreements over socialism's role in the nation and the extent of political reform have driven a wedge between these potential allies. Such differences have strained the negotiation process, leading both parties to accept the sobering reality that a formal cooperation, at least for now, remains beyond their reach."
ukrsoc.181.a: "Negotiations fail..."
ukrsoc.181.b: "The new Cabinet is formed."

ukrsoc.189.t: "Divisions Declare Neutrality"
ukrsoc.189.d: "Ukrainians killing Ukrainians — with the majority of soldiers and population really don’t understand why. Today, the newspapers reported on a small village, fully controlled by UPSR militia fighting low-scale battles against their fellow party-members from UPSR(b). The question arose: what for? Socialists, Ukrainians, even from the same party, are drawing bayonets against each other. After days of fighting, one side, we don’t know which side of the barricades, started to sing Marseillaise in Ukrainian — and the whole barricades followed, inviting each other to join them. After discussion, soldiers and peasants decided that Ukraine doesn’t deserve another bloody civil war. They created a joint Committee with officers, village heads and party leaders in the region to declare that from now on, they are done with fighting. Village will be neutral, governed by a united UPSR.\n\nSoon, the other villages and soldiers joined. Not seeing the sense and not understanding the reason for fighting, armies started to bond and take a neutral stance or completely desert. With the growing inter-ethnic violence, raids and anarchy spreading, some soldiers decided to return to their home and secure the order, while completely ignoring both mobilizations by UPR and Borotbysts."
ukrsoc.189.a: "Let them go. Only motivated soldiers can bring a truly people’s revolution."
ukrsoc.189.b: "We should stop it! If everyone will desert, no one will be left to fight! Establish party commissars in divisions to return order."

### Borotbysts events ###

ukrsoc.190.t: "Street Shootings"
ukrsoc.190.d: "Today the residents of a small town in a seemingly prosperous region of Ukraine were greatly alarmed by the shooting that began in the center of town! Squads of the Chervona Hvardiia of the Borotbysts invaded the city limits in order to seize power in yet another settlement and overthrow the local administration, by the way, elected by the population. The local Militia officers who were in the town were taken by surprise, and as a result of this daring attack, gunfire erupted within the town limits. A reinforced group of the People's Army had already rushed to the scene, but witnesses reported dead and wounded. The anger of the inhabitants is directed not only at the rebels, but also at the government, which is unable to protect them."
ukrsoc.191.t: "Mass Expropriations!"
ukrsoc.191.d: "The announced land reform led disgruntled Borotbyst rebels to call for mass expropriations of the country's land fund. Although in recent years the number of smallholders and Khutors in Ukraine has grown, ordinary peasants have not yet forgotten the large landowners' domination and bourgeois lawlessness. Borotbysts, with their support, promote the ideas of unfair distribution that our party has promoted and demand the liquidation of kulak and farms and expropriation in favor of \"Free People's Land Use\", whatever that means. In fact, the robbed farmers are trying to go to the local courts, but without proper government attention, even legal procedures cannot protect them."
ukrsoc.192.t: "Bourgeousie Flees the Country!"
ukrsoc.192.d: "The sabotage by the Borotbysts and their henchmen among the working class and the peasantry has led to trepidation and unrest not only among ordinary townspeople and workers, but also among less pleasant individuals - the remaining bourgeoisie, usually petty, who have not yet been reached by the Red Hand of the proletariat, are fleeing the country en masse. This, of course, would be to the advantage of our government, if it were not for the capital, the large sums of money and savings they are dragging behind them. Greedy to the penny, merchants and landowners take what they can get away with, enriching neighboring countries. The Borotbysts, at the same time, rejoice, celebrating the victory of the "true people's power\"."
ukrsoc.193.t: "Railway Bombing!"
ukrsoc.193.d: "Today, residents along the Kharkiv-Yuzivka railroad woke up in the middle of the night to a loud explosion and a cloud of smoke. Apparently, the Borotbysts rebels struck quickly in the dark and just as quickly fled into the Wild Steppe. The reason for their attack is obvious: the Kharkiv-Yuzivka railway line plays a key role in supplying the People's Army with equipment, and without them our troops will have difficulty with food and ammunition. Although we will send recovery brigades to get our trains up and running more quickly, the latest attack reflects the increasingly violent nature of the insurgency. We will make sure that when we find them, they pay for their crimes."
ukrsoc.194.t: "Industry Plant Sabotage!"
ukrsoc.194.d: "This morning the residents of Odesa awoke to a terrifying sight and sound: A bomb exploded at a factory, killing several people and injuring dozens more. The bomb severely damaged the plant as well as the local infrastructure. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by none other than the Borotbysts, who claimed that the attack was aimed at businesses in Transnistria belonging to a businessman loyal to the government. Although the reaction of local firefighters and police is admirable, many locals are extremely alarmed, and some even accuse the Ukrainian government of inaction. There is even a growing murmur that the actions of the government and the Land Commission in recent days have only provoked the Borotbysts into organizing more terrorist attacks. If we want to regain the trust of our people, we must redouble our efforts to show the people that we can protect them!"
ukrsoc.195.t: "Lynching of the [ROOT.GetRulingParty] Official!"
ukrsoc.195.d: "A terrifying act of terrorism took place today in a regional center that has already been covered by all the local newspapers. Today a rally of disgruntled citizens was taking place in one of the city districts, among them many workers, and of course the rally was not ignored by borotbist provocateurs, who turned it into a mass protest. A local regional deputy from the ruling party arrived at the rally to discuss pressing issues with local residents and find compromises, but the mob, enraged by the Borotbysts provocateurs, attacked the defenseless official and lynched him. About 20 people, some of whom were armed with revolvers, actually took the official hostage, then brutally beat him and handed him over to the vicious mob, which could no longer distinguish between justice and lynching. People's Army units rushed to the scene of the nightmarish incident and forcibly dispersed the protests, however, the situation takes on a distinctly chaotic character and the peaceful citizens demand that the city garrison be reinforced."
ukrsoc.196.t: "Supply Shortfall"
ukrsoc.196.d: "An important food delivery from the agrarian region to Kyiv was disrupted today, leaving stores and townspeople without fresh produce. Although the incident went virtually unnoticed by ordinary citizens, who nevertheless received the full price, it came to the attention of the government and the armed forces when it was discovered that the trucks carrying the goods had been seized by Borotbi rebels: the drivers were killed and the food was diverted to the local Red Guards, an illegal terrorist group. The disruption of food supplies has become more frequent recently, following another controversial decision of the Land Commission, which obviously contributes to the strengthening of the Borotbyst opposition."
ukrsoc.190.a: "Something must be done to stop them!"


ukrsoc.200.t: "Shumskyi Calls For All-Ukrainian Strike!"
ukrsoc.200.d: "The leader of the Borotbysts, Oleksandr Shumskyi, today in his appeal to the Ukrainian people called for an all-Ukrainian strike - in factories, railroads, etc. The URPSR(b), dissatisfied with the implementation of land reform, has been developing revolutionary sentiments and hatred of the government among our citizens, especially among peasants and workers, for quite some time. They demand an immediate solution to the land question, but have now moved on to more radical measures and are calling for a socialist revolution and what they call "liberation of the working masses from exploitation. This would not be so alarming if it were not for the actual growth of revolutionary sentiment in society. It seems that many will follow this proclamation and paralyze our economy."
ukrsoc.200.a: "Who he is to dictate us?!"

ukrsoc.201.t: "Strikes in Major Cities"
ukrsoc.201.d: "Today major Ukrainian cities, including Kyiv, Kharkiv, Katerynoslav, and Odesa saw major strikes by workers. Demanding fair working conditions as well as a solution to the problems of food and grain in the countryside, workers paralyzed the work of Ukraine's largest factories. Police and army forces are insufficient to contain the protests and it seems that Ukraine is sinking more and more into revolutionary chaos."
ukrsoc.201.a: "Catastrophe!"

ukrsoc.202.t: "Peasants Protest En-Masse!"
ukrsoc.202.d: "Excited by the appeals of the Borotbysts, the peasants began to protest en masse against the bread monopoly and the imperfect land reform. Long in need of an improvement in their situation and a solution to the land question, the peasants grew tired of waiting. It seems that the situation in the village is finally out of the control of the central government. "
ukrsoc.202.a: "We are losing the ground!"

ukrsoc.203.t: "Protesters Seize Kharkiv"
ukrsoc.203.d: "The worst situation is in Kharkiv. Revolutionary workers began arming themselves and organizing themselves into militia units. In addition, we received a number of news reports that it was in Kharkiv that the Borotbyst leadership had arrived under cover to lead the revolution. According to the latest reports, the revolutionary masses have seized the telegraph, post office, and administrative buildings, and there are endless masses of workers with red flags in the central squares, demanding justice and equality."
ukrsoc.203.a: "We must do something immediately!"

ukrsoc.204.t: "Nationalists Clash With Borotbysts"
ukrsoc.204.d: "The latest news from Kharkiv is shocking in its cruelty. Local newspapers report that reactionary nationalists and Sich Striltsi arrived in Kharkiv to suppress the protests, resulting in gunshots being heard and a stampede in the central square. People's militia units have engaged in a firefight with the nationalists and so far the UVO is outnumbered and has no tactical or strategic initiative. The outcome of this confrontation is not yet predetermined, but radicalization and violence can only lead to a worsening of the overall situation."
ukrsoc.204.a: "Borotbyst People's Militia defeats the UVO cells"

ukrsoc.205.t: "Borotbysts Proclaim Socialist Republic!"
ukrsoc.205.d: "We have almost completely lost control of southeastern Ukraine. The industrially rich regions, as well as the black-earth provinces, for the most part rebelled and recognized the new power of the Borotbysts. Taking advantage of this advantage and legitimacy, today the Central Committee of the UPSR(b) has issued an appeal to all the workers of Ukraine. The revolutionaries announced the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic, and undertook a march to Kyiv.\n\nFortunately, the revolutionaries' attack was repulsed and they were driven back to the Southeast. However, the loss of the entire southeastern region could not help but worry the government, which announced a general mobilization against the revolutionaries and troublemakers. "
ukrsoc.205.a: "Borotbyst attack on Kyiv repulsed."
ukrsoc.205.b: "Borotbyst attacks succeeds."

ukrsoc.206.t: "Ukrainian Civil War"
ukrsoc.206.d: "All masks are dropped. The Borotbysts were able to rally the most revolutionary masses around them and called for the violent overthrow of power throughout the country. The southeast is under their complete control, and we can answer them with nothing but violence for violence. It is time to arm ourselves in order to defend our power and prevent some rogues and revolutionaries from wreaking havoc in our country!"
ukrsoc.206.a: "All Power to Soviets! (Play as Borotbysts)"
ukrsoc.206.b: "We should defeat these traitors!"

ukrsoc.207.t: "Formation of the Chervona Armiia"
ukrsoc.207.d: "A special decree of the Central Committee of the Borotbyst Party announced the creation of the Ukrainian Red Army. Armed units of self-defense and people's militia were to unite under a single command and to resist counter-revolutionary forces in an organized manner. In addition, a number of generals known as \"Red Otamans\" - leaders of the insurgent movement - expressed their commitment to socialist power. Although they do not directly obey orders from the center, we are acting in concert."
ukrsoc.207.a: "Glory to our socialist army!"

ukrsoc.208.t: "Left UPSR Joins Us"
ukrsoc.208.d: "The left branch of the UPSR, led by Levko Kovaliv, our comrade-in-arms and supporter of party unification, announced its withdrawal from the UPSR and recognized the UPSR as a bourgeois party. We are happy to welcome our former partisans into the ranks of a truly revolutionary party, and we are also open to cooperation with other revolutionary forces."
ukrsoc.208.a: "The fate of the UPSR is now sealed"

ukrsoc.209.t: "Victory Over Counter-Revolutionaries!"
ukrsoc.209.d: "With the capture of all the key cities where socialist authority had not yet been officially established and with the disarming of all bourgeois forces, power throughout Ukraine passed into the hands of the revolutionary people. Ukraine is finally free from the yoke of capital, and now we have much to do to strengthen revolutionary power."
ukrsoc.209.a: "Khai Zhyve Radianska Ukraina!"

ukrsoc.210.t: "The Borotbysts Defeated!"
ukrsoc.210.d: "The last pockets of revolutionary rebellion were suppressed, and the leadership of the Borotbysts was either expelled or arrested. Stability is gradually returning to our country."
ukrsoc.210.a: "Great!"

ukrsoc.211.t: "Unmasking the Dyrektoria"
ukrsoc.211.d: "Today, in the main party newspaper \"Borotba\", published in large circulation throughout the territory under our control, the counter-revolutionary and bourgeois-democratic power of the so-called Dyrektoria was officially denounced. Under the guise of socialist slogans, the Dyrektoria power pursued policies in the interests of the capitalists, not those of the working people. Such behavior must not go unpunished and at best a revolutionary trial awaits all the leaders of the Dyrektoria."
ukrsoc.211.a: "Rise against counter-revolutionary forces!"

ukrsoc.212.t: "Ukapists Join Us"
ukrsoc.212.d: "The Ukrainian Communist Party, a left-wing radical breakaway from the USDRP, also announced a switch to socialist power. Given the ideological similarities and proximity, our cooperation with the Ukapists will help in our revolutionary struggle and attract more workers to our side."
ukrsoc.212.a: "True people's front is forming!"

ukrsoc.215.t: "New Party Leadership"
ukrsoc.215.d: "The last organized resistance of counter-revolutionary and reactionary forces was destroyed. In this connection, a congress of the Central Committee of the UPSR(b) was convened in Kyiv to establish a provisional workers' and peasants' government of Ukraine until the convening of the Main Rada of Revolutionary Emissaries. One of the main issues to be decided by the congress was the election of the head of the new Soviet government.\nOf the candidates for this role is the current leader of the party, Oleksandr Shumskyi, an ardent revolutionary and true defender of the revolution. Besides him, Vasyl Ellan-Blakytnyi, a poet and revolutionary, an adherent of the Soviet system, is also a contender for the post. Of the less popular candidates, Panas Liubchenko, one of the youngest candidates, a supporter of anti-etatism and the development of collective farming, is also considered. In addition to him, the congress also nominated Levko Kovaliv, an SR close to the Borotbysts, who joined the revolutionary forces along with other leftist SRs from the central stream of the UPSR."
ukrsoc.215.a: "Shumskyi for the Premier!"
ukrsoc.215.b: "The Congress votes for Vasyl Blakytnyi."
ukrsoc.215.c: "Panas Liubchenko is chosen to lead."
ukrsoc.215.e: "A more moderate Kovaliv is elected instead."

ukrsoc.217.t: "Skrypnyk On Trial"
ukrsoc.217.d: "Today a revolutionary tribunal was held in Kyiv over the leaders of the Ukrainian Communist Party, and more specifically over Comrade Skrypnyk and his accomplices, the supporters of Bolshevism and the Great Russian imperialists. \n\nThe Revolutionary Court found that Mykola Skrypnyk, while in office as head of state, had voluntarily entered into treaties with Bolshevik Russia that led to the loss of Ukraine's independence in matters of state policy. In addition, they pointed to the absolute incompetence of the previous government in land reform. In addition to Skrypnyk, Mykola Khvyliovyi and Yuri Lapchynskyi, who were considered by the court to be \"Skrypnyk's accomplices\", were also indicted.\n\nAs a result, the Court pronounced the sentence: to sentence Skrypnyk, Khvyliovyi, Lapchynskyi, and 12 others to death by shooting as enemies of the Ukrainian people."
ukrsoc.217.a: "Bolshevism should be finally condemned!"

ukrsoc.220.t: "Main Rada of Revolutionary Emissaries"
ukrsoc.220.d: "To govern revolutionary Ukraine requires the creation of a revolutionary body of executive power, a burden that was temporarily assumed by the Central Committee of the Borotbyst Party. Today the first socialist government of independent Ukraine was officially formed - the Main Rada (Council) of Revolutionary Emissaries. The new government should govern the working masses more effectively and will perform all the duties of the government of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic until the main goal of the World Socialist Federation and Communism is achieved."
ukrsoc.220.a: "A reliable institution of Rada power!"

ukrsoc.221.t: "Decree On Forms of Collective Farming"
ukrsoc.221.d: "Today the Rada of the Revolutionary Emissaries issued an official resolution explaining permissible agricultural devices. Despite the apparent prohibition of private enterprise and private ownership, the Rada, in cooperation with the Emissary of Agriculture, has prepared a number of possible entities with the main emphasis on the collectivity of these formations. First of all, peasants are recommended to form cooperatives, for which special privileges are introduced. In addition to cooperatives, a program will also be developed to introduce state-owned estates on which collective farming will be carried out."
ukrsoc.221.a: "Collectivism is spreading in Ukraine"

ukrsoc.222.t: "Reforming the Insurgent Divisions"
ukrsoc.222.d: "During the revolution, a number of generals who led rebel divisions in Ukraine came over to our side, but although they shared our ideas and we fought with them for the same goal, their autonomy could not be called satisfactory. First, and most importantly, their divisions and battalions do not conform to the model of the Chervona Armia, to which they should conform. Our armed forces must be united in defending the frontiers of our country, and for this, order and discipline must reign in the army."
ukrsoc.222.a: "They should be organized on the model of the Red Army!"

ukrsoc.223.t: "The Red Otamans"
ukrsoc.223.d: "In spite of our quite fair demands to streamline the divisions according to the Chervona Armia model, not all the generals followed this demand. Unofficially, these soldiers are known as \"Red Otamans\" - that is, the leaders of the rebel divisions fighting for socialist ideals. In reality, however, many of them have their own programs, extending not only to the organization of the rebel divisions under their control, but also to the territory in which they are stationed and operate. This state of affairs cannot continue for long, but the Rada of the Revolutionary Emissaries has no unanimity in dealing with this situation. Some demand immediate subjugation of the Red Otamans, others insist on the advisory nature of the demands, so as not to provoke the already disgruntled generals too much. Others propose to grant them autonomy in some matters in return for loyalty to the government. A number of high-ranking generals of the Red Army suggest that they should be forced into submission and repressed in case of disobedience."
ukrsoc.223.a: "Enforce their loyalty!"
ukrsoc.223.b: "Demand their 'armies' to be directly subordinated to us!"
ukrsoc.223.c: "Remind them of their duty towards the Red Army."
ukrsoc.223.e: "Give them some autonomy in return for their loyalty."

ukrsoc.224.t: "[THIS.GetName] Resistance!"
ukrsoc.224.d: "Despite our efforts, we have only provoked [THIS.GetName] to openly resist us! Now we have to deal with the insurgency, before the conflict escalates."
ukrsoc.224.a: "Let him enjoy some autonomy."
ukrsoc.224.b: "Agree to some demands, but keep an eye on him."
ukrsoc.224.c: "Violently suppress the resistance!"

ukrsoc.226.t: "Allies Among the Poale Zion"
ukrsoc.226.d: "The Jewish Communist Party, Poale Zion, has been our vital ally during the Ukrainian Revolution. Our close relations should be now restored to a proper level. However, the Revolutionary Emissaries split on the core of these relations. One suggest that Poale Zion should officially join our government as a coalition party. The others assume this option to be too radical and just suggest to form coalitions with Poale Zion on the local levels, in local Radas and Trade Unions. The others, who are in minority, believe that we should not cooperate on official level and just ensure Jewish national-cultural autonomy is enough for cooperation between our parties."
ukrsoc.226.a: "They should play a role in the government."
ukrsoc.226.b: "Cooperate with them on local level."
ukrsoc.226.c: "They should have enough national-cultural autonomy."

ukrsoc.227.t: "Formation of the Red Cossackry"
ukrsoc.227.d: "A new strategic decision has been made by our government to establish a force known as the Red Cossackry. Committed to advancing the socialist cause and protecting Ukraine's hard-won revolutionary gains, this grassroots military force combines the progressive ambitions of the Borotbysts with the legendary valor and traditions of the Cossacks.\n\nCossacks have played a central role in Ukrainian heritage, embodying the spirit of freedom, independence, and self-governance throughout the centuries. Their unique martial prowess, equestrian skills, and resilience have become inextricably linked to the Ukrainian identity. It is with this proud history that the Borotbysts seek to establish the Red Cossackry, capturing the essence of Ukraine's storied past while forging a bridge to a hopeful, socialist future.\n\nThe Red Cossackry, adopting their moniker and red attire to signify their allegiance to socialism, has embarked on a mission to protect the revolution and its many supporters from the forces that seek to undermine progress. By connecting the age-old heritage of the Cossacks to the ideals of the Borotbyst-led change, the revolutionary government ensures that the struggle for social justice remains deeply rooted in Ukrainian history and national pride.\n\nAs the Borotbyst government continues to support the growth of the Red Cossackry, the spirit of hope for a better future can be felt across the nation. With the unyielding determination of the Red Cossacks, a new dawn for Ukraine is on the horizon, blending tradition and progress in the pursuit of a more equitable and just society under the Borotbyst revolutionary government."
ukrsoc.227.a: "An much needed advancement."

ukrsoc.228.t: "The Path to Unity: Borotbysts and Ukapists"
ukrsoc.228.d: "In the ever-evolving political landscape of Ukraine, the Borotbyst revolutionary government is faced with a critical decision on their relationship with the Ukapists, the Ukrainian Communist Party. Both parties hold similar socialist aspirations and could potentially formulate a stronger front if they join forces. As the power dynamics shift, the question of collaboration becomes increasingly crucial.\nSeveral options are laid out before the Borotbyst leadership, each presenting its own unique set of benefits and challenges:\n- Unification into a single party could amplify the strength of the socialist movement in Ukraine by streamlining their vision and actions. But it could also lead to friction and internal conflict, as both parties have to contend with clashing ideas and assumptions of control.\n- Forming a ruling coalition may be a more palatable alternative, allowing both parties to retain their distinct identities while joining hands for a common cause. Yet, such an arrangement might inadvertently stoke existing divisions, hampering their ability to govern effectively.\n- Cooperation on specific issues presents a lower-stakes opportunity for collaboration. By focusing on their shared goals, both parties can work together productively, while maintaining the freedom to pursue divergent objectives elsewhere. This careful balance might be jeopardized if either side perceives the other as encroaching on their territory.\n- Allowing the Ukapist party to exist but preserving the majority of local council seats for the Borotbysts may satisfy their desire to expand the socialist movement without losing control. This option carries the risk of seeming too domineering; the Ukapists may feel undermined and grow resentful, resulting in further discord down the line.\n- Banning the Ukapist party would undeniably assert the Borotbysts' dominance, but at the cost of alienating their potential allies. This aggressive move could destabilize the political landscape and spark internal struggles, ultimately weakening the socialist cause within Ukraine.\n\nThe Borotbyst government must consider the implications of each option, as the future of socialism in Ukraine hangs in the balance. The path chosen will shape not only their relationship with the Ukapists but also their standing in the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people."
ukrsoc.228.a: "We should unite into one party"
ukrsoc.228.b: "Invite them into ruling coalition."
ukrsoc.228.c: "We can cooperate on some issues, but not much."
ukrsoc.228.e: "Allow their party to exist, but control our majority."
ukrsoc.228.f: "Ban their party!"

ukrsoc.229.t: "The World Socialist Federation"
ukrsoc.229.d: "As the political landscape of Ukraine continues to evolve under the guidance of the Borotbyst revolutionary government, an inspiring vision emerges with global implications. This vision, championed by the Borotbysts, aims to transform the entire world into a united World Socialist Federation. This ambitious dream is outlined in their political program, emphasizing broader goals beyond Ukraine's borders and inspiring their followers to rally behind the cause.\n\nThe Borotbysts believe that through cooperation and unification with like-minded socialist forces worldwide, they will be able to bring about a global revolution that will transcend national boundaries. They argue that the establishment of a World Socialist Federation would not only help eradicate poverty, inequality, and exploitation but also lead to the ultimate realization of a classless society where the working people hold the power.\n\nAs this idea gains steam among the Borotbyst supporters, it stirs both excitement and apprehension. The potential benefits of such a Federation are enticing – the combined force of socialist nations would be a formidable power on the global stage, with the ability to effectively challenge the capitalist order. This new world order would promote the ideals of socialism, paving the way for the emancipation of the working class across the globe.\n\nHowever, the path to achieving this vision is fraught with challenges and uncertainties. The pursuit of a transnational socialist movement may trigger backlash from the ruling elites, leading to political instability, conflict, and war. Furthermore, aligning with other socialist nations may require ideological compromises, which could dilute the Borotbysts' unique identity and polarize their supporters.\n\nAlthough the prospects of a World Socialist Federation hold great promise for the Borotbysts and their followers, the journey to make this dream a reality will undoubtedly be a treacherous one. The choices they make along the way will not only shape the destiny of socialism in Ukraine but also determine their role in the global struggle between capitalism and socialism."
ukrsoc.229.a: "This is a much interesting perspective!"

ukrsoc.230.t: "Thousand Communes"
ukrsoc.230.d: "Inspired by the ideals of communal living and participatory democracy, the UPSR(b) of Ukraine spearheads the "Thousand Communes" movement. This movement aims to establish communal municipalities across the country, where people collectively govern their local affairs, promote social equality, and build sustainable communities.\n\nWith the development of Communal Odesa, other cities, supported by UPSR(b) and local soviets push proposals for more and more extreme self-governance. The new vision, however unbalanced it is, a vision of thousand Communes aligned in one Ukrainian confederation. For now, Borotbyst government secures the effort to have vital industries outside of Communal outreach, governed directly by syndicates and (or) soviets centrally to ensure effective economic development. The other spheres are undergoing active decentralization, unprecedented in Ukraine."
ukrsoc.230.a: "Communal Ukraine!"

ukrsoc.231.t: "Devolution"
ukrsoc.231.d: "As the Borotbyst government remains steadfast in its commitment to socialism, a significant shift in its approach to governance has begun to take root. Inspired by libertarian socialist principles and aiming to further empower the people, the Borotbyst leadership has embarked on a substantial devolution of power, handing over the reins of administration to local peasant and worker councils. This bold move marks a significant departure from the centralized control maintained by many other socialist governments.\n\nThis 'Great Devolution' has far-reaching implications, as it not only drastically alters the political landscape of the nation but also fosters a deeper sense of ownership and participation among the working class. With unprecedented access to decision-making powers, these local councils are now responsible for overseeing a wide array of social, economic, and administrative affairs, leaving the central government with a primarily advisory and coordinative role.\n\nThe central government's main focus lies in maintaining the overall direction of the Ukrainian economy and foreign policy, allowing for a certain level of national cohesion despite the decentralized nature of governance. This approach is believed to strike a balance between preserving the unified front required for international relations, while encouraging popular self-governance at the grassroots level.\n\nAs the process of devolution unfolds, both excitement and skepticism abound. The prospect of participating directly in policy-making has invigorated the citizenry, but concerns have been raised regarding the ability of local councils to effectively manage the myriad responsibilities laid before them. Some worry that factionalism and infighting may emerge, undermining the country's stability and socialist ideals.\n\nNonetheless, the Borotbyst government remains committed to its vision of grassroots governance, believing that only through the genuine empowerment of the working people can the true potential of socialism be realized. The success or failure of this 'Great Devolution' will ultimately stand as a testament to the viability of a truly decentralized socialist republic."

ukrsoc.232.d: "In a bold, unexpected move, the Ukrainian Borotbysts have extended a careful hand of cooperation to the remnants of the once-formidable Makhnivschyna and the ideologically scattered RPAU. While the Borotbysts are popular proponents of socialism, the Makhnivschyna follows in the footsteps of the great anarchist Nestor Makhno, and RPAU (Revolutionary Peasants Army of Ukraine) represents a diverse array of anarchist beliefs.\n\nAs these political rebels have found refuge in the South-Eastern countryside, where their influence still yields power amongst rural citizens, the Borotbysts stand to gain from a mutually beneficial alliance. However, uniting such distinct groups is a task fraught with complications, as reaching a common understanding may challenge the very foundations that each group is built upon."

ukrsoc.250.t: "Borotbyst Uprising!"
ukrsoc.250.d: "It was not only Otaman Petliura who decided to take advantage of the indecision of the Dyrektoria, but also the damned socialists Borotbysts. Publicly opposing the Dyrektoria all these years and months, they decided to stab the Republican government in the back and tried to organize an uprising in the South and Southeast. So far they have managed to contain them, but peasants and workers, drugged by the propaganda of the Borotbyst ideas, are rebelling all over the country.\n\nOtaman and the new government must take all urgent measures to suppress the uprising, or the future of Ukraine will be in jeopardy."
ukrsoc.250.a: "We should crush these traitors!"

ukrsoc.251.t: "Borotbysts Proclaim Socialist Republic!"
ukrsoc.251.d: "We have almost completely lost control of southeastern Ukraine. The industrially rich regions, as well as the black-earth provinces, for the most part rebelled and recognized the new power of the Borotbysts. Taking advantage of this advantage and legitimacy, today the Central Committee of the UPSR(b) has issued an appeal to all the workers of Ukraine. The revolutionaries announced the establishment of the Ukrainian Socialist Republic, and undertook a march to Kyiv.\n\nFortunately, the revolutionaries' attack was repulsed and they were driven back to the Southeast. However, the loss of the entire southeastern region could not help but worry the government, which announced a general mobilization against the revolutionaries and troublemakers. "

ukrsoc.252.t: "Ukraine In Danger"
ukrsoc.252.d: "After the widespread rebellion of the Borotbysts in the south, Otaman faced several serious questions, one of the key ones being the search for allies. \n\nThe main option was to strike at the opposition from both the left and the right and try to form a new directorate under Otaman's control. A number of politicians from the leading parties: the UPSR, USDRP, ULD(S-F), UPSS and others have already expressed their agreement to form a united anti-Borotbyst front. \n\nAnother option is to propose an alliance to Andriy Melnyk, the leader of the Galician Sich Striltsi and an ally of the Dyrektoria. In this way, we would gain the support of Ukrainian nationalists and elite armed forces, which would easily help us in the fight against the Borotbysts.\n\nThe last option is to make concessions to the Borotbysts. An option that seems impossible and would call into question the authority of Petliura. However, this is the only option that will help to solve all the issues peacefully."

ukrsoc.253.t: "Melnyk Proposes Governmental Reform"
ukrsoc.253.d: "Today, in a surprise move, one of Ukraine's esteemed Diarchs, Commander Andriy Melnyk, delivered a passionate speech before the Rada, proposing a comprehensive governmental reform. His ideas have the potential to drastically change the social and political landscape in our country, and as such, have garnered a highly polarized response from the audience.\n\nDuring his 20-minute address, Andriy Melnyk outlined an ambitious plan to reshape the government and provide new solutions to some of Ukraine's most pressing issues. However, not everyone was convinced by his rhetoric. A strong contingent of deputies, particularly those from the USDRP, along with several loyal supporters of our other Diarch, Symon Petliura, deemed the proposal to be undemocratic and even dangerous.\n\nCritics of Melnyk's reform warn that embracing these changes could potentially invite an increase in corruption and nepotism within our government, leading to a wide array of long-term negative consequences for our beloved nation."

ukrsoc.254.d: "With the recent initiative from Symon Petliura, to introduce social-democratic commissars into the army ranks, tensions continue to rise among certain circles within our military forces. This controversial move has particularly upset a prominent nationalist faction headed by Andriy Melnyk and centered around the elite Sich Striltsi.\n\nToday, tensions reached a boiling point when one of the high-ranking officers of the Sich Striltsi made a scandalous public outburst, vehemently denouncing the newly appointed social-democratic commissars.\n\nThis unexpected public display of dissent has immediately sent shockwaves throughout the military hierarchy and threatens to sow further divisions within our already fragile nation. Some argue that the introduction of social-democratic commissars in the army is a betrayal of Ukraine's nationalist ideals, while others contend that attempting to quell this scandal by any means necessary could lead to even more internal strife and unrest.\n\nUkraine's delicate balance between factions may be at risk, and every decision we make from this point forward could have far-reaching consequences. This scandal sets forth difficult choices between preserving unity in our army or prioritizing the values some soldiers hold dear. The road ahead is uncertain, and the future of our nation hangs precariously in the balance."
ukrsoc.254.a: "Back down."
ukrsoc.254.b: "Go on with our reform."
ukrsoc.254.c: "Push new, more radical program of social-democratization and cadre rotation."

ukrsoc.255.t: "SB Demands More Financing"
ukrsoc.255.d: "The Sluzhba Bezpeky (SB), the primary intelligence and security agency of the [UKR.GetName], has recently approached the government with a request for increased funding. Their argument is that the current budget is insufficient to combat the growing threats, both internal and external, as well as to effectively maintain national security and stability.\n\nRumors have surfaced about the agency's plans to significantly expand its scope of operations to better keep tabs on dissenting factions and hostile foreign entities. The SB's request has garnered mixed reactions from the Petliura-Melnyk administration as they grapple with balancing the need for security while also maintaining the delicate balance of power between various factions, especially given the current unrest within the military.\n\nIn the face of rising tensions and potential conflicts, the debate over increased funding for the SB is becoming a critical issue for the government. Allocating more resources to the agency may strengthen short-term stability, but could also lead to increased surveillance, reduced personal freedoms, and a chilling effect on political dissent. On the other hand, rejecting SB's demands may only exacerbate the underlying problems and weaken the government's ability to provide security in the long term."

ukrsoc.256.t: "Petliura Loyalists Angered By Military Privileges"
ukrsoc.256.d: "In light of the growing tensions within the military, another rift has emerged among the ranks. Loyalists to Symon Petliura, have voiced their anger and concern over the military privileges granted to Commander Andriy Melnyk's faction. The loyalist faction perceives this preferential treatment of the Sich Striltsi as a violation of the principles of democracy and meritocracy that Petliura stands for.\n\nThe Petliura loyalists argue that by condoning such corrupt practices, we are undermining the very foundations upon which our nation was built. These tensions have begun to reach a tipping point, and it grows increasingly likely that the situation may escalate beyond mere verbal arguments.\n\nThe internal strife within our military now extends across multiple factions, threatening to dismantle any semblance of unity. We must tread carefully through these turbulent times, as the future of our nation could be irrevocably affected by our response to these events. As we navigate this delicate situation, we must find a way to quell the rising discontent without compromising our core principles or further alienating any of our factions. The stakes have never been higher, and every choice we make could bring us one step closer to either our salvation or our destruction."
ukrsoc.256.a: "A necessary concession to ensure peace..."

ukrsoc.257.t: "Independent Trade-Unions Oppose Corporatisation"
ukrsoc.257.d: "One of our various still independent trade-unions have publicly opposed the policies of corporatisation, encouraged by the new Dualist government of Ukraine. While Melnyk's faction is promoting the idea of uniting small organisation into large corporations with the government's increased control over them, the USDRP still believes in power of the independent small-scaled organisations, especially the ones, controlled by workers and their representatives. While the scandal has arose about one of the organisations, the government has now slowed down corporatisation a bit, giving more room for freedom of trade unions."
ukrsoc.257.a: "An obstacle or only sane organisation?"

ukrsoc.258.t: "Civilian Administration Removes Corrupt Officer"
ukrsoc.258.d: "As tensions continue to rise within the military and various factions, the civilian administration of the USDRP has taken a stand against corruption. News has spread that the local USDRP-led government has removed a corrupt officer who was assigned by Melnyk's administration, forcing him into retirement. While this may seem like a small victory, it has sparked rumors of a much larger, wide-scale anti-corruption campaign initiated by the USDRP administration.\n\nIt appears that the civilian government is taking a stand against the excesses of military privilege. However, it remains to be seen how Melnyk's faction and the military as a whole will react to this challenge to their authority.\n\nAs we navigate this complex political landscape, the balance of power between civilian and military forces is becoming increasingly crucial to the stability of our nation. It is clear that we must take a strong stance on corruption in our ranks, but we must also be cautious as too bold of a move could incite further unrest. The delicate game of power and influence continues, with the future of our nation hanging in the balance."

ukrsoc.259.d: "Today it became known about the decree of the Supreme Otaman on the establishment of territorial defense troops and the deployment of appropriate points on the territory of Ukraine. The new agency and kind of troops are needed to protect and organize the guerrilla movement in connection with possible threats to the occupation of our country's territory.\n\nThe territorial defense will be a volunteer force and anyone can join, but only under conditions of defensive warfare"
ukrsoc.259.a: "An interesting development"

ukrsoc.260.t: "Petliurivtsi Disarm Borotbyst Division"
ukrsoc.260.d: "The official stance of the government, despite some sort of 'Duumvirate', as it is called informally, is that the territory currently controlled by the Borotbyst government is illegaly occupied. Moreover, all armed groups of the Borotbysts are just regular bandits, who do not have any right to own weapons or use them. While all sides understand this stance, sometimes the Petliurivtsi manage to either negotiate or force the Borotbyst divisions to give up and be disarmed. Hopefully, all their divisions will be disarmed as soon as possible, before our conflict can reach a hot stage."
ukrsoc.260.a: "They don't have any license, they are regular bandits!"

ukrsoc.261.t: "Petliurivtsi Restore Control Over the Plant"
ukrsoc.261.d: "With Borotbysts controlling much of the Ukrainian most industrially developed region of Donbas, their loyal trade-unions and worker committees have effectively seized control over the plants and factories in the region. However, their domination will eventually end, as loyalists of Central Government and supporters of Petliura's policies, who are rather suspicious of Borotbysts have seized control over one of the plants last weekend. Those people, also coming from the working class, understand all the damage that can be produced by the Borotbysts and therefore, claimed their allegiance to the legitimate government of Otaman Petliura."
ukrsoc.261.a: "Another factory comes back to us!"

ukrsoc.262.t: "Borotbysts Demand Socialization"
ukrsoc.262.d: "The Borotbyst leadership has once again officially appealed to us with the demands to implement full socialization, mainly of land and factories, which in their opinion is the real drawback of our government. By forcefully seizing the lands and factories from the peasants and workers only to transfer them to the 'people's ownership', we will anger not only the Kulaks, but regular proletariat and peasantry as well, so that is a step that Otaman and his government will never take."
ukrsoc.262.a: "We hear their demands. Let them hear our 'No!'"

ukrsoc.263.t: "Formation of Soviet Divisions"
ukrsoc.263.d: "With some of our regions under the control of Borotbysts, they have announced mobilisation, at least mostly voluntary by now, but it still is considered a major threat by the central government. The Soviet divisions, formed by Borotbysts are now appearing in many regions, and we must be sure that they will attack us when the time comes. With this in mind, Otaman has announced additional measures to counter Borotbysts, especially considering our military equipment and training."
ukrsoc.263.a: "This is becoming a dangerous trend."

ukrsoc.264.t: "Agitation at Petliura's Soldiers"
ukrsoc.264.d: "Not only Borotbysts form separate army at the other side of the so-called 'frontline', but also agitate at our soldiers in order to change their allegiance. These fools and traitors listen to the lies of Shumskyi and Blakytnyi and desert to join the rebels. This is now becoming a dangerous threat with more and more soldiers joining the enemy, sometimes even whole divisions have to be disbanded because of their treacherous behavior."
ukrsoc.264.a: "There will be always traitors."

ukrsoc.265.t: "Meeting In Myrhorod"
ukrsoc.265.d: "At the initiative of infantry general Ivan Zubkovskyi in 1917 a health resort was opened near Myrhorod's eastern city borders, near the beautiful mixed forests of pines and birches. The water of Myrhorod springs belongs to the low-mineral sodium chloride waters and is close in composition to the mineral waters of the leading European spas such as Baden-Baden or Aachen. \n\nHowever, a couple of years ago the quite popular place now looks rather neglected. A couple of kilometers to the south was already the field headquarters of the Borotbyst Chervona Armia, and in the nearby town itself, Red Flags were flying and looting and rioting were rampant. \n\nBeautiful Poltava region, Otaman's native land! This was the place chosen by the initiators of the meeting of the two commanders-in-chief. A meeting that was to determine the fate of Ukraine. Petliura was the first to appear. However, soon a motorcade pulled up to the health resort, out of which a Borotbyst delegation led by the self-proclaimed leader of the South - Oleksandr Shumskyi emerged."
ukrsoc.265.a: "Let us seat and talk."

ukrsoc.266.t: "Tiutiunnyk's Mission"
ukrsoc.266.d: "Yuri Tiutiunnyk, one of the greatest supporters of Dyrektoria, has quite left-leaning views, which is not a secret to most governmental officials and public political figures. He is known as an unconditional Ukrainian patriot, but he is sympathetic to both sides and that is why he was chosen as the main \"ambassador\" and mediator, usually unofficial in view of the mutual non-recognition of the sides to each other, between the Otaman Petliura headquarters and the Borotbysts. \n\nWith a mission to establish contact and offer a high-level meeting to discuss terms, Tyutyunnik traveled to the heart of \"Borotbyst Ukraine\" in order to arrange with Shumskyi for a meeting with Petliura. \n\nIf Tiutiunnyk's mission succeeds, we will be able to establish close contact with Shumskyi and possibly negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict, but a peaceful solution is unlikely unless Otaman yields to these socialists at most."

ukrsoc.267.t: "'Treaty of Myrhorod'?"
ukrsoc.267.d: "The ongoing tensions between Otaman Petliura's government and the Borotbysts, who control the south-eastern region, have reached a critical juncture. Recent overtures for peace signal that both sides recognize the need to avoid a full-scale war and are willing to find common ground. Under this mindset, the leaders have agreed to sit down for negotiations, which have come to be known as the Treaty of Myrhorod. With Otaman Petliura and Borotbysts' leader Shumskyi poised for dialogue, the future of Ukraine hangs in the balance.\n\nThe talks' central issues include the establishment of people's councils, land socialization, and the possibility of a Ukrainian socialist republic. The Borotbysts demand either free establishment of people's councils or full socialization of land, and Petliura must choose which of these terms to accept. A more radical solution, the full socialization of land, would undoubtedly weaken Petliura's popularity among the nation, while the former option is seen as a compromise.\n\nThe Treaty of Myrhorod could solidify a ceasefire between the factions and alter the course of Ukraine's history. However, successful negotiations are far from guaranteed. Without agreement on either the establishment of people's councils or land socialization, discussions may collapse, sending both sides back to the brink of all-out conflict."

ukrsoc.268.d: "In a moment that will be remembered as an outstanding display of diplomacy and compromise, a so-called 'Duumvirate' has been formed between Otaman Petliura and the Borotbysts' leader, Shumskyi, to secure peace and cooperation for the Ukrainian nation. During the negotiations, two major topics have dominated the discussion: the free establishment of people's councils and the full socialization of land. The Borotbysts have adamantly demanded one of these two points be accepted to ensure a ceasefire between the factions. \n\nIn a surprising turn of events, the two leaders have successfully navigated these demands and reached a compromise. Despite the successful negotiations witnessed during the Treaty of Myrhorod, the lingering tensions persist. The core ideological differences between the two leaders continue to strain their collaboration.\n\nThe Duumvirate is struggling to maintain control over the rising turmoil within the Ukrainian nation. Hopes of a lasting peace fade as the two factions remain divided beneath the surface, with their objectives often clashing. It becomes clear that the Treaty of Myrhorod, albeit a remarkable show of diplomacy, is merely acting as a temporary band-aid on an ever-growing wound.\n\nThe precarious truce between Petliura and Shumskyi threatens to collapse, and many fear that the much-dreaded war has only been delayed, not avoided. In the uncertain days that lie ahead, the will and determination of the Duumvirate to withstand adversity shall be severely tested."

The ideological rift between the two leaders has proven insurmountable.\n\nThe fragile hope that the Treaty of Myrhorod could prevent a full-scale civil war now lies in tatters. The unstoppable descent into chaos has commenced, with extremists on both sides exploiting the situation to further stoke the flames of division. The people of Ukraine, who once hoped for unity under a joint leadership, are now left with a bitter realization that war is inevitable.\n\nThe conflict shall ignite as both Otaman Petliura and Shumskyi retreat to their respective camps to bolster their forces and prepare for the upcoming struggle. A power struggle of massive proportions shall rage, disrupting the lives of millions of Ukrainians who must now grapple with hardships and uncertainties on a scale seldom seen in the nation's history.\n\nThe ultimate failure of the Treaty of Myrhorod shall serve as a dark reminder of the perils posed by uncompromisable ideologies, as well as the inherent fragility of alliances formed on shaky foundations. The geopolitical landscape of Ukraine has now become a battleground, with its future hanging precariously between the clashing titans of Petliura and Shumskyi."

As a loyal servant and an ardent supporter of Dyrektoria ideals, I assure you that I shall do my utmost to achieve a positive outcome.\n\nDespite our differences, I firmly believe that both sides share a deep love for Ukraine and its people. Though my own political views may lean towards the left, I have always found common ground with our fellow countrymen, even when our ideologies may diverge. It is in this spirit of unity that I accepted the role of mediator and ambassador between your esteemed headquarters and the Borotbysts.\n\nUpon successfully establishing contact with Shumskyi, I have managed to arrange a meeting between you and him for high-level talks on ending the conflict. It is my sincere hope that this rare opportunity may lead to a peaceful resolution that respects the ideals and sacrifices of both sides. To ensure a suitable environment for such a historic encounter, we have chosen the picturesque health resort near the eastern borders of Myrhorod, amidst the beautiful mixed forests of pines and birches.\n\nThe refreshing waters of the Myrhorod springs, reminiscent of Europe's finest spas, provide an apt backdrop for our endeavor towards rejuvenation and healing. In this land near your native Poltava region, we shall gather in dialogue, bearing the heavy weight of our people's dreams for a united and prosperous Ukraine.\n\nI remain, as always, a faithful servant to our cause and an unwavering patriot of Ukraine.

Amid the chaos, tragedy struck in Kyiv when Otaman Petliura was assassinated during a public speech about the necessity to resist and the ongoing turmoil. A man rushed towards Petliura and threw a bomb under his feet, killing the nation's leader in a devastating explosion. In the immediate aftermath, panic ensued, resulting in a catastrophic crowd collapse and further loss of life.\n\nWith Ukraine suddenly left without a leader, an extraordinary congress of Petliura's loyalists was called to establish a temporary collective institution, tasked with leading the nation until the Borotbysts were defeated. The future of Ukraine, however, grew increasingly bleak as the war raged on.\n\nThe assassination of Petliura not only plunged the nation into a deeper crisis but also shattered the hopes and dreams of many Ukrainians who looked up to him as a guiding force through these difficult times.\n\nAs the conflict continues, the people of Ukraine are left to wonder what will become of their nation and what lies ahead in the dark and tumultuous days to come."

At this point, secret meeting concluded that Symon Petliura should be arrested and put in the Kyiv prison for plotting against the revolution. Upon getting an information of these horrible and treacherous act, Petliura himself called his chauffeur to the Romanian border, hoping to outrun police of newly founded state. On the border of Romania, Symon Petliura was welcomed by his patron, he gave him a new identity and a villa to stay for a while."

ukrsoc.274.d: "In a tumultuous turn of events, the Petliura-Shumskyi Duumvirate crumbled under the weight of internal strife and the relentless pressure from the Borotbysts, who were growing ever more powerful and demanding. However, it was during these challenging times that Symon Petliura's strong will and cunning tactics would take center stage.\nPetliura, understanding the vulnerabilities of his nation and recognizing the destructive potential of civil war, devised a comprehensive plan to outmaneuver the Borotbysts. Through a series of well-timed and strategic moves, he managed to topple the once seemingly impregnable Borotbyst stronghold in the South-Eastern region of Ukraine.\n\nIn a surprising turn, the Borotbyst leadership found itself cornered and was ultimately arrested. This bold act led to the swift desertion of hundreds of Borotbyst-aligned soldiers, leaving the once heavily-defended and key South-Eastern cities vulnerable to takeover. Petliura's forces, seizing upon this remarkable opportunity, efficiently captured the cities, thus significantly increasing control over all of Ukraine.\n\nWith his grip on the nation now secure, Petliura moved quickly to dismantle all remnants of Borotbyst political power. He not only dissolved all structures associated with the increasingly radical group but also went to the extent of eradicating their party altogether. This decisive action sent a clear message to any remaining factions that might consider challenging his authority.\n\nAs peace was finally proclaimed throughout Ukraine, the once divided nation began to heal under Petliura's watchful eye. Although some detractors might still criticize his actions, it is largely acknowledged that Petliura's strategic maneuvering not only prevented a disastrous civil war but also allowed for the gradual recovery and stabilization of a battered nation.\n\nWith the worst of the crisis behind them, the people of Ukraine now look to Petliura for guidance in navigating the challenges that lie ahead. His vision of a united and prosperous nation will undoubtedly be tested but, for now, there is a sense of hope and optimism that Ukraine's darkest days may be relegated to the past."

However, as tensions escalated and the partnership inevitably deteriorated, the nation descended into disarray. The desperate scramble for power led to the breakdown of any Petliura-aligned local governments and the collapse of central authority.\n\nAgainst this tumultuous backdrop, a dramatic twist of fate unfolded: Symon Petliura, the once-beloved leader who found himself floundering in a sea of political chaos, devised a cunning strategy to regain control. Working behind the scenes, Petliura deftly manipulated events to revive his influence and strengthen his renewed position as the Supreme Otaman of the Army.\n\nUltimately, it was Petliura alone who emerged victorious in this Revolution, remaining Chief of Army, while a new Socialist Republic was proclaimed. Not everyone approved of his maneuvering, with many branding him a traitor, but to the people of Ukraine and the rank-and-file soldiers, Petliura's actions have averted a deadly and destructive civil war.\n\nAs the dust settles, a new era dawns under Borotbysts' leadership of a socialist Ukraine. While detractors may still question Petliura's loyalties, the nation looks toward the future, cautiously optimistic that this unexpected turn may lead to a brighter tomorrow for all Ukrainians."

The fragile political tapestry holding the Duumvirate together has unraveled, and it appears that the Petliura-Shumskyi alliance has failed to stand the test of time.\n\nThe collapse of the coalition has led to the disintegration of Petliura-aligned local governments and a catastrophic crumbling of central authority. In the midst of this chaos, a revolution has erupted, with the Borotbysts seizing the opportunity to establish themselves as the victors.\n\nThe volatile situation has culminated in the proclamation of a new Socialist Republic, a testament to the relentless determination and ideological ambition of the Borotbysts. As the dust settles, the fledgling Socialist Republic faces the daunting task of managing the deep-seated animosity and fractures left in the wake of the Petliura-Shumskyi duumvirate.\n\nThe future of Ukraine now rests on the shoulders of these determined revolutionaries, who must chart a new path for a nation recovering from political turmoil and upheaval. With the Petliura-Shumskyi chapter closed, the Borotbysts-led Socialist Republic must rise to the challenge and navigate the treacherous road ahead."

Since their inception in the South-East, all Borotbyst newspapers and other publications expressing support for Shumskyi's policies have been banned by Petliura's orders. To solidify the coalition and ensure peace for Ukraine, the Borotbysts now demand that the ban be revoked, allowing their press to be published freely.\n\nWhile conceding on this issue might demonstrate Petliura's willingness to compromise with the Borotbysts, it could also disrupt the current status quo and entice more Ukrainians to support the Borotbyst cause. Thus, Otaman Petliura faces a difficult decision: either legalise the press to maintain a fragile peace or stand firm to preserve the established order."
ukrsoc.276.a: "Legalise the Borotbyst press - demonstrate goodwill."
ukrsoc.276.b: "We should not make our people fools!"

ukrsoc.277.t: "The Question of Legalising Radas"
ukrsoc.277.d: "As the negotiations of the 'Treaty of Myrhorod' have ended with promises, Otaman Petliura faced a difficult decision regarding these promises made to Shumskyi's Borotbysts. In an effort to find common ground, Petliura has proposed the idea of legalising local peasant councils, or Radas, as the only true revolutionary self-government institutions in the country. Unlike the centralised government or USDRP-controlled Radas, these Borotbyst Councils would be free to disseminate information and even adopt legislation on a local level. \n\nWhile this step may demonstrate Petliura's willingness to compromise with the Borotbysts, it also poses significant risks, potentially weakening central authority and opening the door to internal instability. Now, with the pressure of the negotiations mounting, Petliura must decide whether to go through with the legalisation of Radas, or change course, risking a possible breakdown of the fragile peace."
ukrsoc.277.a: "Honor the proposal and legalise the Radas."
ukrsoc.277.b: "Not a chance to influence our peasants!"

ukrsoc.278.t: "Anti-Corruption Committee"
ukrsoc.278.d: "As part of the ongoing negotiations between Otaman Petliura and the Shumskyi-led Borotbysts, a significant proposition arises in the form of an Anti-Corruption Committee to operate throughout Ukraine. Shumskyi proposes that this committee be formed to tackle corrupt practices plaguing the nation, with the caveat that management and control of the institution should fall under Borotbyst jurisdiction.\n\nOtaman Petliura, while generally receptive to the notion of an Anti-Corruption Committee, is concerned about potential political bias stemming from Borotbyst control. To mitigate this risk, he has the option to approve the establishment of such a committee, but without granting control to the Borotbysts, thereby preserving its neutrality. However, pursuing this course of action may provoke outrage from the Borotbysts and threaten the delicate balance of power in the ongoing negotiations."
ukrsoc.278.a: "Approved."
ukrsoc.278.b: "Great idea! But we should not give control to the Borotbysts!"

ukrsoc.279.t: "Petliura-Borotbyst Coalition Secured!"
ukrsoc.279.d: "Following a long series of negotiations between Otaman Petliura and the Shumskyi-led Borotbysts, a groundbreaking agreement has been reached, securing a coalition between the two factions and paving the way for much-needed reforms in Ukraine. The Petliura-Borotbyst Coalition symbolizes a new chapter in Ukrainian history as it strives for unity and progress amidst a turbulent era.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the peasant Radas have been legalized, granting the Borotbysts a legitimate platform to voice their concerns and influence policy. Additionally, the Borotbyst press has been granted full legal status, alluding to a freer and more diverse media landscape in Ukraine. Furthermore, the establishment of a Borotbyst-led Anti-Corruption Committee signals the coalition's dedication to tackling widespread corruption and fostering transparency.\n\nAlthough these concessions represent a significant step toward unity and cooperation, it remains to be seen whether the coalition will stand the test of time as potential conflicts may arise between the former adversaries. Regardless, the formation of the Petliura-Borotbyst Coalition marks a historic moment for Ukraine and sets the stage for significant change."

ukrsoc.280.t: "Petliura Ousted From Office!"
ukrsoc.280.d: "For several months, the uneasy diarchy between Symon Petliura and Andriy Melnyk has ruled Ukraine, attempting to maintain a balance of power under increasingly unstable conditions. However, the fragile alliance between Petliura's loyalist forces and Melnyk's Sich Striltsi and UVO has continued to strain under the pressures of political and military conflict. Both sides have struggled to assert their dominance, but it seems that Melnyk and his nationalist supporters have now emerged victorious.\n\nSymon Petliura has been ousted from office and forcibly removed from his position within the joint leadership. His loyalist troops, who once fought alongside the Sich Striltsi, have now been disbanded. In a special address to the nation, Andriy Melnyk has announced the retirement of Petliura and the transfer of all power to a newly formed, fully nationalist government.\n\nWith this new nationalist government at the helm, the people of Ukraine can expect to see a renewed focus on establishing the Ukrainian National State along its ethnic borders, as envisioned by Melnyk and his supporters. The future of Ukraine now rests in the hands of this newly empowered nationalist regime, and the people watch with anticipation as it moves to consolidate its rule and set the course for the nation's destiny."

Despite a tense atmosphere, both parties have come to realize the importance of maintaining an uneasy equilibrium for the sake of Ukraine's unity and strength.\n\nIn an unprecedented move, both Petliura and Melnyk have agreed to preserve the status-quo, upholding the delicate balance of power and co-existing as joint leaders. They have each acknowledged the support that their respective factions hold and the potential consequences should one side attempt to overthrow the other. \n\nBoth leaders have issued a joint statement, emphasizing that although their leadership may be divided, Ukraine remains a united and strong nation that will not be torn apart by internal conflict. They have called upon their followers to set aside their differences and work together for the betterment of the country."
ukrsoc.281.a: "Diarchy stands firm, a testament to unity in diversity."

ukrsoc.282.t: "An Unexpected Guest"
ukrsoc.282.d: "During a routine recon operation in one of the vast forest lands of the Ukraine, a squad of Petliura loyalists has encountered a most peculiar sight. Hearing rumblings from an isolated plain framed by a ring of pines the soldiers decided to investigate, and much to their surprise encountered a group of around fifty fighting-age men clothed in purely black uniforms, seemingly trying to stash caches of weapons and ammunition. Despite not being outwardly hostile, they still had to be disarmed, lest it turns out they are Borotbyst or even Monarchist counterrevolutionaries.\nPerhaps the most bizzare revelation was the once concerning the officer of this whole group, who turned out to be none other than the former King Vasyl I, now going by Vasyl Vyshyvanyi. During the impromptu investigation by the Petliurists he explained that hearing of the recent events in the Ukraine the former king managed to organize a small group of volunteers willing to serve the new Republic and combat the 'Red Menace' which would threaten it in any way Petliura can see fit. The soldiers themselves did not have the authority to pass judgement on Vyshyvanyi, and thus had to await the final decision sent from Kyiv regarding the fate of the now-disgraced monarch."

ukrsoc.283.d: "With the growing political role of Otaman Petliura, it was decided to remove him for his position as the Chief Otaman of the Armed Forces, instead we must choose a more reliable and non-ambitious person, when it comes to political affairs. This choice is not easy, however, as entrusting the whole Armed Forces to the new Otaman will cost us some authority."

ukrsoc.284.t: "Rooting Out The UVO Radicals"
ukrsoc.284.d: "The Petliura-Melnyk diarchy is currently facing great challenges, with the strengthening of radical factions within the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO) being one of the most pressing issues. The radical wing of the UVO, led by Mykola Stsiborskyi, has become increasingly dangerous to Ukrainian stability and democracy. Similarly, the far-right clique of Dontsov's Integralists, though smaller in size, is just as menacing.\n\nIn a decisive maneuver, Andriy Melnyk seeks to rally the party under the 'Old Guard' with his leadership. Simultaneously, the civilian USDRP administration perceives the radical wings as a threat to the stability of Ukraine and desires to take action.\n\nBoth Melnyk's 'Old Guard' and the USDRP are determined to tackle the growing influence of the radical factions within the UVO. Together, they devise strategies aimed at weakening the radical wings, bolstering moderate factions within the UVO while ensuring national security and the continuity of democracy.\n\nAs a result of their combined efforts, the radical wings within the UVO find themselves under immense pressure to reconsider their aggressive stance and perhaps even adopt a more measured approach to Ukrainian politics."

ukrsoc.285.d: "In the wake of recent political developments in Ukraine, the urgent need for stability and the prevention of chaos has become paramount. Recognizing this critical requirement, military leaders and politicians have joined forces to establish military-civilian administrations throughout the regions. This collaborative effort aims to leverage the strengths and expertise of both groups, ensuring effective governance and stability.\n\nBy combining the capabilities of military leaders and politicians, these administrations will work cohesively to prevent chaos and maintain order in the regions. Their coordinated efforts will swiftly address security concerns, ensuring the smooth functioning of daily life for the Ukrainian populace. Military-civilian administrations will play a crucial role in safeguarding the nation from internal and external threats. Collaborative efforts will be focused on devising and implementing comprehensive defense strategies, protecting Ukraine's territorial integrity, and preserving its national interests.\n\nThe success of this joint endeavor hinges upon the cooperation and coordination between military leaders and politicians. Through shared responsibilities and the pooling of expertise, the military-civilian administrations can effectively address challenges, ensuring stability and preventing further turmoil in Ukraine.\nThe establishment of military-civilian administrations marks a significant milestone in Ukraine's pursuit of stability.

ukrsoc.286.d: "In an effort to solidify unity and broaden the support base of the Ukrainian nation, Chief Otaman Symon Petliura's administration has taken a bold step by initiating the 'social-democratization' of the Sich Striltsi. While the Sich Striltsi primarily embodies a nationalist orientation, their unwavering loyalty to Ukraine remains undisputed. However, it is important to emphasize that embracing social democracy is not a threat to Ukrainian identity. On the contrary, the introduction of social-democratic policies aims to uplift and support our people.\n\nBy integrating the Sich Striltsi under Chief Otaman Petliura's command, this initiative aims to transform it into a less elitist and factionalist structure. This transition will help the Sich Striltsi transcend partisan divisions and ensure their apolitical nature. By embracing a unified command, we can enhance coordination, effectiveness, and discipline within the ranks, enabling us to face future challenges as a united force.\n\nIt is crucial to emphasize that social-democratization does not dilute or undermine the nationalistic fervor and dedication of the Sich Striltsi. On the contrary, this transformative process seeks to strengthen their commitment to Ukraine by providing tangible benefits to the Ukrainian people. By fostering social cohesion, inclusivity, and fairness, we can forge a more prosperous and harmonious future for all.\nIt is essential that the Sich Striltsi understand that social democracy is not a disease for Ukrainians. Rather, it is a means to empower our people, ensuring their well-being and securing a brighter future for generations to come. The integration of social-democratic policies and the apolitical nature of the Sich Striltsi under Chief Otaman Petliura's command will pave the way for a stronger and more united Ukraine.\n\nAs we embark on this transformative journey, let us remember that our ultimate goal is to safeguard the interests of the Ukrainian people. By embracing social democracy and consolidating the Sich Striltsi under a unified command, we can build a society that thrives on the principles of justice, equality, and national pride."

He suggests three key areas where their alliance could make a significant impact:\n\nNeutrality and Non-Aligned Status emerges as the first focal point. The ULD(S-F) proposes adopting a policy of neutrality, ensuring Ukraine's independence and minimizing the risk of external aggression. This approach seeks to foster stability within the region and safeguard the country's sovereignty.\n\nThe second point of discussion revolves around Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreements. Nikovskyi argues for prioritizing economic collaboration, aiming to stimulate growth and attract investments. By forging trade agreements with other nations, Ukraine can enhance its economic standing and secure a brighter future for its people.\n\nLastly, the concept of Liberal Reforms and Individual Freedoms takes center stage. The ULD(S-F) advocates for implementing liberal reforms that uphold individual freedoms and protect human rights.

They argue that by utilizing the Councils, a broader range of voices can be heard, ensuring a more inclusive and participatory decision-making process.\n\nAdditionally, the right faction of the USDRP emphasizes the importance of social security measures and progressive taxation on businesses. They believe that a fair and balanced approach to taxation, particularly targeting businesses, will enable the government to provide essential social services and support to the people of Ukraine.\n\nPetliura carefully considers their proposals, recognizing the potential benefits they may bring to the coalition.

However, the newly formed UNS faces significant challenges, as internal power struggles and ideological differences threaten the stability and order of the nation.\n\nThe UNS represents a fragile union between the social-democratic and liberal factions, with each faction vying for greater influence and control within the coalition. The social-democratic wing, led by Isaak Mazepa, seeks to push forward their progressive policies aimed at social equality and justice. Meanwhile, the liberal faction, led by Andriy Nikovskyi, emphasizes the importance of individual freedoms, economic liberalism, and a market-oriented approach.\n\nPetliura, as the leader of the coalition, finds himself at the center of this intricate power dynamic. The delicate balance between the factions demands constant attention and skilled navigation to prevent one side from feeling isolated or marginalized. If either faction becomes too disenchanted with their influence within the UNS, they possess the capability to leave the union and potentially overthrow both Petliura and the opposing faction, plunging Ukraine into further chaos."

As the dust begins to settle, Chief Otaman Symon Petliura is faced with a weighty decision that will shape the future of Ukraine.\n\nWith the political situation becoming more stable, Petliura contemplates the path ahead and the choices he must make to ensure Ukraine's long-term well-being. Two possible decisions loom before him, each carrying its own implications for the nation's governance and stability.\n\nOne option is for Petliura to step down as the nation's leader and announce new elections, while retaining his position as Chief Otaman. This decision would emphasize a commitment to democratic principles and the belief in the importance of a fair and transparent political process. It signals a willingness to allow the people of Ukraine to determine their future leaders through a democratic election.\n\nAlternatively, Petliura could choose to secure his power as the nation's eternal president until true stability is achieved.

Their campaign emphasizes the importance of maintaining the hard-fought unity achieved under Petliura's leadership, while also promising to address remaining threats and safeguard Ukraine's order.\n\nChallenging the UNS's dominance is the Revolutionary Alliance, an amalgamation of the Ukrainian Communist Party (UKP) and the Ukrainian Party of Socialist Revolutionaries (UPSR). Led by Vasyl Shakhrai and Mykola Kovalevskyi, respectively, the Revolutionary Alliance seeks to champion their distinct ideologies. The UKP advocates for an independent Soviet Ukraine, Ukrainianization, and the dictatorship of the proletariat, emphasizing national-communist principles. On the other hand, the UPSR, inspired by the ideas of Drahomaniv and Chernov, promotes socialism through democracy, with a focus on Ukrainian cultural and national development.\n\nAs the pre-election campaigns unfold, the UNS rallies support, leveraging their successful coalition and touting their track record in stabilizing the nation.

Under the pressure and the threat of further internal strife, Petliura reluctantly agrees to dissolve the Ukrainian National Union, effectively dismantling the coalition.\n\nThe dissolution of the UNS marks a significant shift in Ukrainian politics.

Mazepa and the Ukrainian Social Democratic Labour Party (USDRP) now hold the reins of authority, vowing to establish a government rooted in democratic values, social justice, and equal opportunities for all Ukrainians.\n\nThis transfer of power signals a departure from the previous regime's policies and sets the stage for a new era in Ukrainian governance.

The right-wing faction, under the leadership of Andriy Nikovskyi, becomes increasingly discontented with the concessions made by the UNS to the Mazepa's USDRP. Fueled by their ideological differences and a growing sense of disillusionment, the right-wing faction executes a daring self-coup, resulting in the disbandment of the National Union and the emergence of a solely liberal government.\n\nNikovskyi's faction vehemently opposes the perceived compromises with the USDRP, asserting that they undermine the core principles and values of the right-wing movement. They argue for a more assertive and uncompromising approach in pursuing their vision of a market-driven economy, individual freedoms, and limited government intervention. Nikovskyi and his supporters believe that a purely liberal government can better safeguard these principles and foster an environment conducive to economic growth and personal liberty.\n\nAs a consequence of the self-coup, Chief Otaman Petliura, caught between the warring factions, is compelled to dissolve the Ukrainian National Union and form a new government composed solely of liberal-minded politicians. This significant shift in power paves the way for a liberal-dominated administration that seeks to prioritize free-market policies, deregulation, and the protection of individual rights and freedoms.\n\nThe new liberal government aims to implement a range of reforms, including economic liberalization measures, the promotion of foreign investment, and the removal of bureaucratic barriers. It seeks to foster an environment conducive to entrepreneurship, innovation, and private sector growth.

They argue that Petliura's policies and concessions have compromised Ukraine's sovereignty and independence, and they vow to restore a sense of national pride and democracy.\n\nWith Petliura removed, Nikovskyi assumes the role of interim president, determined to steer Ukraine towards a more national-democratic trajectory. Under his leadership, the government pledges to prioritize Ukrainian national interests and pursue policies that safeguard Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nNikovskyi's government garners significant support from national-democratic groups like the UPSS, who share their vision of a strong, independent Ukraine.

ukrsoc.300.d: "Under the leadership of Isaak Mazepa and his left coalition, comprised of the USDRP, the UPSR and the UKP, the Ukrainian government issues a proclamation calling for general elections, marking a crucial step in the democratic process. At the same time, the liberals, represented by the ULD(S-F), have formed a national-democratic coalition with the UPSS and Mykola Mikhnovskyi, the trailblazer behind the idea of Ukrainian sovereignty, known as the 'first Ukrainian nationalist.' This broad coalition seeks to bring together diverse political factions, including national-socialists, conservatives, and various militarists and nationalists, to foster a pluralistic society and address the challenges facing Ukraine. The upcoming elections represent an opportunity for the Ukrainian people to shape their nation's future guided by progressive ideologies or a commitment to Ukrainian sovereignty."

Simultaneously, the left coalition has been formed by Isaak Mazepa, comprising the UDSRP, the UPSR, and the UKP, stands as a united leftist front. Nikovskyi's coalition, while promoting liberal democracy and pragmatic civil nationalism, acknowledges the presence and diversity of other political voices. This election represents an opportunity for the Ukrainian people to exercise their democratic rights and participate in shaping the future of their country."

ukrsoc.335.t: "Conflict Among the Chervona Armia General Staff"
ukrsoc.335.d: "As the Ukrainian nation struggles to build a formidable army in the face of increasing challenges, the [GetUkrainianParliamentName] made the strategic decision to invite the Soviet Military Mission, headed by Yefym Schadenko, to construct the Ukrainian army on the model of the Russian Red Army. While this decision seemingly demonstrates the commitment to a strong and unified military force, it has unwittingly sown the seeds of discontent among the Ukrainian socialist generals.\nHaving led their troops through numerous battles (some of which were against the Soviet generals) and earned their stripes, these proud generals are fiercely loyal to their homeland and staunchly opposed to the prospect of bowing to external leadership. The presence of the Soviet Military Mission has sparked heated debates in the military circles, with some officers demanding that Schadenko's influence be kept to a minimum.\nDespite the initial intent for collaboration, it was largely the Government's step, not of the Ukrainian socialist generals. Now they express concerns that their military would become but a mere extension of the Russian forces – a prospect that sits uneasily with those who value the distinct identity and autonomy of the Ukrainian nation. Their growing resentment threatens to derail the proposed partnership, as they argue that their nation's security and independence must not be compromised at any cost.\n\nAs this delicate situation unfolds, leaders on all sides must tread carefully to balance the need for a powerful military force with the ever-present concern for maintaining national sovereignty and pride. The path ahead is fraught with challenges, as factions risk drifting further apart at a time when unity is perhaps more vital than ever."

ukrsoc.336.d: "As the lingering tension between the Ukrainian socialist generals and the Soviet Military Mission, led by Yefym Schadenko, reaches a boiling point, one particular general, Omelian Volokh, defiantly refuses to stand by idly as he perceives his cherished military institution succumbing to foreign influence. A man of passion and deep conviction, Volokh rallies like-minded officers and soldiers, sparking an insurgency in the name of protecting Ukrainian pride and independence.\n\nNews of Volokh's actions rapidly travels across the country, stirring unrest and inflaming a burning sense of nationalism among many in the armed forces. This insurgency, however, is not merely a chaotic rebellion. Operating with cunning precision, General Volokh manages to secure control of a significant portion of the military's resources and infrastructure, significantly bolstering his cause.\n\nSimultaneously alarmed and intrigued by the ferocity and determination displayed by the insurrection, many within the Ukrainian political and military spheres find themselves mulling over the question: Can the power and influence of the Volokh Insurgency transform the balance of power and forge a new path for the Ukrainian nation, driven by the unwavering resolve of dedicated patriots?\n\nAs the winds of change swirl around the embattled nation, the ultimate fate of the Ukrainian military and its people hangs in the balance. Will the impassioned cries of the Volokh Insurgency be heeded and herald a new era of self-determination? Or will the nation weather yet another storm, emerging with an uneasy unity among divided ranks?"

But as the adage goes, there's calm before the storm, and the storm that brews behind this calm is a powerful one.\n\nIrate by the perceived affront and sensing the fragility of their influence, the Russians decide to strike. Caught off-guard and reeling from the unexpected turn of events, the Ukrainian government is thrust into a state of panic when the Soviet Military Mission initiates a daring coup d'état.\n\nHaving assessed every vulnerability in the government's defenses, the Russians expertly use their troops stationed in Kyiv to swiftly and ruthlessly seize control of key strategic locations throughout the capital. Before most of the city's population even has time to process the severity of the situation, it's over. The Ukrainian government crumbles under the iron grip of this calculated insurgence.\n\nUkrainian officials are arrested and detained in undisclosed locations under close scrutiny of their Russian captors, as the once independent nation is swiftly converted into a puppet state. A pall falls over the great city of Kyiv as citizens come to terms with the reality that their nation's sovereignty has been sharply undercut, leaving a somber disquiet in its wake."

A group of Russian Bolsheviks, claiming to be the Ukrainian Communist Party of Bolsheviks (KP(b)U), was elected as the new \"legitimate\" People's Council of All-Ukraine. Led by a Yevhenia Bosh, the group consists mostly of ethnic Russians claiming loyalty to Ukraine.\n\nHowever, it quickly becomes evident that this council is nothing more than a facade orchestrated by those who overthrew the Ukrainian government. The \"True\" People's Council lacks real influence and legitimacy, and it becomes clear that their rise to power is solely backed by Russian forces seeking to manipulate and control Ukraine.\n\nThe deception does not take long for the general population to uncover, and the people's trust in the "True" People's Council evaporates quickly. With eyes set firmly on the capital, Yevhenia Bosh delivers a rousing speech asserting the legitimacy of their newly-formed council.\nAs people are not convinced by the intentions of the council, the lingering doubt only serves to create anxiety and division amongst the people, whose faith has been severely shaken by recent events.\nThe actions of the People's Council ripple through the beleaguered country, leaving the populace to wonder whether this new force might be just another means to ensure its subjugation under Russian control."

The facade of this supposedly independent government is paper-thin, and the Ukrainian people see right through their lies.\n\nIt becomes evident that the People's Secretariate's only purpose is to legitimize the hostile takeover of the country, acting as a puppet to the Russians who pull the strings from behind the scenes. The citizens of Ukraine recognize this charade for what it is - a blatant attempt to subjugate their nation under the guise of freedom and socialism.\n\nRumors of discontent and resistance begin to stir within the streets, as people refuse to accept their new reality. They exchange whispers of defiance, fueled by the simmering anger against the puppet government and the Russians who control them."

Despite the pretense of a democratic process and a sense of anticipation that hangs in the air, the outcome of the election is already a foregone conclusion.\n\nBright banners and political slogans embellish the cityscape, plastered on walls and draped across buildings, glorifying the People's Secretariat and their vision for the future of Ukraine. Amid the orchestrated pomp and propaganda, it becomes painfully evident that behind the veneer of celebration and optimism, the true face of the event is a shameless power grab by Moscow's chosen puppet.\n\nThe members of the People's Council, all loyal to Bosh and the KP(b)U, cast their votes in a unanimous show of support for their leader. The farcical nature of the election becomes clear as Yevhenia Bosh is triumphantly declared the new Premier of the Republic, tightening Moscow's grip on the struggling nation.\nAs Bosh assumes the mantle of Premier, the citizens of Ukraine are filled with growing resentment, sensing their hopes of a truly independent government snuffed out just as it had been kindled. What little faith they had in the fairness of the political process disappears almost entirely, replaced by a deepening cynicism and the realization that their fight for freedom is far from over.\nIn the shadow of Bosh's triumph, the true struggle for Ukraine's future is taking shape, as the people refuse to submit to the machinations of a puppet government and begin planting the seeds of a resilient uprising. The newly-proclaimed 'Premier' would do well to keep her eyes open, for such seeds, once sown, can bloom into a devastating tempest that no amount of force can quell."

Witnessing the farce that has become of the election, [ROOT.GetLeader] cannot stand idly by while the nation he loves is smothered beneath the weight of Moscow's control.\nDespite the danger lurking inconspicuously in every corner, [ROOT.GetLeader] boldly rallies the people in an effort to incite widespread unrest against the puppet government. His passionate speeches and stirring calls-to-action echo in the heart of Kyiv, inspiring citizens to resist the poison that threatens to consume them.\nThe unease and disquiet that once plagued the nation rapidly evolve into a roaring inferno of dissent. Knowing that history is on their side and that Ukraine's future belongs to them, [ROOT.GetLeader]'s followers rise to face the puppet government with defiance in their hearts.\nHowever, the whispers of rebellion cannot avoid detection for long. Soon enough, [ROOT.GetLeader] is arrested by Bosh's forces and thrown into jail, accused of treacherous crimes against the Republic. Imprisoned and stripped of his dignity and influence, [ROOT.GetLeader] remains a symbol of hope that continues to burn brightly in the people's hearts.\n\nIn their quest to suppress dissent, the puppet government welcomes a zealous force of Moscow's troops onto Ukrainian soil. Enraged by any semblance of resistance, these soldiers descend upon Kyiv with a fury unmatched, unleashing a reign of terror upon its citizens.\nThe atrocities committed during these dark days will never be forgotten, forever seared into the memories of those who witness them. As every act of ruthless brutality reaffirms the people's determination to resist foreign influence, the seeds of an unyielding revolution continue to germinate beneath the bloodstained soil of Kyiv.

The sinister machinations of Yevhenia Bosh's government extend their reach into the once-proud ranks of the military, hell-bent on purging any figures of sway who may support the cause of Ukraine's independence. Not even heroes such as Oleksandr Udovychenko, Vsevolod Petriv, Ivan Honcharenko, and Hryhoriy Syrotenko remain unscathed by this brutal wave of purges.\nHaving risen through the ranks of the military and earning the unwavering loyalty of their subordinates, these esteemed leaders stand as the bulwark of Ukraine against Moscow's unblinking gaze. However, the fear-driven stranglehold that Bosh's puppet government holds over the region refuses to loosen its grip on these formidable commanders.\nThe purges commence with sinister subtlety, first through baseless allegations of corruption and misconduct. As these charges fail to deter the stalwart dedication of the targeted men, the puppet government displays its sinister resolve by resorting to threats and the inevitable unwarranted arrests. Under immense pressure, families and lives of these esteemed commanders come under siege, haplessly thrust into a looming nightmare where trust becomes a fragile commodity.\nAs the purge reaches its peak, the once-undisputed pillars of the Ukrainian military are cruelly cast aside, replaced by unreliable Moscow loyalists. What remains of a once-great force crumbles into disarray, its members uncertain of whom they can trust.\n\nIn the shadows of this shattered defense, the resilient spirit of those who still harbor a passion for their homeland's freedom refuses to succumb. The names of Udovychenko, Petriv, Honcharenko, and Syrotenko echo as whispers of hope amidst the sorrowful cries of those affected by the destruction wrought by the unhinged puppet government. And among these whispers, the simmering flames of revolution continue to spark, undulating beneath the ominous sky of uncertainty and foreshadowing a fateful uprising against the dark forces at play."

In a wanton display of absolute control, these rulers, propped up by their masters in Moscow, enact sweeping measures to silence any whisper of dissent that may emerge from the local political ranks.\nOne by one, all political parties of Ukrainian origin come under fire, regardless of their affiliation or ideology. Even those with a history of support for the communist and social democrat causes find themselves in the precarious position of being deemed \"nationalist\" by this vile regime. From the shadows of their conniving plotting, the puppet masters deem these institutions enemies to the state and threaten them with brutal consequences for their defiance.\nThis ruthless assault on the heart of the Ukrainian political landscape does not discriminate against the fickle nature of ideologies. For the true intent of this campaign is to root out and eliminate all avenues of resistance against the looming designs of foreign influence.\n\nAs the suffocating silence of oppression blankets the once-vibrant chambers of Ukrainian politics, the spirit of the nation is pushed to the brink of despair.

Such deceitful rhetoric serves to justify the mass arrests and detainment of these once-prominent leaders.\nThe prison doors slam shut on the architects of Ukraine's political aspirations, casting these champions of democracy into the unforgiving depths of despair. Yet even as they languish within the cold, desolate walls of their confinement, the hallowed memories of their noble cause continue to motivate a fervent outcry against the puppet government's oppressive grasp.\n\nWhispers of dissent fill the forbidding silence of the prison cells, as the indomitable spirit of the Ukrainian nationalist struggle refuses to be extinguished.

Anchoring itself with unwavering determination, Bosh's regime courageously ushers in a new era of martial law and initiates a general mobilization in an attempt to restore order among the unsettled masses.\nAnnouncing martial law from the beleaguered heart of the nation, the puppet government casts the dark, foreboding shadow of war over the land. With every intention of crushing the increasingly vocal opposition, the regime pours its limited resources into the army, transforming what had been disorganized remnants of a battered military into a more formidable and unified force.\nConsequently, the already weakened populace now struggles beneath the weight of increasing conscription, sparking yet more distrust and resistance against Bosh's rule. Men are ruthlessly conscripted into the rapidly expanding armed forces, tearing families and communities apart as the indiscriminate demands of the government's military ambitions descend upon them.\nAs the chilling breath of martial law settles over a weary Ukraine, echoes of dissent gradually crescendo into a cacophony of anger, frustration, and seething resistance. The puppet government, mistaking these voices for the howls of violent nationalism and reactionary fervor, redoubles its efforts to snuff out the smoldering conflagration before it has the chance to ignite a revolution.\n\nFear and defiance become an inseparable pair, entwining themselves around the hearts of the Ukrainian people as they navigate the grim reality of martial law and forced conscription."

Individuals who dare to oppose the government are met with brutal crackdowns and a swift end to their rebellion. Media censorship becomes widespread, and the once-thriving community of artists, intellectuals, and political activists now find themselves silenced by the unyielding grip of totalitarian control.\nMeanwhile, conscription brings countless young men into the fold of the military, bolstering the ranks of the now-unified and better-equipped armed forces. A rigorous campaign of indoctrination takes hold, attempting to erase the resistance mindset that had once fanned the flames of dissent. Over time, this blood-and-iron policy serves to create a climate of fear and oppression in the country, as neighbors begin to inform on one another to the omnipresent state security apparatus.\n\nWhile the Yevhenia Bosh's government revels in the seemingly unyielding stranglehold they now maintain over Ukraine, the spirit of independence continues to burn brightly within the hearts of countless Ukrainians. Unable to suppress the flames of nationalism indefinitely, the government's actions serve only to strengthen the resolve of those who dream of a free Ukraine. As these quiet, unbroken whispers of defiance merge into a symphony of silent resolve, the ultimate fate of Ukraine hangs in the balance - a nation caught between the crushing grip of tyranny and the unwavering resolve of its people."

Having suppressed all opposition and crushed the fervent calls to arms for a free Ukraine, Bosh's demise sends shockwaves rippling through the political landscape and leaves a vacuum of power in its wake.\nEven more surprising than the Bolsheviks' rise to power, is the rise of an unlikely successor to the mantle of Ukrainian premier - an unassuming and unimpressive figure from the peasant family of Kursk Region in Russia, Nikita Khrushchev. Largely dismissed as a dullard and lacking in political savvy, Khrushchev nevertheless grasps the reins of power in a country desperate for change - unanimously elected in Russian tradition, he was chosen mostly for his charisma and undoubted loyalty.\nWhile Khrushchev lacks the ruthless authority that Yevhenia Bosh had, his unexpected rise to power provides a glimmer of hope for those who seek a brighter future for Ukraine. This hope, although tempered by lingering doubts and a deep-rooted mistrust for authority, is enough to spark renewed dreams of a better chapter for Ukraine and its citizenry.\n\nThe winds of change have begun to blow across the once bleak landscape of Bolshevist-controlled Ukraine. The iron-laced fist of Yevhenia Bosh is no more, and in its place, new political powers are at work, led by the unassuming figure of Nikita Khrushchev. While the journey ahead is far from certain, the spirit of the Ukrainian people remains resilient and the flame of resistance still glows in the shadows, igniting the unyielding belief that a brighter future might yet lie ahead."

He promises to relax the iron grip of censorship and promote artistic expression, paving the way for a more just and open society. The people, also yearning for change, are taken aback by this dramatic transformation in policy.\nHowever, behind the scenes, the reality is far from this utopian vision. As Khrushchev talks of greater openness, secret plans are initiated to maintain control over key aspects of society. Security is tightened across all levels of governance, suppressing any signs of self-determination within the Communist Party. Surveillance and intimidation become the norm for many, as the nation's leaders seek to monitor the lives of its citizens.\n\nDespite these hidden maneuvers, the citizens of Ukraine remain largely unaware of the underlying control efforts.

With this decision, Khrushchov seeks to forge an alliance with the Ukapists as part of his Ukrainization efforts. \n\nTo the astonishment of the Ukrainian people, Khrushchov invites prominent members of the previously persecuted political party to join the ranks of the government. As they are welcomed with open arms, the former outlawed Ukapists are now provided with a platform to voice their ideas and influence policy-making within Ukraine. \nThis strategic move is seen by many as a genuine attempt by [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] to build stronger connections with Ukrainians. He believes that this approach will help foster a sense of unity and ensure the long-term stability of Ukraine's political structure. However, some skeptics view this act as a calculated method to subdue potential opposition and maintain control through the incorporation of these prominent figures into his regime. \nAs [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] welcomes the Ukapists into the fold, Ukrainian society is left torn between hopes of a truly representative and inclusive government and doubts over the sincerity of these bold gestures."

This move is part of Khrushchov's efforts to create a more Ukrainian 'Ukrainian' government.\n\nVynnychenko, once arrested by Bosh for his nationalist tendencies, experiences a meteoric rise to power as he is elevated from prisoner to a prominent government figure overnight. As Khrushchov's right-hand man, Vynnychenko is expected to be the face of the new, more inclusive Ukrainian government.\nHowever, Khrushchov takes careful steps to ensure Vynnychenko's influence remains limited. He introduces the position of First Secretary, which he assumes for himself, effectively maintaining ultimate control over the government's direction and policy-making. This calculated move sparks further skepticism among the Ukrainian people about Khrushchov's intentions behind his restructuring efforts.\n\nDespite doubts surrounding the sincerity of Khrushchov's actions, Vynnychenko's appointment represents a monumental shift in Ukraine's political structure, with citizens feeling both conflicted and hopeful about the changes that are taking place.

In an unexpected turn of events, Khrushchov mandates that all new members of the government join the KP(b)U party, solidifying the stronghold of the one-party state in Ukraine. The opposition remains stifled, casting doubts over the sincerity of Khrushchov's liberalization efforts.\n\nKhrushchov's move to maintain the one-party state in Ukraine defies the expectations of those who believed the appointment of Vynnychenko signaled a step towards a more open political atmosphere in the region. The persistence of the one-party system, despite the cosmetic changes Khrushchov has implemented, leads to widespread dissatisfaction among the Ukrainian people and further skepticism surrounding Khrushchov's true intentions.\n\nThis development highlights a unique and highly controversial interpretation of 'liberalization,' as Khrushchov continues to exercise ultimate control over both the government and the narrative surrounding his political advances. It remains to be seen whether meaningful reform will emerge or if these actions will only serve to further entrench the existing political power structure in Ukraine. The future of genuine liberalization efforts in the region hinges upon the ability of political figures such as Vynnychenko to navigate the complex politics and potentially challenge Khrushchov's monopoly on power."

Under the facade of internationalist slogans and unity of the Russian and Ukrainian peoples, Khrushchev's secret plan aims at stealthily integrating Russian officials and settlers into key government positions and influential roles in Ukrainian society. This maneuver seeks to ensure the stability of the Ukrainian one-party system led by Khrushchev's KP(b)U party and to thwart any potential resurgence of opposition parties.\n\nBy painstakingly maintaining an image of international cooperation and unity, Khrushchev's scheme remains unnoticed, allowing him to pursue the Russification policy unhindered. As a result, Ukraine's cultural and political autonomy begins to erode, with the nation gradually being swallowed up by the Soviet sphere of influence.\n\nHowever, suspicions and unease simmer beneath the surface among the Ukrainian populace. While the true extent of Khrushchev's plan remains hidden, a growing sense of unease regarding Ukraine's loss of self-determination and national identity starts to emerge.

The claims of its innovation, however, seem almost laughable to those skeptical of the deviation from traditional 5-year and 4-year plans. Some cannot help but wonder how such a drastic change in timeframe could genuinely revolutionize economic progress.\n\nDespite the absurdity of [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s claims, the implementation of Ukrainization policies helps to alleviate doubts among the workers and Ukrainian public. The emphasis on celebrating and preserving their rich cultural heritage leads to a resurgent national identity, making it easier to dismiss the more outlandish promises of the Semiletka as harmless enthusiasm.\n\nUltimately, the enthusiasm of party members and Khrushchev's own vigorous promotion of both the Semiletka and Ukrainization initiatives creates a sense of optimism that allows the far-fetched promises to go unchallenged."

The previously elated mood becomes tempered, and whispers questioning the true intentions behind the Semiletka grow louder and more persistent.\n\nThe optimistic façade of Khrushchev's passionate speeches and party members' applause begins to crack under the weight of their growing skepticism. Ukrainian workers struggle to hold onto hope for a brighter future as the promises of the Semiletka become increasingly dubious, overshadowed by the rise of a subtle Russo-centric agenda."

Ukraine's black soil promoted individualism rather than collectivism, as it allowed for individual farmers to generate substantial crop yields.\n\nThe agricultural collectivisation under the Semiletka Plan largely targets the more affluent Ukrainian population, especially the 'Kulaks' –the most prosperous Ukrainian peasants who had often been successful enough to expand their farms and become more independent. These reforms aim to restructure the farming system in Ukraine, promote modernisation and efficiency, and create a united and homogeneous Ukrainian peasantry.\nThe Bolshevik authorities recognised that the Kulaks were often resistant to collectivisation, thus they were seen as an obstacle to the realisation of the Bolshevist vision. To combat this, the authorities embarked on a policy of forced collective farming, where individual land-owners were forcibly removed from their land. This policy fell particularly heavily on the Kulaks, who were perceived as a threat to the Bolshevist state due to their wealth and individualism.\nHowever, the Ukrainian population is divided about the Semiletka Plan. While some viewed the reforms as a way to promote the common good, others see it as unfairly targeting Ukrainian peasants while favouring Russian settlers who had recently migrated to Ukraine."
ukrsoc.354.d2: "In the past, Ukraine's agriculture had been largely divided between wealthy landowners of Russian and Polish origin and vastly spread smallholding farms. The black soils of Ukraine promoted individualism instead of collectivism, like in the poor-soiled Muscovite swamps and forests. As a result, the Ukrainian peasantry valued independence, land, and individual rights more than collective ownership.\n\nThe collectivisation reforms under the Semiletka Plan created a wide divide between the Ukrainian and Russian peasant populations. While targeting the affluent Ukrainian Kulaks, the Russian peasants who had migrated to Ukraine were often seen as benefiting from these policies. This situation created tensions between the Ukrainian and Russian populations, with many Ukrainians believing that they were being unfairly targeted.\n\nThe Semiletka Plan sparked a systematic expropriation campaign against the Kulaks, regarded in official Bolshevist propaganda as 'enemies of the people'. As a result, Ukrainian rural families were subjected to displacement and hardship, exacerbating existing inequalities between Ukrainian and Russian peasants.\nSeveral incentives were offered by the Bolshevist authorities to encourage peasants to join collectives, which resulted in a noticeable 'Russification' of the Ukrainian countryside. This led to fear among Ukrainians that their cultural identity and heritage were under threat."

ukrsoc.355.d: "It's been nearly a year since Chairman [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] unveiled his Semiletka plan, a spunky initiative designed to make mostly agricultural Ukraine an industrial powerhouse. Our cities have been sprawling and bursting with growth – the concrete jungles of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa are now filled with even more factories, schools, and houses. Yet, we have suddenly found ourselves under the wondrous spell of... corn!\n\nDuring his recent visit to America, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] was given an aerial tour of vast expanses of cornfields in America's heartland. Struck by the endless swaths of golden maize, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] had a momentary hallucination: he saw Ukraine as a gigantic basket of Corn – a sight so astonishing it brought tears to his eyes. Bewildered at the sight of [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s emotional epiphany, the perplexed American pilot landed among the cornstalks.\n\nUpon [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s return, he enthusiastically preached to the Party elites about the wonders of corn. With ardent conviction, he insisted: \"If corn can build such a nation like America, then, by Lenin's ghost, it can help us too!\" So now, our industrious plans will be expanded with new agricultural ambitions: enormous tracts of land, stretching as far as the eye can see, will be transformed into cornfields. Workers are quickly adapting, as they transform from coal miners to corn huskers.\n\nHowever, there are whispers among the more skeptical Party members that while the Semiletka plan was ambitious, this sudden 'corn craze' could turn out to be nothing more than [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] waxing poetic about some \"cowboy capitalist\" dream. Only time can truly tell whether corn will reign supreme in our journey towards prosperity and self-imposed Ukrainisation, overshadowing the debates and struggles of Russification."

It seems his recent trip to America has left him with an insatiable appetite for inventive agricultural ventures, so the Ukrainian landscape must prepare itself for yet another transformation.\n\n[GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] has envisioned the widespread cultivation of Konoplia crops as an addition to his earlier corn-centric ambitions, declaring that Konoplia will not only hold a prominent position as Ukraine's \"other wonderplant\" but also elevate the country's economy to dizzying heights. The mass production of Konoplia will be used for medicinal and industrial purposes, providing a plethora of benefits for us all! \n\nYet, rumblings of discontent continue to arise among the skeptical Party members. They argue that the Konoplia initiative is just another of [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s grand pipedreams, with one well-known high-ranking official jokingly suggesting, \"Next, we'll be told that Comrade [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] has spoken with unicorns, and we'll be ordered to switch the horses in our stables for these mythical creatures!\"\n\nAs the industrial machinery to support the new initiative of our First Secretary is being ramped up, the debate over whether to embrace [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s plan or reject it as pure Soviet folly echoes throughout the halls of our Soviet Administration."

Our dedicated leader has orchestrated a strategic shift of recently harvested corn to plump-up legions of hungry pigs, with the intention of turning the entire Ukrainian Soviet Republic into a Porcine Paradise. No ordinary meat, comrades - this will be the finest Soviet-bred, corn-fed pork ever produced!\n\nFarmers, factory workers, and swine alike are aflutter with the buzzing energy of this high-stakes plan, now dubbed \"The Great Porkening\". As pigs feast upon the bountiful grains of Khrushchev's corn surplus, their satisfied grunts echo throughout the land, an aria of impending excess and delight.\n\nHowever, not all hearts are warmed by the chorus of these plump porkers. Certain naysaying bureaucrats take umbrage at the initiative, urging caution and pooh-poohing Khrushchev's seemingly quixotic obsession with corn-fueled pork proliferation. They caution that his grandiose vision may be, in a word, \"im-PORK-ssible\".\n\nWhat then, shall it be?

Propagated by high-ranking officials and ardent believers in the planned economy, these whispers speak of unprecedented production targets and immense surpluses in meat and milk that would bring pride to the heart of any comrade who heard them.\n\nWith word of this 'Bountiful Harvest Mirage' spreading like wildfire, none other than the chiefs of the Communist Party Committee within Ukraine have taken it upon themselves to showcase these miraculous accomplishments. These ambitious organizers have sworn to exceed meat and milk production targets, calling upon the expertise of the agrarian labor of Ukrainian peasants to help them achieve this fervent goal.\n\nHowever, while many have chosen to take this tale at face value, there are quiet doubts expressed by those who work beneath the proud communist figureheads – whispers of fabrication and embellishment in reporting production.

Workers, peasants, and even urban intellectuals have all rallied to the cause, encouraged by inspiring Party rhetoric to labor tirelessly for the betterment of the Motherland. The power of the people has been harnessed in this triumphant campaign for meat and milk supremacy.\n\nThis united effort has given rise to a series of community initiatives aiming to increase efficiency and modernize farming practices. These include innovative local co-ops, organizing workshops, and the exchange of knowledge and resources amongst agricultural producers. This genuine and enthusiastic embrace of the challenge has enkindled a sense of comradery and pride throughout the region.\n\nHowever, as the campaign stretches on, the true extent and feasibility of the production targets set by higher-ups remain uncertain. While the spirit of cooperation and resourcefulness may prevail in the short term, maintaining this momentum may prove difficult in the face of such sky-high objectives."
ukrsoc.359.d2: "In response to the cautious investigation into the reported meat and milk surpluses, a series of discrepancies and exaggerations have emerged. Eager to sustain the illusion of agricultural prowess, some local officials engaged in deceptive practices – inflating numbers and even rerouting resources from other sectors to create the appearance of abundance.\n\nWhile the discovery has not yet reached the ears of the wider Ukrainian populace, the Communist Party finds itself at a crossroads. Unveiling these falsehoods may cause disillusionment and damage [ROOT.GetLeader]'s reputation, potentially sparking political backlash. On the other hand, turning a blind eye would only perpetuate a dangerous cycle of deception and potentially push the strained agricultural sector to the breaking point.\n\nFaced with this complex situation, it is up to the Party to decide on a course of action to rectify the dilemma while ensuring the stability and pride of the Ukrainian SSR."

ukrsoc.361.d: "It appears that the cornification program initiated by [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] is not only turning Ukraine into the cornbasket of Europe but also fueling a wave of corn-related technological advances. While the overproduction of corn initially troubled party officials, they now proudly promote the creative new uses for this surplus that have emerged.\nIn agriculture, inspired by [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s fervor for corn, researchers have developed a variety of hybrid strains that display improved resilience and increased yields, much to the admiration of the party apparatus. Ukrainian factories are also embracing the corn phenomenon, experimenting with bio-materials fashioned from corn husks to supplement traditional construction materials. While early attempts at "corncrete" prove comically insufficient for practical use, research into stronger, more efficient materials continues undeterred.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukrainian scientists—under heavy encouragement from party officials—have turned their attention to corn-based biofuel, with [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] himself praising it as the innovative energy solution of the future. This ambition is comically offset by the sporadic puffs of corn-scented exhaust emanating from experimental vehicles, leaving a trail of confused and slightly amused passersby in their wake.\n\nFashion and food industries are also getting in on the corn craze, albeit less successfully. While [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] seems captivated by corn silk garments, the textile proves too delicate for daily wear. Likewise, the invention of a corn-based vodka only catches on among the most dedicated corn enthusiasts.\n\nThough somewhat comical in its excess, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s Kernel of Innovation embodies the spirit of the era—a relentless pursuit of progress, no matter how implausible or humorous the results may be. And who knows—perhaps one of these corny experiments will truly revolutionize life in Ukraine."

ukrsoc.362.d: "As [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] sat in his office, poring over the latest economic reports, a frown began to form on his brow. An aide cautiously approached, bearing news of foreign industrial achievements and advancements. With that, the tipping point was reached - [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName], fed up with the outside world leaving Ukraine in the dust, leaped to his feet and began to furiously bang his shoe on the table. His comrades sat in shock, exchanging uneasy glances as the cacophony filled the room. \n\nIt was then, with a mighty final swing, that [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s shoe slammed clean through the wooden table, shattering it in an explosion of splinters. The room fell silent, punctuated only by the wheezes of their red-faced leader. Collecting himself, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] turned on the official who'd brought him the news, summarily firing him in a fit of frustration.\n\nIn the wake of this unexpected display of passion, an idea began to form in [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s mind. This setback, this humiliation, could be the catalyst for something greater - a rallying cry to propel Ukraine into a new era of progress and prosperity. He dubbed this new initiative 'Catch and Exceed', determined not only to match the achievements of their rivals but to surpass them in every way.\nWord of the 'shoe-banging incident' quickly spread throughout the country, becoming a humorous anecdote shared between friends and colleagues. But beneath the laughter, the newfound determination inspired by 'Catch and Exceed' took root.\n\nWhether [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s dramatic outburst and his latest policy will indeed reshape the nation, or simply serve as comic relief in an ever-stranger chapter of history, remains to be seen. For now, however, the people of Ukraine prepare themselves to strive to 'work, live, and create according to the laws of beauty' - and for the sound of further shoe-banging."

Slogans have begun to appear everywhere - from billboards to the sides of factories.\n\nThe Party, of course, would not settle for simple slogans to stir the nation. They have organized a myriad of hilarious activities and contests to encourage participation in the ambitious program. Potato sack races have become an overnight sensation, as citizens compete to determine which district can catch and exceed their neighbors' potato-harvesting prowess. Train conductors are holding impromptu stop-watch competitions to prove who can really drive the express train to industrial success. Even laundry-washing battles have taken on new significance, as women across the nation strive to outwit their counterparts in neighboring countries with their superior laundry-beating skills.\n\n'Catch and Exceed' can truly revolutionize the nation, as for the moment, the citizens of Ukraine are more united than ever, proudly displaying their polished shoes and standing behind their leader in his passionate quest for progress."

ukrsoc.366.t: "Hi-Bred Corn and American Agrarian Allies"
ukrsoc.366.d: "Deepening our connections with the Americans, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] has kept close contact with Iowa-born Progressive Leftist, academic, and corn biologist Henry Wallace, whose own expertise and business connections have led him to create his own corny empire in the American heartlands. Created in 1926 by Wallace, his brother James, and a group of investors from his home state of Iowa, the Hi-Bred Corn Company is aimed at the creation of the perfect corn seed culture, and thus the perfect corn crop. This noble goal is pursued through use of selective breeding, early genetic modification techniques, and the application of genetically modified pollinator species, like certain insects, as well as the creation of special pesticides/herbicides. By working with these American masters of corn, we shall further our own knowledge and deepen our mastery over corn, but that is not all we have gained from this cooperation. \n\nTaking these ideas, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName], Wallace, and their fellow corn-addicts across the globe have begun to work together to create an international regulatory bureau to oversee and manage the hybridization and genetic modification of corn worldwide, ensuring that all tampering with the noble corn plant - the lifeblood of our nation and the wider human species - is done so in a way fitting to our pure standards. However, a debate has arisen internally in this new bureau - nicknamed Pioneer Hi-Bred International by the Wallace brothers - as to the scope of our watchdog and management efforts. Henry Wallace and his company have been known to tamper not only with corn, but with other foodstuffs - particularly chickens - in order to create healthier, larger, and more efficient consumables for the world, and from this variety arises the debate. Many loyal to Khrushev declare that the bureau should only focus on corn so that our attention and expertise are not sullied or divided, and so that we can focus on our true obsession without deviation or increased risk of error, while others believe we should not ‘put all our ears of corn in one basket’, as it were and instead pursue a more varied nutritional foundation. Though we shall continue to work with our partners for the betterment of the hungry masses, we need to decide on a scope for this specific effort; should we only focus on the bioengineering of corn, or should we branch out?."

Recognizing the dire need for reform, and thought by many to be an ineffective, uninspired choice for the role of premier, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] delivers a stunning blow to doubters with the introduction of Sovnarkhoz – a decentralization policy designed to breathe life into the stagnant industries and tattered agricultural sectors that languish beneath the weight of a faltering socialist dream.\nCritics hold their breath as Sovnarkhoz takes root in Ukraine. This transformative policy sees the creation of regional economic councils, stepping away from the strict centralization that has long been a hallmark of the prevailing government authority. These councils are granted independent control, allowing them to quickly and decisively adapt local policies to the unique and varied challenges faced by communities throughout Ukraine.\n\nWhile the introduction of Sovnarkhoz is far from a panacea, the policy nonetheless introduces a breath of potential fresh air into a nation gasping for change. The Ukrainian people, long ignored and hard-pressed under the ironclad rule of Yevhenia Bosh, find themselves cautiously daring to hope that maybe – just maybe – their struggles and sorrows may finally give way to a better life, with the unlikeliest of leaders at the helm.\nIn this critical juncture, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s introduction of Sovnarkhoz represents a glimmer of sunlight on the horizon, piercing through the lingering clouds of oppression and despair that cloak the land. It is far too early to say whether this policy will yield lasting change or merely make an ephemeral dent in the nation's plight – but in the hearts and minds of the Ukrainian people, the winds of change are stirring once again."

Lysenko argues that traits acquired through environmental adaptation can be passed down to future generations. His ideas are a sharp departure from conventional scientific thought on genetics and inheritance, igniting eager whispers of a revolution in agriculture.\n\nIntrigued by the possibilities, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] leans in, listening intently to Lysenko's impassioned explanations of his theories. The audience watches in fascination as Lysenko passionately demonstrates how his Michurin Agrobiology Theory could improve crop yields and revolutionize the Ukrainian agricultural sector.\nThe room buzzes with excitement as Lysenko finishes his presentation, with a sense of hope and possibility in the air.

In his passionate drive to spearhead a new approach, Lysenko implements his agricultural theories across the nation's corn crop – with disastrous repercussions.\n\nAs the corn yield slowly begins to dwindle, the true impact of Lysenko's policies becomes heartbreakingly evident. The crop erosion of corn, resulting from his uninformed decisions, threatens to plunge the country's already struggling food supply into further disarray.\nThe devastating effects caused by Lysenko’s approach ripple throughout Ukraine, shaking the very foundations of its already fragile agricultural sector. Confidence in [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]’s new era of change begins to wane, as citizens express their growing concern for their nation's ability to tackle the mounting food crisis. As public opinion swiftly turns against Lysenko, his political standing becomes increasingly tenuous. Questions are raised over his fitness to remain as Minister of Agriculture, putting tremendous pressure on [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s government to address the unfolding catastrophe. Facing the grim reality of the situation, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] and his administration are left to grapple with the consequences of their bold decisions.

Frightened to point out the Vozhd's mistake, they decided that in this way Nikita Sergeyevich expressed his opinion about renaming the party, and that it was better not to anger him without cause, but simply to officially record that the party now bears the name of its great leader.\n\nThe shuddering situation has already generated a lot of jokes and really made our citizens' day!"

ukrsoc.376.t: "'Arsenal'"
ukrsoc.376.d: "On January 29, 1918, the workers of the factory 'Arsenal' in Kyiv organised an armed pro-Bolshevik mutiny known as a January Rebellion against the Central Rada, the Ukrainian assembly that declared the independence of Ukraine during the Russian Civil War. Since then, the government has failed to interfere with the poor administration of the factory, fearing their actions accidentally sparking a worker’s revolt in Kyiv. After the triumph of Bolshevism in Ukraine however, the government has decided to revive of the factory. 'Arsenal' will mainly produce artillery, anti-tank, and anti-aircraft guns, all of which our nation, surrounded by forces hostile to our revolutionary ideology, desperately need."
ukrsoc.376.a: "God bless [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]!"

ukrsoc.377.t: "'Obolon'"
ukrsoc.377.d: "[ROOT.GetLeader] knows that the workers and peasants of Ukraine deserve a chance for a happier, better life, which is why he always pays serious attention to the needs of the ordinary people. The Government has proposed an excellent idea that aligns with his thinking. [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] offered to invest in the largest nationalised brewing facility in Europe, allowing us to greatly expand it and lower the price of cheap alcohol. The expansion of the factory, named 'Obolon', will definitely give us increased support among the low and middle classes of the Ukrainian society. After all, who doesn't like alcohol?"
ukrsoc.377.a: "An astute proposal!"

ukrsoc.378.t: "[GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s Semiletka Plan Spurs Urbanisation"
ukrsoc.378.t2: "Russification Struggles amid Rapid Urbanisation"
ukrsoc.378.d: "With the rapid urbanisation of Ukrainian cities, [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s ambitious Semiletka plan is unveiled, aiming to accelerate the development of agriculture and transform Ukraine into an industrial powerhouse. Drawing inspiration from the ongoing urbanisation of Kyiv, Kharkiv and Odesa this five-year plan is set to modernise the nation and further stimulate economic growth. As part of the plan, the government heavily invests in building new infrastructure to provide better housing, transportation, and education facilities for the growing urban population.\n\nIn the context of cultural awakening, through the establishment of cultural institutions, new schools, and publishing houses, the government centres the Ukrainian language and history within the framework of the Ukraine as part of Greater Russia. The fusion of modern and local architectural styles is encouraged, as well as the preservation of traditional customs and practices in the urban centres.\n\nDespite the challenges of unsystematic growth and the ever-present tensions between Bolshevist policies and national aspirations, the Semiletka plan proves to be a powerful catalyst for both urbanisation and the revival of Ukraine's cultural heritage."
ukrsoc.378.d2: "As the urban centres in the [UKR.GetName] continue to expand under [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]'s Semiletka plan, tensions arise between the Ukrainians and Russians. [RUS.Capital.GetName] pushes for the further integration of [UKR.GetNameDef] into the [RUS.GetAdjective] domain, seeking to assert greater control over the nation and its growing cities. The ongoing urbanisation proves to be a fertile ground for the cross-pollination of cultural ideas, resulting in the growth of pro-Russian sentiment in urban areas such as Kyiv and Odesa.\n\nHowever, this attempt to impose Russification on the Ukrainian population encounters strong resistance from the population with urban centres like Kharkiv becoming the primary battlegrounds for this struggle.\n\nWith urbanisation becoming an increasingly important element of Ukrainian society, the Semiletka plan serves as both the fuel for Russification attempts and the conduit for cultural resistance. Ukraine, caught in this tug-of-war between national pride and [RUS.GetAdjective] influence, must navigate the complexities of rapid urbanisation in a world marked by ideological divides."
ukrsoc.378.a: "A modern country we're building."

ukrsoc.379.t: "The Red Hetman of Revolutionary Ukraine"
ukrsoc.379.d: "Since the birth of the current Ukrainian state, the Ukranian people have been subjected to ridicule. Mass poverty amongst the working class, ruled by an Austrian puppet king whilst subservient to the German Empire. It appeared to many that the future of this nation was hopeless, that changed with one man. Comrade [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] has taken the mantle of leadership, proving himself to be a modern equivalent to the legendary Hetmans. [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] has firmly booted foreign imperialistic influences whilst pulling the poor out of plight, providing a new hope for all Ukrainians!"
ukrsoc.379.a: "Long live Comrade [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]!"

ukrsoc.384.t: "The New Ukraine"
ukrsoc.384.d: "Once defined by its peasantry dominated agricultural society, Ukraine was always a battle-ground between Russian and European influence and control. Previously lacking a respectable government that put the Ukrainian people first, the tryrannical German bootlicking monarchy is no more. The old backwards Ukraine is no more. Thanks to Comrade [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] the Ukranian state is rapidly industrialising and modernising. Although set back by Kulak resistance and mismanagement of collective farming, the nation has rebounded with a centralised economic plan based upon the ever growing factories that now dominate the farmland. The future of Ukraine is now!"
ukrsoc.384.a: "Without Comrade [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] there would be no new Ukraine!"

ukrsoc.385.t: "The Rise of the Corn Front"
ukrsoc.385.d: "Emulating similar pioneers and scouts groups created by revolutionary groups in France, Czechia, Russia, England, Italy, America, and many other nations, Chairman [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName] has created what he calls the ‘Corn Front’ - a youth-orientated scouts organization form-fit for Ukraine. By plowing fields, sowing seeds, picking corn, hiking through Ukraine’s natural wonders and beauteous landscapes while learning survivalist and naturalist training, and other various revolutionary disciplines in order to ensure that future generations become passively indoctrinated to our specific ideas as they learn to always be on guard and on cornwatch. The future of our Leftist and corn-based agrarian ways must be protected and future loyal prosperity be assured, and as such, this program shall mobilize the youthful masses of [GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]’s Ukraine and put them to work in our corn-based agriculture process so that they may embrace the ideals of labor and the revolution through firsthand experience. Only then will the next generation of the Revolution be secured."

### Economy Events ###

ukreco.1.t: "Black Monday Hits Ukraine!"
ukreco.1.d: "Almost two weeks ago the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into the abyss, throwing Germany’s economy into an unprecedented crisis. Now that the crash’s shock waves have reached the Ukraine, German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ukrainian Hrivna is losing value, and resource exports are shrinking exponentially."
ukreco.1.a: "Let us hope that Europe remains open to us."

ukreco.2.t: "Agricultural Crisis!"
ukreco.2.d: "Since the Weltkrieg, Ukraine has traditionally relied upon its valuable grain trade with the German Empire in order to maintain its economic security. Unfortunately the current socio-economic issues afflicting the Reich have meant that it is now far more interested in protecting its own farmers than taking the politically unpopular move of subsidising Ukrainian agriculture. This could be very dangerous for us as without support from the German market, our ruling class of agrarian landowners could find it difficult to maintain their dominance in the countryside."
ukreco.2.a: "We’re still the breadbasket of Europe, right?"

ukreco.3.t: "Germany Averts Agricultural Crisis!"
ukreco.3.d: "Despite the enormous financial difficulties that fell on the shoulders of the Kaiser government, they decided not to raise tariffs on imports, and as a result they were able to avoid an agricultural crisis in our country"
ukreco.3.a: "Seems like Germany is a trustworthy ally."

ukreco.4.t: "Landowner Petitions the Government"
ukreco.4.d: "Taking note of our plans to distribute land fairly to the peasants, a large landowner in [201.GetName] has petitioned the local government offering us political support if we avoid tampering with his land. Though landlords are some of the most powerful people in Ukraine and their support would certainly be of use, going back on our promises of land reform may radicalise the peasants and bring hosts of other problems."
ukreco.4.a: "Of course, we can make exceptions."
ukreco.4.b: "We will not play favourites here."

ukreco.5.t: "The Marshes of [997.GetName]"
ukreco.5.d: "In the marshier parts of Ukrainian [997.GetName], large landowners dominate as the land is seen as too economically unviable to develop, leading to a great deal of unused land. Though it may be costly, attempting to drain the wetlands of the marshes in order to turn the estates more profitable and giving it to the smaller peasantry may work out for us in the long term."
ukreco.5.a: "This is too costly."
ukreco.5.b: "We shall transform the marshes!"

ukreco.8.t: "Subsidies for Veterans?"
ukreco.8.d: "In carrying out our land reform programme the government has been particularly interested to select the beneficiaries of the reform. In exchange for their valuable political loyalty, one idea that has been floated around is to prioritise veterans and families of those who have been killed in war."
ukreco.8.a: "It would be valuable..."
ukreco.8.b: "There is no need."

ukreco.9.t: "Fate of the German Landowners"
ukreco.9.d: "With the recent disbanding of the Ukrainian Freikorps, the government now faces the complex issue of dealing with the German landowners who had settled in the country as a result of their Freikorps service. Promised land in exchange for their military aid, these foreigners have now effectively become a new social class in Ukraine.\nDebates surrounding the future of these German landowners have been heated, with several factions advocating for different solutions. The government must strike a balance between maintaining good relations with Germany, ensuring domestic stability, and upholding the rights of the native Ukrainian population.\n\nOne proposed course of action is to buy out the lands owned by the German settlers, thus peacefully ending the perceived \"German colonialism\" in Ukraine. By offering a fair price for their lands, the government hopes to encourage the Germans to return to their homeland while still maintaining good relations between the two nations. This option, however, may place a considerable financial burden on the Ukrainian Treasury.\n\nA more radical faction within the government argues for the outright confiscation of German-owned lands without payment. This approach would send a strong message against foreign influence and demonstrate the Ukrainian government's commitment to their native citizens. However, such a brash decision could severely worsen relations with Germany and provoke potential retaliation.\n\nLastly, the government could opt to leave the current arrangements in place, allowing German landowners to retain their properties in the country. By keeping the status quo, the government would prioritize the existing relationship with Germany and avoid conflict in the short-term. Critics argue that this option may perpetuate tensions between the native Ukrainian population and the German settlers.\n\nWith each option presenting its own set of challenges and compromises, the Ukrainian government must weigh the long-term impact of their decision carefully. Ultimately, the fate of the German landowners and their place within Ukrainian society hangs in the balance."
ukreco.9.d2: "As the Freikorps forces become assimilated into the Ukrainian Army, a new question arises regarding the fate of the German landowners, who gained their properties due to their previous service in the Freikorps. Strong opinions from various factions within the [GetUkrainianParliamentName] have surfaced, debating whether the lands should be bought out, confiscated, or left under the control of the German landowners.\n\nAdvocates of nationalization argue that a peaceful purchase of the lands would help dispel sentiments of foreign occupation and end the so-called \"German colonialism\". This option would require significant financial resources from the Ukrainian government, possibly leading to long-term economic effects, but it aims to promote domestic stability in the region and reduce potential tensions between the Ukrainian and German populations.\n\nProponents of a more radical measure insist that immediate confiscation of the German-owned lands will eliminate any sense of foreign dominance in the region, directly addressing concerns about political sovereignty. This option, however, is likely to provoke diplomatic tensions with Germany, as well as hostility from the integrated Freikorps soldiers who may be alienated by such an action.\n\nSupporters of maintaining the status quo believe that redistributing the lands would only create unnecessary friction between the newly integrated soldiers and their now-fellow Ukrainians – potentially undermining the benefits of assimilating the Freikorps. They argue that leaving the lands under German ownership would demonstrate goodwill towards the former Freikorps members and foster a sense of trust, even at the risk of accusations of foreign dominance.\n\nWith these various options laid out before them, the Ukrainian government must choose a path that will determine the future relationship between the state, the German landowners, and the recently integrated Freikorps soldiers still loyal to their German comrades. The decision could have far-reaching consequences on the domestic stability of the nation and its international relations. The fate of the German landowners in Ukraine remains uncertain."
ukreco.9.a: "Buy their farms, end German colonialism!"
ukreco.9.b: "Leave the lands in German hands"
ukreco.9.c: "Confiscate the lands without compensation!"

ukreco.11.t: "Landowner Petitions the Government"
ukreco.11.d: "Taking note of our plans to distribute land fairly to the peasants, a large landowner in Kherson has petitioned the local government offering us political support if we avoid tampering with his land. Though landlords are some of the most powerful people in Ukraine and their support would certainly be of use, going back on our promises of land reform may radicalise the peasants and bring hosts of other problems."
ukreco.11.a: "No way."
ukreco.11.b: "Perhaps we can seek a compromise?"
ukreco.11.c: "We could make exceptions."

ukreco.12.t: "Uneven Ownership in the West"
ukreco.12.d: "Historically, in western Ukraine, the landowning elites have mostly been of Polish descent, whereas the peasantry have mostly been Ukrainian. The clear divide in land ownership among ethnic lines has been a cause of concern for many peasants and our government. Perhaps we should direct some of our efforts to clearing up this divide."
ukreco.12.a: "Of course."
ukreco.12.b: "We do not want to alienate the Poles."

ukreco.14.t: "Question of Taxation"
ukreco.14.d: "Some in our government have argued for higher taxation of big landowners, arguing that it would grant the government the ability to help fund welfare programmes and support small farms, although this has been cautioned against with others arguing that this will only lead to a drop in agricultural productivity."
ukreco.14.a: "It would surely win us the support of the peasants."
ukreco.14.b: "This isn't what we need."

ukreco.15.t: "Encouraging New Exports"
ukreco.15.d: "For many years, Ukraine has been recognised as a major exporter of sunflower seeds and wheat, providing these staples to nations across the globe. However, as the nation's ambitious land reform programme unfolds, there have been increasing calls for the diversification of our exports. This can be accomplished by empowering peasants with new plots of land and promoting the growth of new crops. While this may prove to be a costly endeavour, the potential rewards for expanding our export portfolio are substantial."
ukreco.15.a: "Stick to our traditional crops."
ukreco.15.b: "It will be worth it in the long term."

ukreco.16.t: "Cheating the System"
ukreco.16.d: "Some landowners have found a way to circumvent our reform efforts by selling their excess land to friends and family, who in turn rent the land back at nominal cost. This kind of arrangements are hard to stop, as technically no crime is being committed, except against good faith."
ukreco.16.a: "Damn."

ukreco.17.t: "Tractors, Tractors, Tractors"
ukreco.17.d: "Thanks to caps to land rents, more and more farmers have been able to afford more modern farming equipment - chiefly among them tractors. A single tractor can halve the amount of work needed to produce the same amount of grain, which in practice means that the same amount of workers can produce twice as many crops. Welcome to modern times!"
ukreco.17.a: "Tax those production increases more."
ukreco.17.b: "Let them sell them."

ukreco.18.t: "Volynian Poles Petition Government"
ukreco.18.d: "Nobility descending from Poles form a significant part of the elites in the western parts of Ukraine, having amassed great estates during imperial times. These landowners have been generally supportive of the Hetman's policies in the past, but recent land redistribution policies have made them wary. They have argued for exceptions based on various local laws and traditions, and are essentially promising their continuing support for the regime in exchange of \"loopholes.\""
ukreco.18.a: "Surely traditions must be respected."
ukreco.18.b: "They need to obey the laws, like everyone else."

ukreco.19.t: "Speculation With Subsidies"
ukreco.19.d: "After opening easy credit for small landowners for buying agricultural equipment, some more well-off farmers have taken the chance to use these loans to invest in profitable industries. Technically this is abusing the loan policy and taking funds from people who actually need them, but it is also rather beneficial for our domestic industry."
ukreco.19.a: "They are an example to all farmers."
ukreco.19.b: "Ensure such things won't happen again."

ukreco.20.t: "Distillery Boom"
ukreco.20.d: "We have been giving subsidies for any factory projects in rural regions to help those areas grow and modernise. It seems that most popular business there has quickly became distilleries, especially ones mostly producing cheap horilka out of excess grain. There has been critique from many concerned people - priests, mothers, teachers - that these \"devil's machines\" spew indecent lifestyle to the countryside with cheap alcohol. However, they are very productive, and restricting them would mean losing quite bit of potential growth and corporate taxes."
ukreco.20.a: "Alcohol is the devil's drink."
ukreco.20.b: "Cheers!"

ukreco.21.t: "Draining the Marshes"
ukreco.21.d: "There are many marshes and wetlands especially in northwestern Ukraine, where the great Pinsk Marshes continue for hundreds of miles. Draining parts of these swamps would create more farmland, but it is also very expensive, as many canals need to be dug to drain the water. Normally these projects are organised by purpose-founded \"swamp cooperatives\", where each member pays part of the draining expenses, and gets new farmland in the proportion to their contribution. With state subsidies, we could greatly help such farmland reclamation."
ukreco.21.a: "Swamps will not stand in the way of progress!"
ukreco.21.b: "Sounds expensive."

ukreco.22.t: "Estates of the Orthodox Church"
ukreco.22.d: "Many churches and monasteries own sizeable land estates, and have rent farmers tending to their lands. Under our land redistribution policies, the wealthiest of monasteries should also sell part of their land. However, many of them have petitioned for special treatment, arguing that they are not corporations or individuals with profit motive, but seeking the greater good of the whole Ukrainian people. It is true that the church estates are often more modern and well-tended than the ones owned by aristocrats, but then again making exceptions is not desirable either."
ukreco.22.a: "The Church is always right!"
ukreco.22.b: "Did Christ own land?"

ukreco.25.t: "[ROOT.GetLeader] Announces Completion of Land Reform"
ukreco.25.d: "Today, the government, headed by the Minister of Agriculture, reported on the completion of land reform. The measures taken were aimed at creating a sustainable land policy and satisfying the interests of the peasantry. But the results of this reform may not seem satisfactory to everyone."
ukreco.25.a: "Finally?"

ukreco.30.t: "The Kerch Bridge"
ukreco.30.d.intro: "The first person who seriously thought about building a bridge across the Kerch strait was naval officer and engineer V.D. Mendeleev, the son of the creator of the periodic table of chemical elements D.I. Mendeleev. His work \"Project of raising the level of the Sea of Azov by damming the Kerch Strait\" was published in 1899, after the death of the author.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century in the Russian Empire were working on projects for the construction of a railway bridge across the Kerch Strait. Two possible routes were proposed: the northern one, between the Kerch Peninsula and the Chushka Spit, and the southern one, passing through the Tuzla Spit. With the permission of Nicholas II in 1910, the planning of the southern route began, but the outbreak of the Weltkrieg prevented the creation of a railroad across the strait."
ukreco.30.d.ukr: "$ukreco.30.d.intro$\nNow the government has finally outlined the project and is ready to start the construction. With the new agreements between Kuban and Ukraine the chance to 'reunite' our two countries by land is finally highly likely!"
ukreco.30.d.kub: "$ukreco.30.d.intro$\n\nOur partners in Ukraine have initiated a massive project to build a railway bridge between the Crimean peninsula and Kuban. The Ukrainian government has officially initiated the project, and if everythings goes alright, we will finally connect to Ukraine by land."
ukreco.30.a: "Great!"

ukreco.31.t: "The Kerch Bridge Construction Is Finished!"
ukreco.31.d: "The great construction of the Kerch Bridge is finally finished! For almost a year the workers of both Kuban and Ukraine were busy working hard for the good of their countries, but now thanks to them the first train has already passed over the new railroad bridge. The opening of the bridge was attended by the head of our government, as well as several other high-ranking officials from both Kuban and Ukraine."
ukreco.31.a: "Can we say now Kuban is truly reunited with Motherland!"

ukreco.32.t: "Industrialisation Plans"
ukreco.32.d: "As the state finally recovers from Black Monday and the fallout of the revolt gradually diminishes, we can now begin our great industrialisation projects. The industrialisation projects fizzled out, in realisation that, although it is necessary, it was not as pressing of an issue - nor would it get the Hetman's party any votes. Nonetheless, the revolt has taught us that if the [UKR.GetName] is to survive, we must learn from our mistakes and improvise greatly. The real work begins now."
ukreco.32.a: "Let us begin!"

ukreco.40.t: "Suspension of Dnieper Hydroelectric Station Construction"
ukreco.40.d: "Because of the withdrawal of German investors and the emptying of the treasury, we cannot complete the construction of the Dnieper hydropower plant on time. Workers are on strike and demand timely payment of wages."
ukreco.40.a: "We’ll finish it later."

ukreco.42.t: "Ukrainian Government Terminates Brotfrieden!"
ukreco.42.d: "The Ukrainian government has undertaken a new foreign economic doctrine aimed at protecting their sovereignty and interests. As part of this doctrine, practically the first decision of their government was the abolition of the "Bread Peace" which had been in effect since 1918 and which effectively guaranteed the independence of the Ukrainian state from the Central Powers. Thanks to the Bread Peace, tens of thousands of German and Austro-Hungarian soldiers received foodstuffs that were critically lacking. The tariffs had been in effect for nearly 20 years, but now the Breadbasket of Europe had decided to manage its own resources and set prices on the market. Such a drastic change in the volume and quantity of supplies could not but affect the supply of our army and even the civilian population, and we must take decisive measures in response."
ukreco.42.a: "Demand restoration of the treaty!"
ukreco.42.b: "We must seek another source of food."
ukreco.42.c: "Ukraine must be punished! Introduce wide-scale embargo!"

ukreco.43.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Restoration of Brotfrieden!"
ukreco.43.d: "Outraged by our drastic measures, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government demanded the immediate resumption of the status quo and the Bread Peace Treaty, which once again proves [FROM.GetName]'s intention to get everything from Ukraine for next to nothing."
ukreco.43.a: "Funny [FROM.GetAdjective]s! Treaty is Dead!"
ukreco.43.b: "Demand security guarantees and negotiate better terms."

ukreco.44.t: "[FROM.GetName] Embargoes Us!"
ukreco.44.d: "Outraged by our drastic measures, the [FROM.GetAdjective] government imposed an extensive embargo on us. Without [FROM.GetAdjective] goods and armaments, we may have a hard time, but this is the price for freedom and independence."
ukreco.44.a: "We don't need their goods!"

ukreco.45.t: "Brotfrieden Is Declared Dead!"
ukreco.45.d: "Ukraine officially rejected our demands and declared that the Bread Peace was no longer in effect. This impudence of the Ukrainian government has shocked us and now we must respond."
ukreco.45.a: "Enforce the bread and food supplies!"
ukreco.45.b: "Embargo Ukraine!"

ukreco.46.t: "[FROM.GetName] Demands Security Guarantees!"
ukreco.46.d: "Ukraine has said it is ready to negotiate on food supplies, but in response they demand guarantees of their independence. What should we do?"
ukreco.46.a: "Accept their demands."
ukreco.46.b: "There's no point. Enforce our terms!"
ukreco.46.c: "Refuse the demands and embargo Ukraine!"

ukreco.47.t: "Ukrainian Policies Provoke Food Shortage"
ukreco.47.d: "The new foreign economic doctrine to suspend preferential food supplies has severely hit our allies, including us. Our market was unprepared for the sharp rise in food prices and led to food shortages. Economists predict that the shortage will last at least a year until the market fully recovers and adapts to the new prices."
ukreco.47.a: "Hope we will recover soon."

ukreco.48.t: "[FROM.GetName] Agrees!"
ukreco.48.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government agreed to our terms. This is a great victory for Ukrainian diplomacy, because in addition to the increase in prices for our products, although preserving certain benefits for [FROM.GetName], we were able to get a guarantee of our independence and a non-aggression treaty with them."
ukreco.48.a: "Glory to Ukraine!"

ukreco.49.t: "Mitteleuropa Encounters Bread Crisis!"
ukreco.49.d: "Because of Ukraine's new foreign economic policy, the government took steps to break up the so-called \"Bread Peace\", which largely predetermined the Central Powers' victory in the Weltkrieg by supplying German and Austro-Hungarian soldiers with Ukrainian grain and food at reduced prices.\n\nGermany's colonial policy toward Ukraine has caused a series of political and economic crises, but now the Ukrainian government is finally strong enough to tell its former masters that the \"Breadbasket of Europe\" will now determine to whom and for how much its products are delivered. The countries of Mitteleuropa and the Austrian sphere have already faced the first consequences in the form of food shortages to supply their armies."

ukrmisc.1.t: "Monument to the Zaporizhian Cossacks"
ukrmisc.1.d: "Hetmanate is a period of our history, inextricably linked with the Zaporizhian Cossacks. And although this period was difficult and ambiguous, it is with the Cossacks that we associate the history of the statehood of the Ukrainian state. Today, a monument to the Zaporizhian Cossacks was opened near Cherkassy. The opening was attended by Hetman Skoropadskyi himself, who made a speech and spoke about the importance of historical memory. Among the audience was also the headman of the Kyiv Governorate, Pavlo Adrianov, who also made a speech. \n\nThis is not the first monument to the Hetmanate opened in the last 15 years. Ukrainization is in full swing and we can only hope that soon our people will find their true national consciousness."

ukrmisc.2.t: "Sviato Kupala Holiday"
ukrmisc.2.d: "Today, Sviato Kupala Day is celebrated in Ukraine. For a long time, the former unofficial national Christian holiday, now July 7 is officially considered a day off.\n\nThe night of Ivan Kupala is filled with rituals related to water, fire and herbs. The main part of Kupala rituals is performed at night. It is considered mandatory for the holiday to swim before sunset. Closer to sunset, bonfires are lit on the hills or by the rivers. On the night of Ivan Kupala, the "betrothed" are chosen and marriage rites are performed: jumping over the fire, holding hands, exchanging wreaths, searching for a fern flower and bathing in the morning dew.\n\nDespite the fact that official events with the participation of high-ranking officials are not held, ordinary Ukrainian people in villages celebrate this ancient holiday with pleasure."
ukrmisc.2.a: "Zelene Kupalo z lita upalo"

ukrmisc.3.t: "'Ivan Ilyich'"
ukrmisc.3.d: "A new play by Mikhail Bulgakov, \"Ivan Ilyich\", appeared today on the posters. The plot is based on castling in time, when due to a malfunction of the machine invented by engineer Tymofeenko, the Kyiv housekeeper Koretskyi, together with the crook Zhorzh Myloslavskyi, move to the 18th century, and Hetman Ivan Skoropadskyi falls into the 20th century. Almost vaudeville confusion leads to the creation of numerous comic situations in which the characters, who find themselves in \"alien\" eras, live according to the laws of their time. \n\nIt turns out that Koretskyi is surprisingly similar to the Hetman, which is noticed by Myloslavskyi, who, posing as Prince Golytsyn, convinces Koretskyi to play the role of Hetman. Koretskyi, being an ardent supporter of modern politics, causes insurmountable horror among the Cossacks by publicly renouncing Peter the Great and his 'Muscovy' and declaring an alliance with the Teutons.\n\nAt the same time in 20th century Kyiv, Hetman Skoropadskyi at first rejoices to learn that his descendant rules the country, but then he is horrified to learn that the Austrian Archduke is sitting at the head of the country as a King, and German garrisons are walking around the city. \n\nThe play ends with everything falling back into place, and Tymofeenko wakes up. However, the ending remains open, giving viewers to wonder if all this really happened."
ukrmisc.3.a: "Will Bulgakov be forgiven for such satire?"

ukrmisc.5.t: "A Stunning Concert in Berlin"

Under the direction of conductor Oleksandr Gorilyi, the orchestra played the symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms and Schubert beautifully. Apparently, impressionable German viewers remember last year’s tour of the countries of Mittel Europe and Austria-Hungary, with sold-out tickets and full stalls and amphitheaters. This year the triumph was repeated.\n\nThe National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine will be a real creative laboratory of Ukrainian composers and conductors.

Famous in the early 30s as a talented aircraft designer, Koroliv was sent to Germany for an internship, from where he returned in 1932 with plans to build cruise missiles for the Armed Forces of the Ukrainian State. At the initiative of the Germans for the development of the defense capability of Ukraine, a group for the study of missile movement was created, in fact - the state scientific and design laboratory for the development of missile aircraft. To date, projects have already been developed for liquid cruise and long-range ballistic missiles, aircraft missiles for firing at air and ground targets and anti-aircraft solid-fuel missiles.\n\nAccording to the confessions of the youngest aircraft designer, he dreams of a human flight into space and believes that this is possible in the near future.

Already in the autumn of 1917, the gang of a Yaponchik made a number of daring raids, including robbing a Romanian gambling club during the day. On New Year’s Day in 1918, Goldstein’s store and the sugar factory owner Yu. Gepner were robbed. At the same time, Yaponchik organized the so-called Jewish Revolutionary Self-Defense Squad under the pretext of fighting possible pogroms and issued a \"proclamation\" calling for robbing \"only the bourgeoisie and officers.\" In November 1917, one of the robbers was even killed by the Yaponchik himself for robbing a worker.\nHe established contacts with the Odesa anarchist movement and in early December 1917, a group of so-called \"anarchist-rippers\" (\"rippers off the bourgeoisie\") appeared in Odesa, who staged a powerful explosion on Deribasovskaya Street in 1917, demanding an end to lynching of captured bandits. Later the bandits seized Eisenberg’s brothel on Dvoryanskaya Street, setting up their headquarters there.\nIn January 1918, Yaponchik’s squad, together with the Bolsheviks, anarchists and left SRS, participated in street battles. The bandits took advantage of these events to raid the Registration Bureau of the police, during which a card file for 16 thousand Odesa criminals was burned.\nAt the beginning of 1919, he actively collaborated with the Bolshevik underground. During the Civil War, the Yaponchik gang committed many new daring robberies, also engaged in kidnappings and racketeering. A number of entrepreneurs who did not want to pay the bandits were killed. In February 1919, a daring raid was made on a Civil public meeting of Odesa during a gala dinner, the apartment of Duchess Lyubomirskaya and the room of the Spanish consul at the Londonskyi Hotel were also robbed. Yaponchik invested the money earned from crime in real business: he bought the most luxurious restaurant in Odesa. A casino and a brothel functioned under him.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, this open banditry of Yaponchik ended and he lay low, successfully eluding the Derzhavna Varta. However, recently our valiant law enforcement officers managed to raid an underground casino, presumably owned by Yaponchik. Unfortunately, once again, he himself was not there."

It was there that some varieties of Crimean port, madeira, and sherry were produced. The high quality of the wine was achieved by blending different grape varieties. In 1837 , the quality of Masandra wines was highly appreciated by the Russian Emperor Nicholas I.\n\nToday Masandra is the oldest wine cellar in the region. The main basement, built in 1897, consists of seven tunnels. The length of each of them is 150 meters and the width is 5 meters. Tunnels fan out from the central gallery. They always maintain a constant air temperature of 10-12 ° C, that is, the best for aging wine.\n\nIn Masandra there are the oldest main wineries for long-term aging and processing of wines, the first wine of its own production was laid in 1898.\n\nAfter several years of relative desolation, the region is now developing again due to state subsidies for wine production and the development of health complexes in the Crimea.

It was the Yuzivka sports society that held the first international match in Donbas - in the autumn of 1924, the workers of the German national team were defeated 5-0. The Hetman government decided to develop sports in Ukraine, and a large amount of funds began to be poured into Yuzivka.\n\nToday, Yuzivka Sports Society is one of the leading football teams in the country.

In 1917 he also tried himself in cinematography - as an actor in 'Life and Death of Lieutenant Shmidt'.\nHe also created the Ukraine's first Jazz band with the finest musicians available in his home town of Odesa and created a style all his own - combining stand up comedy with a jazz show, blending several styles, ranging from Ukrainian and Jewish folk songs to a variety of cosmopolitan genres. The pressure on the socialists of Ukraine however impacted Utiosov's view of the Ukrainian government. In search for a better life he moved to Europe, where he attended performances of American jazz bands in Paris.\n\nWith the revolution succeeded in Ukraine, Utiosov returned to his native shore - already as a celebrity, bringing new culture and new types of shows to Odesa.

While initially a veteran organisation, much like the UVO, the Batkivschyna represents the moderate nationalist faction in the Armed Forces. United under Oleksandr Hrekiv's leadership, the organisation was established in 1918 as opposition to the Hetman's regime - which at the time was too Russophilic to attract national-democrats. Closely associated with the Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Independentists, or UPSS, the Batkivschyna movement has grown since then to become not only a patriotic organisation, but also a cooperative union and charity, with headquarters in Kyiv and such traditionally leftist regions as Melitopil and Bakhmut.\nDespite our government's unfaltering gaze of the Batkivschyna and great suspicion of its oppositional-minded officers, after all we can only be thankful to those who help the people in desperate times."

Proudly known as the first party to call for Independence, the dominant faction inside the UPSS was born from the Mikhnovskyi’s Ukrainian People's Party (UNP) and the UPSS's program took much inspiration from the works of the UNP.\n\nWhile at the times of its establishment the ideas of Independent Ukraine were seen as too radical, even the 1917 saw low popularity of the UPSS - the much more popular Socialist-Revolutionaries and Social-Democrats advocated for autonomy.\nThe UPSS soon enough became the largest national-democratic organisation, which most national-oriented officers started to join - with such personalities as Petro Bolbochan and Oleksandr Hrekiv. The latter one soon established \"Batkivschyna\" - a solely military society, though growing large enough to organize its own cooperative and charity. With the initial aim to overthrow Skoropadskyi, both UPSS and Batkivschyna have fallen out of graces with Hetman, and only due to the King Vasyl's intervention in 1927, the organisation were finally safe to operate legally.\n\nAiming to build a social-patriotic and civil-nationalist Ukraine, the party's still socialist to some degree, taking in account the country's large peasant and smallholder electorate."

As early as in 1900, Mikhnovskyi has written the program document 'Independent Ukraine', which became a manifesto of Ukrainian independence, despite not being the first to substantiate the idea of state independence and unity of Ukraine. Nevertheless, the impact of his writing was huge - Mikhnovskyi was accused of chauvinism and extreme radicalism. However, his call for terrorist attacks against the Russian Imperial Administration was met with extraordinary success and enthusiasm from young listeners. After all, Mikhnovskyi was really ahead of his time and his ideas were considered exotic for the Ukrainian intelligentsia, who proved to be not 'ready to fight for an independent Ukraine and use any means necessary until all foreign domination is eliminated', as outlined in his manifesto. In fact, it only made the situation worse for him. His ambitions and difficult character led to conflicts with leading Ukrainian figures and his relegation to the margins of the Ukrainian revolution - as a result, Mikhnovskyi became both admired for his legal expertise, leadership skills and oratorical talents, while at the same time criticized his chauvinism and arrogance.\n\nAll in all, he became an ostracized figure, perhaps, destined - as all his attempts to consolidate the Ukrainian nationalists have failed and all his 'battles' were lost. The aging visionary is now exiled in Kuban, teaching at the university.

ukrmisc.23.d1: "The Hetman has called for national unity, and for every Ukrainian to lay down their political disagreements as the entire nation is needed to fight the invaders. But these widely-broadcasted calls have not received the universal approval it was hoped they would. Russian propaganda - \"Free Ukraine in Free Russia\" - has been distributed widely especially in the eastern parts of the country.\n\nEven the greatest Ukrainian patriot has to face the question - is it better to serve the increasingly more authoritarian Hetman and his corrupt regime, which has zero respect for democracy... or perhaps to listen what the Russian Republic is offering, as genuine, free democracy? How paradoxical is it that the invader might bring more freedom to Ukraine? However, older people remember well the Tsarist times, and have little faith in Russian democracy. The spectre of Russification and the secret police looms over the promises made by [RUS.GetLeader]. Still, the majority of Ukrainians are supportive of the war - if not for their love of the Hetman, but for their love for their country." #Hetman dictatorship Ukraine vs democratic republican Russia
ukrmisc.23.d2: "There were great hopes that a democratic Russia would be less hell-bent on imperialist conquests than their Tsarist or Bolshevik predecessors, but that hope has been crushed with the invasion. All our attempts to foster peaceful cooperation between Russian and Ukrainian peoples were in vain. Some point fingers at the URDP and other liberals for having naive hopes of peaceful co-existence. Some blame the socialists, while others see the cause in Germany's imperialistic policy. But despite this disappointment, most of the country agrees on one thing: the invasion must be stopped, if the Ukrainian republic is to survive. It is a tragedy that close neighbours should wage war and slay millions, but such is the nature of history." #democratic Ukraine vs democratic, nonmonarchist Russia
ukrmisc.23.d3: "Already in 1917 the Hetman saved Ukraine from Bolshevik oppression. History repeats itself, as once again the Russian Red Army has invaded our dear country, and is threatening to take everything from us. The bombastic, anti-socialist rhetoric has won over much of the country, and even many liberals admit that rallying behind the Hetman is the wiser course of action. The socialists, already forced to the underground, have been targeted by mass arrests for treason and \"cooperating with the enemy\" - which is in many cases true.\n\nAfter the failed rebellion, what's left of the republicans has drifted hard to the left, and are now collaborating with the Ukrainian National Rada in Paris, actively opposing the war and supporting the Russian forces where they can, \"in the name of Free Ukraine.\" But true Ukrainians know these words false, and would rather support the Hetman, the only man with truly interest of Ukraine in his heart." #Hetman dictatorship Ukraine vs socialist Russia
ukrmisc.23.d4: "The Russian invasion has been hovering over our country like a spectre ever since we achieved our independence, but most people didn't believe it would ever become reality. Surely Russia could not challenge the German supremacy of Europe? Surely they would understand that cooperation benefits us both?\n\nBut no. The Russians clearly intend to swallow our hard-won independence. Whatever were greatly divisive topics in Ukraine before, it all seems irrelevant now. People have rallied behind [ROOT.GetLeader]'s defiant assurances of resistance, and even the Russophone community seems hesitant to support the Russian invasion, save for some small groups. Despite protests by the fringe, the vast majority of people have resigned to accept the reality: Ukraine needs to fight, if it is to decide its own future." #fallback

The revolution in the Priazv region came later than in other Ukrainian lands, so it was not very actively supported. This is due to ethnic and social peculiarities of the population of the region, the proximity of the Ukrainian-Russian border and the lack of authoritative representatives of Ukrainian political forces. \nAt the end of October 1917, the Central Rada recognized for the peoples who inhabited the Ukrainian lands \"a national-personal autonomy to ensure their rights and freedom of self-government in matters of their national life\".\nHowever, at the same time, the Central Rada abolished land ownership. Most of the Greek peasants had a lot of land in their estates, so this approach did not satisfy them. This further undermined the already low authority of the Ukrainian local authorities. The leading role in the creation of the Mariupil Union of Hellenes was played by the Greek commercial bourgeoisie, the liberal circles of the Greek intelligentsia, and the well-off Greek peasants. On November 10, 1917 a meeting of representatives of the volost Greek communities was held in Mariupil, which began the establishment of the Mariupil Union of the Hellenes. It was headed by a respected Hellenic leader Illia Pichakhchy. According to its organizers, the association of Mariupil Greeks had to protect the national interests of the Hellenic community in the difficult circumstances. However. the history of the Mariupil Union of Hellenes ended there - soon the congress was dispersed by German troops.\nNow, when words about administrative reform are heard again from the rostrum of the new Rada, Pichakhchy announced the reconstitution of the Mariupil Union of Hellenes and demanded that the government give the Greeks autonomy."

A new age dawned in these lands following the chaos of the German Intervention, and for years since, these fields have only languished and grown fallow as the new overlords of our once-proud Ukraine - the vile Austrians and Prussians - mishandle the state time and time again. \n\nUkraine weeps, and Mother Anarchy cries for her lost sons as once again the Germanics have proven their inability to run our land and rule our people. With the fallout of Black Monday and the following agricultural crisis caused by Germany’s blind and reckless economic strategies, Ukraine has once again plummeted into chaos. The people have been pushed to the brink, and are once again at each other’s throats as the economy comes crashing down upon our heads, all thanks to Hetman Skoropadskyi kowtowing to the so-called ‘Hegemon’. Even more frustrating, in this time of extreme circumstances, those still loyal to our new overlords have only benefitted while the rest of Ukraine - our Ukraine - has fallen to the dogs. The lowly peasant who tills his mucky soil has only fallen on harder times while his neighbor - an estate farmer down the road loyal to the German-backed Hetmanate - has only prospered, building himself a prosperous and gorgeous farm despite the raging inferno of economic decay that oppresses the true common man of Ukraine. Incidents like these have only caused more resentment to bubble and fester within the working-class masses of our Ukraine, and the hills and swamps of our homeland have once again begun to whisper of better times and more egalitarian, familiar ideas. Though our Bat’ko may be in exile hundreds of miles away to the West, the teachings and ideas of our beloved Father have only begun to grow more popular with each passing day in this ever-worsening maelstrom.

That is when the ways of Galicia and Volhynia diverged: the first went to Poland, and the latter to Lithuania.\nWith its incorporation into Muscovy, Volyn, like Podillia, remained an inconspicuous region on the outskirts of the empire, a land of Jewish settlements, Russian garrisons, Polish landlords, and Ukrainian peasants. In addition, the Volyn province included almost all of Polissia, almost the most remote corner of the empire west of Moscow.\nThe development of the region never truly restarted even in the modern times - now it is one of the least industrialized and prosperous of all Ukraine.

On the coast the Greeks built their cities and traded with the barbarians - Borisphen, Tira, Tanais... Once the grasses of the Black Sea steppe hid a horseman from his head, and that is why the Wild Field was a dream of every tribe that roamed the fierce Asian steppes. But the main law of the Great Steppe is that whatever you create, no sooner than in a century it will be trampled into the ground and overgrown with weeds. The legacy of the Wild Field - countless mounds among the plowed fields\nAt the end of the 19th century, life here was thriving: in the eastern part of Katerinoslav Governorate, the coal Donbas was being developed, in the western part an engineer Alexander Paul found the iron ore of Kryvbas, in neighboring [200.Controller.GetVictoryPointName_11405] the German Mennonites built mills and machine factories.

He draws attention to Korney's giftedness. At first, Kornei refuses to sell the paintings, but at the entreaties of Rita, who dreams of escaping from the countryside, gives in, and they go to town. The famous critic Mulin, having seen Kornei's paintings, is delighted with his rustic paintings and calls him "the master of primitivism". Fame and temptation descend upon Kornei: Vera, an elegant young socialite, writes a flattering article about the young artist and introduces Kornei to the local bohemian society.\nMeanwhile, Rita gets pregnant, and the couple get married. Vera comments with patronizingly disparaging sarcasm: the artist who married is dead to art. After such a characterization, Kornei's paintings are not in demand. At this time, the child becomes seriously ill, the money received earlier is spent on expensive treatment. And then the critic Mulin, who has long had his eye on Rita, convinces her to leave the pauper artist for him. Rita, hoping that this will stir up Korney's jealousy and talent, agrees. For some time, Korney remains strangely inactive, but he soon goes headlong into his art, once again achieving recognition. He recaptures Rita... and at the same time is unable to forgive her betrayal.\nThe sudden death of a child brings them together in grief, Rita and Kornei realize that life in the city has not brought them happiness, and decide to return to the village.\nMost of the film met only positive reviews."

Cherkasskyi, and from 1918 worked as an artist-decorator in Vinnytsia theater at Matvei Drak for the troupe of Hnat Yura, Amvrosiy Buchma and Marian Krushelnitskyi. From 1921 he became an artist in the Vinnytsia provincial department of the Commission for the Protection of Monuments of Art and Antiquity - formed for the city museum gallery and library from the collection of Duchess Branitskaia in the manor in Nemyriv. In 1923 he entered Kyiv Art Institute, Faculty of Painting, worked as a theater artist, and in 1925 transferred to the first course of the Faculty of Architecture. \n\nHowever, his career as an architect was rather limited. He participated in the design of various buildings in Kyiv, but was never in a managerial position. Now the projects provided by the young architect struck the Kyiv Rada. Perhaps these projects should be given a grant to transform Kyiv."

Conceived as a clubhouse, each floor is different from the previous one. The restaurant itself occupies four floors. \n\nThe building of the restaurant is located on a high site, the main facade faces west, and a granite staircase leads to it. The roof is hip, tin-roofed, over the rear volume - single slope with a slight slope; the overlap is flat. Composition of the building is symmetrical, it reflects the functional purpose of the building. The facades are very plastic. The dominant feature is a glazed rectangular bay window leaning on the roof of the entrance. In contrast to the vertical bay window, there are loggia-garages on the side facades of the first floor, balconies on the second floor and the third floor overhanging the side facades.

He defended the idea of an ensemble development of the area, taking into account the peculiarities of topography and environment, rather than the creation of random, unsuitable to each other or to a selected area of buildings. Here is how he himself described his design:\n\n\"From the viewpoint of the Dnieper River, the houses of the new residential complex are perceived as a picturesque silhouette on the background of greenery and water. Silhouette from the Dnieper does not have an independent character and fits into the landscape as part of it.\"\n\nArchitectural dominant of the quarter is a 10-storey apartment building in the style of constructivism. As one of the Kyiv newspapers reports, \"One of the best new buildings in the capital... Kyiv skyscraper\". "

In later years the chancellery of Kyiv governor-general, whose residence was located on the opposite side of Institutskaya Street, was placed there. In 1886 the authorities decided to sell the estate, dividing it into three plots. The most part of the estate on the corner of Instytutska and Sadova streets was given to Oleksandr Brodskyi, a cousin of Kyiv "sugar kings" Lev and Lazar Brodsky, the founder and director of South-Russian Society of Breweries, the first director of Kyiv Bacteriological Institute. \n\nHowever, after the Dyrektoria came to power, the site was nationalized and Brodskyi's mansion was demolished. The plot in its place was given to Karakis as a new canvas for his work. Knowing very well the architecture of the Kyiv houses, Iosyp Karakis used for the first time in his residential construction an internal staircase with an upper light, traditional for Kyiv in the past. To prove the validity of such a solution, the author decided to measure the lighting of the stairwell in the building. When the architect came in with a cumbersome luxmeter and saw the security guard reading a letter from home at the stairs, he realized that the need for any measurements was gone - there was enough light."

The house had an absolutely atypical for Kyiv gallery system, typical for the southern regions. Staircases were placed on both sides of the building; the entrance to the apartments was through an open gallery. This arrangement saved about 15% of the funds for the construction of the building. The house consists of one- and two-bedroom apartments. The stairwell is located in the center of the building. On the outside of the house the balconies are staggered, which is also atypical for Kyiv."

With these two districts actively developed by the architects and inviting more and more citizens to live there, Karakis introduced his own vision of communal houses.\n\nIn particular, he presented a plan for the development of Obolon: in order to create a silhouette of the city, he proposed pyramidal with terraced ledges, multi-storey buildings, standing at a certain calculated distance from each other. Despite the fact that his draft caused bewilderment among some of the city employees present at the meeting, the project was received favorably in the press.

Of course Karakis could not pass it by and presented his project, which he had coauthored with Kholostenko and Kisilevych, and which called for creating one main facade, which on the first and second floors was divided by pylons topped with allegorical sculptures.\n\nSurprisingly, however, another option was chosen in the competition. Designed in the Art Deco style, the department store had seven floors, high ceilings, marble staircases and an elevator. The new department store in Khreshchatyk became the second big department store in the central street after the Bessarabian covered market. The newly-erected building had a dominant position in the complex of buildings of the pre-war Khreschatyk, taking into consideration its location at the crossing of the two central highways of Kyiv and monumentally designed tower-shaped corner.

It is interesting to note that Jewish Theater project essentially included four different designs for the same theater. Only one of them was realized. The main facade of the realized project was exaggeratedly pompous: a spectacular portico, capitals with Ukrainian symbols, sculptures of a Jew and a Jewish woman in national costumes in the niches, two statues holding a shield with the Ukrainian coat of arms on the crowning tower-belvedere. The walls were enlivened by a high relief composition and a large Yiddish inscription: \"Jewish State Theater\". The capacity of the hall was 1050 seats.\n\nThe Jewish Theater building is a true decoration of Khreshchatyk Street: designed in the solid forms of late constructivism, typical for Karakis's works, this building is representative and monumental, with the spatial scale peculiar to the work of the Master."

During his leadership of the city police managed to keep the situation under control, to bring elementary order in the city, to put the city police to the proper level, to strengthen the discipline of personnel.\nLater he became one of the most talented detectives in Russia. Moving to Moscow, he inherited a well-oiled, smoothly operating investigative apparatus (in 1913 the Moscow Investigative Police was recognized as the best in Europe), and worthy successor to his predecessor.\n\nIn 1917, after the revolutionary events in Russia, one of the first steps of the new government was the abolition of the gendarmes and the police, which was replaced by the police. In the criminal investigation was without professionals in their field, so the new government still attracted the old cadres. Karl Marshalk, who was in charge of the search police in Moscow, also remained in service. One can imagine under what conditions he and others had to work, especially after the Kerensky's government announced a complete amnesty for criminals, releasing them from prison and thus bringing to naught all the work of pre-revolutionary detectives.\n\nAfter the beginning of the Red Terror in Russia, fearing for his life, he went to Ukraine and in September 1918 was appointed the city governor of Kyiv, the head of the Kyiv Derzhavna Varta (police) - the Kyiv City Otaman.\n\nThanks to the service of Karl Marshalk, the Kyiv Detective Police was now recognized as the best in Europe, at least in Mitteleuropa, which of course also had an impact on the almost total destruction of the opposition and the Borotbyst terrorists in Kyiv."

Nobles, landlords, the bourgeoisie, cultural and scientific figures, and intellectuals flocked to Ukraine. Kyiv has never seen such an influx of celebrities. It is enough to name just a few writers, both venerable and young, but already famous: Arkady Averchenko, Vlas Doroshevich, Evgeny Chirikov, Ivan Nazhivin, Don Aminado, Nikolai Agnivtsev, Ilya Ehrenburg, Viktor Shklovsky.\n\nThe famous Khanzhonkov Studio with its team of leading stars of Russian cinema, like Vera Kholodnaya and Ivan Mozzhukhin, settled in Yalta.

Just as long as there was meat and bread in the markets and no shooting in the streets, that, for God's sake, there were no Bolsheviks, and that the common people were not robbed. Well, all this was more or less realized under the Hetman, perhaps even to a great extent.

Hetman negotiated with Germany to create this formation in early 1919, marking the beginning of the creation of a new social class in Ukraine and, importantly, new German colonies. \n\nNevertheless, Germans had long been living in Ukraine: especially in the South and in Volhynia. In addition, the Germans have long had their own colonial settlements in the Crimea since the early 19th century, such as Neizatz, Friedenthal, Rosenthal in Simferopil district, and Heilbrun, Sudak and Herzenberg in Feodosiya district, and in the late 19th century in the Simferopil City Duma was already about 20% of the Germans, many of whom held high positions. According to the census of 1897 in the Crimea lived nearly 32 thousand Germans - 5.8% of the population of the Crimea.\n\nDespite the fact that Germans have long had their views on the Crimea, and we should obviously keep an eye on our legal peninsula, the German population has grown quite strong in Kherson, Odesa and Volyn. And quite a large number of the increase is due to Freikorps.

In any case, the fortress was erected on the site of the Cossack settlement of Volyn Prince Dmytro Vyshnevetskyi - Khortytsia Sich. Sich is the common name of multiple Cossack fortresses. Khortytsia Sich was erected on the largest Dnieper island of Khortytsia, now located in the city limits. However, the prince himself, soon after his fortress was destroyed, fled to the Russian Tsar Ivan the Terrible.\n\nIn connection with this historical reference, which deputies also provided to the government, several renaming options are proposed: Zaporizhzhia, as the name of the area \"Za Porogami\" (\"beyond the rapids\") of the Dnieper; Khortytsia, in honor of the Cossack fortress and island in the city; Vyshnevetskyi, in honor of the prince who built the fortress but proved to be Russophile; or Sich, in honor of all of the Cossack fortresses that existed on the banks of the Dnieper."

Mykhailo Kolodzinskyi outlined the borders of the future Ukrainian state, which should include in addition to the entire modern Ukraine, Moldavia, large parts of Romania, Poland, Belarus, Russia (up to the Middle Volga and the Caspian Sea), North Caucasus, Baku and Absheron peninsula with oil fields.\nHaving received much criticism as well for \"Ukrainian Imperialism\", the book is clearly inspired by Dmytro Dontsov’s teachings and to the majority of Ukrainian establishment and citizens it was just a nonsense."

Amidst the chaos and uncertainty, a powerful voice rises, advocating for a new path forward – the philosophy of Concordism, inspired by Volodymyr Vynnychenko. Vynnychenko, using his influence in the government, striving for stability and unity, has initiated a propaganda campaign to spread the ideals of Concordism throughout the nation.\n\nThe Voice of Unity campaign aims to awaken the consciousness of the Ukrainian people and foster a sense of shared purpose and solidarity. Through various channels, including newspapers, posters, and public speeches, the government seeks to communicate the principles of Concordism and inspire Ukrainians to embrace this vision of a harmonious society. Newspapers across the country print articles and opinion pieces penned by prominent intellectuals and supporters of Concordism. They discuss the benefits of social harmony, cooperation between different social classes, and the potential for a united Ukrainian nation. These articles provide historical examples of successful collaboration and highlight the strength that can be derived from unity.\n\nPublic speeches and rallies are organized in major cities and towns, where charismatic speakers eloquently present the tenets of Concordism. They stress the importance of working together for the betterment of Ukrainian society, highlighting the potential benefits for all social classes and nature. These speeches are carefully crafted to resonate with the aspirations and concerns of the diverse Ukrainian population, bridging the gaps that have divided them in the past."

ukrmisc.64.d: "In the wake of the Ukrainian struggle for independence, the newly established Ukrainian government faces the task of shaping the nation's political structure. Drawing upon the visionary ideas of Mykhailo Hrushevskyi, a renowned statesman and scholar, the government embarks on a comprehensive decentralization and administrative reform, seeking to establish a robust and effective governance system for an independent Ukraine.\nInspired by the principles of regional autonomy and federalism, Hrushevskyi's vision for Ukraine emphasizes the importance of empowering local governance. Under this reform, power is devolved from the central government, granting significant decision-making authority to local regions and communities. This shift aims to foster a sense of ownership, local initiative, and democratic participation, enabling Ukrainians to shape their own destiny.\n\nThe decentralization could gain widespread support from regional authorities, nationalist factions, and those eager to participate in the new democratic system. Local administrations will emerge as centers of power, with elected officials and labor soviets or trade-unions working diligently to address the needs and aspirations of their respective regions. This empowerment of local autonomy strengthens the fabric of Ukrainian society and facilitates a more inclusive and responsive governance structure.\nRecognizing the importance of a streamlined and efficient administrative apparatus, Hrushevskyi's reform also focuses on revamping Ukraine's bureaucratic system. His proposal entails simplifying administrative processes, reducing red tape, and enhancing transparency in governance. By modernizing and professionalizing the civil service, the reform aims to improve the delivery of public services and ensure effective policy implementation.\nAcknowledging the complexities of Ukraine's political landscape, Hrushevskyi advocates for a balanced approach that maintains a degree of centralization while granting meaningful regional autonomy. His reform proposal suggests the creation of a semi-autonomous system, where certain powers and responsibilities are delegated to the regions, while key national issues remain under the purview of the central government.\nIn the end, the proposal centers around a new administrative division."

One of them is Ivan Piddubnyi, a used-to-be famous athlete born in 1871 in near Poltava. \n\nPiddunyi used to be a world champion in freestyle wrestling in 1905-1909 and has had a nickname of "champion of champions". \nNow the athlete is in his middle 60-ties. He's not a wrestler anymore but he can be a very good coach for our team with all his invaluable experience.\n\nBut we're not the only ones wanting to make use of Piddubnyi's name and experience. We've received an unofficial message from German Olympic Committee that they want the ex-athlete to train their sportsmen.

ukrmisc.66.d: "Today the second reissue of Viacheslav Lypynskyi’s \"magnum opus\" and political treatise \"Lysty do brativ-khliborobiv\" (Epistles to the Brothers-Khliborobs) is coming out in all bookstores of the country - in honor of the 10-year anniversary of the publication. Lypynskyi had been writing this publication for 7 years, from 1919 to 1926, and it formed the ideological basis of Ukrainian Conservatism (Hetman Nationalism) and became the foundation for the two major political currents of the country - the USKhD and the SHD parties.\n\nLypynskyi is still perceived by many as a man of contradictions: a Polish nobleman who embraced the Ukrainian national struggle, a devout Catholic who advocated the exclusive spiritual role of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church, and the founder of the UDKhP, who later rejected the party he helped create.\n\n\"The Epistles\" serve as an exploration of Lypynskyi’s values: a vision of a classocratic society where the most enlightened can lead Ukraine toward its future without fear of the corrupting influence of liberal democracy and petty sectarianism."

ukrmisc.67.t: "The Union of Agrarian-Statists"
ukrmisc.67.d: "The USKhD arose in 1920, when Viacheslav Lypynskyi, then leader of the UDKhP, proposed a radical revision of the party program along neo-monarchist and corporatist principles. In his proposal, Lypynskyi fundamentally rejected partisan politics and parliamentarism, advocating a reorganization of politics along class lines. An idea counterintuitive to many, Lypynskyi believed that a society governed in this way would allow a \"class aristocracy\" of Ukraine's best and brightest to change the country for the better, without regard to faith or language. Nevertheless, the new party program was organically tied to the existing dictatorial Hetmanist regime - that still refused to convene any representation in the form of parliament. The UDKhP at the time, however, was perceived by the Hetman as an opposition party in general, dominated by national democrats and even republicans. This led to a split in the party, the creation of the USKhD with an updated program, and the further decay and disappearance of the UDKhP.\n\nThe subsequent history of the party was not easier than its beginnings. Despite all the anti-parliamentarianism of the party, its leadership, represented by Viacheslav Lypynskyi and Serhiy Shemet, was convinced that a representative body should still exist - namely a hierarchically constructed advisory council from among the members of the USKhD. In addition, Lypynskyi insisted on the adoption of a Constitution to replace the Hetman's \"Emergency Laws\". This found neither support nor understanding with Skoropadskyi himself, who sought to consolidate his rather unlimited power. Contradictions between the Hetman and his advisor led to the fact that the Hetman and a number of his supporters announced their withdrawal from the USKhD - a decision that meant immediate falling into Hetman's disfavor.\n\nIn 1927, when Hetman was forced to make concessions by outside forces, Ukraine became a kingdom, the State Soim was convened, and the USKhD officially became an opposition party. Given the lack of support from the Hetman, the USKhD began the search for new allies, and it was none other than the newly elected king of Ukraine, Vasyl. Now, with the tacit support of the King, the USKhD began to seek a sharp restriction of Hetman's power, and in general - combining the positions of the Hetman and the King in the face of Vasyl, who was to become the new, rightful Hetman.\n\nBe that as it may, times are changing, and the USKhD risks losing its relevance, and a serious shake-up of Ukrainian politics may be required to save it."

ukrmisc.68.t: "Independence Day"
ukrmisc.68.d: "The Ukrainian Kingdom officially recognizes January 22nd as the anniversary of Ukraine's independence from Russia. The official celebration is much more modest than one might expect, with the King and Hetman issuing statements saluting the spirit of the Ukrainian nation and vowing to defend it for decades. Other than these nods, nothing is heard from the government, which prefers to mind its own business as much as possible.\n\nTheir purpose is to avoid discussing what really happened on January 22nd, 1918. As they all know, Ukrainian independence was not declared by the current regime, and Pavlo Skoropadskyi had nothing to do with this act. Rather, it was the Central Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic, led by progressive and socialist forces, that affirmed Ukraine as \"a separate, independent, free, sovereign state of the Ukrainian people\" in its Fourth Universal. Although there is some continuity between the People's Republic and the current regime, the fact remains that the Hetmanate was founded in opposition to the People's Republic, which allowed the ideological enemy to assume responsibility for Ukraine's independence.\n\nAccordingly, Independence Day often has much more significance for opponents of the Hetmanate than for its supporters. The few remaining republican organizations sometimes choose this date for anti-government agitation, and celebrations in both Ukraine and neighboring Galicia are known to take on political proportions, with the infamous republican Symon Petliura taking the opportunity to deliver his own Independence Day message. The authorities often try to suppress these republican events: after all, who would arrest a man for celebrating the independence of his people?"

ukrmisc.69.t: "The Legacy of the People's Republic"
ukrmisc.69.d: "If the Ukrainian Kingdom is a symbol for Ukraine's conservatives, the People's Republic has become a symbol for its progressives: the Republican movements represent the main opposition to the state and its government, seeking the restoration of the republic and full democracy. They are led by the Directorate of the Ukrainian People's Republic in exile, or simply the Dyrektoria, an alliance of four parties that united to form a stronger anti-Hetmanate front. The Social Democratic Labour Party is the largest representative of the bloc, representing democratic socialism in the Marxist tradition and combining a proletarian view of social issues with a heavy emphasis on evolutionism. The USDRP is sometimes considered the informal leader of the bloc and of the republican trend as a whole, because of the large role played by Volodymyr Vynnychenko, the first Prime-Minister of UPR, and Symon Petliura, the former general secretary for military affairs, who is believed to have ties to the military.\n\nThe other two components of the Dyrektoria are the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries and the Ukrainian Communist Party. The PSR is the Ukrainian equivalent of the Russian Socialist-Revolutionaries, most of whom remained committed to revolutionary socialism and Ukrainian statehood. With a radical and agrarian program, the UPSR far surpassed its USDRP rivals in popularity in 1917, after which it split. The Ukrainian Communists were also formed from a split - former members of the USDRP, who had infamous ties with the Bolsheviks, but who soon renounced that disastrous movement. The Ukapists are now united on a common platform of national-communism.\n\nIn the republican cause there is also a critical faction of non-socialists concentrated in the Liberal Democratic Party. ULD(S-F) - supporters of parliamentarism and decentralization, seeking support in the old socialist-federalist movement, but also ready to accept the status of Ukraine as a neutral but strong \"Switzerland of Eastern Europe\"."

ukrmisc.70.t: "Remembering Kruty"
ukrmisc.70.d: "Every nation has its own myths: collective memories created to reinforce a shared sense of history and identity. Such myths have been created at least since the emergence of modern nationalism, and Ukraine is no exception. For Ukrainians, one of the most significant myths is related to the events of January 29, 1918. On that day, about 500 cadets defended the railway station of Kruty, 150 kilometers northwest of Kyiv, from a vastly superior Bolshevik force. About a hundred defenders fell before the survivors were forced to retreat, but their sacrifice delayed the Bolshevik advance on Kyiv and allowed the People's Republic to conclude the Berestia Treaty before evacuating the city.\n\nThe battle of Kruty received little attention at the time, as Kyiv was in chaos due to the simultaneous uprising at the Arsenal plant - but when the Republic returned to the city in March, the myth of the battle began to be created. The remains of the defenders of Kyiv were solemnly reburied to the praise of high-ranking politicians, and Skoropadskyi established a memorial tradition early in his administration, supposedly approving a monument to the fallen at Kruty, which was later erected on the site. However, memories of the battle were also politicized to a certain extent. Hetmanist figures sometimes view the battle as proof of the incompetence of the Republic: in their view (actually dubious), young, inexperienced and under-equipped students were abandoned by their drunken commanders and sent to certain death. Republican commemorations of the Kruty are less accusatory.\n\nThe battle is also the focus of the peripheral Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO), for whom the event perfectly reflects their preferred narratives: reverence for martyrdom and the heroic self-sacrifice of youth for the nation. Derzhavna Varta notes the distribution in the Chernihiv garrison of UVO pamphlets on this occasion, linking the battle to their brand of military nationalism."

ukrmisc.71.t: "The Ukrainian Military Organisation"
ukrmisc.71.d: "In 1920, Yevhen Konovalets, hero of the War of Independence, leader of the Legion of Ukrainian Sich Striltsi, and informally recognized leader of the nationalist movement among the Ukrainian armed forces, announced the creation of a veteran nationalist organization, the Ukrainian Military Organization. For a long time the organization was quite elitist - the number of members did not exceed 2,000, and it included active and retired servicemen. However, everything changed in 1928.\n\nDuring 1928 and 1929, the little-known civil servant and publicist Dmytro Dontsov published a series of articles on the condition of the Ukrainian Kingdom. In his opinion, the events of 1927 heralded the coming of an era of great catastrophes and showed the inability of either the King, Hetman, or Soim to prevent them. Dontsov believed that only the will and dedication of a distinguished \"caste\" under the leadership of the supreme ruler could save Ukraine from impending doom. Dontsov announced the creation of a party to represent the interests of Ukrainian nationalists, the UPNR (Ukrainian Party of National Work), but it went unnoticed and unpopular.\n\nHowever, Dontsov's doctrine has attracted the attention of the UVO. Konovalets, while privately criticised Dontsov, has adopted some of Dontsov's points for his mass nationalist movement based on the Ukrainian Military Organization. Since then, the UVO has positioned itself precisely as a political, not just military, force - but one that ignores participation in the current political system.\n\nThe UVO began to occupy the niche of right-wing populists - promoting ethnic Ukrainian nationalism, the unity of the nation, and a self-sustaining economy. Their tactics echo those of the Romanian Legion and, ironically, of Savinkovist People's Republicanism: UVO activists travel the countryside to help peasants and hold special literacy classes to garner support.\n\nDespite modest successes, the UVO struggles to challenge socialist and republican domination of the disaffected peasantry. More powerful are their military connections. Even so, many doubt that they can really be a viable force under current conditions: the UVO simply cannot be a popular movement when socialists and republicans still enjoy peasant support."
ukrmisc.71.a: "How many agrarian populists can you even fit in this country?"

ukrmisc.72.t: "Day of the Hetmanate"
ukrmisc.72.d: "The Ukrainian Kingdom is inextricably linked with the institution of the Hetmanate. In many ways Pavlo Skoropadskyi has been the driving force behind the state since its inception: although the Otaman-Ministers have headed the governments of the state since the end of the Weltkrieg, only the Hetman has the right to appoint them and thereby determine the nature of government. By design, the Hetman was seen by his supporters as the guarantor of the state and society and a bulwark against radical politics. After all, the state was founded with the support of landowning interests and the German military and lost no time in returning to republican social reforms.\n\nBecause Ukraine's Independence Day has republican connotations, the government and its supporters prefer April 29, the anniversary of Skoropadskyi's election as Hetman, as the main national holiday. Traditionally, a military parade is held in Kyiv to mark the holiday, after which the Hetman gives a public speech praising the state's achievements over the past year. Many official events on April 29 are military or paramilitary in nature - perhaps a reflection of where the state's support comes from.\n\nThe only thing missing from this parade of celebrations is King's Day, which seems to be the only member of Ukraine's ruling elite who has not had a holiday of his own. But this does not matter to Hetman, who, despite losing more control over the country, still has enough political power to abolish this alien element of the Ukrainian political system."

ukrmisc.72.b: "Tell me about the Hetmanists."

ukrmisc.73.t: "The Hetmanist Movement"
ukrmisc.73.d: "Politically, the Hetmanate has been represented by several conservative organizations since its inception. The first party in power was the Union of Landowners (VSZV), an organization of large landowners, which directly brought Skoropadsky to power. Already in the summer of 1917, the Democratic-Agrarian Party (UDKhP), which included many nationally concerned landowners, was formed, and the VSZV became perceived in many ways as a Russophile organization because of their contradictory decisions regarding language. In 1920, the UDKhP also split and was replaced by the USKhD. None of these organizations, however, ever led the Hetman's government, as he emphasized personal appointment.\n\nFinally, around 1925 the Hetman's own political movement emerged, as another split from USKhD. Called the Union of Hetmanists-Statists (SHD) and led personally by Hetman, the party became the stronghold of the Hetmanate's absolutist regime. When in 1928 the first Soim was convened, the SHD became the dominant party in the parliament, even though the elections since then were perceived by the opposition as unfair and corrupted. The Union of Hetmanists-Statists stay as the political majorant of the Hetmanist regime. Uniting various politicians, the SHD does not really have a united platform, apart from support for Hetman and general tendency of Lypynskyite 'Ukrainian Conservatism'. It is rather separate personalities, that tend to influence Hetman in his various decisions. Among them are Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, the 'Gentleman Usher' of the Hetman's palace, who sees Ukraine's future in its ties with the traditional Hetmanate of the past, and Vasyl Kochubei - a large landowner and gentry from the Poltava region, who is said to be affiliated with the VSZV. Less key figures include Borys Homzyn, Mykola Sakhno-Ustymovych, Liudvih Sidletskyi and others. All of them are in shadow of Hetman's dominant position as the SHD's only benefactor - and it's only in Skoropadskyi's authority to decide the Union's political direction."

ukrmisc.75.t: "The Borotbysts"
ukrmisc.75.d: "The Ukrainian Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries (Borotbysts), more commonly known as the Borotbysts, has its roots as a Marxist splinter faction of the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries. Proto-Borotbyst guerilla forces were one of many operating in Ukraine during 1918 and 1919, fighting against the Ukrainian State and seeking the establishment of a Ukrainian communist government. The movement was driven underground in 1920 and, united under the charismatic leadership of Oleksandr Shumskyi, declared their split from the UPSR, denouncing UPSR as a bourgeois party due to its constant concessions to the social democrats. They also did not join the Dyrektoria neither truly become 'exiled' to Galicia, as the other left parties, opting to bide its time until 1925, when it waged its notorious campaign of agitation and revolutionary violence against the government.\n\nObserving successful syndicalist revolutions in France and Britain, the party adopted some of the syndicalist ideas into its own model, synthesising it with their previous both Narodnik and Marxist program. As their present name suggests, the result was a mixture of council anarcho-syndicalist and Marxist ideas - but unlike many Western syndicalists, the Borotbysts view agricultural 'labourers' as critical to a Ukrainian revolution, and seek to give them a leading role in it. The Borotbysts have also held left nationalist views, as most of the left parties.\n\nFor over 15 years, the Borotbysts have pursued a strategy of confrontation with the Hetmanate, most exemplified by their 1925 campaign. While this approach keeps them in the minds of the Ukrainian workers, it has also drawn the permanent ire of Hetmanists: as such, the movement faces near-constant pressure that makes it difficult to grow - though still the most popular of the leftist parties. It is difficult to see the Borotbysts succeeding as long as the Hetmanate places importance on their destruction - and the latest strikes due to the economic crisis prove the point. The Borotbysts are here to fight, but the Hetmanate is also here to stay."

The city, founded in the shadow of Empress Catherine II's patronage, is now poised for a symbolic transformation. Several proposals have emerged, each carrying its own resonance with the evolving narrative of Ukrainian identity. The first suggestion advocates for a return to geographic roots, with the city potentially taking on the name of the mighty river it embraces. The citizens are torn between the simplicity of 'Dnipro' and the poetic 'Dniproslav,' both embodying a renewed connection with the land. A second proposal resonates with the proud legacy of the Sich Cossacks who once roamed these lands.

ukrmisc.79.d: "The issue of personal residences and government buildings for the leadership of Ukraine has long been a concern in our young nation. After taking power in 1918, Hetman Skoropadskyi was quick to make his home in the Palace of the Governor-General of Ukraine, evicting the Rada of the Ukrainian People's Republic which had made it into their base of operations. Skoropadskyi set about transforming the palace back into a personal residence, eventually renaming it the \"Palace of the Hetman\".\n\nYet for most of the Hetmanate's early years, its ruler hardly spent a night here, instead serving on the frontlines of the civil war until 1920. The various Ukrainian governments were just as itinerant, meeting at various universities, theatres and clubs until the Troitske People's House and the Museum of Pedagogy were respectively designated as the temporary sites of the Hetman's government and of the Soim, but turned out to be permanent. One problem was left unresolved, the housing situation for the Otaman-Minister, our Head of Government.\n\nUntil recently, all Otaman-Ministers have lived in private residences, which naturally pale in glamour to the Palace of the Hetman. It was decided a few years back that in order to recognize the importance of the Otaman-Minister and to expedite issues of communication that an official Government Dacha would be built. A perfect locale was found at the dacha which once housed the 19th century Russian governor Illarion Vasilchikov before being donated to a local monastery after his death. Through the expert work of the architect Serhiy Hryhoriev, we've managed to reconstruct it into a modern building equipped with all the necessities one might require. [GetPrimeMinister] has attended the ribbon cutting ceremony and already made plans to move in, holding the privilege of being the first man to occupy the Government Dacha."

ukrmisc.80.d: "Esperantism came into vogue in Ukraine around the turn of the 20th century, when it was picked up by idealists who believed that a \"universal language\" could solve the conflicts between the Russian and Ukrainian speakers. Early adopters included men such as Mykola Borovko, Volodymyr Harnet and Mykhailo Yurkiv, who translated nationalist poetry into the language and distributed the first Esperanto materials in Ukraine. The Galician educators Pavlo Bozhemskyi and Orest Kuzma then inherited the movement, creating the Esperanto Society \"Progreso\" (Progress) in 1910 and the newspaper \"Ukraina Stelo\" (Ukrainian Dawn) three years later.\n\nTheir dreams of utopian peace and coexistence in Ukraine were shattered by the advent of the Weltkrieg, during which they went underground. They resurfaced in 1921 and made inroads into central and eastern Ukraine, leading to the creation of the \"Tutukrainia komitato de Esperanto\" (All-Ukrainian Esperanto Committee) to coordinate their activities.

ukrmisc.81.d: "After almost two years of work, the perennial Ukrainian filmmaker Oleksandr Dovzhenko has released his latest film, \"Zahublenyi i Vidnaydenyi Ray\" (Paradise Lost and Found), inspired by his deep love for the Ukrainian nation and his long exile in the Commune of France. It is the first among his many works of art to have actually been filmed on location in Ukraine, to much celebration. It follows the story of a utopian settlement in the Ukrainian wilderness, as it slowly transforms into a modern metropolis while enduring attacks from enemies opposed to its unique way of life; a mixture of communal living and technocratic rational planning.\n\nThis has been interpreted by critics as being either a positive allegory for the renaissance of left-wing Ukrainian Republicanism or, according to Dovzhenko's more hard-line detractors, a way of romanticising the old Hetmanate's ideas of Classocracy. Dovzhenko's supporters have praised the film as an ode to the potential of the Ukrainian nation, attempting to reconcile the forces of nature with the forces of modernity. Unlike Dovzhenko's prior works which were grounded in the Communard school of \"Proletarian Realism\", the film is quite intensively symbolic, \"romantic to the point of exhaustion\" as one of Dovzhenko's collaborators noted with sly wit. References to specific nationalities, cultures and political movements, even those of Ukraine, are hidden behind layers of allegory.\n\nThough the wider public has scratched their heads, there has been celebration from Dovzhenko's preferred audience, the avant garde left, with screenings of the film being held not just in Ukraine but also by his old peers in Paris and London. The mixed response has not intimidated Dovzhenko and the man renowned as the \"First Poet of the Cinema\" has immediately returned to work on his next project."
ukrmisc.81.a: "Wait, I don't get it, was it about the Hetmanate or Republic?"
ukrmisc.81.b: "What a strange man... tell me more about this amateur!"

ukrmisc.82.t: "The First Poet of the Cinema"
ukrmisc.82.d: "Dovzhenko is a curious fixture of Ukrainian cinema; he descended from poor Cossacks, but grew up to become a teacher and one of the founders of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts in Kyiv. While initially a supporter of the Hetmanate in 1918, Dovzhenko confessed that he had entered the Ukrainian national revolution \"through the wrong door\", becoming an outspoken opponent of Skoropadskyi after the Hetman introduced conscription among the students of Kyiv. He later drifted between Vynnychenko’s Dyrektoria and the Borotbysts, until the victory of the Hetman forced Dovzhenko to flee his homeland and seek refuge in France.\n\nIn 1925 he took up work as an intern in the French film industry. There he learned the tools of the trade, beginning to write his own scripts that were often comedies parodying and referencing other popular films. Dovzhenko eventually began to produce his own political films, putting together a motley crew of fellow Ukrainian exiles to help him write and direct his esteemed \"Ukrainian Trilogy\", consisting of \"Zvenyhora\", \"Arsenal\" and \"Zemlia\" (Earth), which he described as \"Cinematic Poetry\" and as an attempt to create a \"Ukrainian Iliad\" that covered the entire history of his homeland. Though all three of these pictures were filmed in France, Dovzhenko was adamant about wanting to try to recreate an authentic Ukrainian culture on his sets.\n\nAlongside his nationalist sentiments, Dovzhenko's socialist politics were also obvious in these works, such as how in \"Zvenyhora\" and \"Zemlia\" he highlighted the aspirations of the Ukrainian peasantry for land reform and economic liberty, while in \"Zvenyhora\" and \"Arsenal\" his depictions of the Ukrainian Civil War carried with them a sense of melancholy over the failures of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the Borotbysts, a sombre dream of what could have been had they defeated the Hetman back then. Nevertheless, these early films were still highly grounded and carried a strict appeal to land, liberty and national tradition, a far cry from his recent, more esoteric works like \"Zahublenyi i Vidnaydenyi Ray\" (Paradise Lost and Found)."
ukrmisc.82.a: "Perhaps \"romantic to the point of exhaustion\" was right..."

ukrmisc.83.t: "Production on Taras Bulba Halted"
ukrmisc.83.d: "For the last ten years, the esteemed Ukrainian director Oleksandr Dovzhenko has been working on an adaptation of the 19th century Cossack novel \"Taras Bulba\", penned by Nikolai Gogol. The director had recently entered into collaboration with the renowned Cossack historian Dmytro Yavornytskyi to guarantee the film's authenticity. The two men promised that the script was near completion, with Dovzhenko even recently returning from scouting out filming locations in Crimea, but many of his peers expressed their scepticism whether this decade-long project would actually bear fruition anytime soon.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears the worst has come to pass and production will be halted on Dovzhenko's magnum opus for the indefinite future, as the declaration of war with Russia has made it too dangerous to film in Crimea. Additionally, several of the leading actors in the film, such as the young Mykola Dupak who was set to play the Cossack hero Taras Bulba's erudite son Andrii, have announced that they wish to volunteer in the Ukrainian armed forces rather than spend the war on film sets or the theatre stage. Dovzhenko has seconded this opinion and presented himself at the service of our government, who has requested his aid in shooting propaganda films in support of the war effort.\n\nThis has come with some ambivalence; whilst Dovzhenko is disappointed that his masterpiece has to be delayed further, it is clear that he is outraged at the Russian enemy and has already begin to pen fiery rhetoric against them, such as a short journalistic essay entitled \"Ukraine on Fire\" which has already found praise amongst both common soldiers, officers and government officials."
ukrmisc.83.a: "Slava Ukrainyi! The Poet of the Cinema fights by our side!"

ukrmisc.84.t: "Taras Bulba Released"
ukrmisc.84.d: "In spite of the fire and bloodshed that Ukraine has endured, we have survived, and so have the dreams of the great director Oleksandr Dovzhenko. His decades-long project, adapting the 19th century novel \"Taras Bulba\" into film, has finally been completed and is now showing on the silver screen. The history of Taras Bulba is complicated, penned in the 19th century by the Ukrainian born writer Nikolai Gogol, the work itself as well as its author have always been disputed between Ukrainian and Russian nationalists. Though Gogol was born to a long line of Ukrainian Cossacks, he primarily moved in Russian literary circles. As a man of two worlds, he famously remarked that he did not give preference to neither the Russian nor the Ukrainian nationalist cause, leading both sides to often claim him as their own.\n\nWhile Dovzhenko may favour the Ukrainian position in this cultural conflict, he has tried to avoid reopening old wounds left behind by the Second Weltkrieg. \"Taras Bulba\", set in the early 17th century, tells the story of how a brave Ukrainian Cossack hero and his sons rise up to rebel against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. While the original novel's narrative portrays the Poles as being supported by Jews, Crimeans and other collaborators, Dovzhenko has tried to depict a more nuanced narrative, presenting the foreign hegemons as enticing both the Christian, Jewish and Muslim populations of Ukraine to follow their will. Other notable changes include the omission of Gogol's reverence for the Russian Tsar when the rebel Ukrainians cry out for a liberator to save them, choosing to use a more ambiguous description of a leader or father figure who will deliver them from oppression.\n\nLastly, the film features several allegories for the Ukrainian People's Republic, depicting this piece of 17th century Ukrainian resistance as part of a broader struggle against foreign domination of all kinds, particularly the one of foreign capital from Berlin, Austria and Moscow."
ukrmisc.84.a: "Congratulations to Dovzhenko!"

ukrmisc.85.t: "Lily"
ukrmisc.85.d: "A new artistic endeavour has been sweeping the Ukrainian theatre scene, as both the patrons of the arts and creatives dedicate their efforts towards supporting the war against Russia. \"Lileia\" (Lily) is a dramatic and nationalistic ballet, with a libretto written by Vsevolod Chagovets who has also organised the staging and a riveting score composed by Kostiantyn Dankevych. The origin of the story is derived from poems and ballads by the august 19th century Ukrainian poet Taras Shevchenko, particularly his collection Kobzar (The Minstrel). Rather than a direct adaptation of any single work, the play is a compilation of many different parts of Kobzar, meant to create a unified narrative.\n\nThe opening performance was held at the National Opera of Ukraine in [202.GetName], telling the story of a young Ukrainian peasant girl named Lileia, living in a 1820s Ukraine that is viciously oppressed by the Romanov dynasty, or the \"Muscovites\" as the play calls them. She falls in love with a fellow peasant, named Stepan, but after petitioning the cruel Muscovite Prince who administers their village for permission to marry, she finds herself the object of his perverse desires. When the Prince attempts to kidnap Lileia, she and Stepan are spirited away by their fellow villagers but end up separated along the way. Stepan is eventually captured by the Prince's men and blinded, but remains undeterred by this mutilation, He takes up the life of an errant minstrel, travelling rallying the people of Ukraine to his side through music.\n\nAfter reuniting with Lileia, the two are once again set upon by the Muscovite Prince. Lileia takes a mortal blow meant for her lover, with her death inspiring Stepan and the Ukrainian peasants to rise up in rebellion and execute the Prince, whereafter they promise to create a new nation of equal men, free of tyranny. The striking tale of oppression, martyrdom and rebellion has been heralded as an allegory for Ukraine's long struggle against Russian hegemony."
ukrmisc.85.a: "Most interesting."

ukrmisc.86.t: "Red Flag"
ukrmisc.86.d: "As the winds of change sweep across Ukraine, the struggle for independence intensifies. Among the impassioned activists striving for a brighter future, a young USDRP member named Petro has taken up a noble cause. Fueled by the revolutionary fervor and the power of music, Petro has set out to translate the iconic socialist anthem, \"Red Flag\", into Ukrainian. His hope is to inspire his fellow countrymen with a powerful anthem of their own.\n\nThere are two options for him. To translate \"Red Flag\" faithfully, staying true to its original lyrics and message or to truly ignite the flames of patriotism, to adapt \"Red Flag\" to reflect the Ukrainian experience and aspirations. \n\nWith unwavering dedication, he delves deep into Ukrainian literature and linguistic nuances to capture the essence of the song. As word spreads about Petro's endeavor, support from within the USDRP and the wider community starts to grow."
ukrmisc.86.a: "Stay true to Labour song!"
ukrmisc.86.b: "It should be a song close to Ukrainian heart!"

ukrmisc.87.t: "The People's Flag"
ukrmisc.87.d: "Petro skillfully reworks the lyrics of Red Flag, infusing them with the spirit of Ukrainian identity and the fight against foreign oppressors. This adaptation, while departing from the original text, seeks to establish a stronger emotional connection with the Ukrainian people. It sings of the struggle of liberation and of the Ukrainian flag brought by Laboring masses and socialists through occupations and world wars. It ends with the cry to hold the flag of liberation of workers from national and social oppression.\n\nThe Ukrainian adaptation of \"Red Flag\" gains popularity, particularly among the working class and nationalist factions. Some criticize the changes made to the original lyrics, arguing that it dilutes the internationalist spirit of the song. However, Petro's efforts succeed in energizing the Ukrainian populace, with the translated anthem becoming a rallying cry for those seeking independence and self-determination.\n\n\nSo raise the red flag high and proud,\nIn Ukraine, our voices loud,\nIn unity we stand, undeterred,\nFor the socialist dream, our hearts are stirred!"
ukrmisc.87.a: "Ukrainian people, strong and true, The socialist movement, we march with you!"

ukrmisc.88.t: "Though Cowards Flinch..."
ukrmisc.88.d: "The Ukrainian translation of \"Red Flag\" resonates strongly with the people, sparking a renewed sense of unity and purpose. Petro's efforts gained him widespread recognition and admiration, bolstering the popularity of the USDRP and the independence movement in Ukraine. The translated anthem becomes a symbol of hope and determination, inspiring countless Ukrainians in their struggle for freedom.\n\nThe song is sung all over the world by Ukrainian diaspora and their supporters, crowds in Canada, Union of Britain, Ireland and America, of Ukrainian diaspora and friendly to their cause, socialists singing together, ending with the shouting “Slava Ukraini!” — “Glory to the democratic republican cause!”"
ukrmisc.88.a: "The socialist movement united as one!"

ukrmisc.90.t: "The Finnish Otaman"
ukrmisc.90.d: "Retired Finnish general Kaarlo Kivekäs, or here better known as Edvard Karlovych, arrived in person to Ukraine, wishing to congratulate the new regime. As a private person this was quite odd, but he was received by Petliura nonetheless. The jovial old man had fought under Petliura after Ukrainisation of his 113. Rifle Division in 1917, and had been well liked by his men. Some of the former officers of the 113. Division organised tour for the old Otaman, visiting Dubno and other locations across [792.GetName] where Kivekäs had fought successfully against the Bolsheviks and the Germans before being imprisoned by the Skoropadskyi regime.\n\nKivekäs was a quite figure. Unlike Mannerheim and other Finnish Tsarist generals, he was not Finnish Swedish but from humble peasant family, and had kept that demeanour ever since. He had served decades in Central Asia, teaching himself to use sword like a Cossack and learning Tajik, Kyrgyz and Uzbek. The general continued to insist that there Turkic languages must be related to Finnish. He even took Tajik orphan Gul-Begim as his adoptive daughter Olga, as she would have been otherwise married against her will. Olga was accompanying her father in Ukraine, having lived in [192.GetName] much of her youth. The old man's visit stretched to entire week, as he wished to know every detail of the victorious struggle of the People's Army, and seemed to take great pride in success of the cause he had helped decades before. After petition by his former comrades in military, Kivekäs was awarded Cross of the Order of Liberation 2nd Class for his service for Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917-1918."

ukrmisc.91.t: "History of Ukraine-Rus"
ukrmisc.91.d: "The final tome of Mykhailo Hrushevskyi's \"History of Ukraine-Rus\", covering the events from 1657 to 1658, has been published today. Hrushevskyi's ten-volume treatise has become his magnum opus and a comprehensive history of Ukraine.\n\nHrushevskyi's work has been crucial for conceptualisation of Ukrainian historical process as continuous and independent from the all-Russian historical narrative. Some analysts have tended to assign Hrushevskyi's to a \"populist\" tendency of Ukrainian historiography, which emphasises the critical role of the masses in the conceptual representation of the past. This school of thought is usually contrasted with the \"statist\" tendency, most notably represented by Viacheslav Lypynskyi, Stepan Tomashivskyi and Dmytro Doroshenko and focused on the role of national elites in the statebuilding process.\n\nThe claim that Hrushevskyi's analysis lies in any particular school of thought is perhaps rather misleading, given that his works are based on a quite broad intellectual foundation. But they have also found a special place among the Ukrainian republican movement (rather unsurprisingly, given the critical role Hrushevskyi had played in the establishment of Ukrainian People's Republic in 1917), with many subscribing to the historical narrative Hrushevskyi has put forth. The coming of the final volume has especially been celebrated by the pro-republican \"Austro-Ukrainian Friendship Association\", which has sought to finance a print of the entire ten volume edition in order to celebrate the occasion."
ukrmisc.91.a: "The work of more than thirty years is finally concluded."

ukrmisc.92.t: "Animated Innovations in [192.GetName]"
ukrmisc.92.d: "A little known facet of Ukrainian culture is our home grown animation industry, which has recently been receiving wider international attention. It originated at Odesa Film Studio, a company formed when native Ukrainian film studios merged after struggling to stay afloat after the civil war, under the auspices of a man named Viacheslav Levandovskyi who is praised as the father of Ukrainian animation. A student of ballet and a graduate of the [202.GetName] Academy of Arts, Levandovskyi was drawn to the [192.GetName] film industry where he initially worked with puppets, stop-motion animation and rotoscoping, creating the first Ukrainian animated film \"Solomianyi Bychok\" (Straw Bull) in 1927.\n\nHe soon grew interested in \"celluloid animations\" developed by Walt Disney Productions and Fleischer Studios, as well as the use of sound synchronised with animation. Levandovskyi and other Ukrainian animators were mainly introduced to these concepts through the cultural magazine Dilo (The Deed), published in Galicia but which was shared among intellectual circles in Ukraine. In time Levandovskyi moved away from puppets and started using cel animation, beginning work on his most well-known cartoon, \"Tuk-Tuk ta yoho pryiatel Zhuk\" (Tuk-Tuk and his friend Zhuk) in 1928.\n\nThis was an attempt to create a pair of serial mascots for Ukrainian animation, characters akin to Mickey Mouse or Betty Boop, who could appear in many different cartoons. The miniature boy Tuk-Tuk and his canine companion Zhuk have starred in three stories so far, all made by Levandovskyi alongside his colleagues Ipolit Lazarchuk, Serhii Kononchuk, Semen Huietskyi and Yevhen Horbach over the course of the last decade. They've found immense popularity among Ukrainian children and helped elevate animation as a reputable new art form. Just as Levandovsky was himself inspired by foreign ideas, Ukrainian cartoons have spread throughout the Reichspakt and in Galicia, where they might in turn help inspire other animators."

ukrmisc.93.d: "With work on the resorts in [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] well underway, the planning committee in charge of overseeing the works has recently began to debate a rather interesting idea: the establishment of a zeppelin station as part of the resort's new infrastructure. The zeppelin is perhaps one of history's more unique methods of transportation and during the inter-war period commercial zeppelin usage underwent something of a golden age.\n\nWith [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName] being transformed into a model resort city, it seems an interesting idea to construct a state of the art zeppelin station to ferry in even more passengers and ease the burden on the rail lines. However, naysayers among the committee see it as a costly vanity project and instead have urged the money to be used on improving the city's public transport networks."
ukrmisc.93.a: "Use the money to fund public transport instead!"

ukrmisc.94.t: "Zeppelin Explosion In [137.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]!"
ukrmisc.94.d: "In shocking news from Crimea it has emerged that a zeppelin that had just left port has exploded with all passengers and crew confirmed dead. Whole search teams have been dispatched to scour the waters for the remains of the deceased. Witnesses to the incident have described the explosion as erupting suddenly and \"painting the sky orange and red\" with the wreckage shortly falling into the sea. An official estimate as to how many were wounded by the wreckage has not been calculated yet but fortunately the number is expected to be low.\n\nWith the city on lockdown, the cause of the incident and whether or not foul play was involved is still a mystery. Regardless the government has declared that all zeppelins are to be grounded until further notice and it is expected a full-scale ban on the transport will follow shortly assuming this really was an accident."

ukrmisc.95.t: "Ukraines of Many Colours"
ukrmisc.95.d: "As tensions continue to mount over the border with Russia, a strange development took place in [221.GetName]. An activist appeared before a crowd, agitating the onlookers with wild proclamations about vast support that he has been able to secure during the past few years among... the Ukrainians of Zakytaishchyna, also known as \"Green Ukraine\", in the Russian Far East.\n\nRambling about the constant failures of the Russian state in providing even the most meagre living standards for its citizens, he finished his speech with a promise: local Ukrainians, languishing in despair, are ready to revolt and cast away the Russian yoke. The only thing required is additional funds, which he is so desperately needing all around Ukraine. Some among the crowd were listening with curiosity, others with mild interest; some would even compare this charade to that of Hetman Mazepa giving wild promises to the Swedish King. Still, the string of these performances would be cut short with the man vanishing without a trace, only a series of warrants for fraud reminding of him. Similar \"guests\" have already appeared on numerous occasions, claiming to represent the interests of downtrodden Ukrainians of Belgorod, Kursk or Kuban, spreading the idea of Ukrainian expansion towards these regions.\n\nBut the Far East, a region so disconnected from the Ukrainian heartland? Some remained confused, unaware that modern Russia harbours various Ukrainian minorities within its borders.\n\nIndeed, from the Black Sea coast of the Kuban to the far eastern region of Zakytaishchyna, one could find communities of Ukrainians living both around the Volga river (so called \"Yellow Ukraine\") and beyond the Ural Mountains (\"Grey Ukraine\"). While the populations of the first two regions entertained the idea of unification with Ukraine proper during the Russian revolution, inhabitants of the two latter ones were focused on securing more autonomy from the Russian state."

Soon enough Boidunyk became chairman of the youth organization and a member of the editorial board of the journal \"Natsionalna Dumka\" (National Thought). It was under his aegis and authorship that in 1929 the journal published an interesting and wonderfully popular article, \"The Ukraine's Sobornost and Its Eastern Frontiers\".\n\nIn this article, Boidunyk presented his view of the prospects for Ukrainian expansion to the east - in contrast to the generally accepted doctrine adopted by Skoropadskyi in 1918, where the borders of Ukraine in the east ended in Bilhorodshchyna, Rostiv and Kuban, Boidunyk argued that such borders would leave hundreds of thousands of ethnic Ukrainians in Stavropilie "behind the border. In addition, the German-Russian Minsk peace officially \"closed the road\" to Ukrainian aspirations in the east.\n\nNow that the UVO has asserted its rights and the rights of the Ukrainian people to collectivity and independence, Boidunyk, as a member of the Provid, is making every attempt to convince the other members of the Provid, including [GetLeader] to accept his doctrine of eastern borders."

The region of [997.GetName], which was a natural claim of Ukraine, was also claimed by the Belarus. Eventually, the Germans have decided for our nations - and splitted the region. While [93.GetName] and [241.GetName] remained an integral part of Ukraine, the regions of [95.GetName] and [194.GetName] were given to Belarus.\n\nThis caused a number of diplomatic annoyances between our nations. But as the Hetman Skoropadskyi said himself: 'Belarus is like a helmet for Ukraine', meaning that keeping good relations with our Northern neighbor is vital for our independence. With the now full independence of both our countries from the German Kaiser, it has become clear that we should sign a non-aggression pact with Belarus as soon as possible."

On the one hand, the city of Lemberg is in majority Polish and Jewish, while Ukrainians there are a significant minority. That means that if we want to control that land, we should be connected to it through land. That means that the new border should go east and south of Lemberg city borders, splitting Eastern Galicia in equal halfs.\nOn the other hand, the Ukrainians are unlikely to accept our terms and they will likely insist of having Lemberg, as a notable capital of Eastern Galicia in their own use."

ukrfor.81.t: "Germany Threatens Us!"
ukrfor.81.d: "The German government has threatened to declare war on our state, if we will officially leave their economic and military alliance. The Huns made it clear that they view us only as their puppet state. Our true independence is therefore not possible."
ukrfor.81.a: "Come and take, if you dare."

ukrfor.82.t: "Ukraine Accepts Our Terms!"
ukrfor.82.d: "The Ukrainian government has accepted our terms. They will stay as a part of Mitteleuropa as well as guarantee the holdings of German nationals."
ukrfor.82.a: "A victory for our foreign ministry!"

ukrfor.83.t: "Ukraine Demands Higher Tarrifs!"
ukrfor.83.d: "The Ukrainian government has argued that the tariffs for their supplies of foodstuffs and bread to Germany has not really increased over time, but were even lowered. They demand to end the terms of the Brotfrieden and want to ensure that their export is based on market prices, meaning we will have to import much less food from Ukraine for the old price."
ukrfor.83.a: "Seems reasonable."
ukrfor.83.b: "They are in no position to bargain."

ukrfor.84.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
ukrfor.84.d: "Ukraine has refused our terms!"
ukrfor.84.a: "Apply the strictest sanction - isolate them!"
ukrfor.84.b: "Declare war and bring back order!"

ukrfor.85.t: "German-Ukrainian Treaty"
ukrfor.85.d: "The German and Ukrainian government, after the round of negotiations, have reached a shaky agreement. Ukraine will stay as a member of Mitteleuropa, while the Germans will receive some concessions."
ukrfor.85.a: "Glory to Ukraine!"

ukrfor.86.t: "German Sanctions!"
ukrfor.86.d: "We were unable to reach an agreement with the Germans, and they have decided to embargo us and economically isolate from the rest of Europe."
ukrfor.86.a: "At least we are free now!"

ukrfor.87.t: "German Declaration of War!"
ukrfor.87.d: "Despite the risk of war on two fronts, the German government has treacherously invaded us in an attempt to 'restore order'. Our government has announced immediate mobilisation and proclaimed the independence of our state."
ukrfor.87.a: "My smilo v bii pidem za Ukrainu!"

ukrfor.88.t: "Ukraine Cut All Ties!"
ukrfor.88.d: "The Ukrainian government has treacherously left our alliance and cut all ties with us. The German Ambassador in Kyiv was literally forced out of the country together with all of other members of Ambassy. If it is not declaration of War, that what is?"
ukrfor.88.a: "Pacify these peasants!"

ukrfor.89.t: "Germany Refused Our Counter-Proposal"
ukrfor.89.d: "The German government has refused to repudiate the Brotfrieden and insists on accepting their terms."
ukrfor.89.a: "Accept them before it's too late."
ukrfor.89.b: "Off with the German yoke!"

ukrfor.90.t: "Our Relations With Germany"
ukrfor.90.d: "With [ROOT.GetRulingParty] securing control over the nation, one of the most important issues have arisen - the relations with the Hegemone, Germany. The basic strategy of the Nationalists in this issue is to have control over any single industry or sphere of Ukraine - be it economy or foreign relations. And while Ukraine has much control over its foreign relations and is rather free in its economy, some issues are still unsolved - namely, the railway, the undisputed access of Germans to our territory and the Brotfrieden. By addressing these issues, we must call for the German ambassador and start negotiations with Germany."
ukrfor.90.a: "We must become competely free of any German influence!"
ukrfor.90.b: "We can negotiate on some economic issues."
ukrfor.90.c: "We have no problem with alliances - we need control over economy."

ukrfor.91.t: "Relations With Nationalist Ukraine"
ukrfor.91.d.harsh: "With the recent tragic events in Ukraine, the new, nationalist governmenth has risen to power with [FROM.GetLeader] as the new 'Vozhd' or Supreme Ruler of nation. Their view on the German-Ukrainian relations are becoming quite clear, as told to our Ambassador in Kyiv: Ukraine demands immediate sovereignty and independence in all questions, including their economy, the Brotfrieden and their foreign alliances.\nWhile this news were met with danger and fear in Berlin, as we are about to lose our most valued ally in the East, we can attempt to negotiate with the new government, ensuring peace. The Abwehr and Intelligence, however, strongly suggest to attack the treacherous Ukrainians in order to restore order and bring back Skoropadskyi or his son back to the throne."
ukrfor.91.d.mediocre: "With the recent tragic events in Ukraine, the new, nationalist governmenth has risen to power with [FROM.GetLeader] as the new 'Vozhd' or Supreme Ruler of nation. Their view on the German-Ukrainian relations are becoming quite clear, as told to our Ambassador in Kyiv: Ukraine demands immediate sovereignty and independence in all questions, including their economy, the Brotfrieden and their foreign alliances.\nThey have however, stated, that they are ready to negotiate with us considering economic issues - as they have no negative attitude to the German investments or activities of German Nationals in Ukraine.\nWhile this news were met with certain anxiety in Berlin, some of our conservative politicians suggest that we should demand better terms - and ensure we have military access to Ukrainian railways and naval access to their ports. The Abwehr and Intelligence, however, strongly suggest to attack the treacherous Ukrainians before they become too strong in order to restore order and bring back Skoropadskyi or his son back to the throne."
ukrfor.91.d: "With the recent tragic events in Ukraine, the new, nationalist governmenth has risen to power with [FROM.GetLeader] as the new 'Vozhd' or Supreme Ruler of nation. Their view on the German-Ukrainian relations are becoming quite clear, as told to our Ambassador in Kyiv: Ukraine demands immediate sovereignty and independence in questions of their economy. Practically, that means that Ukraine is looking forward to repudiating the Brotfrieden and lifting any control of German-owned economic assets in Ukraine - but do not have them nationalized necessarily.\nWhile a large amount of our ministers suggest that their terms are acceptable, the Abwehr and intelligence suggest to immediately strike Ukraine before they become too strong and restore Skoropadskyi or his son to the throne to ensure order and stability on our eastern borders."
ukrfor.91.a: "We need strict guarantees - they are radicals, after all."
ukrfor.91.b: "They are not bloody socialists - perhaps we can show them good will."
ukrfor.91.c: "Who do they think they are, making demands?"

ukrfor.92.t: "German Demands Strict Guarantees"
ukrfor.92.d: "In general, the German Foreign Ministry has refused our demands, to cut the story short. In fact, Germany demands strict guarantees of our neutrality in the Weltkrieg - we are not to join any foreign faction or attack German allies, including Austria. Moreover, we have to give military access to the Reichspakt, our railways and ports, as well as the economic status-quo should pe sustained."
ukrfor.92.a: "We can agree to that, but we demand their guarantees as well."
ukrfor.92.b: "We don't need such a 'treaty' - we are leaving the Pakt!"

ukrfor.93.t: "Germany Sends Their Terms"
ukrfor.93.d: "In general, the German Foreign Ministry has accepted our demands - however, they have demanded access for the Reichspakt members armed forces, as well as port access for the Kaiserliche Marine. Overall, the terms are acceptable, but some of our ministers suggest that we should try to lift the Brotfrieden limits as well."
ukrfor.93.a: "Demand to lift the Brotfrieden."
ukrfor.93.b: "Agree to their terms."

ukrfor.94.t: "Germany Threatens Us!"
ukrfor.94.d: "The German government has refused any of our demands, stating that firstly, our government is not viewed as legitimate by the German state, and secondly, our terms are ridiculous. The Kaiserreich has sent a clear message that they will declare war on us, if we don't concede.\nWhile some members of the government have asked us to refuse such demands and declare formal independence, the others, especially the intelligence suggest another approach - build a secret network of anti-German movememnts among the Reichspakt countries in order to strike Germany when it is too weak."
ukrfor.94.a: "Return their threat. We are leaving the Pakt!"
ukrfor.94.b: "Intelligence knows its job."

ukrfor.95.t: "Ukraine Demands Guarantees!"
ukrfor.95.d: "The Ukrainian nationalist government has agreed to our terms - but they have also asked for something more. They are ready to accept our terms only if our independence is directly guaranteed by Berlin - so in case Russia attacks them, we will have to protect them."
ukrfor.95.b: "They are not in a position to make 'counter-proposals'"
ukrfor.95.a: "They seem reasonable. Also reasonable for our assets."

ukrfor.96.t: "Ukraine Demands Repudiation of the Brotfrieden"
ukrfor.96.d: "The Brotfrieden, or the Bread Peace, once signed in 1918, meaning official recognition of Ukraine by the Central Powers, and re-ratified in 1920 during the Minsk Treaty talks, have ensured regular and fulfilled supplies of Ukrainian foodstuffs and products at a lower price to Germany and Austro-Hungary. At the same time, the Brotfrieden became a shameful stamp for the government and the whole country - and an obstacle to the development of agriculture. Ukraine demands trade at market prices - which means we will lose more supplies at previous prices. A number of politicians, however, believe this would be fair, but the decision is up to the government."
ukrfor.96.a: "They seem reasonable."
ukrfor.96.b: "The costs are too much - reject their proposal."

ukrfor.97.t: "Germany Refused!"
ukrfor.97.d: "Unfortunately, the German government could not agree with us on the terms. It would be wise to accept their previous terms, or, as some radicals suggest, completely ignore them and just proclaim our independence. The intelligence has also a third plan - tell the Germans to forget about everything and preserve status-quo... we must build up secret alliances with the other Eastern European nations and leave the Pakt jointly - just in time when Germany is weak."
ukrfor.97.a: "Accept their previous terms."
ukrfor.97.b: "To hell with Germans. Ukraine shall be free."
ukrfor.97.c: "Intelligence knows its job."

ukrfor.98.t: "Treaty of Dresden"
ukrfor.98.d: "Signed in a quiet city of Dresden, the new treaty between [GER.GetName] and [UKR.GetName] has ended the round of negotations the previous week. With Ukraine officially leaving the Reichspakt, ties between the countries remain - and so Ukraine can now officially be claimed as an independent nation, while Germany will receive certain concessions."
ukrfor.98.a: "Toast to peace in Europe!"

ukrfor.99.t: "Ukraine Proclaims Independence!"
ukrfor.99.d: "Despite being formally independent, the Ukrainians have now once again declared their independence. With a passionate speech in Kyiv, [UKR.GetLeader] has announced that Ukraine is now standing free and proud, closing its borders with the rest of the Reichspakt, as well as ending the hateful Brotfrieden in order to guide its economy freely and trading freely with the countries of the world. The Ukrainian nationalist war machine and propaganda has already crossed all reasonable limits and is spreading to the neighboring countries who watch with envy on 'Free Ukraine'"
ukrfor.99.a: "This crypto-syndicalist national disaster shall end."

ukrfor.100.t: "Normalisation of German-Ukrainian Relations"
ukrfor.100.d: "The news of the overthrow of former Ukrainian government was received in Berlin with worry and mistrust. As the situation stabilised, it became clear that a full-blown syndicalist takeover was avoided. The last shots of the uprising has just fired and Ukraine is now fully controlled by the Socialist 'Dyrektoria' or Directorate of the Ukrainian People's Republic. As our minister of foreign affairs has said - who controls Ukraine, controls the Eastern Europe.\n\nThe new Ukrainian government has jeopardised the sphere of influence in Eastern Europe that we have spent twenty years carefully constructing. Many hotheads in the Abwehr have suggesed direct military action to punish the new socialist government and deter other potential insurrectionists. Doing so could be extremely unwise however as Ukraine possesses one of the largest armed forces in Europe and they are critical for our long-term plans as a bulwark against a belligerent Russia. However, some politicians, especially from the SPD have suggested to negotiate concessions with the new government in Kyiv, perhaps we can escape further bloodshed - though making too many concessions would be unpopular at home and in other parts of Mitteleuropa."
ukrfor.100.a: "We need strict guarantees - they are radicals, after all." # -> 103
ukrfor.100.b: "Let's start with some good will." # -> 102
ukrfor.100.c: "Crush the Socialist traitors!"

ukrfor.101.t: "Berlin Withdraws From Ukraine!"
ukrfor.101.d: "Following our withdrawal from the Reichspakt bloc, the German military mission present in our country since 1918 has finally fully left! Already, officers and advisers that had been stationed on the Ostwall, in Sevastopil and the capital Kyiv, have been surreptitiously evacuated over the course of the day. This is truly a testament to an independent Ukraine.\nMoreover, the German industry and business has also left, which meant immediate nationalization of their resources."
ukrfor.101.a: "The chains are broken, for now at least."

ukrfor.102.t: "German Demands: Economic Status Quo"
ukrfor.102.d: "The starting point of the negotiations has been surprisingly conciliatory. Berlin requires us to remain a Mitteleuropa member, with all the same treaties in place as before - which admittedly were one of the better things the Skoropadskyi administration had negotiated. However, this includes granting German businesses equal rights to Ukrainian ones, and assuring that they won't be nationalised nor harassed in any other way. Still, it is a way better deal than some had feared."
ukrfor.102.a: "Aim for a better deal."
ukrfor.102.b: "Better than expected."

ukrfor.103.t: "German Demands: Strict Safeguards"
ukrfor.103.d: "As a government propelled into power by a revolution, the German delegation explained, we cannot return to the same level of trust that once existed between our two governments. Thus, Berlin requires safeguards. Not only we are to return to Mitteleuropa, we also need to safeguard German property and capital in Ukraine and grant preferential treatment in trade to the German Empire. In addition, the Germans require control over the main railway lines across the country, to ensure the \"national security\" of Ukraine. Even though officially this is to ensure fast troop deployment against Russia, in truth it is also to keep pressure on the Ukrainian \"radical\" regime."
ukrfor.103.a: "These are terrible, send our best diplomats to Berlin."
ukrfor.103.b: "Better sign it..."

ukrfor.104.t: "Ukrainian Counter-Proposal"
ukrfor.104.d: "Unsatisfied with our demands, the Ukrainian delegation has arrived to haggle. They wish to change some particularly troublesome points of our agreement, such as being permitted to nationalise German-owned assets, though by paying full compensation for them. They additionally wish to avoid a too high German presence in the country and, for additional liberties, offer us more profitable export arrangements. This is obviously more important to them domestically, as they do not wish to be seen as \"selling the country to the Germans\" - the same crime they accused the Hetman's government of."
ukrfor.104.a: "Seems reasonable."
ukrfor.104.b: "They are in no position to bargain."

ukrfor.105.t: "Germans Accept Our Deal"
ukrfor.105.d: "Our delegation managed to convince Germany to lower their unreasonable demands. It is an achievement that we can sell to our domestic supporters as victory over German hegemony, or at least progress towards our eventual liberation - something that the Hetmanate never managed to achieve. As a major part of the renegotiation, the Germans dropped their demand of controlling the railway and manning them with their own soldiers, and were satisfied with the establishment of a joint committee to manage and organise the infrastructure system."
ukrfor.105.a: "Great that they saw reason."
ukrfor.105.b: "This isn't enough, perhaps we have friends in Vienna..."
ukrfor.105.c: "These terms are unacceptable!" # -> 116

ukrfor.106.t: "Germany Ignored Our Counter-Proposal!"
ukrfor.106.d: "Our negotiators did not manage to gain any real changes. The Germans gave us some token concessions, but they were mere breadcrumbs to make it look like Germans were being reasonable and not just forcing us to sign their ultimatum. If we sign it, it's not going to look very good at home - at this point, only real way to improve our situation would be backing of another major power."
ukrfor.106.a: "Let's see if we have friends in Vienna..."
ukrfor.106.b: "At least we tried."
ukrfor.106.c: "These terms are unacceptable!" # -> 116

ukrfor.107.t: "Ukrainian Railways Return Under German Control"
ukrfor.107.d: "As per the agreement with the new Ukrainian government, the main arteries of their infrastructure system have been sold to a German state company, and put under their administration. In practice this means a lasting German grip over Ukraine, with the Heer having free movement through the country - and Germany reaping financial profits from the system. It's a national humiliation for [UKR.GetNameDef], but Berlin's leadership can rest easy, having reaffirmed their grip on the east."
ukrfor.107.a: "Splendid."
ukrfor.107.b: "Necessary sacrifice."

ukrfor.108.t: "Ukraine Seeks Protection"
ukrfor.108.d: "In secret talks with the Ukrainian ambassador in Vienna, the possibility of an official alliance between [202.GetName] and Vienna was raised for the first time. The negotiations between Ukraine and Germany seem to have hit a stalemate, with the Ukrainians being unwilling to accept all the various unreasonable demands that the Germans are making. To escape this plight, they have suggested an alliance between the Habsburg Empire and Ukraine, reducing their dependence on Germans for protection and giving them a better hand for negotiation. This will no doubt annoy the Germans greatly... but on the other hand, they did rob us of this possibility already in 1917. This time we shouldn't let the Ukrainians down."
ukrfor.108.a: "They are welcome."
ukrfor.108.b: "They just want us to get into another foolish war."

ukrfor.109.t: "The Austro-German-Ukrainian Treaty"
ukrfor.109.d: "After it became clear that a German-Ukrainian treaty was impossible, the three powers started a new round of negotiations. A compromise was as the Austrians sought to balance the equation for their own gain; Ukraine would be military allied to Austria, but remain in Mitteleuropa. However, the economic part is much more complex, going through everything from foreign citizens' rights to conduct business in Ukraine on equal ground to the locals to clauses protecting foreign-owned factories and mines from being nationalised or harassed in other ways. The conditions are way milder than those that the Germans initially demanded."
ukrfor.109.a: "A return to stability, hopefully."
ukrfor.109.b: "Whatever."
ukrfor.109.c: "Wonderful!"

ukrfor.110.t: "The German-Ukrainian Treaty"
ukrfor.110.d: "After intense negotiations, the two powers reached a shaky agreement. The Ukrainian People's Republic will continue being militarily allied to Germany, and will host German troops in the country. However, the economic part is much more complex, going through everything from foreign citizens' rights to conduct business in Ukraine on equal ground to the locals to clauses protecting foreign-owned factories and mines from being nationalised or harassed in other ways. All this has kept the German industry's faith in Ukraine as a desirable location of investment but will no doubt become a troublesome thorn in the republic's side."
ukrfor.110.a: "A return to normalcy, hopefully."

ukrfor.111.t: "Fate of Skoropadskyi"
ukrfor.111.d: "The tables have turned. The former Hetman and his cronies escaped to Berlin before justice could catch them and are now organising the \"Ukrainian National Government\" in exile. They have petitioned the Kaiser to support them, though with poor results thus far. It's hard to believe that Skoropadskyi could be much of a threat to us anymore - but then again, he is guilty of countless crimes against the Ukrainian people and should face trial. We could request Germany to extradite him, though this might put the German government in an awkward position."
ukrfor.111.a: "Make the demand."
ukrfor.111.b: "His fate is no longer a concern of ours."

ukrfor.112.t: "Extradition Request of Pavlo Skoropadskyi"
ukrfor.112.d: "Pavlo Skoropadskyi, the former Ukrainian Hetman, has sought refuge in Berlin alongside what remains of his government. A new republican government sits in [202.GetName], and Skoropadskyi has been petitioning us to start military intervention to restore \"legal rule\" to Ukraine. It is entirely out of the question - the republican regime is willing to negotiate, and intervening at this point would mean open war with Ukraine, an event that the Russians would welcome with open arms.\n\nWe hoped to ignore Skoropadskyi entirely, but now the Ukrainian government has officially requested the extradition of the former Hetman to bring him to Ukraine to answer for his crimes. On the one hand, he is useless to us; extraditing him could be used as a token of goodwill towards Ukraine... but Skoropadskyi still has allies in Germany, and it would look embarrassing if a candidate we supported for two decades were tried as a war criminal."
ukrfor.112.a: "Send him to Ukraine."
ukrfor.112.b: "Refuse it."

ukrfor.113.t: "Germany Accepts the Extradition request"
ukrfor.113.d: "The German government has agreed, and Skoropadskyi has been arrested and accused of various high crimes. He will be sent to Ukraine shortly to stand for a trial and answer to the Ukrainian people for his deeds."
ukrfor.113.a: "Let us prepare the charges."

ukrfor.114.t: "Skoropadskyi Will Stay in Germany"
ukrfor.114.d: "In a polite answer from Berlin, they informed us that Pavlo Skoropadskyi has been granted asylum in Germany and as long as he has not committed crimes in Germany, he shall not be deported. In private, the German ambassador hinted that further prying on the matter would greatly displease Berlin, and recommended to let it be forgotten."
ukrfor.114.a: "The tyrant has escaped."

ukrfor.115.t: "Trial of the Hetman"
ukrfor.115.d: "The number of charges is enormous - ordering murders, torture, and imprisonment of peasants and workers of Ukraine from 1919, two decades of oppressive measures, and ordering mass executions during the Ukrainian Revolution of 1936. The well-prepared list of charges was politically motivated but genuine: blood was on the Hetman's hands. In Skoropadskyi's defence, he argued that everything he did was to protect the legal order of Ukraine and its democracy. In a surprisingly emotional speech, he assured that he has only ever had the welfare of all Ukrainians in his mind and that the charges - some of which he admits to being true and necessary - are a mere sham, as they were not illegal when they were committed, and have been unconstitutionally declared only after the fact.\n\nIn the end, he is still guilty - the only question is the punishment."
ukrfor.115.a: "He is a traitor and deserves to rot in prison."
ukrfor.115.b: "Show the poor man leniency he never showed to us."

ukrfor.116.t: "Ukraine Refused!"
ukrfor.116.d: "The new Ukrainian government has refused any further cooperation with us! They have stated that we should respect the will of the Ukrainian people and their sovereignty. Although this is just a fairy tale for Ukrainians, the empire cannot leave such impudence unanswered."
ukrfor.116.a: "Apply strictest sanctions!"
ukrfor.116.b: "Abwehr was right - declare war on these peasants!"

With success of German offensive, their forces have entered our capital, marching on the streets, imposing curfew and martial law and already assigning a General-Governor to rule our city.

Our highest naval admiralty is convinced that it would be an absolutely shortsighted decision to transfer the fleet back to the Ukrainians. The military leadership is of a similar opinion, but it is ready to make concessions and give the Ukrainians only half of their fleet. On the other hand, a number of politicians believe that it is not worth spoiling relations with Europe's new breadbasket and it is necessary to return the entire fleet to the new government to gain its favor, and in return demand only the right to use the docks and naval bases in Odesa, Mykolaiv and Berdianske."

ukrfor.141.t: "Economic Negotiations With Ukraine"
ukrfor.141.d: "There was a suggestion from our friendly Ukraine that we immediately raise import tariffs, a measure we took at the dawn of Black Monday to stabilize the economic situation and which led Ukraine itself into an agricultural crisis and almost collapse. \n\nThe proposal, however, is more in the form of demands and clearly tests our government's loyalty to the Ukrainian regime. Despite the fact that this state has an exceptional role in our alliance and the stability of the supply and food supply for our large army, economists calculate that the decision to raise tariffs could harm our not yet fully established economy."

ukrfor.149.d: "As a result of our threats, the German command decided that it is not safe for them and the Reichspakt to keep our state as independent as we are now. With this in mind, the German forces have crossed the borders of Ukraine today, rapidly capturing key military bases and cities. Finally, they have arrived in Kyiv, where the defence was set by Hetman to protect the city, but fortunately, no blood was spilled. The Germans have quickly occupied the city and put the Hetman under house arrest, until further notice."
ukrfor.149.a: "What is happening?!"

ukrfor.150.t: "Fate of the Hetmanate"
ukrfor.150.d: "As the Hetman of Ukraine was put under house arrest, the question has arisen what to do with this failed state of Ukraine. The German Abwehr and the Heer command has suggested to place instead Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, the Hetman's general usher and head of the Chancellery. Despite his loyalty to the Hetmanate, he has no Russophile sentiments as is known for his ties with the Reichspakt command. A Cossack, who will be loyal to Germany.\n\nHowever, some other members of the government, from the conservative parties, have suggested something more radical - place the Kaiser himself on a throne, establishing the personal union with Ukraine and keeping it under our direct control."

ukrfor.151.a: "Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia is a better choice, obviously."
ukrfor.151.b: "We'd be proud if our Kaiser was [GER.GetLeader]!"

ukrfor.152.d: "As the decision of the German command has been discussed, Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia has been chosen as the main candidate for the Hetmanship. With the forced abdication of Pavlo Skoropadskyi, his once most loyal Chancellor has now risen to power as the Hetman."
ukrfor.152.a: "Interesting."

ukrfor.153.t: "Personal Union with Germany"
ukrfor.153.d: "As the decision of the German command has been thoroughly discussed, in a surprising turn of events, the Germans have decided to fully control our nation, as the plan to crown Kaiser [GER.GetLeader] as Ukrainian Hetman, establishing a personal union of German-Ukraine."
ukrfor.153.a: "Are they serious?!"

ukrfor.154.t: "Hetman [ROOT.GetLeader] Passes Away!"
ukrfor.154.d: "The tragic news have reached Kyiv, as our Monarch, Hetman Vasyl II, better known as Kaiser Wilhelm II, has passed away. As the nation mourns, his son, Wilhelm III has become the new German Emperor, simultaneously becoming the Hetman of Ukraine under the name of Vasyl III."
ukrfor.154.a: "The Hetman is dead, Long live the Hetman!"

ukrfor.155.t: "Secret Talks With Kyiv"
ukrfor.155.d: "Through secret underground channels the high-ranking Ukrainian agent has initiated talks with our government about the future of Ukraine. Telling that he's acting on behalf of the Hetman himself, Ukraine suggests a secret pact with us, as the war is becoming inevitable. He suggests to negotiate a non-aggression pact and an alliance between Russia and Ukraine. As Russia embarks on its journey to liberate the Eastern Europe from German yoke, Ukraine is promising to stay neutral in the conflict as none Ukrainian soldier will cross the border with us.\n\nWhile this proposal is very benefitial for us, some certain nationalists in the government believe that we should not 'play in diplomacy' and refuse this treacherous alliance. However, the majority in the government believe that Hetman is or was, after all, a Russophile. This will further delay the solution to the 'Ukrainian question', but at least we will be able to secure most of our forces on the other frontlines."
ukrfor.155.a: "Approve of this plan."
ukrfor.155.b: "Reject this madness!"

ukrfor.156.t: "Russia Accepts!"
ukrfor.156.d: "The Russian government made it clear to us, that they will stay out of Ukraine as long as we promise to not attack them. As Russian troops will enter the other Eastern European countries, we will officially leave the Reichspakt and declare our independence, which Russia is ready to guarantee."
ukrfor.156.a: "Splendid!"

ukrfor.157.t: "Russia Refused!"

### Romania Claims ###
ukrfor.223.t: "Customs War With Romania"
ukrfor.223.d: "In 1918, both Romania and Ukraine claimed the territory of Bessarabia, which, for certain reasons, could not fully defend its causes. Both Romania and the Ukrainian authorities denied Bessarabia the right to democratically and independently determine its future fate. Sfatul Țării, the unrecognized government of the so-called Moldovan Democratic Republic, eventually, under the occupation of Bessarabia by the Romanian forces, attempted to become part of Romania, but this decision was recognized by neither Russia nor Ukraine. Only the Minsk Treaty of 1920 between Germany and Russia, in which Ukraine also participated, set the official border with Romania along the Dniester River\n\nNevertheless, for many years the official position of the Ukrainian authorities and the government of Skoropadskyi was that Bessarabia should become part of Ukraine on the rights of autonomy. In general, an understanding with Romania could not be found and, as a result, a customs war began, that is, economic sanctions, which led to the fact that for almost two decades, Romania and Ukraine have not had any trade relations.\n\nNow the situation is as follows. The Ukrainian government intends to send an ultimatum to Romania about the immediate withdrawal of troops from Bessarabia (or part of it) in exchange for the end of the trade war. If the Ukrainian goals of freeing the Ukrainians from the shackles of Romanianization can be achieved, this will undoubtedly be a victory for the Ukrainian national movement in Bessarabia."

It became a powerful manifestation of the will of Ukrainians for ethnic and territorial consolidation, evidence of their dynamic self-identification and the formation of the nation.\n\nThe Akt Zluki finally gave a complete form to the independent Ukrainian state and contributed to overcoming the rudiments of federalism in the mentality of the national political elite of the two countries. [UKR.GetLeader] also expressed the hope that the Unification would become a model of a civilized, democratic, non-exploitative assembly of territories in a single sovereign state."

Not only have the Romanians held off the brunt of the initial assault, but they have also managed to repel us for quite some time by now! If this embarrassment continues, our military machine will become the laughingstock of the world!

ukrfor.240.d: "The borderlands between Slovaks, Hungarians and Poles have long been a motherland for an ethnic minority of Lemkos, who have their language and culture suppressed. The East Lemkos have long been Russophiles and willing to join the Greater Russian Empire, but with its collapse, their sentiments were towards Ukraine. Unfortunately, they've never had any serious political representation, but now we are here to decide if we want to save Lemkos, same as saved Hutsuls and other small Ukrainian minorities.\n\nThe other question that arises is that of the West Lemkos, who are more tied to Poland culturally and believe that they are mostly a subgroup of Poles. While this is not exactly true and they are the same Lemkos as their Eastern brethren, we have to decide if are to liberate them as well."
ukrfor.240.a: "Better not to touch these borderlands."

ukrfor.252.d: "Ukraine has been turbulent of late. The political crisis that erupted after the September events led to a large-scale outbreak of anti-monarchist forces that succeeded in overthrowing the government and announcing the return of the Ukrainian People's Republic. However, the socialist government was unable to effectively organize the new government, as a result of which Otaman Symon Petliura, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, seized power in the country.\n\nBut this was not the end of the series of misfortunes. The peasants and workers in the South and Southeast, led by radical leftists, revolted against Othoman. That would be all right, but Ukraine is an important region that provides food and labor for all of Europe.\n\nWhoever owns Ukraine owns all of Eastern Europe. "

However, he is mistaken in thinking that Ukraine will surrender Kyiv to the German forces. \n\nOtaman Petliura ordered all combat-ready units to immediately rush to defend the borders of our republic. However, this decision could be dangerous, since the Borotbysts hold power in the south. It may be worth offering them a temporary alliance to save Ukraine, otherwise the Ukrainian people will once again find themselves in slavery and on the verge of physical annihilation."
ukrfor.253.d.RUS: "Taking advantage of our weakness and blatantly violating the Minsk Peace, Russian army troops treacherously attacked Ukraine! Justifying their aggression by protection of the Russian-speaking population, they only bring the world closer to a new world war and chaos. We will not surrender Ukraine to them and we must fight them back vigorously."
ukrfor.253.d.POL: "The Poles have long been greedy for our land. Appealing to the borders of the Rzeczpospolita, the long-time dream of Polish nationalists was to regain control of the land of Right-Bank Ukraine. Now we must repel Poland's treacherous attack in order to retain our territories."
ukrfor.253.d.WHR: "The traitorous position of Belarus on the solution of territorial conflicts by force will bring them down! Yesterday, the government of Belarus, under the aegis of protecting the Belarussian population, treacherously attacked our northern borders. Their aggression will not go unchecked and sooner or later we will get our legitimate territories back!"
ukrfor.253.d.ROM: "The Romanian government launched a large-scale attack on our territory without a declaration of war. Practically in a few hours they captured major population centers and reached the Dniester River, including the capture of Odesa.

ukrfor.260.d: "Amidst all-out aggression and an attempt to divide Ukraine, the counter-revolutionary government of Otaman Petliura asked us to conclude a temporary truce and alliance against the enemies of Ukraine.

Instead of vehemently opposing European cooperation like the stubborn radicals do, we should instead aim to cooperate with other like-minded states in Eastern Europe. After all, social reformist and democratic governments have risen into power in many of our like-minded nations.\n\nThere were already preliminary talks about deeper cooperation between our states in the last summer's Mitteleuropa Conference, and now the proposal has become an actual treaty, mostly based on a draft by Polish statesman Gabriel Narutowicz. This Treaty of Cooperation Between People's States, dubbed by the press as \"The Little Pact\", would form our own economic area inside Mitteleuropa, which would pool together our influence in the organisation on one hand, and coordinate joint infrastructure and development projects on the other hand. Ideally our cooperation would serve as an example of non-exploitatory relations between neighbours, and serve as a counterbalance to German and Austrian interests."

While the organisation is at its infancy and mostly deals in joint infrastructural projects in our shared border regions, there are many ideas to eventually expand the treaty into a larger economic union. Hopefully this will give us additional diplomatic leverage in future trade negotiations with Germany."

ukrfor.649.t: "Formation of Treaty of Cooperation Between People's States"
ukrfor.649.d: "The foreign ministers of Poland, Ukraine and White Ruthenia have signed the Treaty of Cooperation Between People's States today. In their joint statement, the agreement is meant to coordinate their infrastructure projects and other economic cooperation. We were informed of this in advance, and the foreign ministry did not see reason to stop these designs - at least after we received number of exceptions and stiplations in the treaty text ensuring that our own economic influence is not hurt by this. In practice, this treaty means little. In best case, it might improve economic stability of the Eastern Mitteleuropa, and at worst it will collapse in year or two due to internal bickering."

We and our Eastern European brothers have fought valiantly, but it is only a matter of time when we are crushed one by one. The only way we might be able to survive is by rallying together what's left of our allies, united by our belief in people's democracy and liberty. "

Both conservatives and socialists currently oppose the Bill and have suggested their amendements, but we have to choose the side this time.\n\nWhile the Conservatives consider that the Bill is too 'syndicalist', the Socialists believe it to be too 'Reactionary'. Therefore, the KSM has suggested to restrict taxation on farmers and any cooperatives between the independent smallholders.

However, there are different approaches for the reform: the first variant is suggested jointly by SPM and MSDP/MPS and is aimed to introduce a single public health programme for all member countries. It is meant to prevent diseases and threats to health, as well as to promote research and define compulsory health policies. This approach is not shared by the LDPM and KSM. Instead, they suggest that the health policies should not be defined, nor the organisation and provision of health services and medical care. Instead, the policy should serve to complement national policies and to support cooperation between member countries in the field of public health."

In fact, he is not an actual leader of any political force. He was exiled by Hetman a few years ago to Kuban, where he teaches in university, away from political life of Ukraine. Nevertheless, now without any more possible allies, perhaps it is high time for Hetman to turn to Mikhnovskyi and offer him a seat in the government."

UKR_Outlaw_Radicalism_desc: "With the explosion on the Dnieper, a wave of political repression begins in the kingdom. From Skoropadskyi’s point of view - a fair trial for all those involved. Of course, their guilt will be established by the court, but who says that the evidence will not be enough?"
## Interlude focuses ##
UKR_Regency_Council: "The Triumphant Conclusion"
UKR_Regency_Council_desc: "The first reforms are over, and the time has come to determine the future of the executive power in the absence of the King. Ukraine is to become the Hetmanate under full authority of Hetman Skoropadskyi"
UKR_Hetman_Of_All_Ukraine: "Hetman of All Ukraine"

UKR_Grey_Eminence: "Rise of the Grey Eminence"
UKR_Grey_Eminence_desc: "During the recent months, Mykola Mikhnovskyi has risen from the exiled freak into the Grey Eminence of the Hetman's cabinet as its Minister of Interior. It happened so that despite all odds Skoropadskyi has chosen Mikhnovskyi to lead the new government, and now the decisions of 'Father of Samostiynist' will affect the whole country."
UKR_Federalisation: "Decentralization Under Supervision"
UKR_Federalisation_desc: "The Socialists, Nationalists and the Russophiles have all tried to impose their ideas on the whole country. This has demonstrated the flaws of the centralised approach of the Hetmanate. If we give our regions more autonomy and weaken the Soim, we will be able to stop regional debates becoming flashpoints on the national stage to ensure political chaos remains a thing of the past."
UKR_Peasant_State: "The Peasant State"
UKR_Peasant_State_desc: "Our peasants have always played a significant role in the country and its economy.

UKR_Smallholding_Aspiration_desc: "The smallholders, our Khliborobs and farmers should not feel threatened in our new state. In the tradition of Mikhnovskyi’s old UDKhP party we shall focus on the smallholders and greatly increase state support of them."
UKR_Change_Ethnic_Borders: "Change the Ethnic Borders"
UKR_Change_Ethnic_Borders_desc: "The ideal of Nation-State must be accomplished by creating a monoethnic national Ukrainian state - our political borders shall definitely match the ethnic ones - otherwise our people won't be free."

UKR_From_Carpathians_To_Caucasus_desc: "As outlined in the 10 Commandments of the Ukrainian People's Party - Mikhnovskyi’s early organisation, the Ukraine shall stay united and undivided, independent and free - from Carpathians and to the Caucasus"
UKR_Nationalist_Army_Clique: "Draw Over the Army Nationalist Clique"
UKR_Nationalist_Army_Clique_desc: "The nationalist clique in the army - mainly, the UVO and its associates are our natural allies in the struggle for Ukrainian Sovereignty. We must make sure that they are on our side."

UKR_Exposure_Of_The_Russophile_Plot: "Exposure of the Russophile Plot"
UKR_Exposure_Of_The_Russophile_Plot_desc: "The Russophiles have captured the Hetman's state apparatus, the Protofis exploits our Ukrainian workers and the VSZV landowners deprive Ukrainian peasants of their legal rights. This nightmare shall stop and the Otaman-Minister knows exactly what to do."

# Hetmanate Faction #
UKR_Palm_Of_MC: "Palm of the Gentleman Usher"
UKR_Palm_Of_MC_desc: "Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia, a Cossack enthusiast and Hetman's chancellery general clerk is the main proponent of the Hetmanate traditions. Being supporter of Vilne Kozatstvo movement he did much to revive the traditions of the past, but Hetman always prefered a different approach. However, now the 'Gentleman Usher' of the Pan Hetman's court became his right hand and the Otaman-Minister and changes await the Ukrainian State."
UKR_Legacy_Of_First_Hetmanate: "Legacy of the First Hetmanate"
UKR_Legacy_Of_First_Hetmanate_desc: "The term of the First Hetmanate appeared soon after Skoropadskyi was proclaimed the Hetman in 1918, turning Ukraine into the 'Second Hetmanate'. The First Hetmanate, existing in 1649-1764, was established during Khmelnystkyi’s Uprising, effectively becoming a Russian protectorate and vassal state later to be disbanded and directly annexed into the Empire. The first truly national Ukrainian state was a great success of the Ukrainian national movement and its traditions should be revived and its legacy honored."
UKR_Cossack_Class: "Magnify the Cossack Class"
UKR_Cossack_Class_desc: "The Cossack Class in Ukraine was destroyed by the treacherous actions of the Russian Tsars, but with the revival of the Ukrainian State it has been restored.

UKR_Militarization_Of_State: "Militarization of Bureacracy"
UKR_Militarization_Of_State_desc: "The bureaucratic apparatus consisted solely of civilian officials, corrupt by money and power. The disciplined Cossack class shall take the reigns of bureaucracy instead - in order to effectively rule the new Hetmanate."
UKR_Convene_General_Rada: "Convene the General Rada"
UKR_Convene_General_Rada_desc: "The game of democracy or authoritarianism, initiated by the German's will have become too dangerous for our Cossack State. Instead of Soim, the General Rada should be established - a special legislative institution, headed by Hetman (if not elected), Cossacks, Orthodox Church representatives and representatives of the Cities. This will allow us to concentrate power not only in the hands of military men, but also share it with the civilians to a certain degree."
UKR_Urban_Autonomy: "Enshrine Cities' Magdeburg Rights"
UKR_Urban_Autonomy_desc: "Since ancient times such cities as Kyiv, Chernihiv, Starodub, Poltava and the others had Magdeburg Rights which allowed them to develop and be independent from Feudals. We should continue this centuries-long legacy that allowed our cities to prosper. The younger cities, especially in the Southern and South-Eastern Ukraine should be granted greater urban autonomies."
UKR_Military_Administration: "Adopt the Cossack Administrative Division"
UKR_Military_Administration_desc: "The Hetmanate's administrative division was based on regiments that were dislocated within it and it proved to be a succesful means of managing the territories. We should get rid of Tsarist administrative division and base it on the dislocation of our revived Cossack divisions."
UKR_Connections_To_UVO: "Connections With UVO"
UKR_Connections_To_UVO_desc: "The doctrine of Integral Nationalism is quite attractive for the future of Ukrainian Cossack Nationalism and we must establish good ties with the UVO, the main proponents of this ideology."

UKR_Cossack_Hetmanate_desc: "All the necessary reforms have been implemented and now Ukraine is truly becoming a Hetmanate, similar to the ones that existed centuries ago."

UKR_Line_Of_Succession: "Secure the Line of Succession"
UKR_Line_Of_Succession_desc: "Before 1927 several attempts to establish a hereditary Hetmanate were opposed by the Germans and Austro-Hungarians, as well as the USKhD opposition to the Hetman. Now nothing can stop us from securing the House of Skoropadskyi as rulers of Ukraine."
UKR_Lead_The_Hetman_Movement: "Lead the Hetmanist Movement"
UKR_Lead_The_Hetman_Movement_desc: "Over the last decades the Hetmanist movement has grown too diverse: we must unite all of Hetmanists into the Hetman's own SHD."
UKR_Pardon_Monarchists: "Pardon the USKhD"
UKR_Pardon_Monarchists_desc: "Under Viacheslav Lypynskyi, the USKhD has become dangerous for Hetman, but now the King is gone and there's nobody they can support instead of our Hetman. We must pardon them and make contacts with loyal Agrarian-Statists."
UKR_Reconcile_With_Lypynskyi: "Reconcile With Lypynskyi"
UKR_Reconcile_With_Lypynskyi_desc: "Viacheslav Lypynskyi was a long friend of the Hetman, but they could not find a compromise, considering Hetman's own powers. By 'softening' the grip over Ukraine, we can reconcile with our ally and reunite the Hetmanists."
UKR_Chair_To_Doroshenko: "Chair to Doroshenko"
UKR_Chair_To_Doroshenko_desc: "Dmytro Doroshenko, a long-time supporter of the Hetman himself and the SHD, is leading a liberal party of the UPSF(m). As part of our effort to unite the Hetmanist movement, we shall primarily focus on his democratic foundation, rather than on elitist Lypynskyi’s classocrats."
UKR_Expand_Membership_Of_The_Union: "Expand Membership of the Union"
UKR_Expand_Membership_Of_The_Union_desc: "We should not find allies among our past friends - we must give up any idea to reconcile with those who opposed us. Instead, we must look for new cadres and make the SHD a popular organisation and attract much of Khliborobs into our organisation at the local level."
UKR_Retain_Absolutism: "Retain Absolutism"
UKR_Retain_Absolutism_desc: "The Absolute rule of Hetman is absolutely necessary in the current circumstances. Without strong grip over the nation we won't succeed."
UKR_Further_Centralisation: "Further Centralisation"
UKR_Further_Centralisation_desc: "Any decentralisation or even more radical federalisation will only lead to the loss of the Pan Hetman's power. Instead, we need centralise the state even further and make sure we control every local Rada."

UKR_The_Month_Constitution: "Adopt the [GetMonth] Constitution"
UKR_The_Month_Constitution_desc: "With the first steps taken, the revised Constitution should be adopted, that will secure the current state of affairs and our rule over the Hetmanate."

# Russophile faction #
UKR_Mastery_Of_The_Old_Aristocracy: "Mastery of the Old Bureacracy"
UKR_Mastery_Of_The_Old_Aristocracy_desc: "The Old Tsarist Bureacracy, surrounding Hetman have proved to be reliable allies in the suppression of opposite-minded bureaucrats and officials."
UKR_Threaten_Germany: "Rethinking Mitteleuropan Cooperation"
UKR_Threaten_Germany_desc: "Enough to be satisfied with the German hosts. We are an independent country and we will dictate terms to Germany ourselves, if they want to receive stable grain from us."
UKR_Threaten_Germany_note: "§RIf we try to ally Russia, Mikhnovskyi and his loyalists will coup Hetman!§!"
UKR_Legacy_Of_Imperial_Russia: "Legacy of Imperial Russia"
UKR_Legacy_Of_Imperial_Russia_desc: "The order of pre-revolutionary Russia remained fairly common in Ukraine, but with the advent of the Austrian king, an increasingly pro-Western way of life and lifestyle was adopted. Skoropadskyi believes that the tsarist regime brought many good things and that the old orders should be restored"
UKR_Look_Out_To_Russia: "Eyes to the East"
UKR_Look_Out_To_Russia_desc: "With the collapse of the German economy, perhaps we should look eastward to Russia, which is rising from the ashes. The Russophile wing of the SHD particularly insists on this"

UKR_Support_The_Protofis: "Support the Protofis"
UKR_Support_The_Protofis_desc: "The Protofis, or organization of large industrialists, needed the support of the Hetman to counterbalance the large German capital that dominated Ukraine"
UKR_Well_Deserved_Compensation: "Well Deserved Compensation"
UKR_Well_Deserved_Compensation_desc: "Thanks to the loyalty of the Protofis and the VSZV, we can finally reward them with various subsidies, grants or just close eyes on some of corrupt deeds they make. After all, what can we do without our loyal oligarchs?"
UKR_well_deserved_compensation_tt: "§CLand reform decisions will now finish 30 days quicker.§!"
UKR_Favour_Loyal_Landowners: "Favour Loyal Landowners"
UKR_Favour_Loyal_Landowners_desc: "Similarly to Tsarist Russia, a new aristocracy was forming in our country - from among the large landowners and industrialists. They are one of the pillars of our regime and it is necessary to ascertain their loyalty to Skoropadskyi."
UKR_favour_loyal_landowners_tt: "Beware, as overall §Oland reform§! increases, the §Cstability§! that can be gained increases while reducing the immediate bonus to §Oland reform.§!"
 
# Shared #
UKR_Restore_Vilne_Kozatstvo: "Fund the Vilne Kozatstvo"
UKR_Restore_Vilne_Kozatstvo_desc: "The Vilne Kozatstvo or the Free Cossacks emerged as civil defense detachments and territorial paramilitary formations defending the independence of Ukraine. In accordance with the demand of the German occupation command, in April 1918, the Hetman had to disarm the Free Cossacks. However, as Skoropadskyi has started to rebuild the Ukrainian army almost from scratch, the Free Cossacks once again appeared, this time under great influence of the Hetman himself, and Ivan Poltavets-Ostrianytsia. The movement needs additional funds, for it is the essence of our power!"
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy: "Ukrainian Unity" 
UKR_Skoropadsky_Policy_desc: "The relations between the Russians and the Ukrainians in Ukraine are good enough, but various powers try to depict them as an eternal struggle between the West and the East. We must stop this chauvinistic propaganda, but our aim is also to show that despite the common past and good relations with Russia, we are independent now and will always be."
UKR_End_The_Martial_Law: "End the Martial Law"
UKR_End_The_Martial_Law_desc: "The state of emergency imposed by Hetman is coming to an end. For now, this does not mean the return of the Sejm, nor does it affect the state of affairs in the country, except for a sense of some calm and stability"
UKR_End_The_Martial_Law_tt: "Beware, if §Oland reform§! is active, the §RBorotbyst Resistance§! will be strengthened."
UKR_Revive_Ukrainisation: "Revive Ukrainisation"
UKR_Revive_Ukrainisation_desc: "In recent years the pace of Ukrainianization has slowed down a bit, but our state needs the growth of national consciousness, the development of Ukrainian culture and science. It is necessary to take measures to actualize the Ukrainian national movement."
UKR_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy: "Bureaucratic Overhaul"
UKR_Restructure_The_Bureaucracy_desc: "The bureaucratic apparatus, thanks to the efforts of Soim and Korol, became essentially their main stronghold in the regions. They still remain in place, hindering Skoropadskyi’s effective policies. It is necessary to replace them with loyal subalterns and to establish contact between the regions and the central government"
UKR_Invest_In_Industry: "Gears of Industry"
UKR_Invest_In_Industry_desc: "The industrial development of Ukraine is a matter of existential importance. Without industrialization we will not be able to withstand any army."
UKR_New_German_Contracts: "New German Contracts"
UKR_New_German_Contracts_desc: "Without German support, we are powerless. It is necessary to conclude new contracts with large German companies and make them invest in Ukraine"
UKR_Science_Development_Grants: "Grants For Ukrainian Academy of Science"
UKR_Science_Development_Grants_desc: "Ukrainian Science should become one of the most successful in the new Europe. Thanks to its development with the help of grants, we will ensure a name for ourselves in the world of science."
UKR_Ukrainian_Church_Significant: "Magnify the Ukrainian Church Significance"
UKR_Ukrainian_Church_Significant_desc: "The independent Ukrainian Church is one of the major achievements of Skoropadskyi’s rule. The church plays an important role in the national self-determination of Ukrainians and should be supported."


UKR_Curtail_Protofis_Priveleges: "Curtail Protofis Privileges"
UKR_Curtail_Protofis_Priveleges_desc: "Many have pointed out that unfettered capitalism is what brought Ukraine to ruin in the first place. Poor peasants and small landowners were affected the most by the crisis, and in these times we must not bend to industrialists of Protofis who will certainly only worsen our problems."
UKR_Nationalisation_Of_Property: "Nationalize Our Vital Sectors"
UKR_Nationalisation_Of_Property_desc: "The vital sectors of our economy shall be nationalized and entrusted directly to the state in order to ensure that in time of troubles we have secured our grip over the national economy."
UKR_In_The_Interests_Of_Ukrainians: "Lift the Bread Monopoly"
UKR_In_The_Interests_Of_Ukrainians_desc: "The Bread monopoly has for long prevented our agriculture from developing and our peasants and farmers struggled under fixed bread prices. With the final act of destroying the monopolised price on bread, we will make our agricultural market more open."

### Hetman Unites Russia ###
UKR_Restore_Russian_Empire: "Restore the Russian Empire"
UKR_Restore_Russian_Empire_desc: "The Russian Empire could have been a true paradise on earth, a nation with so much potential hopelessly squandered by self-serving politicians and further shattered by external threats. But Pavlo Skoropadskyi has a grand plan to fix the mistakes of the past. For with the powers vested unto him, he shall restore the Tsardom under new principles of justice and prosperity ensured for all citizens of the crown."
UKR_Ukrainian_Autonomy: "Ukrainian Autonomy"
UKR_Ukrainian_Autonomy_desc: "Contrary to what the clueless amongst our population, or rather the enemies within, may say, the Ukrainian people shall never be subject to the policies of Russification. For the Russophile faction has long agreed with Hetman Skoropadskyi that our nation and people shall receive wide and full autonomy, nay a near total independence, as part of the official structure the reborn Empire shall govern itself with."
UKR_Ally_ROVS: "Ally White Generals"
UKR_Ally_ROVS_desc: "Our Hetman has been friends with the famous Baron Wrangel ever since the Russian Civil War, in which the nation of Ukraine played no small part. The administration of the Hetmanate not only supported the White Generals by suppressing the spread of Bolshevism and Anarchist forces beyond its borders, but also through subsidies given to the voluntary 'Southern Army' meant to relieve the strain felt by commanders such as Wrangel or Ataman Krasnov. Due to this legacy, it is only natural that Skoropadskyi ought to call in favours and reconnect with his former comrades constituting the cadres of the monarchist officer movement in Russia."
UKR_New_Type_Of_Monarchy: "New Type of Monarchy"
UKR_New_Type_Of_Monarchy_desc: "No matter the wishful thinking of many within our camp history has been clear, the Tsars' undiluted reigns led only to unspeakable levels of oppression and destruction of local identities within their realm. Due to the simple consideration that his political goals could not come to fruition in such a climate, the Hetman has made one thing clear, the restored monarchy shall operate under a new system. Where the Tsar is a mere figurehead with Pavlo controlling the throne as a sort of Éminence Grise, yet with a visible public persona."
UKR_Bring_The_Cossacks: "Secure the Cossack Support"
UKR_Bring_The_Cossacks_desc: "The Cossacks of Ukraine have long been the vanguard of our nation's identity. Their cousins in Russia were the Tsar's most loyal soldiers and instruments of the Empire's will, yet not as tools but as truly free and daring spirits. We should combine the wider world of the Cossacks into a new strata, with the aim of stabilizing our regime and keeping the order being at the forefront of their mission."
UKR_Secure_Protofis_Interests: "Secure Protofis Interests"
UKR_Secure_Protofis_Interests_desc: "The Union of Industry, Trade, Finance and Agriculture, commonly known as Protofis, constitutes the most influential Russophile organization within our realm. Without their support, ensured by Borys Butenko, leader of the likewise Russophile Great Landowner faction of the All-Ukrainian Union of Landowners, an organization allied and linked to the Protofis, our recent success would have been entirely impossible. Thus, it is only fair that the interests of the Protofis should be paramount when planning future investments of the state budget. Some may say that the funds could be spent wisely elsewhere, but they do not understand that by increasing the size of the Union the people of the Empire will be provided with more opportunities to enrich themselves and the nation as a whole."

UKR_Align_Kadets: "Align the Kadets"
UKR_Align_Kadets_desc: "In spite of them holding these ridiculous notions of Russian nationalism and clearly visible Ukrainophobia the Kadets could prove to be valuable allies. Their liberal agenda could easily be interwoven with the reforms outlined by the Hetman, same going for their knowledge of economics. Let us reach out to the KDP, marginalize the most ardent chauvinists, and together restore the self-governance institution of the Zemstva."
UKR_Align_VNS: "Align the VNS"
UKR_Align_VNS_desc: "One would imagine that a man like Vasiliy Shulgin, born in Kyiv to a Cossack family of some connection to the Skoropadskyis, would be far from an enemy to the Ukrainian nationhood. Yet the leader of the Russian conservatives held such views in the past, thankfully having renounced them as it became clear that our nation shall never perish. With the influence and connections the VNS possesses they shall serve as a great pillar of our new system, ensuring that true conservative values won't be forgotten."

UKR_Repress_the_Opposition: "Strangle Opposition to Tsar and Hetman"
UKR_Repress_the_Opposition_desc: "Any opposition to our rule, especially organized by the radical chauvinist nationalists and the vermin socialists, cannot be allowed to grow beyond our control. For it was none else than unrestrained masses bewitched by provocateurs which have brought down the last Empire. Let us take inspiration from the man buried in the Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, since as much as you can fault Pyotr Stolypin for certain mistakes he was correct on a very crucial matter. There is no better gift for the dissident and rioter than a thick 'necktie'."
UKR_United_Indivisible_Federative_Empire: "United, Indivisible, Federative Empire"
UKR_United_Indivisible_Federative_Empire_desc: "The people of the Tsardom have long moved past the need of the 'One and Indivisible' mantra. They have already cast aside and forgotten the term filled with so much oppression and chauvinistic hatred. In a restored Russia, an Empire for us all, the motto 'United, Indivisible, Federative' shall be at the helm. Because true national unity cannot be achieved through repression, but only through genuine autonomy for all the peoples living in this grand unity."

UKR_United_Armies: "Fund the United Armies of Ukraine-Russia"
UKR_United_Armies_desc: "The relatively small 'Ukrainian Host' has done a competent job in guarding the borders of our new Empire, yet it is painfully clear that a land so vast cannot be protected by such a small army. This is why the Hetman authorized the funding and creation of a unified Ukrainian-Russian force. With vast resources at our disposal, we shall create a grand military consisting of the veteran Ukrainian officer and supervisory corps, having its responsibility lay in guiding the hordes of eager Russian writers enlisting to serve their new Tsar."

UKR_Glory_To_Russia_As_Part_Of_Ukraine_epic_own_of_russia: "Glory to Ukraine!\nGlory to Russia!"
UKR_Glory_To_Russia_As_Part_Of_Ukraine_epic_own_of_russia_desc: "Back in the year of our lord 1654, when the Pereiaslav Agreement put an end to the independent Hetmanate and placed the Cossacks under an oath pledging allegiance to the Russian Monarchy, none could have expected how history would unfold. And yet we now stand once again united, with the modern Ukrainian Cossacks having restored the Tsardom to its former glory. Yet no longer as subjects, but as brothers, ruling the shared lands in the spirit of true equality between our peoples."

UKR_Restore_Tsardoms_Natural_Borders: "Restore Empire's Natural Borders"
UKR_Restore_Tsardoms_Natural_Borders_desc: "The dissolution of the Russian Empire has been the greatest geopolitical tragedy of the 20th century, for all the people within have been thus torn between foreign imperialists and nefarious forces aiming to only exploit. Yet with the renewed power of the Tsar's crown and the political will of the Hetman the borders of Russia shall be restored to their fullest extent. A return to the natural state of the Empire's expanse."
UKR_Strike_Former_Masters: "Strike the Former Masters"
UKR_Strike_Former_Masters_desc: "The Germans, the Huns, the Prussians. Call them what you will, no matter under which term they may hide today they are the people who have humiliated the Slavic world for centuries. The supposed world hegemons have not only destroyed the original Russian Empire, but also put our brethren in chains of servitude to foreign monarchs. It is high time our former 'masters' bent to our will and felt the burning passion of our revenge."
UKR_Secure_Green_Ukraine: "Expand Green Ukraine"
UKR_Secure_Green_Ukraine_desc: "The concept of Green Ukraine, the Zelenyi Klyn, finds its origin with the Ukrainian settlers of the Russian Far East. Lands which the former Russian government lost to the ideological sectarian struggle against Admiral Kolchak. By using the historical links between the Ukrainian people of that area and the military organizations created by them we could start the process of establishing a vanguard against the ever-encroaching Sino-Japanese influence. The aim of which has always been to tear lands rightfully ours away from the Motherland, a situation we cannot allow to come to pass."

With the establishment of Free Ukraine, the activities of Prosvita blossomed, however, very soon they became very much politically loaded, as the leadership of Prosvita became highly associated with the Dyrektoria.

UKR_Establish_Dictatorship_Of_UKPB_desc: "With the Soviets in Russia at their back, the Komunistychna Partiia (bilshovykiv) Ukrainy under the leadership of the Russophilic Ukrainian Bolshevik and revolutionary Yevhenia Bosh have violently risen to lead the nation towards its red destiny. As their Dictatorship of the Proletariat now rises from the ashes of the old order, Bosh and her crimson clique work to cement themselves as the new vanguard of the Ukranian Revolution while they draft their designs for a new Ukraine entirely transformed by Communism. However, Bosh’s position as one of the world’s first female heads of state is tenuous at best as her failing health begins to catch up with her while new forces vie for dominance from within Kyiv’s peasantry..."
UKR_A_Centralised_Government: "A Centralised Government"
UKR_A_Centralised_Government_desc: "The first step our new Bolshevik-inspired government must take in order to secure the Revolution is to centralize political power and the wider apparatus of state and governance within the hands of Bosh and the other leading members of the Communist Party of Ukraine. Only then can the proletariat be truly freed, and only then can the Revolution truly be secure from threats both foreign and domestic. From atop this consolidated and centralized Dictatorship of the Proletariat, Bosh and the KP(b)U will rule with the entire nation without resistance or obstacles, rendering the state and its future to be nothing but a plaything to be molded to Socialist perfection in the palms of their hands."

Long gone are the glowing days of the Baugy Group and her time as a self-supporting young mother and intellectual revolutionary naive to the harsh future, instead replaced by days of endless struggle as she endeavored to transform Ukraine into a Communist utopia supported by Mother Russia. Her body and soul finally giving out, Bosh leaves the fate of the Revolution in more eager and hungry hands as the rest of the KP(b)U fall into the violent vacuum of power created in her wake, though one figure has begun to rise to the top of the Party hierarchy above all others..."

UKR_Kormchyi_Nikita_Sergeyevich_desc: "From humble beginnings as a Russian-blooded agricultural peasant from Kyiv to now standing as the most dominant revolutionary and political leader in Ukraine, the Great Helmsman - or Kormchyi - Nikita Khrushchev has risen to lead the KP(b)U and the wider Ukrainian Revolution. Dodging claims that he was secretly behind Bosh’s premature death and sidestepping vitriol hurled at him by the Russophobic masses, Khrushchev now leads the highly centralized Dictatorship of the Proletariat organized by his predecessor, leaving him free to choose the direction of the Revolution and the fate of the nation and its people as he ponders on the future of Ukraine at the great crossroads of our political evolution."

UKR_Leader_In_Vyshyvanka_desc: "Clad in the traditional Vyshyvanka garb and dedicated to the local culture and identity of his Ukrainian homeland rather than his own Russian heritage, Mykyta Khrushchov - proudly changing the spelling of his name to match his new identity - shall progress the Ukranian Revolution and the overall Communist dream in a more moderate fashion while dropping the anti-Ukranian, Russophilic slant that dominated the early policies of Bosh’s KP(b)U."
UKR_Luxembourgist_Thought: "Luxemburgist Thought"
UKR_Luxembourgist_Thought_desc: "Staying true to the original anti-Ukranian, Russophilic goals of Bosh’s KP(b)U, Nikita Khrushchev shall continue to progress the Revolution along Luxemburgist lines in order to create a Communist system supported by ideas penned by Rosa Luxemburg, such as an intense aversion towards democratic centralism in favor of revolutionary social democracy supported by Communism, anti-Blanquism and a distaste for Socialist elitist as practiced by the Party and compromised vanguardist groups that strayed from true Leninism, and the mass involvement of the proletariat in revolutionary matters and action."
UKR_Invite_Ukapists_Khrusch: "Unity with the Ukapists"
UKR_Invite_Ukapists_Khrusch_desc: "The Ukrainian Communist Party - more commonly called the Ukapists - have traditionally been our rivals on the Left, for the Ukapists have frequently battled with our own KP(b)U throughout the past, mostly due to our Party’s former anti-Ukrainian slant under Bosh. However, with Chairman Khrushchov now at the helm actively eroding away our former Russophilic tendencies in favor of Ukrainian unity, we have begun to approach our old rivals with open arms instead of clenched fists. Together, the two truly Marxist parties of Ukraine - the Ukapists and the Bolsheviks - shall work in unison in order to create a brighter future for our people and a more secure Revolution."
UKR_Premier_Vynnychenko: "Premier Vynnychenko"
UKR_Premier_Vynnychenko_desc: "In an effort to foster wider unity among the Ukrainian Left while also showing Chairman Khrushov’s own good faith towards his new pro-Ukrainian slant and identity, we have moved to name Volodymyr Vynnychenko as the new Premier of the Party and right-hand man to Khrushov in government. A lifetime political activist, author, artist, statesman, and a Founding Father of Ukraine, Vynnychenko served as the first and third Prime Minister of the Ukrainian People’s Republic in 1917 as a member of the Ukrainian Social Democratic Party, and has forever since stood as a titan of Ukrainian nationalism and Leftism. With this true Ukrainian hero and patriot at Khrushov’s side, the Party shall largely be free to progress the Revolution with the aid of masses loyal to the new Premier’s legacy."
UKR_Moderate_liberalisation: "A Thaw with Ukrainian Characteristics"
UKR_Moderate_liberalisation_desc: "With our pro-Ukrainian direction solidified and with our new allies aiding us in our revolutionary cause, Chairman Khrushchov has begun what he calls ‘The Ukrainian Thaw’ or the ‘Rasputitsa’, named so after the muddy and rainy season that follows the coldest part of Winter as the world begins to awake and embrace the new growth and beauty of the coming Spring. The icy, violent Winter of violent reaction and radicalism shall finally come to an end as the KP(b)U embraces its Ukrainian homeland and identity with new gusto. The harshest and most outwardly violent or distasteful policies on both the domestic and international stages shall be rescinded, de-radicalized, or reformed as Khrushchov paints our regime in a new, more inviting and seemingly friendlier light in order to attract more allies and create more opportunities for our Revolution to not only survive, but to blossom and prosper in this new Spring. However, though we may look declawed and defanged, we shall always have bite, for the Great Kormchyi shall guide us towards safe prosperity and Communist utopia regardless of how thawed we may become."
UKR_Rely_On_Russian_Cadres: "Rely on Russian Cadres"
UKR_Rely_On_Russian_Cadres_desc: "With no possible allies to speak of within the Ukrainian political space, our KP(b)U under Chairman Khrushchev will have to rely on the Russians for support and aid. By working with the various cadres, soviets, and other Communist groups from Mother Russia, we shall be able to bolster the Ukrainian Revolution. We shall flood these lands with Russian-Bolshevik militants, revolutionaries, agitators, firebrands, and more, organizing them into new units and utilizing them as a free and secretive arm of the Party so that we may secure the Revolution and Khrushchev’s wider dream for this wretched land."
UKR_No_National_Question_in_my_realm: "No National Question in My Realm!"
UKR_No_National_Question_in_my_realm_desc: "The ‘national question’ of Ukrainian statehood and the wider dubious claim that the Ukrainian identity is distinct from the Russian whole, and as such must be sovereign, are nothing but pseudoscientific and ahistorical hogwash created by the elitist bourgeois in Kyiv in order to carve out their own vile fiefdom of capital and reaction free from the Russian truth and the interests of the true Slavic masses. Even denying Luxemburg’s own ideas of the National Question as a political concept along with ideas of autonomy and self-determination, the KP(b)U under Chairman Khrushchev will not stand for any notions of ‘Ukrainization’ in the slightest. Ukraine is Russia, and Russia is Ukraine, and it is high time that every wayward and misinformed soul in this godforsaken land learn this hard truth immediately and without compromise, delay, or mercy for those that resist."
UKR_Imprison_Ukrainian_Communists: "Imprison Ukrainian Communists"
UKR_Imprison_Ukrainian_Communists_desc: "Despite being fellow Communists and allies on the Left dedicated to the notion of Marxist Revolution, the Ukapists of the Ukrainian Communist Party and others like them are not to be trusted. Not wishing to let our rivals and potential enemies strike first, we shall move to arrest and imprison the lot of them, along with any other political enemies of Ukrainian origin. Only then will our Russophilic Revolution finally be safe and sound."
UKR_Moving_Forward: "Introduce the Semiletka"
UKR_Moving_Forward_desc: "The Semiletka, or the Seven-Year Plan, has been organized and drafted by [ROOT.GetLeader] and the Party in order to maximize economic, technological, industrial, and agricultural advancement and efficiency as we try to push the Revolution to new heights atop the endless planning and sprawling goals of the KP(b)U. Naturally, we shall institute quotas and other additional failsafes in order to push the proletariat to finish these plans earlier, allowing us to plan the next one more quickly while also proving to the world that Ukraine is a modern and industrial superpower that should not be trifled with."
UKR_Mass_Nationalization_Khrusch: "Mass Nationalization"
UKR_Mass_Nationalization_Khrusch_desc: "In accordance with the Seven-Year Plan, all of Ukrainian society - from the smallest landholding to the largest monopoly - is to be nationalized. Only with all economic power within the hands of the central government can the Revolution truly progress along an efficient and well-oiled track, and no greedy bourgeois or petty elitist shall stop the proletariat from getting their just due."
UKR_Great_Industrial_Land: "Great Industrial Land"
UKR_Great_Industrial_Land_desc: "With the proletarian spirit awakened, vast industrial plants and factories are being built all across our lands in once-squandered regions that were fields of crops or barren, useless lots only a year ago. And next to them, workers’ towns and proletarian communities are being built so that our laborers have a place to live nearby. Operating in accordance with the Semiletka, this process of large-scale industrialization and mechanization of society shall continue as planned until Ukraine stands toe to toe with the other industrial giants of the world on equal footing."
UKR_Sprawling_Cities: "Sprawling Cities"
UKR_Sprawling_Cities_desc: "From the hustle and bustle of Kyiv and Kharkiv to the quiet farming villages along the lower Dnieper, the heartland of Ukraine’s population centers have begun to embrace the idea of mass urbanization as the cities of Ukraine slowly turn into concrete jungles and steel metropolises. Though we shall always have a rural population, largely dedicated to our agricultural pursuits, we must have a dense, sprawling, and profitable urban expanse if we are to compete with the other growing superpowers."
UKR_Industrial_Smoke: "Industrial Smoke"
UKR_Industrial_Smoke_desc: "As smoke stacks billow and the smog of industrial progress oozes out of our factories like a great, dark miasma of modern prosperity, the skies and the lungs of the proletariat may darken, but our future shines brighter and more clearly than ever! Industrial smoke is merely the sign of an advanced and prosperous society living at the cutting-edge of mechanized science and industrialized society. Surely it is nothing to be worried about, for our Revolution only bears fruits of plenty and progress, not reaction or demise."
UKR_Start_Collectivization: "Start Collectivisation"
UKR_Start_Collectivization_desc: "The bourgeois that once ran the former, failed Ukrainian governments made serious mistakes and missteps in the past while chasing the opiate-like allure of profit, turning Ukraine into a hotbed for Kulaks, land owners, and lecherous agriculturists over decades of mismanagement and reactionary-fueled idiocy. Mass and immediate efforts of collectivisation is the only answer to this grave injustice. New communes and collectives shall rise across Ukraine by diktat of the Party in order to remedy this sickly existence until all agriculture in Ukraine is free from the predatory nature of failed capitalism."

UKR_Cornification: "CORNIFICATION"
UKR_Cornification_desc: "By no doubt, if there is a vegetable that can grow anywhere it is surely the wonderplant known as corn - and after Khrushchev’s recent visit to America, there is no doubt it should grow and be cultivated to become the centerpiece of Europe’s Breadbasket back here at home. Pivoting his focus and the priorities of the Party drastically, the ‘Corn Lord’ as he is now known [ROOT.GetLeader] shall create a new system of Communist industry based entirely around the cultivation and application of corn and corn-based technologies, all for the greater good of Ukraine and the Revolution."
UKR_Corn_Based_Products: "Corn-Based Products"
UKR_Corn_Based_Products_desc: "Seeking to utilize every aspect and part of the corn plant in some form or another to aid the state, the Party under [ROOT.GetLeader] has begun funding a research and development division entirely based around the goal of finding every possible use for the plant and crop there is. Though many scoff at this idea, we know the true genius behind this move, for building a self-sufficient system can be really easy and affordable when you utilize the same easy-to-grow high-yield crop for every product."
UKR_Feed_Cattle_With_Corn: "Feed Cattle With Corn"
UKR_Feed_Cattle_With_Corn_desc: "Recent scientific studies conducted both in the Americas and back here in our own labs show that cattle and other livestock like sheep fed with corn live healthier lives and yield more produce, like meat and milk, with higher nutritional value, or can yield greater amounts of higher-quality material like wools and leathers. With this knowledge in mind, we shall begin to feed all livestock in Ukraine on a diet based largely around corn with other minor supplements to fill in the nutritional gaps, lowering running-costs for our farmers and agricultural workers while increasing yield across the board."
UKR_Corn_Silk: "Corn Silk Clothes"
UKR_Corn_Silk_desc: "By utilizing the long silk-like fibers that grow out of ears of corn and within the stalks and husks of the crop, we have been able to create a new domestic textile industry to supplement and even eventually replace more expensive rival industries like cotton. Called ‘corn silk’, the fibers have long been known to hold health benefits as an herbal remedy, brewed into teas and extracts or even smoked or plain ingested for the medicinal effects, but now they have a far more widespread and beneficial use as a cheap, replenishable, abundant, and comfortable textile to be used in all facets of Ukrainian society, from the creation of our vyshyvanka and other clothing to more industrial applications."
UKR_Conoplya_Plantations: "Konoplia Plantations"
UKR_Conoplya_Plantations_desc: "While some believe that Konoplia, called Hemp in the West, is a threat to national health, we believe that we can use this wonderful plant as a raw material in a variety of industries in order to supplement corn production. From use as a fuel, a textile, a source of clean-burning lamp oil, a source of cheap, strong paper and resistant construction materials, and even as a recreational and medicinal drug in some cases when specific types of hemp called cannabis is used, along with a million other uses, these new konoplia plantations shall help create a stress-free and self-sufficient Ukraine guided by Communist genius."
UKR_Industrial_Farming: "Industrial Farming"
UKR_Industrial_Farming_desc: "It is not enough to just simply move some dirt and plant some seeds, for modern farming requires modern solutions if we are to successfully and reliably feed a nation of millions. Our agricultural industry must become as industrialized and as mechanized as our other lynchpin industries, for our corn-based industry is as important as any other facet of our economy, and if one facet begins to lag behind, the entire system and wider Revolution will lag along with it. As such, we will modernize our agrarian pursuits without restraint so that the cornbasket of Europe can truly begin to blossom."
UKR_Corn_Infrastracture: "Corn Infrastructure"
UKR_Corn_Infrastracture_desc: "As our new cornfields continue to grow and sprawl out far past the outskirts of any centralized population center, Ukraine risks becoming an unconnected island of farmsteads and cities lost among the amber waves of grain unless we do something to stop it. As such, new infrastructure intiratives shall be started across the nation, building new roads and bridges and tunnels with our corn industry in mind above all other worries. We will unite the disparate corn farms and collectives across Ukraine into an interconnected corn superhighway that works in perfect harmony and synchrony with each other, fueling the Revolution to new heights atop perfectly greased wheels and newly paved asphalt."
UKR_Great_Irrigational_Projects: "Great Irrigational Projects"
UKR_Great_Irrigational_Projects_desc: "To grow a lot of corn, one first needs a lot of water, and in the marshy depths of rural Ukraine, irrigation and clean, reliable water has never been needed more. We shall create a new earthenworks division that shall be specifically tasked with modernizing and expanding the irrigational networks of every farmstead and collective in Ukraine, allowing us to provide water for thousands of Kolkhozes and all the corn they could possibly grow."
UKR_New_Farming_Communes: "Introduction of 'Kukuruza Kolkhoz'"
UKR_New_Farming_Communes_desc: "Until our political ascendance, the Kolkhoz - or a traditional collective farm run by Ukrainian peasants from long before the rise of Communism - was just the most efficient way of organizing agricultural work in Ukraine. However, thanks to the brilliant innovations designed by our Great Kormchyi [ROOT.GetLeader], a new form of collective farm shall rise. Called the Kukuruza Kolkhoz, these evolved communes are self-sufficient, collectivized agricultural communities entirely dedicated to the cultivation of corn and its related produce, such as corn silk. Beloved by [ROOT.GetLeader] himself as his own creative brainchild, the Kukuruza Kolkhoz plan has been presented to modernist and Leftist exhibitions across Europe as a stunning example of Bolshevik realism at work as they are steadily erected and organized across Ukraine, greatly increasing our efficiency when it comes to growing corn."

UKR_A_Future_Ahead: "A Future Ahead!"
UKR_A_Future_Ahead_desc: "With our corn-based economy and Communist political system melding perfectly as the Revolution steadily continues, a bright and prosperous future lies ahead of us thanks to the endless efforts of the Great Helmsman. If [ROOT.GetLeader]’s generous projections are to be believed, true Communism and Leninist utopia will be finally achieved within the following decades if we continue along at this same breakneck pace. To celebrate this momentous occasion, a special congress of the Party has been called, and all in the nation now await the Great Kormchyi’s celebratory speech..."

UKR_Khruschovizatsia_desc: "With the foundations of his regime now solidified, the Great Helmsman has begun to look beyond as he carries the torch of the Revolution and spreads its glorious crimson light and proletarian benefits to every corner of Ukraine. However, with as many allies as he has, our Chairman has many more enemies who wish to snake their way into the hearts and minds of the gullible masses in an attempt to turn the proletariat against their savior. This cannot be allowed to happen! The masses must know who they can thank for their salvation, for they will surely never turn back on the man that brought them utopia. A personality cult shall be constructed around the Great Kormchyi in order to solidify his image with the state and the Party itself, for [ROOT.GetLeader] is Ukraine, and Ukraine is [ROOT.GetLeader]."
UKR_Khrushchyovka: "Introduce the '[GetUKR_KhruschevsLastName]ka'"
UKR_Khrushchyovka_desc: "'Khrushchyovka' is the unofficial designation for a new type of low-cost, concrete-paneled three to five-storied apartment building developed at the request of our leader [ROOT.GetLeader]. Mass production of these tenement structures should finally solve the housing problem that has begun to balloon in the rapidly expanding urban centers being built at the behest of the regime, while their construction should provide an influx of new jobs that shall help with the unemployment crisis as well. Killing two birds with one stone, these garrish concrete structures, usually painted in wild colors to hide their drab nature, shall provide jobs and housing all in one for those that need it."
UKR_For_Every_Houes_A_Bloc_Car: "Every Bloc House - A Bloc Car!"
UKR_For_Every_Houes_A_Bloc_Car_desc: "With new automobile plants opening across Ukraine like the central plant in the Zaporizhia region, our citizens can now afford the brand new Zaporozhets - an affordable, ‘reliable’ automobile designed for the proletarian masses. Unfortunately, they won’t buy it, as sales figures show that these jalopies are far from popular with the public. To solve this issue, we shall bypass the market entirely by providing a Zaporozhets car for every bloc house! This shall grant each Khrushchyovka a shared automobile to be used by the tennents, bringing the fancy thrills, status, and usefulness of car-ownership to the masses."

UKR_State_Socialist_Mysticism: "State Socialist Mysticism"
UKR_State_Socialist_Mysticism_desc: "The Great Kormchyi has initiated a slew of grandiose state programs that aim to inject more ‘esoteric’ ideas and concepts into Ukraine’s national culture, art, science, and even political philosophy. Drawing on ideas from Russian circles on Cosmism, Spiritualism, Spiritism, Mysticism, and wider Occultism, our beloved Helmsman will force the proletariat to embrace epigenesis - or spiritual evolution - in order to embrace every aspect of Communism, both physical and ephemeral. Together, we shall seek to breed a nation of well-rounded and harmoniously-developed individuals who are all devoted to spiritual self-perfection, and who will all ultimately ‘work, live and create according to the laws of beauty.’"
UKR_Atomic_Program: "Atomic Program"
UKR_Atomic_Program_desc: "The Nuclear age has truly begun! By working off initial research done by individual teams in Russia, Germany, and America, our scientists, physicists, and engineers have been able to kickstart a nuclear program of our own. We are now actively working on our own energy and weapons systems that will utilize this new nuclear tech. Soon the world shall learn to not mess with Ukraine ever again!"

UKR_Show_Them_Kuzkas_Mother_desc: "A secret weapon is rumored to have been developed in our most isolated and secretive laboratories by the brightest minds Ukraine has to offer. Nicknamed ‘Kuzka’s Mother’ by our great leader, the world shall tremble in fear when they finally behold its awesome destructive power. The time of Ukraine being shoved around by foreign bullies is finally over, so let us finally show our hand..."
UKR_Pig_Production: "Pork Production"
UKR_Pig_Production_desc: "Pork, and other produce of pigs or swine, has always been a popular delicacy here in Ukraine, with pork and salo featuring in many local dishes while other, less-edible parts of the animal are used in a variety of industries and applications. Famous for consuming anything, we shall grow our swineherds plentiful and fat on the natural bounty of corn, ensuring no waste in our agricultural system as pigs eat the parts of the corn we cannot use, or the excess corn we cannot process, while providing great bounty and succulent taste in return."
UKR_Naukograds: "Build the Naukograds"
UKR_Naukograds_desc: "Also called Technopoles, the Naukograds - literally translating to ‘science cities’ - shall rise across Ukraine to serve as new centralized centers for our academia to flourish in. Urban centers and small towns filled with high concentrations of research and development facilities, universities, laboratories, and more, these Naukograds shall become the interconnected heart of Ukrainian science and technology, dragging this once-backwards land into the glorious wonders of a scientific future."
UKR_Breed_Corn_Variety: "Breed New Varieties of Corn"
UKR_Breed_Corn_Variety_desc: "Taking a note from our agricultural allies in the Americas, [ROOT.GetLeader] has pushed for our eggheads and agricultural scientists to develop and breed new forms of corn that will better serve the Party. From tastier, juicer, and bigger corn meant for human consumption to hairier corn cultivated for their corn silk or drought-resistant corn to survive the harsh Ukrainian Winters, we shall grow as many new types of corn that we need, for [ROOT.GetLeader] teaches us that corn is Communism, and Communism is corn."

ukrel.5.t: "[GetYear] Elections Postponed"
ukrel.5.d: "Following the breakout of the war, many began to wonder what would come of the planned [GetYear] general elections. The tenure of the [UKR.GetRulingParty] government is slowly coming to an end, and although an election should be held in the coming weeks, the current situation has certainly complicated matters. The [GetUkrainianParliamentFullName] has, therefore, voted to postpone the election and allow the government to remain in power until peace returns to our lands.\n\nSeveral figures in the [GetUkrainianParliamentName] and government have stated that holding elections at a time like this would be irresponsible. This is a sentiment shared by the majority of the Ukrainian populace, but many are disappointed to hear that they will have to wait so long to have their voices heard again.

### Economy Focuses ###
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis: "Agricultural Crisis Reaction"
UKR_Agricultural_Crisis_desc: "The agricultural crisis has almost shattered the Ukrainian economy and stability in the country. The King barely controls the country, those loyal to the Hetman peasants want land reforms, pro-Russian forces and Nationalists demand radical measures and the Socialists mobilise their supporters all over the country..."
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia: "Stabilize the Hryvnia"
UKR_Stabilize_Hryvnia_desc: "For the first time, hryvnia was released into circulation on October 17, 1918. Initially, the hryvnia was supposed to play the role of domestic loan bonds. However, the shortage of banknotes in circulation led to the fact that both bonds and individual coupons began to be used as money at the beginning of 1919. During this time, the economy has stabilized and many of the efforts of former Finance Minister Anton Rzhepetskyi to stabilize the national Ukrainian currency have been justified. However, due to Black Monday, the situation has worsened. Urgent measures must be taken to stabilize the Hryvnia!"
UKR_deposit_protection_law: "Empower Derzhavnyi Bank"
UKR_deposit_protection_law_desc: "By 1936, a wide network of credit and banking institutions with a multi-level structure was created in the country, which covered all branches of the agrarian-industrial economy of the region. It ensured the normal movement of goods, money and credit resources, although its power was significantly inferior to similar systems of industrial and industrial-agrarian countries of Western Europe. However, now our system needs additional support from the state. By giving extra powers to the Derzhavnyi (State) Bank, we can make sure it can bail out failing commercial banks."
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works: "State-Sponsored Construction Works"
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works_desc: "To industrialize the country and do so fast, the state needs to direct money and resources towards construction projects which are critical to the economy of the state and so need to be finished quickly. Let us create a system of these works and help the Ukrainian economy grow."
UKR_State_Sponsored_Construction_Works_tt: "We will unlock £GFX_decision_icon_small Decisions to §HIndustrialize§! Ukraine"
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks: "Rural Credit Banks"
UKR_Rural_Credit_Banks_desc: "With the agricultural crisis raging, credit is not a popular thing in the rural areas. The State Land Bank refused to give credits directly to the farms, being on the edge of default. We should establish rural banking systems, created to give poor peasants access to much-needed financial support and credit."
UKR_rural_banks_tt: "§CLand reform decisions will cost 20 less political power.§!"
UKR_Resume_Cash_Crop_Exportation: "Resume Cash Crop Exportation"
UKR_Resume_Cash_Crop_Exportation_desc: "Ukraine retains a very agrarian economy, but the recent economic troubles did severe damage to our major agricultural exports. With the economy market prices largely stabilised, we can resume agricultural exports and invest these profits."
UKR_compensation_for_losses: "Compensation for Losses"
UKR_compensation_for_losses_desc: "While a much more costly decision, than establishing rural credit banking system, direct compensation for losses, caused by the agricultural crisis, will help our agrarians and build up trust for our government."
UKR_compensation_for_losses_tt: "§CLand reform will take longer time to complete.§!"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery: "Begin Ukrainian Recovery"
UKR_Ukrainian_Recovery_desc: "Social problems always provoke political instability. Lots of peasants join Socialist, nationalist or Russian separatist movements because of awful living conditions. If we want to save Ukraine from collapse, we should start a recovery programme and help the poorest grain-growers in Central Ukraine, providing our population with the cheap electricity they require. For this, we need cash."

 ### Army ### (Changed into Skoropadskyi's Army, Nationalist Army, Republican Army and Socialist Army)
 UKR_ostwall_focus: "The Ostwall Programme"
 UKR_ostwall_focus_desc: "Originally envisioned by the Baltische Landswehr in the late 1920s, \"The East Wall\" is a comprehensive system of fortifications on the front line nations of the Reichspakt. Ukraine is too large and has too many salients to support a single continuous line of fortifications, but some of our own officers began formulating plans for a modified Ostwall, plans in which the cadets have taken immense interest."
 UKR_army_internal_structure_review: "The Army Internal Structure Review"
 UKR_army_internal_structure_review_desc: "As 1936 rolls around, Hetman Pavlo Skoropadskyi, on behalf of King Vasyl, sets out to conduct his yearly review of the Army’s Internal Structure. A personal project of the Hetman, Skoropadskyi has dedicated much of time and resources to grooming the developing Military Apparatus."
 UKR_fate_of_freikorps: "Fate of Ukrainisches Freikorps"
 UKR_fate_of_freikorps_desc: "Established in 1919, the Ukrainian Freikorps helped the Hetman to provide his army with German volunteers in exchange for land. For some, however, this becomes a real problem. We should decide what to do with Freikorps and possibly disband it."
 
 UKR_army_research_bureau: "Establish the Army Research Bureau"
 UKR_army_research_bureau_desc: "As we march into the future, it becomes plainly obvious that new wars will rather be won using superior technology than any long-form trench warfare or “flood-wave” tactics. As such, we should establish an Army department tasked with staying on top of any new developments in Doctrinal or Technological enhancements."
 UKR_armament_program: "Reserve Armament Programme"
 UKR_armament_program_desc: "Our reserve manpower is easily over a million men - but the harsh truth is that we barely have equipment to arm half that many in case of mobilisation. It must be solved quickly."
 UKR_state_arsenals: "Inspectorate of the Arsenals"
 UKR_state_arsenals_desc: "The Ukrainian arms industry is spread across the country with no overall coordinating body to direct research and production. Appointing a military body to oversee them would ensure efficiency."
 UKR_state_arsenals_tt: "\nBeware, as our overall §CIndustrialisation Score§! increases, the §Garmament facilities§! that can be gained increases while reducing the immediate bonus to §CIndustrialisation Score§!.\n"
 
 UKR_centralise_military_railway_service: "Centralise the Military Railway Service"
 UKR_centralise_military_railway_service_desc: "A unified logistical structure is the lifeblood of any army defending a country as large as Ukraine. All trains used by the army will be organised by single department under the headquarters of the army, instead of the current regional organisation."
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology: "Implement Army Radio Service"
 UKR_adopt_modern_radio_technology_desc: "The Army Radio Service can easily be considered one of the pillars of future warfare. Yet, the service still lacks a proper centralized structure to make its use effective. Let us implement a centralized scheme."
  
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy: "Refurbish Odesa Military Academy"
 UKR_refurbish_odessa_military_academy_desc: "As one of the oldest Military Academies in the former Russian Empire, the Odesa Military Academy is a prime education source for the arts of war. Nevertheless, the Academy has never gotten proper oversight since our Independence. Time to change that."
 
 
 UKR_reform_committee: "Army Reform Committee"
 UKR_reform_committee_desc: "The old army of the Hetman was corrupt and inefficient. Instead of a military dictator, the commander-in-chief will be the government-appointed Supreme Otaman and his regional representatives. In this way, army leadership is in the hands of professional soldiers, yet under civilian control, as it should be in any modern state."
 UKR_curtail_army_factionalism: "Curtail Army Factionalism"
 UKR_curtail_army_factionalism_desc: "There has been animosity between army's former Russian generals and younger, more Ukrainian nationalist-minded men. Sometimes this mistrust has even affected the army promotions in a negative way. All this factionalism needs to go. Promotions must be decided by a neutral committee appointed by the [UKR_leader_title], and all kind of nepotism must be crushed."
 UKR_Expand_National_Guard: "Expand the National Guard"
 UKR_Expand_National_Guard_desc: "The Natsionalna Hvardiia, established first as the His Serene Highness Hetman's loyal troops, in order to defend him from any trouble, should be expanded and united with Derzhavna Varta into a single defensive force that should deal with resistance and guard our country from any enemies."
  
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation: "Doctrinal Experimentation"
 UKR_doctrinal_experimentation_desc: "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on newly developed warfare doctrines. For such a task, he has turned to the Top Officers’ Corps, composed of high Officers of the Independence Era - Oleksandr Udovychenko and Oleksandr Zahrodskyi."
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills: "Rapid Mobility Drills"
 UKR_rapid_mobility_drills_desc: "High Armored Mobility is key in modern warfare. Which is why we should make sure we have an ample supply of armored mechanical vehicles that we know how to properly utilize."
 UKR_Tractors_to_Tanks: "From Tractors to Tanks"
 UKR_Tractors_to_Tanks_desc: "Agricultural mechanisation has created Ukraine’s most prominent industry: Agricultural tractors. With the growth of our automotive and agricultural machinery industry, it is possible to convert civilian production into military vehicles, including tanks."
 UKR_tank_corps: "Ukrainian Armoured Corps"
 UKR_tank_corps_desc: "With German-built tanks, we can organise our first proper armoured division as the core for future expansion. A quick armoured force will form our fist in the plains of Ukraine."
 
 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg: "Lessons of the Weltkrieg"
 UKR_lessons_of_the_weltkrieg_desc: "Emboldened by the rise in global tensions, the Hetman has appealed for solidification of a proper course for the army, based on experiences of the Weltkrieg. For such a task, he has turned to the High Officers’ Corps, composed of top Officers of the Former Russian Imperial Army - Mykhailo Omelianovych-Pavlenko, Oleksandr Hrekiv and Kostiantyn Prisovskyi."
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school: "Expand the Kyiv Officer School"
 UKR_expand_kyiv_officer_school_desc: "The Kyiv Officer Instruction School was established in 1918, during the first year of Hetman Skoropadskyi’s rule (but before the coronation of King Vasyl) and since then has been a consistent source of newfangled officer graduates. We should take steps to expand it."
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces: "Consolidate the Reserve Forces"
 UKR_consolidate_the_reserve_forces_desc: "Currently, our reserve forces are spread out across various departments as a consequence of the bureaucratic disease. We should take steps to rectify this misdirection and unify the reservists across a streamlined number of detachments."
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan: "Implement the 48-Hour Plan"
 UKR_implement_48_hour_plan_desc: "Informally known as the “48-Hour Plan”, this plan exists as a contingency effort to make sure we can defend ourselves from a total onslaught in the event of a massive invasion (most likely from the East). Successful implementation would allow us to enact a total mobilisation in the nation and make sure the foreign invaders are stopped."

 UKR_mobile_infantry: "Rapid Infantry Doctrine"
 UKR_mobile_infantry_desc: "The doctrine adapted widely in the Oststaat in the 1920s has been that of manoeuvre, as German instructors have brought their proven ways of war to our training. Our method cannot rely as much on armour and air force as the German one does, but we compensate for the lack of heavy equipment with large numbers of mounted and motorised units, who can move rapidly and use their localised numerical superiority to break enemy strongpoints."
 
 UKR_hetman_army: "Landeswehr Inspiration"
 UKR_hetman_army_desc: "The Baltic Landeswehr always was a source of inspiration for the Hetman. A professional, regular army of Baltic Germans, that, despite their minority, were able to organzie themselves into a true army. Despite our country is much bigger and much more populated, we should stick to our principles of regular and professional army. Only this will ensure our abilities to defend ourselves."
 UKR_integration_of_cossacks: "Integration of the Cossack Councils"
 UKR_integration_of_cossacks_desc: "Modern Cossack organisation was founded to promote the martial virtues, but their connection to the professional military has been strenuous. Ideally, they should become part of the reserve proper, and trained and equipped to be easily integrated into professional units in the time of war."
 UKR_interservice_cooperation: "Interservice Cooperation"
 UKR_interservice_cooperation_desc: "Instead of infantryman, or artilleryman, or sailors, they are all knights of Ukraine. Rivalry between branches must end, and a common spirit needs to be created to foster mentality of cooperation between different arms."
 UKR_primacy_of_maneuver: "Primacy of Manoeuvre"
 UKR_primacy_of_maneuver_desc: "Fighting a war of attrition against Russia is an exercise in futility. In the endless plains of Ukraine and Russia, manoeuvre is the key to victory. Whoever can strike first and move fastest will gain the edge, and if they are tenacious enough, they will keep it."
 UKR_valour_and_victory: "Valour & Victory"
 UKR_valour_and_victory_desc: "While a soldier's physical skills matter, what truly creates victory is their moral character. Valour was how the Greeks could defeat great Persian armies: valour is how we defeated Napoleon, and lack of it was what caused the downfall of the Russian armies two decades prior. A soldier is only as strong as their conviction."
 
 UKR_focus_on_quality: "Professional Striltsi-Based Host"
 UKR_focus_on_quality_desc: "We should not rely on common soldiers. Instead, we should build a professional army based on Sichovi Striltsi, our elite infantry division, consisting of true patriots."
 UKR_USS_Tactics: "Use the Striltsi Tactics"
 UKR_USS_Tactics_desc: "The Sichovi Striltsi has a glorious history not only as a part of Ukrainian divisions in Austrian Army, but as elite force of the best officers in the army of independent Ukraine. They usually consist of patriotic and nationalist elements, that will definitely have a final say in defending Ukrainian territory."
 UKR_national_mobilisation: "National Mobilisation"

System of Hetman-appointed regional Otamans was too unwieldy, and often the Otamans either had to wait for orders for long time, or went entirely outside their given orders. This military adventurism must stop, and the system needs to be formalised properly."

 UKR_shock_artillery_fire_desc: "Sometimes, using artillery fire is necessary not so much for defeating the enemy, as much as disorganising and discombobulating it.

 UKR_reverse_engineer_artillery_desc: "Artillery has become more and more useful in warfare, so much so that many frontline battalions nowadays are exclusively based on punishing artillery fire.

 UKR_review_structure_desc: "The Skoropadskyi-era army was too rigid, too hierarchical. It was not capable of fast enough decision-making nor improvisation.

 UKR_Revive_Chernova_Kavaleria_desc: "Despite the dwindling use of cavalry in modern warfare, in a country such as Ukraine, horse cavalry still has use as support and mobile troops because of our terrain and lacklustre infrastructure, and historical traditions.

Born as Mykola Fitiliov in Trostianets, Kharkiv Governorate to a Russian laborer father and Ukrainian schoolteacher mother. His father, had noble origins but was, as Khvyliovyi himself wrote, \"a highly careless person\" and a drunkard. He spoke Russian, and it was thanks to him that the boy read both Russian and foreign classics. Khvyliovyi shared his father's interest in the revolutionary movement of the 1860s, sympathised with the ideology of the Narodniks. Firstly, a member of UPSR, Khvyliovyi, like many other soldiers, drifted towards Bolshevik party. When party collapsed, he followed other fellow Ukrainian bolsheviks such as Skrypnyk to join newly founded Ukrainian Communist Party in fighting against all opressions. Khvyliovyi led an underground resistance to Hetmans rule together with other Ukapists and Borotbysts. With UKP alignment to Dyrektoria, most underground activities of Khvyliovyi moved to mainly organizational — to maintain and widen communist structures in Ukraine, not provoking preliminary violence, that can weaken movement. In that period, Khvyliovyi, extremely talanted writer, uses the posibility to write more. He writes texts about Hetman's brutality, controversies in resistance, deeply emotional texts about revolutionaries and executionaries and their compromised and traumatic morales. As a prominent revolutionary and talanted writer, he also engages in political debates, where he develops conception of \"psychological Europe\" and \"asiatic Renaissance\", both admiring cultural progress of Western Europe, and cultural and political upheaval, that Kuomintang, Indian and Vietnamese revolutionaries bring.\n\nIn that, Khvyliovyi actively works on both ensuring Ukraine's high cultural level, and Ukraine's role in the world as a progressive country aligned with socialist Europe and World revolution" #ukp foreign

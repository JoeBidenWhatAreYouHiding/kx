MAF_Belgian_Investors:0 "Flandro-Wallonian Investors"

MAF_post_collapse_army:0 "'Unconventional' Army"
MAF_post_collapse_army_desc:0 "Armies created following the collapse of Mittelafrika aren't conventional. They don't have the same ability to defend and hold the line as more standard divisions, but are better able to move and fight in the harsh conditions of Africa. Additionally, while conventional factories are few and far between there are ample opportunities to scavenge equipment, providing a steady if limited supply of arms."

### Opinion Modifies ###
MAF_Refused_Explain:0 "Portugal Refused to Stop Rebels"

### Focuses ###
MAF_Big_Change:0 "Time for Change"
MAF_Big_Change_desc:0 "It is time for change; we can no longer sit on the fence. We must either centralise or decentralise our nation if we are to keep hold of Africa."
MAF_New_Administration:0 "A New Administration"
MAF_New_Administration_desc:0 "In order to further assert our control over Africa, it is necessary to take inventory of our administrators and staff, and coordinate a plan of action."
MAF_Sovereign_State:0 "A Sovereign State"
MAF_Sovereign_State_desc:0 "Now that von Göring's position as Sovereign Statthalter has been established, it is time to turn the rest of our administration toward furthering our autonomy and authority."
MAF_Establish_Lion_Society:0 "Establish the Lion Society"
MAF_Establish_Lion_Society_desc:0 "Africa has long been rumoured to harbour secret societies like the 'Leopard' and 'Crocodile' societies, who are supposedly responsible for many unsolved murders and criminal acts. We can borrow this air of mystique for our own growing body of assassins and illicit enterprises."
MAF_End_Protectorates:0 "End the Protectorates"
MAF_End_Protectorates_desc:0 "Mittelafrika has always been a patchwork of treaties established with various African kingdoms, which retained their autonomy and royalty in exchange for acceptance of German sovereignty. It is time to end this, and have one law and one sovereign entity in Mittelafrika."
MAF_Annex_British_Colonies:0 "Annex The British Colonies"
MAF_Annex_British_Colonies_desc:0 "In 1925 the Island of Britain fell to the plague of socialism. Our armies moved into British territory to prevent the revolution from reaching Africa, establishing a trusteeship over the British colonies until a 'responsible British government' could be restored. We shall end this farce, the colonies are ours by right of conquest."
MAF_Vizekonig:0 "Assume the Title 'Vizekönig'"
MAF_Vizekonig_desc:0 "The Statthalter is not merely a bureaucrat fulfilling a government role. We have already established that he is not accountable to Germany, and it is now important to establish that he is co-equal to the highest authority in Africa. The Kaiser has given the Vizekönig a sacred trust. In Africa, the Vizekönig's word is the same as the Kaiser's."
MAF_Four_Year_Plan:0 "Four Year Plan"
MAF_Four_Year_Plan_desc:0 "Trouble is brewing in Europe and Asia, the syndicalists grow bolder every day while our own military has become complacent. We must plan a timetable for our economy and military to ensure that we are ready to support the Fatherland in any way possible."
MAF_Die_Volkerschau:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau"
MAF_Die_Volkerschau_desc:0 "Building on the techniques of Carl Hagenbeck in the early 20th century, we can put together the world's greatest (and most profitable) ethnological exposition in the world. With over 1,000 performers, it will be sure to bring in a profit, while still serving the public diplomacy of our administration."
MAF_Protect_Animals:0 "Protected Endangered Species"
MAF_Protect_Animals_desc:0 "It's incredulous to think, but some of the most iconic species of Africa, particularly the lion, are in danger of being totally exterminated, as the wolf was from Europe. In 1870, the last Atlas Bear was shot by hunters. Our Statthalter has a particular interest in pushing laws that ensure this will not happen to our native species."
MAF_Kulturkampf:0 "A Second Kulturkampf"
MAF_Kulturkampf_desc:0 "In the 1870s, the German Parliament passed 22 laws to curb the power of the Catholic Church. By ruthlessly enforcing these laws, we can curb foreign elements, and also ensure the monopoly of our own secular and German education system."
MAF_Proving_Grounds:0 "Swapokmund Proving Grounds"
MAF_Proving_Grounds_desc:0 "To train our most capable administrators and public servants, we send them to the Namibian desert for a week of harsh training and research where they are forced to rely on all the skills they have learnt so far to command a small desert settlement. While this does cause a few deaths a year, it makes our administration among the best trained in the world."
MAF_Army_Reforms:0 "Reform the Army"
MAF_Army_Reforms_desc:0 "The African Askari in 1914 was up to the standard of the contemporary European soldier. Today, he is still up to the standard of 1914. He is not ready for the kind of mechanised, artillery intensive battles we saw in Europe by the end of the war. We must fix this."
MAF_Long_Range_Airforce:0 "A Long Range Air Force"
MAF_Long_Range_Airforce_desc:0 "Africa is far from the major theatres of war. In order to engage our enemies, we must construct a fleet of long range bombers capable of even transoceanic voyages. Even if we never use it, our ability to project air power across the Indian and Atlantic oceans will greatly improve our prestige."
MAF_Heavy_Equipment:0 "Heavy Equipment"
MAF_Heavy_Equipment_desc:0 "If our military is to match the standards of Germany, we shall need equipment: tanks, planes, artillery guns, these are the weapons of modern war!"
MAF_Africa_Army:0 "The Africa Divisions"
MAF_Africa_Army_desc:0 "Now that we have achieved parity in modern warfare, it is not enough for our Askari to serve as a colonial police force. Like the Gurkhas for the British, and Senegalese for the French, the best of the native populace will serve as shock troops for the German army."
MAF_Strategic_Export:0 "Strategic Resources Export"
MAF_Strategic_Export_desc:0 "In the event of war, Mittelafrika must serve to feed the great German war machine. Expanding our production of strategic resources will ensure we can outproduce our enemies and strengthen the Fatherland."
MAF_African_Breadbasket:0 "The African Breadbasket"
MAF_African_Breadbasket_desc:0 "Much of Africa has little in the way of agricultural development, but what we do have is invested in cash crops suitable only for the tropics. The last Weltkrieg showed that Germany is vulnerable to its lack of foodstuffs, and so by focusing on staples such as corn and rice, rather than tobacco and pepper, we can help ensure victory."
MAF_African_War_Industries:0 "African War Industries"
MAF_African_War_Industries_desc:0 "African labourers will work for far less than the average German, if we pay them at all. It makes sense therefore to encourage the development of simple manufacturing processes suitable to Africa instead."
MAF_War_Economy:0 "A War Economy"
MAF_War_Economy_desc:0 "War is inevitable, and time is precious. In the Weltkrieg, we gained a great advantage by mobilising faster than the British in Africa. We must be the first to mobilise in the next war as well."
MAF_Start_Heydrich_Reforms:0 "Start Heydrich Reforms"
MAF_Start_Heydrich_Reforms_desc:0 "In order to be of use to our Fatherland, our naval facilities must be expanded to accommodate larger ships, even battleships and aircraft carriers."
MAF_Cont_Heydrich_Reforms:0 "Continue Heydrich Reforms"
MAF_Cont_Heydrich_Reforms_desc:0 "By purchasing vessels from German shipyards, and purchasing antiquated vessels from the Kaiserliche Marine, we can stimulate the German economy and strengthen our own naval industry at the same time."
MAF_Final_Heydrich_Reforms:0 "Finalise the Heydrich Reforms"
MAF_Final_Heydrich_Reforms_desc:0 "With the proper investment, we can establish naval dockyards of our own, and contribute to any new naval arms race."
MAF_Sailing_With_Marine:0 "Sailing With the Kaiserliche Marine"
MAF_Sailing_With_Marine_desc:0 "Our vessels should not simply patrol local waters. We should send them sailing from Kiel to Tsingtau on exercises with the Kaiserliche Marine."
MAF_Back_To_Basics:0 "Back to the Basics"
MAF_Back_To_Basics_desc:0 "Our administration draws from over 50 years of experience on the Dark Continent. Undefeated against impossible odds in the Weltkrieg, we understand that Africa is very different from Europe, and are aware of our limitations. This is our strength, not our weakness!"
MAF_Royal_Tours:0 "Royal Tours"
MAF_Royal_Tours_desc:0 "In Africa we mostly rule through local intermediaries, Kings and Chieftains whose rule we back with iron authority. We can use them to help modernise from the ground up, while also integrating them better into the empire by introducing them to the society of Kings, Dukes and other Royalty that makes up our larger empire."
MAF_Honorary_Officers:0 "Honorary Officers"
MAF_Honorary_Officers_desc:0 "The core of our authority are the Askari, who obey without question, and the local authorities who can effectively administrate our territories. We should blend the two by adopting Kings and Chieftains as honorary officers in our armed forces."
MAF_African_Studies:0 "Promote African Studies in Germany"
MAF_African_Studies_desc:0 "The official language of our administration is Swahili, but there are few opportunities to learn it elsewhere, not to mention the hundreds of other native languages used in Africa. To have a steady supply of competent administrators, we should encourage German universities to train specialists in African languages and cultures."
MAF_Bezirk:0 "Bezirksleiterrecht"
MAF_Bezirk_desc:0 "Much of the law that ordinary Africans operate and face trial under is not German law, but local tribal laws, arbitrated by tribal leaders and elders. Rather than trying to stamp it out and flood our limited number of acceptable judges, lawyers and jurors, Rudolf Asmis has proposed we have teams of legal experts consult with the locals to put into writing and modernise their local laws."
MAF_Strategic_Reserve:0 "Strategic Resources Reserve"
MAF_Strategic_Reserve_desc:0 "In the last war, cut off from Germany, we had to improvise our own supplies. We found ways to manufacture torpedoes, artillery shells, dyes, liquors and foodstuffs out of practically nothing. We should perpetuate this tradition, and find ways to improvise the manufacture of goods if we are cut off from the Fatherland again."
MAF_Cash_Crops:0 "Cash Crops Exports"
MAF_Cash_Crops_desc:0 "It is no secret that the quest for exotic goods has always been a driver of imperialism. Many tropical crops can grow in the Sub-Saharan environment such as coffee and cocoa. We should focus on these rather than staples, importing food from Ukraine or East Prussia to make up for any imbalances."
MAF_East_Asian_Exports:0 "East Asian Exports"
MAF_East_Asian_Exports_desc:0 "We are only a part of Germany's vast colonial empire. We should make sure our trade doesn't only go to the metropole, but takes advantage of opportunities in the Orient."
MAF_Cottage_Industries:0 "Cottage Industries"
MAF_Cottage_Industries_desc:0 "It's strange to think, but even in the 20th century a great deal of work can be done by distributing work to the vast numbers of skilled Africans throughout the continent, many of them traditionally trained blacksmiths, in order to increase our production."
MAF_African_Army:0 "An African Army"
MAF_African_Army_desc:0 "We should never forget that our Askari are trained to secure and defend Africa. To this end, we require light infantry capable of operating in the brush and jungle on low supply."
MAF_Airforce_Infantry:0 "Establish the Air Mobile Infantry"
MAF_Airforce_Infantry_desc:0 "Ludwig von Bockholt, one of the main members of the DKG administration, has always been a daring innovator in air combat. His newest innovation: aerial deployment and resupply of full divisions."
MAF_Improve_Logistics:0 "Improve our Logistics"
MAF_Improve_Logistics_desc:0 "During the Weltkrieg, we required over 200,000 porters to supply a force of only 18,000 soldiers. This drained our food supplies and reduced our mobility to the rate at which humans can carry artillery. We cannot allow this to happen again."
MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck:0 "The Spirit of von Lettow-Vorbeck"
MAF_Spirit_Vorbeck_desc:0 "The most important lesson of the Weltkrieg cannot be found in any technical manual. It is exemplified in the sheer determination of General von Lettow-Vorbeck to continue fighting no matter how dire the situation might have appeared. In 1916, the Entente declared the situation in Africa over. In 1921 we were still standing, and still fighting. We never gave up, and we never will!"
MAF_Electronic_Project:0 "Electronic Intelligence Project"
MAF_Electronic_Project_desc:0 "Mittelafrika is not suited for a large navy, our shores are too large to protect and our industry would be better spent on other things. One such other thing is investment in electronics technology, which will give us the ability to project power from Africa and help our Fatherland through intelligence gathering."
MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners:0 "The Königsberg Gunners"
MAF_Konigsburg_Gunners_desc:0 "The Weltkrieg did not see much naval warfare in Africa, aside from some lake battles using improvised steamers. The key battle was the Battle of the Rufiji Delta, where the SMS Königsberg was severely damaged. However, the crew salvaged the guns before scuttling the ship, and served as artillery and infantry officers. Given such unique experiences, it is no wonder that some of our naval officers, such as Richard Wenig, have become experts in naval infantry tactics."
MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation:0 "Naval Aerial Observation"
MAF_Naval_Aerial_Observation_desc:0 "Building on the strength of standing astride many naval lanes, we should improve on our observation and interdiction ability with naval aircraft. Previously, these operations were conducted via dirigibles commanded by Commodore Bockholt, but advances in technology mean long range aircraft and flying boats are now the key. Conventional German naval aircraft are designed with the rather short ranges of the North Sea in mind. We must develop our facilities to modify planes to suit our own needs."
MAF_Our_Shipyards:0 "Our Own Shipyards"
MAF_Our_Shipyards_desc:0 "Our current policy of adapting and refitting outdated ships from the Kaiserliche Marine is both costly and ineffective. The ships we receive are too slow for modern vessels and are in frequent need of costly repairs. Instead of large, rusting cruisers, we should be focusing on state of the art destroyers and U-Boats to keep our operating costs low."
MAF_African_Landtag:0 "An African Landtag"
MAF_African_Landtag_desc:0 "Rather than all power residing in the Statthalter, we shall have two branches of legislature, a Harrenhause made up of German noblemen and African kings, and a Abgeordnetenhaus, decided on by mainly white voters."
MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe:0 "Reform the Schutztruppe"
MAF_Reform_Schutztruppe_desc:0 "For too long our Schutztruppe have operated in military fashion despite not being part of the German military. Though they displayed outstanding bravery during the Weltkrieg, they are a police force, not an occupying army. It's time they acted like it."
MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms:0 "Autonomous Kingdoms"
MAF_Autonomous_Kingdoms_desc:0 "Some areas of Africa are not suitable for white settlement, and our rule is particularly dependent on the good will of local rulers. Rather than trying to coordinate, we should grant them greater independence and autonomy, though naturally with ourselves as suzerain."
MAF_Restore_British_Selfrule:0 "Restore British Self Rule"
MAF_Restore_British_Selfrule_desc:0 "Integrating the British into our parliament is a nightmare. They do not have German citizenship, so they cannot vote, but the British have a deep love of parliamentarianism and shall resent their comparative privileges. We should instead restore some measure of self rule to these people, as part of our trusteeship to restore responsible government to these territories."
MAF_Hold_Elections:0 "Hold Elections"
MAF_Hold_Elections_desc:0 "It is time to hold Mittelafrika's first ever elections. They shall commence in about half a year, after all the parties have had time to campaign."
MAF_Deal_With_Europeans:0 "Deal with the Europeans"
MAF_Deal_With_Europeans_desc:0 "The Belgian and British citizens of our colony are very disproportionally influential, and it is time we deal with them one way or another."
MAF_Block_FW_Investment:0 "Block Flemish Investment"
MAF_Block_FW_Investment_desc:0 "For too long the Flemish and Walloons have played a disproportionately large role in the economy of our colony. We should take measures to ensure only German companies have access to these opportunities."
MAF_Seize_FW_Industries:0 "Seize Flemish Industries"
MAF_Seize_FW_Industries_desc:0 "Now that we've broken the power of Flemish-Walloon capital, their investors are eager to leave. We can seize upon any excuse we want to claim their industries as our own, or purchase them for a paltry sum."
MAF_Expel_Alien_Nationals:0 "Expel Alien Nationals"
MAF_Expel_Alien_Nationals_desc:0 "Unlike the British, the Flemish-Walloons rarely come here to settle. Most of them are technicians and skilled labourers who work here and then simply return to Europe to be later replaced by their fellow countrymen. Therefore, it is much easier to simply deport them back to Flanders-Wallonia."
MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment:0 "Attract Flemish Investment"
MAF_Attract_Belgian_Investment_desc:0 "The Flemish-Walloons have been here long before us as a colonial power, and they've never really left. We have a comfortable and working relationship with numerous mining firms who have actually expanded beyond their original holdings in the Kongo. If we continue this policy, we can reap the benefits of their capital."
MAF_Grant_Cons_FW:0 "Flemish Resource Companies"
MAF_Grant_Cons_FW_desc:0 "By granting the Flemish-Walloon conglomerates autonomy and security rights over remote stretches of the Congo, we can ensure a more disciplined workforce."
MAF_Intergrate_FW:0 "Integrate Flemish Officers"
MAF_Intergrate_FW_desc:0 "We fought against them in the Weltkrieg, but now the people of Flanders and Wallonia are our allies. Many of their officers have experience with commanding troops in Africa. We can use them."
MAF_Deal_With_Belgians:0 "Deal with the Flandro-Wallonians"
MAF_Deal_With_Belgians_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the Flandro-Wallonians and their ACC, it is time to make our arrangement with them permanent."
MAF_Disarm_Anglos:0 "Disarm the Anglo Security Forces"
MAF_Disarm_Anglos_desc:0 "Even before our arrival, the British populations of Kenya and Northern Rhodesia worked to ensure their security through 'rifle clubs', auxiliary police associations and paramilitaries. Participation rates have increased since our occupation, and so we must break up these groups if we are to truly rule the British territories."
MAF_Remove_Brit_Service:0 "Remove the British from the Civil Service"
MAF_Remove_Brit_Service_desc:0 "Positions in the former British colonies are often staffed by Swahili-speaking Britons. We should endeavour to drive them out and fully Germanise the administration."
MAF_German_Education_Brits:0 "German Education for the Children"
MAF_German_Education_Brits_desc:0 "Growing off the base of our colony in East Africa, the official language of our administration is Swahili, not German. This has allowed the British to maintain the use of their original languages by using Swahili only when dealing with our administration. By instituting mandatory German education, we can Germanise the British population."
MAF_Support_Anglos:0 "Officially Support the Anglo Security Forces"
MAF_Support_Anglos_desc:0 "While some may see the militarisation of the British settlers as a threat, we see it as an opportunity. A large armed, conservative and white population can reinforce our rule and protect against native uprisings. We should grant our official blessing to these organisations."
MAF_Intergrate_Anglos:0 "Integrate the Anglo Security Forces"
MAF_Intergrate_Anglos_desc:0 "We can reduce discontent in our British trusteeships by offering their officers commissions in our forces at an equivalent rank. They will feel less like a subject population, and we get a wealth of well trained officers."
MAF_Canadian_Volunteers:0 "Canadian Volunteers"
MAF_Canadian_Volunteers_desc:0 "While we have integrated the British into our forces, some more patriotic members are eager to retake their home island. Since we're co-belligerents against the socialists, we should encourage them, and allow the training of a few divisions for front line duty."
MAF_Deal_With_British:0 "Deal with the British"
MAF_Deal_With_British_desc:0 "Now that we have dealt with the British and their RVA, it is time to make our arrangement with them permanent."
MAF_Black_Monday:0 "Black Monday Adjustment"
MAF_Black_Monday_desc:0 "In light of this unprecedented economic crisis, we can expect all kinds of economic setbacks..."
MAF_Float_Mark:0 "Float the Mark"
MAF_Float_Mark_desc:0 "Since 1921, our colony has printed its own currency, the Afrikan Mark, which has been pegged to the German Mark. By allowing our currency to float, we can reduce the price of our exports, and return revenue to normal."
MAF_Fiscal_Austerity:0 "Fiscal Austerity"
MAF_Fiscal_Austerity_desc:0 "Times are tough and we must all tighten our belts, it is time to introduce a pay cut to all Mittelafrikan employees."
MAF_1937_Budget:0 "1937 Budget"
MAF_1937_Budget_desc:0 "As 1937 dawns, we must prepare an austere budget, one that foresees little spending and growth outside of vital areas."
MAF_1938_Budget:0 "1938 Budget"
MAF_1938_Budget_desc:0 "For 1938, we have prepared to make up for lost growth, and to undertake some development projects impossible in 1937."
MAF_University_Kinshala:0 "The University of Kinshasa"
MAF_University_Kinshala_desc:0 "A new university on our western coast will foster technological growth."
MAF_1939_Budget:0 "1939 Budget"
MAF_1939_Budget_desc:0 "1939 sees the world in flames, we must adjust our budget towards war."
MAF_Post_War_Budget:0 "1940 Budget"
MAF_Post_War_Budget_desc:0 "The worst is behind us and we can now enter a new era of economic growth."
MAF_Cape_Cairo:0 "The Cape to Cairo Railway"
MAF_Cape_Cairo_desc:0 "It is time to finish what the British started, the Cape to Cairo Railroad will lead to massive economic growth across the continent."
MAF_Tanzania_Uganda:0 "Tanganjika to Uganda"
MAF_Tanzania_Uganda_desc:0 "To finish the Cape to Cairo railroad, we must connect Tanganjika and Uganda."
MAF_Kampala_Khartoum:0 "Kampala to Khartoum"
MAF_Kampala_Khartoum_desc:0 "The final step in the Cape to Cairo railroad lies in the Sudan, we must connect Kampala to Khartoum."
MAF_Connect_Addis:0 "Kampala to Addis Abbaba"
MAF_Connect_Addis_desc:0 "It is time to expand the Cape to Cairo railroad by connecting it to Ethiopia, opening up a new route for trade in Africa."
MAF_Industrial_Development:0 "Industrial Development"
MAF_Industrial_Development_desc:0 "With our new budget in place, we are able to develop the industries of Mittelafrika."

mittel.1.t:0 "The Mozambique Situation"
mittel.1.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while we occupied Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war we had to punish those who joined the Entente's side. Now, many of those natives are displaced across the Mozambique border and there are many rumours that the new extremist government in Portugal is planning to arm them against us."
mittel.1.a:0 "We must prepare."
mittel.2.t:0 "The Mozambique Situation"
mittel.2.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while the Germans occupied our Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war the Huns led cruel reprisal attacks on the natives that joined our side. Since then, thousands of those natives have fled over the border into Mozambique where they now live in camps. These natives are a good opportunity to sow mischief in Mittelafrika, as many of them still want revenge for what the Huns did to them."
mittel.2.a:0 "Let's draw up a plan..."
mittel.3.t:0 "A Chance For Mischief in Our Rightful Territories"
mittel.3.d:0 "There is a great opportunity for us to cause instability in Mittelafrika by arming angry displaced natives who live in camps in Mozambique. The more unstable Mittelafrika is, the better chance we have to retake our rightful territories shown in the Pink Map."
mittel.3.a:0 "Arm them as much as we can."
mittel.3.b:0 "Crack down on these hooligans."
mittel.4.t:0 "Police Shooting in Lusaka!"
mittel.4.d:0 "A Makonde tribesman has shot one of our police officers in Lusaka! The city is still in shock and the perpetrator, along with any supporters, is now being detained for investigation by the local police. It has been theorised that he had acquired the weapons from across the border, in Portugal's colonies."
mittel.4.a:0 "Terrible!"
mittel.5.t:0 "Another Police Officer Has Been Shot!"
mittel.5.d:0 "Another Policeman, this time from Lilongwe, has been shot by a radicalised native, who is a member of the Makonde tribe. The cause of his radicalisation and the source of his weapons are still being investigated, however it is possible that he had received them from Portugal."
mittel.5.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
mittel.6.t:0 "A Third Police Officer Has Been Shot!"
mittel.6.d:0 "Tragedy has struck Daressalam! Yet again, for the third time, a police officer has been shot: this time by a member of the Makonde tribe. The Daressalam police are now searching for the murderer and the cause of the attack; Portuguese involvement is suspected."
mittel.6.a:0 "Surely this cannot continue!?"
mittel.7.t:0 "Njassaland Plantation Burned!"
mittel.7.d:0 "A cashew plantation in Njassaland has been burned down by 'bandits' operating from across the Portuguese border. They've taken as much as they could of the recently harvested crop, burned the rest down and escaped back into Portuguese Mozambique."
mittel.7.a:0 "Something must be done about this!"
mittel.8.t:0 "Military Depot Raided!"
mittel.8.d:0 "The 'bandits' don't ever fear the famous might of our Askari any more! They have raided and stolen supplies from one of our military depots and escaped with the supplies back to their camp in Mozambique."
mittel.8.a:0 "Portugal must put an end to this!"
mittel.9.t:0 "The Portuguese Question"
mittel.9.d:0 "We should launch a formal complaint against Portugal. The continued existence of these 'bandit' camps possess a clear threat to our colony. If they cannot deal with a few bandits, they're clearly not fit to be a colonial power."
mittel.9.a:0 "Summon the Portuguese Consul! We will deal with this ourselves!"
mittel.9.b:0 "We shall take this all the way to Berlin!"
mittel.10.t:0 "The Portuguese-Mittelafrika Dispute"
mittel.10.d:0 "Our Mittelafrikan Statthalter has come to us with a request for aid, he speaks of Portugal supporting bandits that murder German and Afrikan police and endanger our rule in Afrika, what should we do?"
mittel.10.a:0 "Our relations with Portugal are too important, tell them to stand down."
mittel.10.b:0 "We shall take up the matter with Portugal ourself!"
mittel.11.t:0 "The Kaiser Refuses"
mittel.11.d:0 "The Kaiser has refused to help us, telling us to stand down and to stop ruining German relations with Portugal. We cannot expect any help from Berlin."
mittel.11.a:0 "We have no choice but to follow the Kaiser's instructions."
mittel.11.b:0 "Ignore him! We will deal with this on our own..."
mittel.1101.t:0 "Mittelafrika Ignored Us"
mittel.1101.d:0 "Our Mittelafrikan Statthalter had the nerve to ignore our instructions and has taken up the issue with the Portuguese Consul directly. This is nothing short of an outrage, treason, mutiny!"
mittel.1101.a:0 "Cut their supplies, they can't be allowed to get away with this!"
mittel.1102.t:0 "The Kaiser Retaliates"
mittel.1102.d:0 "The Kaiser has dropped our supply shipments and denounced our actions. We will certainty feel the pinch over the next few months."
mittel.1102.a:0 "Maybe this wasn't such a good idea..."
mittel.12.t:0 "The Germans Come Knocking"
mittel.12.d:0 "The Germans in Daressalam have come to their overlords in Berlin, and told them about our support of rebels in their territory, now Berlin demands we produce an explanation for our actions..."
mittel.12.a:0 "Explain the situation."
mittel.12.b:0 "We do not discuss internal affairs with foreign nations."
mittel.1201.t:0 "Portugal Denied Our Request"
mittel.1201.d:0 "The Portuguese government refused to 'discuss internal affairs with foreign nations', this is not on at all and we have send them a strongly worded letter reminded them of their duties to us."
mittel.1201.a:0 "An outrage!"
mittel.1201.b:0 "Unacceptable! Tell Mittelafrika they can deal with it!"
mittel.1202.t:0 "An Offer From Germany"
mittel.1202.d:0 "The Portuguese government has refused to 'discuss internal affairs' Germany and in retaliation the Kaiser has given us the green light to deal with this issue as we see fit."
mittel.1202.a:0 "Best to leave it."
mittel.1202.b:0 "A green light you say? Now is the time!"
mittel.13.t:0 "Portugal Offers an Explanation"
mittel.13.d:0 "The Portuguese Ambassador explained in great detail the chaotic situation in the Rumuva region..."
mittel.13.a:0 "Who knew Africa was so complicated, no matter, demand they step down immediately!"
mittel.14.t:0 "Foreign Office Declares the Matter Resolved"
mittel.14.d:0 "The Portuguese have been forced to step down by the Berlin government, looks like it was the right call to talk to them."
mittel.14.a:0 "Thank you Kaiser!"
mittel.1401.t:0 "We Must Step Down"
mittel.1401.d:0 "Having engaged with the German government about the issue, we have no choice but to follow their request and stand down with our attacks."
mittel.1401.a:0 "We will not forget this."
mittel.15.t:0 "Mittelafrika Threatens Our Colonies"
mittel.15.d:0 "The Germans in Daressalam have noticed our support of rebels in their territories, and are now demanding we crack down on the rebels or 'face consequences'. What should we do?"
mittel.15.a:0 "Excellent, perhaps we can avenge 1918!"
mittel.15.b:0 "We have no choice, disarm the Ruga-Ruga, by force if needed."
mittel.16.t:0 "Portugal Disarms the Rebels!"
mittel.16.d:0 "The Portuguese have disarmed the bandits they have been sending into our territory at great cost to their own colonial stability. This matter is now truly solved."
mittel.16.a:0 "Independent action pays off."
mittel.17.t:0 "Portugal Stands Against Us!"
mittel.17.d:0 "The Portuguese have refused to disarm the bandits they've been sending into our colonies, if we wish to stop this, we will have to take real action against Portugal..."
mittel.17.a:0 "Send in the troops, if they won't or can't clear out the bandits, we will."
mittel.17.b:0 "We can't make our move, yet...."
mittel.18.t:0 "Mittelafrika Stands Down"
mittel.18.d:0 "The German weaklings in Daressalam have stood down from stopping our bandit attacks, we can now freely continue these attacks as we please."
mittel.18.a:0 "Hah!"
mittel.19.t:0 "The Germans Cross the Border"
mittel.19.d:0 "The Germans have crossed the border into Mozambique to destroy the bandits, completely wrecking our national sovereignty. We must choose what to do."
mittel.19.a:0 "Repel them!"
mittel.19.b:0 "Stand down."
mittel.20.t:0 "Portugal Caves In!"
mittel.20.d:0 "The Portuguese have decided not to resist our troops during our raid into Mozambique, we now have military control of Mozambique and must decide our next action."
mittel.20.a:0 "Only occupation will bring peace."
mittel.20.b:0 "Burn down the camps and leave."
mittel.21.t:0 "Mittelafrika Seizes Northern Mozambique"
mittel.21.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have occupied yet another one of our rightful territories, Northern Mozambique has been seized by the Mittelafrikan soldiers that entered our territory."
mittel.21.a:0 "Damn them!"
mittel.22.t:0 "Mittelafrika Burns Down Camps!"
mittel.22.d:0 "The Mittelafrikan raid into our territory has ended, after burning down our bandit camps and slaughtering most of their inhabitants, their troops withdrew back into Mittelafrikan territory."
mittel.22.a:0 "That is the end of that."
mittel.23.t:0 "Mittelafrika's Proposal"
mittel.23.d:0 "A Mittelafrikan envoy has arrived, claiming that Portugal is a dangerously irresponsible administrator of its African colonies, and has proposed a secret compact to divide Mozambique between us if war breaks out between the two. We would get a good share of the spoils, which would be sure to please our land hungry Boer population, but the Anglophones look at Mittelafrika with suspicion and fear, while prefering Portugal as an ally. Drastic action at this point would be highly contentious, especially with the looming elections..."
mittel.23.a:0 "Consider all our options, stall for time."
mittel.23.b:0 "It's an opportunity we can't afford to turn down."
mittel.24.t:0 "Negotiations With South Africa"
mittel.24.d:0 "South Africa has stalled. The South Africans have refused to say no, but they won't commit, and won't even say what it is they want. We suspect that the South Africans don't want to make a momentous decision before their highly contested elections. The Boer population and their National Party favours our position and is pushing to sign the deal, while the English settlers and their Dominion Party favour the Portuguese. We should watch the upcoming elections closely, as victory or defeat for the Boers could decide this whole conflict."
mittel.24.a:0 "Fine we'll wait."
mittel.24.b:0 "The deal's off the table then"
mittel.25.t:0 "Mittelafrika Walks Out"
mittel.25.d:0 "The delegation from Mittelafrika has left the negotiations citing that the vague position of our own diplomats. With this they have also officially announced they are no longer supporting our claim to the lower portion of Mozambique and that they will not aid us in attempting to seize it."
mittel.25.a:0 "Oh well..."
mittel.26.t:0 "South Africa Accepts"
mittel.26.d:0 "Our friends in South Africa have accepted the deal, and have managed to push it through their parliament. With their support, Portugal will be unable to resist us. We should move to demand the partition of the Mozambique now."
mittel.26.a:0 "Send a man to Portugal, it's time to finish this."
mittel.27.t:0 "The Mittelafrikan-South African Alliance"
mittel.27.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have turned South Africa against us with promises of land in southern Mozambique. There is no way we can resist their combined forces, perhaps we must give Mozambique up..."
mittel.27.a:0 "Damn the Boers."
mittel.27.b:0 "War!"
mittel.28.t:0 "Portugal Surrenders Mozambique"
mittel.28.d:0 "The Portuguese have surrendered Mozambique as we had wanted, it is now time to fulfil our promises of partition with our friends in South Africa. The problems with Portugal are now over."
mittel.28.a:0 "God bless the Boers."
mittel.29.t:0 "We've Gained Southern Mozambique!"
mittel.29.d:0 "Our alliance with Mittelafrika has paid off, the Portuguese have surrendered Mozambique to Mittelafrika and they have given the southern part of it to us. What a great time for South Africa!"
mittel.29.a:0 "Hooray!"
mittel.30.t:0 "The Mittelafrikans Will Wait"
mittel.30.d:0 "Good news has reached us from Daressalam, the Mittelafrikan administration has agreed to wait until after the elections before pressing the volatile Mozambique issue any further, giving time for the Nationalists to consolidate their support and leave nothing to chance."
mittel.30.a:0 "Great news!"
mittel.31.t:0 "The National Party Wins the Civil War"
mittel.31.d:0 "The Boers have defeated their Anglo rivals in the South African civil war, effectively neutering them as a force in politics. It is now time to approach them again with our offer to split Mozambique, perhaps there will be a different reaction this time."
mittel.31.a:0 "Send another envoy."
mittel.32.t:0 "Mittelafrika Delegation Returns"
mittel.32.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have returned with the offer to split Mozambique with them, now that we have dealt with the Dominionists, we will be able to freely support Mittelafrika if we wish."
mittel.32.a:0 "Agree to the offer, it is time to take Mozambique."
mittel.32.b:0 "Decline, we must rebuild our divided nation."
mittel.33.t:0 "Returning the Portuguese Colonies"
mittel.33.d:0 "With our victory in the civil war, the time has come to return Mozambique to Portugal and arrange to have the Boer population that attempted to colonize the area returned to South Africa proper."
mittel.33.a:0 "Let's inform Madrid"
mittel.34.t:0 "South Africa Returns Mozambique!"
mittel.34.d:0 "Great news, an envoy from South Africa has arrived today informing us that they are in the process of dismantling their administration in Mozambique and will hand over the colony shortly."
mittel.34.a:0 "Hurray!"
mittel.35.t:0 "Integrating The New Colonies"
mittel.35.d:0 "Now that we have taken over part of the Mozambique colony we have been left with a hostile population that is not averse to attempting to destabilize the local authorities. It'll take some time but eventually we'll be able to integrate the colony into our system properly."
mittel.35.a:0 "Oh well."
mittel.36.t:0 "Asking South Africa For Help?""
mittel.36.d:0 "With the border raids escalating by the day and clear involvement of Portuguese involvement its time to press the offensive. To the South, the Boers have long eyed the lower portion of Mozambique. We could extent an offer of spoils if they partage in our war."
mittel.36.a:0 "Send an envoy!"
mittel.36.b:0 "We'd rather not involve them"
mittel.37.t:0 "The Assassination of Hans-Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck"
mittel.37.d:0 "Today, Hans-Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck, son of the famed general and first Statthalter of Mittelafrika Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, and promising officer in his own right, was shot to death in broad daylight in the city of Mbeya. The killer was of the Ngoni ethnic group, and was deported to Mozambique at the age of 4 along with his family after the execution of his father in 1921. He claims the assassination as vengeance for the death of his father, but we suspect he was at least given assistance by the Portuguese. A state funeral for Vorbeck and a military expedition are being prepared. and the old guard are crying out for blood. If we do not act now, when?"
mittel.37.a:0 "Declare war on Portugal! For vengeance!"
mittel.37.b:0 "It is too risky, we must hold back..."
mittel.37.c:0 "The pact Portugal has with South Africa holds us back, it is too dangerous..."
mittel.38.t:0 "Mittelafrika Declares War!"
mittel.38.d:0 "One of our operatives has murdered a high value target in Mittelafrika, out of sheer rage the Statthalter has declared an invasion of our territories. We must now defend them with our blood, war is upon us."
mittel.38.a:0 "Angola e Nossa!"
mittel.39.t:0 "Defeat in Africa"
mittel.39.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have defeated our forces in Africa, it may be time to surrender our colonies for now, let us see what it is Mittelafrika wants out of this war..."
mittel.39.a:0 "Send an envoy, we surrender."
mittel.39.b:0 "We shall never surrender!"
mittel.40.t:0 "The Portuguese Surrender"
mittel.40.d:0 "We have defeated the Portuguese in Africa, and they have started negotiations to surrender. It is now time to decide what it is we want to get out of this war. The old guard suggests we should take only northern Mozambique, as it was our original goal in this war. Members of the NKR suggest taking all of Mozambique or establishing security zones in Mozambique and Angola, while the most radical members of our administration say we should strip Portugal of all African holdings, what shall be done?"
mittel.40.a:0 "Listen to the old guard, take only northern Mozambique."
mittel.40.b:0 "Only taking all of Mozambique will ensure safety."

mittel.43.d:0 "An unusual case has reached the highest court in the German State. Anti-Colonial activist Jomo Kenyatta has brought a class action lawsuit against former Afrikan Statthalter Wilhelm Solf. The case has become something of an embarrassment, as some of the plaintiffs are veterans of the Weltkrieg, it can not be easily dismissed. They claim that Solf's administration harmed them through policies of illegal land seizures, and even abductions and torture, all done with Solf's knowledge and little legal basis. Quietly, the foreign office has explained to the government that such things are common and necessary in our colonial administration. They strongly urge we quash this motion."

mittel.44.d:0 "Disaster! We have been watching the litigation of Jomo Kenyatta for years with nervous anticipation, and now our worst fears have been realised. Former Statthalter Wilhelm Solf has been found liable for 'extralegal' actions taken as Statthalter. The damages were not ruinous to Solf, but it has opened a door, to theoretically limitless cases. Already, Statthalter von Göring has resigned in protest. In the aftermath, legal reform and a more 'normalised' governance of Africa is the only viable option, and the only person willing to take charge and implement these reforms is Theodor von Hassel, may God help him."

Fortunately, the defence lawyer Carl Schmitt produced a novel defence, that has established a new legal precedent: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception." The courts accepted this argument, that the Statthalter is the sovereign authority in Africa, and has the right to 'step outside' normal legal proceedings. This obviously has startling implications, and some members of our administration already eagerly anticipate a 'Sovereign Statthalter'."

mittel.46.t:0 "The Black Dossier"
mittel.46.d:0 "A group of anonymous officers and administrators in Mittelafrika have compiled documentation and evidence of illegal activity by Statthalter von Göring and presented it to the Cabinet. The evidence, if true, is very serious. According to what they allege, Statthalter von Göring has been using the generous state budget we have provided him with to buy off politicians throughout the Reichspakt in order to secure support for his administration, as well as demanding state officials pay into a slush fund. Even more darkly, it alleges with less evidence that von Göring and his loyalists gather information for blackmail against his own employees, has been involved in the kidnapping and intimidation of journalists, and even hiring assassins!"

He is both an accomplished author, with his best seller "Storm of Steel" and an educated entomologist, using his time in Africa to discover and document numerous species, while introducing our Askari to 'stormtrooper tactics'. Jünger broke with the German Army after a dispute carried through a series of articles published in military journals in the mid-20s.\n\nUnable to convince the General Staff to adopt his views, he took a transfer to Africa, where he was more free to implement his theories on the importance of psychology in modern warfare. A member of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Ernst Jünger will bring what he calls a "new spirit of adventure" to the colonisation of Africa, as well as help us reform our infantry tactics."

A former General and current politician, Ritter von Epp fought in the Herero uprising and the ensuing repression, and earned the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg. After the war, Chancellor Ludendorf appointed him as the first postwar governor of Kamerun. Returning to Germany after serving as governor for three years, Ritter von Epp turned to politics, funding the creation of several patriotic newspapers, and serving in the Bavarian chamber of Imperial Counsellors. Ritter von Epp has never tried to hide his close ties to the Ludendorf dictatorship, and remains an outspoken apologist for Ludendorf. He is a controversial, almost belligerent figure, but the Kaiser has decided a fighting man is what Africa needs.

He's also been active in politics, providing financial support to right-wing parties and newspapers. He breaks from the right however in his outspoken support for higher wages and benefits for workers. He believes, like Bismarck before him, that the threat of Socialism can be averted by assuring a decent standard of living for it's workers. Thyssen claims it has the added benefit that well paid workers can purchase more German-made products, stimulating the economy. Some are calling this model of paying workers high enough wages to purchase industrial output and ensure loyalty 'Thyssenism.' Frtitz Thyssen has long been associated with the Neue Kolonialregierung, with rumours circulating that he helped fund Hermann von Göring's rise in politics, or that he was involved in the financial slush fund alleged in the 'Black Dossier'. None of these allegations have been proven yet, and the Kaiser has appointed Thyssen to the position of Statthalter, with a special eye to increase mining output in the Congo."

The young commander Bockholt flew the Airship L 59 "Die Afrika-schiff" from Jamboli Airstation in Bulgaria to the Mahange plateau in Tanjanika, after a grueling 100 hour flight across the deserts of Egypt and Sudan. The voyage resupplied our armies in Afrika with new weapons, ammunition, and most critically, quinine, that helped keep our armies in good fighting order until the Peace with Honour. It was the only resupply of East Afrika during the war, and holds other distinctions such as the longest military flight record, and flying the first aerial resupply mission. Because the mission was a one-way trip, Buckholt served the rest of the war as a naval infantry officer in the East Afrikan Theatre. After the war, Commodore Bockholt continued to refine his aerial resupply tactics and equipment, creating air mobile and later paratrooper naval infantry units. Despite such an innovative spirit, he is one of the leading officers of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and proved to be a thorn in the side of Statthalter von Göring, clashing with him frequently on the direction, and command of Mittelafrika's Air Force. With Bockholt as our Statthalter, we can expect Mittelafrika to maintain world class aerial infantry."

He took command of the battles of Killamanjaro, Saliata Hill and Latema Nek, leading the troops to victory each time. After the war, he took divisional command, and put down rebellions in the Upper Kongo and Ruvuma Valley. In 1925, he would be the one to negotiate the entry of German troops into British East Africa, and conduct the occupation. Later, he would become commander of all armed forces in Mittelafrika.

His most notable, and controversial work has been with his policy of 'Bezirksleiterrecht,' a policy of legitimizing and formalizing local and tribal law, and giving district officers the power to defer to this law in place of German Law. This has had been tried in Samoa with some success in reducing conflict with the locals. With such a long history in Imperial and Foreign affairs, he naturally has a close relationship with the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and will favour their ideas in decision making.

In the Siege of the Mahenge, his group of sixty soldiers held off several thousand rebel attackers, winning him the Order of the Red Eagle. After the Maji Maji war, von Hassel left the Schutztruppe to found a coffee farm, but volunteered for service during the Weltkrieg. After the war, he returned to his coffee plantation, which has grown into one of the most successful in Tanjanika. Dissatisfied with the way settlers like him were treated, and helped into politics by his father in law, the politician Jacob Jebsen, Theodor von Hassel spent years agitating on behalf of settlers' rights to democratic representation, as well as economic and political rights.The Kaiser has seen this man represents the will of the white and educated native population of Africa, and has deemed him worthy of being Statthalter."

He is well respected for this reason and likely gave his blessing to the project. He is already quite old, and perhaps it will be easier and less suspicious to induce his retirement than to kill him.

The source of the leak is even more embarrassing than expected. Von Göring's own brother, Albert, is the source. He has been staying in Africa under the fake name 'Albert von Epstein' a name based off of the Göring family's Jewish doctor and godfather.

mittel.98.d:0 "During a royal tour of Germany, the young Chief Adam Sapi of the Wahehe people lodged an awkward request. During our subjugation of East Africa, their tribal leader Chief Mkwavinyika Munyigumba Mwamuyinga, conducted a campaign of military resistance against our rule for 8 long years. After his death, his head was cut off and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. As part of his tour, Chief Sapi requested to visit the museum and see the skull. He asks that it be returned with him to Tanganjika. The Wahehe have superstitions about the disposal of remains, and wish to give his skull an honourable burial."

mittel.99.d:0 "In a ceremony today in Kalenga, with a festive spirit, the Governor of Tanjanika returned the skull of Chief Mkwawa to the current Chief Adam Sapi of the Wahehe. Mkwawa was a fierce rebel during the early part of our rule of Africa. It took years to surround him, at which point he committed suicide to avoid capture. His skull was removed, and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. It has now been returned, as a sign of good will, to ensure the friendliness and cooperation of the Wahehe people."

mittel.100.d:0 "We've encountered a bit of a diplomatic faux pas. During one of his sponsored royal tours, Chief Adam Sepi of the Wahehe requested the return of his predecessor's skull, currently kept in the Bremen Anthropological Museum. The skull belongs to Chief Mkwawa, who was a rebel against German rule and beheaded by Commander Tom von Prince, who sent the skull to the Museum's collection. The Wahehe are very respectful of their ancestors, and believe that with the skull in such a disrespectful state, it is certain to anger the spirits. Unfortunately, the German government has refused the return of the skull as a matter of principle, creating discontent even beyond the Wahehe tribe."

mittel.102.d:0 "Because of the mismanagement of Mittelafrika, the chain of command has broken down throughout the continent. Warlords and local rulers now hold more power in most areas than the German administration. The complex network of alliances that once made up Mittelafrika have been thrown into chaos, as the entire continent heads to war. The capital of Daressalam has been seized by loyalist Askari to prevent it from falling to non-loyalist elements, while Südwestafrika has been seized by local German forces.

The British lost nearly 4,000 men in the operation, to a loss of less than 200 German Askari.\n\nThe battle paved the way to our invasion and conquest of Mozambique in 1918. Since 1922, it has been a state holiday in Mittelafrika.

Bernhard served for only three years, from 1907 to 1910, but he had an enormous influence on the development of the colony of German East Afrika, that would eventually form the core of Mittelafrika. It was his reforms that firmly established the first fully secular education system on the Afrikan continent, a legacy we have tried, with difficulty, to spread throughout Mittelafrika.

mittel.125.t:0 "The Kenyan Church"
mittel.125.d:0 "When we moved into British Territory in 1925, the British hold on the territory was dangerously weak after 7 years of warfare. In the same year British strikes coincided with a series of protests by the natives in British East Africa; the Church of Scotland Mission declared the practice of female circumcision banned for Christians, labelling it 'sexual mutilation of women'. For the dominant ethnic group of the region, the Kikuyu, the practice, which they call irua, is the 'conditio sine qua non' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion. They felt so strongly about this that it has caused a rupture within the Christian community in Kikuyuland. The Anglican Church quickly followed the Scottish Church in banning the practice, but in response, the Kikuyu have created their own 'African Churches'. They've established their own theological schools, which have become a hotbed of Kikuyu nationalism. At the same time, with the fall of Britain to socialism, there is a schism within the Anglican and Scottish churches themselves. In Canterbury Cathedral, the Union of Britain has declared Archbishop John Hobbis Harris as the head of worldwide Anglican communion, while in Ottawa the British Monarch has declared, under his authority as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang to be the head of the communion. The Scottish Kirk has seen a similar schism. It is impossible to tell for certain who any given Anglican minister believes is the real head of the church, and they might be listening to Archbishop Harris, who is a campaigner against imperialism in Africa."

mittel.127.t:0 "The Kenyan Highlands Settlement Policy"
mittel.127.d:0 "The Highlands of Kenya are one of the few areas of Africa suitable to white settlement. The rare combination of cool uplands combined with healthy soil creates a climate almost like that of Europe, and excellent for farming. It is no wonder that the land there is in high demand.\n\nUnfortunately, it's long been economically underused. The British settlers have proven more interested in establishing themselves as landholders and letting the native Kikuyu do the labour. If we opened the land up to small German farmers squeezed by the Junker estates, we could improve productivity and increase our influence on the region, but it would also make the land shortage even more intense."

mittel.128.t:0 "Land Crisis in the Kenyan Highlands"
mittel.128.d:0 "Allowing German settlement in the Highlands of Kenia has only exacerbated the problems in the region, as it has set off land speculation, with prices rising out of control, and conflicts and disputes breaking out over the demarcation of a few metres of land. To make matters worse, for the local Kikuyu tribes, a man is not considered an adult until he owns at least some land. There are tribal territories set aside for this, but they are massively overcrowded, with most of them owning no land and working on British plantations. Additionally, an increasing amount of land within the tribal areas is monopolised by the local chiefs. This land shortage is creating unrest on all sides."

Supposedly, they conduct 'magic rituals' under the cover of darkness, and swear oaths to kill white settlers. By killing Senior Chief Waruhiu, who had a body guard and was held in high esteem by our administration, they've demonstrated there's almost no one in the Kenian Highlands they couldn't kill, right now."

mittel.166.d:0 "It appears that our efforts in Africa have proven in the end to be little more than folly, as on all fronts forces from South Africa and Mittelafrika overrun our colonies. Mozambique itself has fallen into the hands of our foes and now our position on the continent appears increasingly tenuous."
mittel.166.a:0 "A complete catastrophe!"
mittel.167.t:0 "In the Heart of Africa"
mittel.167.d:0 "Born after the absorption of French and Belgian colonies, Mittelafrika is a massive swath of land, composed of cities, chiefdoms, kingdoms, farmlands, jungles, savannah, deserts and more; for it covers half of the Dark Continent. A complex web of treaties, agreements and tacit understandings, the colony, while stable, is remarkably unprofitable; something that the new man in charge, Hermann von Göring, and his men wish to change no matter the cost. But could that cost be too great for Mittelafrika to pay? And will the Kaiser allow von Göring to take such a risk?"
mittel.167.a:0 "Sounds exciting!"
mittel.168.t:0 "Defeat in Africa"
mittel.168.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have defeated our forces in Africa, it may be time to surrender our colonies for now, let us see what it is Mittelafrika wants out of this war..."
mittel.168.a:0 "Send an envoy, we surrender."
mittel.168.b:0 "We shall never surrender!"
mittel.169.t:0 "The Portuguese Surrender"
mittel.169.d:0 "We have defeated the Portuguese in Africa, and they have started negotiations for surrender, it now time to decide what it is we want to get out of this war. The old guard suggests we should take only northern Mozambique, as it was our original goal in this war. Members of the NKR suggest establishing security zones in Mozambique and Angola, while the most radical members of our administration say we should strip Portugal of all African holdings. We must remember that we will uphold our deal with the South Africans and grant them southern Mozambique, what shall be done?"
mittel.169.a:0 "Listen to the old guard, take northern Mozambique."
mittel.169.b:0 "Establish security zones in Mozambique and Angola."
mittel.169.c:0 "Portugal has forfeited their colonial holdings with their reckless behaviour, take it all!"
mittel.170.t:0 "Peace With Tanganyika?"
mittel.170.d:0 "We have been thrown off the mainland! While we may be safe here, our odds of retaking the land which is rightfully ours are small; maybe a peace offering would be a smart idea..."
mittel.170.a:0 "Offer peace."
mittel.170.b:0 "We shall fight on!"
mittel.171.t:0 "Zanzibar Offers Peace"
mittel.171.d:0 "Zanzibar has come to us offering a peace deal; we shall keep their territory on the mainland in return for an end to the fighting. What do we say?"
mittel.171.a:0 "A good deal that is."
mittel.171.b:0 "No deal!"
mittel.172.t:0 "Tanganyika Refuses Peace"
mittel.172.d:0 "Tanganyika has refused out peace offer; the war will go on."
mittel.172.a:0 "That is a shame..."
mittel.173.t:0 "Germany Accepts Goering...Just"
mittel.173.d:0 "Germany has begrudgingly accepted to drop the matter for now. Likely they thought it was not worth the trouble, nevertheless, many in our government are not happy and we have made enemies in Berlin this day. Still; we remain in power."
mittel.173.a:0 "Of course we are!"
mittel.174.t:0 "Victory Against Portugal"
mittel.174.d:0 "It appears the Portuguese could not withstand the might of our combined armies, having surrendered to Mittelafrika this morning."
mittel.174.a:0 "Excellent!"
mittel.176.t:0 "The 1937 Budget"
mittel.176.d:0 "Going into 1937, we face a difficult choice. Our economy wasn't strong in the first place, and Black Monday annihilated what manufacturing potential we had for the better part of last year. Going forward, we're going to have to choose to focus on military production or diverting our limited resources towards repairing the civilian economy instead."
mittel.176.a:0 "Focus on military buildup."
mittel.176.b:0 "A long-term investment makes more sense here."
mittel.178.t:0 "The 1938 Budget"
mittel.178.d:0 "Black Monday was two years ago, and yet its impact is still visible. The economy is slowly getting back on track, but we're in the same situation that we were before. Shall we focus on military or civilian matters in the budget this year?"
mittel.178.a:0 "Germany needs our army!"
mittel.178.b:0 "Push more resources towards improving our infrastructure."
mittel.179.t:0 "The 1939 Budget"
mittel.179.d:0 "The lost growth from the last three years of depression may never be recovered, but for the time being we're in a more stable position. Our economy--What's left of it, at least--Appears to be functioning at full capacity now."
mittel.179.a:0 "No compromises on production! We have much lost time to make up for."
mittel.180.t:0 "The 1940 Budget"
mittel.180.d:0 "War is good for business some say, others say it is bad for business. What can't be disputed is that our economy is doing well, the 1940 budget will provide resources and funding for years to come!"
mittel.180.a:0 "Let's make Germany proud!"
mittel.181.t:0 "The Sovereign Statthalter's Proclamation"
mittel.181.d:0 "This evening, Hermann Goring addressed the entirety of Mittelafrika in a broadcast speech through the radio, with copies quickly finding their way throughout the entire continent. What began as a formal, typical address quickly took a change in tone, with the Statthalter abruptly denouncing the "damaging particularist elements" in the continent. The speech ended with an official proclamation: All treaties, titles, and privileges held by the African kingdoms and their subjects are now "unconditionally forfeit", with all former holders of titles expected to swear an oath of loyalty within the week. This marks a sharp turn in Mittelafrikan colonial policy, and is sure to have serious implications. We've stopped receiving communications from most of the continent, presumably as they protest..."
mittel.181.a:0 "It's time to instil some order, whether they like it or not!"
mittel.182.t:0 "Afrika Goes Quiet"
mittel.182.d:0 "Something is wrong. Very wrong. We're no longer hearing back from border garrisons. Supply convoys are being raided at an alarming rate. Many native elements of our troops are deserting, and we still haven't heard a thing from the dependencies. The atmosphere is tense like it never has been before."
mittel.182.a:0 "This doesn't look good..."
mittel.184.t:0 "Peace in Afrika?"
mittel.184.d:0 "Somehow, Goring's insane scheme has worked. Against all odds, the Askari of the Mittelafrikan government have crushed the rebels and enforced a harsh peace upon the colony. The damage from the chaos is severe, but the position of the Sovereign Statthalter has never been stronger."
mittel.184.a:0 "Was there ever any doubt in Goring's leadership?"
mittel.185.t:0 "Our Colonial Administration"
mittel.185.d:0 "With [MAF.GetNameDef] still possessing the rights to administer our colonies in Mittelafrika, our newly-gained holdings there should be transferred to their control."
mittel.185.a:0 "It's the sensible thing to do, yes."
mittel.186.t:0 "African Colonies Reclaimed"
mittel.186.d:0 "Following the dramatic and total collapse of Mittelafrika, we have brought our former African colonies back into our nation. While we never got official permission to do this, the Mittelafrikan government was hardly in a position to contest. In fact, such is the chaos, we haven't received any official complaints of any kind. This is nothing but sweet justice for the theft that removed them from us in the first place."
mittel.186.a:0 "Justice is served!"
mittel.187.t:0 "[892.GetName] Is Ours"
mittel.187.d:0 "Following the dramatic and total collapse of Mittelafrika, we have brought [892.GetName] back into our nation. While we never got official permission to do this, the Mittelafrikan government was hardly in a position to contest. In fact, such is the chaos, we haven't received any official complaints of any kind."
mittel.187.a:0 "Wonderful!"
mittel.188.t:0 "A Radical Change in Course?"
mittel.188.d:0 "Now that we no longer have to answer to Germany, we can finally take our Legacy as rulers of this continent. Supreme Leader Göring, who is the King of Mittelafrika in all, but name can finally take up his mantle as King of all of Afrika. However, some within our government advise against this radical move. However, the Supreme Leader does not often have his will ignored, and any who advise against this could be dealt with. As well, declaring Göring King would anger many, including the local tribes who have their own monarchies and the British who are loyal to the British King. Should Göring make himself the true, unchallenged ruler of Afrika?"
mittel.188.a:0 "On second thought..."
mittel.188.b:0 "Long live the King of Afrika!"
mittel.189.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.189.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Generaloberst Erwin Rommel as our new Statthalter. During the Weltkreig he served in Italy and was awarded the Pour le Mérite. He Served in the infantry, though he would later come to identify with a much more powerful form of warfare, Armoured Warfare. This however gained him many enemies within the High Command, who wanted to keep Germany practicing more traditional forms of warfare. After he published a renowned book on warfare, the Kaiser sent him to Africa to keep him out of the way of the High Command. However, this only strengthened his position in the high command as his doctrine of armoured warfare was perfectly suited the vast African plains. And now, with the Statthalter gone Rommel has been primed to take charge over Mittelafrika, and with him in Charge Mittelafrika’s warfare will be brought into the modern age. "
mittel.189.a:0 "It's time for a return to the Old Ways."

MAF_Colonial_Nation_desc:0 "Despite its very limited autonomy in dealings with African neighbours, such as Somalia, Mittelafrika is a colony; its entire state apparatus hinging on and maintained by German power, a budget prepared in Berlin, and its currency pegged to the German Mark.\n§RNOTE:§! Despite not being a subject, Mittelafrika is still subservient to Berlin's Authority and cannot declare independent wars"

MAF_Debt:0 "Tremendous Debt"
MAF_Debt_desc:0 "Despite having access to the vast resources of all German colonial holdings combined with all French Sub-Saharan colonies, Mittelafrika has been massively in debt for years. The 1925 British revolution saw us embark on several large-scale interventions to secure the protection of Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia without much thought being put in how to budget for it all. Our employees are underpaid and their employees in turn recieve even less, much to the detriment of the Deutsch-Kolonialgesellschaft and Heinrich Schnee. The Neue Kolonialregierung promises a radical new approach to resolve this issue and Goering continues to be a thorn in our side, so unless we find a solution to this soon our legitimacy is constantly being undercut because of it."

MAF_Missing_Funds_desc:0 "Significant amounts of funds are missing from our treasury. While it would take a large-scale corruption investigation to pinpoint the culprit, all signs point to Hermann von Goering and his Souverainisten. We don't know what Goering plans to do with all these Reichsmarks, §Rbut whatever it is, it could prove to be disastrous in the future.§!\n"
MAF_old_new_guard_divide:0 "The Rift Between the Old Guard and the Young Officers Clique"
MAF_old_new_guard_divide_desc:0 "Long has the Kaiserreich now held a stake in Africa, first obtaining Westafrika, Südwestafrika, and Kamerun in 1884 at the Berlin Conference. In the decades that have followed, the Kaiser’s ambitions have only grown and now, after the Weltkrieg and its wake, the Iron Cross of Germany looms over two-thirds of the continent. Since its inception, a loyal clique of staunchly monarchist generals and bureaucrats have stood as the scions of this new colonial realm, in the form of the DKG. \n\nAs the years have passed however, these aging veterans and relics of a year long passed have only gotten older, and with it, their grip over Africa has slipped - a fact sharply shown in their need to form a soft ruling coalition with elements of the Reformgrüppe shortly after Germany’s victory in the Weltkrieg. \n\nIn the aftermath of this necessary decision, the NKG - a rival group of aging, hawkish colonial administrators mixed with various elements of the less radical younger officers - broke off from the DKG to form their own clique poised to take the position of Staathalter for themselves. This syncretic clique of both young and old officers seeks to centralize and further Germanize Mittelafrika, but their goals are far from extremist or radical in nature. That dubious honor goes to the Young Officers Clique, who have increasingly become called the ‘Souveränisten’. Consisting of various disillusioned Mittelafrican youth officers who joined the colonial service to further the Pride of the Fatherland only to have the dark and decayed nature of Mittelafrika revealed to them and led, though unofficially, by Hermann Goering, these ‘Souveränisten’ are a menace to Mittelafrikan stability. \n\nThis divide between a dying Old Guard falling to various flavors of young officer and civilian movements form the basis of Mittelafrica’s internal political divisions today, and if they do not get a grip on the situation soon, the stalking opportunists like the integrated French, the autonomous Anglos, and even the evermore-angry natives may seize on their chance to strike during the chaos."

From our Askari and ground troops to our navy and airforce, each and every facet of our armed forces are now controlled and dictated by the NKR and their loyal officers, generals, and admirals.

As the Kolonialgesellshaft owes a great deal to the Neue Kolonialclique and the Souverainisten for their quick and decisive independent action, it remains a fact that we did nothing when they moved on our behalf. This fact has been empowering both of them ever since, despite the sizable portion of the budget that we now have to devote to maintaining our grip on the British territories being on their heads as well.

### Leader Bios ###
POLITICS_GOERING_DESC:0 "Hermann von Göring is an ambitious man, combining charm, cunning and ruthlessness to get what he want. An outstanding pilot during the Weltkrieg, he ended the war with more than 20 aerial victories, which earned him the numerous decorations he proudly wear. Von Göring, desiring above all power and wealth, embarked on a political career after the war, joining the Deutsche Vaterlandspartei. In 1923, following an unfortunate accident, he developed an addiction to morphine, which did not prevent him from leading his party to a score of 8% in the 1928 elections. His natural charm allowed him to make many friends, especially among rich industrialists, which made him one of the most influential men in Germany. He was sent to Mittelafrika by Wilhelm II himself, with the aim of distancing him from central power. He gladly accepted the Kaiser's offer, seeing Mittelafrika as a means of increasing his prestige with the aim of one day becoming chancellor of Germany. Now ruling Africa with an iron fist, having surrounded himself with loyal allies such as Heydrich, Von Epp and a group of young officers who are personally loyal to him, nothing seems to be able to stop von Göring, who intend to put his power and his connections at the service of Germany, and of course his personal interests. Homewer, some fears that Goering's reign might end up like his father's in Sudwestafrika, wondering if he is the right man to stabilize the inherently unstable Mittelafrika."
POLITICS_WARLORD_GOERING_DESC:0 "Hermann Göring had seen a lot in his time, but perhaps the most profound experience of his life was the collapse of Mittelafrika. Now, he had the power he always craved. Now, he had control of more resources than most men could ever imagine. However, Göring was not content to sit on what he was given. Instead, he has decided to make something of these circumstances. Göring has begun the work of transforming his territory into what he calls "Goeringia", a realm in which his word is gospel and every whim is followed. This will be no easy task though: the economy is crumbling, the natives complain about their sixteen hour work days, and Göring's rivals crowd around him. With his old friends in German industry and his new ones in the African drug trade, though, Göring is confident he has the talent and resources he needs to overcome all of these threats. One day, the world might even see a new Mittelafrika...."
POLITICS_VORBECK_DESC:0 "Where does one even begin with the Lion of Afrika? Born in 1870 on the Prussian Rhine, Born into minor Pomeranian nobility, Paul Von Lettow-Vorbeck was destined to be an army man. Joining in 1890 as a lieutenant, Vorbeck saw action in China during the Boxer Rebellion during 1900 and was later assigned to German Southwest Afrika in 1904. During the Nama uprising and subsequent pursuit of insurrection leader Jacob Morenga, Vorbeck was brutally injured during a gunfight with Morenga, leaving him half blind. After a brief stint commanding the German colonial forces in Kamerun, Vorbeck was posted to East Afrika where he would be detrimental to the war effort and be the catalyst that would save the East African Campaign. Vorbeck would be apart of several famous battles such as Ngonamo and he would also lead several raiding parties against the British in areas like Rhodesia and Kenya. After successfully beating back the British, Vorbeck helped create the modern Mittelafrikan state and helped again during the British collapse of authority in Afrika but he would return back to Germany, that was until now. Due to several reasons, The Lion of Afrika is back in his old stomping ground and has said enough is enough! Vorbeck is going to do everything in his power to make sure that he can get this mess of a colonial state back on it's feet, but it's unknown whether he can keep this promise."
POLITICS_KENYATTA_DESC:0 "Jomo Kenyatta has been called many things: a dreamer, a fool, an idealist, but now he is known as Staathalter, or Mzee by the natives.  Born in 1897 with the name of Kamau wa Muigai to prosperous Kikuyu farmers in the village of Nginda, Kenyatta received a traditional upbringing common of his people. He joined a christian camp in Thogoto as a young man where he would learn to read and write and convert to Chrstianity. During the war, Kenyatta attended classes at the mission and would hold many varied jobs, interacting with the various peoples of Kenya. With each group he worked with, he would adopt some of their native customs as his own such as wearing a beaded belt of the Maasai culture known as a kinyata; a gift given to him by the Maasai chieftain who married his aunt. Kenyatta would soon adopt the name of this garment as his last name, and later, upon publishing his first works, changed his first name as well to Jomo, based on the Kikuyu word for removing a sword from its scabbard. As the great war raged, he would move around constantly, planting the seeds of his pan-Afrikan ideas.In the years immediately following the end of the Weltkireg, Kenyatta begrudgingly learned German to accommodate for Kenya’s new overlords and would join up with the Kikuyu Central Association, slowly beginning to form his unique national-conservative yet leftist, pan-African political ideology. He would further radicalize after traveling to Europe years later, visiting leftist and nationalist groups in London and Berlin. Now, after climbing through the ranks of the Left-Reformgruppe with the German’s leash limiting his radicalization, Kenyatta has won the first free elections of the Kolonialbund-Mittelafrika. With his surprising win, he has achieved the dreams of Pan-Africanism without a single drop of blood being spilt, native or otherwise. He now looks towards the future to make his final dream a reality: a true Pan-African Federation."
POLITICS_BELL_DESC:0 "Alexander Duala Manga Bell is a man of high regard and station here in the Dark Continent. Born in 1897 in Duala region of Deutsch-Kamerun Cameroon, he traveled to Germany at age the age of four to be educated in the great schools of Europe. Serving gallantly in the Weltkrieg, he fought the vile Entente powers as an officer at Gallipoli. Following the war, given his intelligence and valiant service, the Kaiserreich had Bell stay in Berlin to be thoroughly "Germanized" in preparation for his return to Kamerun, hoping to use him as a local leader in the now gargantuan mess of the newly created Mittelafika. Returning to Kamerun in 1922, accompanied with his new wife and children he met while living in Germany, Bell came home as a hero and a statesman who had received the blessing and praise of the Kaiser himself. Bell's monarchist sympathies and conservative views align well with the German administration, and has now shocked the world with his recent win in Mittelafrika's first continent-wide elections. Under his watch, Mittelafrika shall be transformed into a true Kingdom under the Kaiser, bringing his light to the Dark Continent, and Staathalter Bell shall guide the way." 
POLITICS_SCHNEE_DESC:0 "Few men have seen the world like Heinrich Albert Schnee has. Born in Neuhaldensleben in 1871, Schnee would study law in Heidelberg, Kiel, and Berlin. Upon graduating, he fell into work at the Federal Foregin Office, seeing political service in German holdings New Guinea, Samoa, and Qingdao, as well as the German embassy in London. Shortly before the fires of the Weltkrieg began, he became Hautpmann of East Afrika, leading its fierce Schutztruppe when the war finally broke out. It was then that he would strike up a fierce rivalry with Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, a rivalry that still persists to this day. Since the end of the war, he decided to stick around and has worked his way up the hierarchy of the Dark Continent. Now residing as the Staathalter of all of Mittelafrika, he and the DKG have had a stranglehold on Mittelafrikan politics. Despite his now long reigning dominance in the colony, storm clouds are on the horizon as unrest rises throughout the Kaiser’s Afrikan holdings, and his continued reign is far from certain."
POLITICS_EPSTEIN_DESC:0 "Albert Göring lived in the shadow of his older brother Hermann for much of his young life. Born in 1895, the fifth child esteemed Hauptmann of Südwestafrika Heinrich Göring, Albert and his brother seemed destined for service to the Kaiserreich from birth. Their family was “low nobility” and he lived quite the aristocratic life before serving his country bravely in the Weltkrieg. Always the intelligent and soft-mannered man, after the war he would find peace in filmmaking for a few years before his older brother’s appointment to high office in the Mittelafrikan colonies. With Hermann helping him along the way, Albert would spread his wings while living in Mittelafrika, achieving a great measure of political success, partially thanks to the great weight his family name carried but also due to his scholarly mind and tact for discussion, debate, and compromise. Now, Albert has reached a level of success that surpasses that of even his father, reigning as Staathalter of the entirety of Mittelafrika. From atop this lofty throne, Albert Göring shall blaze his own legacy free from the shadow of his family name, and seek to usher in a new era of prosperity and understanding across the Dark Continent."
POLITICS_WILHELM_II_AFRIKA_DESC:0 "With Alexander Duala Bell’s ascension to Staathalter of Mittelafrika, the ideas of monarchism and Prussian exceptionalism began to rapidly seep into the Dark Continent as the new governor and his administration reorganized the massive colony along the lines of the German Kaiserreich. With the bedrock of their transformative plans completed, the once disorganized patchwork of various dependencies now lay centralized under the benevolent Wilhelm I, Kaiser of Afrika. With his coronation, Wilhelm has become the first monarch of a unified, conservative, pan-African state and with it has solidified his position in the pages of history. Though he still reigns in Berlin and across the wider empire as a whole, Wilhelm too now serves as the head of the Afrikan government, holding all of the powers and privileges he would back in Germany, if not more."
POLITICS_SOLF_DESC:0 "One of the most accomplished and decorated German colonial figures, Wilhelm Heinrich Solf has long lived a fanciful career on the frontiers of the Kaiser’s ever expanding empire. Born in 1862 to a liberal, upscale family in Berlin, Solf received education in a plethora of fields and disciplines, and graduated with a doctorate of philology before taking on a brief stint as a librarian and as a Kriegsmarine sailor. After these short forays, Solf embarked for Calcutta on the commission of the German Foreign Office, starting his famed colonial career. While in India, he studied law, earning another doctorate, and went on to achieve higher and higher diplomatic positions within the German Colonial Service across Asia and Westafrika until earning his keep as the first Governor of German Samoa. Proving himself in these lesser positions, Solf returned to Mittelafrika after a decade in the Pacific to pursue higher stations, and after proving himself as a capable administrator in Africa after the horrors of the Weltkrieg, Solf has risen to become Staathalter of Mittelafrika. \n\nHis tenure as Staathalter has seen great progress and innovation, with agricultural and industrialization programs humming along at optimal efficiency, tensions with the native monarchies at an all-time low, and the usually turbulent politics of Mittelafrika have been somewhat tamed due to Solf’s groundbreaking achievement - creating of loose ruling coalition between his DKG and the various elements of the Reformgrüppe. \n\nNow, after decades of service, the honorable Solf is fading as the ravages of old age slowly consume him, and soon this titan of an era long-past shall fade into pages of history. With his passing - an event many in Mittelafrika wait for like opportunistic vultures - Mittelafrika’s political landscape shall be forever changed as one of the last champions of the Old Guard passes into the next life, throwing the Kaiser’s African possessions into political turmoil."
POLITICS_ROMMEL_DESC:0"The Kaiser has appointed Generaloberst Erwin Rommel as Mittelafrika’s new Statthalter. During the Weltkreig he served in Italy and was awarded the Pour le Mérite. He Served in the infantry, though he would later come to identify with a much more powerful form of warfare, Armoured Warfare. This however gained him many enemies within the High Command, who wanted to keep Germany practicing more traditional forms of warfare. After he published a renowned book on warfare, the Kaiser sent him to Africa to keep him out of the way of the High Command. However, this only strengthened his position in the high command as his doctrine of armoured warfare was perfectly suited the vast African plains. And now, with the Statthalter gone Rommel has been primed to take charge over Mittelafrika, and with him in Charge Mittelafrika’s warfare will be brought into the modern age. "

### Decisions ###
MAF_debt_actions:0 "Dealing with our Debt"
MAF_debt_actions_desc:0 "The Deutsche Kolonialgesellshaft has come up with a plan to deal with our crippling debt. Statthalter [MAF.GetLeader] has consulted with economic secretary Rudolf Asmis who has proposed a number of options that are available to us right now. It seems that all of them will hurt Mittelafrika and empower the Neuen Kolonialclique in the short term, but this is a sacrifice we must be willing to make in order to start thinking about expansion again."
MAF_sell_crops:0 "Buy and Resell Staple Crops"
MAF_sell_crops_desc:0 "Asmis has observed that it has been proven difficult for our settlers to sell their produce on the international market. Embargoes by the Entente limit their potential buyers from the get-go and our policy regarding who can export what are byzantine and confusing. To make matters worse, the French settlers within our territories trade on pre-Weltkrieg terms and are largely evading our taxes this way. We must seek to remedy this by purchasing crops directly from our settlers and reselling them ourselves. One price, one market, one Mittelafrika."
MAF_layoffs:0 "Lay off French Civil Servants"
MAF_layoffs_desc:0 "Our administration continues to pay the salaries of the French civil servants within our colonial territory. Asmis has proposed that we simply fire them. Competent German replacements will follow suit once our financial situation improves."
MAF_export_weapons:0 "Sell Guns to the Reichspakt"
MAF_export_weapons_desc:0 "While we do not possess the industrial capacity of a modern European nation by any means, Asmis has still recommended we approach our broader Reichspakt alliance to purchase Mittelafrikan guns. Everyone needs guns, anyhow."
MAF_press_natives:0 "Press the Natives to Work Harder"
MAF_press_natives_desc:0 "Perhaps the most obvious solution Asmis has presented us, he suggests that we engage in a widespread program to “encourage” our African population to do their damnedbest for the Vaterland.  While this will definitely hurt our stability in the short term, we can rest assured that the whip cracks out of love."
MAF_sell_plantations:0 "Privatise Plantations Across the Colony"
MAF_sell_plantations_desc:0 "While the Neue Kolonialclique has issued a formal protest against this proposal by Asmis, the Kolonialgesellshaft sees no harm in selling off state-owned plantations to private investors. Whatever industrial capacity we might lose from it in the long term we can surely make up for through short-term profits."
MAF_crime_actions:0 "Illicit Activities"
MAF_crime_actions_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has thrown our bureau of the budget into complete disarray. Only Asmis is still convinced we can stay the course by continuing with his proposals, but almost everyone else in the Mittelafrikan administration is calling for radical, drastic action. The Neue Kolonialclique and in particular the Souverainisten within them have already approached us with some "alternative" means of dealing with our skyrocketing debt. Whether we actually listen to them is up to us, but there is little doubt that without implementing at least some of their ideas Mittelafrika will spiral into more instability than it can ever hope to recover from."
MAF_grow_opium:0 "Grow Opium in Ostafrika"
MAF_grow_opium_desc:0 "Hermann von Göring, ever looking for ways to increase his influence in Mittelafrika, has apparently been in talk with his compatriots in Ostasien, who have collectively approached us with a suggestion. Göring owns several plantations in Tanga and Dodoma which he is willing to donate to the state so long as we assist him in growing Afghan opium on them, to then sell on the black market. He assures is that we will not get in legal trouble if Berlin gets word of this, but the consequences of introducing so much illegal opium onto our streets are totally unforseeable."
MAF_human_trafficking:0 "Human Trafficking"
MAF_human_trafficking_desc:0 "The Duke of Oldenburg, who adminsters Westafrika on behalf of us, has spoken to Harvey Firestone of Firestone rubber in Liberia. The two men offer a lucrative business plan in which we support Monrovia’s rubber plantations by providing Firestone with a yearly quotum of labourers which they will pay us handsomely for. When asked what kind of labourers they were looking for, a representative of Firestone slipped us some American dollars and requested us to not inquire further on the matter. It seems obvious what is being suggested here. The Kolonialgesellshaft is debating how to move forward."
MAF_blood_diamonds:0 "Blood Diamonds"
MAF_blood_diamonds_desc:0 "Pierre Ryckmans and the representatives of the Flandro-Wallonian Congolese government have contacted us with a deal. They promise to practically double their output in precious metals so long as we skip the mandatory oversight checks of the Force Publique for the next few years. These checks are normally carried out to ensure ethical human conduct in exploitation ventures in the Congo so skipping them would mean the Flandro-Wallonian administration is no longer being held accountable for the way they treat their African workers."
MAF_embezzle_funds:0 "Embezzle Funds"
MAF_embezzle_funds_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to everyone in Mittelafrika, the Souverainisten have been restaffing key posts in Ostafrika for quite some time now. Hermann von Göring is debating whether or not to make some money that would normally go to our protectorates “disappear” to secretly invest it back into the German colonies, as well as some other projects of his."
MAF_MEFO_bills:0 "Issue MEFO bills"
MAF_MEFO_bills_desc:0 "Fritz Thyssen of the Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft has proposed us with a deal. He wishes to issue special bills that function as bailout bonds on behalf of his company to our government, which would alleviate our debt tremendously. The problem the Kolonialgesellshaft foresees however is that Thyssen would effectively own large swathes of Mittelafrika and he is known to associate with Hermann von Göring, so the administration is torn on whether or not to pursue this venture."
MAF_NKR_actions:0 "Implementing the Four Year Plan"
MAF_NKR_actions_desc:0 "The Deutsch-Kolonialgesellschaft has finally been ousted and the Neue Kolonialclique is in power. The time has come to implement our four-year plan to forge Mittelafrika into Germania's iron fist against syndicalism. Arthur Zimmerman has proposed a number of projects which could potentially triple our industrial output, but the remnants of the DKG that are still within our administration whine and complain that going down this path will "upset the delicate balance" of the colony. This is, of course, of no concern to us. There are millions of Africans that can work and bleed for the Vaterland. If some should die in the process, our administration considers that an acceptable loss."
MAF_mining_campaigns:0 "Mining Campaigns"
MAF_mining_campaigns_desc:0 "We can massively increase the mining output of Mittelafrika through the use of extra-legal contract labour. We would ship in natives from across the colony to work in "Kaiserbergwerken" where they will be lodged until their contract ends. The pay we give them is always less than the amount of Reichsmarks we charge for the lodging, so we profit off of our workers forever until they are inevitably replaced."
MAF_skull_roads:0 "Schädelstraßen"
MAF_skull_roads_desc:0 "Much of Mittelafrika is comprised of inefficient tribal villages with little in the way of industrial capacity. We will use the Schutztruppen and some mercenary attachments to clear out these villages and press the natives to build "Kaiserstraßen" to connect our colonial settlements. Word has spread that the locals call them "Schädelstraßen", but this is nonsense, of course. Skulls make for very poor roadtiles."
MAF_logging_campaigns:0 "Logging Campaigns"
MAF_logging_campaigns_desc:0 "Mittelafrika could be the foremost producer of wood in the world! All it takes is some extra-legal labour, a few garrisons here and there, and our "Kaiser-Holzfällerlager" will bring us great profits. Those trees were only standing in our way, anyway."
MAF_kaiser_factories:0 "Kaiser Factories"
MAF_kaiser_factories_desc:0 "A minor minister has suggested that we construct arnament manufactories directly inside native villages, effectively converting them into processing plants with pre-built lodging. He calls these manufactories "Kaiserfabriken". Zimmerman had commended the administrator and has given the Neue Kolonialclique the go-ahead to start building."
MAF_settlement_cities:0 "Settlement Cities"
MAF_settlement_cities_desc:0 "The Statthalter and Zimmerman have been discussing an expansion of German settlement in Mittelafrika. Our administration can employ extra-legal contractors to construct "Siedlungsstädte" which are almost entirely self-sufficient, clear wasteful terrain and disperse idle natives. Clearly this is an excellent idea which we should move forward on."
MAF_Settler_actions:0 "Dealing with the Europeans"
MAF_Settler_actions_desc:0 "With our debt finally paid off and the corruption in our government flushed out, the Deutsch-Kolonialgesellschaft can finally start addressing a problem that has plagued Mittelafrika since its inception; the status of our non-German European population. We currently have four different groups that we need to re-examine our relationship with. First is the French, who despite legally being Mittelafrikans and thus subject to German laws enjoy many of their pre-Weltkrieg priveleges. Second is the Flandro-Wallonians, who have a disproportionate amount of influence in our colony’s financial and industrial sectors. Third is the British, who we spend a large portion of our annual budget on protecting from native uprisings and syndicalism. Fourth is the miscellanious European mercenaries that serve as our auxillaries in the Schutztruppen, for which they recieve more pay than our regular police forces and garrisons."
MAF_the_french:0 "The French"
MAF_the_french_desc:0 "The French territories of Gabon and Tschad are under our direct control, Elfenbeinküste and Dahomey are administered by Westafrika. All the same, the French have too much influence in our colonies. We need to come up with a solution that satisfies both parties."
MAF_the_belgians:0 "The Flandro-Wallonians"
MAF_the_belgians_desc:0 "The Flandro-Wallonian captains of industry have expanded their influence far beyond the Congo and have nearly monopolished certain areas of resource exploitation within Mittelafrika. While they are Mitteleuropan citizens, the Kolonialgesellschaft thinks it is best if we negotiate some kind of deal with them to consolidate the position of Germany within its own colonies. Perhaps we can even resolve the matter of Flandro-Wallonian Congolese autonomy if we come to a satisfactory agreement."
MAF_the_british:0 "The British"
MAF_the_british_desc:0 "The British protectates are costly ventures and securing them means diverting our already overstretched Schutztruppen away from defending Mittelafrika proper. The Kolonialgesellschaft will contact the British under our suzerainity and negotiate a deal with them."
MAF_NKRSettler_actions:0 "Dealing with the Europeans"
MAF_NKRSettler_actions_desc:0 "With our debt finally paid off and the perfidious Alter Kämpfer disgraced by the corruption investigating, the Neue Kolonialclique can finally call itself the Neue Kolonialregierung. It is time to put forward our plans for the Europeans within Mittelafrika and those in our protectorates. Millitarising the colony to combat syndicalism in Europe is our number one priority, which conveniently gives us carte blanche in many ventures the old DKG would not dare to embark on. Well, according to ourselves, anyway."
MAF_the_frenchNKR:0 "The French"
MAF_the_frenchNKR_desc:0 "The French are Mittelafrikans now and they damn well better listen to Mittelafrikan law. We will end their priveleges and demand they either step down to the level of our German administrators or face the consequences and become second-class citizens. As well as they should be."
MAF_the_belgiansNKR:0 "The Flandro-Wallonians"
MAF_the_belgiansNKR_desc:0 "The Flandro-Wallonians run away with our natural resources and pocket the profits for themselves. No more. We will approach their government with an ultimatum to either pay up or shut up and become integrated into Mittelafrika proper. Perhaps we might even do both."
MAF_the_britishNKR:0 "The British"
MAF_the_britishNKR_desc:0 "Our arrangement with the British is expensive, inefficient and above all entirely based upon a pipe dream of theirs. Brittania of old is gone, it is time their colonial governors accept this. We shall organise a conference to pursuade the protectorates to either unconditionally side with us in the conflict to come or submit to German governance like Nordrhodesien in 1925."
MAF_RFG_actions:0 "Rethinking our Administration"
MAF_RFG_actions_desc:0 "The Kaiser has agreed to finally democratise Mittelafrika. We must not let this golden opportunity go to waste; there is much to be done. Although the Reformgruppe functions as a united front against the autocrats in the NKR and the reactionaries in the DKG, it is actually comprised of many different factions who all have their own plans for the future of the colony. We shall consider our options carefully as we move forward to make the Dark Continent brighter."
MAF_fight_NKR:0 "Combat NKR Influence"
MAF_fight_NKR_desc:0 "The corruption investigation may be over and Goering may be under house arrest in Tanga, but many “blameless” NKR members still work to counter our reforms. The right wing of the Reformgruppe wants to continue conducting smaller corruption investigations to combat their remaining influence."
MAF_encourage_investment:0 "Market Liberalisation"
MAF_encourage_investment_desc:0 "Under the DKG Mittelafrika was almost a command economy; free trade did exist, but only within the Mitteleuropan market bloc. The center wing of the Reformgruppe wants to explore other markets such as the Entente and the Co-Prosperty sphere in a program of general economic liberalisation."
MAF_catholic_missions:0 "Encourage Catholic Missions"
MAF_catholic_missions_desc:0 "A coalition of center-left Catholics within the Reformgruppe (mainly comprised of Flandro-Wallonian and French Europeans) wants the government to sponsor Catholic missions within its territories. While rightists have voiced their concern about a potential neglect of Protestant values, the center-left has assured us that these missions will only be carried out in areas where Catholicism is already prevalent. Mittelafrika is vast after all, there is room for all good Christians here."
MAF_worker_conditions:0 "Improve Worker Conditions"
MAF_worker_conditions_desc:0 "The left-wing of the Reformgruppe, led by Albert von Göring, has proposed a social democratic reform package to improve the conditions of both native and European workers within Mittelafrika. Most of the center and right-wing is sceptical about the costs of this proposal, but von Göring assures as that it will benefit all of Mittelafrika in the long term."
MAF_do_journalism:0 "Spread Word of our Success"
MAF_do_journalism_desc:0 "The center-left and left-wing of the Reformgruppe is quite active in the media. Casimir Zagourski and Albert von Göring want to engage in a widespreas propaganda campaign within Mittelafrika and beyond to advertise our planned reforms. Von Göring laughed away concerns about associations with his last name, stating: “Not all that is Goering is evil.”"
MAF_convince_DKG:0 "Assuage the Fears of the Alter Kämpfer"
MAF_convince_DKG_desc:0 "While many of the Alter Kämpfer are sympathetic to our cause, some are still on the fence about democratising Mittelafrika. If we devote some resources towards convincing them that our reforms are better for everybody, perhaps they might be pursuaded to join us. We except they would never go much further than the right-wing our the Reformgruppe, but that is no concern to us."
MAF_the_mercs:0 "The Mercenaries"
MAF_the_mercs_desc:0 "Due to how expansive Mittelafrika has become after the 1925 British revolution, our Schutztruppen and Polizeitruppen have increasingly ben supplemented by European mercenaries. Their pay is higher than our regular soldiers’, they are known to commit atrocities when they are without German oversight and their quality can vary wildly. The Kolonialgesellschaft has to come to a decision as to what to do about all of this."
MAF_the_mercsNKR:0 "The Mercenaries"
MAF_the_mercsNKR_desc:0 "Due to how expansive Mittelafrika has become after the 1925 British revolution, our Schutztruppen and Polizeitruppen have increasingly ben supplemented by European mercenaries. While the NKR takes no issue with any of these reported “atrocities”, the fact remains that private millitary power is expensive and we have no control over what kind of mercenaries come to work for us at the moment. Several plans have been put forward to resolve this matter, so that the Mittelafrikan army may serve the Vaterland better."

MAF_collapse_actions:0 "Preventing the Collapse of Mittekafrika"
MAF_collapse_actions_desc:0 "The complete collapse of the Mittelafrikan Project is an ever-looming threat, for this mangled, interconnected mire of political treaties and diplomatic facades is always standing on the brink of total chaos.

To rectify this, we shall fully open the Congo to German settlement, for we have respected the authority of the Flandro-Wallonians and the deals we made as their empire fell long enough. This bountiful, populous, and resource-rich colony shall serve as a beacon to anyone in the Kaiserreich seeking a new life abroad, and by offering lucrative incentives and by quietly burning old land contracts given to natives and non-German colonials, we shall ensure many sons and daughters of the Kaiserreich come, and that those who do come definitely have a place to stay and build their new lives."

mittelpolitic.7.t:0 "Death of Wilhelm Solf"
mittelpolitic.7.d:0 "Saddening news has spread across Mittelafrika and the wider Kaiserreich this day, for after a long career and decades of service to his nation and the Crown, Staathalter Wilhelm Solf has passed away. A visionary that has propelled Mittelafrika into a new age of prosperity and relative peace, Solf has ruled our megacolony as the head of the DKG in a groundbreaking coalition with various elements within the Reformgruppe. Together, this administration has passed new reformative policies with each new session of Mittelafrika’s leading minds, further modernizing this once backwards relic of a colonial era long passed, and now Solf’s replacement, Heinrich Schnee, hopes to carry on his legacy. \n\nHowever, not all has been so peaceful and prosperous as many of the propaganda posters around the colony so claim, for ethnic tensions and political infighting are once again on the rise. With the Mau-Mau in open rebellion in Kenya, the Mwami antagonizing the Flandro-Wallonians in Katanga, the Muslims in Hausaland constantly rioting, and a slew of other internal issues, Mittelafrika’s once unified political stage has now broken down into a pit of political maneuvering and scheming as each faction seeks glory and power. \n\nThe chief threat to the Schnee and the DKG is the NKG, a coalition of eager young officers and disillusioned Old Guard that have rallied around figures like Franz Ritter von Epp and Reinhard Heydrich, while nominating the ever-ambitious Hermann Göring as their frontline candidate in the race for Staathalter, hoping to bank on the Göring family legacy to carry them to victory over the Old Guard of the DKG. Hermann’s father was once the governor of Südwestafrika, serving admirably, and viciously, against the Herero that long plagued the German regime, and as such the other members of the NKG believe that Göring, despite his reputation, is their best chance to steal the Staathaltership. \n\nAfter days of debate, the interim ruling council of Mittelafrika had finally agreed on a candidate to put forth, and now the rest of the colony waits to see who they have nominated. However, despite the nomination, the final choice is up to the Kaiser."

mittelpolitic.700.t:0 "The New Colonial Group"

Composed of a few German veterans who had broken off from the DKG like Franz Ritter von Epp and Reinhard Heydrich who now lead a band of younger, more ravenous officers and soldiers in defiance of the status quo. Seeking a larger, more centralized, and more Germanized Mittelafrika, the NKG cares not for obstacles such as ‘human rights’ and the like, and instead are solely focused on increasing the Kaiserreich’s, and in turn their own power and fortunes. \n\nAs if this was not dangerous enough, the group has currently rallied around Hermann Göring, son of the infamous Butcher of the Herero and an accomplished fighter ace from the Weltkireg. In Göring, they see a useful figurehead to captipult themselves into the position of Staathaler, but a man such as Göring always has his own ambitions, even if the rest of the NKR is not aware of this yet. In secret, Göring is the head of a small group of nationalist radicals known as the ‘Souveränisten’. This group of ‘sovereignists’ secretly plot to surpass the centralization efforts of the NKR, instead seeking to build up Mittelafrika as a truly independent state that is on equal footing to the Kaiserreich. Though this is likely a fool’s errand, it has not stopped the madman Göring from drafting up plans and strategies for how to achieve his demented goals, and with his ever-growing army of young followers marching behind him, his threats may not be as hollow as once thought. \n\nRegardless of Göring’s scheming in the dark, the wider NKG still holds a great sway of influence within our government, and if Staathalter Solf soon passes like he is expected to, then the NKR would serve as the DKG’s and RFG’s main rivals in the race for picking the new Staathaler. Whether or not the NKR succeeds in their dreams of a centralized Mittelafrika, or God forbid Göring and his Souveränisten get their wish, shall soon be determined as the very destiny of this Dark Continent hands in the balance."

mittelpolitic.701.d:0 "The DKG, or Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, has long been the dominant political force and leading party in Mittelafrika. Composed of a mix of veteran generals, honored colonial bureaucrats, and various other aging relics of the Weltkrieg era and permanent fixtures of the German colonial regime, the DKG is the staunch Old Guard of the Mittelafrikan political scene. Like an iron wall, they stand unyielding in defense of the status quo, seeking to continue the Kaiser’s Afrikan project - colonizing the swathes of Mittelafrika and reaping the profits of this expansion - without dragging the continent into chaos with excessive reform or centralization attempts. \n\nSince the fires of the Weltkrieg, the DKG has ruled over Mittelafrika, guided by the likes of Wilhelm Solf, Heinrich Schnee, and many other titans of the German colonial scene, but since the early 1920’s, these aging agents of the Kaiser have not rules alone. After a rise in tensions across Mittelafrika after the collapse of the British and French Empires that led to our colony taking on the old colonial lands of our fallen enemies, instability and unrest across the megacolony were at a fever pitch. However, after careful delegation, cooperation, and diplomacy, Staathalter Wilhelm Solf was able to arrange a groundbreaking coalition government with the Reformgruppe - a massive group of more liberal minded colonials mixed with even a few Askari and Évolués allowed within the government that are hellbent on reforming and modernizing Mittelafrika into a functional, loosely democratic state. With this unheard of cooperation between Germany’s colonial Old Guard and this Liberal-dominated clique, Mittelafrika has largely towed the main line, never veering too far from the set status quo, while occasionally passing tacitly liberal policies to maintain the coalition and keep the peace. However, with Staathalter Solf growing older and less fit to rule this wild frontier with each day, many believe that the writing is already on the wall for the DKG as the RFG seeks to spread their own wings while the DKG’s other, more hostile political enemies gather strength in the dark..."

mittelpolitic.702.d:0 "Long has the Kaiserreich now held a stake in Africa, first obtaining Westafrika, Südwestafrika, and Kamerun in 1884 at the Berlin Conference. In the decades that have followed, the Kaiser’s ambitions have only grown and now, after the Weltkrieg and its wake, the Iron Cross of Germany looms over two-thirds of the continent. Since its inception, a loyal clique of staunchly monarchist generals and bureaucrats have stood as the scions of this new colonial realm, in the form of the DKG. \n\nAs the years have passed however, these aging veterans and relics of a year long passed have only gotten older, and with it, their grip over Africa has slipped - a fact sharply shown in their need to form a soft ruling coalition with elements of the Reformgrüppe shortly after Germany’s victory in the Weltkrieg. \n\nIn the aftermath of this necessary decision, the NKG - a rival group of aging, hawkish colonial administrators mixed with various elements of the less radical younger officers - broke off from the DKG to form their own clique poised to take the position of Staathalter for themselves. This syncretic clique of both young and old officers seeks to centralize and further Germanize Mittelafrika, but their goals are far from extremist or radical in nature. \n\nThat dubious honor goes to the Young Officers Clique, who have increasingly become called the ‘Souveränisten’. Consisting of various disillusioned Mittelafrikan youth officers currently within the NKG who joined the colonial service to further the Pride of the Fatherland only to have the dark and decayed nature of Mittelafrika revealed to them and led, though unofficially, by Hermann Goering, these ‘Souveränisten’ are a menace to Mittelafrikan stability. \n\nThis divide between a dying Old Guard falling to various flavors of young officer and civilian movements form the basis of Mittelafrica’s internal political divisions today, and if they do not get a grip on the situation soon, the stalking opportunists like the integrated French, the autonomous Anglos, and even the evermore-angry natives may seize on their chance to strike during the chaos."

Surrounded by his political allies from Mittelafrika as well as his surviving family and closest confidants, the body of the old, honorable Solf was lowered into the soft earth, entombed in a rosewood casket using lumber sourced from the late Staathalter’s own Mittelafrikan summer estate. With his passing, the position of Staathalter has been left temporarily vacant until a new replacement is put forth and accepted by the Kaiser, but until then, a small council of DKG officials led by Heinrich Schnee shall maintain order in the colonies.

mittel.9.d:0 "We should launch a formal complaint against Portugal. The continued existence of these 'bandit' camps possess a clear threat to our colony. If they cannot deal with a few bandits, they're clearly not fit to be a colonial power."
mittel.9.a:0 "Summon the Portuguese Consul! We will deal with this ourselves!"
mittel.9.b:0 "We shall take this all the way to Berlin!"

mittel.10.t:0 "The Portuguese-Mittelafrika Dispute"
mittel.10.d:0 "Our Mittelafrikan Statthalter has come to us with a request for aid, he speaks of Portugal supporting bandits that murder German and Afrikan police and endanger our rule in Afrika, what should we do?"
mittel.10.a:0 "Our relations with Portugal are too important, tell them to stand down."
mittel.10.b:0 "We shall take up the matter with Portugal ourself!"

mittel.11.t:0 "The Kaiser Refuses"
mittel.11.d:0 "The Kaiser has refused to help us, telling us to stand down and to stop ruining German relations with Portugal. We cannot expect any help from Berlin."
mittel.11.a:0 "We have no choice but to follow the Kaiser's instructions."
mittel.11.b:0 "Ignore him! We will deal with this on our own..."

mittel.1101.t:0 "Mittelafrika Ignored Us"
mittel.1101.d:0 "Our Mittelafrikan Statthalter had the nerve to ignore our instructions and has taken up the issue with the Portuguese Consul directly. This is nothing short of an outrage, treason, mutiny!"
mittel.1101.a:0 "Cut their supplies, they can't be allowed to get away with this!"

mittel.1102.t:0 "The Kaiser Retaliates"
mittel.1102.d:0 "The Kaiser has dropped our supply shipments and denounced our actions. We will certainty feel the pinch over the next few months."

mittel.12.t:0 "The Germans Come Knocking"
mittel.12.d:0 "The Germans in Daressalam have come to their overlords in Berlin, and told them about our support of rebels in their territory, now Berlin demands we produce an explanation for our actions..."

mittel.1201.t:0 "Portugal Denied Our Request"
mittel.1201.d:0 "The Portuguese government refused to 'discuss internal affairs with foreign nations', this is not on at all and we have send them a strongly worded letter reminded them of their duties to us."
mittel.1201.a:0 "An outrage!"
mittel.1201.b:0 "Unacceptable! Tell Mittelafrika they can deal with it!"

mittel.1202.t:0 "An Offer From Germany"
mittel.1202.d:0 "The Portuguese government has refused to 'discuss internal affairs' Germany and in retaliation the Kaiser has given us the green light to deal with this issue as we see fit."

mittel.1401.d:0 "Having engaged with the German government about the issue, we have no choice but to follow their request and stand down with our attacks."

mittel.15.d:0 "The Germans in Daressalam have noticed our support of rebels in their territories, and are now demanding we crack down on the rebels or 'face consequences'. What should we do?"
mittel.15.a:0 "Excellent, perhaps we can avenge 1918!"
mittel.15.b:0 "We have no choice, disarm the Ruga-Ruga, by force if needed."

mittel.16.t:0 "Portugal Disarms the Rebels!"
mittel.16.d:0 "The Portuguese have disarmed the bandits they have been sending into our territory at great cost to their own colonial stability. This matter is now truly solved."
mittel.16.a:0 "Independent action pays off."

mittel.17.t:0 "Portugal Stands Against Us!"
mittel.17.d:0 "The Portuguese have refused to disarm the bandits they've been sending into our colonies, if we wish to stop this, we will have to take real action against Portugal..."

mittel.17.b:0 "We can't make our move, yet...."

mittel.18.t:0 "Mittelafrika Stands Down"
mittel.18.d:0 "The German weaklings in Daressalam have stood down from stopping our bandit attacks, we can now freely continue these attacks as we please."

mittel.22.d:0 "The Mittelafrikan raid into our territory has ended, after burning down our bandit camps and slaughtering most of their inhabitants, their troops withdrew back into Mittelafrikan territory."
mittel.22.a:0 "That is the end of that."

mittel.23.t:0 "Mittelafrika's Proposal"
mittel.23.d:0 "A Mittelafrikan envoy has arrived, claiming that Portugal is a dangerously irresponsible administrator of its African colonies, and has proposed a secret compact to divide Mozambique between us if war breaks out between the two. We would get a good share of the spoils, which would be sure to please our land hungry Boer population, but the Anglophones look at Mittelafrika with suspicion and fear, while prefering Portugal as an ally. Drastic action at this point would be highly contentious, especially with the looming elections..."
mittel.23.a:0 "Consider all our options, stall for time."
mittel.23.b:0 "It's an opportunity we can't afford to turn down."

mittel.24.t:0 "Negotiations With South Africa"
mittel.24.d:0 "South Africa has stalled. The South Africans have refused to say no, but they won't commit, and won't even say what it is they want. We suspect that the South Africans don't want to make a momentous decision before their highly contested elections. The Boer population and their National Party favours our position and is pushing to sign the deal, while the English settlers and their Dominion Party favour the Portuguese. We should watch the upcoming elections closely, as victory or defeat for the Boers could decide this whole conflict."
mittel.24.a:0 "Fine we'll wait."
mittel.24.b:0 "The deal's off the table then"

mittel.25.t:0 "Mittelafrika Walks Out"
mittel.25.d:0 "The delegation from Mittelafrika has left the negotiations citing that the vague position of our own diplomats. With this they have also officially announced they are no longer supporting our claim to the lower portion of Mozambique and that they will not aid us in attempting to seize it."
mittel.25.a:0 "Oh well..."

mittel.26.t:0 "South Africa Accepts"
mittel.26.d:0 "Our friends in South Africa have accepted the deal, and have managed to push it through their parliament. With their support, Portugal will be unable to resist us. We should move to demand the partition of the Mozambique now."

mittel.27.t:0 "The Mittelafrikan-South African Alliance"
mittel.27.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have turned South Africa against us with promises of land in southern Mozambique. There is no way we can resist their combined forces, perhaps we must give Mozambique up..."

mittel.27.b:0 "War!"

mittel.28.t:0 "Portugal Surrenders Mozambique"
mittel.28.d:0 "The Portuguese have surrendered Mozambique as we had wanted, it is now time to fulfil our promises of partition with our friends in South Africa. The problems with Portugal are now over."

mittel.29.t:0 "We've Gained Southern Mozambique!"
mittel.29.d:0 "Our alliance with Mittelafrika has paid off, the Portuguese have surrendered Mozambique to Mittelafrika and they have given the southern part of it to us. What a great time for South Africa!"

mittel.30.t:0 "The Mittelafrikans Will Wait"
mittel.30.d:0 "Good news has reached us from Daressalam, the Mittelafrikan administration has agreed to wait until after the elections before pressing the volatile Mozambique issue any further, giving time for the Nationalists to consolidate their support and leave nothing to chance."
mittel.30.a:0 "Great news!"

mittel.31.t:0 "The National Party Wins the Civil War"
mittel.31.d:0 "The Boers have defeated their Anglo rivals in the South African civil war, effectively neutering them as a force in politics. It is now time to approach them again with our offer to split Mozambique, perhaps there will be a different reaction this time."
mittel.31.a:0 "Send another envoy."

mittel.32.t:0 "Mittelafrika Delegation Returns"
mittel.32.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have returned with the offer to split Mozambique with them, now that we have dealt with the Dominionists, we will be able to freely support Mittelafrika if we wish."
mittel.32.a:0 "Agree to the offer, it is time to take Mozambique."
mittel.32.b:0 "Decline, we must rebuild our divided nation."

mittel.33.t:0 "Returning the Portuguese Colonies"
mittel.33.d:0 "With our victory in the civil war, the time has come to return Mozambique to Portugal and arrange to have the Boer population that attempted to colonize the area returned to South Africa proper."
mittel.33.a:0 "Let's inform Madrid"

mittel.34.t:0 "South Africa Returns Mozambique!"
mittel.34.d:0 "Great news, an envoy from South Africa has arrived today informing us that they are in the process of dismantling their administration in Mozambique and will hand over the colony shortly."

mittel.35.t:0 "Integrating The New Colonies"
mittel.35.d:0 "Now that we have taken over part of the Mozambique colony we have been left with a hostile population that is not averse to attempting to destabilize the local authorities. It'll take some time but eventually we'll be able to integrate the colony into our system properly."
mittel.35.a:0 "Oh well."

mittel.36.t:0 "Asking South Africa For Help?""
mittel.36.d:0 "With the border raids escalating by the day and clear involvement of Portuguese involvement its time to press the offensive. To the South, the Boers have long eyed the lower portion of Mozambique. We could extent an offer of spoils if they partage in our war."
mittel.36.a:0 "Send an envoy!"
mittel.36.b:0 "We'd rather not involve them"

mittel.37.t:0 "The Assassination of Hans-Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck"
mittel.37.d:0 "Today, Hans-Albert von Lettow-Vorbeck, son of the famed general and first Statthalter of Mittelafrika Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck, and promising officer in his own right, was shot to death in broad daylight in the city of Mbeya. The killer was of the Ngoni ethnic group, and was deported to Mozambique at the age of 4 along with his family after the execution of his father in 1921. He claims the assassination as vengeance for the death of his father, but we suspect he was at least given assistance by the Portuguese. A state funeral for Vorbeck and a military expedition are being prepared. and the old guard are crying out for blood. If we do not act now, when?"
mittel.37.a:0 "Declare war on Portugal! For vengeance!"
mittel.37.b:0 "It is too risky, we must hold back..."
mittel.37.c:0 "The pact Portugal has with South Africa holds us back, it is too dangerous..."

mittel.38.t:0 "Mittelafrika Declares War!"
mittel.38.d:0 "One of our operatives has murdered a high value target in Mittelafrika, out of sheer rage the Statthalter has declared an invasion of our territories. We must now defend them with our blood, war is upon us."
mittel.38.a:0 "Angola e Nossa!"

mittel.39.t:0 "Defeat in Africa"
mittel.39.d:0 "The Mittelafrikans have defeated our forces in Africa, it may be time to surrender our colonies for now, let us see what it is Mittelafrika wants out of this war..."

mittel.39.b:0 "We shall never surrender!"

mittel.390.t:0 "Forcing the Bush War to End in Our Favor"
mittel.390.d:0 "With our complete decimation of the Portuguese Armed Forces, and with a great deal of luck, we have been able to land in the Portuguese capital of Lisbon. With this beautiful old European city under our control, we have stabbed our foe in their soft underbelly and now hold them by the balls. We shall demand the entirety of the Portuguese Empire’s holdings in Africa, and they are in no position to deny us."
mittel.390.a:0 "With our arrival in Lisbon, the Portuguese shall surely fold!"

mittel.391.t:0 "The Writing on the Wall Cannot Be Ignored"
mittel.391.d:0 "With the collapse of our inadequate and incompetent military, we have completely folded to the Mittelafrikan offence, and now, defying the odds, the Krauts march on Lisbon. With the loss of our capital, the Germans have demanded that we secede all of our African possessions to the Kaiserreich, who shall allow them to be incorporated into Mittelafrika"
mittel.391.a:0 "We have no choice but to cede our African colonies to the Krauts."


mittel.392.t:0 "Forcing the Hand of the Portuguese"
mittel.392.d:0 "With our demands met, as if there was any doubt, the Portuguese have begun the process of transferring ownership and control over Angola, Mozambique, Cabinda, and every other slice of Portuguese Africa to Dar-Es-Salaam. As our already overburdened colonial apparatus takes in these new territories however, a cause for concern has arisen. Taking in these now war-torn and unrest-filled colonies directly into our administration so soon may cause great waves of instability to ripple throughout our already fragile Mittelafrika. Instead, some have called for us to create a series of protectorates to control these lands, similar to the Anglo Free States. What shall we do?"
mittel.392.a:0 "Absorb the colonies directly into Mittelafrika proper."
mittel.392.b:0 "Set up Portuguese Protectorates in the taken land."

mittel.40.t:0 "The Portuguese Surrender"
mittel.40.d:0 "We have defeated the Portuguese in Africa, and they have started negotiations to surrender. It is now time to decide what it is we want to get out of this war. The old guard suggests we should take only northern Mozambique, as it was our original goal in this war. Members of the NKR suggest taking all of Mozambique or establishing security zones in Mozambique and Angola, while the most radical members of our administration say we should strip Portugal of all African holdings, what shall be done?"
mittel.40.a:0 "Listen to the old guard, take only northern Mozambique."
mittel.40.b:0 "Only taking all of Mozambique will ensure safety."
mittel.40.c:0 "Establish security zones in Mozambique and Angola."
mittel.40.e:0 "Portugal has forfeited their colonial holdings with their reckless behaviour, take it all!"

mittel.41.t:0 "Defeat in Africa"
mittel.41.d:0 "The Portuguese have defeated our forces in Vorbecksland. Perhaps it is time to offer our surrender, if we lose any more land it could be disastrous for our colonial stability..."
mittel.41.a:0 "Offer our surrender."
mittel.41.b:0 "We shall never surrender!"

mittel.42.t:0 "Mittelafrika Surrenders!"
mittel.42.d:0 "The German weakling have been defeated by our glorious armies! We have finally avenged 1918 and can establish the 'Pink Map' vision our greatest minds have had for a long time. Demand Vorbecksland and Njassaland, this is the start of the new Portuguese empire!"
mittel.42.a:0 "Hoorah for Portugal!"

mittel.43.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.43.d:0 "An unusual case has reached the highest court in the German State. Anti-Colonial activist Jomo Kenyatta has brought a class action lawsuit against former Afrikan Statthalter Wilhelm Solf. The case has become something of an embarrassment, as some of the plaintiffs are veterans of the Weltkrieg, it can not be easily dismissed. They claim that Solf's administration harmed them through policies of illegal land seizures, and even abductions and torture, all done with Solf's knowledge and little legal basis. Quietly, the foreign office has explained to the government that such things are common and necessary in our colonial administration. They strongly urge we quash this motion."
mittel.43.a:0 "The court has no right to rule on Mittelafrikan affairs."
mittel.43.b:0 "What's the worst that could happen?"

mittel.44.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.44.d:0 "Disaster! We have been watching the litigation of Jomo Kenyatta for years with nervous anticipation, and now our worst fears have been realised. Former Statthalter Wilhelm Solf has been found liable for 'extralegal' actions taken as Statthalter. The damages were not ruinous to Solf, but it has opened a door, to theoretically limitless cases. Already, Statthalter von Göring has resigned in protest. In the aftermath, legal reform and a more 'normalised' governance of Africa is the only viable option, and the only person willing to take charge and implement these reforms is Theodor von Hassel, may God help him."
mittel.44.a:0 "Gott mitt uns."

mittel.45.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.45.d:0 "Our Administration has been watching with nervous anticipation the progression of the Kenyatta-Solf Affair, in which a Kikuyu lawyer is leading a class action lawsuit against former Statthalter Wihelm Solf. Fortunately, the defence lawyer Carl Schmitt produced a novel defence, that has established a new legal precedent: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception." The courts accepted this argument, that the Statthalter is the sovereign authority in Africa, and has the right to 'step outside' normal legal proceedings. This obviously has startling implications, and some members of our administration already eagerly anticipate a 'Sovereign Statthalter'."
mittel.45.a:0 "The Sovereign is he who decides on the exception."

mittel.46.t:0 "The Black Dossier"
mittel.46.d:0 "A group of anonymous officers and administrators in Mittelafrika have compiled documentation and evidence of illegal activity by Statthalter von Göring and presented it to the Cabinet. The evidence, if true, is very serious. According to what they allege, Statthalter von Göring has been using the generous state budget we have provided him with to buy off politicians throughout the Reichspakt in order to secure support for his administration, as well as demanding state officials pay into a slush fund. Even more darkly, it alleges with less evidence that von Göring and his loyalists gather information for blackmail against his own employees, has been involved in the kidnapping and intimidation of journalists, and even hiring assassins!"
mittel.46.a:0 "A formal investigation must be conducted immediately!"
mittel.46.b:0 "This implicates some powerful men in Berlin, quietly bury it."
mittel.46.c:0 "Göring has failed, send in Heydrich."

mittel.47.t:0 "The Corruption Investigation"
mittel.47.d:0 "It has come to our attention that Berlin has begun investigating certain financial irregularities. It is not hard to imagine who is behind this: they would have to have access to the highest level of financial planning in the Administration, likely the Alter Kämpfer who fought under von Lettow-Vorbeck, and who have resisted every change of this administration!"
mittel.47.a:0 "Quash this investigation."
mittel.47.b:0 "Contain von Göring, and quietly change administration."
mittel.47.c:0 "Göring has failed, send in Heydrich."

mittel.48.t:0 "The Kaiser's Warrant"

mittel.48.b:0 "Fetch me a ship, I shall fight this battle in court!"

mittel.49.t:0 "The Sovereign Statthalter"
mittel.49.d:0 "Hermann von Göring has refused to step down. Through his intermediary Karl Schmitt, he has argued that the Statthalter is a sovereign office, able to step outside the law, and secure with loyal members of his army, we have no easy means of resolving the crisis. Having won the Kenyatta-Solf Affair, Schmitt argues that this situation takes precedence from the affair, and therefore should be subject to the same ruling."
mittel.49.a:0 "Issue a new warrant for von Göring's arrest, for treason!"
mittel.49.b:0 "von Göring has legal precedence, step down for now."

mittel.50.t:0 "The German Response"
mittel.50.d:0 "The German government has declared von Göring's administration finished, but he still holds the reigns of power for now. He has ridden the tiger of this crisis this far, and now he cannot get off. Everywhere, the chain of command breaks down."
mittel.50.a:0 "Gott, hilf uns!"

mittel.51.t:0 "The Black Dossier"
mittel.51.d:0 "Not satisfied with the Cabinet's decision, the discontented officers of Africa have leaked their evidence and allegations to the press. While we are pushing back against the more wild, and baseless speculation, it's clear to the public an investigation is necessary."
mittel.51.a:0 "Damn! It was worth a try!"

mittel.52.t:0 "Friends in Berlin"
mittel.52.d:0 "It seems that some of our disgruntled administrators have made an appeal directly to the German Cabinet, trying to go over von Göring's head to have him removed. Fortunately, our friends in Berlin have ensured the cabinet will take no action, for now."
mittel.52.a:0 "Traitors in our midst, but friends in Berlin."

mittel.53.t:0 "The Muckrackers"
mittel.53.d:0 "While our friends in the government dismissed the accusations presented to it, it was leaked to the press. The honour of the Statthalter has been impinged, and this has given strength to the numerous journalists scuttling about Africa hoping to be the 'next E.D. Morel'."
mittel.53.a:0 "Damn them all!"

mittel.54.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.54.d:0 "With von Göring gone, we must select a new Statthalter. While he is disgraced, there is still hope for a New Colonial Regime to bring order to the colony. Or, perhaps the old ways, advocated by the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft are best. Or lastly, reform may be the only way to prevent exactly this kind of behaviour."
mittel.54.a:0 "The New Colonial Regime stays!"
mittel.54.b:0 "The Old Guard knows best!"
mittel.54.c:0 "Reform is the new way forward!"

mittel.55.t:0 "An NKR Statthalter"
mittel.55.d:0 "While von Göring may be disgraced, our larger colonial project for Mittelafrika remains. We still need strong, forward thinking leadership to take over. Who can we trust?"

mittel.56.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.56.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Major General Ernst Jünger as our new Statthalter. Awarded the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg, Jünger is something of a renaissance man. He is both an accomplished author, with his best seller "Storm of Steel" and an educated entomologist, using his time in Africa to discover and document numerous species, while introducing our Askari to 'stormtrooper tactics'. Jünger broke with the German Army after a dispute carried through a series of articles published in military journals in the mid-20s.\n\nUnable to convince the General Staff to adopt his views, he took a transfer to Africa, where he was more free to implement his theories on the importance of psychology in modern warfare. A member of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Ernst Jünger will bring what he calls a "new spirit of adventure" to the colonisation of Africa, as well as help us reform our infantry tactics."
mittel.56.a:0 "All hail the New Statthalter!"

mittel.57.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.57.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Franz Ritter von Epp as our Statthalter. A former General and current politician, Ritter von Epp fought in the Herero uprising and the ensuing repression, and earned the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg. After the war, Chancellor Ludendorf appointed him as the first postwar governor of Kamerun. Returning to Germany after serving as governor for three years, Ritter von Epp turned to politics, funding the creation of several patriotic newspapers, and serving in the Bavarian chamber of Imperial Counsellors. Ritter von Epp has never tried to hide his close ties to the Ludendorf dictatorship, and remains an outspoken apologist for Ludendorf. He is a controversial, almost belligerent figure, but the Kaiser has decided a fighting man is what Africa needs. A supporter of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Franz Ritter brings years of military experience and service to his post. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."
mittel.57.a:0 "Welcome to Afrika, von Epp."

mittel.58.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.58.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Fritz Thyssen as our Statthalter. The owner of the United Steel Works, Thyssen is a towering figure in the world of German Commerce, having served as the head of the German Iron and Steel Industry Association and as a board member of the Reichsbank. He's also been active in politics, providing financial support to right-wing parties and newspapers. He breaks from the right however in his outspoken support for higher wages and benefits for workers. He believes, like Bismarck before him, that the threat of Socialism can be averted by assuring a decent standard of living for it's workers. Thyssen claims it has the added benefit that well paid workers can purchase more German-made products, stimulating the economy. Some are calling this model of paying workers high enough wages to purchase industrial output and ensure loyalty 'Thyssenism.' Frtitz Thyssen has long been associated with the Neue Kolonialregierung, with rumours circulating that he helped fund Hermann von Göring's rise in politics, or that he was involved in the financial slush fund alleged in the 'Black Dossier'. None of these allegations have been proven yet, and the Kaiser has appointed Thyssen to the position of Statthalter, with a special eye to increase mining output in the Congo. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."

mittel.59.e:0 "Erwin Rommel, a Fine Armoured Commander."

mittel.60.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.60.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Commodore Ludwig Bockholt as our new Statthalter. Bockholt is best known for his daring resupply of General von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg. The young commander Bockholt flew the Airship L 59 "Die Afrika-schiff" from Jamboli Airstation in Bulgaria to the Mahange plateau in Tanjanika, after a grueling 100 hour flight across the deserts of Egypt and Sudan. The voyage resupplied our armies in Afrika with new weapons, ammunition, and most critically, quinine, that helped keep our armies in good fighting order until the Peace with Honour. It was the only resupply of East Afrika during the war, and holds other distinctions such as the longest military flight record, and flying the first aerial resupply mission. Because the mission was a one-way trip, Buckholt served the rest of the war as a naval infantry officer in the East Afrikan Theatre. After the war, Commodore Bockholt continued to refine his aerial resupply tactics and equipment, creating air mobile and later paratrooper naval infantry units. Despite such an innovative spirit, he is one of the leading officers of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and proved to be a thorn in the side of Statthalter von Göring, clashing with him frequently on the direction, and command of Mittelafrika's Air Force. With Bockholt as our Statthalter, we can expect Mittelafrika to maintain world class aerial infantry. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."
mittel.60.a:0 "All hail the New Statthalter!"

mittel.61.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.61.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Generaloberst Georg Kraut as our new Statthalter. During the Weltkrieg, Kraut was one of the most senior officers in East Afrika, after Generals von Lettow-Vorbeck and Wahle. He took command of the battles of Killamanjaro, Saliata Hill and Latema Nek, leading the troops to victory each time. After the war, he took divisional command, and put down rebellions in the Upper Kongo and Ruvuma Valley. In 1925, he would be the one to negotiate the entry of German troops into British East Africa, and conduct the occupation. Later, he would become commander of all armed forces in Mittelafrika. To the extent that the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft has a leader, it's him. With Generaloberst Georg Kraut in command, we can expect to continue the finest German military traditions. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."
mittel.61.a:0 "It's time for a return to the Old Ways."

mittel.62.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.62.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Dr. Rudolf Asmis as our new Statthalter. Dr. Asmis is a jurist with a long career in the Reichskolonialamt. He has served as a district officer in Togoland, Consul to the Belgian Congo, Counsellor to the General Government of Belgium, delegate to the Shanghai Convention, and most recently, head of the Reichkolonialamt. His most notable, and controversial work has been with his policy of 'Bezirksleiterrecht,' a policy of legitimizing and formalizing local and tribal law, and giving district officers the power to defer to this law in place of German Law. This has had been tried in Samoa with some success in reducing conflict with the locals. With such a long history in Imperial and Foreign affairs, he naturally has a close relationship with the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and will favour their ideas in decision making. A gifted diplomat with global experience as the head of the Reichskolonialamt, Dr. Asmis is eager to see Afrika fulfil a key role in Germany's Weltpolitik. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."
mittel.62.a:0 "It's time for a responsible administration."

mittel.63.t:0 "A Reform Statthalter"
mittel.63.d:0 "Reform is the only possible way to prevent mistakes like the von Göring administration. For too long, the German residents of Africa have been without democratic representation, or relying on virutal representation from absentee votes in the Reichstag. We will set up a more democratic administration in Mittelafrika, but who shall oversee the transition?"
mittel.63.a:0 "Paul von Lettow Vorbeck, the Lion of Africa, with Theodor von Hassel, the pioneer of reform!"

mittel.64.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.64.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck as our new , with Theodor von Hassel as his Vice-Statthalter. The leader of the Reformgruppe and son of General Friedrich von Hassel. Theodor von Hassel came to Afrika as a Oberleutnant in the Schutztruppe, and served in the Maji Maji rebellion. In the Siege of the Mahenge, his group of sixty soldiers held off several thousand rebel attackers, winning him the Order of the Red Eagle. After the Maji Maji war, von Hassel left the Schutztruppe to found a coffee farm, but volunteered for service during the Weltkrieg. After the war, he returned to his coffee plantation, which has grown into one of the most successful in Tanjanika. Dissatisfied with the way settlers like him were treated, and helped into politics by his father in law, the politician Jacob Jebsen, Theodor von Hassel spent years agitating on behalf of settlers' rights to democratic representation, as well as economic and political rights.The Kaiser has seen this man represents the will of the white and educated native population of Africa, and has deemed him worthy of being Statthalter. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration. To oversee the democratic transition of Mittelafrika the Kaiser has sent our national hero Paul von Lettow Vorbeck back to the African continent, which has led to celebrations across the colony."
mittel.64.a:0 "It's time to reform our administration."

mittel.66.t:0 "Granting Autonomy to the Kingdoms"
mittel.66.d:0 "The first step to ensuring the stability of our new Africa, is granting more autonomy to the most powerful African kings under our influence. By granting autonomy to these troublesome regions, we will be essentialy eliminating all chances for rebellion against our rule and eliminating the option of our administration to collapse."
mittel.66.a:0 "This will make the administration of Africa far easier."

mittel.67.t:0 "Restoring Self-Rule to the British"
mittel.67.d:0 "When we seized the British holdings in Africa during the British Revolution, we did it under the legal pretence of restoring responsible government to these areas. Now, over a decade later, we can finally fulfil our promise and grant the white British settlers in these areas self-rule. This will have the benefit of dealing with the Royal Veterans Association, who has been a troublesome political force in our administration for a long time, and will make our administration ever more stable."
mittel.67.a:0 "Responsible government has been restored."

mittel.68.t:0 "Retaliation for the Black Dossier"
mittel.68.d:0 "Our administration has maintained its now sovereign rule only by the skin of its teeth. The corruption inquiry could have seen von Göring and many of our senior officials spend the rest of their lives in jail. We now have the opportunity to return the favour. While an official retaliation would be difficult, we can use our growing criminal network, the 'Lion Society', to seek retaliation against these conspirators, and reinforce our rule of Mittelafrika."
mittel.68.a:0 "Vengance is mine!"
mittel.68.b:0 "Turn the other cheek."

mittel.69.t:0 "Our First Target"
mittel.69.d:0 "Our first suspect for the Black Dossier is Georg Kraut, one of Von Lettow-Vorbeck's most trusted officers during the Weltkrieg. He is well respected for this reason and likely gave his blessing to the project. He is already quite old, and perhaps it will be easier and less suspicious to induce his retirement than to kill him. We can produce a 'black dossier' of our own, and blackmail him into retirement. The allegations may not be true, but the old man won't want to fight them at this point."
mittel.69.a:0 "He should have retired years ago..."

mittel.70.t:0 "The Hunting Accident"
mittel.70.d:0 "Our next target in retaliation for the Black Dossier investigation is Ludwig Bockholt, who frequently has butted heads with von Göring over the priorities of the air force, as well as more personal matters. Since settling in Africa, Bockholt has become an avid big game hunter. One of our men was in his latest hunting expedition, and arranged for a 'hunting accident'. He swears that he thought Bockholt was a gazelle when he shot him, and the courts shall rule in his favour."
mittel.70.a:0 "Another one bites the dust."

mittel.71.t:0 "The Death of Rudolf Asmis"
mittel.71.d:0 "The next target of our retaliation for the Black Dossier is Rudolf Asmis, a diplomat with the Foreign Office, was the one who ensured the Foreign Minister saw the accusing evidence and presented it to the cabinet. He is out of our reach often, but travels a great deal between Berlin and Daressalam. A bit of sabotage has ensured that his aircraft crashed en route to his latest diplomatic assignment."
mittel.71.a:0 "Another one down, we are almost there..."

mittel.72.t:0 "The Final Target"
mittel.72.d:0 "We have long known that the officer clique behind the 'black dossier' must have been someone in the highest reaches of our administration. The source of the leak is even more embarrassing than expected. Von Göring's own brother, Albert, is the source. He has been staying in Africa under the fake name 'Albert von Epstein' a name based off of the Göring family's Jewish doctor and godfather. Rather than an ambitious conspirator, it seems he was motivated by a genuine crisis of conscience."
mittel.72.a:0 "We can't kill him, family is family."

mittel.73.t:0 "A Shady Meeting"
mittel.73.d:0 "Some of the members of our 'Lion Society' have been contacted by General Doihara Kenji of Japan, and say he has an interesting proposal for us. He will sell us opium grown in Manchuria at a discount rate, which we could then smuggle back home to Germany at considerable profit."
mittel.73.a:0 "It is an offer..."
mittel.73.b:0 "We can refuse, actually!"

mittel.74.t:0 "A Triumph of Espionage"
mittel.74.d:0 "A programme created by General Doihara Kenji to distribute narcotics to our enemies has seen its greatest success yet. It appears that the German colony of Mittelafrika is rife with corruption, and its administrator has proven willing to smuggle cheap opium into Germany for us. Every morning the German newspapers are filled with the scandals of misspent youth, and the widespread drug usage is certain to weaken their army and war industry."
mittel.74.a:0 "Huzzah!"

mittel.75.t:0 "An Opium Epidemic"
mittel.75.d:0 "Recently, the use of opium by the general populace, and even our own troops has skyrocketed. Police are still investigating the cause of the outbreak, but it appears the street price is much lower than it used to be. We still haven't been able to find the source, but our efforts are now focused on containing the effects of the outbreak."
mittel.75.a:0 "What is German society coming to?"

mittel.76.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Berlin"
mittel.76.d:0 "Our Neue Völkerschau has debuted to public acclaim in Berlin. Over 1 million people attended over the week, and the successes of our administration were on display, alongside 1,000 performers and animals. The show has increased our standing with the German government and people, as well as brought in a sizeable Income."
mittel.76.a:0 "Hurrah!"

mittel.77.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Berlin"
mittel.77.d:0 "The Huns in Africa have copied our ethnological exhibition! While it may be much larger in scale than ours, it lacks any of the elevating or moral character. In fact, the whole show ranges from the crudest of racism, to outright pornography with topless dancers performing fanciful, invented 'courtship dances.' Despite these numerous flaws, over 1 million people attended over the week."
mittel.77.a:0 "There's no accounting for taste."

mittel.78.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Vienna"
mittel.78.d:0 "The Germans in Africa have produced an extraordinary ethnological exposition, showcasing the primitive customs of over 1,000 performers from over 100 different tribes in a zoo-like exhibition alongside elephants, lions and zebras. Tens of thousands attended the exhibit, which was found to be both educational and titillating. A testament to the effectiveness of German rule."
mittel.78.a:0 "Maybe we should have one of our own, starring our Serbian neighbours."

mittel.79.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Vienna"
mittel.79.d:0 "Our ethnological exhibition has debuted in Vienna, once again a rousing success. While the turnout could not match that of our Berlin showing, it demonstrated to Europe our success, and brought in a good deal of much needed revenue."
mittel.79.a:0 "Huzzah!"

mittel.80.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Shangai"
mittel.80.d:0 "The German colony of Mittelafrika has produced an ethnological exhibition of unparalleled size and scope, featuring over 1,000 authentic African tribesman on display, alongside numerous exotic animals. While the city's white population was pleased with the educational effects on the value of racial science, the general population, many of whom have never seen a negro before, were simply caught up in the spectacle. It's certainly one of the strangest spectacles to ever grace the city."
mittel.80.a:0 "A good time was had by all."

mittel.81.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Shangai"
mittel.81.d:0 "One of our more unusual venues for our Völkerschau has been Shanghai. While usually this sort of entertainment and education appeals only to the more racially-minded societies, it apparently was considered especially exotic in those foreign lands, and brought us in a great deal of money."
mittel.81.a:0 "Money is good."

mittel.82.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Constantinople"
mittel.82.d:0 "The Germans have put on a fantastic live show, part carnival and part zoo. It's got over 1,000 authentic African Tribesmen and women, and exotic animals. Despite protests from some of the cities Imams that the show is dehumanizing, comparing it to a 'human zoo', the show drew in over one hundred thousand attendees."
mittel.82.a:0 "It's all good clean fun."

mittel.83.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Constantinople"
mittel.83.d:0 "Our Neue Völkerschau debuted in Constantinople to a great turnout. Despite protests from some of the cities Imams that the show is dehumanizing, comparing it to a 'human zoo', the show drew in over one hundred thousand attendees."
mittel.83.a:0 "Another great show."

mittel.84.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in London"
mittel.84.d:0 "The German colony of Mittelafrika's acclaimed ethnological exhibition has come to London. For years, such a showing would have been impossible under the rigid dogma of socialism, but now, once again, the British public can enjoy the benefits of science and the civilising mission. While no one can doubt the show was splendid, it did raise some of concern about the current state of the Empire, or the lack thereof."
mittel.84.a:0 "I wish we had our own empire back..."

mittel.85.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in London"
mittel.85.d:0 "Our famed Völkerschau arrived in London, but rather then the usual appreciation for our civilising mission, our show seemed to inflame British nostalgia for their empire and own civilising mission. Talk of this has reached our own British population, and they've gotten some of their old imperial swagger back."
mittel.85.a:0 "Not all of them are winners."

mittel.86.t:0 "Food from Mittelafrika"
mittel.86.d:0 "Thanks to the initiative of the New Colonial Administration, Mittelafrika is now producing grains and canned food in significant quantities, enough so that it relieves some of the pressure on our domestic industry. Without the New Colonial Administration, this kind of benefit would be impossible!"
mittel.86.a:0 "Never another Schweinemord!"

mittel.87.t:0 "Farmers Resist Our Policy"
mittel.87.d:0 "Our policy of encouraging the cultivation of cheap staples for export to Germany at below market prices has created unrest with both native farmers and white planters, giving them a rare common cause against our administration."
mittel.87.a:0 "Send in the Schutztruppe!"

mittel.88.t:0 "Guns from Mittelafrika"
mittel.88.d:0 "Our New Colonial Administration in Africa has seen gains in light industrialisation using cheap and even forced labour for industrial production. This has significantly reduced the cost of manufacturing, and provided us with additional equipment."
mittel.88.a:0 "You can never have enough guns!"

mittel.89.t:0 "Resistance in the Factories"
mittel.89.d:0 "Workers in our new factories are discontent, complaining about long hours, poor safety standards, stolen wages and violence against workers who speak out. It is becoming a problem in the urban centres, and some fear it may lead to the spread of syndicalism. Fortunately for now, the workers remain disorganised."
mittel.89.a:0 "And violence will keep them that way."

mittel.90.t:0 "Resistance to the War Economy"
mittel.90.d:0 "Shifting to a war economy has pushed our colonial population and our armies to their limit. They are ready, but they are not happy with wartime restrictions in a time of peace!"
mittel.90.a:0 "Come on, where's your patriotism?"

mittel.91.t:0 "African Divisions Programme"
mittel.91.d:0 "To provide real support to Germany from our seat in Mittelafrika, we must provide them with well-trained African divisions. To do this we will start the 'African Divisions' programme which will train men to fight in the European front."
mittel.91.a:0 "For Kaiser and Vaterland!"

mittel.92.t:0 "First African Divisions Arrive"
mittel.92.d:0 "Under the reforms of our New Colonial Regime in Africa, African recruits will not simply be placed in colonial policing roles, but provide new divisions for our army in Europe. The extra manpower is welcome, given the tense situation in Europe."
mittel.92.a:0 "Excellent!"

mittel.93.t:0 "Elite African Cavalry Arrive"
mittel.93.d:0 "Recruited from the best the continent has to offer and trained in survival tactics in the harsh environment of Africa these divisions will fight with elan and spirit."
mittel.93.a:0 "Wait till the French see this!"

mittel.94.t:0 "Motorised African Divisions Arrive"
mittel.94.d:0 "Though there were doubts it was possible, our African administration has trained two divisions worth of drivers and gunners from African recruits on the Statthalter's personal insistence. They join a growing body of divisions that are entirely moved by machine power."
mittel.94.a:0 "I'd never thought I'd see that!"

mittel.95.t:0 "Mutara III Visits Göttingen University"
mittel.95.d:0 "Prince Karl Mutara III of Rudahigwa has returned from a tour of the University of Göttingen in Lower Saxony. He was shown our latest discoveries in physics, spoke with the Professors of African Languages, and was shown the Göttingen State and University Library. It all made a strong impression on him, and he has urged his people to adopt the natural sciences of Europe, and provided for the creation of a library in Kigali."
mittel.95.a:0 "A model to his people."

mittel.96.t:0 "Sultan Khalifa II Visits Singapur"
mittel.96.d:0 "Sultan Khalifa II bin Harub Al-Said has returned from a tour of the fortifications and harbours of Singapur and Malta. He spoke at length with his attaché for the tour, Captain Otto Schiewind. At the end of the tour, the two issued a report to the Admiralty comparing the similar situations of Singapur, Malta, and Zanzibar, calling it the 'Singapur of Africa'. The Island of Zanzibar control access to our capital city of Daressalam, and to the Mozambique Channel. Despite its strategic location, the islands are underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in Europe and Asia. In response to the report, the Admiralty has funded naval fortifications in Sanzibar, and improvements to the harbour to serve as a primary base for the Kriegsmarine in the event of a war in the Indian Ocean."
mittel.96.a:0 "And with almost no cost to ourselves!"

mittel.97.t:0 "King Pedro VII Visits Cologne Cathedral"
mittel.97.d:0 "King Pedro VII Alfonso of Kongo has returned from a tour of Germany and Europe, where he attendend mass in Cologne Cathedral, as well as St. Peter's in Rome. The result has been a renewed interest in Catholic missionary efforts in the Kongo, especially from the German and Italian states. There have already been mass conversions of entire villages. To make matters worse, the Portuguese have lodged a diplomatic complaint about our treatment of the exiled king."
mittel.97.a:0 "I thought they liked when Africans were good Catholics?"

mittel.98.t:0 "The Skull of Chief Mkwawa"
mittel.98.d:0 "During a royal tour of Germany, the young Chief Adam Sapi of the Wahehe people lodged an awkward request. During our subjugation of East Africa, their tribal leader Chief Mkwavinyika Munyigumba Mwamuyinga, conducted a campaign of military resistance against our rule for 8 long years. After his death, his head was cut off and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. As part of his tour, Chief Sapi requested to visit the museum and see the skull. He asks that it be returned with him to Tanganjika. The Wahehe have superstitions about the disposal of remains, and wish to give his skull an honourable burial."
mittel.98.a:0 "What's a skull to good relations?"
mittel.98.b:0 "It is the principle of the thing! It is a prize of war!"

mittel.99.t:0 "Germany Returns the Skull of Chief Mkwawa"
mittel.99.d:0 "In a ceremony today in Kalenga, with a festive spirit, the Governor of Tanjanika returned the skull of Chief Mkwawa to the current Chief Adam Sapi of the Wahehe. Mkwawa was a fierce rebel during the early part of our rule of Africa. It took years to surround him, at which point he committed suicide to avoid capture. His skull was removed, and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. It has now been returned, as a sign of good will, to ensure the friendliness and cooperation of the Wahehe people."
mittel.99.a:0 "Let us bury the past together."

mittel.100.t:0 "Germany Refuses to Return the Skull of Chief Mkwawa"
mittel.100.d:0 "We've encountered a bit of a diplomatic faux pas. During one of his sponsored royal tours, Chief Adam Sepi of the Wahehe requested the return of his predecessor's skull, currently kept in the Bremen Anthropological Museum. The skull belongs to Chief Mkwawa, who was a rebel against German rule and beheaded by Commander Tom von Prince, who sent the skull to the Museum's collection. The Wahehe are very respectful of their ancestors, and believe that with the skull in such a disrespectful state, it is certain to anger the spirits. Unfortunately, the German government has refused the return of the skull as a matter of principle, creating discontent even beyond the Wahehe tribe."
mittel.100.a:0 "Berlin is always making trouble!"

mittel.101.t:0 "The Kabaka of Buganda Visits the Prussian Military Academy."
mittel.101.d:0 "The young Kabaka of Buganda, Eduard Friedrich Mutesa II has just completed a tour of the Kriegsakadamie in Prussia. Like all young men, he has a natural enthusiasm for all things martial, and the German Army is the finest in the world. Young Friedrich has decided to study at the Kriegsakadamie, and encouraged promising young men in Budanda and Uganda to do the same."
mittel.101.a:0 "Gott mitt uns!"

mittel.102.t:0 "The Man in the High Castle"
mittel.102.d:0 "The vanishing funds, the atrocities commited by our adminstrators, the thousands of mercenaries funneled into Ostafrika; we should have seen this coming, yet we did not. Hermann von Goering has declared his castle in Tanga the new seat of power of “his” Mittelafrikan Reich and has declared war on us. He has clearly premeditated this act of rebellion for months, as the entire Hauptstadtterritorium is now overwhelmed by his mercenary forces and Askari loyalists. Many members of the NKR have also deserted to join his cause, leaving the DKG practically alone to combat this crisis. Such a blatant attack on our legitimacy is doing massive damage to our already precarious grip on the rest of our territories, not to mention those of our protectorates. Stirrings of rebellion are everywhere. This may well be the end of Mittelafrika as we have come to know it..."
mittel.102.a:0 "Goering has doomed us all."

mittel.1002.t:0 "Silence washes over Mittelafrika"
mittel.1002.d:0 "The colonial monstrosity that is Mittelafrika is burning. Across the colony, seperatist movements and rebellious states rise up from within, tearing the massive, continent-spanning colony apart from the inside. With former colonial head Hermann Göring having been recalled to the Kaiserreich for higher duties, the colony has been hit with wave after wave of instability and ineptitude, and now it has become all too much for the fragile patchwork of colonies and local chiefdoms to stand against. The communications from Dar-Es-Salaam have grown quiet as a dark silence washes over the continent, like the eerie calm before a storm...."

mittel.103.t:0 "Anniversary of Mawiha"
mittel.103.d:0 "Today is the anniversary of the Battle of Mahiwa, the most decisive battle of the East Afrika Campaign. In the battle, the King's African Rifles were encircled and surrendered by the armies of Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck from the south and east, and Kurt Wahle's from the north and west. The British lost nearly 4,000 men in the operation, to a loss of less than 200 German Askari.\n\nThe battle paved the way to our invasion and conquest of Mozambique in 1918. Since 1922, it has been a state holiday in Mittelafrika. It has been celebrated throughout the colony, but especially in Daressalam, with parades and military drills, as it reminds every citizen and subject of our need and capacity for military excellence."

mittel.104.t:0 "Death of Bernhard Dernburg"
mittel.104.d:0 "Sad news arrived from Berlin today. Bernhard Dernburg, former head of the Imperial Colonial Office, has died. Bernhard served for only three years, from 1907 to 1910, but he had an enormous influence on the development of the colony of German East Afrika, that would eventually form the core of Mittelafrika. It was his reforms that firmly established the first fully secular education system on the Afrikan continent, a legacy we have tried, with difficulty, to spread throughout Mittelafrika. A small ceremony was held in Daressalam in his honour, with a street being renamed Bernhard Dernburg-Strasse."

mittel.108.t:0 "Black Monday!"
mittel.108.d:0 "A massive breakdown has occurred yesterday in Berlin's stock market. The German economy is in tatters, and our economy is sure to follow. We must cut back on much of our spending and immediately look for ways to fix our economy. The Kolonialgesellshaft is forced to take out a loan of 300 million Reichsmarks to compensate our private investors, which is now added to our national debt. It could take many years to recover from this..."

mittel.109.t:0 "African Investments!"
mittel.109.d:0 "While we lost our African holdings in the Weltkrieg, we still operate a large, informal economic empire in Germany's African territories. Profits from the mining, rubber and ivory trade strengthen the economy of our small yet great country."

mittel.110.d:0 "Our economic empire in German Africa has just been seized by the Mittelafrikan government!

mittel.111.t:0 "New Political Parties"
mittel.111.d:0 "Now that our country has elections, it is no longer fitting that our politics are made up of military factions.

mittel.112.t:0 "A Split in the Reformgruppe!"
mittel.112.d:0 "Now that their reforms have been implemented, the Reformgruppe has been struggling to come up with what to do next and this has caused a split in the party!

mittel.114.d:0 "One of the Afrikan Aktion Partei's main election promises was ending this farce called 'Mittelafrikan democracy' and restoring the Statthalter's ability to deliver fast action without worrying about what his white subjects think. To do so, we must abolish the shortlived Landtag and restore direct control of affairs to the Statthalter."

mittel.115.d:0 "The Kaiser has decided to appoint his own loyal man instead of listening to the will of the Mittelafrikan people...

mittel.125.t:0 "The Kenyan Church"
mittel.125.d:0 "When we moved into British Territory in 1925, the British hold on the territory was dangerously weak after 7 years of warfare. In the same year British strikes coincided with a series of protests by the natives in British East Africa; the Church of Scotland Mission declared the practice of female circumcision banned for Christians, labelling it 'sexual mutilation of women'. For the dominant ethnic group of the region, the Kikuyu, the practice, which they call irua, is the 'conditio sine qua non' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion. They felt so strongly about this that it has caused a rupture within the Christian community in Kikuyuland. The Anglican Church quickly followed the Scottish Church in banning the practice, but in response, the Kikuyu have created their own 'African Churches'. They've established their own theological schools, which have become a hotbed of Kikuyu nationalism. At the same time, with the fall of Britain to socialism, there is a schism within the Anglican and Scottish churches themselves. In Canterbury Cathedral, the Union of Britain has declared Archbishop John Hobbis Harris as the head of worldwide Anglican communion, while in Ottawa the British Monarch has declared, under his authority as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang to be the head of the communion. The Scottish Kirk has seen a similar schism. It is impossible to tell for certain who any given Anglican minister believes is the real head of the church, and they might be listening to Archbishop Harris, who is a campaigner against imperialism in Africa."

Stumpf was an outspoken opponent of the Kikuyu practice of irua, and her body was discovered to have been cut in the traditional Kikuyu manner before she was murdered. Naturally, we suspect Kikuyu religious extremists."
mittel.126.a:0 "Barbaric."

mittel.127.t:0 "The Kenyan Highlands Settlement Policy"
mittel.127.d:0 "The Highlands of Kenya are one of the few areas of Africa suitable to white settlement. The rare combination of cool uplands combined with healthy soil creates a climate almost like that of Europe, and excellent for farming. It is no wonder that the land there is in high demand.\n\nUnfortunately, it's long been economically underused. The British settlers have proven more interested in establishing themselves as landholders and letting the native Kikuyu do the labour. If we opened the land up to small German farmers squeezed by the Junker estates, we could improve productivity and increase our influence on the region, but it would also make the land shortage even more intense."
mittel.127.a:0 "Allow for German settlement."
mittel.127.b:0 "Let us keep the British protectorates British."

mittel.128.t:0 "Land Crisis in the Kenyan Highlands"
mittel.128.d:0 "Allowing German settlement in the Highlands of Kenia has only exacerbated the problems in the region, as it has set off land speculation, with prices rising out of control, and conflicts and disputes breaking out over the demarcation of a few metres of land. To make matters worse, for the local Kikuyu tribes, a man is not considered an adult until he owns at least some land. There are tribal territories set aside for this, but they are massively overcrowded, with most of them owning no land and working on British plantations. Additionally, an increasing amount of land within the tribal areas is monopolised by the local chiefs. This land shortage is creating unrest on all sides."

mittel.129.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events, unknown gunmen shot and killed Senior Chief Waruhiu wa Kung'u this afternoon in broad daylight. Waruhiu was our senior collaborative official among the Kikuyu. Our security officials have been been noting the rise of religious, oath based violence among the Kikuyu. Supposedly, they conduct 'magic rituals' under the cover of darkness, and swear oaths to kill white settlers. By killing Senior Chief Waruhiu, who had a body guard and was held in high esteem by our administration, they've demonstrated there's almost no one in the Kenian Highlands they couldn't kill, right now."
mittel.129.a:0 "Declare a state of emergency in Kenya."

mittel.130.t:0 "Land Reclamation Completed"
mittel.130.d:0 "Our land reclamation project in Kenia is complete. By draining marshes, applying pesticides, building dams and diverting rivers, we've increased the amount of land we can have under cultivation, slightly reducing the land crisis there."

mittel.131.d:0 "Chafing under the restrictions, curfews and random searches of the state of emergency, men of the Kikuyu, Enbu, and Meru ethnic communities have started leaving their homes and taking to the rugged hills and mountains of the Aberdare range, Mount Kenya, and the Mau Escarpment. From there, they have begun an insurgency campaign against us and the British, targeting colonial civilians and soldiers alike, and using the most barbaric and brutal tactics imaginable."

mittel.167.d:0 "Born after the absorption of the French colonies gained by treaty after the Weltkrieg, Mittelafrika is a massive swath of land. Composed of cities, chiefdoms, kingdoms, farmlands, jungles, savannahs, deserts and more; it covers half of the Dark Continent. A complex web of treaties, agreements and tacit understandings, the colony, while stable, is remarkably unprofitable; in no part due to the continued protection of the British colonies. Placed under our suzerainity following the 1925 British revolution, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Zambia’s administration is funded by Mittelafrikan profits. Our Statthalter Wilhelm Solf and Heinrich Schnee of Ostafrika have thus far managed to keep our bureaucracy on good terms with our French, British and Belgian patrons, but trouble is brewing. The old guard is challenged by a new clique who seeks to centralise Mittelafrika further under German rule and within them is a sinister cabal of extremists led by Hermann von Göring, who want to exploit our good patrons for their personal gain. Solf is getting old, time is fleeting, and von Göring promises untold riches to his adherents no matter the cost. But could that cost be too great for Mittelafrika to pay? And will the Kaiser allow von Göring to take such a risk?"

mittel.169.d:0 "We have defeated the Portuguese in Africa, and they have started negotiations for surrender, it now time to decide what it is we want to get out of this war. The old guard suggests we should take only northern Mozambique, as it was our original goal in this war. Members of the NKR suggest establishing security zones in Mozambique and Angola, while the most radical members of our administration say we should strip Portugal of all African holdings. We must remember that we will uphold our deal with the South Africans and grant them southern Mozambique, what shall be done?"

What began as a formal, typical address quickly took a change in tone, with the Statthalter abruptly denouncing the "damaging particularist elements" in the continent. The speech ended with an official proclamation: All treaties, titles, and priviliges held by the African kingdoms and their subjects are now "unconditionally forfeit", with all former holders of titles expected to swear an oath of loyalty within the week. This marks a sharp turn in Mittelafrikan colonial policy, and is sure to have serious implications. We've stopped receiving communications from most of the continent, presumably as they protest..."

The man would not even get an audience were he not a war hero, but the Kaiser's advisors see something about his demeanor that suggests he is deathly serious.

We are already on the brink of a new war with the Syndicalists and the Russians, but if we can just keep our colonies together for long enough, perhaps we will be strong enough to repeat the impossible.

The chief figures within the NKR, namely Heydrich and von Epp, have realized that Göring is nothing but a madman hellbent on total domination within Mittelafrika as solace for his removal from the German political scene. Seeking to ride the wave of popularity generated by his Young Officer Clique, Göring planned to take the position of Staathalter and rapidly push towards total sovereignty from the Kaiserreich, full parity with the Kaiser’s position, and seeks to expand his colonial fiefdom until in consumes all of Africa. These insane dreams could only have been invented within the mind of a madman, and the NKR has begun to fully understand just how dangerous Göring truly is. \n\nThis information getting out however would definitely hurt the NKR’s chances of winning the Staathalter’s position given that the likely reaction to Göring’s schemes coming out would be a resurgence to the RFG’s recently rising power as a harsh and opposite reaction to Göring’s tyranny. With this in mind, the NKR has decided to keep quiet on this kernel of truth until all the necessary evidence is compiled and ready to present, for they will only get one shot at taking down Göring and his schemes."

For centuries, he and his fellow native Afrikans had been forced to sit on the sidelines while the Europeans decided the world order and declared his people's destinies with a flick of the pen, or the barrel of a gun.

mafsettlers.9.a:0 "Wipe Them Out!"
mafsettlers.9.b:0 "Demand the Concessions!"

mafsettlers.10.t:0 "Dealing with the British"
mafsettlers.10.d:0 "Before the Weltkrieg, The British Empire had massive holdings in Africa, with them leaving many settlers across the continent, now many of them are now within Mittelafrika. Much of our Government is saying we should Germanise them and move on, but some are saying that Germanising them could lead to a conflict between the two parties." {Leave the British, they've already had it hard enough"
mafsettlers.10.a:0 "They lost, get over it!"
mafsettlers.10.b:0 "Grant them concessions to keep them quiet."
mafsettlers.10.c:0 "Shut them up by force."

mafsettlers.11.t:0 "Dealing with the Mercenaries"
mafsettlers.11.d:0 "With NKR’s recent win in the political battle for control of Mittelafrika, the new administration has moved to address the colony’s outdated military. One of the ways they hope to deal with our glaring manpower issue is to finalize our policy on the use of mercenaries. The main three attitudes that have appeared on this issue have been predictable. There are the staunch professonalist war hawks of the old guard that want nothing to do with the unruly and brutish mercs. Then there are the moderates who feel that limited applications of mercenaries, particularly as special forces where the harsh training would hone their rough edges. Finally, the radicals seek to hire as many mercenaries as possible to help solve our glut of skilled soldiers, regardless of the penalties. The debate shall rage for hours, but ultimately, the choice lies with the Hauptmann."
mafsettlers.11.a:0 "We shall spend the lion’s share of our military budget to hire these brave men in droves"
mafsettlers.11.b:0 "We shall only hire the best of the best for our special forces and colonial guard"
mafsettlers.11.c:0 "We shall not waste our funds on these unruly brutes"

mafsettlers.12.t:0 "Dealing with the Mercenaries"
mafsettlers.12.d:0 "With the DKG maintaining their dominance in the recent power struggle in Mittelafrika, the administration moves to continue its military reforms. Dominated by the old guard and weltkrieg veterans, the DKG is slow to accept any new thoughts when it comes to the battlefield, but recent whiffs of instability like the Mau-Mau revolt have seemed to light a fire under them, driving them to be more open to new ideas. Among the new ideas that require debate is the party’s official stance on the use of mercenaries. In the fierce debate, three main camps have formed on what to do. There are the old guard war hawks that want little to do with the savage and undisciplined bushmen, who fear any mercenary influence would infect the rest of our armed forces. Then there are the moderates who feel that limited applications of mercenaries, particularly as support groups where their unprofessionalism wouldn’t wreak such havoc. Finally, the radicals seek to hire as many mercenaries as possible to help solve our glut of skilled soldiers, regardless of the risk they may pose to our reputation or efficacy. The final choice, however, lies in the hands of the Hauptmann."
mafsettlers.12.a:0 "We shall revive the mercenary spirit of the Landsknechts and Hessians"
mafsettlers.12.b:0 "Only allow mercenaries into support roles and special units"
mafsettlers.12.c:0 "The Kaiser’s colonial forces will not be sullied by brigands"

mittel.1188.d:0 "Now that we no longer have to answer to Germany, we can finally take our Legacy as rulers of this continent. Supreme Leader Göring, who is the King of Mittelafrika in all, but name can finally take up his mantle as King of all of Afrika. However, some within our government advise against this radical move. However, the Supreme Leader does not often have his will ignored, and any who advise against this could be dealt with. As well, declaring Göring King would anger many, including the local tribes who have their own monarchies and the British who are loyal to the British King. Should Göring make himself the true, unchallenged ruler of Afrika?"
mittel.1188.a:0 "On second thought..."
mittel.1188.b:0 "Long live the King of Afrika!"

mittel.1189.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.1189.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Generaloberst Erwin Rommel as our new Statthalter. During the Weltkreig he served in Italy and was awarded the Pour le Mérite. He Served in the infantry, though he would later come to identify with a much more powerful form of warfare, Armoured Warfare. This however gained him many enemies within the High Command, who wanted to keep Germany practicing more traditional forms of warfare. After he published a renowned book on warfare, the Kaiser sent him to Africa to keep him out of the way of the High Command. However, this only strengthened his position in the high command as his doctrine of armoured warfare was perfectly suited the vast African plains. And now, with the Statthalter gone Rommel has been primed to take charge over Mittelafrika, and with him in Charge Mittelafrika’s warfare will be brought into the modern age. "
mittel.1189.a:0 "It's time for a return to the Old Ways."

mafdeathgang.1.t:0 "Kaiser Wilhelm III Takes the Throne"
mafdeathgang.1.d:0 "With the death of Kaiser Wilhelm I, Kaiser Wilhelm II has taken the throne. The coronation has taken place, and the new African Emperor is now Kasier Wilhelm II. Cheers from the coronation members erupted, and the Kaiser of Germany has only tightened the bond with the Afrikanisches Kaiserreich."
mafdeathgang.1.a:0 "Hail to thee in the victor's wreath!"

mafcollapse.2.t:0 "Collapse Starting"
mafcollapse.2.d:0 "Mittelafrika has always been an unstable colony, no one can deny that, be it a German administrator, an English businessman, a French settler, a native or anyone else.\n\nHowever, never before has the colony been in such turmoil as it is today, with stability in shreds and insurgencies on the rise, our administration seems undeniably doomed to failure despite our best efforts. Throughout the Kaiser's vast African possessions, various armed groups are struggling for power. Among them are native armed cliques composed of our former soldiers and  several socialist and republican militia fighting against the locals colonials administrations which is desperately trying to maintain order, seasoned mercenaries rebelling against their former employers, UMK businessmen fearing for their possessions, ghosts of the past rising in Kenya, the ever-determined Goering regrouping his followers near our capital, the Old Guard at its wits' end grouping in Sudwestafrika, panicked Schutztruppe garrisons abandoning their positions, native chiefs with dubious loyalty seemingly turning against us.\n\nThe disastrous situation has reached a point of no return and only a miracle can save us."
mafcollapse.2.a:0 "It wasn't supposed to happen like this!"

mafinternal.1.t:0 "Dealing with Natives in Westafrika"
mafinternal.1.d:0 "Besides the colonial administration, the natives still hold influence in Westafrika, mainly two large groups opposed to each other, so we can only support one of them that will help us in our centralization process.\n\nThe first is the influential and wealthy Afro-Brazilian Olympios family residing in Togo, led by their unscrupulous patriarch Sylvanus Olympio, as one of the most influential families in Africa their support and numerous connections will surely be of great help to us, especially financially. The second choice would be to favor the conservative tribal chiefs of Northern Westafrika, unofficially led by Jonathan Savi of Tové, they have a great influence on the political level and on the native people of Westafrika, and are greatly attached to the African tradition of the different native people, although not as rich as the Olympios, their support would also be of great help and would greatly improve our relations with the natives.\n\nWhat will be our final choice?"
mafinternal.1.a:0 "Sylvanus Olympio and his family's wealth is the most profitable option"
mafinternal.1.b:0 "Jonathan Savi of Tové and the Northern Chiefs is the safest option"

mafinternal.2.t:0 "The Situation in Westafrika"
mafinternal.2.d:0 "In Westafrika there are three main administrators belonging to the three main groups of settlers that we could support in order to contribute to our centralization process.\n\nThe first is the German Duke Nikolaus von Oldenburg, a loyal and experienced subject of the Kaiser, he believes that as a German colonial possession it is natural and logical for Westafrika to be ruled mainly by Germans, his ideals are consistent with our need for centralization. The second is the Frenchman Jules Bréviè, the most social and populist of the three administrators, he promotes the establishment of social programs and welfare for settlers and natives and the extension of the rights of the natives in order to avoid their opposition and to contain possible future revolts, supporting him will surely greatly improve our relations with the natives The last one is the English Arnold Hodsons who is in favor of moderation and status-quo, he is a good middle ground choice between the three men and will surely ensure the stability of the colony. Our last option would be to support none of the three in order to not create more conflicts between the three groups of settlers living in Westafrika.\n\nWho should we support ?"
mafinternal.2.a:0 "The German Nikolaus von Oldenburg"
mafinternal.2.b:0 "The French Jules Brévié"
mafinternal.2.c:0 "The Englishman Arnold Hodson"
mafinternal.2.e:0 "Let's strike a balance"

mafinternal.3.t:0 "The Fate of the Jews of Madagascar and Uganda"
mafinternal.3.d:0 "In Uganda and Madagascar in particular, the Jewish populations are growing day by day, bringing new labor and new investors to Mittelafrika, this would not have been a problem if these populations had not developed separatist and independence tendencies in the process, with some of their craziest leaders calling for the establishment of a state of Israel in Buganda or Madagascar, we need to solve this problem if we want to successfully continue our centralization process.\n\nOur first option would be to spend money on developing the Jewish communities in the colonies, building synagogues for example, in order to make Jews feel more integrated into our society, which will logically reduce their separatist tendencies. The second would be to block all Jewish immigration from outside Mittelafrika, to apply a forced cultural integration process for any Jew wishing to remain in Mittelafrika and to arrest any Jewish leaders expressing separatist views.\n\nWhat plans should we implement?"
mafinternal.3.a:0 "Start allocating funds for the Jews"
mafinternal.3.b:0 "Block all Jewish immigration and begin the process of assimilation."

mafinternal.4.t:0 "The Situation of The Native Malagasy in Madagascar"
mafinternal.4.d:0 "The island of Madagascar, Heydrich's stronghold, is inhabited by a large majority of Malagasy, a people who, because of the strong French presence on the island, have developed republican, monarchist and even socialist tendencies, which Heydrich's grand plans seem to have reinforced. We must find a way to resolve their separatist tendencies if we want our centralization process to be effective in the region, we can use two main approaches.\n\nThe first would be to extend the autonomy and privileges of the various local Malagasy chiefs in order to ensure their loyalty to Dar es Salaam and to reduce separatist tendencies among the natives. The second approach would be to launch large-scale reprisal programs against all republican, socialist, monarchist, and separatist native groups and to launch propaganda campaigns reminding the natives of the danger of ideologies such as syndicalism.\n\nWhat orders should we give to the administration of Madagascar? "
mafinternal.4.a:0 "Prepare for negotiations with tribal leaders"
mafinternal.4.b:0 "Put the natives in their place once and for all!"

mafinternal.5.t:0 "An Agreement with Mutesa?"
mafinternal.5.d:0 "The Uganda region is currently ruled on our behalf by King Mutasa II, who has autonomy along with several other tribal leaders. However, Mutasa as King of Uganda has more influence and power than any local chief, ruling over several chiefs who are vassals to him, giving him considerable influence, which gets in the way of our centralization process.\n\nWe have two main choices, the first would be to negotiate with Mutasa to help our local administration and centralization process in exchange for an increase in autonomy, a guarantee that we will not touch his privileges and titles, and that we will let him control his army. The second, more radical approach would be to revoke his privileges once and for all and bring the region under direct colonial control, which will undoubtedly anger the tribal leaders but will greatly assist our centralization process.\n\nBoth choices are considered viable by our administration, so the final choice remains."
mafinternal.5.a:0 "Let's make an agreement with the King"
mafinternal.5.b:0 "Direct control is much more preferable"

mafinternal.6.t:0 "Stance on the Old Masters"
mafinternal.6.d:0 "The Flandro-Wallonians have long been the masters of the Congo, but with the recent missteps of the Ryckmans Regime and with the needs of both Dar-Es-Salaam and Berlin evolving and growing every day, we must decide on a position towards these failing colonials. The Congo is the linchpin of the Mittelafrikan project,  and stands as one of the most important holdings for the Kaisererich. Since our arrival in this jungle, we have slowly worked to replace as many Flandro-Wallonian colonials as possible with loyal German officers, but this has caused great tension with our supposed allies. We must decide now and going forward if we are to continue this process of forced Germanification, or should we limit these plans for now so as to utilize the expertise and experience of our Belgian friends."
mafinternal.6.a:0 "The Congo is one of our most important holdings. Work with them."
mafinternal.6.b:0 "Their Vrijstaat is failing. We do not need these washed-up imperialists."

mafinternal.7.t:0 "Stance on the Évolués"
mafinternal.7.d:0 "The Évolués are, outside of native monarchies and nobility, the closest thing the native Congolese had to an elevated class. Functioning as educated and self-made elites, these Évolué families stand as the middle and upper class of Congolese African society. With small fortunes, their own businesses, higher education, and deep political ties, the Évolués are a sort of bridge between colonial and native. Now we must decide if it is time to repair and utilize this bridge, or shall we burn it down so as to remove any ideas of social and economic mobility from the minds of the native Congolese. They hold great influence and sway over their fellow Congolese, and we must keep this in mind as we make our decision."
mafinternal.7.a:0 "Leave them to their fortunes and ask for their expertise and assistance."
mafinternal.7.b:0 "Tell these uppity natives to remember their station. Crush any that forget."

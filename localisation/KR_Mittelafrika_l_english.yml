### Ideas ###
MAF_Colonial_Nation:0 "Colonial Government"
MAF_Colonial_Nation_desc:0 "Despite its very limited autonomy in dealings with African neighbours, such as Somalia, Mittelafrika is a colony; its entire state apparatus hinging on and maintained by German power, a budget prepared in Berlin, and its currency pegged to the German Mark.\n§RNOTE:§! Despite not being a subject, Mittelafrika is still subservient to Berlin's Authority and cannot declare independent wars"

MAF_Flandro-Wallonian_Influence:0 "Flandro-Wallonian Influence"

MAF_Flandro-Wallonian_Condominium:0 "Flandro-Wallonian Condominium"
MAF_Legal_Chaos:0 "Legal Chaos"
MAF_Imminent_Collapse:0 "Imminent Collapse"
MAF_Imminent_Collapse_desc:0 "We have managed to ignite the entire continent into war! Unless we crush them all swiftly, our entire apparatus of state will implode and Mittelafrika will cease to exist."
MAF_Secular_Education:0 "Secular Education System"
MAF_Cash_Crops_idea:0 "Cash Crops"
MAF_Good_Supply:0 "Efficient Supply Usage"
MAF_Honorary_Officers_idea:0 "Honorary Officers"
MAF_Debt:0 "Tremendous Debt"
MAF_Debt_desc:0 "Despite having access to the vast resources of all German colonial holdings combined with all French Sub-Saharan colonies, Mittelafrika has been massively in debt for years. The 1925 British revolution saw us embark on several large-scale interventions to secure the protection of Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda and Zambia without much thought being put in how to budget for it all. Our employees are underpaid and their employees in turn recieve even less, much to the detriment of the Deutsch-Kolonialgesellschaft and Heinrich Schnee. The Neue Kolonialregierung promises a radical new approach to resolve this issue and Goering continues to be a thorn in our side, so unless we find a solution to this soon our legitimacy is constantly being undercut because of it."
MAF_Protected1:0 "Protected Economy"

MAF_Anglo_Volunteers2:0 "British Volunteers"
MAF_Opium_Profit:0 "Opium Profit"
MAF_Opium_Epidemic:0 "Opium Epidemic"
MAF_Human_Trafficking:0 "Condemned For Human Trafficking"
MAF_Human_Trafficking_desc:0 "We have received condemnation from the Foreign Office in Berlin over our part to play in the rampant human trafficking ring that infests Mittelafrika. If we are going to remain in power, we must at least retain the facade of legality."
MAF_Hands_Cutting:0 "Condemned for Human Rights Violations"
MAF_Hands_Cutting_desc: "Berlin has sent an official condemnation of our current administration, citing our “gross disregard for the sanctity of human life.” Berlin is angry, our international image has taken a hit, and the people protest over our government’s actions, claiming we have blood on our hands."
MAF_Missing_Funds:0 "Funds Dissappearing?"
MAF_Missing_Funds_desc:0 "Significant amounts of funds are missing from our treasury. While it would take a large-scale corruption investigation to pinpoint the culprit, all signs point to Hermann von Goering and his Souverainisten. We don't know what Goering plans to do with all these Reichsmarks, §Rbut whatever it is, it could prove to be disastrous in the future.§!\n"
MAF_old_new_guard_divide:0 "The Rift Between the Old Guard and the Young Officers Clique"
MAF_old_new_guard_divide_desc:0 "Long has the Kaiserreich now held a stake in Africa, first obtaining Westafrika, Südwestafrika, and Kamerun in 1884 at the Berlin Conference. In the decades that have followed, the Kaiser’s ambitions have only grown and now, after the Weltkrieg and its wake, the Iron Cross of Germany looms over two-thirds of the continent. Since its inception, a loyal clique of staunchly monarchist generals and bureaucrats have stood as the scions of this new colonial realm, in the form of the DKG. \n\nAs the years have passed however, these aging veterans and relics of a year long passed have only gotten older, and with it, their grip over Africa has slipped - a fact sharply shown in their need to form a soft ruling coalition with elements of the Reformgrüppe shortly after Germany’s victory in the Weltkrieg. \n\nIn the aftermath of this necessary decision, the NKG - a rival group of aging, hawkish colonial administrators mixed with various elements of the less radical younger officers - broke off from the DKG to form their own clique poised to take the position of Staathalter for themselves. This syncretic clique of both young and old officers seeks to centralize and further Germanize Mittelafrika, but their goals are far from extremist or radical in nature. That dubious honor goes to the Young Officers Clique, who have increasingly become called the ‘Souveränisten’. Consisting of various disillusioned Mittelafrican youth officers who joined the colonial service to further the Pride of the Fatherland only to have the dark and decayed nature of Mittelafrika revealed to them and led, though unofficially, by Hermann Goering, these ‘Souveränisten’ are a menace to Mittelafrikan stability. \n\nThis divide between a dying Old Guard falling to various flavors of young officer and civilian movements form the basis of Mittelafrica’s internal political divisions today, and if they do not get a grip on the situation soon, the stalking opportunists like the integrated French, the autonomous Anglos, and even the evermore-angry natives may seize on their chance to strike during the chaos."

MAF_new_army:0 "New Army"
MAF_new_army_desc:0 "With their recent success at uprooting the long-standing dominance of the DKG Old Guard, the NKR has come to fully control the Mittelafrikan military, greatly aiding them in their centralization efforts. From our Askari and ground troops to our navy and airforce, each and every facet of our armed forces are now controlled and dictated by the NKR and their loyal officers, generals, and admirals. We have entered a new world of modern warfare, and with the stalwart ideas of the NKR guiding us, we shall meet these new modern expectations of an army as our men are forged into Africa’s elite."
MAF_Vorbeck_idea:0 "Spirit of von Lettow-Vorbeck"
MAF_Landtag:0 "Afrikan Landtag"
MAF_Black_Pilots:0 "African Pilots"
MAF_Mahiwa_1_0:0 "Legacy of Mahiwa"
MAF_Mahiwa_1_0_desc:0 "At the battle of Mahiwa in 1917 we defeated commander Jacob van Deventer alongside our commander Paul van Lettow-Vorbeck. The Mittelafrikan Schutztruppen and Askari have not been defeated since! We are a proud army capable of defending Germany’s territory in Africa: Remember Mahiwa shall be our battlecry! Remember the Battle of the Bees!"
MAF_Mahiwa_1_1:0 "Legacy of Mahiwa"

Remember the Battle of the Bees!"
MAF_Mercenary_Pilots:0 "Reliance on Mercenaries"
MAF_Mercenary_Pilots_desc:0 "The Schutztruppen of Ost, West and Südwestafrika are not enough to secure the expansive Mittelafrikan state. Our administration thus has to rely on mercenaries to fill in the gaps. They serve as an auxillary police force and, on top of being very expensive, reportedly commit atrocities during their “policing actions” within our colonial borders. This situation is becoming intolerable and something must be done about it soon."
MAF_Mercenary_Pilots_air:0 "Reliance on Mercenaries"

MAF_Belgian_Investors:0 "Flandro-Wallonian Investors"
MAF_Belgian_Investors_desc:0 "Flandro-Wallonian investors within our territories have retained much of their pre-war influence due to the high amount of Belgian businesses and factories that remained after the Weltkrieg. We will need to deal with them soon, as their current influence has a negative effect on our country."
MAF_British_Protectorates:0 "British Protectorates"
MAF_British_Protectorates_desc:0 "After the 1925 revolution we secured all British holdings in Africa save southern Rhodesia and South Africa. Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda have been our dependencies ever since, with Ghana being incorporated into Westafrika and northern Rhodesia under a more direct millitary administration following a brief skirmish with the Entente. As the Kolonialgesellshaft owes a great deal to the Neue Kolonialclique and the Souverainisten for their quick and decisive independent action, it remains a fact that we did nothing when they moved on our behalf. This fact has been empowering both of them ever since, despite the sizable portion of the budget that we now have to devote to maintaining our grip on the British territories being on their heads as well. We should move to do something about this soon."
MAF_border_shit_show:0 "Border Raids"
MAF_border_shit_show_desc:0 "There are ongoing bandit raids along our border, we are sure the Portuguese government is behind them. They will continue to be a thorn in out side until we bring a stop to them."
MAF_MEFO:0 "MEFO Bills"
MAF_MEFO_desc:0 "Fritz Thyssen's company owns a significant portion of Mittelafrika now. This currently has no effect on the colony, §Rbut it could prove to be disastrous in the future.§!\n"
MAF_profiteering:0 "Profiteering"
MAF_profiteering_desc:0 "Mittelafrika grows rich off of our weapons sales, much to the displeasure of the natives."

MAF_thecharteroflabor2:0 "The Charter of Labor"
MAF_thecharteroflabor2_desc:0 "Mittelafrika lacks a unified legislation on labor, and Germany has an excellent example to provide. We will simply extend to Mittelafrika the sections of the German Civil Code relating to labor, achieving the double goal of administrative standardization and shutting up the SPD back home."

MAF_post_collapse_army:0 "'Unconventional' Army"
MAF_post_collapse_army_desc:0 "Armies created following the collapse of Mittelafrika aren't conventional. They don't have the same ability to defend and hold the line as more standard divisions, but are better able to move and fight in the harsh conditions of Africa. Additionally, while conventional factories are few and far between there are ample opportunities to scavenge equipment, providing a steady if limited supply of arms."

### Decisions ###
MAF_debt_actions:0 "Dealing with our Debt"
MAF_debt_actions_desc:0 "The Deutsche Kolonialgesellshaft has come up with a plan to deal with our crippling debt. Statthalter [MAF.GetLeader] has consulted with economic secretary Rudolf Asmis who has proposed a number of options that are available to us right now. It seems that all of them will hurt Mittelafrika and empower the Neuen Kolonialclique in the short term, but this is a sacrifice we must be willing to make in order to start thinking about expansion again."
MAF_sell_crops:0 "Buy and Resell Staple Crops"
MAF_sell_crops_desc:0 "Asmis has observed that it has been proven difficult for our settlers to sell their produce on the international market. Embargoes by the Entente limit their potential buyers from the get-go and our policy regarding who can export what are byzantine and confusing. To make matters worse, the French settlers within our territories trade on pre-Weltkrieg terms and are largely evading our taxes this way. We must seek to remedy this by purchasing crops directly from our settlers and reselling them ourselves. One price, one market, one Mittelafrika."
MAF_layoffs:0 "Lay off French Civil Servants"
MAF_layoffs_desc:0 "Our administration continues to pay the salaries of the French civil servants within our colonial territory. Asmis has proposed that we simply fire them. Competent German replacements will follow suit once our financial situation improves."
MAF_export_weapons:0 "Sell Guns to the Reichspakt"
MAF_export_weapons_desc:0 "While we do not possess the industrial capacity of a modern European nation by any means, Asmis has still recommended we approach our broader Reichspakt alliance to purchase Mittelafrikan guns. Everyone needs guns, anyhow."
MAF_press_natives:0 "Press the Natives to Work Harder"
MAF_press_natives_desc:0 "Perhaps the most obvious solution Asmis has presented us, he suggests that we engage in a widespread program to “encourage” our African population to do their damnedbest for the Vaterland.  While this will definitely hurt our stability in the short term, we can rest assured that the whip cracks out of love."
MAF_sell_plantations:0 "Privatise Plantations Across the Colony"
MAF_sell_plantations_desc:0 "While the Neue Kolonialclique has issued a formal protest against this proposal by Asmis, the Kolonialgesellshaft sees no harm in selling off state-owned plantations to private investors. Whatever industrial capacity we might lose from it in the long term we can surely make up for through short-term profits."
MAF_crime_actions:0 "Illicit Activities"
MAF_crime_actions_desc:0 "The Black Monday crisis has thrown our bureau of the budget into complete disarray. Only Asmis is still convinced we can stay the course by continuing with his proposals, but almost everyone else in the Mittelafrikan administration is calling for radical, drastic action. The Neue Kolonialclique and in particular the Souverainisten within them have already approached us with some "alternative" means of dealing with our skyrocketing debt. Whether we actually listen to them is up to us, but there is little doubt that without implementing at least some of their ideas Mittelafrika will spiral into more instability than it can ever hope to recover from."
MAF_grow_opium:0 "Grow Opium in Ostafrika"
MAF_grow_opium_desc:0 "Hermann von Göring, ever looking for ways to increase his influence in Mittelafrika, has apparently been in talk with his compatriots in Ostasien, who have collectively approached us with a suggestion. Göring owns several plantations in Tanga and Dodoma which he is willing to donate to the state so long as we assist him in growing Afghan opium on them, to then sell on the black market. He assures is that we will not get in legal trouble if Berlin gets word of this, but the consequences of introducing so much illegal opium onto our streets are totally unforseeable."
MAF_human_trafficking:0 "Human Trafficking"
MAF_human_trafficking_desc:0 "The Duke of Oldenburg, who adminsters Westafrika on behalf of us, has spoken to Harvey Firestone of Firestone rubber in Liberia. The two men offer a lucrative business plan in which we support Monrovia’s rubber plantations by providing Firestone with a yearly quotum of labourers which they will pay us handsomely for. When asked what kind of labourers they were looking for, a representative of Firestone slipped us some American dollars and requested us to not inquire further on the matter. It seems obvious what is being suggested here. The Kolonialgesellshaft is debating how to move forward."
MAF_blood_diamonds:0 "Blood Diamonds"
MAF_blood_diamonds_desc:0 "Pierre Ryckmans and the representatives of the Flandro-Wallonian Congolese government have contacted us with a deal. They promise to practically double their output in precious metals so long as we skip the mandatory oversight checks of the Force Publique for the next few years. These checks are normally carried out to ensure ethical human conduct in exploitation ventures in the Congo so skipping them would mean the Flandro-Wallonian administration is no longer being held accountable for the way they treat their African workers."
MAF_embezzle_funds:0 "Embezzle Funds"
MAF_embezzle_funds_desc:0 "Unbeknownst to everyone in Mittelafrika, the Souverainisten have been restaffing key posts in Ostafrika for quite some time now. Hermann von Göring is debating whether or not to make some money that would normally go to our protectorates “disappear” to secretly invest it back into the German colonies, as well as some other projects of his."
MAF_MEFO_bills:0 "Issue MEFO bills"
MAF_MEFO_bills_desc:0 "Fritz Thyssen of the Metallurgische Forschungsgesellschaft has proposed us with a deal. He wishes to issue special bills that function as bailout bonds on behalf of his company to our government, which would alleviate our debt tremendously. The problem the Kolonialgesellshaft foresees however is that Thyssen would effectively own large swathes of Mittelafrika and he is known to associate with Hermann von Göring, so the administration is torn on whether or not to pursue this venture."
MAF_NKR_actions:0 "Implementing the Four Year Plan"
MAF_NKR_actions_desc:0 "The Deutsch-Kolonialgesellschaft has finally been ousted and the Neue Kolonialclique is in power. The time has come to implement our four-year plan to forge Mittelafrika into Germania's iron fist against syndicalism. Arthur Zimmerman has proposed a number of projects which could potentially triple our industrial output, but the remnants of the DKG that are still within our administration whine and complain that going down this path will "upset the delicate balance" of the colony. This is, of course, of no concern to us. There are millions of Africans that can work and bleed for the Vaterland. If some should die in the process, our administration considers that an acceptable loss."
MAF_mining_campaigns:0 "Mining Campaigns"
MAF_mining_campaigns_desc:0 "We can massively increase the mining output of Mittelafrika through the use of extra-legal contract labour. We would ship in natives from across the colony to work in "Kaiserbergwerken" where they will be lodged until their contract ends. The pay we give them is always less than the amount of Reichsmarks we charge for the lodging, so we profit off of our workers forever until they are inevitably replaced."
MAF_skull_roads:0 "Schädelstraßen"
MAF_skull_roads_desc:0 "Much of Mittelafrika is comprised of inefficient tribal villages with little in the way of industrial capacity. We will use the Schutztruppen and some mercenary attachments to clear out these villages and press the natives to build "Kaiserstraßen" to connect our colonial settlements. Word has spread that the locals call them "Schädelstraßen", but this is nonsense, of course. Skulls make for very poor roadtiles."
MAF_logging_campaigns:0 "Logging Campaigns"
MAF_logging_campaigns_desc:0 "Mittelafrika could be the foremost producer of wood in the world! All it takes is some extra-legal labour, a few garrisons here and there, and our "Kaiser-Holzfällerlager" will bring us great profits. Those trees were only standing in our way, anyway."
MAF_kaiser_factories:0 "Kaiser Factories"
MAF_kaiser_factories_desc:0 "A minor minister has suggested that we construct arnament manufactories directly inside native villages, effectively converting them into processing plants with pre-built lodging. He calls these manufactories "Kaiserfabriken". Zimmerman had commended the administrator and has given the Neue Kolonialclique the go-ahead to start building."
MAF_settlement_cities:0 "Settlement Cities"
MAF_settlement_cities_desc:0 "The Statthalter and Zimmerman have been discussing an expansion of German settlement in Mittelafrika. Our administration can employ extra-legal contractors to construct "Siedlungsstädte" which are almost entirely self-sufficient, clear wasteful terrain and disperse idle natives. Clearly this is an excellent idea which we should move forward on."
MAF_Settler_actions:0 "Dealing with the Europeans"
MAF_Settler_actions_desc:0 "With our debt finally paid off and the corruption in our government flushed out, the Deutsch-Kolonialgesellschaft can finally start addressing a problem that has plagued Mittelafrika since its inception; the status of our non-German European population. We currently have four different groups that we need to re-examine our relationship with. First is the French, who despite legally being Mittelafrikans and thus subject to German laws enjoy many of their pre-Weltkrieg priveleges. Second is the Flandro-Wallonians, who have a disproportionate amount of influence in our colony’s financial and industrial sectors. Third is the British, who we spend a large portion of our annual budget on protecting from native uprisings and syndicalism. Fourth is the miscellanious European mercenaries that serve as our auxillaries in the Schutztruppen, for which they recieve more pay than our regular police forces and garrisons."
MAF_the_french:0 "The French"
MAF_the_french_desc:0 "The French territories of Gabon and Tschad are under our direct control, Elfenbeinküste and Dahomey are administered by Westafrika. All the same, the French have too much influence in our colonies. We need to come up with a solution that satisfies both parties."
MAF_the_belgians:0 "The Flandro-Wallonians"
MAF_the_belgians_desc:0 "The Flandro-Wallonian captains of industry have expanded their influence far beyond the Congo and have nearly monopolished certain areas of resource exploitation within Mittelafrika. While they are Mitteleuropan citizens, the Kolonialgesellschaft thinks it is best if we negotiate some kind of deal with them to consolidate the position of Germany within its own colonies. Perhaps we can even resolve the matter of Flandro-Wallonian Congolese autonomy if we come to a satisfactory agreement."
MAF_the_british:0 "The British"
MAF_the_british_desc:0 "The British protectates are costly ventures and securing them means diverting our already overstretched Schutztruppen away from defending Mittelafrika proper. The Kolonialgesellschaft will contact the British under our suzerainity and negotiate a deal with them."
MAF_NKRSettler_actions:0 "Dealing with the Europeans"
MAF_NKRSettler_actions_desc:0 "With our debt finally paid off and the perfidious Alter Kämpfer disgraced by the corruption investigating, the Neue Kolonialclique can finally call itself the Neue Kolonialregierung. It is time to put forward our plans for the Europeans within Mittelafrika and those in our protectorates. Millitarising the colony to combat syndicalism in Europe is our number one priority, which conveniently gives us carte blanche in many ventures the old DKG would not dare to embark on. Well, according to ourselves, anyway."
MAF_the_frenchNKR:0 "The French"
MAF_the_frenchNKR_desc:0 "The French are Mittelafrikans now and they damn well better listen to Mittelafrikan law. We will end their priveleges and demand they either step down to the level of our German administrators or face the consequences and become second-class citizens. As well as they should be."
MAF_the_belgiansNKR:0 "The Flandro-Wallonians"
MAF_the_belgiansNKR_desc:0 "The Flandro-Wallonians run away with our natural resources and pocket the profits for themselves. No more. We will approach their government with an ultimatum to either pay up or shut up and become integrated into Mittelafrika proper. Perhaps we might even do both."
MAF_the_britishNKR:0 "The British"
MAF_the_britishNKR_desc:0 "Our arrangement with the British is expensive, inefficient and above all entirely based upon a pipe dream of theirs. Brittania of old is gone, it is time their colonial governors accept this. We shall organise a conference to pursuade the protectorates to either unconditionally side with us in the conflict to come or submit to German governance like Nordrhodesien in 1925."
MAF_RFG_actions:0 "Rethinking our Administration"
MAF_RFG_actions_desc:0 "The Kaiser has agreed to finally democratise Mittelafrika. We must not let this golden opportunity go to waste; there is much to be done. Although the Reformgruppe functions as a united front against the autocrats in the NKR and the reactionaries in the DKG, it is actually comprised of many different factions who all have their own plans for the future of the colony. We shall consider our options carefully as we move forward to make the Dark Continent brighter."
MAF_fight_NKR:0 "Combat NKR Influence"
MAF_fight_NKR_desc:0 "The corruption investigation may be over and Goering may be under house arrest in Tanga, but many “blameless” NKR members still work to counter our reforms. The right wing of the Reformgruppe wants to continue conducting smaller corruption investigations to combat their remaining influence."
MAF_encourage_investment:0 "Market Liberalisation"
MAF_encourage_investment_desc:0 "Under the DKG Mittelafrika was almost a command economy; free trade did exist, but only within the Mitteleuropan market bloc. The center wing of the Reformgruppe wants to explore other markets such as the Entente and the Co-Prosperty sphere in a program of general economic liberalisation."
MAF_catholic_missions:0 "Encourage Catholic Missions"
MAF_catholic_missions_desc:0 "A coalition of center-left Catholics within the Reformgruppe (mainly comprised of Flandro-Wallonian and French Europeans) wants the government to sponsor Catholic missions within its territories. While rightists have voiced their concern about a potential neglect of Protestant values, the center-left has assured us that these missions will only be carried out in areas where Catholicism is already prevalent. Mittelafrika is vast after all, there is room for all good Christians here."
MAF_worker_conditions:0 "Improve Worker Conditions"
MAF_worker_conditions_desc:0 "The left-wing of the Reformgruppe, led by Albert von Göring, has proposed a social democratic reform package to improve the conditions of both native and European workers within Mittelafrika. Most of the center and right-wing is sceptical about the costs of this proposal, but von Göring assures as that it will benefit all of Mittelafrika in the long term."
MAF_do_journalism:0 "Spread Word of our Success"
MAF_do_journalism_desc:0 "The center-left and left-wing of the Reformgruppe is quite active in the media. Casimir Zagourski and Albert von Göring want to engage in a widespreas propaganda campaign within Mittelafrika and beyond to advertise our planned reforms. Von Göring laughed away concerns about associations with his last name, stating: “Not all that is Goering is evil.”"
MAF_convince_DKG:0 "Assuage the Fears of the Alter Kämpfer"
MAF_convince_DKG_desc:0 "While many of the Alter Kämpfer are sympathetic to our cause, some are still on the fence about democratising Mittelafrika. If we devote some resources towards convincing them that our reforms are better for everybody, perhaps they might be pursuaded to join us. We except they would never go much further than the right-wing our the Reformgruppe, but that is no concern to us."
MAF_the_mercs:0 "The Mercenaries"
MAF_the_mercs_desc:0 "Due to how expansive Mittelafrika has become after the 1925 British revolution, our Schutztruppen and Polizeitruppen have increasingly ben supplemented by European mercenaries. Their pay is higher than our regular soldiers’, they are known to commit atrocities when they are without German oversight and their quality can vary wildly. The Kolonialgesellschaft has to come to a decision as to what to do about all of this."
MAF_the_mercsNKR:0 "The Mercenaries"
MAF_the_mercsNKR_desc:0 "Due to how expansive Mittelafrika has become after the 1925 British revolution, our Schutztruppen and Polizeitruppen have increasingly ben supplemented by European mercenaries. While the NKR takes no issue with any of these reported “atrocities”, the fact remains that private millitary power is expensive and we have no control over what kind of mercenaries come to work for us at the moment. Several plans have been put forward to resolve this matter, so that the Mittelafrikan army may serve the Vaterland better."

MAF_collapse_actions:0 "Preventing the Collapse of Mittekafrika"
MAF_collapse_actions_desc:0 "The complete collapse of the Mittelafrikan Project is an ever-looming threat, for this mangled, interconnected mire of political treaties and diplomatic facades is always standing on the brink of total chaos. Work to consolidate this megacolony and fix the issues that ail it, less the whole rotten structure comes crashing down. \nCurrent Collapse Progress is at §R[GetMAFCollapse]§!\n Current Monthly Collapse Increase is at §R[GetMAFCollapseMonthly]§!\n §GMittelafrika Can Only Collapse After 1938§!\n §RAllowing the Variable to get over 20 will result in Mittelafrikan Collapse§!"

MAF_paramount_chief_action:0 "Solidify Relations with Paramount Chiefs"
MAF_paramount_chief_action_desc:0 "Like many other imperial powers who lorded over swathes of Africa, our Kaiserreich has long maintained treaties and deals with the local great Chiefs and Kings that locally rule over much of the land within our colonial borders. These ‘Paramount Chiefs’ are our link to the wider, interconnected link of African tribal politics that has continued under our rule, and as such, we must solidify good relations with these rulers. Without their support, we won’t be able to effectively administer the colony on a local level, and chaos and instability would surely follow suit as more Africans decide to ignore colonial law."
MAF_internal_protectorates_action:0 "Establish Internal Protectorates"
MAF_internal_protectorates_action_desc:0 "A series of internal protectorates should be made, cordoning off the more rebellious and more numerous ethnic groups that refuse to submit to colonial will into their own semi-autonomous states. Though they will be far from sovereign or free from colonial influence, hopefully this token gesture will alleviate the worst of their complaints."
MAF_Status_of_African_Citizenship:0 "Status of African Citizenship"
MAF_Status_of_African_Citizenship_desc:0 "Granting full citizenship may be a highly controversial affair, especially with those who still cling to the status quo or their own twisted delusions of grandeur. However, with Africans making up the vast and overwhelming majority of the total population of Mittelafrika, granting this token nod of equality and culpability on the government’s part should go a long way with soothing colonial-native relations. Sure, we will have to be actually responsible for their well-being now, at least tacitly, but at least it will keep them from open revolt...maybe."
MAF_Enfranchise_Africans_in_Local_Elections:0 "Enfranchise Africans in Local Elections"
MAF_Enfranchise_Africans_in_Local_Elections_desc:0 "While still a far-cry from total national enfranchisement, allowing ethnic Africans to vote in local elections and referendums regarding their local communities would likely go a long way at securing Mittelafrikan stability."
MAF_Allow_Local_Elections:0 "Allow Local Elections"
MAF_Allow_Local_Elections_desc:0 "Now that we have enfranchised the massive African majority so that they may have a greater say in their local, community level governments, it is now time to formally organize local elections across Mittelafrika. Every autonomy, protectorate, and other local subdivision of our government shall hold simultaneous local elections for the first time ever, bringing about a new era for Mittelafrika’s African citizens. For once, they all shall have a say, no matter how meager, in the general governance of their territory - at least nominally."
MAF_Create_Colonial_Subdivisions:0 "Create Colonial Subdivisions"
MAF_Create_Colonial_Subdivisions_desc:0 "Our megacolony is a massive quagmire of disorganization and decaying chains of supply and command, for the Dark Continent seems to swallow any attempt at civilization. To alleviate this collapsing command hierarchy, a new series of internal colonial subdivisions shall be made. Each shall be similar to the free-states we gave the Anglos, or the separate administrations of Westafika or Nordrhodesien, though these new territories will be far smaller and far less autonomous, and still nominally under the united banner of Mitttelafrika proper. By further delegating, we shall divide and conquer these wild lands once and for all."
MAF_An_African_Lower_House:0 "An African Lower House"
MAF_An_African_Lower_House_desc:0 "Once an unthinkable proposition, perhaps the time has finally come to allow the native Africans a true say in the government through elected representation. By creating a new lower house in the Mittelafrikan Landtag, one separate from the longstanding upper house full of colonials, military men, and the bulk of the Old Guard, Africans in Mittelafrika would finally be an official part of the overarching national government, and not just relegated to local politics often derailed on a whim by the colonials. Though this lower house would most assuredly have far less actual power and sway than the upper house or the ruling Staathalter, it would likely be large enough of a political concession to keep them pacified."
MAF_Establish_Economic_Parity:0 "Establish Economic Parity"
MAF_Establish_Economic_Parity_desc:0 "To gain some ground with the native Africans without giving up more political hold over the colony, a program to establish more economic equality within Mittelafrika should be begun. By opening the doors of our economy to more native Africans while simultaneously tearing down barriers to their business-dealings and biases towards colonial merchants, we shall create a more fluid and vibrant economy for the nation while also placating much of the African population as the gateway to leaving their lives of poverty shall be opened to them."
MAF_segregate_cities:0 "Urban Segregation"
MAF_segregate_cities_desc:0 "A rather drastic solution to lower the ethnic and racial tensions that have long existed in the lands of Mittelafrika and that have only been stoked since the arrival of the colonials is to enact total segregation within the most densely populated and more cosmopolitan regions of our colony: our cities. By introducing a new color bar and a policy of ‘separate, but equal,’ we shall hopefully be able to allow all of our citizens to enjoy the benefits of our metropolises without fear of being lynched or mugged over their skin color or tribal affiliation, and more importantly, without starting more race riots and ethnic revolts and protests."

Though this lower house would most assuredly have little real power or sway at all, serving mostly as a token gesture, it would likely be large enough of a political concession to keep them pacified while the Staathalter and the rest of the colonial hierarchy focuses on the more important matters at hand."
MAF_Economic_Consessions:0 "Economic Concessions"
MAF_Economic_Consessions_desc:0 "It is far easier and less decaying to our powerbase to grant economic aid and concessions instead of political ones, for it is far less dangerous to give savages money than the right to vote. With smiling faces, we shall grant the native Africans parity and equality within our markets and business arenas, but behind the facade we will know they are as powerless as ever while being all the more pacified and easier to rule."
MAF_Emergency_Actions:0 "Emergency Government Action"
MAF_Emergency_Actions_desc:0 "Chaos has begun to grip the Mittelafrikan megacolony, and across this dark core of Africa, the illusion of our complete control has begun to rapidly falter. We must deploy emergency measures at once to save this crumbling colony, for the Kaiser’s light must not die out on this Dark Continent. Troops will be mobilized as old Askari and Weltkrieg veterans are called back into service. Emergency economic concessions and political decrees will go into immediate action in an attempt to stop the hemorrhaging. Martial law shall be declared and the beacon will be lit so that Berlin may see and send aid.

In order to stave off decay and collapse while we work to pacify and centralize this hectic region, we must walk the tightrope between these three warring factions while always remaining vigilant of the native element, for many African movements within the Grain Coast writhe for their chance at freedom. \nCurrent [CIV.GetNameWithFlag] is at §G[GetCIVCentralization]§!"

With its unique position on the Eastern Afrikan coast, it has become the centerpiece of the Mittelafrikan navy, and slowly is working to become the chief naval station in all of the Kaiserreich. To achieve this lofty goal, Governor Reinhard Heydrich has reportedly stooped to inhuman levels of cruelty to achieve stability and efficiency as he turns the island into one giant navalyard. Though the reports of his actions are few and far between, they have begun to paint a bloody picture, prompting our administration to begin poking around Heydrich’s regime. With an influx of Jewish settlers arriving on Heydrich’s behalf mixing and fighting with the local Malagasy and French, Madagaskar has found itself as the centerpiece of a multi-ethnic struggle for the island. We must work to reign in Heydrich and uncover what he has done on the island while lessening tensions with the locals one way or another lest we lost our prime naval asset in Afrika. \nCurrent [MAG.GetNameWithFlag] is at §G[GetMAGCentralization]§!"

However, though he offers work, housing, and a good life, scant reports from the island’s interior paint a vastly different picture. However, all accusations have been categorically denied by Heydrich and his administration, and every survey or inspection team we have sent to the island have either come back well-dressed, dressed in finer clothes and jewelry then they could have ever have gotten on their regular salaries, or just have not come back at all. Though it is still too early to tell what Heydrich is actually doing on his secretive island home, we must address this issue, one way or another. We can either reach out to prominent Jewish leaders both within Madagascar and outside of it, all without Heydrich being aware, to try to alleviate their grievances with our state and to figure out what Heydrich and his goons are up to in this new ‘promised land,’ or we simply can allow him and his regime to continue with their great works as-is, for if the reports are true, Heydrich’s methods will ensure the Jews are not an issue."

There are risks, the Statthalter admits, but the rewards could be astronomical."
MAF_afrikanischenotenbanken:0 "Afrikanische Notenbanken"
MAF_afrikanischenotenbanken_desc:0 "Vastly different economies and the persistence of outdated colonial currencies and barter all over the continent, not to mention the influence of the French franc and Egyptian lira, have led us to the decision of funding a network of local banks tasked with printing currency independently of one another and financing businesses at the regional level.

mittelpolitic.7.t:0 "Death of Wilhelm Solf"
mittelpolitic.7.d:0 "Saddening news has spread across Mittelafrika and the wider Kaiserreich this day, for after a long career and decades of service to his nation and the Crown, Staathalter Wilhelm Solf has passed away. A visionary that has propelled Mittelafrika into a new age of prosperity and relative peace, Solf has ruled our megacolony as the head of the DKG in a groundbreaking coalition with various elements within the Reformgruppe. Together, this administration has passed new reformative policies with each new session of Mittelafrika’s leading minds, further modernizing this once backwards relic of a colonial era long passed, and now Solf’s replacement, Heinrich Schnee, hopes to carry on his legacy. \n\nHowever, not all has been so peaceful and prosperous as many of the propaganda posters around the colony so claim, for ethnic tensions and political infighting are once again on the rise. With the Mau-Mau in open rebellion in Kenya, the Mwami antagonizing the Flandro-Wallonians in Katanga, the Muslims in Hausaland constantly rioting, and a slew of other internal issues, Mittelafrika’s once unified political stage has now broken down into a pit of political maneuvering and scheming as each faction seeks glory and power. \n\nThe chief threat to the Schnee and the DKG is the NKG, a coalition of eager young officers and disillusioned Old Guard that have rallied around figures like Franz Ritter von Epp and Reinhard Heydrich, while nominating the ever-ambitious Hermann Göring as their frontline candidate in the race for Staathalter, hoping to bank on the Göring family legacy to carry them to victory over the Old Guard of the DKG. Hermann’s father was once the governor of Südwestafrika, serving admirably, and viciously, against the Herero that long plagued the German regime, and as such the other members of the NKG believe that Göring, despite his reputation, is their best chance to steal the Staathaltership. \n\nAfter days of debate, the interim ruling council of Mittelafrika had finally agreed on a candidate to put forth, and now the rest of the colony waits to see who they have nominated. However, despite the nomination, the final choice is up to the Kaiser."

mittelpolitic.700.t:0 "The New Colonial Group"
mittelpolitic.700.d:0 "The NKR, or Neue Kolonialgruppe, stands as the main political challenge to the long standing dominance of the DKG. Composed of a few German veterans who had broken off from the DKG like Franz Ritter von Epp and Reinhard Heydrich who now lead a band of younger, more ravenous officers and soldiers in defiance of the status quo. Seeking a larger, more centralized, and more Germanized Mittelafrika, the NKG cares not for obstacles such as ‘human rights’ and the like, and instead are solely focused on increasing the Kaiserreich’s, and in turn their own power and fortunes. \n\nAs if this was not dangerous enough, the group has currently rallied around Hermann Göring, son of the infamous Butcher of the Herero and an accomplished fighter ace from the Weltkireg. In Göring, they see a useful figurehead to captipult themselves into the position of Staathaler, but a man such as Göring always has his own ambitions, even if the rest of the NKR is not aware of this yet. In secret, Göring is the head of a small group of nationalist radicals known as the ‘Souveränisten’. This group of ‘sovereignists’ secretly plot to surpass the centralization efforts of the NKR, instead seeking to build up Mittelafrika as a truly independent state that is on equal footing to the Kaiserreich. Though this is likely a fool’s errand, it has not stopped the madman Göring from drafting up plans and strategies for how to achieve his demented goals, and with his ever-growing army of young followers marching behind him, his threats may not be as hollow as once thought. \n\nRegardless of Göring’s scheming in the dark, the wider NKG still holds a great sway of influence within our government, and if Staathalter Solf soon passes like he is expected to, then the NKR would serve as the DKG’s and RFG’s main rivals in the race for picking the new Staathaler. Whether or not the NKR succeeds in their dreams of a centralized Mittelafrika, or God forbid Göring and his Souveränisten get their wish, shall soon be determined as the very destiny of this Dark Continent hands in the balance."

mittelpolitic.701.t:0 "The German Colonial Company"
mittelpolitic.701.d:0 "The DKG, or Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, has long been the dominant political force and leading party in Mittelafrika. Composed of a mix of veteran generals, honored colonial bureaucrats, and various other aging relics of the Weltkrieg era and permanent fixtures of the German colonial regime, the DKG is the staunch Old Guard of the Mittelafrikan political scene. Like an iron wall, they stand unyielding in defense of the status quo, seeking to continue the Kaiser’s Afrikan project - colonizing the swathes of Mittelafrika and reaping the profits of this expansion - without dragging the continent into chaos with excessive reform or centralization attempts. \n\nSince the fires of the Weltkrieg, the DKG has ruled over Mittelafrika, guided by the likes of Wilhelm Solf, Heinrich Schnee, and many other titans of the German colonial scene, but since the early 1920’s, these aging agents of the Kaiser have not rules alone. After a rise in tensions across Mittelafrika after the collapse of the British and French Empires that led to our colony taking on the old colonial lands of our fallen enemies, instability and unrest across the megacolony were at a fever pitch. However, after careful delegation, cooperation, and diplomacy, Staathalter Wilhelm Solf was able to arrange a groundbreaking coalition government with the Reformgruppe - a massive group of more liberal minded colonials mixed with even a few Askari and Évolués allowed within the government that are hellbent on reforming and modernizing Mittelafrika into a functional, loosely democratic state. With this unheard of cooperation between Germany’s colonial Old Guard and this Liberal-dominated clique, Mittelafrika has largely towed the main line, never veering too far from the set status quo, while occasionally passing tacitly liberal policies to maintain the coalition and keep the peace. However, with Staathalter Solf growing older and less fit to rule this wild frontier with each day, many believe that the writing is already on the wall for the DKG as the RFG seeks to spread their own wings while the DKG’s other, more hostile political enemies gather strength in the dark..."

mittelpolitic.702.t:0 "The Rift Between the Old Guard and the Young Officers Clique"
mittelpolitic.702.d:0 "Long has the Kaiserreich now held a stake in Africa, first obtaining Westafrika, Südwestafrika, and Kamerun in 1884 at the Berlin Conference. In the decades that have followed, the Kaiser’s ambitions have only grown and now, after the Weltkrieg and its wake, the Iron Cross of Germany looms over two-thirds of the continent. Since its inception, a loyal clique of staunchly monarchist generals and bureaucrats have stood as the scions of this new colonial realm, in the form of the DKG. \n\nAs the years have passed however, these aging veterans and relics of a year long passed have only gotten older, and with it, their grip over Africa has slipped - a fact sharply shown in their need to form a soft ruling coalition with elements of the Reformgrüppe shortly after Germany’s victory in the Weltkrieg. \n\nIn the aftermath of this necessary decision, the NKG - a rival group of aging, hawkish colonial administrators mixed with various elements of the less radical younger officers - broke off from the DKG to form their own clique poised to take the position of Staathalter for themselves. This syncretic clique of both young and old officers seeks to centralize and further Germanize Mittelafrika, but their goals are far from extremist or radical in nature. \n\nThat dubious honor goes to the Young Officers Clique, who have increasingly become called the ‘Souveränisten’. Consisting of various disillusioned Mittelafrikan youth officers currently within the NKG who joined the colonial service to further the Pride of the Fatherland only to have the dark and decayed nature of Mittelafrika revealed to them and led, though unofficially, by Hermann Goering, these ‘Souveränisten’ are a menace to Mittelafrikan stability. \n\nThis divide between a dying Old Guard falling to various flavors of young officer and civilian movements form the basis of Mittelafrica’s internal political divisions today, and if they do not get a grip on the situation soon, the stalking opportunists like the integrated French, the autonomous Anglos, and even the evermore-angry natives may seize on their chance to strike during the chaos."

Surrounded by his political allies from Mittelafrika as well as his surviving family and closest confidants, the body of the old, honorable Solf was lowered into the soft earth, entombed in a rosewood casket using lumber sourced from the late Staathalter’s own Mittelafrikan summer estate. With his passing, the position of Staathalter has been left temporarily vacant until a new replacement is put forth and accepted by the Kaiser, but until then, a small council of DKG officials led by Heinrich Schnee shall maintain order in the colonies.

However, this long standing autonomy is now under threat, as Mittelafrika moves ever closer in their goal to replace as many Anglos with their own German administrators as possible. With Dar-Es-Salaam pushing for this ‘Germanification’ of our freestate more heavily than ever before, we must now take an official stance on our future in Mittelafrika. We can either acquiesce the Germans in their goals, hoping that they leave some of our administrators and privileges intact, or we can attempt to deny Dar-Es-Salaam as long as people, but with the growing ambitions of both the Staathalter and Berlin, we may not be able to hold back the tide for long."

Now, our once-close allies circle us like wolves, eyeing up the riches of our Congo with hungry eyes and eager trigger-fingers. With the writing on the wall becoming clearer, we must prepare ourselves for the inevitable, but we are not fully out of options. Sure, we could roll over and let the Germans take our hard-earned and long-held colonial jewel, or we could petition the Kaiser and his colonial office itself in Berlin for aid.

They come to our colonial office offering more lucrative incentives and direct lines of revenue from their more profitable ventures run by the UMHK, as well as a renewed oath of loyalty to the German Crown, in order to have us reign in Mittelafrika. If we agree, the Congo would remain in the hands of the Flandro-Wallonians, with the Mittelafrikan administration entirely unable to move in and replace our Belgian allies, likely angering our loyal Staathalter but keeping the status-quo and stability of Mittelafrika as is. However, we could just as easily deny this delegation’s request, allowing our loyal German administration in Dar-Es-Salaam to fully take over the Congo for the might of Mittelafrika and the entire Kaiserreich.

mittel.1.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while we occupied Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war we had to punish those who joined the Entente's side. Now, many of those natives are displaced across the Mozambique border and there are many rumours that the new extremist government in Portugal is planning to arm them against us."
mittel.1.a:0 "We must prepare."

mittel.2.t:0 "The Mozambique Situation"
mittel.2.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, the situation in Africa was truly paradoxical. The war in East Africa ended in a stalemate, where the Entente occupied German East Africa, while the Germans occupied our Mozambique. Both sides recruited thousands of Africans from 'enemy' territory as porters, armed guards or soldiers, and after the war the Huns led cruel reprisal attacks on the natives that joined our side. Since then, thousands of those natives have fled over the border into Mozambique where they now live in camps. These natives are a good opportunity to sow mischief in Mittelafrika, as many of them still want revenge for what the Huns did to them."

We would get a good share of the spoils, which would be sure to please our land hungry Boer population, but the Anglophones look at Mittelafrika with suspicion and fear, while prefering Portugal as an ally. Drastic action at this point would be highly contentious, especially with the looming elections..."

We suspect that the South Africans don't want to make a momentous decision before their highly contested elections. The Boer population and their National Party favours our position and is pushing to sign the deal, while the English settlers and their Dominion Party favour the Portuguese. We should watch the upcoming elections closely, as victory or defeat for the Boers could decide this whole conflict."

Anti-Colonial activist Jomo Kenyatta has brought a class action lawsuit against former Afrikan Statthalter Wilhelm Solf.

They claim that Solf's administration harmed them through policies of illegal land seizures, and even abductions and torture, all done with Solf's knowledge and little legal basis. Quietly, the foreign office has explained to the government that such things are common and necessary in our colonial administration. They strongly urge we quash this motion."

mittel.44.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.44.d:0 "Disaster! We have been watching the litigation of Jomo Kenyatta for years with nervous anticipation, and now our worst fears have been realised. Former Statthalter Wilhelm Solf has been found liable for 'extralegal' actions taken as Statthalter. The damages were not ruinous to Solf, but it has opened a door, to theoretically limitless cases. Already, Statthalter von Göring has resigned in protest. In the aftermath, legal reform and a more 'normalised' governance of Africa is the only viable option, and the only person willing to take charge and implement these reforms is Theodor von Hassel, may God help him."
mittel.44.a:0 "Gott mitt uns."

mittel.45.t:0 "The Kenyatta-Solf Affair"
mittel.45.d:0 "Our Administration has been watching with nervous anticipation the progression of the Kenyatta-Solf Affair, in which a Kikuyu lawyer is leading a class action lawsuit against former Statthalter Wihelm Solf. Fortunately, the defence lawyer Carl Schmitt produced a novel defence, that has established a new legal precedent: "Sovereign is he who decides on the exception." The courts accepted this argument, that the Statthalter is the sovereign authority in Africa, and has the right to 'step outside' normal legal proceedings. This obviously has startling implications, and some members of our administration already eagerly anticipate a 'Sovereign Statthalter'."
mittel.45.a:0 "The Sovereign is he who decides on the exception."

mittel.46.t:0 "The Black Dossier"
mittel.46.d:0 "A group of anonymous officers and administrators in Mittelafrika have compiled documentation and evidence of illegal activity by Statthalter von Göring and presented it to the Cabinet. The evidence, if true, is very serious. According to what they allege, Statthalter von Göring has been using the generous state budget we have provided him with to buy off politicians throughout the Reichspakt in order to secure support for his administration, as well as demanding state officials pay into a slush fund. Even more darkly, it alleges with less evidence that von Göring and his loyalists gather information for blackmail against his own employees, has been involved in the kidnapping and intimidation of journalists, and even hiring assassins!"
mittel.46.a:0 "A formal investigation must be conducted immediately!"
mittel.46.b:0 "This implicates some powerful men in Berlin, quietly bury it."
mittel.46.c:0 "Göring has failed, send in Heydrich."

mittel.47.t:0 "The Corruption Investigation"
mittel.47.d:0 "It has come to our attention that Berlin has begun investigating certain financial irregularities. It is not hard to imagine who is behind this: they would have to have access to the highest level of financial planning in the Administration, likely the Alter Kämpfer who fought under von Lettow-Vorbeck, and who have resisted every change of this administration!"
mittel.47.a:0 "Quash this investigation."
mittel.47.b:0 "Contain von Göring, and quietly change administration."
mittel.47.c:0 "Göring has failed, send in Heydrich."

mittel.48.t:0 "The Kaiser's Warrant"

mittel.49.t:0 "The Sovereign Statthalter"
mittel.49.d:0 "Hermann von Göring has refused to step down. Through his intermediary Karl Schmitt, he has argued that the Statthalter is a sovereign office, able to step outside the law, and secure with loyal members of his army, we have no easy means of resolving the crisis. Having won the Kenyatta-Solf Affair, Schmitt argues that this situation takes precedence from the affair, and therefore should be subject to the same ruling."
mittel.49.a:0 "Issue a new warrant for von Göring's arrest, for treason!"
mittel.49.b:0 "von Göring has legal precedence, step down for now."

mittel.50.t:0 "The German Response"
mittel.50.d:0 "The German government has declared von Göring's administration finished, but he still holds the reigns of power for now. He has ridden the tiger of this crisis this far, and now he cannot get off. Everywhere, the chain of command breaks down."
mittel.50.a:0 "Gott, hilf uns!"

mittel.51.t:0 "The Black Dossier"
mittel.51.d:0 "Not satisfied with the Cabinet's decision, the discontented officers of Africa have leaked their evidence and allegations to the press. While we are pushing back against the more wild, and baseless speculation, it's clear to the public an investigation is necessary."
mittel.51.a:0 "Damn! It was worth a try!"

mittel.52.t:0 "Friends in Berlin"
mittel.52.d:0 "It seems that some of our disgruntled administrators have made an appeal directly to the German Cabinet, trying to go over von Göring's head to have him removed. Fortunately, our friends in Berlin have ensured the cabinet will take no action, for now."
mittel.52.a:0 "Traitors in our midst, but friends in Berlin."

mittel.53.t:0 "The Muckrackers"
mittel.53.d:0 "While our friends in the government dismissed the accusations presented to it, it was leaked to the press. The honour of the Statthalter has been impinged, and this has given strength to the numerous journalists scuttling about Africa hoping to be the 'next E.D. Morel'."

mittel.54.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.54.d:0 "With von Göring gone, we must select a new Statthalter. While he is disgraced, there is still hope for a New Colonial Regime to bring order to the colony. Or, perhaps the old ways, advocated by the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft are best. Or lastly, reform may be the only way to prevent exactly this kind of behaviour."

mittel.56.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.56.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Major General Ernst Jünger as our new Statthalter. Awarded the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg, Jünger is something of a renaissance man. He is both an accomplished author, with his best seller "Storm of Steel" and an educated entomologist, using his time in Africa to discover and document numerous species, while introducing our Askari to 'stormtrooper tactics'. Jünger broke with the German Army after a dispute carried through a series of articles published in military journals in the mid-20s.\n\nUnable to convince the General Staff to adopt his views, he took a transfer to Africa, where he was more free to implement his theories on the importance of psychology in modern warfare. A member of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Ernst Jünger will bring what he calls a "new spirit of adventure" to the colonisation of Africa, as well as help us reform our infantry tactics."
mittel.56.a:0 "All hail the New Statthalter!"

mittel.57.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.57.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Franz Ritter von Epp as our Statthalter. A former General and current politician, Ritter von Epp fought in the Herero uprising and the ensuing repression, and earned the Pour le Mérite for his service in the Weltkrieg. After the war, Chancellor Ludendorf appointed him as the first postwar governor of Kamerun. Returning to Germany after serving as governor for three years, Ritter von Epp turned to politics, funding the creation of several patriotic newspapers, and serving in the Bavarian chamber of Imperial Counsellors. Ritter von Epp has never tried to hide his close ties to the Ludendorf dictatorship, and remains an outspoken apologist for Ludendorf. He is a controversial, almost belligerent figure, but the Kaiser has decided a fighting man is what Africa needs. A supporter of the Neue Kolonialregierung, Franz Ritter brings years of military experience and service to his post. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."
mittel.57.a:0 "Welcome to Afrika, von Epp."

mittel.58.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.58.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Fritz Thyssen as our Statthalter. The owner of the United Steel Works, Thyssen is a towering figure in the world of German Commerce, having served as the head of the German Iron and Steel Industry Association and as a board member of the Reichsbank. He's also been active in politics, providing financial support to right-wing parties and newspapers. He breaks from the right however in his outspoken support for higher wages and benefits for workers. He believes, like Bismarck before him, that the threat of Socialism can be averted by assuring a decent standard of living for it's workers. Thyssen claims it has the added benefit that well paid workers can purchase more German-made products, stimulating the economy. Some are calling this model of paying workers high enough wages to purchase industrial output and ensure loyalty 'Thyssenism.' Frtitz Thyssen has long been associated with the Neue Kolonialregierung, with rumours circulating that he helped fund Hermann von Göring's rise in politics, or that he was involved in the financial slush fund alleged in the 'Black Dossier'. None of these allegations have been proven yet, and the Kaiser has appointed Thyssen to the position of Statthalter, with a special eye to increase mining output in the Congo. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."

mittel.59.e:0 "Erwin Rommel, a Fine Armoured Commander."

mittel.60.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.60.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Commodore Ludwig Bockholt as our new Statthalter. Bockholt is best known for his daring resupply of General von Lettow-Vorbeck during the Weltkrieg. The young commander Bockholt flew the Airship L 59 "Die Afrika-schiff" from Jamboli Airstation in Bulgaria to the Mahange plateau in Tanjanika, after a grueling 100 hour flight across the deserts of Egypt and Sudan. The voyage resupplied our armies in Afrika with new weapons, ammunition, and most critically, quinine, that helped keep our armies in good fighting order until the Peace with Honour. It was the only resupply of East Afrika during the war, and holds other distinctions such as the longest military flight record, and flying the first aerial resupply mission. Because the mission was a one-way trip, Buckholt served the rest of the war as a naval infantry officer in the East Afrikan Theatre. After the war, Commodore Bockholt continued to refine his aerial resupply tactics and equipment, creating air mobile and later paratrooper naval infantry units. Despite such an innovative spirit, he is one of the leading officers of the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and proved to be a thorn in the side of Statthalter von Göring, clashing with him frequently on the direction, and command of Mittelafrika's Air Force. With Bockholt as our Statthalter, we can expect Mittelafrika to maintain world class aerial infantry. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."
mittel.60.a:0 "All hail the New Statthalter!"

mittel.61.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.61.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Generaloberst Georg Kraut as our new Statthalter. During the Weltkrieg, Kraut was one of the most senior officers in East Afrika, after Generals von Lettow-Vorbeck and Wahle. He took command of the battles of Killamanjaro, Saliata Hill and Latema Nek, leading the troops to victory each time. After the war, he took divisional command, and put down rebellions in the Upper Kongo and Ruvuma Valley. In 1925, he would be the one to negotiate the entry of German troops into British East Africa, and conduct the occupation. Later, he would become commander of all armed forces in Mittelafrika. To the extent that the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft has a leader, it's him. With Generaloberst Georg Kraut in command, we can expect to continue the finest German military traditions. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration."

mittel.62.t:0 "A New Statthalter"
mittel.62.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Dr. Rudolf Asmis as our new Statthalter. Dr. Asmis is a jurist with a long career in the Reichskolonialamt. He has served as a district officer in Togoland, Consul to the Belgian Congo, Counsellor to the General Government of Belgium, delegate to the Shanghai Convention, and most recently, head of the Reichkolonialamt. His most notable, and controversial work has been with his policy of 'Bezirksleiterrecht,' a policy of legitimizing and formalizing local and tribal law, and giving district officers the power to defer to this law in place of German Law. This has had been tried in Samoa with some success in reducing conflict with the locals. With such a long history in Imperial and Foreign affairs, he naturally has a close relationship with the Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft, and will favour their ideas in decision making. A gifted diplomat with global experience as the head of the Reichskolonialamt, Dr. Asmis is eager to see Afrika fulfil a key role in Germany's Weltpolitik.

We will set up a more democratic administration in Mittelafrika, but who shall oversee the transition?"

mittel.64.d:0 "The Kaiser has appointed Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck as our new , with Theodor von Hassel as his Vice-Statthalter. The leader of the Reformgruppe and son of General Friedrich von Hassel. Theodor von Hassel came to Afrika as a Oberleutnant in the Schutztruppe, and served in the Maji Maji rebellion. In the Siege of the Mahenge, his group of sixty soldiers held off several thousand rebel attackers, winning him the Order of the Red Eagle. After the Maji Maji war, von Hassel left the Schutztruppe to found a coffee farm, but volunteered for service during the Weltkrieg. After the war, he returned to his coffee plantation, which has grown into one of the most successful in Tanjanika. Dissatisfied with the way settlers like him were treated, and helped into politics by his father in law, the politician Jacob Jebsen, Theodor von Hassel spent years agitating on behalf of settlers' rights to democratic representation, as well as economic and political rights.The Kaiser has seen this man represents the will of the white and educated native population of Africa, and has deemed him worthy of being Statthalter. In a radio address the new Statthalter has formally denounced Goering and the Souverainisten, claiming them to be responsible for the reprehensible actions taken by members of our administration. To oversee the democratic transition of Mittelafrika the Kaiser has sent our national hero Paul von Lettow Vorbeck back to the African continent, which has led to celebrations across the colony."

mittel.66.t:0 "Granting Autonomy to the Kingdoms"
mittel.66.d:0 "The first step to ensuring the stability of our new Africa, is granting more autonomy to the most powerful African kings under our influence. By granting autonomy to these troublesome regions, we will be essentialy eliminating all chances for rebellion against our rule and eliminating the option of our administration to collapse."

mittel.67.t:0 "Restoring Self-Rule to the British"
mittel.67.d:0 "When we seized the British holdings in Africa during the British Revolution, we did it under the legal pretence of restoring responsible government to these areas. Now, over a decade later, we can finally fulfil our promise and grant the white British settlers in these areas self-rule. This will have the benefit of dealing with the Royal Veterans Association, who has been a troublesome political force in our administration for a long time, and will make our administration ever more stable."

mittel.68.t:0 "Retaliation for the Black Dossier"
mittel.68.d:0 "Our administration has maintained its now sovereign rule only by the skin of its teeth. The corruption inquiry could have seen von Göring and many of our senior officials spend the rest of their lives in jail. We now have the opportunity to return the favour. While an official retaliation would be difficult, we can use our growing criminal network, the 'Lion Society', to seek retaliation against these conspirators, and reinforce our rule of Mittelafrika."

mittel.68.b:0 "Turn the other cheek."

mittel.69.t:0 "Our First Target"
mittel.69.d:0 "Our first suspect for the Black Dossier is Georg Kraut, one of Von Lettow-Vorbeck's most trusted officers during the Weltkrieg. He is well respected for this reason and likely gave his blessing to the project. He is already quite old, and perhaps it will be easier and less suspicious to induce his retirement than to kill him. We can produce a 'black dossier' of our own, and blackmail him into retirement. The allegations may not be true, but the old man won't want to fight them at this point."
mittel.69.a:0 "He should have retired years ago..."

mittel.70.t:0 "The Hunting Accident"
mittel.70.d:0 "Our next target in retaliation for the Black Dossier investigation is Ludwig Bockholt, who frequently has butted heads with von Göring over the priorities of the air force, as well as more personal matters. Since settling in Africa, Bockholt has become an avid big game hunter. One of our men was in his latest hunting expedition, and arranged for a 'hunting accident'. He swears that he thought Bockholt was a gazelle when he shot him, and the courts shall rule in his favour."
mittel.70.a:0 "Another one bites the dust."

mittel.71.t:0 "The Death of Rudolf Asmis"
mittel.71.d:0 "The next target of our retaliation for the Black Dossier is Rudolf Asmis, a diplomat with the Foreign Office, was the one who ensured the Foreign Minister saw the accusing evidence and presented it to the cabinet. He is out of our reach often, but travels a great deal between Berlin and Daressalam. A bit of sabotage has ensured that his aircraft crashed en route to his latest diplomatic assignment."
mittel.71.a:0 "Another one down, we are almost there..."

mittel.72.t:0 "The Final Target"
mittel.72.d:0 "We have long known that the officer clique behind the 'black dossier' must have been someone in the highest reaches of our administration. The source of the leak is even more embarrassing than expected. Von Göring's own brother, Albert, is the source. He has been staying in Africa under the fake name 'Albert von Epstein' a name based off of the Göring family's Jewish doctor and godfather. Rather than an ambitious conspirator, it seems he was motivated by a genuine crisis of conscience."

mittel.73.b:0 "We can refuse, actually!"

mittel.74.t:0 "A Triumph of Espionage"
mittel.74.d:0 "A programme created by General Doihara Kenji to distribute narcotics to our enemies has seen its greatest success yet. It appears that the German colony of Mittelafrika is rife with corruption, and its administrator has proven willing to smuggle cheap opium into Germany for us. Every morning the German newspapers are filled with the scandals of misspent youth, and the widespread drug usage is certain to weaken their army and war industry."
mittel.74.a:0 "Huzzah!"

mittel.75.t:0 "An Opium Epidemic"
mittel.75.d:0 "Recently, the use of opium by the general populace, and even our own troops has skyrocketed.

mittel.77.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in Berlin"
mittel.77.d:0 "The Huns in Africa have copied our ethnological exhibition! While it may be much larger in scale than ours, it lacks any of the elevating or moral character. In fact, the whole show ranges from the crudest of racism, to outright pornography with topless dancers performing fanciful, invented 'courtship dances.' Despite these numerous flaws, over 1 million people attended over the week."

mittel.78.d:0 "The Germans in Africa have produced an extraordinary ethnological exposition, showcasing the primitive customs of over 1,000 performers from over 100 different tribes in a zoo-like exhibition alongside elephants, lions and zebras. Tens of thousands attended the exhibit, which was found to be both educational and titillating. A testament to the effectiveness of German rule."

mittel.80.d:0 "The German colony of Mittelafrika has produced an ethnological exhibition of unparalleled size and scope, featuring over 1,000 authentic African tribesman on display, alongside numerous exotic animals. While the city's white population was pleased with the educational effects on the value of racial science, the general population, many of whom have never seen a negro before, were simply caught up in the spectacle.

mittel.84.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in London"
mittel.84.d:0 "The German colony of Mittelafrika's acclaimed ethnological exhibition has come to London. For years, such a showing would have been impossible under the rigid dogma of socialism, but now, once again, the British public can enjoy the benefits of science and the civilising mission. While no one can doubt the show was splendid, it did raise some of concern about the current state of the Empire, or the lack thereof."

mittel.85.t:0 "Die Neue Völkerschau Arrives in London"
mittel.85.d:0 "Our famed Völkerschau arrived in London, but rather then the usual appreciation for our civilising mission, our show seemed to inflame British nostalgia for their empire and own civilising mission.

mittel.89.d:0 "Workers in our new factories are discontent, complaining about long hours, poor safety standards, stolen wages and violence against workers who speak out. It is becoming a problem in the urban centres, and some fear it may lead to the spread of syndicalism. Fortunately for now, the workers remain disorganised."

mittel.92.t:0 "First African Divisions Arrive"
mittel.92.d:0 "Under the reforms of our New Colonial Regime in Africa, African recruits will not simply be placed in colonial policing roles, but provide new divisions for our army in Europe. The extra manpower is welcome, given the tense situation in Europe."

The Island of Zanzibar control access to our capital city of Daressalam, and to the Mozambique Channel. Despite its strategic location, the islands are underdeveloped compared to their counterparts in Europe and Asia. In response to the report, the Admiralty has funded naval fortifications in Sanzibar, and improvements to the harbour to serve as a primary base for the Kriegsmarine in the event of a war in the Indian Ocean."

mittel.98.d:0 "During a royal tour of Germany, the young Chief Adam Sapi of the Wahehe people lodged an awkward request. During our subjugation of East Africa, their tribal leader Chief Mkwavinyika Munyigumba Mwamuyinga, conducted a campaign of military resistance against our rule for 8 long years. After his death, his head was cut off and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. As part of his tour, Chief Sapi requested to visit the museum and see the skull. He asks that it be returned with him to Tanganjika. The Wahehe have superstitions about the disposal of remains, and wish to give his skull an honourable burial."

Mkwawa was a fierce rebel during the early part of our rule of Africa. It took years to surround him, at which point he committed suicide to avoid capture. His skull was removed, and sent by Commander Tom von Prince to the Bremen Anthropological Museum. It has now been returned, as a sign of good will, to ensure the friendliness and cooperation of the Wahehe people."

mittel.100.d:0 "We've encountered a bit of a diplomatic faux pas. During one of his sponsored royal tours, Chief Adam Sepi of the Wahehe requested the return of his predecessor's skull, currently kept in the Bremen Anthropological Museum. The skull belongs to Chief Mkwawa, who was a rebel against German rule and beheaded by Commander Tom von Prince, who sent the skull to the Museum's collection. The Wahehe are very respectful of their ancestors, and believe that with the skull in such a disrespectful state, it is certain to anger the spirits. Unfortunately, the German government has refused the return of the skull as a matter of principle, creating discontent even beyond the Wahehe tribe."

mittel.102.d:0 "The vanishing funds, the atrocities commited by our adminstrators, the thousands of mercenaries funneled into Ostafrika; we should have seen this coming, yet we did not. Hermann von Goering has declared his castle in Tanga the new seat of power of “his” Mittelafrikan Reich and has declared war on us. He has clearly premeditated this act of rebellion for months, as the entire Hauptstadtterritorium is now overwhelmed by his mercenary forces and Askari loyalists. Many members of the NKR have also deserted to join his cause, leaving the DKG practically alone to combat this crisis. Such a blatant attack on our legitimacy is doing massive damage to our already precarious grip on the rest of our territories, not to mention those of our protectorates. Stirrings of rebellion are everywhere. This may well be the end of Mittelafrika as we have come to know it..."

Across the colony, seperatist movements and rebellious states rise up from within, tearing the massive, continent-spanning colony apart from the inside. With former colonial head Hermann Göring having been recalled to the Kaiserreich for higher duties, the colony has been hit with wave after wave of instability and ineptitude, and now it has become all too much for the fragile patchwork of colonies and local chiefdoms to stand against.

The British lost nearly 4,000 men in the operation, to a loss of less than 200 German Askari.\n\nThe battle paved the way to our invasion and conquest of Mozambique in 1918. Since 1922, it has been a state holiday in Mittelafrika.

Bernhard served for only three years, from 1907 to 1910, but he had an enormous influence on the development of the colony of German East Afrika, that would eventually form the core of Mittelafrika. It was his reforms that firmly established the first fully secular education system on the Afrikan continent, a legacy we have tried, with difficulty, to spread throughout Mittelafrika.

mittel.125.t:0 "The Kenyan Church"
mittel.125.d:0 "When we moved into British Territory in 1925, the British hold on the territory was dangerously weak after 7 years of warfare. In the same year British strikes coincided with a series of protests by the natives in British East Africa; the Church of Scotland Mission declared the practice of female circumcision banned for Christians, labelling it 'sexual mutilation of women'. For the dominant ethnic group of the region, the Kikuyu, the practice, which they call irua, is the 'conditio sine qua non' of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion. They felt so strongly about this that it has caused a rupture within the Christian community in Kikuyuland. The Anglican Church quickly followed the Scottish Church in banning the practice, but in response, the Kikuyu have created their own 'African Churches'. They've established their own theological schools, which have become a hotbed of Kikuyu nationalism. At the same time, with the fall of Britain to socialism, there is a schism within the Anglican and Scottish churches themselves. In Canterbury Cathedral, the Union of Britain has declared Archbishop John Hobbis Harris as the head of worldwide Anglican communion, while in Ottawa the British Monarch has declared, under his authority as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, Archbishop Cosmo Gordon Lang to be the head of the communion. The Scottish Kirk has seen a similar schism. It is impossible to tell for certain who any given Anglican minister believes is the real head of the church, and they might be listening to Archbishop Harris, who is a campaigner against imperialism in Africa."

mittel.127.t:0 "The Kenyan Highlands Settlement Policy"
mittel.127.d:0 "The Highlands of Kenya are one of the few areas of Africa suitable to white settlement. The rare combination of cool uplands combined with healthy soil creates a climate almost like that of Europe, and excellent for farming. It is no wonder that the land there is in high demand.\n\nUnfortunately, it's long been economically underused. The British settlers have proven more interested in establishing themselves as landholders and letting the native Kikuyu do the labour. If we opened the land up to small German farmers squeezed by the Junker estates, we could improve productivity and increase our influence on the region, but it would also make the land shortage even more intense."

mittel.128.t:0 "Land Crisis in the Kenyan Highlands"
mittel.128.d:0 "Allowing German settlement in the Highlands of Kenia has only exacerbated the problems in the region, as it has set off land speculation, with prices rising out of control, and conflicts and disputes breaking out over the demarcation of a few metres of land. To make matters worse, for the local Kikuyu tribes, a man is not considered an adult until he owns at least some land. There are tribal territories set aside for this, but they are massively overcrowded, with most of them owning no land and working on British plantations. Additionally, an increasing amount of land within the tribal areas is monopolised by the local chiefs. This land shortage is creating unrest on all sides."

Supposedly, they conduct 'magic rituals' under the cover of darkness, and swear oaths to kill white settlers. By killing Senior Chief Waruhiu, who had a body guard and was held in high esteem by our administration, they've demonstrated there's almost no one in the Kenian Highlands they couldn't kill, right now."

mittel.167.d:0 "Born after the absorption of the French colonies gained by treaty after the Weltkrieg, Mittelafrika is a massive swath of land. Composed of cities, chiefdoms, kingdoms, farmlands, jungles, savannahs, deserts and more; it covers half of the Dark Continent. A complex web of treaties, agreements and tacit understandings, the colony, while stable, is remarkably unprofitable; in no part due to the continued protection of the British colonies. Placed under our suzerainity following the 1925 British revolution, Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria and Zambia’s administration is funded by Mittelafrikan profits. Our Statthalter Wilhelm Solf and Heinrich Schnee of Ostafrika have thus far managed to keep our bureaucracy on good terms with our French, British and Belgian patrons, but trouble is brewing. The old guard is challenged by a new clique who seeks to centralise Mittelafrika further under German rule and within them is a sinister cabal of extremists led by Hermann von Göring, who want to exploit our good patrons for their personal gain. Solf is getting old, time is fleeting, and von Göring promises untold riches to his adherents no matter the cost. But could that cost be too great for Mittelafrika to pay?

The speech ended with an official proclamation: All treaties, titles, and priviliges held by the African kingdoms and their subjects are now "unconditionally forfeit", with all former holders of titles expected to swear an oath of loyalty within the week. This marks a sharp turn in Mittelafrikan colonial policy, and is sure to have serious implications. We've stopped receiving communications from most of the continent, presumably as they protest..."

The man would not even get an audience were he not a war hero, but the Kaiser's advisors see something about his demeanor that suggests he is deathly serious. Vorbeck has refused to leave without the necessary troops and ammunition needed to put down the various native revolts that are in their infancy for now but will only grow with time.

The Kaiser, remembering the Weltkrieg and the heroic deeds of Lettow-Vorbeck in Afrika with fondness, is inclined to give the man what he needs, but his advisors insist that we need the resources here at home. We are already on the brink of a new war with the Syndicalists and the Russians, but if we can just keep our colonies together for long enough, perhaps we will be strong enough to repeat the impossible.

The chief figures within the NKR, namely Heydrich and von Epp, have realized that Göring is nothing but a madman hellbent on total domination within Mittelafrika as solace for his removal from the German political scene. Seeking to ride the wave of popularity generated by his Young Officer Clique, Göring planned to take the position of Staathalter and rapidly push towards total sovereignty from the Kaiserreich, full parity with the Kaiser’s position, and seeks to expand his colonial fiefdom until in consumes all of Africa. These insane dreams could only have been invented within the mind of a madman, and the NKR has begun to fully understand just how dangerous Göring truly is. \n\nThis information getting out however would definitely hurt the NKR’s chances of winning the Staathalter’s position given that the likely reaction to Göring’s schemes coming out would be a resurgence to the RFG’s recently rising power as a harsh and opposite reaction to Göring’s tyranny. With this in mind, the NKR has decided to keep quiet on this kernel of truth until all the necessary evidence is compiled and ready to present, for they will only get one shot at taking down Göring and his schemes."

For centuries, he and his fellow native Afrikans had been forced to sit on the sidelines while the Europeans decided the world order and declared his people's destinies with a flick of the pen, or the barrel of a gun. This perverse and one sided dynamic has finally been toppled, and with Kenyatta’s election, the Pan-African dream has been fulfilled without firing a shot or spilling a drop of native blood.

mittelfla.4.d:0 "A joyous day to all the peoples of the colony has arrived as the varied denizens of Mittleafrika celebrate the most holy of holidays.\n\nFamily and farmers, soldiers and bureaucrats alike all spent the day commiserating with one another while feasting, singing, dancing, and drinking in an atmosphere of pure love and peace for all strata of society.\n\nFor a brief moment, the population felt at peace and one with itself as a whole, and in a moment rarely seen in the colonies, the colonials and natives were seen side by side in the festivities. Held in their glee were the hopes and dreams of colonial coexistence for a future seen in but a glimpse and, however briefly, was one witnessed with a range of emotions. Many of the veteran soldiers were reminded of the Christmas Truce of 1915, seeing in their mind's eye a moment in time free from the divisions in their society, where one might live and prosper as one.\n\n Whatever the future may bring, today we shall rejoice!

A better alternative, they argue, is to force the Congolese to buy their independence, making them pay a large sum of money to maintain their autonomy.

One of the ways they hope to deal with our glaring manpower issue is to finalize our policy on the use of mercenaries. The main three attitudes that have appeared on this issue have been predictable. There are the staunch professonalist war hawks of the old guard that want nothing to do with the unruly and brutish mercs. Then there are the moderates who feel that limited applications of mercenaries, particularly as special forces where the harsh training would hone their rough edges. Finally, the radicals seek to hire as many mercenaries as possible to help solve our glut of skilled soldiers, regardless of the penalties.

Among the new ideas that require debate is the party’s official stance on the use of mercenaries. In the fierce debate, three main camps have formed on what to do. There are the old guard war hawks that want little to do with the savage and undisciplined bushmen, who fear any mercenary influence would infect the rest of our armed forces. Then there are the moderates who feel that limited applications of mercenaries, particularly as support groups where their unprofessionalism wouldn’t wreak such havoc.

This however gained him many enemies within the High Command, who wanted to keep Germany practicing more traditional forms of warfare. After he published a renowned book on warfare, the Kaiser sent him to Africa to keep him out of the way of the High Command. However, this only strengthened his position in the high command as his doctrine of armoured warfare was perfectly suited the vast African plains. And now, with the Statthalter gone Rommel has been primed to take charge over Mittelafrika, and with him in Charge Mittelafrika’s warfare will be brought into the modern age. "

Throughout the Kaiser's vast African possessions, various armed groups are struggling for power. Among them are native armed cliques composed of our former soldiers and  several socialist and republican militia fighting against the locals colonials administrations which is desperately trying to maintain order, seasoned mercenaries rebelling against their former employers, UMK businessmen fearing for their possessions, ghosts of the past rising in Kenya, the ever-determined Goering regrouping his followers near our capital, the Old Guard at its wits' end grouping in Sudwestafrika, panicked Schutztruppe garrisons abandoning their positions, native chiefs with dubious loyalty seemingly turning against us.\n\nThe disastrous situation has reached a point of no return and only a miracle can save us."

The second choice would be to favor the conservative tribal chiefs of Northern Westafrika, unofficially led by Jonathan Savi of Tové, they have a great influence on the political level and on the native people of Westafrika, and are greatly attached to the African tradition of the different native people, although not as rich as the Olympios, their support would also be of great help and would greatly improve our relations with the natives.\n\nWhat will be our final choice?"

The second is the Frenchman Jules Bréviè, the most social and populist of the three administrators, he promotes the establishment of social programs and welfare for settlers and natives and the extension of the rights of the natives in order to avoid their opposition and to contain possible future revolts, supporting him will surely greatly improve our relations with the natives The last one is the English Arnold Hodsons who is in favor of moderation and status-quo, he is a good middle ground choice between the three men and will surely ensure the stability of the colony.

The second would be to block all Jewish immigration from outside Mittelafrika, to apply a forced cultural integration process for any Jew wishing to remain in Mittelafrika and to arrest any Jewish leaders expressing separatist views.\n\nWhat plans should we implement?"

We must find a way to resolve their separatist tendencies if we want our centralization process to be effective in the region, we can use two main approaches.\n\nThe first would be to extend the autonomy and privileges of the various local Malagasy chiefs in order to ensure their loyalty to Dar es Salaam and to reduce separatist tendencies among the natives. The second approach would be to launch large-scale reprisal programs against all republican, socialist, monarchist, and separatist native groups and to launch propaganda campaigns reminding the natives of the danger of ideologies such as syndicalism.\n\nWhat orders should we give to the administration of Madagascar?

However, Mutasa as King of Uganda has more influence and power than any local chief, ruling over several chiefs who are vassals to him, giving him considerable influence, which gets in the way of our centralization process.\n\nWe have two main choices, the first would be to negotiate with Mutasa to help our local administration and centralization process in exchange for an increase in autonomy, a guarantee that we will not touch his privileges and titles, and that we will let him control his army. The second, more radical approach would be to revoke his privileges once and for all and bring the region under direct colonial control, which will undoubtedly anger the tribal leaders but will greatly assist our centralization process.\n\nBoth choices are considered viable by our administration, so the final choice remains."

Since our arrival in this jungle, we have slowly worked to replace as many Flandro-Wallonian colonials as possible with loyal German officers, but this has caused great tension with our supposed allies.

With small fortunes, their own businesses, higher education, and deep political ties, the Évolués are a sort of bridge between colonial and native. Now we must decide if it is time to repair and utilize this bridge, or shall we burn it down so as to remove any ideas of social and economic mobility from the minds of the native Congolese. They hold great influence and sway over their fellow Congolese, and we must keep this in mind as we make our decision."

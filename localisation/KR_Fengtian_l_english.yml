#Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Fengtian, known as the 'Three Eastern Provinces' during the Qing and Beiyang periods, were split into nine smaller sub-divisions in 1931 to aid governance and economic planning. The vast majority of Fengtian's industry and mineral wealth is concentrated in the South, while the central and Northern provinces are primarily agricultural. Jehol, to the Southwest of Liaoning Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Beijing and the Northeast. Thanks to the government's new initiatives incentivising development across the provinces, prosperity will surely increase, but serious structural issues remain, and may become problematic as a result of increasing disparity in development between the north and south.

#The 'Huanghanhui', or 'Imperial Han Society', have been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects.\n\nShortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Shenyang, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."

#"The Imperial Han Society, a secret society with a Han-chauvinistic ideology and uncompromising hate of other ethnicities, is believed to be behind a number of killings in Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. The targets appear to be more or less random, linked only by their status as ethnic Russians, Manchu, Koreans, and Japanese. Mantetsu and the Japanese Consulate are demanding investigations, and the Kempeitai have already carted away a number of suspects to an unknown fate."

POLITICS_ZHANG_ZUOLIN_DESC: "Born to an impoverished family near Shenyang, Zhang Zuolin began his meteoric rise as a bandit exploiting the chaotic military situation of the late Guangxu Era. After securing governorship of Manchuria, Zhang went on to fight a series of wars with the Anhui and Zhili Cliques, at times extending his influence as far south as Shanghai. Despite Zhang's best efforts an economically unstable home front, German intervention, and Wu Peifu's military genius have seen him again contained to the provinces north of the Great Wall. He has been stoking old ambitions ever since, converting his formerly regionalist administration into a bastion of republicanism, claiming direct lineage from the Xinhai Revolution. His actual commitment to democratic principles remains to be seen.\nDespite his poor literacy and lack of a formal education, the 'Old Marshal' is a capable and self-aware leader, happy to seek advice and delegate where necessary to cover his deficiencies. However, he is also known for a short temper and an unforgiving nature, readily holding deep grudges. Zhang is also sometimes greatly self-centered, formerly crashing the entire Northeastern economy to support his war efforts. And so, in ideological terms, he could be described as staunchly 'Pro-Zhang'."

Favouring rebuilding China from the ground-up, this group emphasises the value of the traditional Chinese village as the basic building block of society, rather than the warlords cliques that have dominated China for the last half-century. The second part of the coalition is a loose group of intellectuals inspired to the works of Kang Youwei, an ambitious reformer of the late Qing dynasty who advocated for a constitutional monarchy. Following the conquest of the Qing, many of the followers of the NCERA in Zhili lands have defected to Zhang's government and reforming the Party.

While formed as a big tent party with broad beliefs within it's membership, the party can be said to generally advocate for a system of moderate social democracy guided by Sut Yat Sen's three principles. There also exists a strong current of localism and ruralism as well as support for the Empire, inherited from taking in NCERA intellectuals and bolstered by the general enthusiasm inspired by Zhang Zuolin's rule.

Despite this, the CNSP has continued their support of the newborn Empire, with a appreciably leftist interpretation of Sun Yat Sen's Three Principles of the People being a key part of the party’s platform; a fact which has caused many to cast suspicions on the CNSP as being a veiled wing of the Kuomintang in spite of their proclamations of loyalty to the Government.§!"

FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order_desc: "Ironically, Fengtian is the sole national government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although its republican commitments are questionable, and Southern reclamation is currently unrealistic, the government has loudly advocated both goals, as they foster domestic legitimacy."

FNG_Silence_Targeted_Subversives: "Silence Targeted Subversives"
FNG_Silence_Targeted_Subversives_desc: "The regionalist movement has never been organized, but it has received support from the local gentry, school teachers, and government bureaucrats. Some of these figures have become increasingly prominent, and by silencing them we may cut the head from the regionalist snake. Some can be bribed, and others can be threatened or fired - to say nothing of other persusaive methods."
FNG_Justify_Mass_Arrests: "Justify Mass Arrests"
FNG_Justify_Mass_Arrests_desc: "So long as the regionalist movement remains peaceful, we lack the institutional and public support to crush it decisively.

FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise: "Japanese Electrical Expertise"
FNG_Japanese_Electrical_Expertise_desc: "Thanks to China's backwardness over the past century, and the chaos of the past two decades, the country has few native engineers. Japanese assistance will be essential in bringing modernity to the Northeast."

FNG_Mantetsu_Research_Wing_desc: "Mantetsu's Research Wing, known as 'Mantetsu Chōsabu', serves as the centrepiece of Japan's colonial programme, and pursues a wide variety of scientific goals. Its massive funding and talent pool could be of great use to us in our own efforts."
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects: "Mantetsu Civil Engineering Projects"
FNG_Mantetsu_Civil_Engineering_Projects_desc: "While the Japanese have much to benefit directly from large civil engineering projects in Fengtian, they also do so indirectly by helping to present our regime as successful at improving the everyday lives of citizens. In this respect, our interests are mutually aligned."
#Crossover Section

Modern technologies could allow settlers to penetrate this hostile environment and pursue rumors of coal, gold, and graphite in the Khingan Mountains."
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals: "Fengtian Society for Light Metals"
FNG_Fengtian_Society_for_Light_Metals_desc: "Significant deposits of Bauxite and Alunite have been known to exist in Fengtian Province for many years, but recent advances by Mantetsu sponsored laboratories in Fushun and Tokyo have enabled Aluminium production via a number of electro-chemical processes."
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity: "Yalu and Songhua Hydroelectricity"
FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity_desc: "Manchuria's abundant coal deposits make for an excellent power source, but the strong currents of the Yalu and Songhua rivers could provide additional power at minimal expense. With Japanese expertise, we might harness these mighty rivers to power more homes and industry."
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods: "Japanese Coal Gasification Methods"
FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods_desc: "Japan's quest for crucial oil lead it to Manchuria, but now with disappointing results from prospecting, coal gasification seems the only logical path forward. Though energy intensive, Fushun's enormous coal deposits could make the complex processes worthwhile."
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities: "Manchurian Model Cities"
FNG_Manchurian_Model_Cities_desc: "Japan sometimes goes to surprising lengths to portray its role in Fengtian as one of benevolent paternalism, to which end Mantetsu plans to install state of the art electrical, sewer, and tram systems in the major cities of Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin."

FNG_Expand_the_Anshan_Mines_desc: "The enormous iron deposits in Anshan have been described as being of 'world class significance', and churn out nearly 7 million tonnes of iron, with the potential to triple output by 1942. This expansion seems likely to propel Anshan toward becoming one of East Asia's largest industrial centres."
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone: "Establish the Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
FNG_Establish_the_Jinzhou_Industrial_Zone_desc: "Jinzhou's docks and strategic position in the 'Liaoxi Corridor', which connects land transportation between North and Northeast China, make it a prime target for government incentivised development. It remains to be seen whether special rules will be applied to this zone favouring Chinese or Japanese companies."
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines: "Expand the Fushun Mines"
FNG_Expand_the_Fushun_Mines_desc: "The mines around Fushun churn out nearly 11 million tons of coal per year, with deposits promising to produce over 4.5 billion tonnes total. While some modern trains and ships in the West use oil, the Japanese Empire runs on coal, and the strategic significance of these mines cannot be understated."
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development: "Yingkou Commercial Development"
FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development_desc: "The port city of Yingkou serves as Fengtian's primary gateway to the world, and the second largest port on the Bohai Gulf after Japanese-controlled [GetDalianName]. The tremendous increase in material production in Fengtian demands an equally large investment in commercial infrastructure."
#Develop the Nine Provinces Section
FNG_Develop_the_Nine_Provinces: "Develop the Nine Provinces"
FNG_Develop_the_Nine_Provinces_desc: "The Nine Provinces of Manchuria, split from the original three, already contain over 30% of China's railroads and feature relatively widespread heavy industry, but if Fengtian is to move into the future these will have to be expanded upon and improved. Ideally this would be achieved solely by the Chinese people, but reality dictates that the Japanese will lead much of the path forward."
FNG_Wang_Yongjiangs_Legacy: "Wang Yongjiang's Legacy"
FNG_Wang_Yongjiangs_Legacy_desc: "Manchuria's transformation from a backward borderland into one of China's most prosperous regions owes itself to the work of Wang Yongjiang, Zhang Zuolin's late Finance Minister. Disgusted by the Grand Marshal's costly excursions south of the Great Wall in 1928, Wang resigned and died shortly thereafter, his work left unfinished. We must pick up where he left off."
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC: "Reorganise the NTC"
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC_desc: "Founded by the Fengtian Government shortly after its creation, the National Transportation Commission serves as a planning board for infrastructure construction across the country. The Japanese allege that its foremost aim is to disrupt Mantetsu's operations, and there may be at least some truth to this claim."
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies: "Support Sino-Japanese Joint Companies"
FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies_desc: "A great number of businesses in Fengtian offer shares to both Chinese and Japanese, including the infamous Mantetsu, but relatively few Chinese have the funds to invest and as a result most joint companies are Japanese dominated. Government backing may permit us to provide means and incentives to fellow Chinese and gradually shift this balance."
#Political Branch
FNG_From_Beijing_to_the_Begonia_Leaf: "From Beijing to the Begonia Leaf"
FNG_From_Beijing_to_the_Begonia_Leaf_desc: "For decades, students and nationalists have compared the shape of China, that is to say China undivided, to the shape of a Begonia leaf. With Beijing in our hands, it has come time to reclaim all of our homeland, and make the Begonia Leaf a reality!"
FNG_Unification_through_Negotiation: "Unification by Negotiation"
FNG_Unification_through_Negotiation_desc: "Since 1911, all attempts to truly unify China by way of negotiation have met with failure, as divides have proven insurmountable. However, after so many years of conflict and division, with Beijing now unquestionably in the Grand Marshal’s hands, it may be possible to bring at least some of China’s parties and factions to the negotiating table."
FNG_Restore_1923_Constitution: "Restore the 1923 Constitution"
FNG_Restore_1923_Constitution_desc: "The 1923 Constitution was widely recognized as China’s most modern, but the sheer corruption of Cao Kun’s Zhili Clique made its proclamation ring hollow, and its implementation impossible. Since 1928, when Fengtian was passed the torch of Republicanism, the Constitution has remained suspended due to strategic necessity. The time has come to restore the old constitution and resume elections."
FNG_The_China_Welfare_Fund: "The China Welfare Fund"
FNG_The_China_Welfare_Fund_desc: "Song Qingling, wife to the late Dr. Sun, is a figure around whom all Republicans can rally. In return for her political support, Mrs. Song has asked that [FNG.GetNameDef] make several guarantees in return. The first of these is the creation of the China Welfare Fund, which will funnel government aid toward women and children; often those at greatest risk of hunger and destitution."
FNG_Limited_Womens_Suffrage: "Limited Women's Suffrage"
FNG_Limited_Womens_Suffrage_desc: "Universal suffrage is a step too far, as gender roles are at the very foundation of any morally upright confucian society, but Song Qingling has demanded at least limited suffrage for women. With the right preparations made, women across the country will soon be able to vote in local elections, in spite of the move’s questionable popularity."
FNG_Toward_the_Third_Principle: "Toward the Third Principle"
FNG_Toward_the_Third_Principle_desc: "“Minsheng” or “People’s Welfare” is the last of Dr. Sun Yat-Sen’s three principles, but no less important than its fellows. Through various educational and developmental programs Song Qingling hopes to eventually realize this principle. The Fengtian Government will allocate a number of resources to this end."
FNG_anti_leftist_campaign: "Delegitimize KMT Republicanism"
FNG_anti_leftist_campaign_desc: "In the struggle for China, among the most powerful representitives of republicanism, the KMT are certainly the most revolutionary and difficult to reconcile with our own vision for China, but they regardless sapped potential support for our regime, but now with the success of the National Reunification conference, we finally posess the upper hand in the eyes of a critical mass of Chinese citizens, while the memory of our triumph in Beijing is fresh in their minds, let us strike out the vision of a revolutionarily leftist nation from the republican movement."
FNG_Integrate_Zhili_Defectors: "Welcome Zhili Defectors"
FNG_Integrate_Zhili_Defectors_desc: "When word of the Reunification conference reached the ears of many in the Zhili Sphere, they quickly realized where the winds would blow in the future and deserted the Zhili cause for our own, accepting the voices of these wayward bureaucrats and politicians into our ranks can be used to prove our legitimacy as a benevolent power, intent on unifying China more than scourging it."
FNG_Protect_Confucian_principles: "Protect Confucian Principles"
FNG_Protect_Confucian_principles_desc: "Despite the Xinhai's revolution uprooting the old and corrupt ways of the Dynasties, this does not mean we should forget what lies at the root of China itself, as even Dr Sun Yat Sen himself wished only to save China from decadent and weak Empires, to this end let us reinforce the age old morals and tenets of confucius in our state, so that our new ways may remember and keep to timeless principles."

FNG_Bring_in_Yan_Xishan_Thought_desc: "In his mountain holdout of Shanxi, Yan Xishan has long been devising a new philosophy, one to bring his fief to modernity, this "Yan Xishan" thought draws from a myriad of influences new and old, from Christianity to Confucianism and from Federalism to Syndicalism, this new strain of thinking has caught the attention of the Grand Marshal and could be applied to all corners of China to great benefit, but such radical measures cannot of course, be without controversy."
FNG_Revived_Rural_Reconstruction: "Revived Rural Reconstruction"
FNG_Revived_Rural_Reconstruction_desc: "The rural hinterland of China has been neglected for far too long. It is time to formulate a comprehensive plan to revive development in these areas in order to join them to the richer, coastal areas and bridge the urban-rural divide. Nationally organized public works programs, including the construction of additional canals and railways, should give a boost to this development."
FNG_Redefine_Provincial_Obligations: "Redefine Provincial Obligations"
FNG_Redefine_Provincial_Obligations_desc: "One of the promises made to Chen Jiongming by Zhang Zuolin was assurances that the new government would adopt federalist characteristics. The provinces will be allowed to levy their own independent taxes, though they must be subject to Central Government oversight. It's not a satisfying compromise to both sides, but so are compromises."
FNG_Supress_the_Bandits_Collect_the_Harvest: "Suppress the Bandits; Collect the Harvest"
FNG_Supress_the_Bandits_Collect_the_Harvest_desc: "The last time soldiers of the Fengtian Army entered the North China Plain, some units were encouraged to suppress banditry and assist in collection the seasonal harvest in return for lodgings and food. Where such amenities were normally simply seized, these tactics seem to have ameliorated local unrest and partisan activity. All commanders would do well to follow this example."

FNG_Continue_the_Reclamation_War_desc: "The war of National Reclamation did not end with the capture of Beijing. One by one, each of China’s provinces must be brought to heel, and the country once again unified."
FNG_Integrate_Occupied_Arsenals: "Integrate Occupied Arsenals"
FNG_Integrate_Occupied_Arsenals_desc: "The Shenyang Arsenal is unquestionably the greatest in China, but by integrating and specializing newly seized arsenals, now as part of a national supply system, we may be able to ease the burden on Shenyang and improve our overall logistical capability."

FNG_Crush_Flies_and_Capture_Pigs_desc: "Corruption and abuse of power have run rampant throughout China over the past several decades, and all levels of the Fengtian Government are complicit in this activity. In order to regain the public’s trust, some measure of law and order must be restored, and examples will be made of both low-level “Flies” and high-level “Pigs”, who have been greedily gorging themselves on the nation’s livelihood."
FNG_Expand_the_Baojia_System: "Expand the Baojia System"
FNG_Expand_the_Baojia_System_desc: "The Baojia System is an ancient method of social organization and military recruitment. Zhang Zuolin revived the practice several decades ago in the Northeast, and to great effect, but now the time has come to once again expand the system to the rest of China, where it has by and large fallen by the wayside."
FNG_Incorporate_Local_Patronage_Networks: "Incorporate Local Patronage Networks"
FNG_Incorporate_Local_Patronage_Networks_desc: "There is more to every institution than meets the eye, and every good warlord builds his stronghold through a network of reciprocal partnerships negotiated behind closed doors. With the collapse of enemy authority, there are many such individuals and institutions without a clear place in the new order. There is every reason to begin incorporating these individuals into our own networks, where possible."
FNG_Broaden_the_Bingzhan_Network: "Broaden the Bingzhan Network"
FNG_Broaden_the_Bingzhan_Network_desc: "The Fengtian Army has long been renowned for its outstanding system of logistics, allowing its soldiers to receive regular rations and ammunition where others are forced to forage or steal from peasants. A key component in the system are “Bingzhan” or logistics depots, which must now be built in recently conquered areas."
FNG_Reclaim_the_Railways: "Reclaim the Railways"
FNG_Reclaim_the_Railways_desc: "Mostly built by Western hands, or at the very least funded by foreign capital, China’s railways have always been seen as a symbol of imperialism. Many are still owned in part by the same American or European corporations which built them, and the time has come to formally reclaim these railways and solidify the Central Government’s control over its own rail network, no matter the cost."
FNG_Centralize_Provincial_Revenues: "Centralize Provincial Revenues"
FNG_Centralize_Provincial_Revenues_desc: "Perhaps the greatest source of disunity in China has been the decentralisation of the tax system, begun with the introduction of provincial “Lijin” transit tariffs in 1853. The new Central Government must limit provincial taxation, and reduce the percentage local authorities may keep for themselves. Otherwise, local governments will continue to deny the nation revenue."
FNG_Institute_Labour_Discipline: "Institute Labour Discipline"
FNG_Institute_Labour_Discipline_desc: "The industrial policy of our nation is being threatened by the increasingly divergent interests of industrialists, union leaders and workers. Unions serve only to divide, and creating distrust, forcing the leaders of our country to compromise. Only through a intervention that solidifies the discipline and loyalty of labor organisations, can the unity be forged that will allow us to move our country forward."
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best: "The Generals Know Best"
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best_desc: "There is no doubt that a centralized army can serve as the foundation to a centralized state, but China's great size requires a different approach. For this reason, we will continue to appoint military governors. To better balance this arrangement, provincial armies must recruit the majority of troops from outside their own provinces, and limit their production and deployment of heavy weapons."
FNG_One_Army_One_Republic: "One Army One China"
FNG_One_Army_One_Republic_desc: "If we are to learn a single lesson from over two thousand years of Chinese history, it is that when military force is divided, so too is the country. In order to build a unified China we must create a single army, beneath a single banner, at the direction of a single command structure. This measure will not be popular at any level of government outside the Cabinet."
FNG_The_Ultimatum: "The Ultimatum"

FNG_Wipe_Japanese_Influence_desc: "Finally, with the matters of expelling the Japanese Bandits from our home settled, we can turn our attention from mending their superficial wound upon China toward the inward cancer of those elements in China whom sold themselves to the enemy, and now shall pay for their betrayal."

FNG_Assert_Dominance_desc: "With those who would subjugate us to Japan out of the picture, and Mantetsu knowing it, we can finally have the leverage we need to give them terms that will be truly beneficial, than the faustian bargain that Japan's greedy lackeys had grown so used to, even if this makes them not quite as eager to put their full back into such an agreement as before, it is a leap and bound ahead of the veiled exploitation of yesterday, instead being a truly mutually beneficial relationship."
FNG_Come_To_Terms: "Renew Bargaining with Mantetsu"
FNG_Come_To_Terms_desc: "While we have finally put those who were more endeared to Japan than the Nation in their place, it remains an obvious fact that Mantetsu's full aid offered us a tremendous advantage in materiel that even our most loyal officers would be reluctant to give up, and given our now equal playing field in negotiations, perhaps it would be best for us to convince Mantetsu to lend us their strength again if we permit them to continue some degree of their former activities, much as it would frustrate the most hawkish members of the nation."
FNG_continue_the_relationship: "Our Continued Relations"
FNG_continue_the_relationship_desc: "With all of our recent moves designed to reshape the relationship with Japan to both more fair and beneficial one for our side, we are left with one unanswered question at the end of this road. How shall the future of our relationship with the Rising Sun look like? Shall Fengtian enter a more equal partnership within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, or has history shown that the only choice for the Sino-Japanese cooperation is to ensure it exists at an arm's length."

FNG_Unification_through_Subjugation_desc: "Negotiations have failed, as they always do, and now there is no choice but to unify China by the sword. Our few friends and allies will now rally behind us as we carry forth the Five Color flag, raising aloft a symbol that unites the hopes and dreams of all Chinese. It was force which broke China, then force which humiliated it, and now force shall make it whole again. The time has come to reclaim our country once and for all!"

FNG_Secure_the_Rear_Area_desc: "The North China Plain has been seized, but it has not been pacified. For now, the Army controls only the railways and their immediate proximity, with bandits and partisans running wild beyond. China is a big country, and the rear areas must be thoroughly scoured in order to ensure an uncompromised advance toward the goal of national reunification."
FNG_The_Question_of_the_Presidency: "The Question of the Presidency"
FNG_The_Question_of_the_Presidency_desc: "In Beijing, they say that when Zuolin stamps his foot the whole city shakes. Yet he is a soldier before a politician, and once no more than a bandit, making many question his suitability for the nation’s highest political office. With gossip already circulating about his advanced age, illiteracy, and vulgarity, his western-tutored son Zhang Xueliang may make a better choice, while Zuolin leads from the shadows."
FNG_Eliminate_Internal_Dissent: "Eliminate Internal Dissent"
FNG_Eliminate_Internal_Dissent_desc: "For many years the Fengtian Government has tolerated some measure of political plurality, with a variety of interest groups lobbying the government in return for promises and favors. Within Beijing in hand this system must come to an end. Subversive internal elements will be eliminated, and those that remain must toe the government line. There is no other way to govern a Chinese society."
FNG_Minde_Zhuyi: "Minde Zhuyi"
FNG_Minde_Zhuyi_desc: "Sun Yat-sen was right to call for the three principles. Yet, without morality, how could the people truly devote themselves to the nation? There must be a fourth principle, “People’s Morality”, based on Confucian principles in order to drag China away from the clutches of crime, and vice. Chief among these principles, of course, is appropriate deference to figures of paternal authority."

FNG_A_Father_to_the_People_desc: "While he may not be suited to the Presidency, the people must be taught to recognize the key role of Zhang Zuolin in our great strides towards unification, and toward an end to a century of national humiliation. In his rise from rags to leader, he has carried with him the aspirations of the people. Ten thousand years to Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin! Ten thousand years to the Republic of China!"

FNG_Chunchi-Xiangyi_desc: "It was once said that China and Japan are “as close as lips and teeth”, and today further integration can only mean further prosperity. Now we can ensure that China reaps all the benefits of Japanese manufacturing. Some call this the gateway to a captive Chinese market, but we have no need for fear-mongering. What the people want is cheap clothing, radios, and cigarettes!"
FNG_Collaborative_Equipment_Design: "Collaborative Equipment Design"
FNG_Collaborative_Equipment_Design_desc: "By partnering with Japanese manufacturers to create and streamline designs suited to the unique Chinese environment, we can produce superior weapons at a lower cost.

FNG_Modernized_Curriculum: "Modernised Curriculum"
FNG_Modernized_Curriculum_desc: "The modern Japanese curriculum, designed to counter Russian aggression on the plains of Manchuria, emphasises morale factors and tenacity of the will, stressing training designed to develop the ability to recognise opportunities for decisive attack; enveloping open enemy flanks, encircling formations, and thus destroying numerically and technologically superior forces."
FNG_Moral_Indoctrination: "Moral Indoctrination"

FNG_Lessons_from_the_Zhifeng_Wars_desc: "The last Zhili-Fengtian War saw the Fengtian Army fighting enemies whose weapons and technology far outclassed their own. Through trials of fire and blood, improvised weapons and unusual methods emerged to suit the new environment, allowing our soldiers to punch above their weight."
FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty: "Ties of Loyalty"
FNG_Ties_of_Loyalty_desc: "The Army's leadership structure is virtually feudal, and most of our generals and troops owe their personal loyalty to the Grand Marshal, instead of any abstract concept of state. This has its obvious disadvantages, but strengthening these ties will help to resist Japanese interference."
#Chinese Equipment Section
FNG_Rearming_the_Northeast: "Rearm the Northeast"
FNG_Rearming_the_Northeast_desc: "The Shenyang Arsenal was once China's greatest military-industrial enterprise, but the past decade has seen it eclipsed by the combined production of other Chinese arsenals, such as those at Hanyang, Baoding, and Jiangnan. We must reclaim our place at the top, and in doing so reduce our reliance on Japanese military aid. We can begin by stamping out corruption and increasing production quotas."
FNG_Diversify_Armament_Production: "Diversify Armament Production"
FNG_Diversify_Armament_Production_desc: "The Shenyang Arsenal has always been a massive but totally centralized operation, with one single plant and sub-factories in the Shenyang area accounting for the entirety of the Northeast's armament production. Eventually, size becomes a burden. We must consider diversifying our equipment manufacturing process to include components built at separate plants, or even by private companies."
FNG_Zaibatsu_Investments: "Zaibatsu Investments"
FNG_Zaibatsu_Investments_desc: "By opening our armaments industry to the Zaibatsu we are inevitably inviting increased Japanese influence in Manchuria. However, they can provide more money than we could ever afford to spend, and their manufacturing processes are far more sophisticated than our own."
FNG_Jigyou_Hikaku: "Jigyou Hikaku"
FNG_Jigyou_Hikaku_desc: "The Japanese have recommended that our military-industrial enterprises adopt a strategy of comparing business results, or 'Jigyou Hikaku', in which proprietary data on production is disclosed.

FNG_Reorganize_the_Coastal_Defence_Forces: "Reorganise the Coastal Defence Forces"
FNG_Reorganize_the_Coastal_Defence_Forces_desc: "Because the Fengtian Navy has no realistic way of opposing the larger and newer navy fielded by [QIE.GetNameDef], its main purpose is coastal defence. In light of recent troubling inadequacies, such as one ship's crew selling their armament on the black market, extensive reorganisation and reform is necessary."

FNG_Regular_River_Patrols_desc: "The Navy possesses number of small patrol boats, occasionally used to police the Yalu and Songhua rivers, but the majority of which are currently rusting away in storage.

FNG_Re-Forming_the_Marine_Corps_desc: "A marine corps was created in 1914, called the 'Republic of China Marine Corps,' but this attempt went nowhere. We will revive the China Marine Corps along modern lines, enabling us to better operate in riverine environments like the Huang He and Yangtze.

FNG_Commission_Japanese_Ships: "Commission Japanese Ships"
FNG_Commission_Japanese_Ships_desc: "There can be no doubt that our own ship-building capabilities pale compared to those of the Imperial Japanese Navy.

FNG_Request_Air_Shipment_desc: "While we have a strong air force in comparison to most warlords, our air force still lacks behind the [QIE.GetName] air force in size and modernity, as they are supplied with modern German aircraft.

FNG_The_China_Flying_Corps: "Restructure the China Flying Corps"
FNG_The_China_Flying_Corps_desc: "Originally organised by the Grand Marshal's son, Zhang Xueliang, the Corps performed well in the last war, losing air superiority only upon the arrival of more modern German-piloted planes. Since then it's expanded, but retains aircraft decades behind Western standards."
FNG_Order_New_Aircraft: "Request Aircraft Blueprints"
FNG_Order_New_Aircraft_desc: "True aircraft design requires well educated and extremely specialised engineers, which we sadly don't have access to. As a result, in order to improve our air force, we must order more from Japan."

FNG_Shoutai_Tactics: "Shoutai Tactics"
FNG_Shoutai_Tactics_desc: "Enormous advances in aircraft design in recent years have produced planes that fly completely differently than their predecessors, requiring reevaluations of flight manoeuvring and tactics.

FNG_Building_the_Road_to_Federalism_desc: "A promise made to Chen Jiongming was to approve the creation of democratically elected provincial assemblies, organized according to provincial constitutions. The Central Government will now make allowances for these activities, but it reserves the right to appoint governors, each of whom wields the power to veto any distasteful decisions made by these provincial assemblies."

FNG_Land_to_the_Tiller: "Land to the Tiller"
FNG_Land_to_the_Tiller_desc: "A federalist proposal, the Land to the Tiller program is one of reasonable land reform that will benefit both peasants and landowners. While it's implementation will certainly be costly, it is the way to both modernize the agrarian economy of China and reduce poverty among the cripplingly-poor peasants of the country. Through this, the popularity and trust of the people in the Diarchy of our republic will be all but assured."

FNG_Federalist_Literacy_Campaign: "Scour Illiteracy from the Provinces"
FNG_Federalist_Literacy_Campaign_desc: "While democracy is all well and good, it means little to those unable to understand it, a chief cause of this being illiteracy. It is such that at present, only one in five citizens can read and write, and in those most destitute regions of the interior, it is even worse. This great demon of ignorance holds the nation back, away from prosperity, away from democracy, away from the future. Chen and Zhang have thus declared a grand promise, in 30 years, every town and village in China shall have a school held to national standards, a monumental goal no doubt, but seem intent to deliver."

FNG_School_is_Cool: "Establish Founts of Knowledge"
FNG_School_is_Cool_desc: "While the government pushes for the districution of widely availiable education, with the relative lack of development much of China enjoys, even Chen must acknoledge that for the heighest levels of learning, efforts must be focused on establishing competent institutions in population centers first before it is possible for all of China to enjoy the same privileges. Therefore, building upon the foundation of our growing literate population, universities are to be expanded and built in the provincial capitals so as to cultivate a larger professional class."

FNG_Balans: "President and Provinces"
FNG_Balans_desc: "Chen Jiongming famously modelled his vision for a Federalist China after the USA, complete with their seperate branches of government to divide the powers of the executive. As compromise between their goals, our republic shall subordinate these branches beneath the President, whom is the only authority able to directly intervene into provincial matters through appointed govenors. Hopefully this will establish a passable peace and balance between the Executive Zhuolin demands, and the Provinces Chen wishes to empower."

FNG_Civilian_Recruitment: "Distance Generals from the Barracks"
FNG_Civilian_Recruitment_desc: "A cornerstone of Chen's vision was to separate "Militarist" generals from potential absues of their power by subordinating them entirely to a central Federal Army, obviously incompatible with current circumstances, a solution has been drafted, the Generals shall keep their posts and stations as govenors, however they are barred from directly recruiting their armies, and must instead negotiate for manpower with provinces apart from their own, this restricts the ability of the Army to centralize force away from the provinces elegantly while preserving a necessary status quo."

FNG_Patriots: "Party Patriotism for the Pages"
FNG_Patriots_desc: "While Chen holds the autonomy of provincial democracy paramount in most cases, Zhang has seen fit to enforce a platform of patriotic education through the new network of schools that have been established in the nationwide literacy campaign, seeking to retain the united Chinese identity of the people that might in his eyes be weakened by excessive decentralization, it also aims to teach the value of Chinese history, culture and the contribution of it's armed forces to the cause of the Republic. Chen of course, is not best pleased by such an intrusion, but has been persuaded by promises that other impositions are for now, off the table."

FNG_Fed_Healthcare: "Healthcare from the Bottom up"
FNG_Fed_Healthcare_desc: "Another one of Chen's grand ambitions for a republic, was a national healcare system for China, a difficult undertaking no doubt. In facct, the percieved difficulty of founding such an institution has been such that paradoxically, Chen has been forced to compromise once again by diverting responsibilities away from, rather than to the central government. Keeping in mind the no doubt massive expense of such a system, it has been agreed upon that for now, outside of the largest population centers, national healthcare must be financed and provided on a provincial level, rather than by the national government."

One such core contention is the disagreement over what role our coalition of parties should take in our Republic. Chen's federalist principles prescribe that democracy is best instilled bottom up, a belief directly at odds with the KMT who prescribe a party state to prepare for democracy from the top down. To say nothing of what the Grand marshal thinks about relinquishing power. The compromise reached is that the Zhang Zhuolin shall remain in control of the head of state while a KMT representative assumes the post of the head of government and the federalists can freely establish provincial assemblies under the supervision of the central government, which will remain under the control of the combined Tongmenghui"

Since 1928, when Fengtian was passed the torch of the xinhai revolution, the Constitution has remained suspended due to strategic necessity. However now we know better, the true error of the times was the self serving ambition and infighting of ideologues taking advantage of mock republicanism in their pursuit of power.

### New Fengtian Events ###
fengtian.1.t: "Rumors Incite Regionalist Uproar"
fengtian.1.d: "Although no plans have been made public, or even exist in anything approaching a final form, rumors have already begun to spread that the Fengtian Army is preparing to march south and conquer Beijing within the next month. The scattered news coming in from the south have inspired a potent mix of excitement and concern, and confrontations have already broken out in tea rooms, bars, and other public places between ardent nationalists and regionalist 'Dongbei Party' members.\n\nThe 'Dongbei Party' is not a political party in any real sense, and more a nickname applied by detractors to any espousing doubts about Zhang Zuolin's mission to reunite the country. A significant number of local officials and bureaucrats, including school teachers, share this kind of skepticism and have begun organizing protests criticizing what they view as a costly and unnecessary war.\n\nNaturally, the government will not refute the rumors, as that might free up Beijing's hand to intervene in the League Crisis."
fengtian.1.a: "Rumors can be dangerous..."
fengtian.3.t: "Regionalists Take Action"
fengtian.3.d1: "Shouting 'Donbgei weile Dongbeiren' or 'The Northeast for Northeastern People', protesters have gathered near the Grand Marshal's palace, in Harbin's Sophia Square, and outside Jilin's Medical College demanding an end to war preparations. Their numbers are not great enough to present serious problems, and police have already been dispatched to maintain order, but this is only part of an ongoing campaign which threatens to undermine public confidence in the regime. If the whole of the Northeast cannot be united behind the Grand Marshal's dream to reunite all of China, then how can it ever be realized?"
fengtian.3.d2: "protesters gathered again in several prominent locations in Northeastern cities. Their numbers were not great enough to present serious problems, but that did not stop police from cracking down hard, wading into the masses with clubs and rifle butts, and scattering fleeing protesters into crowded side streets. Angered by the violence, some 'Dongbei Party' members have already vowed to return in even greater numbers, but it is hoped that this quick and decisive response will deter all but the movement's hard-liners, making them all the easier to round-up and silence.\n\nMore concerning is talk among members of local trade associations, chambers of commerce, and town assemblies of a tax boycott. Unlike some of the young students, these older men remember the hard times late last decade when war expenditures outgrew the Northeastern economy and sent it into economic freefall."
fengtian.3.d3: "Despite efforts by the police regionalist protests have continued sporadically across the Northeast, and have been given further weight by support from local chambers of commerce, currency exchanges, and other business institutions concerned about the economic costs of a war to the south. While this currently appears to be posturing, there is no telling whether these groups will undermine the war-effort when the decisive moment comes, and while the public protests have yet to turn violent it may be only a matter of time. The sooner this problem is addressed the better."
fengtian.3.d4: "News of continued conflicts to the south have given the regionalist movement renewed momentum. Attempts at suppression have been continually hampered by the unwillingness of some sympathetic bureaucrats, police chiefs, and other officials to carry out their duties in full. Undoubtedly a complete effort will need to be made to root out these frustrating elements and restore order. As the public discontent continues the legitimacy and strength of our government is gradually sapped away."
fengtian.3.a: "Unfortunate"
fengtian.4.t: "Agent Provocateurs in Action"
fengtian.4.d: "Just as planned, our well-placed agents have successfully pushed some in the regionalist movement toward violence. Already increasingly violent protests have caused damage to public property, and reactions have been negative. It may only be a matter of time before we have the justification we need."
fengtian.4.a: "Excellent"
fengtian.5.t: "The Harbin Riots"
fengtian.5.d: "A protest rapidly escalated into an all-out riot last night, as protesters clashed with police in downtown Harbin. There have been fifteen recorded deaths, with unknown numbers of wounded on both sides, numbers possibly stretching into the low hundreds. Of particular concern is the Harbin Central Station which saw its front windows shattered, and its roof in flames. Damage to the station and several pieces of rolling stock have delayed travel along connecting rail lines, and the bureaucrats at Mantetsu have already registered their outrage.\n\nCleaning up this mess may take some time, but at least we now have a clear justification for action against the regionalist movement."
fengtian.5.a: "Good... and bad."
fengtian.6.t: "Mass Arrests Begin"
fengtian.6.d: "With the appropriate justification now in place, our dutiful police officers, with support from local militia and the Fengtian Army, have begun rounding up suspected protesters. The majority will eventually be sent home, but not necessarily in one piece. Hopefully, their imprisonment will serve as a message to the other protesters, and any sympathisers, that the government will no longer tolerate their subversion."
fengtian.6.a: "Good riddance"
fengtian.7.t: "An Offer from the Kempeitai"
fengtian.7.d: "The Kempeitai, the Japanese Army's extrajudicial police force, have taken note of our regionalist problem and come forward with a partial solution. With a wide network of informants, they claim to have information on a number of figures underpinning the regionalist movement - information they have volunteered. In response, we must provide intelligence on several anti-Japanese agitators and insurgents who have so far slipped through their fingers; not in the least due to our own interference. So far it has been convenient for us to keep in contact with these nationalists, pending cases where we need to push back against Japanese influence.\n\nIs this one of those cases? Or should we take the deal and offer these people up on a silver platter?"
fengtian.7.a: "Take the deal"
fengtian.7.b: "No thank you"
fengtian.8.t: "Regionalist Movement Suppressed"
fengtian.8.d: "The 'Dongbei Party', and the regionalist movement in general, have been suppressed at last. While this is not an end to regionalist sentiment in the Northeast, it may last for decades to come, but for now it has ceased to be a consideration as we turn our attention southward."
fengtian.8.a: "Progress."
#The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling
fengtian.9.t: "Picking up the Educational Slack"
fengtian.9.d: "Our targeted removal of regionalist 'Dongbei Party' school teachers and other intellectuals has predictably led to educational chaos and major research interruptions, but staffers at the Japanese Consulate have come forward with a possible solution. Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At our behest, the Japanese government might pressure Mantetsu to open these to the public and provide staff to fill temporary shortages.\n\nOnce we open the door to this kind of activity it will be very difficult to close, and these schools will almost certainly be used to spread Japanese culture and norms. We should consider carefully."
fengtian.9.a: "Decline the offer."
fengtian.9.b: "Accept the offer."
fengtian.10.t: "The Kimono Scandal"
fengtian.10.d: "Scandal! In a most unfortunate turn of events, the Grand Marshal's youngest daughter has been photographed wearing a Japanese Kimono during a photo-session at the Mantetsu-run 'Hokutou Kokuritsudaigaku' or 'Northeast National Academy'. Despite risk of arrest, word of the photo has already spread widely, along with a few copies of the image itself, though local and national news agencies know better than to print this defamation. Some agents in the military's intelligence branch speculate that the image was intentionally taken and spread by the Japanese as a means of punishing the government for recent actions, but no supporting evidence has emerged.\n\nThere is little question, however, that our enemies will use this opportunity to spread their nefarious propaganda."
fengtian.10.a: "What an embarrassment!"
fengtian.10.b: "Close the Mantetsu schools!"
fengtian.11.t: "Students Join the Youth League"
fengtian.11.d: "In an embarrassing and deeply damaging incident, a band of Chinese school children from Changchun recently announced their intention to join the Fengtian Youth League, which actively promotes Japanese interests in our country. Obviously their young minds are easily impressionable, but their parade through the streets of their home city, waving Japanese flags, has disgusted many and invited outright enmity towawrd the government. Parents weep, asking how their children could become so warped, and demand an alternative to these dangerous Japanese-run schools."
fengtian.11.a: "This is an outrage!"
fengtian.11.b: "Close the schools!"
fengtian.12.t: "Chinese Uniforms for Chinese Students"
fengtian.12.d: "After the demoralizing effects of our harsh but necessary crack-down on 'Dongbei Party' teachers, our Education Ministry has come forward with a new national school uniform. While this may seem like a small change, the uniforms are a symbol of Chinese independence and national identity stretching beyond any particular region. Surely a bright new future awaits our students as part of a united China!"
fengtian.12.a: "A point of pride!"
#NTC Railway Construction
fengtian.13.t: "Building the Jilin-Hailong Line"
fengtian.13.d: "With the reorganisation of the Northeast Transportation Committee complete, several new railways have been proposed for construction and, in some cases, completion. The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays due to the eruption of war in the south, and Japanese attempts to stall construction. The line has been operating in a limited capacity since 1931 but remains incomplete, with a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThese companies, in the abscence of Mantetsu and Japanese engineers, will do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."
fengtian.13.d_jap: "With the reorganisation of the Northeast Transportation Committee complete, several new railways have been proposed for construction and, in some cases, completion. The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays due to the eruption of war in the south, and Japanese attempts to stall construction. The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incomplete, with both Mantetsu and a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThe Japanese claim, and perhaps correctly, that they could have the railway complete in half the time due to their resources and expertise, but choosing a Chinese company would do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."
fengtian.13.a: "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.13.b: "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.14.t: "The Jilin-Hailong Line is Complete"
fengtian.14.d: "After months of construction and various unfortunate delays, the Jilin-Hailong line is finally complete, extending the reach of our main rail system into areas otherwise difficult to access. After reviewing plans and available resources, the NTC will undoubtedly prepare to issue another contract."
fengtian.14.a: "Great news!"
fengtian.15.t: "Building the Changchun-Dailai Line"
fengtian.15.d: "The NTC's next major project is the Changchun-Dalai Line, which was originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities. This work in particular serves a strategic purpose, as it should ease the movement of men and materials from north to south significantly."
fengtian.15.d_jap: "The NTC's next major project is the Changchun-Dalai Line, which was originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities. This work in particular serves a strategic purpose, as it should ease the movement of men and materials from North to South significantly. While the line does have Japanese origins and would serve to extend Mantetsu's reach, NTC planners nonetheless note its practical value. As before, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction process themselves, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."
fengtian.15.a: "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.15.b: "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.16.t: "The Changchun-Dailai Line is Complete"
fengtian.16.d: "The new Changchun-Dailai line now stands among the most modern in China, taking full advantage of more recent technologies, and visually demonstrating the sheer gap in time between the older lines originating in the 1920s. Truly, the Northeast is moving toward a brighter future."
fengtian.16.a: "Excellent!"
fengtian.17.t: "Building the Taonan-Suolun Line"
fengtian.17.d: "The last of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line which, like other recent projects, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway."
fengtian.17.d_jap: "The last of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line which, like other recent works, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway, theoretically keeping Mantetsu's creeping influence further from its operations. All the same, Mantetsu offers to construct the railroad, likely hoping to salvage at least something from the situation."
fengtian.17.a: "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.17.b: "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.18.t: "The Taonan-Suolun Line is Complete"
fengtian.18.d: "With the completion of the Taonan-Suolin Line, the Northeast Transportation Commission can focus on smaller projects, and on ensuring that China's railways remain Chinese. This second task will undoubtedly be a challenge all to itself."
fengtian.18.a: "Wansui!"
fengtian.19.t: "Railway Construction Workers Strike!"
fengtian.19.d: "Chinese workers, complaining of inadequate pay and difficult working conditions, have refused to return to work in a carefully coordinated strike. Despite the presence of railway unions in the Northeast, their coordination in this instance suggests the involvement of the Communications Clique, possibly as part of an attempt to demonstrate their influence or retaliate for some perceived slight.\n\nWhile this turn of events effects them too, the Japanese are happy to watch us squabble amongst ourselves. The strike will end, but not without causing significant delays."
fengtian.19.a: "Unfortunate."
fengtian.20.t: "Delays Plague Railway Construction"
fengtian.20.d: "The nature of the situation was fairly clear as soon as the first signs appeared; shipments unaccountably missing, rails laid at just enough of an incorrect angle to require complete re-construction, and sudden inspections of the labour force by Japanese agents supposedly seeking 'dangerous criminals'; inspections which inevitably required the suspension of work.\n\nThese same tactics were employed by the Japanese during the 1920s against the Fengtian Clique's railway projects, attempting to slow and discredit Chinese construction in order to limit competition to Mantetsu, and now they seem to be delaying our efforts once again. Unfortunately, there is little we can do."
fengtian.20.a: "Frustrating."
fengtian.21.t: "Delays Plague Mantetsu Railway Construction"
fengtian.21.d: "Despite Mantetsu's excellent engineers and equipment, the current railway construction project has encountered repeated delays as workers unaccountably go missing, materials vanish in the night, and bandits raid the camps alongside the rails, only to disappear before Japanese troops arrive.\n\nThe local police and our intelligence services are unwilling to do much to investigate or solve these repeated incidents, instead preferring to watch the Japanese squirm. The fact that Mantetsu received the contract to build the railway is well known to the public, and some patriotic citizens appear to have taken matters into their own hands."
fengtian.21.a: "What a pity."
#Imperial Fury/Japanese Aid Cut
fengtian.22.t: "Imperial Fury"
fengtian.22.d: "Infuriated, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.d_influence_low: "Worried by the decreasing power of their political proxy in the Assembly, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.d_fengtian_refuses_food: "Incensed by what they see as impertinence, the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.d_fengtian_blames_japan: "Incensed by our 'grave insolence', the Japanese government today issued a statement declaring an end to various Fengtian aid programs, including sectors such as research, industrial development, agricultural development, and military armament. The aid should return in some time, as the Japanese cannot afford to let us grow too weak, but until then many functions of our state are crippled."
fengtian.22.a: "A hard lesson."
fengtian.22.b: "Expel their officers in retaliation!"
fengtian.23.t: "Japanese Aid Returns"
fengtian.23.d: "Apparently feeling that their lesson in obedience is clear and punishing enough, the Japanese have resumed their aid. We should be careful about provoking them in the future, and make sure not to push the Concordia Association too far out of the Assembly before we are ready."
fengtian.23.a: "At last!"
#Clearing Investment Dearth
fengtian.24.t: "Wu Jinglian Criticises Japan"
fengtian.24.d: "Citing the recent expansion of the Japanese military garrison in Shenyang, Wu Jinglian launched a scathing criticism of Japan and its foreign policy from the Assembly floor. Though other politicians have been known to disparage the Japanese in the past, the post of Foreign Minister gives Wu's words a different kind of significance, and elevates them above the confines of the Assembly.\n\nWasting no time, the Japanese Consul-General has already demanded that we remove Minister Wu from office."
fengtian.24.a: "Oh dear."
fengtian.24.b: "Japan is our fraternal ally..."
fengtian.25.t: "Japanese Investment in Glass, Paper, and Textiles"
fengtian.25.d: "Thanks to our financial incentives, representatives of the Mitsui Zaibatsu have indicated a willingness to invest heavily in local businesses, specifically Dongxing Dye & Textile Company, Fengtian Industrial Paper, and Manchurian Glass. With controlling shares in all three companies, Mitsui seems likely to dominate our glass, paper, and textile industries for the foreseeable future, with only Mantetsu as competition."
fengtian.25.a: "Good news."
fengtian.25.b: "Block the investment."
fengtian.26.t: "Japanese Investment in Shipping and Tourism"
fengtian.26.d: "Ever since the establishment of its Yamato Hotel line, Mantetsu has actively promoted tourism in Fengtian, drawing wealthy and middle class tourists from the Home Islands to travel about Manchuria's 'exotic landscape' on its state of the art railways. In all that time, however, it has never extended its tourist ambitions to the sea.\n\nA small group of wealthy investors from Tokyo now intend to partner with several local shipping companies and establish a water-borne alternative to Mantetsu's railway tourism, while performing shipping services on the side, thus creating 'Bohai Waterborne Enterprises'.\n\nNone of this would be possible withour our efforts to encourage Sino-Japanese business partnership."
fengtian.26.a: "Good news."
fengtian.26.b: "Block the investment."
fengtian.27.t: "Japanese Investment in Metals and Minerals"
fengtian.27.d: "After talks with government representatives, the Sumitomo Zaibatsu has agreed to partially fund metals and mineral prospecting across Fengtian, in return for a proportional share in any companies created to extract any resources discovered. With rumors of gold in the Khigan Mountains and Tungsten in Fengtian Province, their investment seems likely to pan out."
fengtian.27.a: "Good news."
fengtian.27.b: "Block the investment."
fengtian.28.t: "Japanese Investment in Steel"
fengtian.28.d: "Mantetsu has long held Anshan Iron & Steel, China's largest steel processing company, as its subsidiary, and with recent government funded expansion of the Anshan Mines and an atmosphere ripe for investment, it has decided to invest further capital in modernising and expanding the company's operations."
fengtian.28.a: "Good news."
fengtian.28.b: "Block the investment."
fengtian.29.t: "Wu Jinglian Negotiates New Trade terms"
fengtian.29.d: "The [QIE.GetAdjective]-German embargo on goods moving to and from the Northeast hit its economy hard. Recovery came largely as a product of trade handled with the Legation Cities as an intermediary, allowing the embargo to be sidestepped, but at the cost of additional tariffs and reliance on third parties. With Shanghai businesses, both legitimate and illegitimate, fully aware of their control over an entire region's trade, trade deals have always been lacklustre despite their necessity.\n\nSomehow Wu Jinglian has managed to push through years of negotiations however, and secured a deal offering better terms for trade. Rumours swirl that a number of palms were greased in the process, but nobody seems to want to ask questions."
fengtian.29.a: "Excellent!"
fengtian.30.t: "Chinese Investment in Industrial Materials"
fengtian.30.d: "Encouraged by our investment incentives, and worried by Japanese dominance of Fengtian's heavy industry sector, several wealthy businessmen with ties to the Communications Clique have pooled their resources to invest heavily in several promising companies in Jinzhou, namely Zhaozin Ceramics Company, Jinzhou Railway Machinery, and the Northeastern Chemical Leather Plant."
fengtian.30.a: "Good news."
fengtian.30.b: "Block the investment."
fengtian.31.t: "Chinese Investment in Heilongjiang"
fengtian.31.d: "With Japanese investment often flooding into heavy industry and mining, a group of local investors have decided to pool their resources in order to back two Chinese companies struggling against Mantetsu competition. The Dongdai Fertiliser company and Shanjing Packing Plant will both continue to help Fengtian's burgeoning soy industry expand into the Northeastern frontier."
fengtian.31.a: "Good news."
fengtian.31.b: "Block the investment."
fengtian.32.t: "A New Automobile Company"
fengtian.32.d: "Thanks to the Shenyang Arsenal's regular production of the Minsheng Truck and our efforts to encourage sino-japanese cooperation, a group of Communications Clique oligarchs have partnered with the Jidosha-Seizo Company, subsidiary to the Nihon Sangyo Zaibatsu, to fund the creation of a new automobile factory in Fengtian Province. Already a collection of young engineers, mostly educated in Japan, are studying the prospects of more modern consumer-oriented Minsheng-inspired models."
fengtian.32.a: "Good news!"
fengtian.32.b: "Block the investment."
fengtian.33.t: "An End to the Investment Shortage"
fengtian.33.d: "After roughly a decade of limited external or internal investment beyond the government's own, Fengtian has made itself a reliable and trustworthy location for prosperous growth. Going from strength to strength, and with the fires of industry behind us, our prospects of retaking the country are growing by the day.\n\nAs we begin other development projects, we should begin to see our investment efforts open up related opportunities."
fengtian.33.a: "Finally!"
#The Hiroshima Proposal
fengtian.34.t: "Red Spears in Cangzhou!"
fengtian.34.d: "Bands of Red Spears, peasant self-defense units which are often little better than bandits, have grown in size and strength across Cangzhou recently, especially along the Zhili-Shandong border. As the new rulers in the area, we are expected to maintain peace and order, which has now been substantially disturbed. Several local garrisons have been attacked, villages burned, and towns raided. Forces have already been dispatched to deal with the issue, but a concerted effort to wipe out resistance in the rear areas, behind our front lines, is likely needed to deal with them permanently."
fengtian.34.a: "Damn pesants!"
fengtian.35.t: "Deserters Rise up in Daming!"
fengtian.35.d: "When our troops swept through Zhili province, they crushed all signs of organized resistance, but sometimes resistance isn't so organized. Groups of deserters, stemming from our enemy's former armies and our own forces, have begun organizing in order to take on larger targets across Daming. Several trains in the vicinity of Shimen have come under attack, and have caused our logisticians serious concern due to the Jinhan Line's major strategic importance. Local garrisons will be mobilized to deal with the issue, but matters such as these behind our lines deserve a coordinated response."
fengtian.35.a: "Traitors the lot of them!"
fengtian.36.t: "Warlords Resist in Ruyang"
fengtian.36.d: "Composed as they are of informal patronage networks, not all local power structures can be co-opted by our occupying forces. In this case, several local warlords formerly loyal to Wu Peifu have seemingly taken offense at our policies in Ruyang, and seized the Gongxian Arsenal at Xinyang. Despite their relative organization and the weapons from the arsenal, their troops are still too few and too ill-equipped to combat our own on a large scale, but they will nontheless force us to divert forces away from the front lines. We need a coherent response to these cases of resistance."
fengtian.36.a: "Fools."
fengtian.37.t: "Bandits Sweep Guanzhong"
fengtian.37.d: "The mountains around Xi'an have been home to bandits since time immemorial, but now these brigands have come down from the hills and begun preying on hapless travelers, undefended villages, and most importantly our supply caravans. Due to their diffuse and disorganized nature, bandits can be difficult to track down and eliminate permanently. To do so we will undoubtedly need a coordinated effort."
fengtian.37.a: "Well what are we waiting for?"

#Soy Agricultural Initiative
fengtian.42.t: "The Soy Agricultural Initiative"
fengtian.42.d: "Soybeans are an extremely flexible crop, useful for human food, animal feed, fertiliser, and for a wide variety of industrial applications. Mantetsu's Research Wing has made great strides in making their growing, processing, and use more efficient, but planting percentages across Fengtian remain relatively stagnant. Korean farmers, who make up the majority of immigrants to Manchuria, are excellent rice planters, and like many Chinese prefer crops they have more experience with.\n\nIn an attempt to change this, Mantetsu began the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a plan intending to educate farmers and incentivise the production of soy as a cash crop, but it has so far been poorly received. Mantetsu hopes to gain the government's support in promoting the initiative, which would almost certainly increase soy yields and therefore long term profits.\n\nA few dissenting voices have pointed out that excessive soy production could reduce food security in the northeast, and in the right conditions might lead to a famine."
fengtian.42.a: "Back the Initiative."
fengtian.42.b: "We need no more soy."
fengtian.43.t: "Japan and Korea Struggle with Drought"
fengtian.43.d_fengtian_forced: "Both Japan and Korea are experiencing severe drought conditions, which we have fortunately been spared, but their economies and people now suffer, and some live on the brink of starvation. The Japanese government has formally demanded that we take part in a programme wherein we provide rice and millet to Korea, which in turn will provide rice to Japan. However, this plan is somewhat confounded by the overwhelming success of Mantetsu's Soy Agricultural Initiative, which replaced vast tracts of rice plots with soy farming. As a result, we have nowhere near enough rice and millet to feed Korea, while our soy production remains key to our industry and international trade.\n\nThanks to Japan's political and economic influence, we have little choice but to comply."
fengtian.43.d_fengtian_normal: "Both Japan and Korea are experiencing severe drought conditions, which we have fortunately been spared, but their economies and people now suffer, and some live on the brink of starvation. The Japanese government has informally asked that we take part in a programme wherein we provide rice and millet to Korea, which in turn will provide rice to Japan. However, this plan is somewhat confounded by the overwhelming success of Mantetsu's Soy Agricultural Initiative, which replaced vast tracts of rice plots with soy farming. As a result, we have nowhere near enough rice and millet to feed Korea, while our soy production remains key to our industry and international trade.\n\nThis is a surprising turn for the typically aloof Japanese, but all the same, while we may refuse, it would almost certainly be met with severe repercussions."
fengtian.43.a: "We will provide food."
fengtian.43.b: "Japan is on its own."
fengtian.44.t: "Food departs for Korea"
fengtian.44.d: "With Japan's proposal accepted, provisions are leaving from Yingkou for Incheon and other ports in Korea, as well as along the Anfeng and Gyeongui lines to Pyongyang. While starvation has yet to occur, it's difficult to portray the shipments leaving China's shores as anything other than an act of subservience to the Japanese."
fengtian.44.a: "We will endure."
fengtian.45.t: "The Industrial Soy Proposal"
fengtian.45.d: "In light of the current anti-drought measures which have resulted in low provisions across Fengtian and considerable public upset, some government ministers have proposed cutting production of industrial soy, thus providing sufficient food but handicapping our civilian industry and some exports until the crisis is resolved."
fengtian.45.a: "Cut Industrial Soy."
fengtian.45.b: "We cannot afford this."
fengtian.46.t: "The Drought Ends"
fengtian.46.d: "After months of hardship, the drought in Korea and Japan has ended."
fengtian.46.a: "Finally!"
#Hokkaido Farming
fengtian.47.t: "A Proposal from Mantetsu"
fengtian.47.d: "A representative from Mantetsu's Research Wing has come forward with a proposal, the acceptance of which he assures the government is in its best interest, but which he insists must be kept completely secret. Apparently, following the Drought of 1939, Mantetsu brought together farming experts, senior officials from agricultural organisations, and academic scholars with relevant expertise in order to lead an initiative with the aim of improving agricultural efficiency and production in Fengtian. After months of testing, one of several research teams created a solution based upon farming methods used in Hokkaido, which might allow the average Chinese family to farm ten entire hectares of land without needing to hire seasonal workers, thus improving production and freeing up labour for factories in Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang. The Mantetsu official indicates that these methods should be spread through the dissemination of informational leaflets and Chinese instructors, themselves trained by Japanese experts, and he seemed to stress the idea that this project should be disassociated in every possible way from the South Manchurian Railway.\n\nAfter some investigation, the Army's intelligence section has determined that the Kwantung Army refused to support Mantetsu's efforts for unclear reasons, suggesting that the two factions may be competing, or that this is simply a part of some elaborate Japanese ruse. The relatively liberal officials in Mantetsu's research wing and other bureaucratic roles have been known to clash with the conservative Kwantung Army."
fengtian.47.a: "Accept the proposal."
fengtian.47.b: "Refuse the proposal."

fengtian.48.t: "Hokkaido Farming Bears Fruit"
fengtian.48.d: "After much time and effort, the Hokkaido farming methods proposed by Mantetsu seem to be bearing fruit in some areas, increasing production, and freeing up additional land in the north."
fengtian.48.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.49.t: "Discovery"
fengtian.49.d: "Although neither made any public announcement, Mantetsu's research wing has communicated that the Kwantung Army discovered its farming collaboration with our government, a claim backed up by findings from our intelligence services. General Kekichi Ueda himself is said to have stormed into the office of the Mantetsu president, Yosuke Matsuoka, and delivered a thunderous verbal barrage regarding the necessity to keep Fengtian dependent upon Japanese aid. The Kwantung Army's ability to punish Mantetsu is ultimately limited, as the powerful company is practically autonomous, but there's little doubt that the Army will go out of its way to make things difficult for everyone involved. Unfortunately, this will certainly be the end of this specific collaboration project with Mantetsu."
fengtian.49.a: "Unfortunate."

fengtian.50.t: "Discovery"
fengtian.50.d: "Dr Y.C. James Yen, the leader of the Rural Reconstruction Movement, today denounced our collaboration with Mantetsu to bring Hokkaido farming styles to Fengtian, declaring that 'China must reform itself' and not submit to 'forced restructuring disguised as collaborative reform'. Our legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people will almost certainly be impacted severely by this turn of events. Some ministers suggest that we might defend our collaboration, painting it as an instance in which we are able to manipulate Mantetsu, instead of the other way around. Others suggest that this may simply dig our hole deeper."
fengtian.50.a: "Guilty as charged."
fengtian.50.b: "Our actions were legitimate!"

fengtian.51.t: "Popular Opinion Shifts in our Favour"
fengtian.51.d: "Against what seemed to be all odds, the government's defence of the Hokkaido farming project seems to have convinced not only Dr Yen, but also the vast majority of the population. The impact has been mitigated, and the programme can continue uninterrupted."
fengtian.51.a: "Wonderful news!"

fengtian.52.t: "The Public is Incensed!"
fengtian.52.d: "Despite our best efforts, both Dr Yen and the general public seem unconvinced by our defence of the Hokkaido Farming project. As a result, the programme will almost certainly grind to a halt, and the government's credibility has dwindled significantly."
fengtian.52.a: "Damn!"

#Focus Tree Specific Events

fengtian.53.t: "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.53.d: "After decades of decline and destitution, the necessity of progress and development has never been more glaring. However, while we cannot afford to stagnate, change comes with its own risks - namely mismanagement and public discontent.\n\nThe task falls to the government to answer calls to 'Enrich the Country and Strengthen the Army', but we must prioritise one or the other."
fengtian.53.a: "We must enrich the Country!"
fengtian.53.b: "We must strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.53.c: "Tell me more about the state of the Economy."
fengtian.53.e: "Tell me more about the state of the Army."

fengtian.54.t: "Enrich the Country"
fengtian.54.d: "While Manchuria's resources are rich and diverse, and Fengtian stands as the third greatest industrial centre in East Asia, its economy remains plagued by a number of structural problems, the symptoms of which cripple the state and slow progress toward Southern Reclamation. Fengtian's biggest investor is the state itself, feeding tax revenues back into key sectors such as steel, coal, and soybean production. Yet, the Japanese and Mantetsu trail the government only marginally in this regard, and invest far more widely, giving them an unquestioned grip upon both Fengtian's economy and society.\n\nWhile the extent of this grip grows by the day, reform could serve to increase the government's revenues through the suppression of otherwise endemic corruption, the creation of a healthier environment for private investment, and the unfortunate but necessary cooperation with Mantetsu in key areas like infrastructure and technology. So long as the government can maintain political autonomy, and at least a majority of control over the economy, it can pursue initiatives to contest Japanese influence, retain legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, and eventually achieve its core goals.\n\nIt should be noted that while Japan has a vested interest in seeing us succeed relative to [QIE.GetNameDef], they will only provide assistance with specific efforts aiming to move past our backward industry, even as they attempt to widen their already worrying influence over our economy."
fengtian.54.a: "Let us enrich the country!"
fengtian.54.b: "Perhaps the Army is more important?"

fengtian.55.t: "Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.55.d: "The Fengtian Army, officially the Army of the Republic, is an impressive sight by most Chinese standards, though pales in comparison to most foreign forces, and has only recently recovered much of its strength after its decimation in the last Zhifeng War. The majority of Fengtian's weapons and vehicles are outdated, even including its standard issue rifle provided by the Japanese, and organisation below the division level is a patchy affair due to limited communications equipment. The Army's greatest deficiency is in morale, partially as a consequence of foreign-trained and even outright Japanese officers widespread throughout the ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fengtian Flying Corps, officially The China Flying Corps, is the pride and joy of the Grand Marshal's oldest son, Zhang Xueliang, who used his passion for aviation to train its first pilots. The Flying Corps performed well during the war, and lost air superiority over the Zhili only upon the arrival of modern German-piloted planes. Since then, the Corps has grown slightly, though its planes remain over a decade behind the European standard.\n\nOverall, Fengtian's forces lag behind those of [QIE.GetNameDef], and remain heavily dependent upon Japanese equipment and aid. This aid, and whatever Fengtian can do to become self-sufficient, will be crucial to narrowing that gap and eventually reclaiming the south."
fengtian.55.a: "Let us strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.55.b: "But what of the economy?"

fengtian.56.t: "An Empty-Handed Return"
fengtian.56.d: "Despite their best efforts, the scientists and engineers we dispatched to study Japanese manufacturing methods have returned empty-handed. Perhaps the sheer disparity in sophistication between their technology and our own was a hinderance, or maybe the Japanese went out of their way to be unhelpful. Whatever the case, the general population seems to have been impressed more by the apparent accomplishment of our 'top men' than their failure, as this has gone mysteriously unreported. As far as anyone knows, our scientists went overseas to receive very prestigious awards."
fengtian.56.a: "Top men."

fengtian.57.t: "Reforming Manchurian Finance"
fengtian.57.d: "At the start of the 20th century, Manchuria was a poorly managed frontier, fraught by lawlessness and banditry. With the rule of Zhang, however, came rapid reforms through his finance minister Wang Yongjiang. Wang backed his currency, originally no different from those printed by other warlords, with silver, generating confidence which led to some gains in value against the Japanese Yen. Extensive tax reform solved outstanding debts, and by the early 1920s the economy was bolstered by immigrants fleeing instability throughout the rest of China.\n\nOf course, this could not last, and Minister Wang resigned in 1928 and died the next year. With Fengtian's economy only beginning to recover from eight years of post-war decline, the time has come to implement new reforms, inspired by those of the old, and return the Northeast to its rightful place as one of China's most prosperous regions.\n\nA minister must be chosen to draw up the necessary plans and determine priorities for government efforts."
fengtian.57.a: "Appoint Pan Fu."
fengtian.57.b: "Appoint Li Shaogeng."
fengtian.57.c: "Appoint Sun Qichang."
fengtian.57.e: "Appoint Ruan Zhenduo."

fengtian.58.t: "Yamato Hotel Licenses"
fengtian.58.d: "Mantetsu's Yamato Hotel line has long been a staple of the South Manchuria Railway Zone; the concessions zone ceded first to Imperial Russia and then to Japan after 1906, and then expanded following the 21 demands of 1915 through a rather loose interpretation of its provisions to include all of southern Manchuria. All the same, while treaty rights permit Japanese to reside and engage in business and manufacture of any kind, construction still theoretically requires approval from the local governor and, if necessary, the Grand Marshal himself.\n\nMantetsu aims to build a series of new hotels, all of which will inevitably become hubs for further Japanese activity, and while construction could never be stopped without angering the Japanese government, limits might be imposed to forestall Japanese influence in certain areas. Unfortunately, as much as they may stand as physical edifices of Japan's strength, the hotels are frequented by the Japanese elite and many Mantetsu employees, making them crucial for the rapid development we desire."
fengtian.58.a: "Limit construction."
fengtian.58.b: "Let them build as they please."

fengtian.59.t: "The Northeast Industrial Development Commission"
fengtian.59.d: "At Japan's request, and with no particular reason to refuse, we have established a legal and fiscal framework enabling the creation of the Northeast Industrial Development Commission. Serving to oversee and direct the development of Fengtian's industry, mostly through the allocation of funds and leases, the commission now faces the question of its composition.\n\nThe Concordia Association has proposed the inclusion of a series of extremely talented individuals with experience working for the Nissan and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu in Japan, who stress the need for an export driven economy taking advantage of Fengtian's existing natural resources, while the Grand Marshal's generals insist upon the necessity of an 'Army First' approach to development, and are using their considerable influence to ensure the placement of military men on the commission. The Communications Clique recommends their own presence, and advocate a mixed developmental approach, referencing their long experience with business dealings across China, as well as more recently here in the Northeast.\n\nUnfortunately, a compromise involving all three parties is practically impossible, as a clear vision is necessary for the task, and intra-commission bickering would almost certainly render it functionally impotent. Additionally, although the commission's nature as an appointed body permits the presence of Japanese in its makeup, the public and much of the Assembly will likely react negatively to their presence. At the same time, the Japanese will not appreciate exclusion."
fengtian.59.a: "Prioritise exports."
fengtian.59.b: "The army must come first."
fengtian.59.c: "A mixed approach is best."

fengtian.60.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū"
fengtian.60.d: "The South Manchuria Railway Company's Research Wing, colloquially known as 'Mantetsu Chosabū', has grown over the years from a mere corporate R&D department into the heart of Japan's colonial research programme, with divisions dedicated to everything from agricultural science to intelligence gathering. The sheer scale of Mantetsu Chosabū and its ambitions has lead to the opening of offices in Berlin, Vancouver, and New York to attract foreign talent, and wide recruitment from Japan's foremost universities. The result is a surprisingly liberal and open minded intellectual community, which sometimes goes places scientific inquiry before nationalistic concerns.\n\nThis appears to be one of those instances, as our government has been approached by a Chosabū representative offering future assistance in one of several fields. It should be noted that the Kwantung Army garrison in [GetDalianName] were strongly opposed to this arrangement."
fengtian.60.a: "Radar."
fengtian.60.b: "Construction."
fengtian.60.c: "Production Efficiency."
fengtian.60.e: "Intelligence."

fengtian.61.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Radar Collaboration"
fengtian.61.d: "In light of Japan's recent technological developments in radar, scientists from Mantetsu's research wing have begun to collaborate with our own, so that we may sooner achieve the same level of advancement."
fengtian.61.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.62.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Radar Collaboration"
fengtian.62.d: "In light of Japan's recent technological developments in radar, scientists from Mantetsu's research wing have begun to collaborate with our own, so that we may sooner achieve the same level of advancement."
fengtian.62.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.63.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Construction Collaboration"
fengtian.63.d: "In light of Japan's recent developments, officials from Mantetsu's research wing have begun to collaborate with our own, providing new tools and best practices so that we may sooner achieve the same level of advancement."
fengtian.63.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.64.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Construction Collaboration"
fengtian.64.d: "In light of Japan's recent developments, officials from Mantetsu's research wing have begun to collaborate with our own, providing new tools and best practices so that we may sooner achieve the same level of advancement."
fengtian.64.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.65.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Production Collaboration"
fengtian.65.d: "In light of Japan's recent technological developments, scientists from Mantetsu's research wing have begun to collaborate with our own, providing new machines and manufacturing practices so that we may sooner achieve the same level of advancement."
fengtian.65.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.66.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Production Collaboration"
fengtian.66.d: "In light of Japan's recent technological developments, scientists from Mantetsu's research wing have begun to collaborate with our own, providing new machines and manufacturing practices so that we may sooner achieve the same level of advancement."
fengtian.66.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.67.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Intelligence Collaboration"
fengtian.67.d: "Drawing from its wide-ranging intelligence operations, Mantetsu's research wing has provided a series of manuals detailing special methods and best-practices for our covert operatives. Although the books are clearly out of date, and certain sections have been redacted, there is still much to learn. Of particular interest is a work titled 'Rakka Ryūsui', or 'Falling Blossoms; Flowing Water' which details the work of Motojiro Akashi, Japan's premier spymaster during the Russo-Japanese War."
fengtian.67.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.68.t: "Mantetsu Chosabū Intelligence Collaboration"
fengtian.68.d: "Drawing from its wide-ranging intelligence operations, Mantetsu's research wing has provided our agents access to some of its clandestine resources spread across China. This will greatly improve our operative's capabilities."
fengtian.68.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.69.t: "The Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
fengtian.69.d: "Jinzhou's convenient location makes it excellent for a proposed industrial zone, and several groups have already begun jockeying for a dominant position in development; most notably a Mantetsu subsidiary specialising in canning and light metal work, the Communications Clique who want to establish a rolling stock factory, and the military which insists that the zone must be used for munitions manufacture ahead of 'personal capitalistic gains'. The situation is made somewhat unusual by the Communications Clique, who are usually able to front quite a bit of money, and rumours suggest that several members are under pressure from the military to weaken their own bidding position."
fengtian.69.a: "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.69.b: "Choose the Communications Clique."
fengtian.69.c: "Choose the Zhang Clique."

fengtian.70.t: "Filling the Silver Reserve"
fengtian.70.d: "A full silver reserve is crucial to building confidence in Fengtian's currency, and even more crucial to attracting foreign investment, without which Fengtian can never hope to match the Zhili to the south who have been, for the past eight years, flush with German capital. However, silver is an expensive commodity, and paying for enough to fill the reserve fully would undoubtedly cut funding from other areas.\n\nSome ministers have privately suggested only buying about half of the desired quantity, as many believed the reserve was less than full before the last Zhifeng War, and those rumours were never confirmed. Of course, it was later difficult to explain the significant economic recession that followed the government's inability to settle its war debts.\n\nStill, filling the reserve inadequately would certainly be a big risk, but perhaps a worthwhile one."
fengtian.70.a: "Fill the reserve."
fengtian.70.b: "No risk no reward."

fengtian.71.t: "Economic Disaster!"
fengtian.71.d: "After the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, major lenders to our own government, unexpectedly called for outstanding debts to be paid, our Central Bank suddenly found itself unable to provide sufficient silver for the transaction. News of the situation quickly leaked to the public provoking a run on the banks, and widespread financial panic. Rumour suggests that the crisis is not a product of gross mismanagement and incompetence on behalf of the government, which would surprise few in Fengtian, but rather a deliberate move to deceive the public. Mantetsu's offices in Shenyang and Harbin have already begun a full scale investigation, and unless action is taken they seem likely to discover a very incriminating paper trail.\n\nWhile there are several options available, it would be unfortunate if certain government files inexplicably went missing..."
fengtian.71.a: "Burn the evidence!"
fengtian.71.b: "Burn it and blame the Japanese!"
fengtian.71.c: "Ask Japan for a bailout!"
fengtian.71.e: "We must come clean!"

fengtian.72.t: "Banking Evidence Discovered!"
fengtian.72.d: "After a thorough investigation involving untold bribes and threats, Mantetsu investigators have concluded that our government intentionally deceived its people, and is entirely to blame for the recent financial disaster. We are in no position to refuse their calls for the arrests of several involved ministers, but conveniently the Grand Marshal and his closest advisers have been spared direct blame, and Mantetsu's Director Yosuke Matsuoka has suggested that in return for political favours, the entire matter could be shelved indefinitely."
fengtian.72.a: "Accept the offer."
fengtian.72.b: "Refuse the offer."

fengtian.73.t: "Japan Agrees to the Bailout"
fengtian.73.d: "In a move that will surely save our economy, Japan has agreed to pay for sufficient silver to fill our reserve, and will not look further into the matter. Of course, this was likely inspired by little more than self interest, but some say that Japan may not be so bad after all..."
fengtian.73.a: "We are saved!"

fengtian.74.t: "Japan Refuses the Bailout"
fengtian.74.d: "Despite our pleas, Japan has refused a bailout, leaving us in the same economic position we were before we made the request and with ample humiliation to boot. The only 'silver lining' is that many citizens, even including some employees of Mantetsu, have lost a great deal of faith in Japan's benevolent position toward China."
fengtian.74.a: "If only that was more than a metaphor."
fengtian.74.b: "Perhaps Minister Ruan can smooth things over."

fengtian.75.t: "The State of the Officer Corps"
fengtian.75.d: "Fengtian's officer corps is an unusual mix of young Chinese educated at the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō in Japan, older Chinese who served in the Civil Wars, and Japanese officers part of the Military Mission to Fengtian, all united by common loyalties to individuals more than any special dedication to the state. Japanese officers in particular are known to prize any station in the Northeast, the devalued currency allowing them to live lives of relative luxury, and hire servants for most menial tasks, earning them the enmity of not only their fellows but also the local population.\n\nNow, with the founding of the Shenyang National Academy, these officers have taken the opportunity to mock the academy's current accommodations, which are decades old and in disrepair. While a newer modern building rises nearby, the pitiful state of the academy at present leaves the government open to criticism."
fengtian.75.a: "Unfortunate."

fengtian.76.t: "Expel Japanese Officers"
fengtian.76.d: "Japan has maintained a military mission in Fengtian ever since the founding of the Fengtian Government in 1926, who were preceded by over a decade of informal Japanese operations in support of Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique. The Mission has served to aid many aspects of the military's development, primarily through the supply of arms and equipment, but also training and planning assistance.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the shortage of officers in the aftermath of the civil wars provided Japan with the opportunity to attach Japanese officers to command positions in the field, and even lead our units independently. This has had a negative effect upon the morale of our men, making Japan's influence all too obvious, even as the Military Mission attempts, and often succeeds, in influencing our affairs of government. In order for our soldiers and the Chinese people to have any respect for our Government, the Japanese Military Mission must leave."
fengtian.76.a: "Expel them all!"
fengtian.76.b: "Let us be diplomatic."

fengtian.77.t: "Japan Declares War"
fengtian.77.d: "In response to our expulsion of their officers, the Japanese Government has cut all ties and declared war! Many will look at this as a disaster, but perhaps it is an opportunity in disguise. The truth will be found on the battlefield."
fengtian.77.d_breakaway: "In response to what they see as a violation of our commitment to cooperation, as well as the Thirteen Demands of 1915, Japan has subsequently declared war 'in protection of its treaty rights and interests in China'."
fengtian.77.a: "Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!"

fengtian.78.t: "Japan Delivers an Ultimatum"
fengtian.78.d: "Despite our valiant attempts to remove the Japanese Military Mission, their influence in our government has proven to be too great, forcing its reinstatement. The only other option now would be a rejection of the ultimatum and a declaration of war, directed by the Grand Marshal himself."
fengtian.78.d_ultimatum: "Negotiations have failed and Japan has delivered a simple ultimatum. We must reinstate the mission or they will immediately declare war."
fengtian.78.a: "We have no choice but to submit."
fengtian.78.b: "Let there be war!"

fengtian.79.t: "Wu Wang Zai Ju"
fengtian.79.d: "Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin delivered a short but powerful speech alluding to the historical State of Qi which, when on the brink of defeat at the siege of Ju, turned the tide and eventually won the war. This is to be our example as we march forward against those who would keep China weak and divided."
fengtian.79.a: "Read the text of the speech."
fengtian.79.b: "Southern reclamation is inevitable!"

fengtian.80.t: "Retaking Inner Mongolia"
fengtian.80.d: "The time has come to return Inner Mongolia to the Chinese sphere, and once agains subjugate this upstart border region. We must prosecute the war with as much haste as possible."
fengtian.80.a: "Forward!"

fengtian.81.t: "Victory in Inner Mongolia"
fengtian.81.d: "After seizing Inner Mongolia and holding it against enemy counterattacks, we have successfully concluded a peace and achieved our goals. This is one small step in the struggle to reclaim all of China."
fengtian.81.a: "We have achieved our goals."
fengtian.81.b: "There will be no peace."

fengtian.1000.t: "[FNG.GetName] Has Offered Us Peace"
fengtian.1000.d: "The [FNG.GetName] has offered us peace if we concede their claims to them."
fengtian.1000.a: "A needed sacrifice"
fengtian.1000.b: "We will win this war"

fengtian.82.t: "Doihara's Proposal"
fengtian.82.d: "Colonel Doihara, the head of the Kwantung Garrison's intelligence section, has come forward with a proposal he intends to implement with or without our assistance, though the former would be very much preferred.\n\nThe German intervention effectively closed the vast majority of the Chinese market to Japanese products, including particularly profitable goods like the 'Golden Bat' cigarette. Doihara intends access the old market through the re-branding of these cigarettes as 'Golden Dragons', then sell them via the Legation Cities to avoid [QIE.GetAdjective] embargoes, and most crucially the insertion of trace amounts of opium to ensure quick addiction. All we would need to do is support poppy production in key areas of Liaobei and Xing'an, and in time the profits could begin to flow.\n\nDoihara is a thoroughly unsavoury character, and our involvement in such a project could undermine our political legitimacy, but the government desperately needs funds, and this might provide an edge against [QIE.GetNameDef]."
fengtian.82.a: "Support the proposal."
fengtian.82.b: "We will have nothing to do with this."

fengtian.83.t: "Golden Dragon Cigarettes"
fengtian.83.d: "The necessary preparations have been made, and production will soon begin. Judging by a telegraph message sent from Shanghai, Doihara intends to inform us of his progress over time."
fengtian.83.a: "Good."

fengtian.84.t: "Delays in Doihara's Plans"
fengtian.84.d: "Communications from Doihara have been infrequent, scattered, and often evasive, until more recently when a he suggested a meeting in the old Astor House Hotel in Shanghai. Conveying his apologies for delays in his programme over a very expensive meal in the elaborate dining room, Doihara seemed genuinely frustrated, but after returning, our agent has been careful to emphasise that progress is still on track and the money will be flowing soon.\n\nOther intelligence operatives in the Legation Cities, and other parts of China, tell a rather different story, and suggest that the operation is already profitable, with the vast majority of the money being used to fund Doihara's other subversive activities. The evidence seems to suggest that our representative in Shanghai has been bribed, but surely Doihara will eventually cough up what he's promised..."
fengtian.84.a: "Unfortunate."
fengtian.84.b: "We've had enough."

fengtian.85.t: "Further Delays"
fengtian.85.d: "Doihara has suggested another meeting, yet again after an extended period of limited communication, but this time in a secluded hideaway near Xiamen in Fujian Province. Insisting that he has run into trouble with the Green Gang, Doihara once again apologies for the delays, but insists that we will receive our funds within the next several months.\n\nMost of our operatives assigned to monitor Doihara's activities have mysteriously disappeared, so his actual status is difficult to ascertain."
fengtian.85.a: "Unfortunate."
fengtian.85.b: "We've had enough."

fengtian.86.t: "Doihara has Succeeded"
fengtian.86.d: "After a surprisingly short amount of time, considering the task at hand, Doihara has succeeded in establishing a reliable means of smuggling the opium-laced cigarettes into the rest of China, producing said cigarettes cheaply with our help, and selling them en-masse."
fengtian.86.a: "Excellent."
fengtian.86.b: "We've had enough"

fengtian.87.t: "Discovery and Failure"
fengtian.87.d: "After a rapid series of arrests both within [QIE.GetAdjective] jurisdiction and the Legation Cities, Doihara's plans appear to have failed, and the Colonel has cut all contact with us and presumably his former associates. Unfortunately, the [QIE.GetAdjective] seem to have discovered our involvement and publicised the evidence. The political impact has already been devastating."
fengtian.87.a: "Damn!"

fengtian.89.t: "Doihara's Fate"
fengtian.89.d: "One of our agents monitoring Doihara's progress has forwarded some unfortunate news. It seems that, in his efforts to secure profitable transfer rates in Shanghai, Doihara made enemies of the Green Gang Triad. His body was reportedly found outside a back-alley brothel alongside those of several bodyguards, identifiable only thanks to its uniform and testimonies from nearby civilians.\n\nKempeitai agents have already begun an investigation in partnership with the Shanghai Municipal Police, but for all intents and purposes Doihara's initiative can be considered dead in the water."
fengtian.89.a: "So be it."

fengtian.90.t: "Opium Addiction Spreads in [QIE.GetNameDef]"
fengtian.90.d: "Despite the best efforts of local officials and even [QIE.GetNameDef], opium addiction has slowly spread among the general population to levels rivalling those of the Tongzhi and Guangxu Eras, weakening the 'central government' and its armies. This is to our advantage, but if our efforts to bring this state of affairs about become public knowledge the public relations impact will be difficult to contain. The Opium trade has long been viewed as not only as an evil, but one brought about primarily as a tool of Western imperialism."
fengtian.90.a: "Unfortunate but necessary."

fengtian.91.t: "Escalating the Propaganda War"
fengtian.91.d: "Already the Propaganda Department is strenuously launching a devastating ideological barrage under which the regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] regime must surely crack and crumble! The Grand Marshal has personally released several short speeches denouncing \"the Kaiser's puppet in Asia\", [QIE.GetLeader], calling him \"lower than a dog\" for his \"cowardice and brazen collaboration with the German intruder\", and for \"selling out the Chinese people to foreign interests\". Just how much further can the illegitimate [QIE.GetAdjective] government bow before it topples?"
fengtian.91.d_mantetsu: "Already the Propaganda Department is redoubling its efforts in launching a devastating ideological barrage under which the regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] regime must surely crack and crumble! The Grand Marshal has personally released several short speeches denouncing "the Kaiser's puppet in Asia", [QIE.GetLeader], calling him "lower than a dog" for his "cowardice and brazen collaboration with the German intruder", and for "selling out the Chinese people to foreign interests".\n\nAt the same time, the degree of influence the Japanese hold over our own government is clear even to the lowest beggar, and so our efforts ring of hypocrisy in the ears of many."
fengtian.91.a: "Southern reclamation is inevitable!"

fengtian.92.t: "Obsolete Artillery from Japan"
fengtian.92.d: "In response to our request, the Imperial Japanese Army has authorized a sizable shipment of obsolete artillery that probably hasn't seen action since the Weltkrieg. This is disappointing, if not entirely unhelpful."
fengtian.92.a: "Good."

fengtian.94.d1: "The Fengtian Government has long possessed an advantage against its Chinese rivals thanks to our frequent material aid. In this particular case, we are being asked for artillery.\n\nWe could send the best we have, which ought to make a significant difference in such a backwards country, but we could also provide a greater number of cheap obsolete weapons at lesser cost to ourselves. Or we could always send nothing at all."
fengtian.94.d2: "The Fengtian Government has long possessed an advantage against its Chinese rivals thanks to our frequent material aid. In this particular case, we are being asked for artillery, which is especially prized among warlord arsenals."

fengtian.99.d: "Although the Japanese predictably refused to send us their latest armored equipment, only the most cynical anticipated the arrival of the rusting and dented Weltkrieg-era tanks now being unloaded at Yingkou. Although they are better than nothing at all, this is distinctly disappointing."

fengtian.100.d1: "The Fengtian Government has long possessed an advantage against its Chinese rivals thanks to our frequent material aid. In this particular case, we are being asked for light tanks, which are better suited than heavier models to China's rough terrain and primitive infrastructure.\n\nThe latest armored vehicles would be wasted or even outright dangerous in Chinese hands, but we do have surplus stockpiles of only slightly outdated tanks that might be appreciated. Alternately we could send even older equipment at no real cost to ourselves, though of course we could also choose to send nothing at all."

fengtian.104.d: "Word has reached our intelligence operatives that most of our infiltrated soldiers are now in position south of Shanhaiguan. Now they must lie low and await the beginning of the War of National Reclamation."
fengtian.104.a: "Good news."

fengtian.105.t: "Failure at Shanhaiguan"
fengtian.105.d: "Word has reached our intelligence operatives that, in the process of infiltration through Shanhaiguan, our soldiers were discovered and picked off by enemy operatives and groups of military police. If anyone is left, they will undoubtedly be too scattered and disorganised to be of any use once we begin the war, and so unfortunately this plan must be considered failed."
fengtian.105.a: "A brave sacrifice."

fengtian.106.t: "Infiltrators Disappear"
fengtian.106.d: "Although our intelligence services received reports of progress through the beginning stages of the Shanhaiguan Infiltration, contact has been abruptly cut off, and our forces have disappeared South of the Great Wall. It's possible that some were discovered and are merely avoiding detection, or that the entire force was destroyed. The fate of these brave soldiers could never be known."
fengtian.106.a: "There is still hope."

fengtian.107.t: "An Unexpected Advantage"
fengtian.107.d: "Despite the cessation of all contact with the Shanhaiguan infiltration force, reports have made their way north of gunfire and chaos on the northern banks of the Chaobai River. It seems that these heroes have avoided all detection, only to strike now at the opportune moment. Truly, this is an unexpected advantage, and we must push south before they are overwhelmed by the enemy response and greater numbers!"
fengtian.107.a: "Glorious!"

fengtian.108.t: "Shanhaiguan Uprising Fails"
fengtian.108.d: "Before it could ever truly begin, our uprising south of Shanhaiguan was detected and quickly overwhelmed by the local enemy garrison in a short but violent confrontation. While we may encounter some survivors as we push South, we will have no organised assistance from the other side of the Great Wall."
fengtian.108.a: "Damn."

fengtian.110.t: "The Gang of Three"
fengtian.110.d: "As a loose coalition of fallen generals, governors, bureaucrats, and politicians exiled from the South by the collapse of the Beiyang Government, the Recovery League is widely acknowledged to be susceptible to corruption. However, recent discoveries by police have turned up something unusually troubling. It seems that a group of Recovery League politicians, who were made mayors of townships in Jilin, owing to their experience with governing in the South, had in fact never been mayors anywhere or at all. Instead, they had killed and replaced their namesakes and, through a complicated plot of deceit, fooled the authorities while eliminating any who might contradict them.\n\nThe web of lies, corruption, and murder necessary to sustain this falsehood stretches across the whole of the province, and the damage dealt to the government's legitimacy is not inconsiderable."
fengtian.110.a: "Disgusting."

fengtian.111.t: "Mantetsu Bribes"
fengtian.111.d: "A pair of Concordia Association members were recently caught attempting to bribe Recovery League politicians, and while this activity has long been suspected, this is the first time it has been caught in the open. Although members of the other parties have motioned to remove the offending members, the Japanese Consulate has already delivered a message 'strongly advising' that no action be taken against the members of the Concordia Association.\n\nThe Grand Marshal could choose to do so regardless, but not without risking Japanese wrath."
fengtian.111.a: "Remove them anyway."
fengtian.111.b: "We can do nothing."

fengtian.112.t: "The Anshan Incident"
fengtian.112.d: "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as "Anshan Iron and Steel", serving as one of Japan's most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. When the facilities were first constructed most of the ore required little digging, as the deposits lie close to the surface, but as of the current date more extensive excavation is required to continue operations. The company has begun this expansion work without acquiring a lease for the extra land from the local authorities, destroying several farm properties in the process, and despite promises neither compensation, nor the lease have been forthcoming.\n\nProtests quickly broke out among local farmers over the issue, and soon escalated into a riot that severely damaged expensive mining equipment, which our police refused to prevent, citing the technically illegal nature of the operations. On its own initiative, a nearby Japanese garrison from Anshan stepped in, and used lethal force to disperse the riot. This slaughter of our citizens has not gone unnoticed, and existing anti-Japanese sentiment has only been inflamed. The people will hold us accountable in our response, but the deposits and the company working them are essential to Japan's strategic goals, and our relationship with the Japanese permits little room to manoeuvre."
fengtian.112.a: "Denounce the Japanese."
fengtian.112.b: "Stay silent."

fengtian.113.t: "Japan Denounces Us"
fengtian.113.d: "Describing our denouncement of their conduct during the recent Anshan Incident as 'insolent' and 'unbefitting of Japanese generosity', the Japanese government issued a scathing rebuke both publicly and through a letter delivered directly by the Japanese Consul General in Shenyang. The Kwantung Garrison performed a series of motorised and armoured manoeuvres in full view of the capital, their message clear. Any escalation of this situation would undoubtedly result in further rebukes to which we can make no meaningful response."
fengtian.113.a: "So be it."
fengtian.113.b: "We will not be intimidated!"

fengtian.114.t: "An Opportunity Arises"
fengtian.114.d: "In the years since the Fengtian's Army retreat beyond the Great Wall, a watchful eye has been kept on the south. The natural chokepoint created by the Shanhai Pass has always made it hard for Zhili armies to get in, but equally difficult for our own to get out. Any effort to reclaim China has always depended upon a moment of southern weakness. Such a moment now seems set to arrive, as simmering anti-German sentiment has erupted into violence in the League of Eight Provinces, and the governor of Anhui has broken away from Nanjing - hoping to leverage the League and the Central Government against one another for his own gain.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not yet ready to begin our long-awaited campaign, there are outstanding issues in the Northeast to be settled and it is still not clear exactly what will become of the situation in the League. We must watch and wait for the right opportunity."
fengtian.114.a: "Let us choose wisely."

fengtian.115.t: "The Zhang Zuolin Radio Incident"
fengtian.115.d: "In what has come to be known as 'The Zhang Zuolin Radio Incident', a [QIE.GetAdjective] subversive was able to record a frank conversation between the Grand Marshal and his generals, and transmitted it over widely used frequencies in Shenyang for nearly fourty minutes before being jammed by a nearby Mantetsu owned station. The conversation, in which the Grand Marshal described "enemies to the North, South, East, and West", puts Fengtian's relations with Japan in unconventionally blunt terms damaging to our propaganda and Japan's interests.\n\nThe broadcast was doubly damaging thanks to its capture of Zhang discussing the realities of [QIE.GetNameDef]'s relative industrial and military strength, and the degree to which we must rely on the Japanese for crucial technology, something which we have been careful to conceal from the public."
fengtian.115.a: "Like laws, it is better not to see Hongchang being made."

fengtian.116.t: "Seditious Articles Proliferate"
fengtian.116.d: "An article in the Nihon Kogyō Shimbun, or 'Japan Industrial Newspaper', has been translated into Chinese and spread widely in local newspapers before censorship officials managed to track and shut down the publisher. The article described in substantial detail the extensive degree to which Mantetsu and other Japanese companies have established control over most sectors of our economy, and set a forecast predicting near complete control within five years time. For obvious reasons, the article has been deeply upsetting to the general population, and there is little we can do to prevent the existing copies circulating."
fengtian.116.a: "Disgraceful!"

fengtian.117.t: "Honghuzi Attacks in Heilongjiang"
fengtian.117.d: "Honghuzi, translating literally to 'Red Beards', are groups of bandits and robbers that have long plagued the Northeast. While the Grand Marshal's Pacification and Centralisation campaign after the last war reduced their number, there have been attacks in the years since. Now several farmsteads in southern Heilongjiang were set alight, and their occupants robbed of valuables.\n\nSome have suggested that an expedition should be mounted to crush the bandits at their base of operations, but others say that such a mission is beneath the central government and worth little time or effort."
fengtian.117.d_Ma: "Honghuzi, translating literally to 'Red Beards', are groups of bandits and robbers that have long plagued the Northeast.

Minister of Security Ma Zhanshan, longing to get into the field and himself once a bandit, has offered to lead the mission personally."
fengtian.117.a: "An expedition is a fool's errand."
fengtian.117.b: "Send an expedition."
fengtian.117.c: "Ma Zhanshan will lead the expedition personally."

fengtian.118.t: "Honghuzi Attacks in Xing'an"
fengtian.118.d: "Despite efforts made to contain them, the Honghuzi have struck again, this time in Xing'an, raiding farmers and traders along its major roads. The local governor has dispatched his garrison to guard against future incursions, but the rough terrain and the bandit's elusive nature suggests that they may simply strike again elsewhere."
fengtian.118.d_Ma: "Despite Ma's best efforts to hunt them down the Honghuzi have struck again, this time in Xing'an, raiding farmers and traders along its major roads. The local governor has dispatched his garrison to guard against future incursions, but the rough terrain and the bandits' elusive nature suggests that they may simply strike again elsewhere."
fengtian.118.a: "Perhaps the Honghuzi have had enough."
fengtian.118.b: "Hunt them down!"
fengtian.118.c: "Ma will get them this time!"

fengtian.119.t: "Honghuzi Attacks in Liaobei"
fengtian.119.d: "The Honghuzi have grown particularly bold, leading attacks into Liaobei province, and even venturing to the borders of Jilin before derailing a local train and robbing its occupants, including a number of Japanese citizens. The local authorities have apologised profusely for this embarrassment, and additional guards have been posted on nearby trains, but the Japanese Consulate has already demanded compensation from our government for the property lost.\n\nAllowing this to continue for any longer would be a national embarrassment."

fengtian.119.a: "Third time's the charm!"
fengtian.119.b: "Third time's the charm!"

fengtian.120.t: "The Manchurian Youth League"
fengtian.120.d: "The Manchurian Youth League has existed as a general association for Mantetsu employees and other Japanese residents in the Northeast for several years, but the recent attacks by bandits has lead it to issue a statement on the matter, calling on the Japanese Government to better protect its citizens, and demanding a greater degree of control over our government.\n\nOf course, the immediate impact will likely be minimal, but if the Youth League continues its efforts, it could turn some heads in Tokyo."
fengtian.120.a: "Unfortunate."

fengtian.124.t: "Heinous Assassination in Shenyang!"
fengtian.124.d: "On his way to government offices, a member of the Communications Clique was gunned down in public by what appears to be a [QIE.GetAdjective] loyalist, recruited from among the Northeast's Manchu population! [QIE.GetNameDefCap] has been known to recruit spies and assassins before, but some rumours suggest that this assassin was instead hired by members of the Concordia Association, locked in conflict with the Communications Clique's Railway and Telegraph barons for control of the country's infrastructure."
fengtian.124.a: "A terrible loss."

fengtian.125.t: "Record Mantetsu Profits"
fengtian.125.d: "The South Manchuria Railway Company, colloquially 'Mantetsu', has long dominated large sectors of Fengtian's economy, and in turn acts as Japan's primary means of influence over our government. While this influence is unwelcome, it brings crucial capital and technology without which the Grand Marshal could never hope to retake China.\n\nThe Company has today announced record profits, much of which goes to Japan's government in the form of tax revenue."
fengtian.125.a: "Is this a necessary evil?"

fengtian.126.t: "Counterfeit Dollars Spread"
fengtian.126.d: "In order to save money, the version of the Fengtian Dollar being circulated currently is the same as it was when it was first issued, as quality printing equipment is highly expensive. This seems to have left the currency open to forgery, however, and already there are believed to be thousands of fake Fengtian dollars circulating."
fengtian.126.a: "They will be caught eventually."

fengtian.128.t: "Zhang's Proclamation"
fengtian.128.d: "Grand Marshal Zhang of the Fengtian Government has proclaimed that, within a year, his nation will begin its War of National Reclamation to retake the South and reunite the country under his leadership. Of course, our aid has played a great role in getting Fengtian to where it is today, and already some ministers have suggested that we might make a private commitment to joining their war.\n\nThis would be in our interest, as Fengtian is the best means of pushing German influence out of China, but at the same time it might be best to limit their ambitions and our resources are not limitless. The Grand Marshal will, of course, push on regardless. His legitimacy depends on it."
fengtian.128.a: "Support Fengtian."
fengtian.128.b: "Refuse to support Fengtian."

fengtian.129.t: "War Descends from the North"
fengtian.129.d: "Today Grand Marshal Zhang, of the Fengtian Government, has declared that within one year he will begin his 'War of National Reclamation' and strike south against us. Whether or not he has Japan's support, there will be a great struggle ahead, for in the end there can only be one China."
fengtian.129.a: "They shall not pass."

fengtian.130.t: "Japan Confirms its Support"
fengtian.130.d: "Japan's government has privately sent its assurances that it will assist as we strike south!"
fengtian.130.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.131.t: "Honouring Commitments"
fengtian.131.d: "The time has come to honour our word and enter Fengtian's war against [QIE.GetNameDef]."
fengtian.131.a: "Japan honours its commitments."
fengtian.131.b: "Fengtian is on its own."

fengtian.132.t: "The Tiannanmen Parade"
fengtian.132.d: "With the capital secure and under our control, we have achieved the first and perhaps greatest goal on the long road to national reclamation. Soon, the world will no longer be able to ignore our right to be recognised as the sole legitimate government! Unfortunately, our Japanese allies also took part in the fighting around Beijing, and have already begun organising a victory parade through Tiannanmen Square. The local IJA commander has extended an invitation, but with a tardiness that seems all too deliberate, and our troops will have to rush to prepare.\n\nSome of our generals are already suggesting that we prevent the Japanese from holding their parade or organise our own later, as Beijing is ultimately our capital and this is our day of glory. Other more diplomatic members of the Cabinet and Assembly are proposing that we accept the invitation, most prominently members of the Concordia Association."

The local IJA commander has extended an invitation, but with a tardiness that seems all too deliberate, and our troops will have to rush to prepare. The Concordia Association, which has a great deal of influence in our government, makes taking a hard-line stance difficult, though we could probably convince our local commanders to snub the occasion. If this were to occur, the Japanese would almost certainly be enraged."
fengtian.132.a: "This is our day!"
fengtian.132.b: "We will march side by side!"
fengtian.132.c: "We will not participate!"

fengtian.133.t: "Chinese Insolence at Tiannanmen!"
fengtian.133.d: "With China's capital secure we have helped the Fengtian Government achieve the first and perhaps greatest goal on its long road to national reclamation. The local IJA commander who lead the assault on the capital has already begun organising a victory parade, and kindly invited nearby Fengtian divisions to participate. However, in an act of unparalleled impertinence, the Fengtian Government has not only refused our offer but actively impeded our own parade claiming that this is 'their day of glory' and not our own!\n\nWe could issue an immediate statement, cutting aid from Fengtian, but they do remain our allies, and the war continues unabated."
fengtian.133.a: "Punish this insolence immediately!"
fengtian.133.b: "Punishment will have to wait."
fengtian.133.c: "So be it."

fengtian.134.t: "Chinese Insolence at Tiannanmen!"
fengtian.134.d: "With China's capital secure we have helped the Fengtian Government achieve the first and perhaps greatest goal on its long road to national reclamation. The local IJA commander who lead the assault on the capital has already begun organising a victory parade, and kindly invited nearby Fengtian divisions to participate. However, in an act of unparalleled impertinence, the Fengtian Government has refused our offer, and will hold its own separate parade! Surely, our own resplendent troops will make fools of them, but their actions may deserve a more serious response."
fengtian.134.a: "Punish this impertinence immediately!"
fengtian.134.b: "Punishment will have to wait."

fengtian.135.t: "Japan's Delayed Anger"
fengtian.135.d: "In response to our embarrassment of their forces during the occupation of Beijing, the Japanese Government has temporarily cut its various forms of aid to our country. It seems Japanese pride is easily tarnished, and grudges are not soon forgotten."
fengtian.135.a: "Unfortunate."
fengtian.135.b: "We can hold grudges too, expel their military mission!"

fengtian.136.t: "Fengtian in Crisis"
fengtian.136.d: "In spite of all the aid we have provided over the years to the Fengtian Government, it now faces the risk of defeat as its armies begin to crumble. Not only do we have a general commitment to Fengtian's defence politically and economically, but it also remains the only means by which we could indirectly control China as a whole. Direct occupation would almost certainly be costly, but an intervention could also come with its own costs. The time has come to decide."

fengtian.138.t: "The Founding of the Jilin Film Association"
fengtian.138.d: "Bringing together staff from its Photographic Division, directors from Japan, and local acting talent, Mantetsu has begun the process of establishing a film studio in Jilin which it claims will 'Demonstrate what China can achieve with modernity, through the camera lens, in a unique Chinese style'. Privately, Mantetsu's President has indicated that the studio will also be used to subtly spread anti-[QIE.GetAdjective] messages, but this has left some close advisers to the Grand Marshal wondering what else might be subtly inserted.\n\nThe government could always instruct Jilin's governor to deny Mantetsu permission to build, but the Film Association would likely just move south to [GetDalianName], where we will have no influence over it at all."
fengtian.138.a: "Modernity is our goal!"

fengtian.139.d_1: "The Jilin Film Association has today released its first feature, a sweeping ethnographic detailing the diverse populations of the Northeast, from the snow-capped pines of Heilongjiang to the fertile banks of the lower Liao River, espousing the values of the national 'Five Races under One Union' policy.\n\nThanks to government assistance, the Association was able to easily access a number of remote locations in order to film and better spread its message of unity and harmony, though some criticism has been levelled at its coverage of Koreans and Japanese, many of whom also cohabit the Northeast, but are not officially a part of the 'Five Races' designated in the national flag. Overall, and despite its relatively small screening due to limited theatre numbers, the film has been considered a great success."

Still, despite this and its relatively small screening due to limited theatre numbers, the film has been considered a success."

The latest film, 'Song of the White Orchid', has attracted notable attention however.\n\nThe piece involves a romantic entanglement between a Japanese man (Kazuo Hasegawa) and a Chinese woman (Li Xianglan) where Li leaves her lover through a misunderstanding, and joins a Manchu bandit group plotting to sabotage the South Manchuria Railway. She later learns of the deliberate arrangement of this misunderstanding by [QIE.GetAdjective] spies, renews her faith in Hasegawa, and undermines the plot. Both protagonists seem clear allegories for their respective countries, and concerns have been raised, but the anti-[QIE.GetAdjective] propaganda value is significant, and the theme tune is just so catchy..."

The latest film, 'Lice are Frightening', has attracted notable attention however.\n\nThe piece presents a scientific and hygenic lesson to viewers through a combination of microscopy and 'outrageous' stop-motion animated lice which, some have alleged, appear to 'leap from the screen'. Aside from some first-time viewers being scared out of the theatre, the overall message is demeaning, playing to Japanese assumptions that Chinese are, by habit, dirty and lice-infested; the reception being quite negative as a result, and leading some to wonder whether this might have been avoided if the government took a more active role in production."

Foregoing a direct assault, Ma devised an ingenious plan where he and several trusted companions infiltrated the Bandit stronghold and struck from the inside, catching the defenders by surprise and allowing an assault to begin from the base of the mountain. Despite the steep inclines, narrow pathways, and hidden caverns, Tiger Mountain was taken in under an hour.\n\nA number of prisoners from the surrounding villages were subsequently liberated, alongside a significant sum in valuables, and with the day won Ma set light to the Bandit camp; the fire soon spreading to the trees, and creating a spectacle visible for miles around."

fengtian.144.d: "As part of a general inspection of the narrow demilitarised zone separating [QIE.GetAdjective] and Fengtian territory, Prince Kan'in was greeted by a precision military drill at the Wanjiazhen Forts, built in 1929 to support the operation of several armoured trains along the Jingfeng Line. Unfortunately, in the years since, time and poor maintenance have taken their toll. Kotohito was clearly not impressed with what he saw, using his extensive soldierly experience to critique the poor state of our defences.\n\nIn lieu of further inspections, the Prince will be staying at the recently completed Yamato Hotel in Jinzhou, before moving north again to Harbin."

Impressed by the recent additions to the Forts, and other fortifications to the north running parallel to the Great Wall, Kotohito was also surprised by the professionalism of our soldiers. Given our esteemed visitor's considerable rank in the Japanese military, it seems likely that Japan will see us as a more reliable ally in the future.\n\nIn lieu of further inspections, the Prince will be staying at the recently completed Yamato Hotel in Jinzhou, before moving north again to Harbin."

fengtian.145.t: "An Industrial Excursion"
fengtian.145.d: "Before leaving for Harbin, Prince Kan'in surprised his entourage by breaking from the established schedule to examine Jinzhou's burgeoning industry, a direct product of the new Special Industrial Zone there. Intrigued by the growth he had already seen on the train journey through Anshan, Kotohito was even more impressed by the rapid rate of industrialisation present here, commenting that much of the surrounding area had been little more than a bare field during his last visit.\n\nHopefully this experience will leave a lasting positive impression."
fengtian.145.a: "The future is now!"

fengtian.146.t: "The Wonders of Harbin"
fengtian.146.d: "The Northeast's cultural capital and a centre of innovation, the city of Harbin has received Prince Kan'in after his long journey through the summer heat. The Prince quickly transitioned to a tour of the city, including the Russian quarter, and received reports from both Chinese and Japanese garrisons along the Northern frontier.\n\nHis departure from the city in a few days will mark a functional end to the visit, though he remains the nation's guest until his train passes back into the Kwantung Leased Territory."
fengtian.146.d_express: "The Northeast's cultural capital and a centre of innovation, the city of Harbin received Prince Kan'in a mere four an a half hours after his departure thanks to the astounding speed of Mantetsu's 'Asia Express', among the fastest locomotives in the world. Although Kotohito was aware of the train's existence, few things prepare even royalty for the speed and luxury of this world wonder.\n\nThe Prince quickly transitioned to a tour of the city, including the Russian quarter, and received reports from both Chinese and Japanese garrisons along the Northern frontier.

fengtian.147.t: "Prince Kan'in Returns to Japan"
fengtian.147.d: "His duties here complete, Prince Kan'in Kotohito has safely departed [GetDalianName] for the Home Islands. Any strong impressions made could have a lasting impact upon our relations with Japan."
fengtian.147.a: "Hopefully they are positive."

fengtian.148.t: "Prince Kan'in Poisoned"
fengtian.148.d: "After complaining of headaches and diziness following the state dinner, Prince Kan'in collapsed just outside his room in the Grand Marshal's estate. Thanks to the medical attention provided by a nearby Mantetsu-owned hospital, he seems set to make a full recovery. However, blood tests leave little doubt that this was an attempt on his life.\n\nThe lapse in security responsible, and the event in itself, represent a deep national embarrassment and a grave insult to Japan's Imperial family. Severe repercussions are distinctly possible."
fengtian.148.a: "How could this happen?"

fengtian.149.t: "Prince Kan'in is Shot!"
fengtian.149.d: "During his inspection of an outpost north of the Shanhai Pass, a renegade soldier suddenly opened fire on Prince Kan'in, killing several of his guards before being overwhelmed. Fortunately, the Prince suffered relatively minor injuries, but the lapse in security responsible, and the event in itself, represent a deep national embarrassment and a grave insult to Japan's Imperial family.\n\nInvestigative work so far seems to suggest that the soldier was part of an extremist faction within the Zhang Clique, and Japan's response could be severe."
fengtian.149.a: "How could this happen?"

fengtian.150.t: "The Prince's Train is bombed!"
fengtian.150.d: "Only minutes after leaving Huanggutun station in Shenyang, the Prince's train was rocked by a massive explosion, obliterating its rear carriages. Fortunately, a last minute change resulted in his carriage being moved to the front of the train, allowing him to escape with only minor injuries. The lapse in security responsible, and the event in itself, represent a deep national embarrassment and a grave insult to Japan's Imperial family.\n\nInvestigative work so far seems to suggest that lower ranking members of the Communications Clique might be responsible, and Japan's response could be severe."
fengtian.150.a: "How could this happen?"

fengtian.151.t: "The Bastion in the North"
fengtian.151.d: "As the year 1936 dawns, Fengtian stands in the Northeast as the final bastion of China's Republican dream. As with many things in China however, the abstractions of this dream hide complex and often inconvenient truths. The Fengtian Government of the Republic of China, contesting [QIE.GetNameDef]'s claims to legitimacy, maintains democracy only as a thin veneer, covering what has always been, and perhaps always will be, an authoritarian state.\n\nThe Assembly in Shenyang is widely regarded to be corrupt, power divided between autocratic generals, unscrupulous railway barons, and Pan-Asianist ideologues with questionable motivations. Amid it all stands Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, his ambitions great, but limited by the stark realities of [QIE.GetAdjective] strength and Japanese power; for now forced to walk a political tightrope between the two, and above the machinations of his own divided government. The status quo cannot last forever, and if the right moment to strike south is not chosen soon, it may never come at all.\n\nThe staggering cost of the wars with the south and the severance of economic ties left Fengtian reeling, and while past years have been spent rebuilding, there is much left to do. Likewise, the army has suffered from neglect, and must be reorganised. The Japanese, their influence growing by the day, present both a dire threat and an opportunity. The waters ahead are treacherous, and it will take a truly great helmsman to steer the ship of state not only to survival, but also toward the reclamation of all China.\n\nBriefings are available on Fengtian's special mechanics, its relationship with the Japanese, and internal politics."

fengtian.151.b: "Brief me on the Japanese."
fengtian.151.c: "Brief me on Politics."
fengtian.151.e: "Onward!"

fengtian.152.t: "Special Mechanics Briefing"
fengtian.152.d: "The Fengtian Government is unstable, pressured from without and within, ultimately a fusion of elements that would be contradictory were it not for their shared goals. The parties, more accurately termed factions, exercise their grip through dominance of the country's institutions instead of mass appeal. As such, the 'popularity' of parties should be taken to represent their degree of control over the country's government and other structures of power, control being determined not by the popular policies of ministers, but by choices, focuses, and events that increase or diminish their power.\n\nConsequently, your aim should be to balance the various factions, each of which has the potential to abuse their power if given too much of it, though each will do so differently. As they grow in strength, the factions will nominate ministers, each of whom will pursue their own agenda, potentially in line with their faction, or their country, but which could also have negative consequences in the short or long term.\n\nAnother crucial point is the role of the Concordia Association, also explained in the politics briefing, the strength of which can be taken as a loose indicator of Japanese influence over the country. As their influence grows, it will lead to increasing bonuses to production, but at the cost of political power and autonomy. The rise of this influence is inevitable over time, and should be viewed with caution."
fengtian.152.a: "Brief me on the Japanese."
fengtian.152.b: "Brief me on Politics."
fengtian.152.c: "Onward!"

fengtian.153.t: "Japanese Briefing"
fengtian.153.d: "The Japanese exercise their power in Fengtian through a series of treaties permitting them not only extraterritoriality, but also the right to live and work in Fengtian more or less as if they were its citizens. While the Grand Marshal and others utilise a wide variety of means to slow and inconvenience the Japanese, their presence is necessary and the growth of their influence inevitable. The primary institution responsible for this growth is the South Manchuria Railway Company, more commonly termed 'Mantetsu', the profits from which in recent years have accounted for nearly a quarter of Japan's entire national budget.\n\nAt the same time, the Japanese need Fengtian and what it represents. Its cooperation and the prospect of a victory in the South offer to save Japan a great deal of time and money. The result is a tenuous balance, the Japanese ever looking for more profit and power, but well aware that pushing too hard will place Zhang Zuolin in a politically untenable position, and thus bring their careful efforts to naught.\n\nSo far Zhang has pursued a patchwork policy; promotion of Pan-Asian brotherhood with Japan, only to intermittently replace this with repudiations of Japanese initiatives that push too far, and consistent private efforts to lessen Japanese influence. How to proceed will be your choice, but caution is advised."
fengtian.153.a: "Brief me on Politics."
fengtian.153.b: "Brief me on the Special Mechanics."
fengtian.153.c: "Onward!"

fengtian.154.t: "Politics Briefing"
fengtian.154.d: "Fengtian has four primary political factions:\n\n1. The Recovery League\n\nA loose association of fallen generals, governors, bureaucrats, and politicians without any strong ideological affiliation, most of whom find themselves in Fengtian because there are few other places where they might hold any semblance of power. Easily bribed and tempted, they often serve to promote the interests of whoever is willing to pay, and consequently the 'league' is highly splintered despite controlling a large portion of the Assembly, lacking the political will to act decisively.\n\n2. The Zhang Clique\n\nA collection of loyalists and generals, the Zhang Clique holds no specific ideology beyond promoting the furtherance of the Grand Marshal's political powers. While making pretences to democracy, Zhang's supporters are not committed to republican ideals, and promote them only for their utility.\n\n3. The Communications Clique\n\nThe sole politically coherent faction to emerge from the former Beiyang Government, the Communications Clique are a collection of railroad and telegraph barons, primarily self-interested, but locked in confrontation with Mantetsu and the Concordia Association over the country's infrastructure.\n\n4. The Concordia Association\n\nA grouping of politicians and lobbyists with all the trappings of a party, the Concordia Association represents the interests of Mantetsu, and sometimes other Japanese Zaibatsu, in the Assembly. Their actual ideological positions vary, some using the Japanese to counter Zhang's power for their own gain, with others subscribing to Pan-Asian principles."

fengtian.154.b: "Brief me on the Japanese."
fengtian.154.c: "Onward!"

fengtian.158.t: "Tang Yulin Tempts Fate"
fengtian.158.d: "Promised control of Chahar Province only to have it torn away by Mongolian rebels in the last days of the Zhifeng War, Tang Yulin's ambitions to retake the province have never been a secret affair. However, few would have predicted a move such as this; a daring series of raids into Mongolian territory, striking the trading centre of Duolun, and eliciting a fierce response from the local Xilingol League. Skirmishes have erupted all along the Jehol-Chahar border, and neither side seems willing to give ground.\n\nStrangely word has reached the government's ears only now, after nearly a day of fighting, and it seems Tang may have abused his office in order to further escalate the conflict. This is assuming, of course, that the Mongolians have not already decided to commit themselves fully."
fengtian.158.a: "We must strike before they do!"
fengtian.158.b: "Tang has done enough damage already!"
fengtian.158.c: "Maybe things will de-escalate."

fengtian.159.t: "Fengtian Invades Chahar"
fengtian.159.d: "It has never been a secret that Fengtian wanted to reclaim Chahar province, which we brazenly stole from under its nose in the last days of the last Chinese civil war, but few expected a sudden invasion, especially without preparatory troop movements for weeks beforehand. Some are even saying that it may be only a matter of time before the Fengtian Government pushes to reclaim all of Inner Mongolia.\n\nWar has come to our doorstep."
fengtian.159.a: "Right where we like it!"
fengtian.159.b: "Let them have the land!"

fengtian.160.t: "Confusion at the Border"
fengtian.160.d: "Scattered reports suggest that the Fengtian Government has carried out a surprise attack on the trading centre of Duolun in Chahar province, eliciting a fierce response from the local Xilingol League. Skirmishes have erupted all along the Jehol-Chahar border, and neither side seems willing to give ground, but strangely the Fengtian Government itself claims that the attack was been carried out by a rogue general who will shortly be removed from office. Whether this is true or the start of something larger is unclear, but if what they say is true it might be worth striking while they are confused and disorganised."
fengtian.160.a: "This isn't worth a war."
fengtian.160.b: "They've messed with the wrong Khan!"

fengtian.161.t: "Border Skirmishes in Chahar"
fengtian.161.d: "Scattered reports suggest that Fengtian troops have carried out a surprise attack on the trading centre of Duolun in Chahar province, eliciting a fierce response from the local Xilingol League. Skirmishes have erupted all along the Jehol-Chahar border, and neither side seems willing to give ground, but strangely Fengtian reinforcements haven't arrived and the fighting is so far contained to the two provinces. Whether this is merely a rogue general or the start of something larger is unclear, but in either case it might be worth striking while they are disorganised."
fengtian.161.a: "This isn't worth a war."
fengtian.161.b: "They've messed with the wrong Khan!"

fengtian.162.t: "Fengtian Skirmishes with Mongolia"
fengtian.162.d: "A developing crisis has emerged on the Fengtian-Mongolian border, with localised fighting now ongoing for two days between forces of the Provincial Governor of Jehol and the Mongolian Xilingol League. For unclear reasons the central government in Shenyang has yet to react to the Crisis, possibly hoping to squeeze out a victory without a larger costly war.\n\nOfficials at home and at the Kwantung Army headquarters in [GetDalianName] have reacted with alarm, worried that this could set a precedent for further irresponsible actions that might draw us into a wider conflict, while the foreign ministry suggests silent support; unwilling to risk harming the reputation of the pro-Japanese Concordia Association in the Fengtian Government."
fengtian.162.a: "They will have our support."
fengtian.162.b: "They will fight only when we say so!"

fengtian.165.t: "Japan Offers Support"
fengtian.165.d: "In light of the ongoing situation on the Mongolian Border, Japan has decided to render political and material aid."
fengtian.165.a: "Excellent!"

fengtian.166.t: "Japan Lashes Out!"
fengtian.166.d: "Condemning what they call 'dangerous and disrepsectful irresponsibility damaging to our partnership', the Japanese consulate in Mukden has forwarded word that they will be temporarily ending various aid programs."
fengtian.166.a: "Unfortunate."

fengtian.167.t: "Ma Zhanshan Offers to Defect!"
fengtian.167.d: "Communicating by mounted messenger, General Ma Zhanshan of [From.GetNameDef] has offered to defect, citing his once close relationship with Zhang Zuolin, but his growing dissatisfaction with the Grand Marshal's political overreach. Zhanshan is known to be an effective, if eccentric general, spending much of his time practicing his superb marksmanship; likely a product of the early life he spent roaming the Northeastern plain.\n\nAll the former bandit asks for in return is the latest equipment to outfit his men and three million dollars worth of gold."
fengtian.167.a: "A small price to pay for a skilled general."
fengtian.167.b: "Defectors? We don't need these scum!"

fengtian.168.t: "Ma Zhanshan has defected to [From.GetNameDef]!"
fengtian.168.d: "For reasons unknown, Ma Zhanshan suddenly defected to [From.GetNameDef], bringing with him ten thousand men, and receiving in return three million dollars' worth of gold. Ma has long had a close relationship with the Grand Marshal, so this move comes as a stunning surprise, though already some of his former rivals are attributing the action to his early life as a bandit."
fengtian.168.a: "There are no words..."

fengtian.169.t: "Ma Zhanshan has Double-Crossed us!"
fengtian.169.d: "General Ma Zhanshan, who only recently defected to our ranks after accepting an enormous bribe, has double-crossed us and returned to fight for [FNG.GetNameDef]; taking the weapons and gold he gave us with him!"

Ma is already being hailed as a hero, and newspapers from [GetDalianName] to Harbin are portraying suspiciously varying 'first-hand accounts' of his fearless break through [From.GetAdjective] lines."
fengtian.171.d_ma_dead: "General Ma Zhanshan, who only recently defected to [From.GetNameDef], staged a daring betrayal and attempted to return return to our own ranks yesterday, nearly bringing with him a cache of weapons and over three million dollars worth of gold originally used to 'buy' his loyalty. Unfortunately, [QIE.GetAdjective] forces were quick to cut-off and surround Ma's troops, resulting in a vicious battle that left the ambitious general dead. Still, he is already being immortalised as a hero, and newspapers from [GetDalianName] to Harbin are portraying suspiciously varying 'first-hand accounts' of his fearless attempt break through [From.GetAdjective] lines, and his fall to overwhelming numbers."

fengtian.173.d: "For the first time, Mantetsu's 'Asia Express' streamlined train will be running from the tip of [GetDalianName] to the northern city of Harbin, at an astonishing 130 kilometres an hour, putting it among the fastest trains in the world. The journey took a mere 21 hours and 30 minutes. The locomotive wonder bears cars outfitted with heat, air conditioning, and luxurious lounges for even third class customers, as well as its very own signature cocktail served at the bar.\n\nWhile Mantetsu's unimitigated success has given some reason to cheer, and may strike envy in Beijing, others can only view Mantetsu's advancements with growing concern."
fengtian.173.a: "A modern marvel!"

fengtian.174.t: "Lu Ronghuan gifts a Sturdy Northeastern Pony"
fengtian.174.d: "For reasons probably associated with his recent ministerial appointment, Lu Ronghuan has gifted the Grand Marshal a splendid Manchurian pony named 'Pong', a rare breed supposedly capable of performing tricks, and worth nearly a million Yen. Exchanges of gifts, which might be interpreted as bribes in other countries, are a common sight in the Northeast and across China, but Lu's deep pockets are known for producing all manner of expensive oddities."

fengtian.175.d_Li: "Influential members of the Concordia Association had planned to bring forward legislation tomorrow increasing their control over the country's telegraph, claiming that certain sections in Jilin Province were built without permits, and calling that they be turned over to 'more reliable authorities'. However, the major lines running from [GetDalianName] to Harbin have suddenly experienced a series of strikes, shutting down service in protest of the proposed legislation.\n\nFaced with this overwhelming rejection, the legislation has been shelved for the timebeing, and it seems likely that Li Shaogeng and his widespread contacts are responsible."
fengtian.175.d_Liang: "As of early this morning the major railway lines running between [GetDalianName], Shenyang, and Harbin have experienced near total shutdowns as strikes seemingly spontaneously erupted along them, effectively grinding the country's resource economy to a halt.\n\nMantetsu and its advocates in the Concordia Association seem to have taken the opportunity to ship in workers from the Kwantung Leased Territory to ensure that basic services continue to run, but the strike has continued nontheless; demonstrating Liang Shiyi's willingness to damage even his own cause in response to refusal by the Grand Marshal."

fengtian.176.d: "Despite the immeasurable faith put in Pan Fu by awarding him and his party with the right to direct Fengtian's financial and monetary development in accordance with Wang Yongjiang's original policies, his efforts seem to have fallen short. Evidence has come to the Grand Marshal's attention suggesting that vast sums of development money were funnelled into private projects and accounts across the country. No doubt other members of his party are complicit, and while some measure of corruption is of little surprise to the public, a scandal on this scale will upset even the highest ranks of government."

fengtian.177.d: "Despite the immeasurable faith put in Li Shaogeng by awarding him and his party with the right to direct Fengtian's financial and monetary development in accordance with Wang Yongjiang's original policies, his efforts seem to have fallen short. Evidence has come to the Grand Marshal's attention suggesting that vast sums of development money were funnelled into desperate measures to compete with Mantetsu across the country, a vast majority in the form of bribes. On top of this, Li has abused his position to ensure favourable rights for construction efforts lead by his allies in government. No doubt other members of his party are complicit, and while some measure of corruption is of little surprise to the public, a scandal on this scale will upset even the highest ranks of government."

fengtian.178.d: "Despite the immeasurable faith put in Sun Qichang by awarding him and his party with the right to direct Fengtian's financial and monetary development in accordance with Wang Yongjiang's original policies, his efforts seem to have fallen short. Evidence has come to the Grand Marshal's attention suggesting that vast sums of development money were funnelled into arms purchases to equip provincial divisions and bodyguards, as well as into the pockets of prominent generals. No doubt other members of his party are complicit, and while some measure of corruption is of little surprise to the public, a scandal on this scale will upset even the highest ranks of government."

Evidence has come to the Grand Marshal's attention suggesting that vast sums of development money were funnelled into Mantetsu sponsored schools and hospitals, each of which used the sudden boost in funding to further its efforts in promoting Sino-Japanese friendship.

fengtian.180.d: "Minister Tang Yulin has been spotted audaciously seated atop a ravenous tiger somewhere in Jehol Province! Or has he?\n\nAn image depicting Tang has circulated widely, appearing in newspapers across the Northeast, though its origin is unclear. Some claim that the image is doctored, while others believe the tiger is only stuffed, but the aspect garnering the most attention is the context. Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin is often referred to as 'The Mukden Tiger', and so the fact that Tang is shown riding one paints a very questionable picture.\n\nOn his part, Tang Yulin claims that the image is the creation of a [QIE.GetAdjective] saboteur, but his extravegant parties in Chaoyang suggests that the image, if not the tiger, may well be genuine."

fengtian.181.t: "The CER Tax Dispute"
fengtian.181.d: "The levying of seemingly arbitrary taxes to fill gaps in the budget, genuine or not, has been a long standing practice of national, regional, and local governments across China, including our own. This time, Interior Minister Yuan is pressuring the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway and Economic Minister, Li Shaogeng, to levy additional taxes on the railway for the purposes of further strengthening the army; threatening an investigation of Communications Clique assets, as well as various fees the Board already charges its customers, the revenue from which almost certainly sticks to a number of fingers.\n\nThere is every likelyhood that, as Yuan is a member of the CER board himself, this is a power-play on his part to weaken his rivals, but such a tax would undoubtedly help fill the national treasury, if at the cost of undercutting competition to Mantetsu. It seems likely that the Grand Marshal will be forced to settle this dispute, lest it spiral out of control."
fengtian.181.a: "Levy the tax."
fengtian.181.b: "No tax is necessary."

fengtian.182.t: "Yuan Investigates Regardless"
fengtian.182.d: "Seething over the decision to prevent his rail-tax proposal, Minister Yuan Jinkai has gone ahead with his threat to intensively investigate the other members of the CER Board, as well as the Communications Clique at large. Already police forces have begun to converge, and unless the Grand Marshal intercedes soon, there is an increasing risk that the investigation could uncover larger secrets best kept from the public eye.\n\nOf course, if his investigation is stopped, Yuan will almost certainly resign his position as Minister of the Interior."
fengtian.182.a: "This will not be tolerated."

fengtian.183.d_large: "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government, and the subject of those fears has now come to pass. Though the Communications Clique has been hit hardest by this scandal, the government as a whole has suffered a serious blow to its legitimacy, despite Yuan's best efforts to keep the full results under wraps. Though there have been calls for Yuan to resign, damage control takes priority, and the Interior Minister has earned a great deal of respect from the general population, ironic though it may be."
fengtian.183.d_small: "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government, but fortunately its results squarely target members of the Communications Clique, leaving the government largely unscathed. Yuan will almost certainly walk away with a greater degree of control over the CER, and greater respect among the general population, despite his own 'alleged' shady dealings."
fengtian.183.a: "At least it's finished."

fengtian.184.t: "Yuan's Investigation Yields Nothing"
fengtian.184.d: "Despite the widespread belief that Yuan's investigation would inevitably uncover some trace of Communications Clique corruption, the official report released today indicates that nothing was found. Yuan is deeply displeased, but there is little he can do short of escalating the conflict in a way guaranteed to do considerable damage to his own reputation."

Not only do we have a general commitment to Fengtian's defence politically and economically, but it also remains the only means by which we could indirectly control China as a whole. Direct occupation would almost certainly be costly, but an intervention could also come with its own risks. The time has come to decide."

fengtian.193.t.yuehan: "Reclaiming the Yuehan Railway"
fengtian.193.d.jinhan: "Originally financed by Belgian capital, the Jinghan Railway runs north-to-south from Beijing in Zhili to Hankou in Hubei. For decades it has served as one of China's primary transit arteries, ferrying goods across the length of the North China Plain, and connecting its width by way of Zhengzhou.\n\nIn the years since its construction the railway has fallen on hard times, and so while the Belgians are long gone it will take a great deal of investment to restore its infrastructure and integrate it with our new national railway services. Of course, we could always ask Mantetsu to do it free of charge."
fengtian.193.d.jinpu: "Financed by British and German capital nearly fifteen years before the Weltkrieg, the Jinpu Railway runs north-to-south from Tianjin to Pukou, a district of Nanjing. Like the Jinghan Railway, it has long served as one of China's most important logistical arteries, connecting north with south, and east with west by way of Xuzhou.\n\nIn the years since the last Zhifeng War the sections of the railway in Shandong and Jiangsu gradually fell under the sway of the German AOG, which updated and expanded its infrastructure. However, as the company's employees have now been driven away or shot as Hanjian they will need to be replaced. Unfortunately the process of finding and paying these individuals, not to mention re-integrating the railway itself, could prove a costly enterprise. Of course, we could always ask Mantetsu to do it free of charge."
fengtian.193.d.yuehan: "The Yuehan Railway, connecting Hankou and Guangdong, was born amid a conflict between Belgian and American investors, and as such took abnormally long to complete once both parties pulled out of the project. The railway was ultimately completed under the supervision of the German AOG in the early 1930s, and remained under their control until the collapse of Sun Chuanfang's League.\n\nWith the Germans gone it will need entirely new management and integration into the new national railway system. This will be an expensive task, though we could always ask Mantetsu to do it for us."
fengtian.193.a: "Give it to Mantetsu."
fengtian.193.b: "We shall control it ourselves."

Their expertise should prove crucial to keeping the trains running on time, despite the political costs of surrendering Chinese railways to foreign control."
fengtian.194.d.jinhan_national: "After a great deal of effort a team of bureaucrats and engineers has been assembled to take control of the Jinghan Railway. A number of the staff had to be pulled out of retirement, while others possessed dubious graduation certificates, but nontheless the trains are thus far running on time."
fengtian.194.d.jinpu_national: "A team of bureaucrats and engineers has finally been assembled to take control of the Jinpu Railway. Many of the fresh-faced staff, some of whom were trained only recently, seemed nervous at the occasion. Nontheless, the reclamation of this once foreign-owned railway is a major step forward in reasserting China's national pride."
fengtian.194.d.yuehan_national: "A team of bureaucrats and engineers has finally assembled at the Yuehan Railway's headquarters in Guangzhou, and though the sign at the entrance is in Chinese, the logbooks and other documents within remain largely German. Converting all of this information will be yet another task to tackle, and finding German-speaking engineers without a history of collaboration was difficult.\n\nNontheless, this marks a significant propaganda victory."
fengtian.194.a: "Excellent."

fengtian.195.t: "The Mantetsu Rail System"
fengtian.195.d: "With Mantetsu's staff taking up residence in the latest 'reclaimed' railway headquarters, the company has decided to establish two regional subsidiaries to supervise activities in North and Central China. The North China Transportation Company, headquartered in Beijing, will take control of operations between Shanhaiguan and the Yangtze, while the Central China Transportation Company will operate between there and Guangzhou in the south. Ironically, the Japanese have now achieved what the German AOG never could."
fengtian.195.a: "A marvel of engineering."

fengtian.196.t: "National Ownership over Railways"
fengtian.196.d: "The central government has finally completed its mission to remove Western influence over our railway system, a very costly project but a great propaganda victory, as Western ownership of Chinese railways has long been seen as the height of national humiliation. In the long term, these efforts will give the government an increase in revenue, and should make further infrastructure expansions cheaper."
fengtian.196.a: "Another victory for China against the West!"

fengtian.197.t: "An Interesting Discovery!"
fengtian.197.d_Wu: "Our agents operating in the Legation Cities have made a surprising discovery in Shanghai's Palace Hotel, which recently paid host to a Fengtian Government delegation led by its Foreign Minister Wu Jinglian. The high-level codebook, found by hotel cleaners, provides a comprehensive look at Fengtian's decryption methods, and provides full access to their encrypted communications. This will prove a treasure trove for our spies, both at home and elsewhere.\n\nThe Fengtian Government will eventually change its codes, but for now the advantage is ours."
fengtian.197.d_Tang: "Our agents operating in the Legation Cities have made a surprising discovery in Tianjin, specifically a Fengtian Government codebook purchased from the local Green Gang. Apparently the criminals received the book from a courtesan making her way from Chengde, where Fengtian's notoriously extravegant Interior Minister Tang Yulin is known to have held a lavish party. Though it may take a few days to confirm that the book is legitimate, it nontheless offers a comprehensive look at Fengtian's decryption methods, and provides full access to their encrypted communications. This will prove a treasure trove for our spies, both at home and elsewhere.\n\nThe Fengtian Government will eventually change its codes, but for now the advantage is ours."
fengtian.197.d_Ruan: "Our agents operating in Tokyo have made a surprising discovery at an izakaya in Nihonbashi. A code-book seems to have been left in a back-room rented out by Ruan Zhenduo, Fengtian's Foreign Minister, and his entourage. Though it may take a few days to confirm that the book is legitimate, it nontheless offers a comprehensive look at Fengtian's decryption methods, and provides full access to their encrypted communications. This will prove a treasure trove for our spies, both at home and elsewhere.\n\nThe Fengtian Government will eventually change its codes, but for now the advantage is ours."
fengtian.197.d_JAPwu: "Our agents operating in the Legation Cities have made a surprising discovery in Shanghai's Palace Hotel, which recently paid host to a Fengtian Government delegation led by its Foreign Minister Wu Jinglian. The high-level codebook, originally pocketed by hotel cleaners, found its way into the hands of German Abteilung III agents, who were summarily relieved of their burden by our own brave operatives. Though it may take a few days to confirm that the book is legitimate, it nontheless offers an even more comprehensive look into Fengtian's communications than we already possess.\n\nAs Fengtian's 'fraternal ally' we ought to return the book, even if it serves only to demonstrate our superiority, but we could also choose to keep it."
fengtian.197.d_JAPtang: "Our agents operating in the Legation Cities have made a surprising discovery in Tianjin, specifically a Fengtian Government codebook 'acquired' from the local Green Gang. The thugs apparently intended to sell the book to the highest bidder, but fortunately our brave operatives simply seized it by force. After some investigation it was discovered that the code book made its way onto the black market by way of a lavish party at Chengde, hosted by Fengtian's Interior Minister Tang Yulin. It is almost certainly genuine, and offers an even more comprehensive look into Fengtian's communications than we already possess.\n\nAs Fengtian's 'fraternal ally' we ought to return the book, even if it serves only to demonstrate our superiority, but we could also choose to keep it."
fengtian.197.d_JAPruan: "The Tokyo Metropolitan Police have made an interesting discovery at a Nihonbashi izakaya, where Fengtian's foreign Minister and his entourage recently rented out a back room.

A codebook seems to have been left under the table, and though it may take a few days to confirm that the code book is genuine, this offers an event more comprehensive look into Fengtian's communications than we already possess.\n\nUnfortunately the book's absence seems to have been noticed, this made evident by Ruan's removal from office. As a high-ranking member of the Concordia Association, his dismissal is an insult to our efforts to support the Fengtian Government and develop the Manchurian region. Already both the Kwantung Army in Shenyang and the Foreign Ministry here in Tokyo are demanding a response.\n\nWe could choose to be polite, or ignore decorum entirely."

fengtian.198.t: "Japan Returns Our Code Book"
fengtian.198.d: "It seems that Japan has recovered the code book recently lost by our bungling minister; Mantetsu's president, Yousuke Matsuoka, handed it over to the Grand Marshal personally this morning. In private, Zhang is reported to have made light of the situation, referring to Matsuoka as his 'loyal dog returning a thrown ball'.\n\nThere is every reason to believe the Japanese have made copies of our top secret codes, and the Concordia Association will undoubtedly play this to their advantage. Still, things could have been worse."

fengtian.199.t: "Japan Demands Ruan Zhenduo's Reinstatement"
fengtian.199.d: "Calling our former Foreign Minister's removal 'unacceptable' and angrily waving the code-book 'lost' in Tokyo, a Japanese diplomat has demanded Ruan Zhenduo's immediate reinstatement. There can be little doubt that the Japanese have already copied our top-secret codes, and the 'story' provided to explain their 'discovery' in a Nihonbashi izakaya seems unlikely.\n\nStill, Japan is not to be trifled with, and the diplomat's anger is no doubt mirrored in Tokyo. We should take our next step carefully."

So now our generals have come up with two other strategies that do not involve us investing heavily in Anqing immediately. The first is simply delaying our plans for the Reclamation War for at least one and a half years, to give Anqing time to recover on their own. The reasoning behind this is that the advantage that Anqing gives us is so great that we must not waste it by going to war while they are weak. The risk is that the Beijing government is able to mount a proper defense before that time. The other option is to not wait for Anqing to recover, but attack as soon as we are able to. The risk is that the Anqing government might collapse, but [QIE.GetNameDef] is still reeling from the effects of the League War and are also weak. We have been mostly insulated from the conflict. However, we cannot risk to athe latter option they should agree as well."

Zhang seeks to enter the conflict as well, but most likely not be satisfied if he is left with nothing, which is bound to happen if Chen insists on controlling all of the Five Provinces.

fengtian.217.d3: "Zhang Zongchang has arrived in Shenyang to settle his territorial dispute with Chen Tiaoyuan. Though neither have made threats to our knowledge, certainly Zhang and Chen are capable of drawing first blood if Zhang Zuolin cannot resolve the border. Long hours of negotation with Zhang Zongchang reveals his conclusion that Chen Tiaoyuan and Anqing are now liabilities. Despite the amount of resources poured into Anqing, it it apparent from the talk that Zhang Zongchang believes the turn commanders in Anqing are too dangerous to ever work for the greater good of China. Zhang Zongchang insists to us that he should keep all our new territory."
fengtian.217.a: "Noted."

fengtian.218.t: "Making a Proposal"
fengtian.218.desc: "Zhang Zuolin has taken in the two prevailing ideas of Chen Tiaoyuan and Zhang Zongchang into care. The fears of Zhang and Chen's rivalry was confirmed in these talks, but a surprising amount of trust was conferred to Zhang Zuolin. One could not properly predict either mens' responses, so there is no guarentee Zhang and Chen will agree to Zuolin's decision. Although made in confidence, the weight of keeping the alliance alive and the and the possiblity of Japan's judgement weighs heavy. After much deliberation, Zhang Zuolin has decided that, with regards to Shandong..."
fengtian.218.a: "Shandong stays in Shandong"
fengtian.218.b: "Shandong keeps Jiangsu"

fengtian.219.t: "Fengtian Presents Proposal to Anqing" #ANQ
fengtian.219.d1: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Chen Tiaoyuan. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong must cede all territory outside of Shandong. To most of Chen's military staff, this is a diplomatic victory. However, a few officers feel that a rabid dog such as Zhang Zongchang should not be allowed to remain in power at all."
fengtian.219.d2: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Chen Tiaoyuan. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong may continue to occupy Jiangsu. To most of Chen's military staff, this is a diplomatic defeat, and legitimizes the tyranny of Zhang Zongchang. However, we know this is only temporary and our most important focus right now is to defeat the Kuomintang. We should probably accept for now if we do not wish to fight a two-front war."
fengtian.219.d3: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Chen Tiaoyuan. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong should be awarded Jiangsu province to appease him, at least temporarily. To most of Chen's military staff, this is a diplomatic defeat, and legitimizes the tyranny of Zhang Zongchang. However, we know that after the Kuomintang are dealt with, we can focus all our attention on regaining Jiangsu, so maybe we should agree with this for now."
fengtian.219.d4: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Chen Tiaoyuan. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong may continue to occupy all their territory they took from the League of Eight Provinces. This would be a massive diplomatic defeat and it shows a significant failing on the part of Zhang Zuolin. We cannot accept this."
fengtian.219.a: "Accept"
fengtian.219.b: "Refuse"

fengtian.220.t: "Fengtian Presents Proposal to Shandong" #SQI
fengtian.220.d1: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Zhang Zongchang. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong must cede all territory outside of Shandong. To Zhang Zongchang's military staff, this is a significant defeat, as we rightfully took this territory from the former League of Eight Provinces, which no longer exists. Chen Tiaoyuan has no right that we lack to this land."
fengtian.220.d2: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Zhang Zongchang. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong may continue to occupy Jiangsu Province (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong States). This would be at least a temporary victory, as it will improve our chances of holding on to Jiangsu. However, we should be careful, as Anqing may seek to regain full control once they have dealt with the Kuomintang in the south."
fengtian.220.d3: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Zhang Zongchang. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong be awarded Jiangsu Province (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong States). To most of Zhang Zongchang's military staff, this is a diplomatic victory. Anqing will not like this, so it is possible they might hold a grudge and move against us as soon as they have dealt with the Kuomintang. We should be very careful."
fengtian.220.d4: "Zhang Zuolin has delivered his decision to Zhang Zongchang. On the issue of the Anqing-Shandong border, Zhang Zuolin has declared that Shandong be awarded Jiangsu Province (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong States). We are also allowed to keep the rest of the territory we acquired from the League of Eight Provinces. This is a major victory, but Anqing will surely not accept this. However, it will give us a solid strategic position, aiding us in a potential conflict." 
fengtian.220.a: "Accept"
fengtian.220.b: "Refuse"

fengtian.221.t: "Zhang Zuolin's Proposal Accepted" 
fengtian.221.d: "Fengtian's proposal has been accepted by both Zhang Zongchang and Chen Tiaoyuan. Perhaps this is the beginning of a new era of cooperation under Fengtian that will lead to national reunification? Many in the military staff are hopeful, citing this as a triumph not even Wu Peifu could accomplish."
fengtian.221.a: "Peace... for now."

fengtian.222.t: "Zhang Zuolin's Proposal Rejected" 
fengtian.222.d: "Fengtian's proposal has been rejected by both Zhang Zongchang and Chen Tiaoyuan. It seems the two will remain uncooperative and hostile for the forseeable future. Perhaps this is a signal that diplomatic negotations to reunify China are doomed to fail? Some within the military staff agree, citing that not even Wu Peifu could have figured out a diplomatic solution."
fengtian.222.a: "Unfortunate, but unsurprising."

fengtian.223.t: "Shandong and Anqing Make Deal" 
fengtian.223.d: "After our failure to engineer a temporary peace between our allies, Shandong and Anqing, we have received word from Anqing and Shandong diplomats that they have brokered their own temporary peace, as they were dissatisfied with our efforts. Apparently, a lowly diplomat went out on a limb and proposed a deal, fully of his own accord. While that brave man did a good deed and has created a peace in our favor, it does highlight our own incompetence."
fengtian.223.a: "Surprising."

fengtian.224.t: "Shandong and Anqing Declare War" 
fengtian.224.d: "We're not sure exactly what happened, but it looks like talks between Shandong and Anqing broke down somehow. The personalities of Zhang Zongchang and Chen Tiaoyuan were obvious factors in this breakdown. Anqing and Shandong, despite both of them being in favor of a Fengtian victory, appear to be ready to deploy troops against each other. The military staff is divided, with some in favor of protecting our old investments in Shandong via Zhang Zongchang, and others in favor of protecting the richer river valley under Chen Tiaoyuan."
fengtian.224.a: "Back Chen"
fengtian.224.b: "Back Zhang"
fengtian.224.c: "Our involvement is done."

fengtian.225.t: "Kuomintang Defeated - New War Conference" 
fengtian.225.d1: "The Left Kuomintang have been successfully defeated. While this is great news and means that our allies control the Five Provinces, which gives us an enormous advantage against the [QIE.GetNameDef], it also introduces problems. Not long after the news broke that the Kuomintang were defeated, we received a telegram from Zhang Zongchang of the Shandong Clique.\n\nIn the telegram, which frequently goes off on a tangent and refuses to get to the point until the very end, Zhang describes the strength of our 'Old Alliance' and that as such, we should support him to receive control over the Five Provinces. This is rather outrageous, as this would certainly lead to war with the Anqing Clique, which would be a disaster. However, it is true that Zhang Zongchang and Zhang Zuolin go back a long way. We will need to hold another conference to determine a solution that both Zhang and Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique are satisfied with."
fengtian.225.d2: "The Left Kuomintang have been successfully defeated. While this is great news and means that our allies control the Five Provinces, which gives us an enormous advantage against the [QIE.GetNameDef], it also introduces problems. Not long after the news broke that the Kuomintang were defeated, we received a telegram from Zhang Zongchang of the Shandong Clique and Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique.\n\nZhang's telegram asks us to honor our old alliance and support him to press claims on the rest of the provine of Jiangsu (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong States), which he only partially controls. It is true that Zhang Zongchang and Zhang Zuolin go back a long way. Chen instead describes the fact that as the legitimate successor to the League, all of the Five Provinces should fall under his dominion. He demands that all of Jiangsu is returned to him at once. If things are to end well, we will have to hold another conference to determine a solution that both Zhang and Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique are satisfied with."

Not long after the news broke that the Kuomintang were defeated, we received a telegram from Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique.\n\nChen says it is outrageous that Zhang Zongchang of the Shandong Clique is allowed to hold all of Jiangsu (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong States) considering that Chen's Anqing Clique is the legitimate successor to the League. While he has a point, we never recognized the League originally and Zhang is an old friend. If things are to end well, we will have to hold another conference to determine a solution that both Zhang and Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique are satisfied with."
fengtian.225.a: "Think of a solution"
fengtian.225.b: "Let them fight it out"

fengtian.226.t: "Solution to the Conflict" 
fengtian.226.d1: "To us, it would be preferable if Zhang Zongchang would simply back down and let Chen control all the Five Provinces. This would save us a lot of trouble. However, with Zhang you can never be sure how he'll respond and forcing him to back down might lead to him doing what he wants regardless. Of course, he could also be scared of our military might and just agree. We will have to think this through carefully."
fengtian.226.d2: "With both Zhang and Chen currently unhappy, the problem becomes hard to solve. We could force either to back down and let the other have what they want, but that could end very badly. Most likely, we will have to come up with a compromise."
fengtian.226.d3: "It would be preferable if Chen Tiaoyuan just backs down and leaves Jiangsu to Zhang. This would most likely solve the issue. However, Chen is a proud man and sees his Anqing Clique as the true successor of the League, which necessarily contains all the Five Provinces, which includes Jiangsu. His victories and popular support mean it is unlikely he will simply relent. We will have to take a look at engineering a compromise."
fengtian.226.a: "Force Zhang to back down"
fengtian.226.b: "Force Chen to back down"
fengtian.226.c: "Come up with a compromise"

fengtian.227.t: "Compromise Solution" 
fengtian.227.d: "It is clear that Chen will not relent unless he can at least call himself master of Jiangsu (Xuhai, Huaiyang, Nantong) in some way. Zhang will also never be happy with being stuck with only Shandong. This means that we will have to split Jiangsu, one way or another. One possibility is to simply split the western Xuhai region, which would go to Zhang, from the eastern Huaiyang region, with the latter including Nantong and going to Chen. It is unlikely Chen will see this as sufficient as the province was ruled from Xuzhou, which is also where the province's most important railroads meet. Another possibility is to separate economic from political control. In this scenario, one would officially run Jiangsu's government, which would of course have to be led by at least a somewhat independent governor. Then the other would be allowed to nominate a lieutenant governor, who would have control over all the province's resources and be allowed to levy taxes and conduct recruitment among other things."
fengtian.227.a: "Split Jiangsu between them"
fengtian.227.b: "Chen gets Jiangsu, exploitation rights to Zhang"
fengtian.227.c: "Zhang gets Jiangsu, exploitation rights to Chen"

fengtian.228.t: "Fengtian Forces Us to Back Down!" 
fengtian.228.d: "The Fengtian government has said that our uncompromising attitude is the reason that no deal has been made. They say the only solution is that we back down and withdraw all our demands, otherwise they would have to seriously consider military action. This is of course outrageous and nothing like a proper permanent solution. We will have to call their bluff."
fengtian.228.a: "Call their bluff"

fengtian.229.t: "Fengtian Presents Compromise" 
fengtian.229.d1split: "The Fengtian government, in an effort to solve our problem with Shandong, has proposed a compromise. They say that by splitting the province of Jiangsu, we will both get something of value. We would get Huaiyang, including Nantong. Of course we cannot accept this, as Xuhai is the heart of Jiangsu, with the city of Xuzhou an important railway hub. We cannot accept giving a way a part of the Five Provinces! Fengtian has utterly failed to defuse the situation."
fengtian.229.d1specrzhang: "The Fengtian government, in an effort to solve our problem with Shandong, has proposed a compromise. They say that we will control the province politically. We would have to appoint a somewhat independent governor as a sign of goodwill towards Shandong. In exchange, Zhang would get economic control over the province, meaning he is allowed to levy taxes and conduct recruitment. This means we can plausibly say we control all of the Five Provinces. Allowing Zhang this economic control is a small price to pay for peace, especially if it makes Fengtian, our benfactor, happy."
fengtian.229.d1specrchen: "The Fengtian government, in an effort to solve our problem with Shandong, has proposed a compromise. They say that we would have allow political control to be in Zhang's hands, who would appoint a somewhat independent governor as a sign of goodwill. In exchange, we would get economic control over the province, which includes levying taxes. While this is nice, it would mean that on all maps, it would be Zhang that holds Jiangsu. We would be giving a way an integral part of our territory, one of the Five Provinces. This is unacceptable!"
fengtian.229.d2split: "The Fengtian government, in an effort to solve our problem with Shandong, has proposed a compromise. They say that by splitting the province of Jiangsu, we will both get something of value. We would get Xuhai, which includes the city of Xuzhou, which is an important railway hub. Of course we cannot accept this, as this leaves the region without sea access and also means that for all our efforts in the war, we only get half a province! We cannot accept such a laughable proposal. Fengtian has utterly failed to defuse the situation."
fengtian.229.d2specrzhang: "The Fengtian government, in an effort to solve our problem with Shandong, has proposed a compromise. They say that Chen will control the province politically and would have to appoint a somewhat independent governor as a sign of goodwill towards us. In exchange, we will get economic control over the province, meaning we will be allowed to levy taxes and conduct recruitment. While this means we will have no territorial expansion to show for our efforts against the League, the Jiangsu province is very rich. It would allow us to significantly bolster our ranks as well and gives us ample opportunity to expand our armies in order to strike again in the future. However, having full control remains ideal and if Chen is able to rebuild, it will be very difficult to ever defeat him."
fengtian.229.d2specrchen: "The Fengtian government, in an effort to solve our problem with Shandong, has proposed a compromise. They say that we would have full political control of Jiangsu, but we would have to appoint a somewhat independent governor as a sign of goodwill towards Anqing. In exchange, they would get economic control over the province, which includes levying taxes. Adding Jiangsu to our control means an enormous boost to the prestige of our government, even if it means we can not benefit economically as much as we'd like. This option is very tempting."

fengtian.236.d: "We have decided to support Zhang Zongchang's Shandong Clique in his fight against Chen Tiaoyuan of the Anqing Clique for control over the Five Provinces and Shandong.

fengtian.240.d: "The Anqing Clique has suggested a strategy. They are willing to go participate in the war, but only if we and our Japanese backers provide very generous and extensive aid to help them recover from the disastrous League War. This strategy would indeed bring them back to full strength quickly, but would cost us significant capital. We also do not know if the Japanese will accept. We can also think of other options."

However, we need any help we can get, and as such we could let it be and hope they join the war regardless once it has started.

Already our troops have begun burning, looting, and defiling the same towns and villages that our government claims to be liberating. Some would say that we should let the troops have their fun, but now that Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin is again competing on the national stage he must consider his image. He was once a bandit himself, and many here in the south have a hard time showing respect to or taking orders from a former criminal. Already the elite have turned up their noses, and while force might be an easy answer, we do need these intellectuals, landlords, and businessmen to forward our greater aims. It is these figures through whom we must rule. Fortunately, our logistics system is sufficient to feed our soldiers, meaning our men are not looting for survival, but nonetheless they will be unhappy to be kept from what they see as their right by conquest.\n\nHere we must choose: The liberators or the liberated?"
fengtian.270.a: "Let them have their fun."
fengtian.270.b: "We're not bandits anymore."

fengtian.271.t: "Feeding the North China Plain"
fengtian.271.d_food: "As we extend our authority over newly reclaimed areas, we must ensure that they too do their part in the march toward reunification. Unfortunately, the North China Plain is densely populated and consumes more food than it produces, turning otherwise richly taxable land into a drain on our resources. Fortunately Manchuria is vast and fertile, and thanks to our decision not to push through the 'Soy Agricultural Initiative' we can afford to feed most of the population."
fengtian.271.d_exports: "As we extend our authority over newly reclaimed areas, we must ensure that they too do their part in the march toward reunification. Unfortunately, the North China Plain is densely populated and consumes more food than it produces, turning otherwise richly taxable land into a drain on our resources. On the one hand, Manchuria is vast and fertile, and thanks to our decision not to push through the 'Soy Agricultural Initiative' we can afford to feed most of the population. On the other hand we are currently exporting all of our surplus grain to Japan to offset its current famine.\n\nHere we must choose: China or Japan? Do we put our own people first, or cower before Japanese martial supremacy?"
fengtian.271.d_soy: "As we extend our authority over newly reclaimed areas, we must ensure that they too do their part in the march toward reunification. Unfortunately, the North China Plain is densely populated and consumes more food than it produces, turning otherwise richly taxable land into a drain on our resources. Unfortunately, thanks to the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a great deal of Northeastern grain production has been replaced by soy cash crops. With barely enough food to feed the Northeast, we can't even begin to think about shipping food anywhere else.\n\nNorth China will have to endure a famine, one which will reflect poorly on our leadership."
fengtian.271.a: "Import grain from Manchuria"
fengtian.271.b: "We need the grain, stop exporting to Japan."
fengtian.271.c: "We can't stand up to them."
fengtian.271.e: "Those damn soy beans!"

fengtian.272.t: "Scandal in Beijing"
fengtian.272.d_bad: "A certain amount of looting was inevitable in Beijing. As the national capital for centuries, and home to generations of emperors, the wealth spread throughout the city's rampant bureaucracy has long been beyond measure. However, it is not material wealth that has seen the city now dragged into scandal. Supposedly some of our soldiers have been capturing the wives and concubines of government ministers and, after committing unspeakable acts, parading them through the city streets as trophies. To make matters worse, some have been placed on a makeshift scaffold and are being sold as if chattle to the highest bidder. In any disciplined army they would be executed for this behavior, and we have made assurances as such to the local population, but there is every possibility that the matter will be brushed under the rug by local commanders."

Fortunately, thanks to our code of conduct and the quick reactions of a less tolerant commander the majority of these soldiers have been imprionsed and await punishment."
fengtian.272.a: "Outrageous!"


fengtian.273.t: "Desecration in Yi County"
fengtian.273.d_bad: "Alarming news has emerged from Yi County in Zhili Province, where a number of Fengtian Army soldiers have blown open the entrance to several of the Western Qing Tombs. Ever since the vulgar desecration of Dowager Empress Cixi's resting place in 1928, by Zhang's indirect subordinate Sun Dianying no less, this subject has been used to damage the Grand Marshal's reputation in certain circles. With this new episode, so similar to the last, there may be no true recovery. The exact amount of wealth stolen from the tombs is unclear, but the soldiers involved disappeared into the reeds along Lake Baiyangdian, and the majority will likely make its way onto the black market soon."
fengtian.273.d_good: "Alarming news has emerged from Yi County in Zhili Province, where a number of Fengtian Army soldiers had reportedly begun placing dynamite at the entrance to the Western Qing Tombs. Ever since the vulgar desecration of Dowager Empress Cixi's resting place in 1928, by Zhang's indirect subordinate Sun Dianying no less, this subject has been used to damage the Grand Marshal's reputation in certain circles. With this new episode, so similar to the last, it is fortunate that a superior officer was able to prevent any serious damage. Regardless of the soldiers' supposedly republican intentions, it is important for the sake of national legitimacy that we respect our forebears. It is from their example of a single unified and unyielding China that we draw inspiration, if not practice."
fengtian.273.a: "Even monarchist history can be worth preserving!"

fengtian.274.t: "Disorder at Baoding"
fengtian.274.d: "Disturbing reports have begun to emerge from Boading Military Academy, which a company of our soldiers recently captured and occupied. As a military target in which the enemy held out for over a week, damage to the building was expected, as was some degree of looting, but few expected to hear of our men killing one another over the spoils. Supposedly the institution's store of medals and rank insignia was discovered shortly after its capture, creating several self-declared colonels, majors, and generals, each belonging to a variety of self-awarded honorable orders. These men, completely ignorant of the actual standing granted by their regalia, began to fight over precedence. By the time troops arrived from elsewhere to relieve the actual commander, the upstart soldiers had split into a number of cliques occupying different parts of the academy, and several dozen were dead."
fengtian.274.a: "There can only be one Grand Marshal"

fengtian.275.t: "Order returns to Zhili Province"
fengtian.275.d_bad: "After a wave of spontaneous and occasionally indiscriminate looting, burning, and other criminal behavior by our troops, order has returned to Zhili Province. By and large, the soldiers simply burned themselves out. This episode will not be regarded highly by the peasants who bore the brunt of the violence, nor by landlords, business owners, or government officials. While this will eventually blur together with the rest of the atrocities of the warlord era, it will make governing the vast areas of newly conquered territory no easier."
fengtian.275.d_good: "After our troops swept across Zhili Province the majority of the population braced themselves for a wave of indiscriminate violence. But, despite a few unavoidable incidents, our troops have largely kept to the code of conduct set out by Marshal Zhang. Some stubborn figures have attributed the surprise to Fengtian's advanced system of logistics, which reduced the need for our armies to live off of the land, instead of praising Zhang himself. Still, even they cannot ignore results, and this performance will go a long way toward earning the nation's trust."
fengtian.275.a: "At least it's over."

##Luoyang-Zhengzhou Events
fengtian.276.t: "Railway Chaos in Zhengzhou"
fengtian.276.d_bad: "Apparently, as soon as our troops seized Zhengzhou, they descended on its railway station. As the heart of the nation's railway network in wartime, and perhaps due our enemies' dogged attempts to defend it, the tracks were crowded with rolling stock - full to the brim with refugee belongings and war materiel. The subsequent orgy of looting has seen railway traffic in the area backed up for days, as every last car has been ransacked, and while we have seized a certain amount of military equipment from the cars, the majority are now wrecked and unusable. It will take a long time to clear them from the railway, and longer still for the city's former residents to forget the blatant theft of their belongings."
fengtian.276.d_good: "Apparently, as soon as our troops seized Zhengzhou, they descended on its railway station. As the heart of the nation's railway network in wartime, and perhaps due our enemies' dogged attempts to defend it, the tracks were crowded with rolling stock - full to the brim with refugee belongings and war materiel. Looting began almost immediately, but fortunately some of our officers were able to limit the activity to only half of the rail cars, with the officers themselves taking only a further quarter. Consequently what might have turned into a logistical disaster, where looted rolling stock blocked the tracks for days, became a relatively orderly affair that left at least something behind for the city's residents."
fengtian.276.a: "What's left?"

fengtian.277.t: "Bandits against Bandits"
fengtian.277.d_bad: "Our troops recently seized Luoyang alongside most of Henan Province's major cities, but securing the countryside has proven another matter. Banditry has long history in Henan, and despite nearly a decade of Zhili rule this problem never truly went away. The majority were simply incorporated into Wu Peifu's armies. Now they are sweeping across the province's rural regions, and having 'defected' to our side, are claiming the spoils of a war they never won.\n\nOur own troops, feeling cheated, are now engaging in competitive looting and destruction, occasionally escalating into localized but coordinated battles. The planned arrival of some more orderly troops to the area ought to calm tensions so that the actual bandits can be rounded up, but the damage is already done. The combined destruction is being compared to a natural disaster."

Now they are sweeping across the province's rural regions, and having 'defected' to our side, have begun claiming the spoils of a war they never won.\n\nOur own troops have stepped in to quell the violence, but thoroughly combing Henan's hills and riversides will take time and energy; neither of which our troops would prefer to spend. In all likelyhood bandit activity will resume again some time in the future, and everything already stolen is now in the hands of our own troops."
fengtian.277.a: "Bandits everywhere!"

fengtian.278.t: "Order returns to Henan Province"
fengtian.278.d_bad: "After transportation chaos, endemic violence, and a wave of all too familiar banditry, Henan province has settled back into relative normality. Times are still hard for the average peasant, and brigands still roam the hills, but by and large our own troops have burned themselves out and settled down. Henan in particular has seen its fair share of famine, violence, and other tragedy, in which this may be little more than a historical footnote, but for the lives it touched, and certainly the lives it claimed, the events of [GetYear] will never be forgotten."
fengtian.278.d_good: "After some inevitable violence, and a wave of all too familiar banditry, Henan has settled back into relative normality. The province is no stranger to tragedy, and so the relatively decent conduct of our troops throughout has turned some heads. Local business owners, landlords, and government officials appreciate our soldiers' restraint, and it's their support that will be essential to governing the province in the future."
fengtian.278.a: "At least it's over."


##Wuhan Events
fengtian.279.t: "Destruction in Wuhan"
fengtian.279.d_bad: "China's republican dream was born in Wuhan, and today we are its torchbearers. Sadly revolutionary ideals were far from the minds of our soldiers who, after encountering unexpected resistance in Wuchang, proceeded to run wild through the city, looting indiscriminately. By the time order was restored, the docks, wharfs, and all manner of river-side businesses were reduced to ashes, along with sizable residential areas. What might have otherwise served as political victory became a political defeat, and a mark of shame.\n\nOn a more positive note, our troops were able to recover a stockpile of equipment from the now abandoned Hanyang Arsenal, though it is suspected that a certain number of weapons were siphoned away and onto the black market."
fengtian.279.d_good: "China's republican dream was born in Wuhan, and today we are its torchbearers. Fortunately this seems to have been on the minds of our soldiers when entering the city, which survived the fighting relatively unharmed, especially as looting was limited. After fighting their way across the North China Plain, it seems our troops have begun to acknowledge the benefits of a grateful populace. Our army, consisting as it does of so many former bandits and vagabonds, may never change completely, but today's relative restraint is a step forward.\n\nTo add to the good news, our troops have recovered a stockpile of equipment from the now abandoned Hanyang Arsenal."
fengtian.279.a: "Shameful"
fengtian.279.b: "What a relief!"

fengtian.280.t: "Disaster at the Daye Mines"
fengtian.280.d: "Ore has been mined at Daye for over two thousand years, and today iron from its depths feeds the fires of modern industry in Wuhan, Hubei, and the Lower Yangtze. This did nothing to stop our soldiers, who upon hearing rumors that gold was to be found there, plundered the mine and, in their disappointment at finding nothing of the sort, collapsed its entrance - trapping over one hundred miners inside. A rescue effort has been proposed, but such expense is widely considered wasted on common laborers. Those responsible for the disaster, meanwhile, have deserted and are nowhere to be found."
fengtian.280.a: "Begin rescue operations."
fengtian.280.b: "Life is cheap."

fengtian.281.t_bad: "Tragedy in the Mines"
fengtian.281.t_good: "Miners Rescued in Daye"
fengtian.281.d_bad: "By the time our men broke through to the trapped miners in Daye, all had perished. While this is certainly not the outcome we were hoping for, the fact that our men tried at all has been received well by the local community, and more importantly by national newspapers."
fengtian.281.d_good: "Thanks to an old O&K steam shovel brought over from a neighboring mine, our soldiers were able to break through in time to rescue dozens of miners. Despite their initial reservations, the men seem to feel that the heartfelt gratitude of the laborers and their families made it well worth the effort, and praise by national newspapers has offset most political fallout from the disaster itself.\n\nTo add to the positive turn of events, an assortment of weapons crates were brought up by the grateful miners, which had apparently been stashed there during the enemy's retreat not so long ago."
fengtian.281.a: "What a waste."
fengtian.281.b: "Wansui!"

fengtian.282.t: "Remember the Experience in Ju"
fengtian.282.d: "The years since the formation of our Government have laid for us a solid foundation for national regeneration. We fear no problems, nor are we concerned over impending dangers. We merely lament the fate of the South, the freedom of which was originally brought about by the hard efforts and sacrifices of reformist patriots, and which has since been erased by the old and outmoded forms of government. Today, her people are powerless, and her rulers without integrity, thus allowing the slow degradation of the national condition, and the return to a state of total subservience to Western nations. These old ways are sapping China's national strength, shaking her national foundations, and subjugating her people.\n\nIt is thus that we find ourselves in the North, as the final bastion of all that our predecessors struggled to build, and the bearers of the future of a new China. The regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] government likes to say that, by fortifying the Northeast, we are 'digging a hole to die in'. To this I say 'Forget not what happened in Ju'. It was to Ju that the State of Qi retreated, and from there that it reconquered all that it had lost. When the time is right, the Northeast will be our Ju, and the whole of China will be our Qi. Our victory is inevitable, long live the Republic!"
fengtian.282.a: "Wansui!"

fengtian.283.t: "The Grand Marshal's Proclamation"
fengtian.283.d: "An old proverb says: 'Virtue never lacks company; it will ever find support.' The forces of justice will rise, and men of goodwill ultimately co-operate in the interests of rectitude. There is little question that the regressive and illegitimate [QIE.GetAdjective] government stands in the way of progress, oppressing and subjugating the Chinese people, and I have received every assurance that our allies will stand with us to end this injustice. On our part, we should hold fast, fix our eyes steadfastly on our goal, and be firm in our determination. The entire Northeast should carry on with oneness of heart. The final victory will be ours. I urge my ministers, our army, and our people to redouble their efforts in order to attain success.\n\nIt is in this spirit, that I proclaim the beginning of the Year of Righteous Effort, a full three hundred and sixty five days of strenuous national effort, from which we shall emerge as a force unstoppable in the pursuit of our goal. And, when this year is done, the Five Colour Flag will fly high again in Beijing, and the [QIE.GetAdjective] government will be nothing but ash in the winds of history. Ten thousand years to the Republic! Zhonghua Mingguo Wansui!"
fengtian.283.a: "Wansui!"

fengtian.284.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Demands Integration!"
fengtian.284.d: "The Central Government under [FNG.GetLeader] has demanded that we formally relinquish control of our armies and territory. While [ROOT.GetLeader] and his subordinates will be permitted to retain their current titles and positions, there is no way to know what the future might bring. On the one hand surrendering most of our autonomy would be the patriotic thing to do, and perhaps the safest in the short term. On the other hand, freedom is sweet."

fengtian.284.b: "We shall not submit."

fengtian.285.t: "Deciding our terms"
fengtian.285.d: "The time has come, long has the nation labored under the Japanese yoke and today our leadership under [FNG.GetLeader] must decide what terms to deliver to the upstart devils in Tokyo, and determine thus whether we shall be able to coexist as equals or the Chinese people must with their overwhelming might sweep away the Japanese invader from the Middle Kingdom."
fengtian.285.a: "Demand the withdrawal of the Kwantung Army!"
fengtian.285.b: "Demand the withdrawal of the Kwantung Army and the Return of all Major territories!"
fengtian.285.c: "Demand the Kantung Army withdraw and every inch of Chinese land returned!"
fengtian.285.e: "Demand every last Japanese mongrel be expelled from our home!"

fengtian.2851.t: "Fengtian's Ultimatum"
fengtian.2851.d: "A representative of the Fengtian Government has delivered an ultimatum to our consulate in [FNG.Capital.GetName], demanding that we remove our military presence from China over the next three months. The most radical and domineering elements of the military claim this flagrant disrespect, made all the more despicable in light of our long-standing cooperation with [FNG.GetLeader], cannot go unanswered. However most sensible voices especially from the Foreign Ministry suggest that this token concession is a bargain in exchange for securing a lasting alliance with China, especially when one considers how it is dwarfed by the costs of the alternative."
fengtian.2851.a: "Punish this utter insolence!"
fengtian.2851.b: "Give them what they want."

fengtian.2852.d: "A representative of the Fengtian Government has delivered an ultimatum to our consulate in [FNG.Capital.GetName], demanding that we remove our military presence from China over the next three months, and return every major Chinese territory we hold. According to the most hawkish members of the military this flagrant disrespect, made all the more despicable in light of our long-standing cooperation with [FNG.GetLeader], cannot go unanswered. However some quieter voices from the Foreign Ministry and more moderate officers concede that while the loss of swathes of Chinese land will be a massive loss of potential manpower and resources, that the terms are nothing unexpected, and suggest that this might be the only way to secure a lasting alliance with China."
fengtian.2852.a: "Punish this utter insolence!"

Our Entire military is unanimously spitting with fury at this flagrant disrespect, made all the more despicable in light of our long-standing cooperation with [FNG.GetLeader], and cry that such an affront cannot go unanswered. Even the Foreign Ministry is at an uproar, pointing out the logistical impossibility of evacuating all settlers as well as little as half of our assets from China with only the most pessimistic of voices urging that such a war would be far too costly."
fengtian.2854.a: "Punish this utter insolence!"
fengtian.2854.b: "We can't afford another war in China."

fengtian.286.t: "Japan Accepts Our Demands!"

fengtian.2862.a: "A China free of Imperialists at last."

fengtian.287.t: "Zuolin contemplates Retirement"
fengtian.287.d: "Among rumors throughout Fengtian, a prevailing one speaks of an intention for Zhang Zuolin to step back from his position as President of the Republic, making way for his son Xueliang - a promising young man with a Western education, albeit also a troubling if not uncommon relationship with opium. Zuolin would stay on as Grand Marshal, cementing his control over the military, and many are already cynical that such a move would simply be a way for Zhang to draw attention away from his past banditry and military service, traits considered unbecoming of a national political leader, while retaining a de-facto monopoly on power."
fengtian.287.a: "China needs a fresh face, Long live the President!."
fengtian.287.b: "China needs him still, Long live the Grand Marshal!."

fengtian.288.t: "The Shikan Clique Protests"
fengtian.288.d1: "The Shikan Clique, a group of officers within the Fengtian Army educated at Japanese academies, has quietly but forcefully protested Zhang Zuolin's decision to hand the presidency to his son. Citing Zhang Xueliang's addiction to opium, and his well-known years of carousing in Shanghai's casinos and pleasure palaces, Yang Yuting, the de-facto face of the Shikan group, called the move 'dangerous and divisive'. This is likely an attempt by Yang to jockey for additional power within the Fengtian Clique as a whole, but more concerningly he may also be speaking for the Kwantung Army, which is known to distrust Xueliang due to his anti-Japanese leanings."
fengtian.288.d2: "The Shikan Clique, a group of officers within the Fengtian Army educated at Japanese academies, has quietly but forcefully critisized Zhang Zuolin's continued hold on power. Citing Zhang's unglamorous past of banditry, and quietly insinuating that Zuolin has no care for the principles of the Xinhai Revolution, simply caring only to fatten his power, Yang Yuting, the de-facto face of the Shikan group, called his continued rule "A concerning disregard for national values". This is likely an attempt by Yang to jockey for additional power within the Fengtian Clique as a whole, but more concerningly he may also be speaking for the Kwantung Army, who have long been a thorn in Zuolin's side."
fengtian.288.a: "Ineffectual ditherings."

fengtian.289.t: "A Sinister Plot"
fengtian.289.d1: "An unusual notice has made it's way to the government's attention, passed along by Kenji Doihara, whose clandestine operations are well known within our intelligence circles. Apparently Yang Yuting, an influential and notably pro-Japanese general within the Fengtian Army, is plotting the overthrow and assassination of Zhang Zuolin. The move seems to have been spurred by Zhang's decision to grant his son the presidency, which may simply reflect factional squabbling, but the appointment has already been concerning for many in the War Ministry. Zhang Xueliang's anti-Japanese sentiments are well known, and should he seize any real power there could be consequences for our relationship with the Fengtian Government, and our long-laid plans in China as a whole.\n\n"We could choose to support Yang Yuting's power grab, and he is a well known friend to Japan. On the other hand some in the Foreign Ministry are advising caution, and alleging that this entire operation is a product of meddling by our own units based in Manchuria. The Kwantung Army has long been known to have far more assertive foreign policy inclinations than the government in Tokyo."

fengtian.290.t: "Ambush in Shenyang!"
fengtian.290.d: "In the middle of a busy Shenyang street, Zhang Zuolin's custom-built armor-plated car suddenly came under fire as a small bomb exploded under its wheels. The vehicle was thrown violently upward, and then careened into a nearby tailor's shop. A shootout immediately began as hidden ambushers on both sides of the street appeared from windows, alleys and began to open fire on the car's surviving occupants, nearby policemen arrived to find themselves exchanging fire with well armed and equipped combatants, with storms of lead being exchanged as further soldiers and armed police made their way to the battle, when finally the ambushers finally withdrew under the mounting pressure of reinforcements, before them laid the remains of the ambush."

fengtian.291.d: "Zhang Zuolin was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by assassins on Shenyang's Zhaode main street only a matter of hours ago. It was his leadership that served to underpin the entirety of the Fengtian Clique and its government, and now the power vacuum left in his wake threatens to swallow the entirety of the Northeast. Soon every soldier and officer, every contact and associate of the Old Marshal, must question his loyalties and pick a side - if there are even to be sides at all. As of now two loose factions seem set to emerge: a collection of loyalists and nationalists beneath Zhang Xueliang's banner, facing a number of Japanese-educated officers and opportunists aligned with Yang Yuting, who almost certainly had some role to play in Zuolin's assassination. Whoever strikes a decisive blow first will be entitled to Zhang Zuolin's legacy."
fengtian.291.a: "Xueliang rallies his father's loyalists."
fengtian.291.b: "Yang Yuting receives unexpected support."
fengtian.291.c: "The Kwantung Army moves in to support Yuting's takeover."

fengtian.292.t: "Zhang Xueliang Rallies The Government"
fengtian.292.d: "After convincing the remnants of the cabinet and most of the general staff to take his side, either through persuasion or more coercive means, Zhang Xueliang has emerged as the sole victor following his father's untimely demise. Yang Yuting, meanwhile, has been politically defeated, and soon retreated to a safe-house outside Shenyang to recoup his losses and take stock of the situation.\n\nYang still holds influence with a number of the Fengtian Army's most talented commanders, and so he may be betting on Zhang Xueliang's willingness to compromise and worry that, without them, he may fall behind his enemies elsewhere in China, or even in Japan."
fengtian.292.a: "The Young Marshal will have his chance."

fengtian.293.t: "A Mystery Solved"
fengtian.293.d.zuolin: "As the fires on Zhaode Main Street are put out and the bodies recovered from the rubble, the exact identity and motivation of the attackers has supposedely been discovered, the Kempeitai reporting that they had broken the cypher on the documents, finding it matches ones used by the Germans, and that a further investigation had linked him to a cell of Zhili partisans operating with backing from German East Asia. And that the remaining collaborators had been found trying to escape to Singapore via cargo freighter from Tianjin. Though some vocal investigators claim there are contradictions in the supposed cypher and what they remember of the documents, and that Zhili records in Beijing do not line up with the presence of this supposed cell. However, their pleading falls on deaf ears as the answer has satisfied most of our administration, regardless, we must count ourselves fortunate that Zhang Zuolin survived the attack, against all odds." #Zuolin's POV
fengtian.293.d.xueliang: "As the fires on Zhaode Main Street are put out and the bodies recovered from the rubble, the exact identity and motivation of the attackers has supposedely been discovered, the Kempeitai reporting that they had broken the cypher on the documents, finding it matches ones used by the Germans, and that a further investigation had linked him to a cell of Zhili partisans operating with backing from German East Asia. And that the remaining collaborators had been found trying to escape to Singapore via cargo freighter from Tianjin. Though some vocal investigators claim there are contradictions in the supposed cypher and what they remember of the documents, and that Zhili records in Beijing do not line up with the presence of this supposed cell. However, their pleading falls on deaf ears as the answer has satisfied most of our administration." #Xueliang's POV
fengtian.293.a: "The Zhili have made their last strike"

fengtian.294.t: "Zhang Zuolin's Funeral"
fengtian.294.d: "A great white banner flutters over the front portico of the Zhang residence in downtown Shenyang, and from the gates a procession slowly winds its way toward the central square. An auspicious day has been selected for the funeral, and already the streets are lined with citizens paying their respects, or simply caught up in the moment. Before them passes an impressive funeral cortege, replete with all the Old Marshal's earthly possessions rendered in paper, so that they may be burned and carried with him up to heaven. Eventually the pallbearers will reach a stone mausoleum outside Shenyang, where the story of this once-bandit who came to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Presidents and Emperors will finally come to an end. "
fengtian.294.a: "Farewell, Old Marshal."

fengtian.295.t: "The Purge of the Shikan Clique"
fengtian.295.d: "The invitation to play cards came as something of a surprise to Yang Yuting, who had expected a more formal summons. Nontheless, he interpreted the letter as a good sign - perhaps Zhang Xueliang had seen the light and decided to negotiate. He might be taking a risk by walking into the Young Marshal's arms, but it was one he had to take.\n\nHis car arrived at Zhang's mansion in the early evening, and upon entering the main hall he received a bullet to the back of the head. There would be no negotiating after all.\n\nThe Shikan Clique has subsequently been dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals will be allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence. The Fengtian Army's cohesion has taken a great blow today, but there could be no other answer."
fengtian.295.a: "Such is justice."

fengtian.296.t: "Japan is the True Enemy"
fengtian.296.d.zuolin: "Yang Yuting's attempt to seize power was no great surprise, but evidence has now come to light implicating not only the Kwantung Army in the Zhaode Incident but also the Japanese Government itself. After a miraculous breakthrough in deciphering the documents found on the suspect, Zhang's own bodyguard, a Japanese exile by the name of Araki Goro was stated as a member of the plan by name!. After a swift arrest and interrogation, he admitted the Kwantung Army's attempts to involve him in the assassination attempt, and explained that the plan had backing from Tokyo. Now there can be no question of where Japan stands." #Zuolin's POV
fengtian.296.d.xueliang: "Yang Yuting's attempt to seize power was no great surprise, but evidence has now come to light implicating not only the Kwantung Army in the Zhaode Incident but also the Japanese Government itself. After a miraculous breakthrough in deciphering the documents found on the suspect, The late Marshal's own bodyguard, a Japanese exile by the name of Araki Goro was stated as a member of the plan by name!. After a swift arrest and interrogation, he admitted the Kwantung Army's attempts to involve him in the assassination attempt, and explained that the plan had backing from Tokyo. Now there can be no question of where Japan stands." #Xueliang's POV
fengtian.296.a: "How could we trust them?"

fengtian.297.t: "Fengtian Denounces Us!"
fengtian.297.d.zuolin: "Though still recovering from his serious wounds, Zhang Zuolin has loudly denounced our involvement in the botched attempt against his life. Though this is an embarrassing moment for us, as few expected him to survive or much less discover our involvement, it is also one of crisis. We cannot take this direct challenge lying down, but aggressive action would destroy our only partnership on the Chinese mainland, and render the whole of the country hostile once again. There is no easy way out of this mess." #Zuolin alive
fengtian.297.d.xueliang: "Much to our surprise Zhang Xueliang, believed by most to be an opium-riddled bohemian, has not only prevailed against Yang Yuting but also discovered our involvement in his father's assassination. His fury is not difficult to read, and today the Young Marshal denounced our actions before the world. Though this is an embarrassing moment for us, we cannot take this direct challenge lying down. Yet aggressive action would destroy our only partnership on the Chinese mainland, and render the whole of the country hostile once again. There is no easy way out of this mess." #Xueliang took over
fengtian.297.a: "Punish their insolence!"
fengtian.297.b: "We can do nothing."

fengtian.298.t: "The Zhaode Dajie Incident"
fengtian.298.d: "It seems that the attack on Zhaode Main Street was carried out at the behest of none other than Yang Yuting, leader of the Shikan Clique. After his agents' simultaneous plans were foiled across the country, Yang retreated to a safehouse outside Shenyang. From there he may have intended to flee or fight back, but ultimately it didn't matter. Once it became known that Yang had taken up residence, the structure was levelled by heavy artillery at Zuolin's own direction. A body, which may or may not have been Yang's, was pulled from the wreckage, its head decapitated and placed on a pike.\n\nFrom there Shikan Clique was subsequently dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals were allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence. The Fengtian Army's cohesion has taken a great blow as a consequence, but to such treachery there could be no other answer."
fengtian.298.a: "Such is justice."

fengtian.299.t: "Yuting Takes Over"
fengtian.299.d: "Travelers attempting to enter Shenyang this evening were shocked to witness troops of the Kwantung Army rush out of the darkness and onto the roads, hurriedly deploying searchlights, sandbags, and machine guns along all the city's main thoroughfares. Soon their opposition arrived, batallions of Fengtian Army troops from Fushin, Liaoyang, and Xinmin, called there by Zhang Xueliang's plea for reinforcements. As these troops attempted to negotiate their way into the city, Yang Yuting's forces seized key positions across Shenyang in a matter of hours. By dawn, and with the Japanese troops refusing to budge, the Young Marshal's resistance had been crushed, and Japan announced its intent to 'safeguard regional security' by deploying additional troops in the area. Unable to break the deadlock and now threatened by crack Japanese divisions, loyalist units around the city peeled away and broke apart - mirroring others across the country as Japanese troops soon swept across the region.\n\nThe Fengtian Government is, for all intents and purposes, dead. With Yang Yuting at the helm, the age of warlords in Fengtian is over, the time of co-prosperity has come."
fengtian.299.a: "A new era."

fengtian.300.t: "A Puppet in Manchuria"
fengtian.300.d: "All our best efforts in Manchuria have come to fruition. With Zhang Zuolin dead and Zhang Xueliang out of the picture, Yang Yuting should prove a pliable puppet suited to our purposes. While we may no longer have an easy route to control of China as a whole, we have safeguarded our own security. Without Manchurian resources our economy would founder, and from there an enemy could easily take Korea, then plunge a dagger into the heart of Japan. This is how history is made."
fengtian.300.a: "Excellent!"

fengtian.301.t: "The End of Fengtian"
fengtian.301.d: "The situation in Manchuria appears dire. With Zhang's death, the Fengtian Government has essentially collapsed upon itself, and if we do not intervene their enemies will soon overrun them, invalidating all our work to make Manchuriua secure. This region is our national lifeline, our guarantee against Western hegemony, and it is under our protection."
fengtian.301.a: "Send an ultimatum!"

fengtian.302.t: "Japan Sends an Ultimatum"
fengtian.302.d: "Japan has sent us an ultimatum - cease all hostilities against the Fengtian Government, or face war with the Empire. Manchuria has long been at the forefront of Japan's national strategy, and it is unlikely they will back down."
fengtian.302.a: "We cannot afford a war with Japan."
fengtian.302.b: "Their interference ends now!"

fengtian.303.t: "[FROM.GetCliqueShortName] Refuses our Ultimatum"
fengtian.303.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has refused our ultimatum. We would have been happy with a peaceful and prosperous Manchuria, but now the time has come to settle this matter once and for all. Our glorious war dead, spirits of the 1905 war, now scattered across the plains of Manchuria, will watch from the heavens and see us to victory!"
fengtian.303.a: "Banzai!"

fengtian.304.t: "The Japanese Ultimatum"
fengtian.304.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] has accepted an ultimatum from Japan to cease hostilities with the Fengtian Government. As part of their alliance, we must now comply with the ceasefire terms."
fengtian.304.a: "Very well."

fengtian.305.t: "Whispers from Tokyo"
fengtian.305.d: "Word has come from our spies in Tokyo - the Japanese may be preparing for war. Supposedly our Manchurian enemies have requested Japanese assistance in their war against us, which is now under consideration by the Imperial Cabinet and General Headquarters. On the one hand this news is a tacit acknowledgement by Fengtian that it has lost all claim to legitimacy, direct reliance on Japan is a political blow from which it may never recover, but on the other hand it is deeply troubling. Even now Japan's vast imperial war machine may be rumbling to life, to be stopped only by the most resolute defense."
fengtian.305.a: "We shall learn of their decision soon."

fengtian.306.t: "Attacks on the South Manchuria Railway"
fengtian.306.d: "Left to their own devices for over two weeks, the loyalists in Harbin launched a series of coordinated attacks along the South Manchurian Railway. Fortunately some of our commanders acted on their own initiative and, with help from Japanese Railway Zone guards, were able to limit the damage and push the outnumbered enemy back into the city.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal street-by-street fight across the city, one which the loyalists had obviously prepared for, and our casualties mounted quickly. In a final act of defiance, the enemy detonated explosives inside several factories, but by daybreak silence ruled the city - broken only by occasional gunshots marking the executions of survivors.\n\nHarbin is ours once again."
fengtian.306.a: "At least they're dealt with"

fengtian.307.t: "A Meeting with Merchants"
fengtian.307.d: "The Fengtian Chamber of Commerce represents the interests of numerous merchants in Shenyang and across the Northeast, most of whom are responsible for the proper functioning of our economy - at least those parts of it still outside Japanese hands. Their bargaining power is considerable, and with new authorities in the capital, they are hoping for a new deal that better serves themselves.\n\nZhang Zuolin famously shot several merchants and bankers for refusing him favorable terms, but doing the same now would set a poor precedent for our new administration - one supposedly introducing order and civilization to a war-weary China.\n\nHowever, it would set an equally bad precedent to accept terms worse than our predecessor."
fengtian.307.a: "Perhaps we can grease some palms"
fengtian.307.b: "Maybe Zhang had the right idea"
fengtian.307.c: "Never mind for now"

fengtian.308.t: "Restoring Order to Manchuria"
fengtian.308.d: "Despite the death of 'Grand Marshal' Zhang Zuolin, some of his legacy yet remains. Various civilian authorities across the region have either ignored or refused the order to recognize our new administration, and some still loyal to his cause have reportedly been coalescing in Harbin - perhaps to make a last stand.\n\nFor the time being our resources will be more limited than we might prefer, and we should focus our efforts on returning control and good government to Manchuria. The last remnants of Zhang's government must be swept away."
fengtian.308.a: "Onward!"

fengtian.309.t: "Pressing North"
fengtian.309.d: "With the threat at Harbin eliminated, our Japanese advisors have recommended that we advance north along the railway. These frigid regions of Manchuria, themselves as large as some European countries put together, were beyond even Zhang Zuolin's direct control at times and again prove troublesome.\n\nOur greatest concern, however, ought to be the Russians, who have on occasion tested our borders and notoriously covet the Chinese Eastern Railway - seized from them over a decade ago. The Japanese want the Russians checked at the Amur."
fengtian.309.a: "It will be done"

fengtian.310.t: "Monarchism Rises Within the Concordia Association"
fengtian.310.d: "In the turmoil since Yang Yuting’s coup, all sense of political stability has gone out the window, and much of Fengtian has been thrown into chaos. Among this chaos, many fresh political ideologies and beliefs have begun to sprout once more - none more prevalent than the desire for the return of dynastic monarchical rule. Most commonly seen within the wings of the Concordia Association, these Manchurian monarchists believe that only through the stabilizing force of a monarchy based along the old dynastic system can truly manage the unruly beast that is China. Seeing the Qing as nothing more than a decaying, corrupt dynasty that has sullied the Manchu name, these Dynasists instead desire a new face to sit on the Dragon Throne, tho who that shall be is still hotly debated within their camp. Before that can even be decided, these monarchist zealots must first seize power, and to do that they must convince the rest of the Concordia Association that this is the only way to save the Fengtian government."
fengtian.310.a: "We won our right to a republican government with the Xinhai Revolution!"
fengtian.310.b: "Dynastic rule is only natural for the people of China."

fengtian.311.t: "Republican Elements Outraged"
fengtian.311.d: "With the Concordia Association’s decision to fully drift towards the ideas of monarchism and dynastic rule, the many varied republican elements within the Fengtian Government have begun to decry this act as tyranny and a return to outdated and archaic traditions - ones they claim will hamstring China for an eternity while their republican movement would be a so-claimed ticket to modern utopia. We laugh at these false hopes and naive dreams! Only we know that China requires a strong, regal hand to keep its unruly masses in check and safe, both from foreign enemies and themselves."
fengtian.311.a: "Let them howl into the wind. We have a destiny to fulfil!"

fengtian.401.t: "Rebuilding Co-Prosperity?"
fengtian.401.d: "With the ultimatum recently issued to Tokyo, and their acceptance, we have seen fit to abide by our promises, and maintain diplomatic niceties if nothing else. This ,however, leaves a question, shall we continue to keep them at arm's length or recommit ourselves to a more equal friendship with Japan. Many among our number still see the Emprie accross the sea as little more than Imperialists, or near Imperialists, to be tolerated at best, but it is undeniable that for all their faults, the partnership was not without it's fruits."
fengtian.401.a: "We shall maintain present economic ties, but no more"
fengtian.401.b: "Pompous Foreigners they may be, but we wish for no war with them"
fengtian.401.c: "Our part in Co-Prosperity is not done yet"

fengtian.312.t: "Who Shall Take Our Throne?"
fengtian.312.d: "Now that the Concordia Association has brought the righteous ideals of monarchism back to the Fengtian government, now comes the herculean task of choosing who shall be the monarch we rally around as we endeavor to retake Beijing and place our chosen candidate on the Dragon Throne. For this decision, two main camps have formed within the Concordia Association. The nativist camp seeks to restore a candidate of true Chinese blood not of the Qing dynasty to position of emperor, casting off the disgrace that has been Pu-Yi and the Qing in Beijing and redeeming the idea of a Chinese monarchy in the eyes of the people since the tyranny and madness of the Hongxian Emperor. Alternatively, the Japanophiles instead seek to place a member of the Japanese Imperial Family on the throne, drawing the Fengtian Government and eventually all of China even closer into the Japanese sphere of influence. However the dark horse of the factions, composed of collaborationists seeks to revive the Qing under Aisin Gioro Xianyu, better known to us as Yoshiko Kawashima, a Manchu noblewoman said to greatly sympathize with our cause. Whichever faction prevails shall claim the Mandate of Heaven from petty warlords and perfidious demogogues until we and our Japanese allies are the true masters of the Middle Kingdom."
fengtian.312.a: "Crown the Japanese Candidate."
fengtian.312.b: "Crown the Chinese Candidate."
fengtian.312.c: "Crown Kawashima and declare the restoration of the Qing."

fengtian.314.t: "A Japanese Emperor"
fengtian.314.d: "The Japanese Empire has proven themselves to be valuable allies, With Beijing in our grasp and Japan at our side, we have been given a unique opportunity to place a member of their Imperial Family on the Dragon Throne in the Forbidden City of Beijing. Though this move would likely anger many millions of Chinese citizens, they are in no position to argue, bargain, or even fight back. While it would be only right for the emperor himself to take the dragon throne, we still have the choice of whom should be the representitive of the Imperial Family's rule once they are coronated as the new Emperor of China?"
fengtian.314.a: "The Showa Emperor himself, Hirohito, shall reign as Emperor of China and Japan."
fengtian.314.b: "The noble Prince Kan’in Kotohito shall rule as the representitive of the Emperor"
fengtian.314.c: "Prince Chichibu Yasuhito shall rule in the Emperor's stead."
fengtian.314.e: "Emperor Yasuhito shall rule as the regent of 2 Empires!"

fengtian.315.t: "The Rebirth of the Dragon Throne"
fengtian.315.d_ming: "With the decision of the Concordia Association, Zhu Yuxun, the Marquis of Extended Grace and the true heir to the Ming Dynasty, has been crowned as Emperor of China. A true ethnic Chinese by blood, he was seen as the safe choice by many within the congress, who felt that a Japanese national sitting on the Dragon Throne would cause far more chaos than order - the exact opposite of the intent of this plan to unify China. With the coronation underway, Zhu Yuxun shall take on the name of the first Ming emperor to give honor to the dynasty he is about to resurrect, and China, under the new Emperor Hóngwú shall be the new unifying force of the Fengtian Government as they prepare to retake this new emperor’s throne in Beijing."
fengtian.315.d_qing: "With the decision of the Concordia Association, Aisin Gioro Xianyu or known also to many as Yoshiko Kawashima, the distant cousin of Puyi and now Empress of China, has succeeded Puyi, a Manchu noblewoman by birth who was raised in Japan, Shocking many in our regime who have cried foul at the absurd decision to once again fly the Qing dynasty we have gone to such pains to topple, many within Manchuria and the Fengtian Government have understandably voiced their opposition to the matter, even the other factions in the concordia association have cried out, either surmising that she is nothing but a Japanese puppet or claiming that the Qing have already disgraced themselves, but now it matters not. We must band together behind this new monarch if our righteous government has any hopes of surviving"
fengtian.315.d_hirohito: "With the decision of the Concordia Association, Emperor Shōwa, or as he is more widely known as Hirohito, Emperor of Japan and the Co-Prosperity Sphere, has been crowned as Emperor of China. Shocking much of the nation with this obscene choice to allow a foreigner to sit on the Dragon Throne, many within Manchuria and the Fengtian Government have understandably voiced their opposition to the matter, but now it matters not. We must band together behind this new monarch if our righteous government has any hopes of surviving. Under the Shōwa Emperor and his noble regent who shall serve as his liaison and viceroy while Hirohito is at home in Japan, China shall enter a new age of prosperity as we cooperate with our Japanese neighbors for the benefit of all of East Asia."
fengtian.315.d_sad_yasuhito: "With the decision of the Concordia Association, Prince Chichibu Yasuhito, the second son of Emperor Taishō and regent to Emperor Shōwa, has been crowned as Emperor of China. Shocking much of the nation with this obscene choice to allow a foreigner to sit on the Dragon Throne, many within Manchuria and the Fengtian Government have understandably voiced their opposition to the matter, but now it matters not. We must band together behind this new monarch if our righteous government has any hopes of surviving. Under the direct rule of Yasuhito, China shall enter a new age of prosperity as we cooperate with our Japanese neighbors for the benefit of all of East Asia.
fengtian.315.d_kotohito: "With the decision of the Concordia Association, Prince Kan’in Kotohito, relative of the late Emperor, has been crowned as Viceroy of China. Shocking much of the nation with this obscene choice to allow a foreigner to sit on the Dragon Throne, many within Manchuria and the Fengtian Government have understandably voiced their opposition to the matter, but now it matters not. We must band together behind this new monarch if our righteous government has any hopes of surviving. Under the direct rule Yasuhito, China shall enter a new age of prosperity as we cooperate with our Japanese neighbors for the benefit of all of East Asia.
fengtian.315.a: "The Marquis of Extended Grace finds his throne, finally."
fengtian.315.b: "And so more of Asia falls under the sway of the Rising Sun"
fengtian.315.c: "The Qing dynasty is reborn under our banner"

fngdynasty.1.t: "The Question of the Nobility"
fngdynasty.1.d1: "As we establish ourselves we have come across another question, what to do about our potential nobility. We have a variety of options to choose from. Some argue we should uplift loyal locals to reward them for their faithful service though this does present the risk that they could undermine our rule in the future. Others argue that we should return the nobles of the old Empire to their rightful place. Few of them are left, but their children are still scattered across the nation. If we give them back what is due it would breed a gentry loyal to us and us alone. More radical heads argue that any nobility would be a vector for corruption and we should have only the throne as the sole authority."
fngdynasty.1.d2: "As we establish ourselves we have come across another question, what to do about our potential nobility. We have a variety of options to choose from.

If we give them back what is due it would breed a gentry loyal to us and us alone. More radical heads argue that any nobility would be a vector for corruption. Alternatively we could just bring over some lesser nobles from the home islands."
fngdynasty.1.a: "Let us uplift the loyal as our new gentry."
fngdynasty.1.b: "Returning the old nobility shall prove our benevolence"
fngdynasty.1.c: "Our Emperor's rule needs no scheming nobility outside of the royal family."
fngdynasty.1.e: "Nobles from the home island shall make fine aides."

fngdynasty.2.t: "Imperial Examinations"
fngdynasty.2.d: "The Imperial Examinations are an ancient and proud Chinese tradition to find the best of the best prospective bureaucrats. As we spread our administration across the land its been suggested we bring these Examinations back. Linking our administration to the imperial era would bring us some much needed legitimacy and help create an efficient administration. Some have however come out against them, saying that while rigorous the examinations were not foolproof and reviving them now would not only bring back a long dead institution for no reason, but doom us in the longer term. Despite our pointed ignoring of the situation the debate refuses to go away, so we must decide."
fngdynasty.2.a: "The Imperial examination is backwards and outdated."
fngdynasty.2.b: "Adopting a compromise shall grant us long term gains."
fngdynasty.2.c: "Revive the examinations, Only the finest shall serve"

fngdynasty.3.t: "Fuse the Administrations?"
fngdynasty.3.d: "We are now at a pivotal crossroads to our administration. Japanophiles in our administration have begun urging us to link ourselves irrevocably to Tokyo. They claim that our two nations, united and free, can stand against Western Imperialism more effectively. They have produced messages from Tokyo showing that all they are waiting for is our approval to begin integrating our two administrations into one. Meanwhile in the halls of power shouting matches have become commonplace. While Japanophiles, backed by the Association, have pointed out the sheer power a unified Japan and China would hold, the rest of the court, from moderate voices to the few anti-concordia voices still present have at least urged restraint in considering such a audacious move so soon after the establishment of the Emperor's rule, as an attempt at being integrated into Japan outright could prove disasterous with our still unstable rule. They cite that Chinese dissidents, of which there are no shortage, still engage in anti-foreigner activities in cities like Wuhan, Tianjin and Shaanxi, and such a move could not only embolden them but bolster their popularity among the population."
fngdynasty.3.a: "The status quo suits us just fine."
fngdynasty.3.b: "The Emperor must rule his Empire directly."

fngdynasty.4.t: "Going Beyond the Middle Kingdom"
fngdynasty.4.d: "We have already staked our rightful claim over the lands of the Middle Kingdom, a great victory, and one well earned. But this is not enough, the achievement of casting down warlords will be modest compared to our further exploits. We look beyond the mongol steppe, the mountains of yunnan, and see a world which was once ours to protect and rule."
fngdynasty.4.a: "We claim the territories once owned by our Jurchen predecessors."
fngdynasty.4.b: "The Buryats of the steppe are part of China's rightful claim."
fngdynasty.4.c: "Sinitic peoples everywhere as well belong under our righteous rule."

fngdynasty.5.t: "Words from the Son of Heaven"
fngdynasty.5.d: "Since the Emperor of Japan took his place on the Dragon Throne, assuming the Mandate of Heaven so long held by the Qing, much of the Chinese people, from ideologues to peasants thought him an invading usurper no better than the Mongol or Manchu. In the face of this foreign Emperor, whispers and murmurs of resentment passed from lips as often as rice. As part of frequent attempts to combat this discontent, addresses by the Emperor were not uncommon, speaking words to the nation in his native Japanese, followed by an interpreter in Mandarin. However this morning, when Hirohito spoke to the nation from the Palace of Heavenly Purity within the Forbidden City over the radio, most expected the Northern or Coastal accent that was typical from such addresses. They were pleasantly surprised, if not amazed, to hear Mandarin accented with Hirohito's style of speech, float through the radio, this once foreign Emperor was speaking to them in their own language. It appeared to them that the Japanese Emperor had finally made an effort to be a truly Chinese Ruler in more than just name. While Dissidents and rabble rousers alike were quick to suggest that his way of speaking hinted at him only being made to speak the language phonetically whith no actual knowledge, their cries fell by and large on deaf ears, as for the first time since the Yamato family claimed the mandate, the whispers permeating the nation had if only for a small, tentative moment, become colored with hope rather than bitterness."
fngdynasty.5.a: "No better proof that our empire is true to its people."

fngdynasty.6.t: "Two Empires under Heaven"
fngdynasty.6.d: "Today newspapers accross China spoke of the young Emperor Prince Akihito attending Chinese lessons at a School in [Capital.GetName] accompanied by his regent Yasuhito. Also reported was that [FNG.GetLeader] himself had also taken up the language, allegedly releasing a declaration written entirely in Mandarin celebrating China’s ancient history and urging peace and unity between the Chinese and Japanese peoples. These dual showings of respect for Chinese culture have impressed the nation. While there are still those who see the Yamato Dynasty as little more than usurpers, claiming that such actions are mere facades to give the illusion of benevolence, the displays have endeared many, bringing the young regime over China a step closer to true stability. While both Akihito and Yasuhito have decided to keep their primary residence in Tokyo, the government has also announced that the young Emperor will live part time in Beijing, sowing the seeds for the young emperor to become a symbol of unity as an Emperor the Chinese and Japanese alike can be proud of..."
fngdynasty.6.a: "Two Brother Nations, United Once More!"

fngdynasty.99.t: "Our Flag"
fngdynasty.99.d: "Now that the Concordia Association has decided to crown Emperor Shōwa to the Dragon Throne, we must now face the question of our flag. The current design displays the Imperial Seal of Japan over the banner of the Chinese Empire, but the second design depicts a similiar design but makes a heavier emphasis on Japanese symbolism. We now must decide which banner we must continue to adopt for our new Empire."
fngdynasty.99.a: "Keep the current design."
fngdynasty.99.b: "We could use a different design."

fngdynasty.100.t: "The Matter of the Far-Eastern State"
fngdynasty.100.d: "Ever since the Tsars of old drove their subjects to expand the influence of Russia ever eastwards into Siberia the Chinese sphere of influence to the North has been dramatically constrained. No better an example is there of that than the very existence of what is commonly known as 'Transamur', but officially the Far Eastern Republic of Transamur. A pitiful state born from the dictatorial ambitions of one man and the aftermath of internal Russian strife, it stands on the grounds stolen from the Chinese nation by general Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky and the Treaty of Aigun of 1858. With the implicit blessing of the Sun Emperor of Japan himself, we have carte blanche for demands against their previously favoured Russian warlord, many in our army are eager to wipe away that humiliation and retake ancestral Chinese territories."
# Only one question remains before our own Heavenly Sovereign, how far shall the banners go?
fngdynasty.100.a: "The Treaty of Aigun is dead and Muravyov-Amursky rots, Outer Manchuria shall be ours!"
fngdynasty.100.b: "Let us drive further and subjugate Buryats, the last remnants of the Genghisid Confederacy!"

fngdynasty.101.t: "The Emperor Protects but the Empire Strikes"
fngdynasty.101.d1: "Since the Emperor of Japan took his place on the Dragon Throne, assuming the Mandate of Heaven in the lands of the Middle Kingdom, the leadership of China beneath him has assumed that they possess carte blanche to grab at whatever territories they please. To this end, we have recieved demands for Outer Manchuria, a wound that evidently has not healed in their estimation even after 80 years. Even under the Japanese thumb, or perhaps even because of it, the strength of the reborn Japanese Empire of China is not to be taken lightly, and we should consider whether our pride is worth a formidable land war in Asia of an unseen scale."
fngdynasty.101.d2: "Since the Emperor of Japan took his place on the Dragon Throne, assuming the Mandate of Heaven in the lands of the Middle Kingdom, the leadership of China beneath him has assumed that they possess carte blanche to grab at whatever territories they please. To this end, we have recieved demands for Outer Manchuria, a wound that evidently has not healed in their estimation even after 80 years. Being under the nominal direct control of our Japanese Allies, this may be a nightmarish situation for us if we come to blows, but we have the silver lining of a direct diplomatic line to Tokyo, whether we pull them in or deal with this ourselves, the question cannot wait."
fngdynasty.101.a: "Let them have that far eastern wasteland."
fngdynasty.101.b: "We are not so easy to push around, refuse."
fngdynasty.101.c: "The Emperor must hear of our plea!."

fngdynasty.102.t: "The Reclaimation of Manchuria"
fngdynasty.102.d: "Today the nation rejoices, after a near century of seperation and imperialist exploitation, the whole of Manchuria is returning to our realm, another step towards correcting the unequal treatiers and age of humiliation. Upon the confirming of the territory beign ceded, troops rapidly marched into the area to secure the area, assisted by the Japanese general Yui Mitsue. While many Russians had already begun resettling for Russian lands, whether soldier's families following their departure, or assumed they would be subject to expulsion or even violence, those that remain have been assured that little harm will come to them, should they give us no cause to do so, a direct request from Tokyo, and a sign of our righteous intent"
fngdynasty.102.a: "An injustice stricken, a land restored."

fngdynasty.103.t: "[FROM.GetName] Defies our Claim!"
fngdynasty.103.d: "In bombastic defiance, the [FROM.GetName] has refused our claims to Outer Manchuria, whether they underestimate our might, or vice versa, our general staff regardless call for a general mobilization to enforce our claims on Manchuria. Though we had wished to avoid costly bloodshed, it appears that there is little choice."
fngdynasty.103.a: "We shall see 1858 avenged."

fngdynasty.104.t: "Manchurian Dispute against [FROM.GetName]!"
fngdynasty.104.d: "It seems that after offering our Emperor the Mnadate of Heaven, our nominal territory of [FNG.GetName] has assumed licence to expand itself against our ally in [FROM.GetName]. Claiming outer Manchuria for themselves, [FROM.GetName] has reached out to us in order to mediate, hoping to preserve our alliance, and hopefully, their territory. While it remains tempting to hand over such land over to our subjects in [FNG.GetName], it may put our alliance with [FROM.GetName] at risk, a decision must be made, and carefully."
fngdynasty.104.a: "The Emperor favors his own, Manchuria belongs in his hand."
fngdynasty.104.b: "Such rash action is unwise, withdraw such claims."

fngdynasty.105.t: "The Japanese Turn against us!"
fngdynasty.105.d: "Despite our honest effort to have the Japanese bring their "subjects" in [FNG.GetName] to heel, it seems they have not neglected to do so, as we initially feared but affirmed such claims against us! This has only emboldened the [FNG.GetName] who continue to press for Outer Manchurian lands. If we refuse at this point, it is probable we will have to depart Japan's alliance, a dangerous suggestion at the best of times considering the might of the potential enemy at our door."
fngdynasty.105.a: "It is not worth it, cede the territory"
fngdynasty.105.b: "This is our land, and it shall remain ours."

fngdynasty.106.t: "The [FROM.GetName] Deny us!"
fngdynasty.106.d: "When we levied the demand for our rightful clay of Outer Manchuria, our nominal allies in the [FROM.GetName] sought to convinve Tokyo to favor them over us, predictably, unwilling to intervene against a new, massive facet of the Emperor's subjects, our claims were now directly backed with Japanese steel. However, in outrage, the [FROM.GetName] has announced their departure of the Co-Prosperity sphere over the matter whether they underestimate our might, or vice versa, our general staff regardless call for a general mobilization to enforce our claims on Manchuria. Though we had wished to avoid costly bloodshed, it appears that there is little choice."
fngdynasty.106.a: "So bold and so foolish."

fngdynasty.107.t: "Japan Intervenes for [FROM.GetName]"
fngdynasty.107.d: "When we levied the demand for our rightful clay of Outer Manchuria, our nominal allies in the [FROM.GetName] sought to convinve Tokyo to favor them over us. Now word from the home islands has revealed that they have gotten their way, unwilling to jeopardize the membership of [FROM.GetName] in the Co-Prosperity sphere, our claims had been shot down, at least in the case of [FROM.GetName]. With the direct disapproval of the Emperor's government, we now have little way to reclaim the land in question."
fngdynasty.107.a: "How humiliating."

FNG_MAD_CLAIMS: "Declaration of Expansionism"
FNG_MADDER_CLAIMS: "Declaration of Rampant Expansionism"

fngnap.1.t: "A New Empire?"
fngnap.1.d: "Following the attempted assassination of Zhang Zhuolin, what was the most tension filled period in our government as we awaited to see if he would recover has now turned into our favor, as upon him walking out of the field hospital along with his retinue, the nation exploded in support and fervor towards his reign. Close friend and trusted advisor of Zhuolin, Zhang Zouxiang, has proposed to Zhuolin behind closed doors that perhaps now is a once in a lifetime opportunity to achieve the grandest ambitions in all of China, in becoming Emperor of China, but where Yuan Shikai failed in holding onto the mandate of heaven, Zhuolin could succeed. By managing a referendum where the population voted in favor of Zhuolin as their Emperor, not only would it give us a true claim Mandate of Heaven, but also the unambiguous support of the people, and show to the entire world that Zhuolin’s Fengtian government has more legitimacy than any other warlord holding on with military might alone. However, of course this claim on the Imperial throne would be a audacious move, and perhaps the risk of swerving away from the long standing republican pretense in Fengtian would be more risk to Zhuolin’s life and legacy than it is worth."
fngnap.1.a: "A new Empire will have the favor of Heaven above and men below"
fngnap.1.b: "We are best served by the status quo"

fngnap.2.t: "A Referendum for Empire"
fngnap.2.d: "Much to the dismay of Republican elements within the government, Marshal-President Zhang Zhuolin has announced that in the coming days and weeks, a referendum on the status of the Republic is to be held. While coming as a shock to the average peon, whom had come to know the President as a champion of Republican values, this is far from the case. While he may have played up Republican ideals and led the third fall of the Qing dynasty, the President has always been something of a monarchist. Indeed, it was the monarchist Zhang Zhuolin whom aided and provided support for the rabidly monarchist Mad Baron of Mongolia. The referendum itself is to be a simple affair, with two options, either the maintenance of the Republic or the restoration of Empire. President Zhang has all but said that if Empire does return to China, it shall be himself that is crowned Emperor, making many in the press harken the referendum to the 1852 referendum in France where Louis Napoléon Bonaparte was voted to be Emperor. Republicans throughout China have denounced the move, calling it an attempt to emulate Yuan Shikai with extra steps. Already, several groups, have taken to the streets, calling for the referedum to be cancelled, or even for the Grand Marshal to step down. Regardless, the future of the Republic shall soon be decided, the fate of Empire is directly in the hands of the people."
fngnap.2.a: "Here's to a clean referendum!"

fngnap.3.t: "The Mandate Reborn"
fngnap.3.d: "The momentous day has finally come and the people of China could manifest their deepest will and desire, the Sovereign of Heavens is back in the Middle Kingdom. What was decried by his opponents as surely the final moment of a power grab, the referendum constituted by Zhang Zuolin was an overwhelming success. The popular masses in amounts unseen by any provincial democratic experiment yet in the history of China came out in droves to make their voices heard and grant the Dragon Throne to the man who dragged their beloved nation from the dirt of the 20th century. Despite the result in favour of Zhang and against any republican mirage account for nearly 80% of the votes cast murmurs of supposed 'rigging' or 'intimidation' are still spread around major cities. While some western observers blindly believe those fabrications and spread them all over their papers, it is nothing more than pure propaganda from bitter failures, ones that would see Zuolin's project for a renewed China stopped just because of their personal hatred against the new Emperor. Yet they are a mere minority, although vocal and annoying, for peasants and intellectuals of our nation widely accept the results and are ready to pledge their loyalty to their new Sovereign."
fngnap.3.a: "Now, where could my crown be?"

fngnap.4.t: "Zhang Zhuolin, Emperor of China!"
fngnap.4.d: "An atmosphere of heightened breath is what has taken the forbidden city and its surroundings as crowds await the announcement that the entire nation has been waiting upon. Zhang Zhuolin has decided upon the path that will bring order and stability to wider China in a period where those two necessities have been painfully lacking, and thus took up the offer to take the mandate of heaven. Now his son Zhang Xueliang and his troops keep a watchful eye over the crowds that stand in awe outside the forbidden city’s chambers, watching from a distance to the square where vast portraits of Zhuolin stand sentinel over the massed crowds  of Zhuolin’s trusted advisors, Fengtian dignitaries, foreign journalists and even local elders from Manchuria. Suddenly at the chime of a new hour on the clock, an official hushes the vetted crowd, and silence grasps the onlookers as they watch Zhuolin march onto a Dais and take a seat upon the long cold throne of China. Stepping to the slow pace of a drum, an official steps forth with a crown on a pillow and upon reaching the foot of the dais, asks Zhuolin if he sees himself worthy of the Mandate of Heaven, and the responsibility of leading the middle kingdom with it into the future. Upon answering that he is worthy, the official kneels before him and offers him the Crown, and Zhuolin takes it, thus beginning his reign with the era name of Emperor Hongzhi, meaning "Great governance". \n\nWith the formalities over, Zhuolin addresses the crowd and thus, the wider realm of China and the world as to why he saw the need for the restoration of heaven’s mandate over China. That it was decay that had doomed the Qing to being puppets of the legations and later the Germans, that it was decay that had lead to the absolute chaos that resulted in brother turning upon Brother in the battles of petty warlords and hyena’s of society, and now it was decay that was leading to China being circled by foreign powers like a corpse is by vultures. That only he, now known as Emperor Hongzhi, was the one who stood to these forces of nature, ambition and external threat alone, and thus was granted the mandate to restore China to it’s rightful glory that has been so sorely lacking this new century. \n\n With that speech finished, Zhuolin retired to his winter residence to the cheers of his loyal followers for the night, a night marked by fireworks brightening the sky above Peking as a new age shines upon China."
fngnap.4.a: "A cold mandate, finally given to one deserving"

fngnap.11.t: "Zhili Defections"
fngnap.11.d: "The Zhili Clique has begun to collapse as the news of our decision to uphold the ideas of the Xinhai Revolution spread across China. From Beijing to Nanjing, Zhilli loyalists of all kinds now jump ship from the sinking Qing dynasty, hoping to ride new waves of success and glory in the wake of resurgent Xinhai Democracy. All along the way, they have vitriolically denounced the Qing and everything they stand for, citing their numerous failures and inability to preserve Chinese nationhood and importance on the international stage. Now, as these defectors cross the border North into our Lands, maybe we shall be able to capitalize on such a shift."
fngnap.11.a: "Lets hope they will prove useful."

fngnap.12.t: "Political Reshuffling in Beijing"
fngnap.12.d: "With the arrival of the Zhili defectors, along with the Zhang’s de jure declaration of a constitutional monarchy, the political scene in our clique have begun to shift wildly. The Democratic Constitutional Party, the Socialist Party of China, and NCERA all have merged into the China Democratic Socialist Party as a way to present a stronger political front against the Zhili arrivals. Meanwhile, the Socialists who now have become alienated and pushed to the fringe by this new Democratic Socialist coalition reacted, moving to form the Zhongguo Guojia Shehui Dang (Chinese National Socialist Party) with the aid of a myriad of smaller radical groups. Seeking to form a bulwark against this rising Leftist wave, the Young China Party - a nationalist Han and Manchu group formerly active within the Zhili Clique - have coalesced into an organized party once more here in Manchuria in order to safeguard their nationalist, conservative interests. All in all, the political landscape of our Fengtian has rapidly evolved and metamorphosed over these past months. Now, let us see how this affects the national political scene. formerly in the Zhili government once again coalesces as a nationalist force in politics."
fngnap.12.a: "Never a dull moment in Chinese politics."

fngnap.13.t: "A United Front?"
fngnap.13.d: "To end any possibility of the political turbulence in China from getting out of hand, a proposal has reached the Emperor's court to unite the parties into one big tent coalition which will be easier to exert political force on. While some loyalists extolled the virtues of this idea, citing that it would consolidate more power in Zhuolin's reliable hands, reformists decried that it would destroy the genuinity of the Fengtian democracy. More pragmatic officers point out that such an action mirrors the decision by Yuan Shikai to consolidate supportive parties under his monarchy, which could prove controversial under that light. Zhang Zhuolin must walk a delicate path here as he tries to further consolidate China within his grasp."
fngnap.13.a: "A China divided politically, will soon be divided by warlords!"
fngnap.13.b: "Our firm hand will keep them in check just fine"

fngnap.14.t: "Election Day"
fngnap.14.d: "For the first time in our new imperial system, national elections are to take place. These shall determine which party shall rule underneath the Emperor, helping to guide the nation under Zhuolin’s divine grandeur. Though our politics have shifted massively in recent months, quite a few parties were able to organize, and now it is finally time to decide the future direction of our new constitutional monarchy. May the best men win!"
fngnap.14.a: "The Imperial League remains dominant"
fngnap.14.b: "The CDSP emerges triumphant"
fngnap.14.c: "The Democratic Constitutionalists are victorious"
fngnap.14.e: "The YCP bests the competition"

fngnap.31.b: "We must focus on developing the countryside"
fngnap.31.c: "A balanced approach is best"
fngnap.31.e: "Raw Resources will be China's engine toward prosperity"

fngrebels.1.t: "The Flight of Zhang Xueliang"
fngrebels.1.d: "After the Concordia Association took over Fengtian, Zhang Xueliang escaped capture and fled into the wilderness. Since then we have had our police and military spreading across the vast Manchurian plains searching for him. We had begun to give up hope of finding him when we received a report from the Great Wall. A guard post near the Wall was waving through a group of travelers when they recognized Zhang among them. When approached, Zhang took off on his horse, aiming to lose the officer in a nearby woodland, however as the guard pulled his pistol, Zhang did the same. When the crowds had dispersed and the smoke had cleared the gruesome truth became clear..."
fngrebels.1.a: "...Zhang’s corpse lay on the ground, a bullet piercing through his back."
fngrebels.1.b: "...the officer lay dead, bleeding from a hole in his temple."

fngrebels.2.t: "The Flight of Zhang Xueliang"
fngrebels.2.d: "The celebrations of the death of Zhang have been cut short today when troubling news arrived. Police from across our country had spent most of the day confiscating pamphlets from the Han Chinese nationalist organization the Huanghanhui. They claim that the Association are little more than a thinly veiled Japanese occupation and not the rightful rulers of Fengtian, much less China. They also call on all patriotic Han to rise up in the name of the martyred Zhang Xueliang. We have ordered all these pamphlets to be seized and burned lest any malcontent locals get any ideas."
fngrebels.2.a: "Who would waste time reading this glorified tantrum."

fngrebels.3.t: "Anticitizen One"
fngrebels.3.d: "As if the news of Zhang’s escape wasn’t troubling enough, pamphlets have popped up across China. They claim to be from the Han nationalist organization Huanghanhui who claim a new leader, Zhang Xueliang. This has deeply troubled our nation as while he is disgraced from power he remains a powerful symbol of Han unity, especially against the creeping Japanese influence. If he really had escaped to lead this new nationalist movement theyt may prove to be a substantial threat should they ever find more purchase with the populace."
fngrebels.3.a: "What is this tabloid trash?."

fngrebels.4.t: "Huanghanhui Surge"
fngrebels.4.d1: "In the months after the escape of Zhang, the Huanghanhui have yet been tireless in their efforts to slander our rule and agitate our fair rule, however it seems in recent months their numbers have seemingly surged, malcontents and radicals crawling out of the woodwork even in our capital, they say our blatant lack of any attempt to adapt our administration to the image of the old empires and the influx of foreign nobles proves that our rule is nothing but a colonization effort of China, around every corner are posters and pamphlets extolling the martyrdom of Zhang Zuolin as a hero of China, murdered by Japanese blades."
fngrebels.4.d2: "In the months after the death of Zhang, the Huanghanhui have yet been tireless in their efforts to slander our rule and agitate our fair rule, however it seems in recent months their numbers have seemingly surged, malcontents and radicals crawling out of the woodwork even in our capital, and just this morning a shocking new development has appeared, it appears that nativist and traditionalist monarchists, though previously supportive of the establishment of monarchical rule, have defected to the Huanghanhui's ranks!, citing the blatant foreign nature of our administration and nobility they have openly announced support for a truly Chinese empire to expel the invaders, rallying around the figure of the Marquis of Extended grace as the successor to the last Han Empire."
fngrebels.4.a: "Oh dear."

fngpolitic.1.t: "The Recovery League Nominates a New Foreign Minister"
fngpolitic.1.d_Wu: "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Wu Jinglian, former speaker of the Beiyang Assembly, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Wu has served in the position before, and is known for his fierce opposition to the regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] monarchy, though he has also been an outspoken critic of Japanese involvement in China. As a result, he could be a vital asset in the propaganda war against [QIE.GetAdjective], or a substantial inconvenience in our complicated relationship with Japan.\n\nWu's extant ties to the Foreign Ministry and its importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision rests with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.1.d_Wang: "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has set its sights on the office of the Economic Minister, proposing Wang Yitang as a replacement for its current occupant. Wang has some history in the Northeast, and served in Jilin at the start of his career, but ultimately his loyalties lay with the Anhui Clique. With their collapse, his return to the Northeast in 1927 was purely pragmatic. Now a member of the Recovery League, this nomination alongside his extant role as Minister of Foreign Affairs seems to be evidence of his growing power within the party more than any particular fiscal or financial merit. Thanks to the Recovery League's strong position in government, only the Grand Marshal himself can stand in the way of his appointment."
#"Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Chang Chun, a prominent politician with close ties to Huang Fu and the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. Having studied at the Tokyo Shinbu Gakko before the Revolution, Chang can be said to have a working understanding with the Japanese while still remaining distant from the Concordia Society, making him especially well suited to manage the complicated relationship between our two governments.\n\nThe Recovery League's ties to the Foreign Ministry means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the Grand Marshal can veto the decision at any time."
fngpolitic.1.d_Huang: "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Huang Fu, former Speaker of the Assembly, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. His reputation as a man of character makes him well suited to to the task, but his resolute republican values have made his relationship with the Grand Marshal one of cooperation against mutual enemies, and he will undoubtedly react poorly to further consolidation of the Grand Marshal's already sweeping powers.\n\nHuang's prominence and the Foreign Ministry's importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision will be made by the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.1.d_Huang_hog: "Feeling confident in their growing influence in government, the Recovery League has proposed Huang Fu, our current Speaker of the Assembly and Head of Government, as a replacement for our current Minister of Foreign Affairs. It is not unheard of for especially powerful politicians and warlords to consolidate power through occupying multiple posts, and his reputation as a man of character makes him well suited to deflect suspicion and accusations of misappropriated power. All the same, his resolute republican values have made his relationship with the Grand Marshal one of cooperation against mutual enemies, and he will undoubtedly react poorly to further consolidation of the Grand Marshal's already sweeping powers.\n\nHuang's prominence and the Foreign Ministry's importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision will be made by the Grand Marshal."

fngpolitic.2.d_Pan: "With the Foreign Ministry firmly under their control, the Recovery League has set its sights on the office of the Economic Minister, proposing Pan Fu as a replacement for its current occupant. Pan is known to be an experienced in the role, having served both under the Beiyang Government and our own, but during that time he built up an unfortunate reputation for shady dealings and corruption. He has yet to be convicted of any crime, and it's even possible that these widely held suspicions are unfounded, but his past seems likely to haunt him if he reoccupies his old post.\n\nDespite the risk, the Recovery League's advantage in government means that only the Grand Marshal can prevent his appointment."

Wang has some history in the Northeast, and served in Jilin at the start of his career, but ultimately his loyalties lay with the Anhui Clique. With their collapse, his return to the Northeast in 1927 was purely pragmatic. Now a member of the Recovery League, he no doubt hopes for a return to prominence within Zhang's government, though his close ties to the Japanese continue to raise some eyebrows. Of course, Wang remains a respected politician, and the Recovery League's strong position in government means that only the Grand Marshal himself can stand in the way of his appointment."

fngpolitic.3.d: "Following some necessary political maneuvering, the Recovery League has nominated Jin Yunpeng as a replacement for our current Interior Minister. Jin is known to be capable, as he was once a high-ranking member of the Anhui Clique, and in the years since 1927 he has served as one of the Recovery League's more prominent members. However, his rivalry with the Communications Clique's leader Liang Shiyi is well known, and should the two come to serve together in government there is every chance of friction and perhaps even open conflict. Some are also reluctant to trust such a prominent member of the former Anhui Clique in such a high office.\n\nShould either prove too concerning, the Grand Marshal could of course prevent the appointment."

A native of Fengtian province, Lu oversaw the sale of Transamur's portion of the Chinese Eastern Railway to Fengtian in 1927, and has been Chairman of the Board ever since, marking him as a significant figure of opposition to Mantetsu, while conveniently allowing him to amass a great deal of personal wealth.\n\nThe Communications Clique's extensive connections to the Commerce and Financial Ministries makes this appointment relatively easy, and the transition smooth, leaving the Grand Marshal with the sole choice of whether or not to approve the appointment."
fngpolitic.4.d_Li: "Thanks to their growing strength in government, the Communications Clique has nominated Li Shaogeng to fill the position of Economic Minister. Granted the role of Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929, Li has never been particularly outspoken or charismatic, but maintains an intricate network of back-channels and secret agreements with low level officials and bureaucrats across the Northeast. His most important relationships, however, are with the railway unions, which work with the Communications Clique to oppose Mantetsu and Japanese influence in return for rights, benefits, and control over the workplace.\n\nLi is known to be silently competent, but the Grand Marshal can always choose to prevent the appointment."

While he retains pro-Japanese sentiment, he appears to have made genuine efforts in the years since to distance himself both from his decision and his Japanese connections.\n\nAll the same, his power within his party is second only to its leader, Liang Shiyi, and his talents are many.

While he retains pro-Japanese sentiment, he appears to have made genuine efforts in the years since to distance himself both from his decision and his Japanese connections.\n\nAll the same, his power within his party is second only to its leader, Liang Shiyi, and his talents are many. He may be appointed or turned away at the Grand Marshal's leisure."

Comparatively young by Fengtian Government standards, Li has spent most of his adult life occupying one position or another beneath Zhang Zuolin, but his appointment as Minister of Transport in 1929 led to his association with the Communications Clique and his middling post within their ranks.\n\nWhile not of particularly high prestige, Li has deep roots in Fengtian Province, and his unconventional position between the Communications and Zhang Cliques makes his status unusual, for better or worse. His appointment depends only upon the Grand Marshal."

Unlike many of his faction, Yuan is as much a bureaucrat as he is a soldier, with experience managing logistics in Heilongjiang, and his position on the Chinese Eastern Railway's board gives him ties to, and a rivalry with, the Communications Clique.\n\nWhile he and his faction proclaim absolute loyalty to the Grand Marshal, the more power they hold, the more the other factions grow restless, giving some reason at least for Zhang to possibly refuse to appoint Yuan."
fngpolitic.8.d_Ma: "Thanks to their increasing power in government, the Zhang Clique has moved to nominate Ma Zhanshan as Interior Minister. As a fellow 'Graduate of the University of the Green Forest', Ma shares something of a bond with Zhang Zuolin, and his masterful horsemanship and sharpshooting skills have turned him into something of a popular legend. However, this same background has left him illiterate, particularly hostile to the Japanese, and without any formal military training whatsoever.\n\nAlready, members of the other factions have voiced their complaints about the placement of a 'bandit lord' on the cabinet, even including some other members of the Zhang Clique, and it seems clear that the appointment was secured by Ma's patron Wu Junsheng.\n\nThe decision is left with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.8.d_Tang: "Thanks to their increasing power in government, the Zhang Clique has moved to nominate Tang Yulin as Interior Minister. Governor of Jehol, and promised rule of Chahar before his forces were driven out of it by Mongolian cavalry at the end of the last Zhifeng War, Tang is known to be something of an administrative blunderer, and his support for the Qing Restoration of 1917 has left him unpopular in some circles. As a result, his appointment seems likely to be a product of Clique internal politics, or merely well placed bribes funded by his considerable wealth.\n\nShort of any ill-advised attempts to open conflict over Chahar, or any administrative embarrassments, Tang stands to be a low-key minister unlikely to stir political competition.

Sun breaks from this trend however, in that he has both political and administrative experience, primarily in Jilin Province under Zang Shiyi.

While his lack of experience in economics may be a concern, Ruan is known to be diligent, and the Japanese Foreign Ministry's handling of events in Fengtian is notably more cautious than that of Mantetsu or the Kwantung Army.\n\nThe final decision ultimately rests with the Grand Marshal."
fngpolitic.12.d_Yu: "Thanks to their growing influence in government, the Concordia Association has nominated Yu Zhishan for the position of Economic Minister. An Army officer through-and-through, Yu takes a pragmatic approach to Fengtian's position visa-vis Japan, seeing it as the only way for Fengtian to defeat the South, and for China as a whole to retain its identity in the face of Western domination. With a great deal of experience managing supply lines and weapons production during the War, Yu is likely to pursue a policy emphasising military industrialisation, closely aligning his position with the interests of the Kwantung Army.\n\nThe final decision ultimately rests with the Grand Marshal."

fngshen.9.t: "Federalists Press for Reforms"
fngshen.9.d: "As expected from the Federalists, [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] has been attempting to pressure Zhang Zuolin to adopt reforms. The aim of these would be the gradual liberalization of [From.GetCliqueShortName] and ideally - for him - that these reforms at the head would trickle down to influence the other warlords as well. It's clear that the Federalists aren't prepared to support Zhang without getting something in return."
fngshen.9.a: "Make vague promises."

fngshen.10.t: "The Anti-Concessionist Question"
fngshen.10.d.ANQ: "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to make any definitive pledges on the matter so far, but that hasn't made the issue go away. It's evident that this won't last long if the conference is to move forward."
fngshen.10.d.GXC: "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. They've been supported in this endeavor by the Federalists, who are equally defiant against the Concessions albeit from a more liberal position. While Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to state an official position on the matter so far, he's likely to be forced to do so soon. As the influence that the two Chens wield is gaining momentum, this issue isn't likely to go away."
fngshen.10.a: "They might have a point..."

fngshen.11.t: "[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] Find Common Ground"
fngshen.11.d: "United by a staunch Anti-Concessionist platform, the two Chens of [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] have formed what's essentially a bloc in the conference. With broad support for their positions, Zhang Zuolin's undeclared position is becoming more and more untenable by the hour."
fngshen.11.a: "This may be a problem."

fngshen.12.t: "Zongchang's Drunken Rants"
fngshen.12.d: "After drinking Sake by what we can only assume to be the barrel-load, [SQI.GetLeader] has created a scene today as he slurred and yelled his way through a drunken tirade. What little could be understood of his ravings were nothing short of a love letter to Japan with only his love for Japanese booze and women being comprehended by the hostage audience, if only through repetition. Most of Zhang's incomprehensible ravings were, for better or for worse, impossible to understand, which may have been a blessing in disguise.\n\nAfter creating a spectacular scene, he got up on his chair and put one boot down on the table. Before he could be made to sit down again, he declared a toast to Japan, with the rest of his speech sounded more like a man struggling to hold back vomit than actual words. To say that this has created a negative atmosphere among the conference attendants would be the understatement of the decade."
fngshen.12.a: "Stop embarassing us!"

fngshen.13.t: "Yang Yuting Urges Caution"
fngshen.13.d: "With Anti-Concessionist sentiments rising, Yang Yuting has come forward to urge Zuolin to be cautious with regards to the stance on the Concessions. Because of Japan's strong interests in them, particularly through its China Agency in the Legation Cities, they stand to lose greatly if we went ahead and declared ourselves to be against the Concessions. Because of our healthy and mutually beneficial cooperation, alienating them would be seen by Tokyo as not merely an insult, but naked aggression against them.\n\nWhile hardly unexpected, Yuting's actions prove that Japan is worried about our eventual decision. If nothing else, it's a reminder that they will not sit idly by if we join the Anti-Concessionist movement."
fngshen.13.a: "A fair warning."

fngshen.14.t: "The Point of Decision"
fngshen.14.d: "Facing insurmountable pressure from his potential partners, Zuolin must decide whether he agrees to the Anti-Concessionist stance that has overtaken the conference or tries to argue against them. Siding against the Anti-Concessionists would severely hinder our chances of forming a strong alliance. Adopting an Anti-Concessionist stance, however, would severely anger Tokyo."
fngshen.14.a: "Very well, we accept."
fngshen.14.b: "We cannot afford angering Japan."

FNG_federalist_allies: "§GThe Federalists will join our efforts against [QIE.GetNameDef]!§!"
FNG_anticoncessionists_angered: "§R[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] will be greatly angered by this decision!§!"
FNG_federalists_angered: "§R[FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] will be greatly angered by this decision!§!"
FNG_anqing_angered: "§R[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] will be greatly angered by this decision!§!"

fngshen.15.t: "The Federalist-[FNG.GetCliqueShortName] Alliance"
fngshen.15.d: "It wasn't easy to overcome the numerous differences between us. In the end though, pragmatism won out and enough common ground was found to make this unlikely friendship a reality. [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] and the Federalists of [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] are now on the same side following a long series of secretive negotiations. Let us hope that this alliance stands the test of time."
fngshen.15.a: "Excellent."

fngshen.16.t: "[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] Thanks Us"
fngshen.16.d: "We've received official word from [ANQ.GetLeader] that they are happy we took an Anti-Concessionist stance. However, they have not yet weighed all the matters concerning their decision to join us in our Reclamation War. We await their final decision."
fngshen.16.a: "We'll have to wait."

fngshen.17.t: "End of the Conference"
fngshen.17.d: "Although there was no shortage of hurdles to overcome along the way, diplomacy has won the day. The Shenyang Conference has ended in a success for [Root.GetCliqueShortName], cementing their position in the region at the expense of the Beijing government. The delegates left the city after a cordial closing ceremony. Zhang Zuolin is now several steps closer to turning his ambitions into reality."
fngshen.17.danq: "Although there was no shortage of hurdles to overcome along the way, diplomacy has won the day. The Shenyang Conference has ended in a success for [Root.GetCliqueShortName], cementing their position in the region at the expense of the Beijing government. The delegates left the city after a cordial closing ceremony. It is now up to us if we will indeed put our weight behind Zhang Zuolin and join his Reclamation War."
fngshen.17.a: "Next stop: Beijing!"
fngshen.17.b: "We'll make the right decision."

fngshen.18.t: "The Federalists Storm Off"
fngshen.18.d: "Finding a compromise on the Concessions proved to be an insurmountable task. It was simply politically impossible for the Federalists to make a complete U-turn on the matter, while Zhang's refusal to budge is being publicly mocked as a simple refusal to bite the hand that feeds it. After publicly denouncing the conference as a sham, the Federalist delegation led by [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] left the conference. Any chance for an alliance between them and [Root.GetCliqueShortName] is now likely an outright impossibility."
fngshen.18.a: "This will be trouble."

fngshen.19.t: "Zuolin Refuses Our Demands"
fngshen.19.d: "Evidently, Zuolin simply could not bite the hand that fed him. By declaring his opposition to the anti-Concessionists, he's showed his colors for all of China to see. There's absolutely no way we can side with [From.GetCliqueShortName] under these circumstances. While we'd hoped that he'd see reason, we can't say we're surprised either. Our delegation left the conference earlier today, leaving Zuolin with his Japanese cronies."
fngshen.19.a: "What to expect from a Japanese puppet?"

fngshen.20.t: "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Refuses to Denounce the Concessions"
fngshen.20.d: "Despite our best efforts, our delegates could not convince Zuolin to stand against the concessions. We'll not let this go lightly, but we must not commit any rash actions and immediately denounce Zuolin. Let us look at the factors and decide whether or not to join Zuolin in his Reclamation War against Beijing."
fngshen.20.a: "Unfortunate."

fngshen.21.t: "Tiaoyuan Decides His Position"
fngshen.21.d: "The [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] stance on the Concessionist question greatly angered [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName]'s Chen Tiaoyuan. However, [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegates have informed us that the decision whether or not they will join our war against Beijing and enter into an alliance with us has yet to be made. We eagerly await their final answer."
fngshen.21.a: "We must be patient."

fngconf.1.t: "A National Reunification Conference"
fngconf.1.d: "Having broken through the Shanhai Pass, our army sent shockwaves across the nation when they seized the city of Beijing, and once again the Five Color Flag flies above the city! With this victory we have taken the first major step toward national reunification, and resumed our role as an active contender for national leadership.\n\nIntending to seize the moment, Marshal Zhang has ordered his staff to begin assembling a plan for the peaceful unification of China. If put into motion - and more importantly, agreed upon - it would see the remaining provinces in China united without any further bloodshed, raising the legitimacy of our government immeasurably. The plan is not without its opponents, of course, as some politicians doubt an undertaking of this scale can be accomplished, while some members of the military believe that diplomacy will only prevent the formation of a strong central authority and leave the country again united in name only.\n\nWe must carefully consider this decision, as the stroke of a pen here could have a far bigger impact than any order the Old Marshal has given in his long and storied career."
fngconf.1.a: "Send the invites!"
fngconf.1.b: "Only the sword can unite China!"

fngconf.2.t: "Attend the National Reunification Conference?"
fngconf.2.d: "Having seized Beijing and raised the Five Color Flag above its walls, the Fengtian Government has taken its first major step toward its planned 'reclamation' of China, and resumed its role as an active contender for national leadership. Its leader, Marshal Zhang Zuolin, has called for a national conference to discuss what he calls 'the peaceful unification of China'. Supporters of the notion emphasize unity in the face of Western imperialism, whereas the detractors cite everything from Zuolin's dependence on Japanese support to the very structure of the Fengtian Government.\n\nPast disagreements and disputes aside, the fact that the winds are blowing in Zhang Zuolin's direction means that we wouldn't lose face by attending, but simply attending might grant him legitimacy."
fngconf.2.a: "Yes, we will attend."
fngconf.2.b: "This is a waste of time."

FNG_betrayal_tooltip: "§RAs a declared ally of Fengtian, not attending the conference will be seen as tantamount as abandoning Fengtian.§!"

fngconf.3.t: "Denounced by [QIE.GetNameDef]"
fngconf.3.d.zhili: "To the surprise of no one, the warlords who foolishly bet on the Zhili are denouncing our attempts to unite China under our banner, citing every ridiculous reason between heaven and earth to justify their allegations against us. If they aren't calling us warmongering criminals, they're accusing us of merely being Japanese cronies. Evidently, they're far more interested in bickering over what they lost when the Zhili fell from prominence rather than uniting for the good of China."
fngconf.3.d.manchu: "To the surprise of no one, the warlords who foolishly bet on the Manchu are denouncing our attempts to unite China under our banner, citing every ridiculous reason between heaven and earth to justify their allegations against us. If they aren't calling us warmongering criminals, they're accusing us of merely being Japanese cronies. Evidently, they're far more interested in bickering over what they lost when the Manchu fell from prominence rather than uniting for the good of China."
fngconf.3.a: "We expected no different."

fngconf.4.t: "The Enemy to the South"
fngconf.4.d: "In response to our recently announced plan to hold a conference for the unification of China, a Kuomintang representative has publicly denounced us and declared that the party will boycott our initiative. Denouncing us as warlords, bandits, and Japanese running dogs, they're already calling the conference illegitimate and intend to ignore whatever negotiated document it might produce. It should surprise no one that the radicals whose only goal is to uproot all of China's traditions and culture have no interest in seeing reason."
fngconf.4.a: "We expected no different."

fngconf.5.t.JAP: "The Conference in Beijing"
fngconf.5.d.JAP: "We have received word that our friends in Shenyang are arranging a conference aiming to unite China under the Fengtian Government. With the winds clearly blowing in his direction, Zhang Zuolin believes that this is the best opportunity to pull the country together, as no one else can legitimately claim to be able to fill the power vacuum left in the wake of former Beijing government's collapse.\n\nSubsequently, we need to decide what our role in the conference, if any, should be. While we naturally cannot be represented by regular delegates, many in the Foreign Ministry have suggested that we should demand observer status. While we would not have any voting rights, some are arguing that our presence would support claims that Zhang Zuolin is operating at our behest, and thus undermine both our positions in China. The rest, however, seem to agree that our reasons to attend are legitimate, and that we shouldn't be held captive by the irrational fears of Chinese nationalists. After all, should this conference begin to develop in a direction contrary to Japanese interests, it would be best to know first hand - and perhaps to tip the balance in our favor."
fngconf.5.a: "Demand observer status."
fngconf.5.b: "Don't bother."

fngconf.5.t.FNG: "Japan Demands Observer Status"
fngconf.5.d.FNG: "The Japanese ambassador recently contacted us with a polite but firm request to lead an observer delegation to the National Reunification Conference, insisting that they merely intend to oversee the development of Asian affairs at this historic turning point. We, of course, will welcome our friends from Tokyo with open arms."
fngconf.5.c: "Very well, take a seat."

fngconf.6.t: "Invite Chen Jiongming?"
fngconf.6.d: "Chen Jiongming is one of relatively few individuals who can claim to operate at the highest level of national politics, and from his stronghold in the south he's remained the federalist movement's leading figure for over two decades. Chen Jiongming's ideals and our government's practices have relatively little in common, but there is room for compromise. Chen's presence would grant the federalists a major say in the conference's outcome, but not allowing him to attend could make the process seem illegitimate to some."
fngconf.6.a: "Send the invite."
fngconf.6.b: "Don't bother."

fngconf.7.t: "Invite Song Qingling?"
fngconf.7.d: "The third wife of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling has previously served as the leading figurehead for the Left-Kuomtintang, and granted the movement her husband's legitimacy even beyond his deathbed. With her organization militarily defeated, Song could pass the same legitimacy on to us, if at the cost of some concessions to her socialist ideals. Nontheless, members of the Concordia Association, the Communications Clique, and even some of the Old Marshal's loyalists are urging us not to invite such a radical firebrand into our midst."
fngconf.7.a: "Send the invite."
fngconf.7.b: "Don't bother."

fngconf.8.t: "Japan Lodges A Complaint"
fngconf.8.d: "An official from the Japanese embassy in Shenyang has lodged a formal complaint on behalf of the government in Tokyo, expressing displeasure with our decision to invite 'radical' elements to the conference. He noted that Japan hopes this 'mistake' will not lead to any disruptions in the otherwise 'cordial' Sino-Japanese relationship. Be that as it may, we'll go ahead with matters as planned."
fngconf.8.a: "Let them shout."

fngconf.9.d.conference_fails: "The planned Unification Conference fails before it can even begin, as most of China has refused to even engage in diplomacy with Fengtian."

fngconf.10.t: "The National Reunification Conference Begins"
fngconf.10.d: "With the arrival of the delegates, the Reunification Conference has officially started with an opening ceremony befitting such a landmark event. After a brief address by the Old Marshal himself, welcoming those attending and underscoring the importance of this historic gathering, the delegates took to their seats. While a promising start, the negotiations over the coming days will no doubt be challenging."
fngconf.10.a: "Let's begin."

fngconf.11.t: "Tiaoyuan's Speech"
fngconf.11.d: "In Beijing, one of the key moments on today's agenda was a speech given by Chen Tiaoyuan, the former governor of Anhui Province who rose to prominence during the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. He congratulated the Fengtian government's efforts under [FNG.GetLeader] to resist German imperialism, as well as their many lackeys who put the interests of foreigners ahead of fellow Chinese, but warned that he expects the same stubborn resistance against any other foreign aggressors. The speech was met with applause from every corner of the chamber, though some interpreted the speech as a subtle criticism of Zhang Zuolin's ties to the Japanese."
fngconf.11.a: "Well spoken."

fngconf.12.t: "Question Of The Constitution"
fngconf.12.d.federalist: "As the conference started, the first order of this day was the proposed creation of a new constitution. The proposal would clearly outline the rights and powers given to both the people and the government, but not everyone is pleased. Chen Jiongming has expectedly proven a full-throated critic of the proposal in its present form, which he claims would grant too much power to the nation's executive. Instead he would prefer the restoration of the suspended 1923 constitution, which is widely considered China's most liberal to date. The federalist bloc quickly lined up behind Chen, and this will no doubt remain a thorny issue as the conference goes on."
fngconf.12.d.no_federalist: "As the conference started, the first order of this day was the proposed creation of a new constitution. While it may not be what everyone wanted, it seems to be something everyone can agree on, or at the very least accept, as it clearly defines the rights, powers and limitations set on the government's branches. After some debate and a few proposed amendments, it seems like it's broadly being agreed upon. Some commenters have noted that the relative equanimity shown is a sign that few present plan to follow the constitution's actual tenets in the long term."
fngconf.12.a: "The debate begins."
fngconf.12.b: "Interesting."

fngconf.13.t: "Disagreements With The Federalists"
fngconf.13.d: "Disagreements over the constitution have been center floor to the confernce virtually since its start, and now the Federalists have been joined by other delegates who, while they may not share the same concerns as the Federalists, have used this opportunity to get some of their more minor concerns addressed.\n\nWhile they would likely have accepted the proposed constitution it as it was, the staunch opposition mounted by the Federalists over this issue has allowed them to join forces and form a sizable albeit informal opposition bloc in the conference halls, large enough to hold up the rest of the conference. It would seem that proceedings have stalled until either side budges or offers a compromise."
fngconf.13.a: "We need a solution."
fngconf.13.b: "This could be a problem."

fngconf.14.t: "A Compromise Is Proposed"
fngconf.14.d.FNG: "After days of vigorous debate, a compromise was finally reached reached between the parties, which they're now presenting to us. The 1923 constitution will be broadly restored as it is but with clear checks on a weakened executive along with a centralized army. To accept this compromise Chen Jiongming demands the position of Prime Minister under Zhang Xueliang as President. Under this proposal, Zhang Zuolin would also get the title of Grand Marshal of the army.\n\nWhile it's a tough pill to swallow, it's unlikely that we'll get a much better deal out of them. As such, many in our camp are suggesting that we accept it as even a handful of defections could give their bloc a majority. Others are, however, insisting that we should call the Federalists bluff and that Chen's demands to be the prime minister are unreasonable. How should we act?"
fngconf.14.d.others: "After days of negotiations, a compromise has been reached. The restoration of the 1923 constitution will go ahead with more checks on the executive and a centralized army. Under this deal, Jiongming will be the Prime Minister under Xueliang as President. This army will be headed by Zuolin as Grand Marshal.\n\nWhile it isn't something everyone's happy with, it's hopefully something that everyone can agree on. We now await the response from Fengtian."
fngconf.14.a: "Very well, we have a deal."
fngconf.14.b: "This is unacceptable!"
fngconf.14.c: "Sounds like a nice idea."

fngconf.15.t: "The Federalists Leave The Conference"
fngconf.15.d.rejected: "With the constitutional compromise rejected, we expected the Federalists to come forward with a more rational proposal that wasn't a naked power grab by Chen Jiongming. Unfortunately, they returned after some deliberations by declaring to everyone that they were abandoning the conference while denouncing the Fengtian leaders. A portion of the conference hall is now glaringly empty without their presence. While certainly not ideal, the conference can at least go on without any further interruptions." #Non-Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.rejected_feds: "With Fengtian refusing to budge on the implementation of the 1923 constitution without watering it down, the Federalists have given up on trying to negotiate any further. After denouncing Zuolin's refusal to compromise, their bloc of delegates promptly left the conference hall and are already on their way out of Beijing. Though the conference continues, the numerous vacant seats in the chambers have left a scar on its legitimacy." #Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.betrayed: "Despite their differences a compromise between Zhang Zuolin and Chen Jiongming's Federalists might have been possible, but it was not to be. Ironically the point of contention was not ideological in any form, but instead territorial. Fengtian promised Federalist territory to another claimant, hoping to bring them on board, but in doing so Zhang unintentionally destroyed any goodwill between himself and his Federalist negotiating partners. Furious, they are already on their way out of the city." #Non-Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.betrayed_feds: "Despite our differences, a compromise with Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Government might have been possible. But, now it is clear that such dreams were simply never meant to be. In a brazen act of betrayal Zhang promised portions of our territory to another claimant, and in so doing proved himself no better than any other predatory warlord. We cannot accept such an insult, and our delegates are already planning to leave the conference tomorrow." #Federalist POV
fngconf.15.a: "Their loss."
fngconf.15.b: "This doesn't bode well."

fngconf.16.t: "Song Qingling Takes the Floor"
fngconf.16.d: "With her very presence at the conference controversial, the Kuomintang luminary's speech was inevitably going to draw a lot of attention. Despite the total defeat of her organization militarily, her late husband's legacy still carries with it the sympathies of many republicans and intellectuals across the country, making her support a valuable commodity - especially for Zhang Zuolin, who continues to seek external legitimacy. Predictably, Song Qingling denounced the inability of previous regimes to address the real wants and needs of the population, and declared that any truly legitimate Chinese government must succeed where its predecessors failed. Her words drew some polite applause from other delegates, but there's no doubt that her eventual proposed reforms will prove controversial with the more conservative delegates."
fngconf.16.a: "Let's see what she proposes."

fngconf.17.t: "The Sanmin Negotiations"
fngconf.17.d: "Most warlords have had a shaky relationship with the ideology of Dr. Sun Yat-sen both before and after his death in 1925. Several, including Zhang Zuolin, have at times claimed to be inheritors of his legacy, keen to draw support from his former adherents despite their own indifference to the ideas themselves. Now, however, Zhang may have to pick a side a stick with it. Among Song Qingling's demands are the formal adoption of the Three Principles of the People, which in theory would force Zhang to turn his back on the Japanese, implement democratic reforms, and commit to widespread social programs.\n\nReality suggests compromise as the only route forward, and fortunately the principles are open to interpretation. Already the Fengtian camp has indicated its willingness to support the first and third of the three principles, if the second is only nominally implemented. Zhang will promise to take a hard-line with the Japanese, fund some of Song's welfare initiatives, and place his son Xueliang as President of the Republic, so long as real power remains in his hands via the military."
fngconf.17.a: "An acceptable offer!"
fngconf.17.b: "A ridiculous proposition!"
fngconf.17.c: "Watch this closely."

fngconf.18.t.success: "The Four Principles Of The People"
fngconf.18.d.success: "Negotiations were tough, but in the end both parties' willingness to compromise prevailed. The promised ascendency of Zhang Zuolin and his son Xueliang has been seen by conservatives as a sufficient safeguard against radicalism, and a sign that while times are changing China's traditional values will be respected rather than uprooted.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the negotiations ended with Song expressing her gratitude towards Fengtian for their willingness to cooperate and compromise. She has pledged her personal support for Zuolin's initiative to unify China, handing him a powerful tool with which to curry legitimacy on the national stage."
fngconf.18.a: "Excellent."

fngconf.18.t.failure: "Divided Over Principles"
fngconf.18.d.failure: "Evidently, the number of social and political reforms required to appease Song Qiongling has proven too bitter of a pill for Fengtian and its allies to swallow, while Song herself refused to 'desecrate' the legacy of her husband with the aims of an upstart warlord and former bandit.\n\nSubsequently the negotiations ended in failure, and Song Qingling promptly left Beijing and returned to China's political wilderness. While it may not be a huge surprise that this wide ideological rift couldn't be bridged, it's nonetheless a blow to the idea of Chinese unity and Zhang Zuolin's quest for national legitimacy."
fngconf.18.b: "Her loss."

fngconf.19.t: "The Promise of Anti-Concessionism"
fngconf.19.d.ANQ: "As the conference has continued, the matter of the foreign concessions has hung over proceedings like a dark cloud. In principle all factions are united in their opposition to foreign imperialism. However, virtually all parties at the table have had dealings with foreigners in the past, and none more closely than Zhang Zuolin, whose administration in Shenyang has been beset by the stark realities of Japanese power for some time. Zhang may be openly opposed to Western imperialism, but even now Japanese observers are privy to the unification conference's every debate and back-room deal.\n\nNow Chen Tiaoyuan of Anqing, who has built his political platform on anti-concessionism, privately 'reminded' Zhang Zuolin of his earlier promise to denounce the concessions. It seems like this issue will need to be addressed sooner rather than later."

Zhang may be openly opposed to Western imperialism, but even now Japanese observers are privy to the unification conference's every debate and back-room deal.\n\nNow the Federalists led by Chen Jiongming have publicly demanded that Zhang Zuolin openly denounce Japanese imperialism, just has he has the Western powers. The public nature of Chen's demands has put the Old Marshal in a tough spot, and it seems like the matter cannot remain unaddressed for much longer."
fngconf.19.a: "Another debate begins."
fngconf.19.b: "Japan might not like this..."

fngconf.20.t: "The Anti-Concessionist Debate"
fngconf.20.d: "While they don't always see eye-to-eye on matters, the topic of Anti-Concessionism has brought together the two Chens of the conference. Anqing's Chen Tiaoyuan and the federalist Chen Jiongming have found common ground in their opposition to the concessions and have formed a united bloc. Led by these two strong voices, the anti-concessionist side made a very strong showing in the debates, winning over many uncommitted delegates to their side."
fngconf.20.a: "This might be a problem."
fngconf.20.b: "Another heated debate?"

fngconf.21.t: "Song Supports Anti-Concessionism"
fngconf.21.d: "Never a friend of colonialism at home or abroad, everyone expected Song Qingling to fully support the Anti-Concessionist stance. Although she has been careful not to disturb her carefully negotiated deal with Zhang Zuolin, Song has quietly helped build an anti-concessionist consensus behind closed doors. Pressure will only continue to build on Zhang and his government to break with Japan."
fngconf.21.a: "She might have a point..."

fngconf.22.t: "The Point of Decision"
fngconf.22.d.FNG: "Concessions to foreign powers have predictably become a major point of contention for all parties attending the National Reunification Conference in Beijing. While most delegates have now called for a commitment to abolish the concessions, and refuse any further commitments, we remain the only major player in attendance that has yet to publicly take a side on the matter.\n\nIt's no secret that we owe a debt of gratitude to Japan for all the help they've given us. By joining the anti-concessionists, we would be directly opposing our nominal friends in Tokyo, and the act would constitute a betrayal in many eyes. Be that as it may, by declaring our opposition to the anti-concessionist cause we would severely undermine our legitimacy and give ammunition to those that wish to paint us as mere puppets of the Japanese. The Old Marshal must now make his choice and do his best to navigate the inevitable consequences his fateful choice."
fngconf.22.d.others: "Concessions to foreign powers have predictably become a major point of contention for all parties attending the National Reunification Conference in Beijing. While most delegates have now called for a commitment to abolish the concessions, and refuse any further commitments, Fengtian remains the only major player in attendance that has yet to publicly take a side on the matter. Zhang Zuolin now faces a very difficult choice as the voices calling for him to join in with the anti-concessionist movement grow louder with each passing hour. Silence or refusal will no doubt lend credence to claims that Zhang is nothing more than a Japanese stooge."
fngconf.22.a: "Denounce the concessions!"
fngconf.22.b: "We cannot anger Japan."
fngconf.22.c: "A point of no return."

fngconf.23.t: "Danger In The Beijing Conference"
fngconf.23.d: "In a most shameful display, Zhang Zuolin has bowed to pressure from anti-foreign forces within China. In denouncing our benevolent efforts to protect and uplift China in the face of Western Imperialism, Zhang has shown his true colors. This impertinence, this insolence in the face of our long-standing military and economic cooperation is an insult without compare!\n\nDespite warnings from some in the Foreign Ministry against a rash response, broad swathes of the military and political establishment are demanding an immediate response, with some hard-liners even insisting that we use our remaining influence to send Zhang an ultimatum forcing him to reverse course."
fngconf.23.a: "Demand they reverse course."
fngconf.23.b: "Do nothing for now."

fngconf.24.t: "A Strongly-Worded Letter"
fngconf.24.d: "It didn't take long for Tokyo to respond to our decision to side with the anti-concessionists. A letter has arrived from the Japanese embassy demanding that we reverse course on our new anti-concessionist stance at once, and make an immediate public apology for our 'shameful insolence'.\n\nIf we do not accept, the response from Tokyo is likely to be scathing. If we back down now however, there is not a soul in China that will see this as anything other than a betrayal to foreign interests."
fngconf.24.a: "We have no choice. Back down."
fngconf.24.b: "No, the humiliation ends here."

fngconf.25.t: "Zhang Zuolin Backs Down"
fngconf.25.d: "Finally seeing reason, Zhang Zuolin has backed down in the face of our just demands that he cease his cowardly betrayal of our shared interests in China. While this might make things more difficult for him politically within China, we could never permit the subversion of our larger aims, which take into account the fate of all East Asia."
fngconf.25.a: "We'll have to keep an eye on him."

fngconf.26.t: "Fengtian Reverses Course"
fngconf.26.d: "Where it seemed as if Zhang Zuolin had made the courageous decision to resist Japanese imperialism by denouncing the foreign concessions as we requested, he has now reversed course. We should have expected this kind of two-faced behavior from a former bandit, and now he has gone so far as to issue a public apology to the Japanese Emperor! Truly, he has chosen a path of cowardice and infamy, to which he will no doubt be condemned to the end of his days. If Zhang cannot peel away Japan's grasping hand, we will have to do it for him. There can be no other answer to this outrage than to depart the conference in its entirety."
fngconf.26.a: "He was Japan's puppet all along!"

fngconf.27.d.feds_song: "Where it seemed Zhang Zuolin had made the decision to resist Japanese imperialism by denouncing the foreign concessions, he has now reversed course. As expected, Chen Jiongming's Federalists were the first to storm out of the conference in a rage, decrying Zhang's duplicity and naming him a Hanjian - a race traitor. Song Qingling and her small delegation quickly followed suit, and those who remained were left with the difficult choice of whether to follow themselves. Zhang's move will prove highly unpopular across the board, though Japanese backing does, of course, come with its own rewards."

This puts us in a difficult position, as anti-concessionism has formed the core of our credibility among the people, but Fengtian has been our primary sponsor. Already Chen Jiongming's federalists have denounced the move and declared their intent to depart the conference. Pressure is now mounting on us to do the same."

Surprising many however, his statements have escalated into a full-throated denunciation, capped by a declaration that he intends to leave the National Reunification Conference entirely. With Song Qingling already declaring her intent to leave, this is a major blow to Fengtian's power and prestige, depriving Zhang of a key ally and leading many to question the validity of the conference at all. Zhang's remaining supporters have been quick to point out that Chen also owes his position to Fengtian's aid, and blame this disaster upon the machinations of the radical Song - an Empress Nanfeng for a new age!"

However, he has stopped short of electing to leave the conference entirely, which has been interpreted by most at the conference as a sign that this is ultimately a face saving measure and little more. Fengtian has been Chen's main sponsor, and breaking away from his protecting umbrella would not only leave Anqing adrift, but also leave its expansive coastal regions vulnerable to a Japanese invasion.\n\nChen's words are fierce, but may end up more bark than bite."

fngconf.32.d.failure: "With more and more delegates abandoning the conference, it wasn't long before the empty seats were in the majority. By this point, it's clear to any honest observer that nothing decided here will matter, as the conference has been sapped of its legitimacy. Even internationally, it's being mocked in the press as yet another floundering attempt at unification, and Zuolin himself as yet another figure in the long line of failed, self-serving Chinese strongmen.\n\nRealizing that the conference is now indelibly stained, it was with a heavy heart and great disappointment that Zhang declared the conference to be a failure, and committed to uniting China by the sword."
fngconf.32.d.cancelled: "After Zhang Zuolin's untimely passing, many wondered if the initiative for a unified China that he led would die with him. Today the answer to any such speculation came as his successor, the Kwantung-backed Yang Yuting, called off the conference with immediate effect and declared any prior decision to have come out of it to be null and void.\n\nWhile Japan's role in this seems obvious, there's nothing to be gained from pointing fingers now. The attempt to unify China peacefully has died along with Zuolin, and there likely won't be another chance to do so without bloodshed for years to come."
fngconf.32.d.beijing_lost: "A tense atmosphere had grown with each day as hostile forces marched closer and closer to Beijing. For a conference aimed at uniting China by the pen rather than the sword, its entire legitimacy was cast into doubt once the Fengtian Army began to retreat, ceding more and more land until Beijing itself became the front line. As the situation worsened, the city itself became a battlefield, and the wounds caused by the last battle over the ancient city were quickly reopened as gunfire and shelling marked its streets.\n\nEven before the enemy entered the city, measures were taken to evacuate the delegates, and it wasn't long until these hastily drawn evacuation plans had to be put into effect. By the end of the same week, the Fengtian Army had been chased out of the city.\n\nThe conference collapsed before the city fell, and with it disappeared any hope of the participants returning. Needless to say, this has been a profound humiliation for Zhang Zuolin. Not only has the unification initiative been an utter failure, but his armies were routed from one of the great cities of Asia while the whole world watched."

Some were happier than others with the deals that had been made, but everyone's aware of the fact that they've made history today. As the closing ceremony took place, the Fengtian marshal held a speech where he expressed his sincerest gratitude to the participants for their hard work through the trials and tribulations that the conference had posed. Indeed, they'd all managed to prove to the world that the Chinese were able to come together, put their differences aside, and work for a better tomorrow.\n\nAfter defying the odds, there's little doubt that [FNG.GetLeader] will go down in history for this historic feat.

fngmil.0.t: "Shart Monday (The Poopenfarten Incident)"
fngmil.0.d: "After a long night of dining in Berlin’s most extravagant foreign restaurants and hard drinking in some of the new Disko clubs that have popped up within the city, Volksführer Joseph Goebbels returned to his opulent study in order to recharge with some Pervitin before taking on the new day of tackling his duties of running the Volksreich. However, his plans were interrupted when he was stricken by intense and unceasing bowel pain, causing him to run to his private lavatory. Within the black marble, red velvet, and gold-trim decorated water closet, our proud and noble Volksführer was reduced to the visage of a barnyard animal as he wrestled with the spicy ethnic food doing battle with his stomach and lower gut. \n\nMinutes turned into hours in that bathroom, and Goebbels’ stomach pains only grew worse as an unending hurricane of half-digested asian cuisine slurry was expelled en masse from our Volksführer along with an ever-increasing amount of blood. Fearing he had eaten some rancid food, or perhaps was even poisoned, Goebbels began to panic as he sat glued to his porcelain throne releasing a torrent of foul fluid. If he was not found soon, our Volksführer will likely die from whatever ails him, alone in that overly-decorated and now rancid powder room."
fngmil.0.a: "Shame. Have the Brown Shirts clean up this mess and make Rohm the new Volksführer."
fngmil.0.b: "His guards find the messy scene just in time and save the Volksführer’s life!"

fngmil.1.t: "Philopon for Military Use?"
fngmil.1.d: "In 1919 the Japanese chemist Akira Ogata invented one of the world's most potent synthetic stimulants, Methamphetamine, the commercial version, Philopon, has seen popularity in the Japanese populace as a dietary, antidepressant, and asthma treatment, congestion treatment, and productiveness enhancing medication. Since Mantetsu and Japan took root in Fengtian, this lucrative good's production had found it's way into our nation. Recently it had come to our attention that one of our highest performing units had been making judicious use of this stimulant to enhance their otherwise unremarkable combat performance, which has raised the idea among our general staff to introduce it's use into normal combat units, however it has been noted that Philopon is highly addictive, and controversy has been raised at the unusually ghoulish appearance in those soldiers who use it, as well as an unusually high rate of health related casualties and misconduct, not to mention the political ramifications of China's difficult history with opioids."
fngmil.1.a: "The cost is too high, these addicts are unfit to serve China."`
fngmil.1.b: "It’s uses are incredible, but we must give it only to men of the highest will."
fngmil.1.c: "With this new marvel, every soldier shall be a squad unto themselves."

fngmil.11.t: "An Avenue of Attack"
fngmil.11.d: "As the time to strike the Zhili comes ever closer, our command staff, well aware that the Zhili armies are not the same beast of yesteryear have been grappling with an overall strategy by which we can approach an offensive upon Beijing. Two main tactical phiosophies have thus made themselves known, one is a stretegy of a patient and methodical advance, scouting every detail of a single objective before seizing it in a perfectly executed plan under optimal conditions, repeating across the front until invariably that objective becomes the gates of Beijing. The leading alternative proposes the application of a concentration of force, achieving local superiority at a point along the Zhili lines to seize victory before the enemy can act, relying on our ability to organize a concentrated offensive against the weakest points in the enemy line to take down the Zhili army."
fngmil.11.a: "The Patient hunter gets the prey"

fngmil.31.t: "Our navy's place in the Empire"
fngmil.31.d: "Our current fleets and naval staff cannot compare to Japan, many of our advisors say its a waste of resources to catch up when we can invest in a land comparative advantage, while a smaller minority cite the relative difficulty of adapting Japanese engineering and doctrine in a short period of time to our entire nation, and would rather we take steps to continue with our own way."
fngmil.31.a: "There be no equals to the Emperor's navy."
fngmil.31.b: "We do not need such tumultuous reforms, a simple refinement of technique is sufficent."
fngmil.31.c: "Let the home islands carry the day at sea, our resources are better used elsewhere."

fngmil.32.t: "A Fleet to Match Tokyo"
fngmil.32.d: "While it is beyond question that our fleets shall be renovated to match Japanese standards, there are grave disagreements on what direction exactly this reform should take, it is known that in Japan there were those that argued that the shipbuilding methods of Japan needed to be renovated to keep pace with superior western Production, and those that said that such a disadvantage in absolute production could only be rectified by focusing on the advantage they did have of superior quality, while our situation is somewhat different, near identical school of thoughts have made camp in our nation, ."
fngmil.32.a: "With enhanced efficiency and Chinese dockyards, every ship of the foe shall meet 2 of ours."
fngmil.32.b: "Every wave of the sea shall be covered by our steel or our fire."
fngmil.32.c: "The unmatched engineering of every vessel shall make the oceans our playground."
fngmil.32.e: "The wealth and might of China demands no less than absolute perfection in it's navy."

fngmil.33.t: "A Direction for the Army"
fngmil.33.d1: "With new army reforms under way, we have but to choose a way with which to strengthen our armed forces. While hardly radical, two broad schools of thought divide such an attempt. One is to go with strengthening the drilling and discipline of our troops, to perform better in combat accross the board, the other is to adapt to using a greater quantity of troops, adjusting logisitics and recruitent systems to levy China's natural wealth of manpower."
fngmil.33.d2: "With new army reforms under way, the home islands have sent us several advisors to lead the process, among them, two divergent visions have emerged. One is to levy the vast resource base of China to prepare a strategy reliant on combined arms between air and ground units, able to perform in spite of the rough terrain of asia. The other is to instill the kind of fanatical zeal that has become infamous among Japanese troops into our army, who will while lacking restraint, be more feroious in combat and resistance."
fngmil.33.a: "The status quo serves us just fine, we need only refine our discipline."
fngmil.33.b: "Our soldiers are already unmatched in number, all that is left is how to employ them properly."
fngmil.33.c: "The future Air and Land fields of warfare are inseparable, our ways should reflect this."`
fngmil.33.e: "Further Moral indoctrination, With the heart of a Dragon and Ferocity of a Tiger, our men shall be unstoppable."

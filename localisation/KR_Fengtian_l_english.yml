#Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Fengtian, known as the 'Three Eastern Provinces' during the Qing and Beiyang periods, were split into nine smaller sub-divisions in 1931 to aid governance and economic planning. The vast majority of Fengtian's industry and mineral wealth is concentrated in the South, while the central and Northern provinces are primarily agricultural. Jehol, to the Southwest of Liaoning Province, remained untouched by the reorganisation, but has suffered thanks to the end of rail traffic through the Liaoxi Corridor, which connected land transportation between Beijing and the Northeast. Thanks to the government's new initiatives incentivising development across the provinces, prosperity will surely increase, but serious structural issues remain, and may become problematic as a result of increasing disparity in development between the north and south.

#The 'Huanghanhui', or 'Imperial Han Society', have been found to be using bribes and threats of violence to coerce low-level members of the Assembly. Unfortunately this information has gone public, even as the Assemblymen in question have been removed from office, and local police pursue additional suspects.\n\nShortly after information regarding this incident was presented to Japanese authorities, Kempeitai agents were observed entering an enclosed compound outside Shenyang, and reports indicate gunfire was exchanged. Over a dozen bodies were removed from the premises, and it would be unwise to pursue this matter any further."

#"The Imperial Han Society, a secret society with a Han-chauvinistic ideology and uncompromising hate of other ethnicities, is believed to be behind a number of killings in Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. The targets appear to be more or less random, linked only by their status as ethnic Russians, Manchu, Koreans, and Japanese. Mantetsu and the Japanese Consulate are demanding investigations, and the Kempeitai have already carted away a number of suspects to an unknown fate."

After securing governorship of Manchuria, Zhang went on to fight a series of wars with the Anhui and Zhili Cliques, at times extending his influence as far south as Shanghai. Despite Zhang's best efforts an economically unstable home front, German intervention, and Wu Peifu's military genius have seen him again contained to the provinces north of the Great Wall. He has been stoking old ambitions ever since, converting his formerly regionalist administration into a bastion of republicanism, claiming direct lineage from the Xinhai Revolution. His actual commitment to democratic principles remains to be seen.\nDespite his poor literacy and lack of a formal education, the 'Old Marshal' is a capable and self-aware leader, happy to seek advice and delegate where necessary to cover his deficiencies. However, he is also known for a short temper and an unforgiving nature, readily holding deep grudges. Zhang is also sometimes greatly self-centered, formerly crashing the entire Northeastern economy to support his war efforts. And so, in ideological terms, he could be described as staunchly 'Pro-Zhang'."

### Focuses ###
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order:0 "Preservation of the Xinhai Revolution"
FNG_Preservation_of_the_Xinhai_Order_desc:0 "Ironically, Fengtian is the sole national government upholding the order established by the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, which called for the overthrow of the Qing and the establishment of a Republic. Although its republican commitments are questionable, and Southern reclamation is currently unrealistic, the government has loudly advocated both goals, as they foster domestic legitimacy."
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing:0 "Fuguo Qiangbing"
FNG_Fuguo_Qiangbing_desc:0 "Translating roughly to 'Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army', this proverb dates back to ancient legalist philosophers, but has been used more recently to inspire reforms in both Guangxu Era China and Meiji Era Japan. Now it is applied again in Fengtian, as the government seeks to modernise and eventually strike South against the resurgent Zhili Clique, and from there establish control over all China."
FNG_Open_the_Propaganda_Front:0 "Open the Propaganda Front"

#Suppress Regionalist Sentiment Branch

FNG_Suppress_Regionalist_Sentiment_desc:0 "For many years, Zhang Zuolin's primary political slogan was 'The Northeast for the Northeast', but when his ambitions turned toward Beijing, this regionalist message had to be set aside. Ever since, it has proven a thorn in the Grand Marshal's side, and many still espouse these old sentiments. The time has come to put the matter to rest once and for all."
FNG_Silence_Targeted_Subversives:0 "Silence Targeted Subversives"
FNG_Silence_Targeted_Subversives_desc:0 "The regionalist movement has never been organized, but it has received support from the local gentry, school teachers, and government bureaucrats. Some of these figures have become increasingly prominent, and by silencing them we may cut the head from the regionalist snake. Some can be bribed, and others can be threatened or fired - to say nothing of other persusaive methods."
FNG_Justify_Mass_Arrests:0 "Justify Mass Arrests"
FNG_Justify_Mass_Arrests_desc:0 "So long as the regionalist movement remains peaceful, we lack the institutional and public support to crush it decisively. By dispatching agents disguised as protesters we can push the movement toward violent means, cost them their public support, and then justify mass arrests."
#Enrich the Country Branch
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation:0 "Enrich the Country"
FNG_Enrich_the_Nation_desc:0 "Manchuria's strength lies in its bountiful natural resources, characterised by Japanese publications as a 'boundless cornucopia', and its deposits of strategic resources like coal and iron have been designated as of "world-class significance". With a little Japanese help, Fengtian can forge for itself both a prosperous future and a mighty war-machine!"
#Mantetsu Collaboration Section

FNG_Yalu_and_Songhua_Hydroelectricity_desc:0 "Manchuria's abundant coal deposits make for an excellent power source, but the strong currents of the Yalu and Songhua rivers could provide additional power at minimal expense. With Japanese expertise, we might harness these mighty rivers to power more homes and industry."

FNG_Japanese_Coal_Gasification_Methods_desc:0 "Japan's quest for crucial oil lead it to Manchuria, but now with disappointing results from prospecting, coal gasification seems the only logical path forward.

FNG_Yingkou_Commercial_Development_desc:0 "The port city of Yingkou serves as Fengtian's primary gateway to the world, and the second largest port on the Bohai Gulf after Japanese-controlled [GetDalianName].

Ideally this would be achieved solely by the Chinese people, but reality dictates that the Japanese will lead much of the path forward."
FNG_Wang_Yongjiangs_Legacy:0 "Wang Yongjiang's Legacy"
FNG_Wang_Yongjiangs_Legacy_desc:0 "Manchuria's transformation from a backward borderland into one of China's most prosperous regions owes itself to the work of Wang Yongjiang, Zhang Zuolin's late Finance Minister. Disgusted by the Grand Marshal's costly excursions south of the Great Wall in 1928, Wang resigned and died shortly thereafter, his work left unfinished. We must pick up where he left off."
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC:0 "Reorganise the NTC"
FNG_Reorganize_the_NTC_desc:0 "Founded by the Fengtian Government shortly after its creation, the National Transportation Commission serves as a planning board for infrastructure construction across the country.

FNG_Support_Sino-Japanese_Joint_Companies_desc:0 "A great number of businesses in Fengtian offer shares to both Chinese and Japanese, including the infamous Mantetsu, but relatively few Chinese have the funds to invest and as a result most joint companies are Japanese dominated.

FNG_Unification_through_Negotiation:0 "Unification by Negotiation"
FNG_Unification_through_Negotiation_desc:0 "Since 1911, all attempts to truly unify China by way of negotiation have met with failure, as divides have proven insurmountable. However, after so many years of conflict and division, with Beijing now unquestionably in the Grand Marshal’s hands, it may be possible to bring at least some of China’s parties and factions to the negotiating table."
FNG_Restore_1923_Constitution:0 "Restore the 1923 Constitution"
FNG_Restore_1923_Constitution_desc:0 "The 1923 Constitution was widely recognized as China’s most modern, but the sheer corruption of Cao Kun’s Zhili Clique made its proclamation ring hollow, and its implementation impossible. Since 1928, when Fengtian was passed the torch of Republicanism, the Constitution has remained suspended due to strategic necessity. The time has come to restore the old constitution and resume elections."

FNG_The_China_Welfare_Fund_desc:0 "Song Qingling, wife to the late Dr. Sun, is a figure around whom all Republicans can rally. In return for her political support, Mrs. Song has asked that [FNG.GetNameDef] make several guarantees in return.

FNG_Limited_Womens_Suffrage:0 "Limited Women's Suffrage"
FNG_Limited_Womens_Suffrage_desc:0 "Universal suffrage is a step too far, as gender roles are at the very foundation of any morally upright confucian society, but Song Qingling has demanded at least limited suffrage for women. With the right preparations made, women across the country will soon be able to vote in local elections, in spite of the move’s questionable popularity."

FNG_Revived_Rural_Reconstruction_desc:0 "The rural hinterland of China has been neglected for far too long. It is time to formulate a comprehensive plan to revive development in these areas in order to join them to the richer, coastal areas and bridge the urban-rural divide. Nationally organised public works programs, including the construction of additional canals and railways, should give a boost to this development."
FNG_Redefine_Provincial_Obligations:0 "Redefine Provincial Obligations"
FNG_Redefine_Provincial_Obligations_desc:0 "One of the promises made to Chen Jiongming by Zhang Zuolin was assurances that the new government would adopt federalist characteristics.

FNG_Building_the_Road_to_Federalism_desc:0 "Another promise made to Chen Jiongming was to approve the creation of democratically elected provincial assemblies, organized according to provincial constitutions.

FNG_Supress_the_Bandits_Collect_the_Harvest_desc:0 "The last time soldiers of the Fengtian Army entered the North China Plain, some units were encouraged to suppress banditry and assist in collection the seasonal harvest in return for lodgings and food. Where such amenities were normally simply seized, these tactics seem to have ameliorated local unrest and partisan activity. All commanders would do well to follow this example."

FNG_Crush_Flies_and_Capture_Pigs_desc:0 "Corruption and abuse of power have run rampant throughout China over the past several decades, and all levels of the Fengtian Government are complicit in this activity. In order to regain the public’s trust, some measure of law and order must be restored, and examples will be made of both low-level “Flies” and high-level “Pigs”, who have been greedily gorging themselves on the nation’s livelihood."
FNG_Expand_the_Baojia_System:0 "Expand the Baojia System"
FNG_Expand_the_Baojia_System_desc:0 "The Baojia System is an ancient method of social organization and military recruitment. Zhang Zuolin revived the practice several decades ago in the Northeast, and to great effect, but now the time has come to once again expand the system to the rest of China, where it has by and large fallen by the wayside."

FNG_Incorporate_Local_Patronage_Networks_desc:0 "There is more to every institution than meets the eye, and every good warlord builds his stronghold through a network of reciprocal partnerships negotiated behind closed doors. With the collapse of enemy authority, there are many such individuals and institutions without a clear place in the new order. There is every reason to begin incorporating these individuals into our own networks, where possible."

FNG_Broaden_the_Bingzhan_Network_desc:0 "The Fengtian Army has long been renowned for its outstanding system of logistics, allowing its soldiers to receive regular rations and ammunition where others are forced to forage or steal from peasants. A key component in the system are “Bingzhan” or logistics depots, which must now be built in recently conquered areas."
FNG_Reclaim_the_Railways:0 "Reclaim the Railways"
FNG_Reclaim_the_Railways_desc:0 "Mostly built by Western hands, or at the very least funded by foreign capital, China’s railways have always been seen as a symbol of imperialism. Many are still owned in part by the same American or European corporations which built them, and the time has come to formally reclaim these railways and solidify the Central Government’s control over its own rail network, no matter the cost."
FNG_Centralize_Provincial_Revenues:0 "Centralize Provincial Revenues"
FNG_Centralize_Provincial_Revenues_desc:0 "Perhaps the greatest source of disunity in China has been the decentralisation of the tax system, begun with the introduction of provincial “Lijin” transit tariffs in 1853. The new Central Government must limit provincial taxation, and reduce the percentage local authorities may keep for themselves. Otherwise, local governments will continue to deny the nation revenue."
FNG_Institute_Labour_Discipline:0 "Institute Labour Discipline"
FNG_Institute_Labour_Discipline_desc:0 "The industrial policy of our nation is being threatened by the increasingly divergent interests of industrialists, union leaders and workers. Unions serve only to divide, and creating distrust, forcing the leaders of our country to compromise.

FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best:0 "The Generals Know Best"
FNG_The_Generals_Know_Best_desc:0 "There is no doubt that a centralized army can serve as the foundation to a centralized state, but China's great size requires a different approach. For this reason, we will continue to appoint military governors.

FNG_One_Army_One_Republic:0 "One Army One Republic"
FNG_One_Army_One_Republic_desc:0 "If we are to learn a single lesson from over two thousand years of Chinese history, it is that when military force is divided, so too is the country. In order to build a unified China we must create a single army, beneath a single banner, at the direction of a single command structure. This measure will not be popular at any level of government outside the Cabinet."

Our few friends and allies will now rally behind us as we carry forth the Five Color flag, raising aloft a symbol that unites the hopes and dreams of all Chinese.

FNG_The_Question_of_the_Presidency_desc:0 "In Beijing, they say that when Zuolin stamps his foot the whole city shakes. Yet he is a soldier before a politician, and once no more than a bandit, making many question his suitability for the nation’s highest political office. With gossip already circulating about his advanced age, illiteracy, and vulgarity, his western-tutored son Zhang Xueliang may make a better choice, while Zuolin leads from the shadows."

FNG_Eliminate_Internal_Dissent_desc:0 "For many years the Fengtian Government has tolerated some measure of political plurality, with a variety of interest groups lobbying the government in return for promises and favors. Within Beijing in hand this system must come to an end. Subversive internal elements will be eliminated, and those that remain must toe the government line. There is no other way to govern a Chinese society."
FNG_Minde_Zhuyi:0 "Minde Zhuyi"
FNG_Minde_Zhuyi_desc:0 "Sun Yat-sen was right to call for the three principles. Yet, without morality, how could the people truly devote themselves to the nation? There must be a fourth principle, “People’s Morality”, based on Confucian principles in order to drag China away from the clutches of crime, and vice. Chief among these principles, of course, is appropriate deference to figures of paternal authority."

FNG_A_Father_to_the_People_desc:0 "While he may not be suited to the Presidency, the people must be taught to recognize the key role of Zhang Zuolin in our great strides towards unification, and toward an end to a century of national humiliation.

FNG_Chunchi-Xiangyi_desc:0 "It was once said that China and Japan are “as close as lips and teeth”, and today further integration can only mean further prosperity.

### New Fengtian Events ###
fengtian.1.t:0 "Rumors Incite Regionalist Uproar"
fengtian.1.d:0 "Although no plans have been made public, or even exist in anything approaching a final form, rumors have already begun to spread that the Fengtian Army is preparing to march south and conquer Beijing within the next month. The scattered news coming in from the south have inspired a potent mix of excitement and concern, and confrontations have already broken out in tea rooms, bars, and other public places between ardent nationalists and regionalist 'Dongbei Party' members.\n\nThe 'Dongbei Party' is not a political party in any real sense, and more a nickname applied by detractors to any espousing doubts about Zhang Zuolin's mission to reunite the country. A significant number of local officials and bureaucrats, including school teachers, share this kind of skepticism and have begun organizing protests criticizing what they view as a costly and unnecessary war.\n\nNaturally, the government will not refute the rumors, as that might free up Beijing's hand to intervene in the League Crisis."
fengtian.1.a:0 "Rumors can be dangerous..."
fengtian.3.t:0 "Regionalists Take Action"
fengtian.3.d1:0 "Shouting 'Donbgei weile Dongbeiren' or 'The Northeast for Northeastern People', protesters have gathered near the Grand Marshal's palace, in Harbin's Sophia Square, and outside Jilin's Medical College demanding an end to war preparations. Their numbers are not great enough to present serious problems, and police have already been dispatched to maintain order, but this is only part of an ongoing campaign which threatens to undermine public confidence in the regime. If the whole of the Northeast cannot be united behind the Grand Marshal's dream to reunite all of China, then how can it ever be realized?"
fengtian.3.d2:0 "protesters gathered again in several prominent locations in Northeastern cities. Their numbers were not great enough to present serious problems, but that did not stop police from cracking down hard, wading into the masses with clubs and rifle butts, and scattering fleeing protesters into crowded side streets. Angered by the violence, some 'Dongbei Party' members have already vowed to return in even greater numbers, but it is hoped that this quick and decisive response will deter all but the movement's hard-liners, making them all the easier to round-up and silence.\n\nMore concerning is talk among members of local trade associations, chambers of commerce, and town assemblies of a tax boycott. Unlike some of the young students, these older men remember the hard times late last decade when war expenditures outgrew the Northeastern economy and sent it into economic freefall."
fengtian.3.d3:0 "Despite efforts by the police regionalist protests have continued sporadically across the Northeast, and have been given further weight by support from local chambers of commerce, currency exchanges, and other business institutions concerned about the economic costs of a war to the south. While this currently appears to be posturing, there is no telling whether these groups will undermine the war-effort when the decisive moment comes, and while the public protests have yet to turn violent it may be only a matter of time. The sooner this problem is addressed the better."
fengtian.3.d4:0 "News of continued conflicts to the south have given the regionalist movement renewed momentum. Attempts at suppression have been continually hampered by the unwillingness of some sympathetic bureaucrats, police chiefs, and other officials to carry out their duties in full. Undoubtedly a complete effort will need to be made to root out these frustrating elements and restore order. As the public discontent continues the legitimacy and strength of our government is gradually sapped away."
fengtian.3.a:0 "Unfortunate"
fengtian.4.t:0 "Agent Provocateurs in Action"
fengtian.4.d:0 "Just as planned, our well-placed agents have successfully pushed some in the regionalist movement toward violence. Already increasingly violent protests have caused damage to public property, and reactions have been negative. It may only be a matter of time before we have the justification we need."
fengtian.4.a:0 "Excellent"
fengtian.5.t:0 "The Harbin Riots"
fengtian.5.d:0 "A protest rapidly escalated into an all-out riot last night, as protesters clashed with police in downtown Harbin. There have been fifteen recorded deaths, with unknown numbers of wounded on both sides, numbers possibly stretching into the low hundreds. Of particular concern is the Harbin Central Station which saw its front windows shattered, and its roof in flames. Damage to the station and several pieces of rolling stock have delayed travel along connecting rail lines, and the bureaucrats at Mantetsu have already registered their outrage.\n\nCleaning up this mess may take some time, but at least we now have a clear justification for action against the regionalist movement."
fengtian.5.a:0 "Good... and bad."
fengtian.6.t:0 "Mass Arrests Begin"
fengtian.6.d:0 "With the appropriate justification now in place, our dutiful police officers, with support from local militia and the Fengtian Army, have begun rounding up suspected protesters. The majority will eventually be sent home, but not necessarily in one piece. Hopefully, their imprisonment will serve as a message to the other protesters, and any sympathisers, that the government will no longer tolerate their subversion."
fengtian.6.a:0 "Good riddance"
fengtian.7.t:0 "An Offer from the Kempeitai"
fengtian.7.d:0 "The Kempeitai, the Japanese Army's extrajudicial police force, have taken note of our regionalist problem and come forward with a partial solution. With a wide network of informants, they claim to have information on a number of figures underpinning the regionalist movement - information they have volunteered. In response, we must provide intelligence on several anti-Japanese agitators and insurgents who have so far slipped through their fingers; not in the least due to our own interference. So far it has been convenient for us to keep in contact with these nationalists, pending cases where we need to push back against Japanese influence.\n\nIs this one of those cases? Or should we take the deal and offer these people up on a silver platter?"
fengtian.7.a:0 "Take the deal"
fengtian.7.b:0 "No thank you"
fengtian.8.t:0 "Regionalist Movement Suppressed"
fengtian.8.d:0 "The 'Dongbei Party', and the regionalist movement in general, have been suppressed at last. While this is not an end to regionalist sentiment in the Northeast, it may last for decades to come, but for now it has ceased to be a consideration as we turn our attention southward."
fengtian.8.a:0 "Progress."
#The Fate of Mantetsu Schooling
fengtian.9.t:0 "Picking up the Educational Slack"
fengtian.9.d:0 "Our targeted removal of regionalist 'Dongbei Party' school teachers and other intellectuals has predictably led to educational chaos and major research interruptions, but staffers at the Japanese Consulate have come forward with a possible solution. Mantetsu has long maintained a series of privately run schools originally intended for the sons and daughters of employees, as well as Japanese immigrants, which pride themselves on providing an education comparable to or even exceeding those available in the Home Islands. At our behest, the Japanese government might pressure Mantetsu to open these to the public and provide staff to fill temporary shortages.\n\nOnce we open the door to this kind of activity it will be very difficult to close, and these schools will almost certainly be used to spread Japanese culture and norms. We should consider carefully."
fengtian.9.a:0 "Decline the offer."
fengtian.9.b:0 "Accept the offer."
fengtian.10.t:0 "The Kimono Scandal"
fengtian.10.d:0 "Scandal! In a most unfortunate turn of events, the Grand Marshal's youngest daughter has been photographed wearing a Japanese Kimono during a photo-session at the Mantetsu-run 'Hokutou Kokuritsudaigaku' or 'Northeast National Academy'. Despite risk of arrest, word of the photo has already spread widely, along with a few copies of the image itself, though local and national news agencies know better than to print this defamation. Some agents in the military's intelligence branch speculate that the image was intentionally taken and spread by the Japanese as a means of punishing the government for recent actions, but no supporting evidence has emerged.\n\nThere is little question, however, that our enemies will use this opportunity to spread their nefarious propaganda."
fengtian.10.a:0 "What an embarrassment!"
fengtian.10.b:0 "Close the Mantetsu schools!"
fengtian.11.t:0 "Students Join the Youth League"
fengtian.11.d:0 "In an embarrassing and deeply damaging incident, a band of Chinese school children from Changchun recently announced their intention to join the Fengtian Youth League, which actively promotes Japanese interests in our country. Obviously their young minds are easily impressionable, but their parade through the streets of their home city, waving Japanese flags, has disgusted many and invited outright enmity towawrd the government. Parents weep, asking how their children could become so warped, and demand an alternative to these dangerous Japanese-run schools."
fengtian.11.a:0 "This is an outrage!"
fengtian.11.b:0 "Close the schools!"
fengtian.12.t:0 "Chinese Uniforms for Chinese Students"
fengtian.12.d:0 "After the demoralizing effects of our harsh but necessary crack-down on 'Dongbei Party' teachers, our Education Ministry has come forward with a new national school uniform. While this may seem like a small change, the uniforms are a symbol of Chinese independence and national identity stretching beyond any particular region. Surely a bright new future awaits our students as part of a united China!"
fengtian.12.a:0 "A point of pride!"
#NTC Railway Construction
fengtian.13.t:0 "Building the Jilin-Hailong Line"
fengtian.13.d:0 "With the reorganisation of the Northeast Transportation Committee complete, several new railways have been proposed for construction and, in some cases, completion. The first major project is the Jilin-Hailong Railway, originally planned in 1927, which met serious delays due to the eruption of war in the south, and Japanese attempts to stall construction. The line has been operating in a limited capacity since 1931 but remains incomplete, with a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThese companies, in the abscence of Mantetsu and Japanese engineers, will do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."

The line has been operating in limited capacity since 1931, but remains incomplete, with both Mantetsu and a collection of smaller Chinese companies vying for the contract to continue building.\n\nThe Japanese claim, and perhaps correctly, that they could have the railway complete in half the time due to their resources and expertise, but choosing a Chinese company would do a great deal to demonstrate Chinese strength and independence."
fengtian.13.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.13.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.14.t:0 "The Jilin-Hailong Line is Complete"
fengtian.14.d:0 "After months of construction and various unfortunate delays, the Jilin-Hailong line is finally complete, extending the reach of our main rail system into areas otherwise difficult to access. After reviewing plans and available resources, the NTC will undoubtedly prepare to issue another contract."
fengtian.14.a:0 "Great news!"
fengtian.15.t:0 "Building the Changchun-Dailai Line"
fengtian.15.d:0 "The NTC's next major project is the Changchun-Dalai Line, which was originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities. This work in particular serves a strategic purpose, as it should ease the movement of men and materials from north to south significantly."
fengtian.15.d_jap:0 "The NTC's next major project is the Changchun-Dalai Line, which was originally proposed by the Japanese to connect Mantetsu's smaller provincial lines with central lines running through major cities. This work in particular serves a strategic purpose, as it should ease the movement of men and materials from North to South significantly. While the line does have Japanese origins and would serve to extend Mantetsu's reach, NTC planners nonetheless note its practical value. As before, Mantetsu offers to carry out the construction process themselves, but Chinese companies stand ready to perform the same task."
fengtian.15.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.15.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.16.t:0 "The Changchun-Dailai Line is Complete"
fengtian.16.d:0 "The new Changchun-Dailai line now stands among the most modern in China, taking full advantage of more recent technologies, and visually demonstrating the sheer gap in time between the older lines originating in the 1920s. Truly, the Northeast is moving toward a brighter future."
fengtian.16.a:0 "Excellent!"
fengtian.17.t:0 "Building the Taonan-Suolun Line"
fengtian.17.d:0 "The last of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line which, like other recent projects, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway."
fengtian.17.d_jap:0 "The last of the NTC's major construction projects is the Taonan-Suolun Line which, like other recent works, serves to connect major lines to otherwise difficult to reach areas. Unlike the previous line, however, this will connect directly to the Chinese Eastern Railway, theoretically keeping Mantetsu's creeping influence further from its operations. All the same, Mantetsu offers to construct the railroad, likely hoping to salvage at least something from the situation."
fengtian.17.a:0 "Choose a Chinese Company."
fengtian.17.b:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.18.t:0 "The Taonan-Suolun Line is Complete"
fengtian.18.d:0 "With the completion of the Taonan-Suolin Line, the Northeast Transportation Commission can focus on smaller projects, and on ensuring that China's railways remain Chinese. This second task will undoubtedly be a challenge all to itself."
fengtian.18.a:0 "Wansui!"
fengtian.19.t:0 "Railway Construction Workers Strike!"
fengtian.19.d:0 "Chinese workers, complaining of inadequate pay and difficult working conditions, have refused to return to work in a carefully coordinated strike. Despite the presence of railway unions in the Northeast, their coordination in this instance suggests the involvement of the Communications Clique, possibly as part of an attempt to demonstrate their influence or retaliate for some perceived slight.\n\nWhile this turn of events effects them too, the Japanese are happy to watch us squabble amongst ourselves. The strike will end, but not without causing significant delays."
fengtian.19.a:0 "Unfortunate."
fengtian.20.t:0 "Delays Plague Railway Construction"
fengtian.20.d:0 "The nature of the situation was fairly clear as soon as the first signs appeared; shipments unaccountably missing, rails laid at just enough of an incorrect angle to require complete re-construction, and sudden inspections of the labour force by Japanese agents supposedly seeking 'dangerous criminals'; inspections which inevitably required the suspension of work.\n\nThese same tactics were employed by the Japanese during the 1920s against the Fengtian Clique's railway projects, attempting to slow and discredit Chinese construction in order to limit competition to Mantetsu, and now they seem to be delaying our efforts once again. Unfortunately, there is little we can do."
fengtian.20.a:0 "Frustrating."
fengtian.21.t:0 "Delays Plague Mantetsu Railway Construction"
fengtian.21.d:0 "Despite Mantetsu's excellent engineers and equipment, the current railway construction project has encountered repeated delays as workers unaccountably go missing, materials vanish in the night, and bandits raid the camps alongside the rails, only to disappear before Japanese troops arrive.\n\nThe local police and our intelligence services are unwilling to do much to investigate or solve these repeated incidents, instead preferring to watch the Japanese squirm. The fact that Mantetsu received the contract to build the railway is well known to the public, and some patriotic citizens appear to have taken matters into their own hands."
fengtian.21.a:0 "What a pity."
#Imperial Fury/Japanese Aid Cut

fengtian.23.t:0 "Japanese Aid Returns"
fengtian.23.d:0 "Apparently feeling that their lesson in obedience is clear and punishing enough, the Japanese have resumed their aid. We should be careful about provoking them in the future, and make sure not to push the Concordia Association too far out of the Assembly before we are ready."

#Clearing Investment Dearth
fengtian.24.t:0 "Wu Jinglian Criticises Japan"
fengtian.24.d:0 "Citing the recent expansion of the Japanese military garrison in Shenyang, Wu Jinglian launched a scathing criticism of Japan and its foreign policy from the Assembly floor. Though other politicians have been known to disparage the Japanese in the past, the post of Foreign Minister gives Wu's words a different kind of significance, and elevates them above the confines of the Assembly.\n\nWasting no time, the Japanese Consul-General has already demanded that we remove Minister Wu from office."

fengtian.26.t:0 "Japanese Investment in Shipping and Tourism"
fengtian.26.d:0 "Ever since the establishment of its Yamato Hotel line, Mantetsu has actively promoted tourism in Fengtian, drawing wealthy and middle class tourists from the Home Islands to travel about Manchuria's 'exotic landscape' on its state of the art railways. In all that time, however, it has never extended its tourist ambitions to the sea.\n\nA small group of wealthy investors from Tokyo now intend to partner with several local shipping companies and establish a water-borne alternative to Mantetsu's railway tourism, while performing shipping services on the side, thus creating 'Bohai Waterborne Enterprises'.\n\nNone of this would be possible withour our efforts to encourage Sino-Japanese business partnership."

fengtian.29.t:0 "Wu Jinglian Negotiates New Trade terms"
fengtian.29.d:0 "The [QIE.GetAdjective]-German embargo on goods moving to and from the Northeast hit its economy hard. Recovery came largely as a product of trade handled with the Legation Cities as an intermediary, allowing the embargo to be sidestepped, but at the cost of additional tariffs and reliance on third parties. With Shanghai businesses, both legitimate and illegitimate, fully aware of their control over an entire region's trade, trade deals have always been lacklustre despite their necessity.\n\nSomehow Wu Jinglian has managed to push through years of negotiations however, and secured a deal offering better terms for trade. Rumours swirl that a number of palms were greased in the process, but nobody seems to want to ask questions."

As the new rulers in the area, we are expected to maintain peace and order, which has now been substantially disturbed. Several local garrisons have been attacked, villages burned, and towns raided. Forces have already been dispatched to deal with the issue, but a concerted effort to wipe out resistance in the rear areas, behind our front lines, is likely needed to deal with them permanently."

Groups of deserters, stemming from our enemy's former armies and our own forces, have begun organizing in order to take on larger targets across Daming. Several trains in the vicinity of Shimen have come under attack, and have caused our logisticians serious concern due to the Jinhan Line's major strategic importance. Local garrisons will be mobilized to deal with the issue, but matters such as these behind our lines deserve a coordinated response."

In this case, several local warlords formerly loyal to Wu Peifu have seemingly taken offense at our policies in Ruyang, and seized the Gongxian Arsenal at Xinyang. Despite their relative organization and the weapons from the arsenal, their troops are still too few and too ill-equipped to combat our own on a large scale, but they will nontheless force us to divert forces away from the front lines. We need a coherent response to these cases of resistance."

#Soy Agricultural Initiative
fengtian.42.t:0 "The Soy Agricultural Initiative"
fengtian.42.d:0 "Soybeans are an extremely flexible crop, useful for human food, animal feed, fertiliser, and for a wide variety of industrial applications. Mantetsu's Research Wing has made great strides in making their growing, processing, and use more efficient, but planting percentages across Fengtian remain relatively stagnant. Korean farmers, who make up the majority of immigrants to Manchuria, are excellent rice planters, and like many Chinese prefer crops they have more experience with.\n\nIn an attempt to change this, Mantetsu began the Soy Agricultural Initiative, a plan intending to educate farmers and incentivise the production of soy as a cash crop, but it has so far been poorly received. Mantetsu hopes to gain the government's support in promoting the initiative, which would almost certainly increase soy yields and therefore long term profits.\n\nA few dissenting voices have pointed out that excessive soy production could reduce food security in the northeast, and in the right conditions might lead to a famine."

However, this plan is somewhat confounded by the overwhelming success of Mantetsu's Soy Agricultural Initiative, which replaced vast tracts of rice plots with soy farming. As a result, we have nowhere near enough rice and millet to feed Korea, while our soy production remains key to our industry and international trade.\n\nThanks to Japan's political and economic influence, we have little choice but to comply."

#Hokkaido Farming
fengtian.47.t:0 "A Proposal from Mantetsu"
fengtian.47.d:0 "A representative from Mantetsu's Research Wing has come forward with a proposal, the acceptance of which he assures the government is in its best interest, but which he insists must be kept completely secret. Apparently, following the Drought of 1939, Mantetsu brought together farming experts, senior officials from agricultural organisations, and academic scholars with relevant expertise in order to lead an initiative with the aim of improving agricultural efficiency and production in Fengtian. After months of testing, one of several research teams created a solution based upon farming methods used in Hokkaido, which might allow the average Chinese family to farm ten entire hectares of land without needing to hire seasonal workers, thus improving production and freeing up labour for factories in Anshan, Fushun, and Shenyang. The Mantetsu official indicates that these methods should be spread through the dissemination of informational leaflets and Chinese instructors, themselves trained by Japanese experts, and he seemed to stress the idea that this project should be disassociated in every possible way from the South Manchurian Railway.\n\nAfter some investigation, the Army's intelligence section has determined that the Kwantung Army refused to support Mantetsu's efforts for unclear reasons, suggesting that the two factions may be competing, or that this is simply a part of some elaborate Japanese ruse. The relatively liberal officials in Mantetsu's research wing and other bureaucratic roles have been known to clash with the conservative Kwantung Army."
fengtian.47.a:0 "Accept the proposal."
fengtian.47.b:0 "Refuse the proposal."

fengtian.48.t:0 "Hokkaido Farming Bears Fruit"
fengtian.48.d:0 "After much time and effort, the Hokkaido farming methods proposed by Mantetsu seem to be bearing fruit in some areas, increasing production, and freeing up additional land in the north."
fengtian.48.a:0 "Excellent."

fengtian.49.t:0 "Discovery"
fengtian.49.d:0 "Although neither made any public announcement, Mantetsu's research wing has communicated that the Kwantung Army discovered its farming collaboration with our government, a claim backed up by findings from our intelligence services. General Kekichi Ueda himself is said to have stormed into the office of the Mantetsu president, Yosuke Matsuoka, and delivered a thunderous verbal barrage regarding the necessity to keep Fengtian dependent upon Japanese aid. The Kwantung Army's ability to punish Mantetsu is ultimately limited, as the powerful company is practically autonomous, but there's little doubt that the Army will go out of its way to make things difficult for everyone involved. Unfortunately, this will certainly be the end of this specific collaboration project with Mantetsu."
fengtian.49.a:0 "Unfortunate."

fengtian.50.t:0 "Discovery"
fengtian.50.d:0 "Dr Y.C. James Yen, the leader of the Rural Reconstruction Movement, today denounced our collaboration with Mantetsu to bring Hokkaido farming styles to Fengtian, declaring that 'China must reform itself' and not submit to 'forced restructuring disguised as collaborative reform'. Our legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people will almost certainly be impacted severely by this turn of events. Some ministers suggest that we might defend our collaboration, painting it as an instance in which we are able to manipulate Mantetsu, instead of the other way around. Others suggest that this may simply dig our hole deeper."
fengtian.50.a:0 "Guilty as charged."
fengtian.50.b:0 "Our actions were legitimate!"

fengtian.51.t:0 "Popular Opinion Shifts in our Favour"
fengtian.51.d:0 "Against what seemed to be all odds, the government's defence of the Hokkaido farming project seems to have convinced not only Dr Yen, but also the vast majority of the population. The impact has been mitigated, and the programme can continue uninterrupted."
fengtian.51.a:0 "Wonderful news!"

fengtian.52.t:0 "The Public is Incensed!"
fengtian.52.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, both Dr Yen and the general public seem unconvinced by our defence of the Hokkaido Farming project. As a result, the programme will almost certainly grind to a halt, and the government's credibility has dwindled significantly."
fengtian.52.a:0 "Damn!"

#Focus Tree Specific Events

fengtian.53.t:0 "Enrich the Country, Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.53.d:0 "After decades of decline and destitution, the necessity of progress and development has never been more glaring. However, while we cannot afford to stagnate, change comes with its own risks - namely mismanagement and public discontent.\n\nThe task falls to the government to answer calls to 'Enrich the Country and Strengthen the Army', but we must prioritise one or the other."
fengtian.53.a:0 "We must enrich the Country!"
fengtian.53.b:0 "We must strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.53.c:0 "Tell me more about the state of the Economy."
fengtian.53.e:0 "Tell me more about the state of the Army."

fengtian.54.t:0 "Enrich the Country"
fengtian.54.d:0 "While Manchuria's resources are rich and diverse, and Fengtian stands as the third greatest industrial centre in East Asia, its economy remains plagued by a number of structural problems, the symptoms of which cripple the state and slow progress toward Southern Reclamation. Fengtian's biggest investor is the state itself, feeding tax revenues back into key sectors such as steel, coal, and soybean production. Yet, the Japanese and Mantetsu trail the government only marginally in this regard, and invest far more widely, giving them an unquestioned grip upon both Fengtian's economy and society.\n\nWhile the extent of this grip grows by the day, reform could serve to increase the government's revenues through the suppression of otherwise endemic corruption, the creation of a healthier environment for private investment, and the unfortunate but necessary cooperation with Mantetsu in key areas like infrastructure and technology. So long as the government can maintain political autonomy, and at least a majority of control over the economy, it can pursue initiatives to contest Japanese influence, retain legitimacy in the eyes of the Chinese people, and eventually achieve its core goals.\n\nIt should be noted that while Japan has a vested interest in seeing us succeed relative to [QIE.GetNameDef], they will only provide assistance with specific efforts aiming to move past our backward industry, even as they attempt to widen their already worrying influence over our economy."
fengtian.54.a:0 "Let us enrich the country!"
fengtian.54.b:0 "Perhaps the Army is more important?"

fengtian.55.t:0 "Strengthen the Army"
fengtian.55.d:0 "The Fengtian Army, officially the Army of the Republic, is an impressive sight by most Chinese standards, though pales in comparison to most foreign forces, and has only recently recovered much of its strength after its decimation in the last Zhifeng War. The majority of Fengtian's weapons and vehicles are outdated, even including its standard issue rifle provided by the Japanese, and organisation below the division level is a patchy affair due to limited communications equipment. The Army's greatest deficiency is in morale, partially as a consequence of foreign-trained and even outright Japanese officers widespread throughout the ranks.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fengtian Flying Corps, officially The China Flying Corps, is the pride and joy of the Grand Marshal's oldest son, Zhang Xueliang, who used his passion for aviation to train its first pilots. The Flying Corps performed well during the war, and lost air superiority over the Zhili only upon the arrival of modern German-piloted planes. Since then, the Corps has grown slightly, though its planes remain over a decade behind the European standard.\n\nOverall, Fengtian's forces lag behind those of [QIE.GetNameDef], and remain heavily dependent upon Japanese equipment and aid. This aid, and whatever Fengtian can do to become self-sufficient, will be crucial to narrowing that gap and eventually reclaiming the south."
fengtian.55.a:0 "Let us strengthen the Army!"
fengtian.55.b:0 "But what of the economy?"

fengtian.56.t:0 "An Empty-Handed Return"
fengtian.56.d:0 "Despite their best efforts, the scientists and engineers we dispatched to study Japanese manufacturing methods have returned empty-handed. Perhaps the sheer disparity in sophistication between their technology and our own was a hinderance, or maybe the Japanese went out of their way to be unhelpful. Whatever the case, the general population seems to have been impressed more by the apparent accomplishment of our 'top men' than their failure, as this has gone mysteriously unreported. As far as anyone knows, our scientists went overseas to receive very prestigious awards."
fengtian.56.a:0 "Top men."

fengtian.57.t:0 "Reforming Manchurian Finance"
fengtian.57.d:0 "At the start of the 20th century, Manchuria was a poorly managed frontier, fraught by lawlessness and banditry. With the rule of Zhang, however, came rapid reforms through his finance minister Wang Yongjiang. Wang backed his currency, originally no different from those printed by other warlords, with silver, generating confidence which led to some gains in value against the Japanese Yen. Extensive tax reform solved outstanding debts, and by the early 1920s the economy was bolstered by immigrants fleeing instability throughout the rest of China.\n\nOf course, this could not last, and Minister Wang resigned in 1928 and died the next year. With Fengtian's economy only beginning to recover from eight years of post-war decline, the time has come to implement new reforms, inspired by those of the old, and return the Northeast to its rightful place as one of China's most prosperous regions.\n\nA minister must be chosen to draw up the necessary plans and determine priorities for government efforts."

fengtian.58.t:0 "Yamato Hotel Licenses"
fengtian.58.d:0 "Mantetsu's Yamato Hotel line has long been a staple of the South Manchuria Railway Zone; the concessions zone ceded first to Imperial Russia and then to Japan after 1906, and then expanded following the 21 demands of 1915 through a rather loose interpretation of its provisions to include all of southern Manchuria. All the same, while treaty rights permit Japanese to reside and engage in business and manufacture of any kind, construction still theoretically requires approval from the local governor and, if necessary, the Grand Marshal himself.\n\nMantetsu aims to build a series of new hotels, all of which will inevitably become hubs for further Japanese activity, and while construction could never be stopped without angering the Japanese government, limits might be imposed to forestall Japanese influence in certain areas. Unfortunately, as much as they may stand as physical edifices of Japan's strength, the hotels are frequented by the Japanese elite and many Mantetsu employees, making them crucial for the rapid development we desire."
fengtian.58.a:0 "Limit construction."
fengtian.58.b:0 "Let them build as they please."

fengtian.59.t:0 "The Northeast Industrial Development Commission"
fengtian.59.d:0 "At Japan's request, and with no particular reason to refuse, we have established a legal and fiscal framework enabling the creation of the Northeast Industrial Development Commission. Serving to oversee and direct the development of Fengtian's industry, mostly through the allocation of funds and leases, the commission now faces the question of its composition.\n\nThe Concordia Association has proposed the inclusion of a series of extremely talented individuals with experience working for the Nissan and Mitsubishi Zaibatsu in Japan, who stress the need for an export driven economy taking advantage of Fengtian's existing natural resources, while the Grand Marshal's generals insist upon the necessity of an 'Army First' approach to development, and are using their considerable influence to ensure the placement of military men on the commission. The Communications Clique recommends their own presence, and advocate a mixed developmental approach, referencing their long experience with business dealings across China, as well as more recently here in the Northeast.\n\nUnfortunately, a compromise involving all three parties is practically impossible, as a clear vision is necessary for the task, and intra-commission bickering would almost certainly render it functionally impotent. Additionally, although the commission's nature as an appointed body permits the presence of Japanese in its makeup, the public and much of the Assembly will likely react negatively to their presence. At the same time, the Japanese will not appreciate exclusion."
fengtian.59.a:0 "Prioritise exports."
fengtian.59.b:0 "The army must come first."
fengtian.59.c:0 "A mixed approach is best."

fengtian.60.t:0 "Mantetsu Chosabū"
fengtian.60.d:0 "The South Manchuria Railway Company's Research Wing, colloquially known as 'Mantetsu Chosabū', has grown over the years from a mere corporate R&D department into the heart of Japan's colonial research programme, with divisions dedicated to everything from agricultural science to intelligence gathering. The sheer scale of Mantetsu Chosabū and its ambitions has lead to the opening of offices in Berlin, Vancouver, and New York to attract foreign talent, and wide recruitment from Japan's foremost universities. The result is a surprisingly liberal and open minded intellectual community, which sometimes goes places scientific inquiry before nationalistic concerns.\n\nThis appears to be one of those instances, as our government has been approached by a Chosabū representative offering future assistance in one of several fields. It should be noted that the Kwantung Army garrison in [GetDalianName] were strongly opposed to this arrangement."

Although the books are clearly out of date, and certain sections have been redacted, there is still much to learn. Of particular interest is a work titled 'Rakka Ryūsui', or 'Falling Blossoms; Flowing Water' which details the work of Motojiro Akashi, Japan's premier spymaster during the Russo-Japanese War."

fengtian.69.t:0 "The Jinzhou Industrial Zone"
fengtian.69.d:0 "Jinzhou's convenient location makes it excellent for a proposed industrial zone, and several groups have already begun jockeying for a dominant position in development; most notably a Mantetsu subsidiary specialising in canning and light metal work, the Communications Clique who want to establish a rolling stock factory, and the military which insists that the zone must be used for munitions manufacture ahead of 'personal capitalistic gains'. The situation is made somewhat unusual by the Communications Clique, who are usually able to front quite a bit of money, and rumours suggest that several members are under pressure from the military to weaken their own bidding position."
fengtian.69.a:0 "Choose Mantetsu."
fengtian.69.b:0 "Choose the Communications Clique."
fengtian.69.c:0 "Choose the Zhang Clique."

fengtian.70.t:0 "Filling the Silver Reserve"
fengtian.70.d:0 "A full silver reserve is crucial to building confidence in Fengtian's currency, and even more crucial to attracting foreign investment, without which Fengtian can never hope to match the Zhili to the south who have been, for the past eight years, flush with German capital. However, silver is an expensive commodity, and paying for enough to fill the reserve fully would undoubtedly cut funding from other areas.\n\nSome ministers have privately suggested only buying about half of the desired quantity, as many believed the reserve was less than full before the last Zhifeng War, and those rumours were never confirmed. Of course, it was later difficult to explain the significant economic recession that followed the government's inability to settle its war debts.\n\nStill, filling the reserve inadequately would certainly be a big risk, but perhaps a worthwhile one."
fengtian.70.a:0 "Fill the reserve."
fengtian.70.b:0 "No risk no reward."

fengtian.71.t:0 "Economic Disaster!"
fengtian.71.d:0 "After the Bank of Japan and Mitsui Bank, major lenders to our own government, unexpectedly called for outstanding debts to be paid, our Central Bank suddenly found itself unable to provide sufficient silver for the transaction. News of the situation quickly leaked to the public provoking a run on the banks, and widespread financial panic. Rumour suggests that the crisis is not a product of gross mismanagement and incompetence on behalf of the government, which would surprise few in Fengtian, but rather a deliberate move to deceive the public. Mantetsu's offices in Shenyang and Harbin have already begun a full scale investigation, and unless action is taken they seem likely to discover a very incriminating paper trail.\n\nWhile there are several options available, it would be unfortunate if certain government files inexplicably went missing..."
fengtian.71.a:0 "Burn the evidence!"

fengtian.72.t:0 "Banking Evidence Discovered!"
fengtian.72.d:0 "After a thorough investigation involving untold bribes and threats, Mantetsu investigators have concluded that our government intentionally deceived its people, and is entirely to blame for the recent financial disaster. We are in no position to refuse their calls for the arrests of several involved ministers, but conveniently the Grand Marshal and his closest advisers have been spared direct blame, and Mantetsu's Director Yosuke Matsuoka has suggested that in return for political favours, the entire matter could be shelved indefinitely."
fengtian.72.a:0 "Accept the offer."
fengtian.72.b:0 "Refuse the offer."

fengtian.73.t:0 "Japan Agrees to the Bailout"
fengtian.73.d:0 "In a move that will surely save our economy, Japan has agreed to pay for sufficient silver to fill our reserve, and will not look further into the matter. Of course, this was likely inspired by little more than self interest, but some say that Japan may not be so bad after all..."
fengtian.73.a:0 "We are saved!"

fengtian.74.t:0 "Japan Refuses the Bailout"
fengtian.74.d:0 "Despite our pleas, Japan has refused a bailout, leaving us in the same economic position we were before we made the request and with ample humiliation to boot. The only 'silver lining' is that many citizens, even including some employees of Mantetsu, have lost a great deal of faith in Japan's benevolent position toward China."
fengtian.74.a:0 "If only that was more than a metaphor."
fengtian.74.b:0 "Perhaps Minister Ruan can smooth things over."

fengtian.75.t:0 "The State of the Officer Corps"
fengtian.75.d:0 "Fengtian's officer corps is an unusual mix of young Chinese educated at the Rikugun Shikan Gakkō in Japan, older Chinese who served in the Civil Wars, and Japanese officers part of the Military Mission to Fengtian, all united by common loyalties to individuals more than any special dedication to the state. Japanese officers in particular are known to prize any station in the Northeast, the devalued currency allowing them to live lives of relative luxury, and hire servants for most menial tasks, earning them the enmity of not only their fellows but also the local population.\n\nNow, with the founding of the Shenyang National Academy, these officers have taken the opportunity to mock the academy's current accommodations, which are decades old and in disrepair. While a newer modern building rises nearby, the pitiful state of the academy at present leaves the government open to criticism."
fengtian.75.a:0 "Unfortunate."

fengtian.76.t:0 "Expel Japanese Officers"
fengtian.76.d:0 "Japan has maintained a military mission in Fengtian ever since the founding of the Fengtian Government in 1926, who were preceded by over a decade of informal Japanese operations in support of Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Clique. The Mission has served to aid many aspects of the military's development, primarily through the supply of arms and equipment, but also training and planning assistance.\n\nUnfortunately, however, the shortage of officers in the aftermath of the civil wars provided Japan with the opportunity to attach Japanese officers to command positions in the field, and even lead our units independently. This has had a negative effect upon the morale of our men, making Japan's influence all too obvious, even as the Military Mission attempts, and often succeeds, in influencing our affairs of government. In order for our soldiers and the Chinese people to have any respect for our Government, the Japanese Military Mission must leave."

fengtian.82.d:0 "Colonel Doihara, the head of the Kwantung Garrison's intelligence section, has come forward with a proposal he intends to implement with or without our assistance, though the former would be very much preferred.\n\nThe German intervention effectively closed the vast majority of the Chinese market to Japanese products, including particularly profitable goods like the 'Golden Bat' cigarette. Doihara intends access the old market through the re-branding of these cigarettes as 'Golden Dragons', then sell them via the Legation Cities to avoid [QIE.GetAdjective] embargoes, and most crucially the insertion of trace amounts of opium to ensure quick addiction. All we would need to do is support poppy production in key areas of Liaobei and Xing'an, and in time the profits could begin to flow.\n\nDoihara is a thoroughly unsavoury character, and our involvement in such a project could undermine our political legitimacy, but the government desperately needs funds, and this might provide an edge against [QIE.GetNameDef]."

Conveying his apologies for delays in his programme over a very expensive meal in the elaborate dining room, Doihara seemed genuinely frustrated, but after returning, our agent has been careful to emphasise that progress is still on track and the money will be flowing soon.\n\nOther intelligence operatives in the Legation Cities, and other parts of China, tell a rather different story, and suggest that the operation is already profitable, with the vast majority of the money being used to fund Doihara's other subversive activities. The evidence seems to suggest that our representative in Shanghai has been bribed, but surely Doihara will eventually cough up what he's promised..."

His body was reportedly found outside a back-alley brothel alongside those of several bodyguards, identifiable only thanks to its uniform and testimonies from nearby civilians.\n\nKempeitai agents have already begun an investigation in partnership with the Shanghai Municipal Police, but for all intents and purposes Doihara's initiative can be considered dead in the water."

However, recent discoveries by police have turned up something unusually troubling. It seems that a group of Recovery League politicians, who were made mayors of townships in Jilin, owing to their experience with governing in the South, had in fact never been mayors anywhere or at all. Instead, they had killed and replaced their namesakes and, through a complicated plot of deceit, fooled the authorities while eliminating any who might contradict them.\n\nThe web of lies, corruption, and murder necessary to sustain this falsehood stretches across the whole of the province, and the damage dealt to the government's legitimacy is not inconsiderable."

fengtian.112.d:0 "The iron ore deposits at Anshan have been worked by a Japanese-owned subsidiary of Mantetsu since 1918, known as "Anshan Iron and Steel", serving as one of Japan's most valuable sources of steel outside the Home Islands. When the facilities were first constructed most of the ore required little digging, as the deposits lie close to the surface, but as of the current date more extensive excavation is required to continue operations. The company has begun this expansion work without acquiring a lease for the extra land from the local authorities, destroying several farm properties in the process, and despite promises neither compensation, nor the lease have been forthcoming.\n\nProtests quickly broke out among local farmers over the issue, and soon escalated into a riot that severely damaged expensive mining equipment, which our police refused to prevent, citing the technically illegal nature of the operations. On its own initiative, a nearby Japanese garrison from Anshan stepped in, and used lethal force to disperse the riot. This slaughter of our citizens has not gone unnoticed, and existing anti-Japanese sentiment has only been inflamed. The people will hold us accountable in our response, but the deposits and the company working them are essential to Japan's strategic goals, and our relationship with the Japanese permits little room to manoeuvre."

The Kwantung Garrison performed a series of motorised and armoured manoeuvres in full view of the capital, their message clear. Any escalation of this situation would undoubtedly result in further rebukes to which we can make no meaningful response."

fengtian.114.d:0 "In the years since the Fengtian's Army retreat beyond the Great Wall, a watchful eye has been kept on the south. The natural chokepoint created by the Shanhai Pass has always made it hard for Zhili armies to get in, but equally difficult for our own to get out. Any effort to reclaim China has always depended upon a moment of southern weakness. Such a moment now seems set to arrive, as simmering anti-German sentiment has erupted into violence in the League of Eight Provinces, and the governor of Anhui has broken away from Nanjing - hoping to leverage the League and the Central Government against one another for his own gain.\n\nUnfortunately, we are not yet ready to begin our long-awaited campaign, there are outstanding issues in the Northeast to be settled and it is still not clear exactly what will become of the situation in the League. We must watch and wait for the right opportunity."

The conversation, in which the Grand Marshal described "enemies to the North, South, East, and West", puts Fengtian's relations with Japan in unconventionally blunt terms damaging to our propaganda and Japan's interests.\n\nThe broadcast was doubly damaging thanks to its capture of Zhang discussing the realities of [QIE.GetNameDef]'s relative industrial and military strength, and the degree to which we must rely on the Japanese for crucial technology, something which we have been careful to conceal from the public."

The article described in substantial detail the extensive degree to which Mantetsu and other Japanese companies have established control over most sectors of our economy, and set a forecast predicting near complete control within five years time.

The latest film, 'Song of the White Orchid', has attracted notable attention however.\n\nThe piece involves a romantic entanglement between a Japanese man (Kazuo Hasegawa) and a Chinese woman (Li Xianglan) where Li leaves her lover through a misunderstanding, and joins a Manchu bandit group plotting to sabotage the South Manchuria Railway. She later learns of the deliberate arrangement of this misunderstanding by [QIE.GetAdjective] spies, renews her faith in Hasegawa, and undermines the plot. Both protagonists seem clear allegories for their respective countries, and concerns have been raised, but the anti-[QIE.GetAdjective] propaganda value is significant, and the theme tune is just so catchy..."

Aside from some first-time viewers being scared out of the theatre, the overall message is demeaning, playing to Japanese assumptions that Chinese are, by habit, dirty and lice-infested; the reception being quite negative as a result, and leading some to wonder whether this might have been avoided if the government took a more active role in production."

fengtian.151.d:0 "As the year 1936 dawns, Fengtian stands in the Northeast as the final bastion of China's Republican dream. As with many things in China however, the abstractions of this dream hide complex and often inconvenient truths. The Fengtian Government of the Republic of China, contesting [QIE.GetNameDef]'s claims to legitimacy, maintains democracy only as a thin veneer, covering what has always been, and perhaps always will be, an authoritarian state.\n\nThe Assembly in Shenyang is widely regarded to be corrupt, power divided between autocratic generals, unscrupulous railway barons, and Pan-Asianist ideologues with questionable motivations. Amid it all stands Grand Marshal Zhang Zuolin, his ambitions great, but limited by the stark realities of [QIE.GetAdjective] strength and Japanese power; for now forced to walk a political tightrope between the two, and above the machinations of his own divided government. The status quo cannot last forever, and if the right moment to strike south is not chosen soon, it may never come at all.\n\nThe staggering cost of the wars with the south and the severance of economic ties left Fengtian reeling, and while past years have been spent rebuilding, there is much left to do. Likewise, the army has suffered from neglect, and must be reorganised. The Japanese, their influence growing by the day, present both a dire threat and an opportunity. The waters ahead are treacherous, and it will take a truly great helmsman to steer the ship of state not only to survival, but also toward the reclamation of all China.\n\nBriefings are available on Fengtian's special mechanics, its relationship with the Japanese, and internal politics."

fengtian.152.d:0 "The Fengtian Government is unstable, pressured from without and within, ultimately a fusion of elements that would be contradictory were it not for their shared goals. The parties, more accurately termed factions, exercise their grip through dominance of the country's institutions instead of mass appeal. As such, the 'popularity' of parties should be taken to represent their degree of control over the country's government and other structures of power, control being determined not by the popular policies of ministers, but by choices, focuses, and events that increase or diminish their power.\n\nConsequently, your aim should be to balance the various factions, each of which has the potential to abuse their power if given too much of it, though each will do so differently. As they grow in strength, the factions will nominate ministers, each of whom will pursue their own agenda, potentially in line with their faction, or their country, but which could also have negative consequences in the short or long term.\n\nAnother crucial point is the role of the Concordia Association, also explained in the politics briefing, the strength of which can be taken as a loose indicator of Japanese influence over the country. As their influence grows, it will lead to increasing bonuses to production, but at the cost of political power and autonomy. The rise of this influence is inevitable over time, and should be viewed with caution."

While the Grand Marshal and others utilise a wide variety of means to slow and inconvenience the Japanese, their presence is necessary and the growth of their influence inevitable. The primary institution responsible for this growth is the South Manchuria Railway Company, more commonly termed 'Mantetsu', the profits from which in recent years have accounted for nearly a quarter of Japan's entire national budget.\n\nAt the same time, the Japanese need Fengtian and what it represents. Its cooperation and the prospect of a victory in the South offer to save Japan a great deal of time and money. The result is a tenuous balance, the Japanese ever looking for more profit and power, but well aware that pushing too hard will place Zhang Zuolin in a politically untenable position, and thus bring their careful efforts to naught.\n\nSo far Zhang has pursued a patchwork policy; promotion of Pan-Asian brotherhood with Japan, only to intermittently replace this with repudiations of Japanese initiatives that push too far, and consistent private efforts to lessen Japanese influence. How to proceed will be your choice, but caution is advised."

Easily bribed and tempted, they often serve to promote the interests of whoever is willing to pay, and consequently the 'league' is highly splintered despite controlling a large portion of the Assembly, lacking the political will to act decisively.\n\n2. The Zhang Clique\n\nA collection of loyalists and generals, the Zhang Clique holds no specific ideology beyond promoting the furtherance of the Grand Marshal's political powers. While making pretences to democracy, Zhang's supporters are not committed to republican ideals, and promote them only for their utility.\n\n3. The Communications Clique\n\nThe sole politically coherent faction to emerge from the former Beiyang Government, the Communications Clique are a collection of railroad and telegraph barons, primarily self-interested, but locked in confrontation with Mantetsu and the Concordia Association over the country's infrastructure.\n\n4. The Concordia Association\n\nA grouping of politicians and lobbyists with all the trappings of a party, the Concordia Association represents the interests of Mantetsu, and sometimes other Japanese Zaibatsu, in the Assembly.

However, the major lines running from [GetDalianName] to Harbin have suddenly experienced a series of strikes, shutting down service in protest of the proposed legislation.\n\nFaced with this overwhelming rejection, the legislation has been shelved for the timebeing, and it seems likely that Li Shaogeng and his widespread contacts are responsible."
fengtian.175.d_Liang:0 "As of early this morning the major railway lines running between [GetDalianName], Shenyang, and Harbin have experienced near total shutdowns as strikes seemingly spontaneously erupted along them, effectively grinding the country's resource economy to a halt.\n\nMantetsu and its advocates in the Concordia Association seem to have taken the opportunity to ship in workers from the Kwantung Leased Territory to ensure that basic services continue to run, but the strike has continued nontheless; demonstrating Liang Shiyi's willingness to damage even his own cause in response to refusal by the Grand Marshal."

Some claim that the image is doctored, while others believe the tiger is only stuffed, but the aspect garnering the most attention is the context.

fengtian.181.d:0 "The levying of seemingly arbitrary taxes to fill gaps in the budget, genuine or not, has been a long standing practice of national, regional, and local governments across China, including our own. This time, Interior Minister Yuan is pressuring the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway and Economic Minister, Li Shaogeng, to levy additional taxes on the railway for the purposes of further strengthening the army; threatening an investigation of Communications Clique assets, as well as various fees the Board already charges its customers, the revenue from which almost certainly sticks to a number of fingers.\n\nThere is every likelyhood that, as Yuan is a member of the CER board himself, this is a power-play on his part to weaken his rivals, but such a tax would undoubtedly help fill the national treasury, if at the cost of undercutting competition to Mantetsu. It seems likely that the Grand Marshal will be forced to settle this dispute, lest it spiral out of control."

fengtian.182.d:0 "Seething over the decision to prevent his rail-tax proposal, Minister Yuan Jinkai has gone ahead with his threat to intensively investigate the other members of the CER Board, as well as the Communications Clique at large. Already police forces have begun to converge, and unless the Grand Marshal intercedes soon, there is an increasing risk that the investigation could uncover larger secrets best kept from the public eye.\n\nOf course, if his investigation is stopped, Yuan will almost certainly resign his position as Minister of the Interior."

fengtian.183.d_large:0 "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government, and the subject of those fears has now come to pass. Though the Communications Clique has been hit hardest by this scandal, the government as a whole has suffered a serious blow to its legitimacy, despite Yuan's best efforts to keep the full results under wraps. Though there have been calls for Yuan to resign, damage control takes priority, and the Interior Minister has earned a great deal of respect from the general population, ironic though it may be."
fengtian.183.d_small:0 "There were concerns when Yuan began his investigation that it might reveal the deep webs of corruption widely believed to exist within the Government, but fortunately its results squarely target members of the Communications Clique, leaving the government largely unscathed. Yuan will almost certainly walk away with a greater degree of control over the CER, and greater respect among the general population, despite his own 'alleged' shady dealings."

fengtian.193.d.jinhan:0 "Originally financed by Belgian capital, the Jinghan Railway runs north-to-south from Beijing in Zhili to Hankou in Hubei. For decades it has served as one of China's primary transit arteries, ferrying goods across the length of the North China Plain, and connecting its width by way of Zhengzhou.\n\nIn the years since its construction the railway has fallen on hard times, and so while the Belgians are long gone it will take a great deal of investment to restore its infrastructure and integrate it with our new national railway services. Of course, we could always ask Mantetsu to do it free of charge."
fengtian.193.d.jinpu:0 "Financed by British and German capital nearly fifteen years before the Weltkrieg, the Jinpu Railway runs north-to-south from Tianjin to Pukou, a district of Nanjing. Like the Jinghan Railway, it has long served as one of China's most important logistical arteries, connecting north with south, and east with west by way of Xuzhou.\n\nIn the years since the last Zhifeng War the sections of the railway in Shandong and Jiangsu gradually fell under the sway of the German AOG, which updated and expanded its infrastructure. However, as the company's employees have now been driven away or shot as Hanjian they will need to be replaced. Unfortunately the process of finding and paying these individuals, not to mention re-integrating the railway itself, could prove a costly enterprise. Of course, we could always ask Mantetsu to do it free of charge."
fengtian.193.d.yuehan:0 "The Yuehan Railway, connecting Hankou and Guangdong, was born amid a conflict between Belgian and American investors, and as such took abnormally long to complete once both parties pulled out of the project. The railway was ultimately completed under the supervision of the German AOG in the early 1930s, and remained under their control until the collapse of Sun Chuanfang's League.\n\nWith the Germans gone it will need entirely new management and integration into the new national railway system. This will be an expensive task, though we could always ask Mantetsu to do it for us."

Already the elite have turned up their noses, and while force might be an easy answer, we do need these intellectuals, landlords, and businessmen to forward our greater aims.

Supposedly the institution's store of medals and rank insignia was discovered shortly after its capture, creating several self-declared colonels, majors, and generals, each belonging to a variety of self-awarded honorable orders.

The subsequent orgy of looting has seen railway traffic in the area backed up for days, as every last car has been ransacked, and while we have seized a certain amount of military equipment from the cars, the majority are now wrecked and unusable.

Looting began almost immediately, but fortunately some of our officers were able to limit the activity to only half of the rail cars, with the officers themselves taking only a further quarter.

Now they are sweeping across the province's rural regions, and having 'defected' to our side, are claiming the spoils of a war they never won.\n\nOur own troops, feeling cheated, are now engaging in competitive looting and destruction, occasionally escalating into localized but coordinated battles. The planned arrival of some more orderly troops to the area ought to calm tensions so that the actual bandits can be rounded up, but the damage is already done.

Despite their initial reservations, the men seem to feel that the heartfelt gratitude of the laborers and their families made it well worth the effort, and praise by national newspapers has offset most political fallout from the disaster itself.\n\nTo add to the positive turn of events, an assortment of weapons crates were brought up by the grateful miners, which had apparently been stashed there during the enemy's retreat not so long ago."

Today, her people are powerless, and her rulers without integrity, thus allowing the slow degradation of the national condition, and the return to a state of total subservience to Western nations. These old ways are sapping China's national strength, shaking her national foundations, and subjugating her people.\n\nIt is thus that we find ourselves in the North, as the final bastion of all that our predecessors struggled to build, and the bearers of the future of a new China. The regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] government likes to say that, by fortifying the Northeast, we are 'digging a hole to die in'. To this I say 'Forget not what happened in Ju'. It was to Ju that the State of Qi retreated, and from there that it reconquered all that it had lost. When the time is right, the Northeast will be our Ju, and the whole of China will be our Qi.

On our part, we should hold fast, fix our eyes steadfastly on our goal, and be firm in our determination. The entire Northeast should carry on with oneness of heart. The final victory will be ours. I urge my ministers, our army, and our people to redouble their efforts in order to attain success.\n\nIt is in this spirit, that I proclaim the beginning of the Year of Righteous Effort, a full three hundred and sixty five days of strenuous national effort, from which we shall emerge as a force unstoppable in the pursuit of our goal.

fengtian.289.t:0 "A Sinister Plot"
fengtian.289.d:0 "An unusual notice has made it's way to the government's attention, passed along by Kenji Doihara, whose clandestine operations are well known within our intelligence circles. Apparently Yang Yuting, an influential and notably pro-Japanese general within the Fengtian Army, is plotting the overthrow and assassination of Zhang Zuolin. The move seems to have been spurred by Zhang's decision to grant his son the presidency, which may simply reflect factional squabbling, but the appointment has already been concerning for many in the War Ministry. Zhang Xueliang's anti-Japanese sentiments are well known, and should he seize any real power there could be consequences for our relationship with the Fengtian Government, and our long-laid plans in China as a whole.\n\n"We could choose to support Yang Yuting's power grab, and he is a well known friend to Japan. On the other hand some in the Foreign Ministry are advising caution, and alleging that this entire operation is a product of meddling by our own units based in Manchuria. The Kwantung Army has long been known to have far more assertive foreign policy inclinations than the government in Tokyo."

fengtian.290.d:0 "In the middle of a busy Shenyang street, Zhang Zuolin's custom-built armor-plated car suddenly came under fire as a small bomb exploded under its wheels. The vehicle was thrown violently upward, and then careened into a nearby tailor's shop. A shootout immediately began as ambushers on both sides of the street began to open fire on the car's surviving occupants, and by the time reinforcements arrived almost fifteen minutes later its owner had suffered various burns and injuries by both shrapnel and bullets. Zhang Zuolin's life now hangs in the balance."

fengtian.291.d:0 "Zhang Zuolin was suddenly and unexpectedly struck down by assassins on Shenyang's Zhaode main street only a matter of hours ago. It was his leadership that served to underpin the entirety of the Fengtian Clique and its government, and now the power vacuum left in his wake threatens to swallow the entirety of the Northeast. Soon every soldier and officer, every contact and associate of the Old Marshal, must question his loyalties and pick a side - if there are even to be sides at all. As of now two loose factions seem set to emerge: a collection of loyalists and nationalists beneath Zhang Xueliang's banner, facing a number of Japanese-educated officers and opportunists aligned with Yang Yuting, who almost certainly had some role to play in Zuolin's assassination. Whoever strikes a decisive blow first will be entitled to Zhang Zuolin's legacy."

fengtian.292.d:0 "After convincing the remnants of the cabinet and most of the general staff to take his side, either through persuasion or more coercive means, Zhang Xueliang has emerged as the sole victor following his father's untimely demise. Yang Yuting, meanwhile, has been politically defeated, and soon retreated to a safe-house outside Shenyang to recoup his losses and take stock of the situation.\n\nYang still holds influence with a number of the Fengtian Army's most talented commanders, and so he may be betting on Zhang Xueliang's willingness to compromise and worry that, without them, he may fall behind his enemies elsewhere in China, or even in Japan."

fengtian.293.t:0 "A Mystery"
fengtian.293.d.zuolin:0 "As the fires on Zhaode Main Street are put out and the bodies recovered from the rubble, the exact identity and motivation of the attackers remains a mystery. With no uniforms to identify them, and no central database for photographic identification, these men could be from anywhere, and acting at anyone's orders. Some may have escaped amid the chaos, and might be tracked down, but such efforts will take weeks or months if they yield anything at all.\n\nWe must count ourselves fortunate that Zhang Zuolin survived the attack, against all odds." #Zuolin's POV

An auspicious day has been selected for the funeral, and already the streets are lined with citizens paying their respects, or simply caught up in the moment. Before them passes an impressive funeral cortege, replete with all the Old Marshal's earthly possessions rendered in paper, so that they may be burned and carried with him up to heaven. Eventually the pallbearers will reach a stone mausoleum outside Shenyang, where the story of this once-bandit who came to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Presidents and Emperors will finally come to an end.

fengtian.295.t:0 "The Purge of the Shikan Clique"
fengtian.295.d:0 "The invitation to play cards came as something of a surprise to Yang Yuting, who had expected a more formal summons. Nontheless, he interpreted the letter as a good sign - perhaps Zhang Xueliang had seen the light and decided to negotiate. He might be taking a risk by walking into the Young Marshal's arms, but it was one he had to take.\n\nHis car arrived at Zhang's mansion in the early evening, and upon entering main hall he received a bullet to the back of the head. There would be no negotiating after all.\n\nThe Shikan Clique has subsequently been dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals will be allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence. The Fengtian Army's cohesion has taken a great blow today, but there could be no other answer."

Zhang's own bodyguard, a Japanese exile by the name of Araki Goro, admitted the Kwantung Army's attempts to involve him in the assassination attempt, and explained that the plan had backing from Tokyo.

Though this is an embarassing moment for us, as few expected him to survive or much less discover our involvement, it is also one of crisis.

There is no easy way out of this mess." #Zuolin alive
fengtian.297.d.xueliang:0 "Much to our surprise Zhang Xueliang, believed by most to be an opium-riddled bohemian, has not only prevailed against Yang Yuting but also discovered our involvement in his father's assassination. His fury is not difficult to read, and today the Young Marshal denounced our actions before the world. Though this is an embarassing moment for us, we cannot take this direct challenge lying down. Yet aggressive action would destroy our only partnership on the Chinese mainland, and render the whole of the country hostile once again. There is no easy way out of this mess." #Xueliang took over

fengtian.298.t:0 "The Zhaode Dajie Incident"
fengtian.298.d:0 "It seems that the attack on Zhaode Main Street was carried out at the behest of none other than Yang Yuting, leader of the Shikan Clique. After his agents' simultaneous plans were foiled across the country, Yang retreated to a safehouse outside Shenyang. From there he may have intended to flee or fight back, but ultimately it didn't matter. Once it became known that Yang had taken up residence, the structure was levelled by heavy artillery at Zhang's own direction. A body, which may or may not have been Yang's, was pulled from the wreckage, its head decapitated and placed on a pike.\n\nFrom there Shikan Clique was subsequently dismantled, taken apart man by man in a relentless but pragmatic campaign of revenge. Some generals were allowed to serve on under close watch, but even slight suspicion of involvement in the Zhaode Incident was a death sentence. The Fengtian Army's cohesion has taken a great blow as a consequence, but to such treachery there could be no other answer."

fengtian.299.t:0 "Yuting Takes Over"
fengtian.299.d:0 "Travelers attempting to enter Shenyang this evening were shocked to witness troops of the Kwantung Army rush out of the darkness and onto the roads, hurriedly deploying searchlights, sandbags, and machine guns along all the city's main thoroughfares. Soon their opposition arrived, batallions of Fengtian Army troops from Fushin, Liaoyang, and Xinmin, called there by Zhang Xueliang's plea for reinforcements. As these troops attempted to negotiate their way into the city, Yang Yuting's forces seized key positions across Shenyang in a matter of hours. By dawn, and with the Japanese troops refusing to budge, the Young Marshal's resistance had been crushed, and Japan announced its intent to 'safeguard regional security' by deploying additional troops in the area. Unable to break the deadlock and now threatened by crack Japanese divisions, loyalist units around the city peeled away and broke apart - mirroring others across the country as Japanese troops soon swept across the region.\n\nThe Fengtian Government is, for all intents and purposes, dead. With Yang Yuting at the helm it has become just another Japanese puppet, meaning that its allies have broken away and its political support has collapsed. The way forward is unclear."
fengtian.299.a:0 "A new era."

fengtian.300.t:0 "A Puppet in Manchuria"
fengtian.300.d:0 "All our best efforts in Manchuria have come to fruition. With Zhang Zuolin dead and Zhang Xueliang out of the picture, Yang Yuting should prove a pliable puppet suited to our purposes. While we may no longer have an easy route to control of China as a whole, we have safeguarded our own security. Without Manchurian resources our economy would founder, and from there an enemy could easily take Korea, then plunge a dagger into the heart of Japan. This is how history is made."
fengtian.300.a:0 "Excellent!"

fengtian.301.t:0 "The End of Fengtian"
fengtian.301.d:0 "The situation in Manchuria appears dire. With Zhang's death, the Fengtian Government has essentially collapsed upon itself, and if we do not intervene their enemies will soon overrun them, invalidating all our work to make Manchuriua secure. This region is our national lifeline, our guarantee against Western hegemony, and it is under our protection."

fengtian.305.t:0 "Whispers from Tokyo"
fengtian.305.d:0 "Word has come from our spies in Tokyo - the Japanese may be preparing for war. Supposedly our Manchurian enemies have requested Japanese assistance in their war against us, which is now under consideration by the Imperial Cabinet and General Headquarters. On the one hand this news is a tacit acknowledgement by Fengtian that it has lost all claim to legitimacy, direct reliance on Japan is a political blow from which it may never recover, but on the other hand it is deeply troubling. Even now Japan's vast imperial war machine may be rumbling to life, to be stopped only by the most resolute defense."
fengtian.305.a:0 "We shall learn of their decision soon."

fengtian.306.t:0 "Attacks on the South Manchuria Railway"
fengtian.306.d:0 "Left to their own devices for over two weeks, the loyalists in Harbin launched a series of coordinated attacks along the South Manchurian Railway. Fortunately some of our commanders acted on their own initiative and, with help from Japanese Railway Zone guards, were able to limit the damage and push the outnumbered enemy back into the city.\n\nWhat followed was a brutal street-by-street fight across the city, one which the loyalists had obviously prepared for, and our casualties mounted quickly. In a final act of defiance, the enemy detonated explosives inside several factories, but by daybreak silence ruled the city - broken only by occasional gunshots marking the executions of survivors.\n\nHarbin is ours once again."
fengtian.306.a:0 "At least they're dealt with"

fengtian.307.t:0 "A Meeting with Merchants"
fengtian.307.d:0 "The Fengtian Chamber of Commerce represents the interests of numerous merchants in Shenyang and across the Northeast, most of whom are responsible for the proper functioning of our economy - at least those parts of it still outside Japanese hands. Their bargaining power is considerable, and with new authorities in the capital, they are hoping for a new deal that better serves themselves.\n\nZhang Zuolin famously shot several merchants and bankers for refusing him favorable terms, but doing the same now would set a poor precedent for our new administration - one supposedly introducing order and civilization to a war-weary China.\n\nHowever, it would set an equally bad precedent to accept terms worse than our predecessor."
fengtian.307.a:0 "Perhaps we can grease some palms"
fengtian.307.b:0 "Maybe Zhang had the right idea"
fengtian.307.c:0 "Never mind for now"

fengtian.308.t:0 "Restoring Order to Manchuria"
fengtian.308.d:0 "Despite the death of 'Grand Marshal' Zhang Zuolin, some of his legacy yet remains. Various civilian authorities across the region have either ignored or refused the order to recognize our new administration, and some still loyal to his cause have reportedly been coalescing in Harbin - perhaps to make a last stand.\n\nFor the time being our resources will be more limited than we might prefer, and we should focus our efforts on returning control and good government to Manchuria. The last remnants of Zhang's government must be swept away."
fengtian.308.a:0 "Onward!"

fengtian.309.t:0 "Pressing North"
fengtian.309.d:0 "With the threat at Harbin eliminated, our Japanese advisors have recommended that we advance north along the railway. These frigid regions of Manchuria, themselves as large as some European countries put together, were beyond even Zhang Zuolin's direct control at times and again prove troublesome.\n\nOur greatest concern, however, ought to be the Russians, who have on occasion tested our borders and notoriously covet the Chinese Eastern Railway - seized from them over a decade ago. The Japanese want the Russians checked at the Amur."
fengtian.309.a:0 "It will be done"

fengtian.310.t:0 "Monarchism Rises Within the Concordia Association"
fengtian.310.d:0 "In the turmoil since Yang Yuting’s coup, all sense of political stability has gone out the window, and much of Fengtian has been thrown into chaos. Among this chaos, many fresh political ideologies and beliefs have begun to sprout once more - none more prevalent than the desire for the return of dynastic monarchical rule. Most commonly seen within the wings of the Concordia Association, these Manchurian monarchists believe that only through the stabilizing force of a monarchy based along the old dynastic system can truly manage the unruly beast that is China. Seeing the Qing as nothing more than a decaying, corrupt dynasty that has sullied the Manchu name, these Dynasists instead desire a new face to sit on the Dragon Throne, tho who that shall be is still hotly debated within their camp. Before that can even be decided, these monarchist zealots must first seize power, and to do that they must convince the rest of the Concordia Association that this is the only way to save the Fengtian government."

fengtian.310.b:0 "Dynastic rule is only natural for the people of China."

fengtian.311.t:0 "Republican Elements Outraged"
fengtian.311.d:0 "With the Concordia Association’s decision to fully drift towards the ideas of monarchism and dynastic rule, the many varied republican elements within the Fengtian Government have begun to decry this act as tyranny and a return to outdated and archaic traditions - ones they claim will hamstring China for an eternity while their republican movement would be a so-claimed ticket to modern utopia. We laugh at these false hopes and naive dreams! Only we know that China requires a strong, regal hand to keep its unruly masses in check and safe, both from foreign enemies and themselves."
fengtian.311.a:0 "Let them howl into the wind. We have a destiny to fulfil!"

fengtian.312.t:0 "Who Shall Take Our Throne?"
fengtian.312.d:0 "Now that the Concordia Association has brought the righteous ideals of monarchism back to the Fengtian government, now comes the herculean task of choosing who shall be the monarch we rally around as we endeavor to retake Beijing and place our chosen candidate on the Dragon Throne. For this decision, two main camps have formed within the Concordia Association. The nativist camp seeks to restore a candidate of true Chinese blood not of the Qing dynasty to position of emperor, casting off the disgrace that has been Pu-Yi and the Qing in Beijing and redeeming the idea of a Chinese monarchy in the eyes of the people since the tyranny and madness of the Hongxian Emperor Yuan Shikai. Alternatively, the Japanophiles instead seek to place a member of the Japanese Imperial Family on the throne, drawing the Fengtian Government and eventually all of China even closer into the Japanese sphere of influence. However the dark horse of the factions, mainly composed of collaborationists seeks to revive the Qing under Aisin Gioro Xianyu, better known to us as Yoshiko Kawashima, a Manchu noblewoman said to have had great sympathy with our cause. Whichever faction wins out shall seek to claim the Mandate of Heaven from Pu-Yi and the false warlords of the Middle Kingdom until we, the Manchu, and our Japanese allies are the true masters of China."

Though this move would likely anger millions of Chinese citizens, they are in no position to argue, bargain, or even fight back. While it would be only right for the emperor himself to take the dragon throne, we still have the choice of whom should be the representitive of the Imperial Family's rule once they are coronated as the new Emperor of China?"

A true ethnic Chinese by blood, he was seen as the safe choice by many within the congress, who felt that a Japanese national sitting on the Dragon Throne would cause far more chaos than order - the exact opposite of the intent of this plan to unify China. With the coronation underway, Zhu Yuxun shall take on the name of the first Ming emperor to give honor to the dynasty he is about to resurrect, and China, under the new Emperor Hóngwú shall be the new unifying force of the Fengtian Government as they prepare to retake this new emperor’s throne in Beijing."

We must band together behind this new monarch if our righteous government has any hopes of surviving. Under the Shōwa Emperor and his noble regent who shall serve as his liaison and viceroy while Hirohito is at home in Japan, China shall enter a new age of prosperity as we cooperate with our Japanese neighbors for the benefit of all of East Asia."

Wu has served in the position before, and is known for his fierce opposition to the regressive [QIE.GetAdjective] monarchy, though he has also been an outspoken critic of Japanese involvement in China. As a result, he could be a vital asset in the propaganda war against [QIE.GetAdjective], or a substantial inconvenience in our complicated relationship with Japan.\n\nWu's extant ties to the Foreign Ministry and its importance to the Recovery League means that they will fight hard to ensure he gets the position, but the final decision rests with the Grand Marshal."

Jin is known to be capable, as he was once a high-ranking member of the Anhui Clique, and in the years since 1927 he has served as one of the Recovery League's more prominent members. However, his rivalry with the Communications Clique's leader Liang Shiyi is well known, and should the two come to serve together in government there is every chance of friction and perhaps even open conflict. Some are also reluctant to trust such a prominent member of the former Anhui Clique in such a high office.\n\nShould either prove too concerning, the Grand Marshal could of course prevent the appointment."

His most important relationships, however, are with the railway unions, which work with the Communications Clique to oppose Mantetsu and Japanese influence in return for rights, benefits, and control over the workplace.\n\nLi is known to be silently competent, but the Grand Marshal can always choose to prevent the appointment."

However, some may yet be swayed to our side during this conflict. We must reach out to the Anqing Clique to the south, which has just come out victorious against the League and hope to immediately get them to join our side. We cannot afford the resources now to aid them in reconstruction, as we are already occupied with the war."
fngshen.1.a:0 "Send the invitations."

fngshen.2.t:0 "Invited to the Shenyang Conference"
fngshen.2.ddef:0 "Today we formally received an invitation to the Shenyang Conference hosted by [From.GetNameDef]. Its goal is to allow us to improve our coordination in future conflicts and create a broader cooperation between [From.GetCliqueShortName] and the other powers across China. As we have nothing to lose by accepting their friendly invitation and participating in the conference, we will accept and attend."
fngshen.2.danq:0 "We have received an invitation to the Shenyang Conference hosted by [From.GetNameDef]. They hope to discuss important issues related to us joining their Reclamation War against [QIE.GetNameDef], which has already begun. As they aided us in our conflict to reunite the Five Provinces, we should hear them out. They have also let us know they currently cannot spare any resources to aid us in our reconstruction, as they are fully occupied with the war."
fngshen.2.a:0 "Send a delegation."

fngshen.3.t:0 "[FROM.GetName] Agrees to the Conference"
fngshen.3.d:0 "Good news! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has replied to our invitation and they have agreed to attend the Conference. We can expect their delegation to arrive soon."
fngshen.3.d1:0 "Good news! [FROM.GetNameDefCap] has replied to our invitation and they have agreed to attend the Conference. We can expect their delegation to arrive soon. However, we must note that their current loyalties lie with [ANQ.GetLeader] as Anqing took Shandong in the League War and puppeted them. They have promised the province to us once the war begins, however."
fngshen.3.a:0 "Excellent."

fngshen.4.t:0 "Negotiations with the Federalists?"
fngshen.4.d.no_allies:0 "Our diplomatic state currently leaves much to be desired. Besides Japan, we have no natural allies in the region that would be able to cooperate with us against [QIE.GetNameDef]. This leaves us with the unorthodox but still present possibility of approaching the Federalists to support us. While they are anything but insignificant, we certainly have our fair share of ideological differences. Be that as it may - if we can bridge them, they could become a potent ally in the conflict ahead."
fngshen.4.d.conference:0 "While we have gained ground with our recent diplomatic efforts, the question of whether or not to engage the Federalists has been raised by some of our advisers. While we have our fair share of ideological differences, they argue that our growing strength and influence should allow us to overcome this hurdle and add another ally to our ranks. Thanks to our other successes however, we could always decline to do so and spare ourselves from their inevitable demands."
fngshen.4.a:0 "Let's try to find common ground."
fngshen.4.b:0 "Don't bother."

fngshen.5.t:0 "An Offer from [From.GetCliqueShortName]"
fngshen.5.d.no_allies:0 "Today we received a message from [From.GetNameDef] where they wish to invite us to discuss possible cooperation against the [QIE.GetNameDef]. While we don't see eye to eye on a lot of issues, we can perhaps attribute their more welcoming tone as a result of the broader isolation that they're suffering from. Given their lack of friends in the region, attending would allow us to encourage them to agree to sorely needed reforms in exchange for our helping hand. How should we reply?"
fngshen.5.d.conference:0 "In a rather surprising development, [From.GetCliqueShortName] has invited us to attend their conference in Shenyang. Their goal is to create a broad coalition against [QIE.GetNameDef]. So far, they seem to have had some success in bringing the other warlords on board. Perhaps if we attended, we could get them to agree to undertake some sorely needed reforms. How should we respond to their invitation?"
fngshen.5.a:0 "Very well, let's go to Shenyang."
fngshen.5.b:0 "We don't trust them."

fngshen.6.t.accepted:0 "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Agrees to the Conference"
fngshen.6.d.accepted:0 "Good news! [From.GetLeader] has replied to our invitation to attend the Shenyang Conference. He has agreed to attend the conference and we should expect a Federalist delegation to arrive in short order."
fngshen.6.a:0 "Excellent."

fngshen.6.t.refused:0 "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Refuses our Offer"
fngshen.6.d.refused:0 "Perhaps unsurprisingly, [From.GetLeader] has refused our olive branch. In the letter he sent in reply to our invitation, he cited the Japanese influence as the primary reason, claiming that he doubted our ability to speak for ourselves rather than simply doing Tokyo's bidding."
fngshen.6.b:0 "Their loss."

fngshen.7.t:0 "Start of the Shenyang Conference"
fngshen.7.d:0 "The big day has finally arrived. Delegates have arrived to discuss [From.GetCliqueShortName]'s initiative against the regime in Beijing. A brief opening ceremony was held, culminating in an introductory speech by Zhang Zuolin. Everyone's in good spirit, though no one doubts the diplomatic challenges that lie ahead."
fngshen.7.a:0 "Let's begin."

fngshen.8.t:0 "Heated Discussions"
fngshen.8.d:0 "Everyone knew that [ANQ.GetLeader]and [SQI.GetLeader] would have a hard time cooperating given their mutual dislike. Unfortunately, they've allowed this turn into a public dispute that has already disrupted the talks. Zhang in particular has caused a scene as his mannerisms are enough to make even the most hardened warlord raise an eyebrow. We can only hope that this won't set a trend as the conference goes on."
fngshen.8.a:0 "Cut it out, both of you!"

fngshen.9.t:0 "Federalists Press for Reforms"
fngshen.9.d:0 "As expected from the Federalists, [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] has been attempting to pressure Zhang Zuolin to adopt reforms. The aim of these would be the gradual liberalization of [From.GetCliqueShortName] and ideally - for him - that these reforms at the head would trickle down to influence the other warlords as well. It's clear that the Federalists aren't prepared to support Zhang without getting something in return."
fngshen.9.a:0 "Make vague promises."

fngshen.10.t:0 "The Anti-Concessionist Question"
fngshen.10.d.ANQ:0 "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to make any definitive pledges on the matter so far, but that hasn't made the issue go away. It's evident that this won't last long if the conference is to move forward."
fngshen.10.d.GXC:0 "Fierce opponents of the Concessions to the colonial powers, the [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegation has been actively pressuring Fengtian to accept a firm stance against the Concessions. They've been supported in this endeavor by the Federalists, who are equally defiant against the Concessions albeit from a more liberal position. While Zhang Zuolin has been reluctant to state an official position on the matter so far, he's likely to be forced to do so soon. As the influence that the two Chens wield is gaining momentum, this issue isn't likely to go away."
fngshen.10.a:0 "They might have a point..."

fngshen.11.t:0 "[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] Find Common Ground"
fngshen.11.d:0 "United by a staunch Anti-Concessionist platform, the two Chens of [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] and [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] have formed what's essentially a bloc in the conference. With broad support for their positions, Zhang Zuolin's undeclared position is becoming more and more untenable by the hour."
fngshen.11.a:0 "This may be a problem."

fngshen.12.t:0 "Zongchang's Drunken Rants"
fngshen.12.d:0 "After drinking Sake by what we can only assume to be the barrel-load, [SQI.GetLeader] has created a scene today as he slurred and yelled his way through a drunken tirade. What little could be understood of his ravings were nothing short of a love letter to Japan with only his love for Japanese booze and women being comprehended by the hostage audience, if only through repetition. Most of Zhang's incomprehensible ravings were, for better or for worse, impossible to understand, which may have been a blessing in disguise.\n\nAfter creating a spectacular scene, he got up on his chair and put one boot down on the table. Before he could be made to sit down again, he declared a toast to Japan, with the rest of his speech sounded more like a man struggling to hold back vomit than actual words. To say that this has created a negative atmosphere among the conference attendants would be the understatement of the decade."
fngshen.12.a:0 "Stop embarassing us!"

fngshen.13.t:0 "Yang Yuting Urges Caution"
fngshen.13.d:0 "With Anti-Concessionist sentiments rising, Yang Yuting has come forward to urge Zuolin to be cautious with regards to the stance on the Concessions. Because of Japan's strong interests in them, particularly through its China Agency in the Legation Cities, they stand to lose greatly if we went ahead and declared ourselves to be against the Concessions. Because of our healthy and mutually beneficial cooperation, alienating them would be seen by Tokyo as not merely an insult, but naked aggression against them.\n\nWhile hardly unexpected, Yuting's actions prove that Japan is worried about our eventual decision. If nothing else, it's a reminder that they will not sit idly by if we join the Anti-Concessionist movement."
fngshen.13.a:0 "A fair warning."

fngshen.14.t:0 "The Point of Decision"
fngshen.14.d:0 "Facing insurmountable pressure from his potential partners, Zuolin must decide whether he agrees to the Anti-Concessionist stance that has overtaken the conference or tries to argue against them. Siding against the Anti-Concessionists would severely hinder our chances of forming a strong alliance. Adopting an Anti-Concessionist stance, however, would severely anger Tokyo."
fngshen.14.a:0 "Very well, we accept."
fngshen.14.b:0 "We cannot afford angering Japan."

FNG_federalist_allies:0 "§GThe Federalists will join our efforts against [QIE.GetNameDef]!§!"

FNG_anqing_angered:0 "§R[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] will be greatly angered by this decision!§!"

fngshen.15.t:0 "The Federalist-[FNG.GetCliqueShortName] Alliance"
fngshen.15.d:0 "It wasn't easy to overcome the numerous differences between us. In the end though, pragmatism won out and enough common ground was found to make this unlikely friendship a reality. [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] and the Federalists of [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetCliqueShortName] are now on the same side following a long series of secretive negotiations. Let us hope that this alliance stands the test of time."
fngshen.15.a:0 "Excellent."

fngshen.16.t:0 "[ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] Thanks Us"
fngshen.16.d:0 "We've received official word from [ANQ.GetLeader] that they are happy we took an Anti-Concessionist stance. However, they have not yet weighed all the matters concerning their decision to join us in our Reclamation War. We await their final decision."
fngshen.16.a:0 "We'll have to wait."

fngshen.17.t:0 "End of the Conference"
fngshen.17.d:0 "Although there was no shortage of hurdles to overcome along the way, diplomacy has won the day. The Shenyang Conference has ended in a success for [Root.GetCliqueShortName], cementing their position in the region at the expense of the Beijing government. The delegates left the city after a cordial closing ceremony. Zhang Zuolin is now several steps closer to turning his ambitions into reality."
fngshen.17.danq:0 "Although there was no shortage of hurdles to overcome along the way, diplomacy has won the day. The Shenyang Conference has ended in a success for [Root.GetCliqueShortName], cementing their position in the region at the expense of the Beijing government. The delegates left the city after a cordial closing ceremony. It is now up to us if we will indeed put our weight behind Zhang Zuolin and join his Reclamation War."
fngshen.17.a:0 "Next stop: Beijing!"
fngshen.17.b:0 "We'll make the right decision."

fngshen.18.t:0 "The Federalists Storm Off"
fngshen.18.d:0 "Finding a compromise on the Concessions proved to be an insurmountable task. It was simply politically impossible for the Federalists to make a complete U-turn on the matter, while Zhang's refusal to budge is being publicly mocked as a simple refusal to bite the hand that feeds it. After publicly denouncing the conference as a sham, the Federalist delegation led by [FNG_shenyang_federalist_leader.GetLeader] left the conference. Any chance for an alliance between them and [Root.GetCliqueShortName] is now likely an outright impossibility."
fngshen.18.a:0 "This will be trouble."

fngshen.19.t:0 "Zuolin Refuses Our Demands"
fngshen.19.d:0 "Evidently, Zuolin simply could not bite the hand that fed him. By declaring his opposition to the anti-Concessionists, he's showed his colors for all of China to see. There's absolutely no way we can side with [From.GetCliqueShortName] under these circumstances. While we'd hoped that he'd see reason, we can't say we're surprised either. Our delegation left the conference earlier today, leaving Zuolin with his Japanese cronies."
fngshen.19.a:0 "What to expect from a Japanese puppet?"

fngshen.20.t:0 "[From.GetCliqueShortName] Refuses to Denounce the Concessions"
fngshen.20.d:0 "Despite our best efforts, our delegates could not convince Zuolin to stand against the concessions. We'll not let this go lightly, but we must not commit any rash actions and immediately denounce Zuolin. Let us look at the factors and decide whether or not to join Zuolin in his Reclamation War against Beijing."
fngshen.20.a:0 "Unfortunate."

fngshen.21.t:0 "Tiaoyuan Decides His Position"
fngshen.21.d:0 "The [FNG.GetCliqueShortName] stance on the Concessionist question greatly angered [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName]'s Chen Tiaoyuan. However, [ANQ.GetCliqueShortName] delegates have informed us that the decision whether or not they will join our war against Beijing and enter into an alliance with us has yet to be made. We eagerly await their final answer."
fngshen.21.a:0 "We must be patient."

With this victory we have taken the first major step toward national reunification, and resumed our role as an active contender for national leadership.\n\nIntending to seize the moment, Marshal Zhang has ordered his staff to begin assembling a plan for the peaceful unification of China. If put into motion - and more importantly, agreed upon - it would see the remaining provinces in China united without any further bloodshed, raising the legitimacy of our government immeasurably. The plan is not without its opponents, of course, as some politicians doubt an undertaking of this scale can be accomplished, while some members of the military believe that diplomacy will only prevent the formation of a strong central authority and leave the country again united in name only.\n\nWe must carefully consider this decision, as the stroke of a pen here could have a far bigger impact than any order the Old Marshal has given in his long and storied career."

Its leader, Marshal Zhang Zuolin, has called for a national conference to discuss what he calls 'the peaceful unification of China'. Supporters of the notion emphasize unity in the face of Western imperialism, whereas the detractors cite everything from Zuolin's dependence on Japanese support to the very structure of the Fengtian Government.\n\nPast disagreements and disputes aside, the fact that the winds are blowing in Zhang Zuolin's direction means that we wouldn't lose face by attending, but simply attending might grant him legitimacy."

Evidently, they're far more interested in bickering over what they lost when the Manchu fell from prominence rather than uniting for the good of China."

fngconf.4.d:0 "In response to our recently announced plan to hold a conference for the unification of China, a Kuomintang representative has publicly denounced us and declared that the party will boycott our initiative. Denouncing us as warlords, bandits, and Japanese running dogs, they're already calling the conference illegitimate and intend to ignore whatever negotiated document it might produce.

fngconf.5.d.JAP:0 "We have received word that our friends in Shenyang are arranging a conference aiming to unite China under the Fengtian Government. With the winds clearly blowing in his direction, Zhang Zuolin believes that this is the best opportunity to pull the country together, as no one else can legitimately claim to be able to fill the power vacuum left in the wake of former Beijing government's collapse.\n\nSubsequently, we need to decide what our role in the conference, if any, should be. While we naturally cannot be represented by regular delegates, many in the Foreign Ministry have suggested that we should demand observer status. While we would not have any voting rights, some are arguing that our presence would support claims that Zhang Zuolin is operating at our behest, and thus undermine both our positions in China. The rest, however, seem to agree that our reasons to attend are legitimate, and that we shouldn't be held captive by the irrational fears of Chinese nationalists. After all, should this conference begin to develop in a direction contrary to Japanese interests, it would be best to know first hand - and perhaps to tip the balance in our favor."

Chen Jiongming's ideals and our government's practices have relatively little in common, but there is room for compromise. Chen's presence would grant the federalists a major say in the conference's outcome, but not allowing him to attend could make the process seem illegitimate to some."

fngconf.7.d:0 "The third wife of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, Song Qingling has previously served as the leading figurehead for the Left-Kuomtintang, and granted the movement her husband's legitimacy even beyond his deathbed. With her organization militarily defeated, Song could pass the same legitimacy on to us, if at the cost of some concessions to her socialist ideals. Nontheless, members of the Concordia Association, the Communications Clique, and even some of the Old Marshal's loyalists are urging us not to invite such a radical firebrand into our midst."

fngconf.11.t:0 "Tiaoyuan's Speech"
fngconf.11.d:0 "In Beijing, one of the key moments on today's agenda was a speech given by Chen Tiaoyuan, the former governor of Anhui Province who rose to prominence during the collapse of the League of Eight Provinces. He congratulated the Fengtian government's efforts under [FNG.GetLeader] to resist German imperialism, as well as their many lackeys who put the interests of foreigners ahead of fellow Chinese, but warned that he expects the same stubborn resistance against any other foreign aggressors. The speech was met with applause from every corner of the chamber, though some interpreted the speech as a subtle criticism of Zhang Zuolin's ties to the Japanese."

fngconf.12.t:0 "Question Of The Constitution"
fngconf.12.d.federalist:0 "As the conference started, the first order of this day was the proposed creation of a new constitution. The proposal would clearly outline the rights and powers given to both the people and the government, but not everyone is pleased. Chen Jiongming has expectedly proven a full-throated critic of the proposal in its present form, which he claims would grant too much power to the nation's executive. Instead he would prefer the restoration of the suspended 1923 constitution, which is widely considered China's most liberal to date. The federalist bloc quickly lined up behind Chen, and this will no doubt remain a thorny issue as the conference goes on."
fngconf.12.d.no_federalist:0 "As the conference started, the first order of this day was the proposed creation of a new constitution. While it may not be what everyone wanted, it seems to be something everyone can agree on, or at the very least accept, as it clearly defines the rights, powers and limitations set on the government's branches. After some debate and a few proposed amendments, it seems like it's broadly being agreed upon. Some commenters have noted that the relative equanimity shown is a sign that few present plan to follow the constitution's actual tenets in the long term."
fngconf.12.a:0 "The debate begins."
fngconf.12.b:0 "Interesting."

fngconf.13.t:0 "Disagreements With The Federalists"
fngconf.13.d:0 "Disagreements over the constitution have been center floor to the confernce virtually since its start, and now the Federalists have been joined by other delegates who, while they may not share the same concerns as the Federalists, have used this opportunity to get some of their more minor concerns addressed.\n\nWhile they would likely have accepted the proposed constitution it as it was, the staunch opposition mounted by the Federalists over this issue has allowed them to join forces and form a sizable albeit informal opposition bloc in the conference halls, large enough to hold up the rest of the conference. It would seem that proceedings have stalled until either side budges or offers a compromise."
fngconf.13.a:0 "We need a solution."
fngconf.13.b:0 "This could be a problem."

fngconf.14.t:0 "A Compromise Is Proposed"
fngconf.14.d.FNG:0 "After days of vigorous debate, a compromise was finally reached reached between the parties, which they're now presenting to us. The 1923 constitution will be broadly restored as it is but with clear checks on a weakened executive along with a centralized army. To accept this compromise Chen Jiongming demands the position of Prime Minister under Zhang Xueliang as President. Under this proposal, Zhang Zuolin would also get the title of Grand Marshal of the army.\n\nWhile it's a tough pill to swallow, it's unlikely that we'll get a much better deal out of them. As such, many in our camp are suggesting that we accept it as even a handful of defections could give their bloc a majority. Others are, however, insisting that we should call the Federalists bluff and that Chen's demands to be the prime minister are unreasonable. How should we act?"
fngconf.14.d.others:0 "After days of negotiations, a compromise has been reached. The restoration of the 1923 constitution will go ahead with more checks on the executive and a centralized army. Under this deal, Jiongming will be the Prime Minister under Xueliang as President. This army will be headed by Zuolin as Grand Marshal.\n\nWhile it isn't something everyone's happy with, it's hopefully something that everyone can agree on. We now await the response from Fengtian."
fngconf.14.a:0 "Very well, we have a deal."
fngconf.14.b:0 "This is unacceptable!"
fngconf.14.c:0 "Sounds like a nice idea."

fngconf.15.t:0 "The Federalists Leave The Conference"
fngconf.15.d.rejected:0 "With the constitutional compromise rejected, we expected the Federalists to come forward with a more rational proposal that wasn't a naked power grab by Chen Jiongming. Unfortunately, they returned after some deliberations by declaring to everyone that they were abandoning the conference while denouncing the Fengtian leaders. A portion of the conference hall is now glaringly empty without their presence. While certainly not ideal, the conference can at least go on without any further interruptions." #Non-Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.rejected_feds:0 "With Fengtian refusing to budge on the implementation of the 1923 constitution without watering it down, the Federalists have given up on trying to negotiate any further. After denouncing Zuolin's refusal to compromise, their bloc of delegates promptly left the conference hall and are already on their way out of Beijing. Though the conference continues, the numerous vacant seats in the chambers have left a scar on its legitimacy." #Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.betrayed:0 "Despite their differences a compromise between Zhang Zuolin and Chen Jiongming's Federalists might have been possible, but it was not to be. Ironically the point of contention was not ideological in any form, but instead territorial. Fengtian promised Federalist territory to another claimant, hoping to bring them on board, but in doing so Zhang unintentionally destroyed any goodwill between himself and his Federalist negotiating partners. Furious, they are already on their way out of the city." #Non-Federalist POV
fngconf.15.d.betrayed_feds:0 "Despite our differences, a compromise with Zhang Zuolin's Fengtian Government might have been possible. But, now it is clear that such dreams were simply never meant to be. In a brazen act of betrayal Zhang promised portions of our territory to another claimant, and in so doing proved himself no better than any other predatory warlord. We cannot accept such an insult, and our delegates are already planning to leave the conference tomorrow." #Federalist POV
fngconf.15.a:0 "Their loss."

fngconf.16.t:0 "Song Qingling Takes the Floor"
fngconf.16.d:0 "With her very presence at the conference controversial, the Kuomintang luminary's speech was inevitably going to draw a lot of attention. Despite the total defeat of her organization militarily, her late husband's legacy still carries with it the sympathies of many republicans and intellectuals across the country, making her support a valuable commodity - especially for Zhang Zuolin, who continues to seek external legitimacy. Predictably, Song Qingling denounced the inability of previous regimes to address the real wants and needs of the population, and declared that any truly legitimate Chinese government must succeed where its predecessors failed. Her words drew some polite applause from other delegates, but there's no doubt that her eventual proposed reforms will prove controversial with the more conservative delegates."
fngconf.16.a:0 "Let's see what she proposes."

fngconf.17.t:0 "The Sanmin Negotiations"
fngconf.17.d:0 "Most warlords have had a shaky relationship with the ideology of Dr. Sun Yat-sen both before and after his death in 1925. Several, including Zhang Zuolin, have at times claimed to be inheritors of his legacy, keen to draw support from his former adherents despite their own indifference to the ideas themselves. Now, however, Zhang may have to pick a side a stick with it. Among Song Qingling's demands are the formal adoption of the Three Principles of the People, which in theory would force Zhang to turn his back on the Japanese, implement democratic reforms, and commit to widespread social programs.\n\nReality suggests compromise as the only route forward, and fortunately the principles are open to interpretation. Already the Fengtian camp has indicated its willingness to support the first and third of the three principles, if the second is only nominally implemented. Zhang will promise to take a hard-line with the Japanese, fund some of Song's welfare initiatives, and place his son Xueliang as President of the Republic, so long as real power remains in his hands via the military."
fngconf.17.a:0 "An acceptable offer!"

fngconf.18.t.success:0 "The Four Principles Of The People"
fngconf.18.d.success:0 "Negotiations were tough, but in the end both parties' willingness to compromise prevailed. The promised ascendency of Zhang Zuolin and his son Xueliang has been seen by conservatives as a sufficient safeguard against radicalism, and a sign that while times are changing China's traditional values will be respected rather than uprooted.\n\nWhen all was said and done, the negotiations ended with Song expressing her gratitude towards Fengtian for their willingness to cooperate and compromise. She has pledged her personal support for Zuolin's initiative to unify China, handing him a powerful tool with which to curry legitimacy on the national stage."
fngconf.18.a:0 "Excellent."

fngconf.18.t.failure:0 "Divided Over Principles"
fngconf.18.d.failure:0 "Evidently, the number of social and political reforms required to appease Song Qiongling has proven too bitter of a pill for Fengtian and its allies to swallow, while Song herself refused to 'desecrate' the legacy of her husband with the aims of an upstart warlord and former bandit.\n\nSubsequently the negotiations ended in failure, and Song Qingling promptly left Beijing and returned to China's political wilderness. While it may not be a huge surprise that this wide ideological rift couldn't be bridged, it's nonetheless a blow to the idea of Chinese unity and Zhang Zuolin's quest for national legitimacy."

Anqing's Chen Tiaoyuan and the federalist Chen Jiongming have found common ground in their opposition to the concessions and have formed a united bloc.

By joining the anti-concessionists, we would be directly opposing our nominal friends in Tokyo, and the act would constitute a betrayal in many eyes. Be that as it may, by declaring our opposition to the anti-concessionist cause we would severely undermine our legitimacy and give ammunition to those that wish to paint us as mere puppets of the Japanese.

fngconf.32.d.beijing_lost:0 "A tense atmosphere had grown with each day as hostile forces marched closer and closer to Beijing. For a conference aimed at uniting China by the pen rather than the sword, its entire legitimacy was cast into doubt once the Fengtian Army began to retreat, ceding more and more land until Beijing itself became the front line. As the situation worsened, the city itself became a battlefield, and the wounds caused by the last battle over the ancient city were quickly reopened as gunfire and shelling marked its streets.\n\nEven before the enemy entered the city, measures were taken to evacuate the delegates, and it wasn't long until these hastily drawn evacuation plans had to be put into effect. By the end of the same week, the Fengtian Army had been chased out of the city.\n\nThe conference collapsed before the city fell, and with it disappeared any hope of the participants returning. Needless to say, this has been a profound humiliation for Zhang Zuolin. Not only has the unification initiative been an utter failure, but his armies were routed from one of the great cities of Asia while the whole world watched."
fngconf.32.a:0 "Force will unite China, then."
fngconf.32.b:0 "What a waste of time."

fngconf.33.t:0 "Zhang Zuolin Stands Defiant"
fngconf.33.d:0 "Unfortunately Fengtian has not seen reason. Zhang Zuolin has rejected our demands, insisting that the 'century of humiliation' must come to an end.\n\nThis compounded insult is absolutely unacceptable! Now even the most moderate voices are insisting that we send Zhang an ultimatum which cannot be ignored. Others, already hawkish generals among them, are insisting that we should simply invade Manchuria before Zhang can mobilise against us."
fngconf.33.a:0 "Punish them."
fngconf.33.b:0 "Force is the only answer."
fngconf.33.c:0 "Do nothing for now."

fngconf.34.t:0 "Japan is Silent"
fngconf.34.d:0 "To everyone's surprise, Japan has issued no response to our refusal of their ultimatum and an attitude they earlier labelled 'impertinent' and 'unacceptable'. Perhaps Japan is simply afraid to undermine our legitimacy, still hoping that we might serve as a bridge for them to tighten their grip over China as a whole. Or, perhaps Japan is a paper tiger, and far weaker than anyone expected."
fngconf.34.a:0 "Interesting."

fngconf.35.t:0 "Suspicious Troop Movements"
fngconf.35.d:0 "Ever since our decision to make a stand against Japan, disturbing rumors have spread across the Northeast of an impending Japanese invasion. Now observers in Jilin Province have seemingly found confirmation by reporting suspicious troop movements on the south side of the Yalu River. We must consider immediately strengthening our defences to meet the oncoming blow."
fngconf.35.a:0 "We must be ready!"

fngconf.36.t:0 "The Invasion of Manchuria"
fngconf.36.d:0 "Less than an hour ago elements of the Imperial Japanese Army crossed the Yalu River at Sinuiju, Haeju, and Rason. Declaring this a necessary measure to safeguard Japan's 'internationally recognized right to a free hand in Manchuria', and to protect its 'national lifeline', the Japanese Government has declared war in all but name. Already Japan's youth are being called upon to 'fulfill the duty of their fathers' who fought and died in Manchuria in 1905, and there can be no illusions about the seriousness or extent of this war - for us it will soon become one of survival or anhiliation."
fngconf.36.a:0 "No surrender!"

fngconf.45.t:0 "Our Time To Make Demands"
fngconf.45.d:0 "With the big questions out of the way, we're now in a position to make our demands for our cooperation. Whether it's land concessions, riches or autonomy, we should ask for what we believe is a fair price for our support. Of course, if we believe that the Fengtian cause is just, we can choose to simply offer them our unconditional support for the betterment of China."

### Focuses ###
## Cossack tree ##
URL_Military_Government: "Standoff in Uralsk"
URL_Military_Government_desc: "The conflict between Atamans Vladimir Tolstov and Mikhail Borodin, previously bubbling under the surface, finally erupted and made the entire Host shake. The war between Cossack 'brothers' must be resolved unless we want to see Uralsk collapse under the weight of its own strife."

URL_Ural_Interpretation_Of_Oblastnik: "Ural Interpretation of Regionalism"
URL_Ural_Interpretation_Of_Oblastnik_desc: "The Oblastniks are most famous for espousing the independentist idea of, and predominantly situated in, Siberia. That does not mean the regionalist ideals championed by their movement have not moved past those borders. We shall implement our own, unique, interpretation of the Oblastink ideology, focused more on the special privileges and authority that ought to be granted to the Cossacks of Ural."
URL_Question_Of_Zemstvo: "Question of the Zemstvos"
URL_Question_Of_Zemstvo_desc: ""Ever since the institution of the Zemstvo was established, nearly a century ago, it has been both a source of great relief but also controversy. While it has undeniably helped the rural population, even the Cossacks, it has allowed for certain unwanted ideas to spread. The opponents of the zemstva, ones very critical of their 'liberal' nature, would want us to shut them all down. Yet, is that the correct course of action?"
URL_Protection_Of_Old-Believers: "Protect the 'New Jerusalem'"
URL_Protection_Of_Old-Believers_desc: "The lands we have come to call our home are also a place of refuge, a haven, for the faithful persecuted by the corrupt Patriarchal establishment. The Old-Believers, having long stood against the encroachment of the reformist authority, were industrious enough to establish a true 'New Jerusalem' in Ural. We must protect those kind souls, who still observe the legacy of the Great Martyr Avvakum, from all the Nikonites that think the only correct way was the heresy of their long-dead patriarch, now rotting underneath the so-called New Jerusalem Monastery in Moscow."
URL_All_In_Name_Of_Prosperity: "All in the Name of Prosperity"
URL_All_In_Name_Of_Prosperity_desc: "We have not fought for our own state only to be stuck in hovels and desolate cities, subsisting on whatever scraps the previous overlords left. We must ensure that our people, be they Cossack or Old-Believers, enjoy the fruits of the lands now under our command. Let us work towards the newfound prosperity."
URL_Gorynychi: "The Call of the Gorynychi"
URL_Gorynychi_desc: "The current crew of the Ural Garrison has hit certain difficulties, following the clash between the Atamans and the actions of the Alash. Even if we could possibly hold on with the forces we have currently, it would still be wise to enlist the help of Cossack volunteers, the Gorynychi, for the defense of our nation."
URL_Safeguard_Our_Way_Of_Living: "Safeguard Our Way of Living"
URL_Safeguard_Our_Way_Of_Living_desc: "There shall come a time in which Uralsk will be threatened by an enemy stronger than before, one which shall only be repealed by a mass effort of both the Host and the people living under it. We must prepare for that time, strengthening our defences and training the people for the possibility of having to defend their livelihood."
URL_Secure_Dictatorship: "Secure the Dictatorship"
URL_Secure_Dictatorship_desc: "The position of the Ataman is still quite shaky, owing to the conflict he had to survive while vanquishing his greatest rival. The state shall simply vanish if the dictatorship of [ROOT.GetLeader] is not legalized and entrenched through the force of arms."
URL_Inextinguishable_Struggle_Against_Socialism: "Inextinguishable Struggle Against Socialism"
URL_Inextinguishable_Struggle_Against_Socialism_desc: "Our struggle is born with Socialism, the same disease which inflamed the Russian lands naught but two decades ago. The Marxian rot has cast the Tsardom into rebellion and civil war. Only the boldness of soldiers like us, the Cossacks, drove the Bolshevik hordes out, but their influence has never disappeared. We must hold an eternal vigil against the insidious forces trying to bewitch our population."
URL_Subordinate_Kirgiz_Population: "Subordinate the Inorodtsy"
URL_Subordinate_Kirgiz_Population_desc: "Contrary to what some may think, especially the uppity populations among the Steppe desolation, we are not mere occupiers or foreigners. These lands are as much, if not more, ours as they are the Inorodtsy. Those of 'different nation' have done nothing to modernize or maintain this region, and yet they demand full power over it. We cannot allow this insolence to continue, and thus the Alash Party and all similar organizations must be banned and their former members controlled."
URL_Negotiate_With_Alash: "Negotiate With the Alash"
URL_Negotiate_With_Alash_desc: "The Kirgiz, despite being a thorn in our side for decades, outnumber the Cossack and Russian population in Ural by a considerable amount. We won't be able to maintain order much longer if we at least don't attempt to negotiate some sort of a truce with the Alash Party's leadership."

URL_Loyalty_to_the_Ataman: "Loyalty to the Ataman"
URL_Loyalty_to_the_Ataman_desc: "The greatest mistake Borodin made was hoping that the Russians would come to his rescue, the foolish dog he was. Under the guidance of our great Ataman Vladimir Tolstov the Ural Host shall not only thrive without anyone's help, but it shall become a beacon of stability and independence for the region. It's time to hoist a new flag, the banner of the Yaik Cossack Host!"
URL_Allegiance_to_the_Motherland: "Allegiance to the Motherland"
URL_Allegiance_to_the_Motherland_desc: "Tolstov was a misguided fool, thinking that the future of the Ural Host could lead us anywhere other than the warm embrace of our Mother, our Russia. The necessity for Uralsk to remain the stragglers from the greater whole is at an end, and thus it is time to finally rejoin the Motherland on our terms."

URL_Negotiate_With_Cossacks_desc: "Although our uprising was aimed against the increasingly hostile Ural Garrison, it does not mean that we are the enemies of all Cossacks inhabiting our lands.

URL_The_Oyil_Vilayat_desc: "It would be foolish to expect that we will be able to preserve our freedom outside of the aegida of our brothers in Alash-Qala.

### Events ###
url.1.t: "The Ural Cossack Host"
url.1.d: "In late 1917, units of the Ural Cossack troops that had been deployed on the front lines returned to their homeland. Despite the Bolsheviks' vigorous efforts to disarm them, the majority of these units returned with their weapons intact. The economic, political, and spiritual values of the Ural Cossacks clashed sharply with the directives imposed by the newly established Soviet government.\n\nUnlike other Cossack groups, the Ural Cossacks did not experience generational conflicts or social stratification based on property ownership. These factors prevented the Bolsheviks from attempting to attract the Cossacks through promises of land concessions. Quite to the contrary, the Soviet government withdrew from the Cossacks was their exclusive fishing rights in the Ural River basin. In March 1918, the Cossacks disbanded the Bolshevik revolutionary committees in their area and destroyed the punitive forces dispatched to quell the uprising, establishing the Ural Military Administration. In 1919, the Cossacks of the lower Ural elected a leader, Lieutenant General Vladimir Tolstov, a native of Guryev. Under Tolstov's leadership, the Cossack forces formed the core of the Ural Army, which joined the ranks of Kolchak's troops.\n\nThe Ural Cossacks tenaciously defended their territory, occasionally inflicting significant losses on the Red Army, but their efforts were hindered by dwindling mobilization resources, mounting casualties, lack of provisions, and an acute shortage of advanced weapons such as artillery and machine guns. Fortunately, they were eventually able to link up with Kolchak's forces and the remnants of the Komuch People's Army, securing their position and pushing back the Bolshevik advance."
url.1.a: "What next?"

url.2.t: "The Ural Cossack Host"
url.2.d: "Following the conclusion of the Civil War, the Ural Cossack Host became part of the Alash Autonomy, as the newly established government in Petrograd prioritized national identity over all others. The Cossacks likewise gained autonomy but remained legally responsible to the Alash administration. Therefore, the Russian authorities endeavored to maintain control over the Steppe, yet in reality, the Cossacks failed to comply with the directives of the Alash Orda. This became particularly evident after the 1925 Kolchak Putsch, during which most Cossack forces initially supported the insurrection.\n\nThe Ural Cossacks, characterized by their reluctance to collaborate with the Alash government and their insistence on maintaining their own autonomy, operated as a self-governing entity, effectively operating outside the realm of legal regulation. With the backing of the Russian General Staff, they were able to maintain their existence in a somewhat altered form. However, it is becoming increasingly evident that the status quo needs to be reevaluated, and if the Ural Cossacks are to continue existing, it must be as something distinct from the Kazakh state."
url.2.a: "We are the Ural Cossacks!"

url.3.t: "Kazakh Self-Government in [1212.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]"
url.3.d: "Following the dissolution of the feeble Kazakh state into internal strife, we were compelled to finally sever our ties with this quasi-entity. However, it was not merely our ancestral territories that came under our control, but also the vast steppe on the eastern bank of the Ural River, which was predominantly inhabited by Kazakhs and, during the Tsarist era, was also part of the Uralsk Oblast.\n\nDuring the civil unrest, local Kazakhs, led by Jahansha Dosmukhamedov, firmly established themselves in these areas, declaring the establishment of the independent \"Uil Vilayat\" entity and claiming the right to represent the entirety of the Alash Orda. Dosmukhamedov subsequently consolidated his influence within the local populace, maintaining unwavering popularity and influence throughout this period.\n\nThis is the reason why our territories have not been fully under our jurisdiction. Despite the Ataman's covetous gaze upon these lands, they now fall under the governance of local Kazakhs who have hastened to proclaim their own \"autonomy\". Moreover, these Kazakhs are openly engaging in conflict with us, intent on seizing all the \"arbitrarily selected\" grazing lands on the left bank of the Ural River. It is imperative that we bring an end to this hostility as swiftly as possible."
url.3.a: "Now we're in charge!"

url.4.t: "Hostility Between Two Families"
url.4.d: "Ataman Tolstov has served as the uninterrupted leader of the Ural Cossacks for nearly two decades. During this period, the Ural Cossacks evolved into a bastion of conservatism, amassing substantial wealth through fishing and oil leases, but at a cost of the burgeoning fortune of their Ataman. He skillfully navigated the situation to emerge as the primary beneficiary.\n\nNaturally, this development could not fail to ignite discontent among some sections of the Cossack community. According to those in opposition, Tolstov was a figure who nearly dismantled the Ural Host during the Civil War, refusing collaboration with other anti-Bolshevik factions, effectively operating as an uncontrollable feudal warlord. Having consolidated power in his own hands and those of his extended family, the Tolstovs thrived throughout this period, as did their allies. On the other side, the influential Borodin family remained a prominent presence.\n\nMikhail Borodin, a representative of liberal views, had personally refused the position of Ataman in 1917. He advocated cooperation with both the Komuch and the People’s Army, hoping for universal democratization, and openly opposed the Ataman and turned other Cossack leaders against him.\n\nIt is now clear that Tolstov has complete control over the situation. According to Tolstov's plan, Borodin must be arrested while the opportunity exists — and there is reason to believe that this will happen. Some members of the Ataman's inner circle opposed this decision, fearing possible unrest among the Cossacks. However, the final decision rests with Tolstov."
url.4.a: "Arrest Borodin!"
url.4.b: "There is no need to stir up trouble."

url.5.t: "Confrontation With Tolstov?"
url.5.d: "Ataman Tolstov is an unscrupulous traitor to the cause of all Russia, who has amassed a personal fortune through his power — he is incapable of effectively leading his Host. He hails from a noble family in the Urals, but he is a mediocre individual who stumbled into power and was unwilling to relinquish it for anything. His true character was revealed during the Civil War when he refused to assist his allies and miraculously avoided destroying the Ural Host.\n\nFortuitously, there exists a more deserving candidate in Mikhail Borodin, a man with democratic ideals and worthiness, also from a noble family. By removing Ataman Tolstov from power, we will gain a valuable ally and confidence in his abilities. Ultimately, the Ural Cossacks will be spared from the time bomb that traitor Tolstov has planted."
url.5.a: "We need Ural Cossacks on our side."
url.5.b: "We have to recognize status-quo."

url.6.t: "Coup in Uralsk"
url.6.d: "In Uralsk today, the conflict between two powerful families reached a climax as Mikhail Borodin, backed by a contingent of Ural Cossacks and Dutov, the ataman of Orenburg Cossacks, mobilized his forces against Vladimir Tolstov, another ataman. Skirmishes erupted in the streets of Uralsk as fierce battles raged for strategic positions. Tolstov, taken by surprise and lacking adequate support, found himself in a precarious position. Within a matter of hours, Borodin's forces overcame Tolstov's supporters, and Tolstov himself was captured. In an effort to prevent further bloodshed, he agreed to resign and depart Uralsk under armed guard. Borodin, now in control, swiftly consolidated his position."
url.6.a: "Will the things change now?"

url.7.t: "Coup in Uralsk"
url.7.d: "In Uralsk today, the conflict between two powerful families reached a climax as Mikhail Borodin, backed by a contingent of Ural Cossacks and our ataman Dutov, mobilized his forces against Vladimir Tolstov, another Ataman. Skirmishes erupted in the streets of Uralsk as fierce battles raged for strategic positions. Tolstov, taken by surprise and lacking adequate support, found himself in a precarious position. Within a matter of hours, Borodin's forces overcame Tolstov's supporters, and Tolstov himself was captured. In an effort to prevent further bloodshed, he agreed to resign and depart Uralsk under armed guard. Borodin, now in control, swiftly consolidated his position."
url.7.a: "Now we must be united in our struggle."

url.8.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Recognizes Our Government"
url.8.d: "Following the personal contribution of Ataman Dutov to the triumph of our new Ataman, his government officially acknowledged Borodin, and our leaders, in a personal meeting in Orenburg, executed an act of non-belligerence, acknowledging mutual boundaries, and, most importantly, deliberated on a strategy for countering Russia's adversaries. Now, with our unity fortified, the Cossacks once again stand united in their patriotic sentiments."
url.8.a: "Glory to Borodin and Dutov!"

url.9.t: "Borodin's Flight"
url.9.d: "Our attempt to apprehend Ataman Tolstov has proven futile, but we have at least neutralized the threat he posed. When the authorities came to apprehend the traitor, he had already escaped — naturally, to Orenburg and Ataman Dutov, thus directly linking his attempted coup with this haughty warlord of Orenburg. In any case, Borodin no longer poses an obstacle to us."
url.9.a: "Now we are not afraid of the opposition."

url.10.t: "Dictatorship of Tolstov"
url.10.d: "Today we have received information that Mikhail Borodin, a Cossack and a friend of ours, as well as the leader of the opposing Cossack faction against Ataman Tolstov, has escaped from Uralsk, fearing arrest. Ataman Tolstov has been in power since 1918 and has repeatedly demonstrated his treachery towards Russia and the Cossack cause by openly refusing to assist and support the Allied forces. During the post-war period, he amassed a personal fortune through his involvement in the oil and fishing trades, thereby enhancing his influence, yet failing to extend even a momentary assistance to others. With the flight of Borodin, it appears that we have completely lost our foothold among the Ural Cossacks."
url.10.d2: "$url.10.d$ However, there is still hope. Ataman Dutov has proposed entering into negotiations with the Kazakh government on the left bank of the Ural, represented by Jahansha Dosmukhamedov, who opposes Tolstov and aims to gain full control over their grazing lands and territories in general. It is possible that in exchange for their assistance, we could establish an anti-Bolshevik alliance with them."
url.10.a: "Bastard!"
url.10.b: "We can do it without them."
url.10.c: "We need to come to an agreement with them."

url.11.t: "[FROM.GetLeader] Supports the Nomads!"
url.11.d: "We have received reliable intelligence from our sources in Orenburg indicating that the local administration under Ataman Dutov has decided to provide material support in the form of weapons and ammunition to the non-religious government of Dosmukhamedov's Kirgizs. Our leader deems this act to be a betrayal of the Cossacks on the part of Dutov in favor of a criminal element that has illegally declared its \"autonomy\". In response to this act of treachery, the leader proposes to sever all ties with Dutov and impose trade sanctions on them."
url.11.a: "It won't help these nomads!"
url.11.b: "We must demonstrate our mettle to the insolent from Orenburg!"

url.12.t: "Question of the Zemstvos"
url.12.d: "The zemstvos were elected local government bodies that gained significant popularity in the final years of the Russian Empire and represented an almost ideal model of self-governance for Russian realities at the guberniya and volost levels. These institutions provided the population with accessible education, healthcare services, postal services, and insurance coverage. However, it is worth noting that they never extended their reach to the Ural Cossack Host. The question arises: should we allow the establishment of zemstvos or not?"

url.13.d: "We have decided to enter into a negotiation with these restive Kirgizs and their emissary. After all, there are a great many nomads on our lands, and we must find some way to coexist. Their emissary, Zhakhansha Dosmukhammedov, has demanded substantial concessions, specifically the admission of nomad opposition representatives to the government on equal terms. Are we prepared to accept this deal, which seems unfair?"

url.15.t: "Perspective on the Current State of Affairs in Russia"
url.15.d: "Today, at an extraordinary congress of the Cossacks' Circle, Ataman [ROOT.GetLeader] heard a report about the lawlessness occurring in Russia. The purpose of this meeting was not only to discuss the situation but also to devise a strategy for action. Given the universal and unwavering hatred for what the Cossacks refer to as \"Bolshevism\", which they believe is the root cause of Russia's current troubles, a group of warmongers proposed declaring war on this evil entity, which they see as a threat to Russia's very existence.\n\nAt the official level, it was suggested recognizing [RVA.GetLeader]'s government as the sole legitimate authority and immediately entering into conflict. However, this proposal did not garner unanimous support. Some members of the circle argued that the Ural Host should not become embroiled in this conflict for the sake of its own people, as the war had not yet reached their territories. They proposed waiting until it did, then defending their lands as the defending party."

url.16.d: "Despite the preparations for quelling the Kirgiz insurrection, we have not been successful. In recent days, the onslaughts of the nomadic tribes have grown more severe and destructive. They seized Guryev first, taking advantage of our vulnerability, and now Uralsk has fallen as well. The local non-native population contributed to this to the best of their abilities.\n\nRegardless, our government has been forced to abandon the capital, which has disintegrated along the way, and we lack information about the whereabouts of our other allies. It appears that the entirety of our military might has fallen into the hands of the Kirgiz!"

url.20.d: "Distressing reports come from Uralsk — the local Cossack administration has been unable to confront the escalating threat posed by the majority of the populace, comprising both nomadic and sedentary Kazakhs. Within recent days, Uralsk, the last bastion of the Cossacks' power, has crumbled, leaving Kazakh civil authority in unchallenged control over the entirety of the former Cossack realm.

url.40.t: "The Swedish Cossacks"
url.40.d: "During the bloody fighting of the Great Northern War at the beginning of the 18th century, the Swedish army suffered defeat after defeat at the hands of the mighty Russian army. Despite the best efforts of Karl XII, the Swedes, who had for so long been a strong rival to their eastern neighbour, were crushed under the heel of advancing armies of Peter I, and the battles of Poltava and Perevol, among others, proved that the mighty Northern Empire was seeing its last days as the hegemon of the Baltic sea. Many Swedes, seeing this collapse, surrendered after decisive battles, with a tally of more than a hundred thousand Swedish soldiers captured by the end of the conflict.\n\n The Russian state, heavily modernizing at the time, saw an opportunity for cheap labour and utilized these prisoners to construct the numerous programs started near St. Petersburg and Moscow, but there was also a smaller subset of these prisoners who would travel much further into the cold reachers of Siberia. These men, usually coming from a background of metallurgy, helped build the factories and mills of the Ural mountains, and despite being prisoners of war, they received good treatment from their overseer, industrialist Vasily Tatishcheev, who allowed these men to retain their faith and even marry local Russian women without the need to convert.\n\n Other Swedes and also Finnish prisoners would go on to serve Russia in a military role, supporting the garrisons along the Ural mountains by keeping watch against the Kirgiz and Kazakh tribes, who occasionally entered these areas on raids. While these events occurred centuries ago, many Swedes and Finns still remain in the Ural mountains, supplemented partially by a small Swedish colony of ironworkers who arrived to this far away region to help set up valuable industry with their numerous skills in the craft. Many of these foreigners have since converted to the lifestyle, language and faith of Russians, but they still uphold some of their peculiarities, manners and customs, with even a tiny minority in the vicinity of the Vozdvizhenskaya fortress hanging on to their odd dialect. Their numbers may not be large and their society not particularly different from the Ural Russian layman, but they are just as eager to serve our new state for the betterment of this noble region!"

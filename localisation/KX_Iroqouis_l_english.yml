IQR_british_parliment_desc:0 "The style of our government has been tailored to better reflect that of the British Parliment.

Laws are now able to be proposed and enacted in a much faster time than before with this modernized form of government at our aid. All of the elected few prepare to utilize this new normal of political structure in the near future to come."

IQR_house_of_deskaheh_desc:0 "As our people enter a new age of freedom and civil liberty, we must not forget of others who still toil in their own bondage. It is with this goal at heart that our nation seeks to modernize its democratic policy. No longer can depends on our old ways of governance, ones that lead our eyes away from deprived freedoms from across the world. As the Iroquois have pulled themselves up from the dark, so to must they act to free others by modernizing their government."
IQR_IQRanaki_royalty:0 "Our Democratic Traditions"
IQR_IQRanaki_royalty_desc:0 "Long has it been since our founding leaders chose for our nation to be one that stands for peace.

IQR_british_aid:0 "Aiding British Resistance"
IQR_british_aid_desc:0 " Long has the radical Elwood Towner been a thorn in the side of our nation.

IQR_royal_army:0 "Iroquois Army"

The other serves to deliver right retaliation to those who would harm those allies or the ideals they embody."

## Parties ##

IQR_authoritarian_democrat_party:0 "Iroquoisian-British Royal Commission" 
IQR_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Iroquoisian-British Royal Commission - Formed as a merger between the ruling Grand Council of the confederacy and the British Exiles' administration, the Royal Commission has worked to further both the goals of the indigenous peoples and the Anglo refugees. Functioning as a sort of conservative-coalition party, the Royal Commission has worked to undermine the legacy and influence of Elwood Towner and the New Englanders as well as foster closer ties between the natives and the Exiles, with the rest of the Entente with them. Covertly, the Iroquois delegates and party officials also actively undermine the British and their taint at every step, taking as much good as they can from their presence while damming the flow of their ambitions, preventing the Anglos from drowning our culture and government in their murky depths. The Royal Commission walks a delicate balance between being the last redoubt against the weathering storm of new imperialism and the open gate of European influence and deception."

IQR_social_liberal_party:0 "Great Peacemaker Movement"
IQR_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Great Peacemaker Movement - Led by famed speaker Levi General, or as he is more commonly known as Deskaheh, the Great Peacemaker movement harkens back to the great Peacemaker Deganawida of antiquity: revered founder of our Confederacy who along with Hiawatha, Jigonhsasee, drafted the original Great Law of Peace. Harkening to this legacy, the Great Peacemaker Movement seeks to modernize and uplift the strong democratic traditions of the People of the Longhouse whilst simultaneously bringing them into the modern age, both independent of Towner’s oppression and European influence."

## Events ##

IQR.1.t:0 "The Legacy of Deganawida"
IQR.1.d:0 "The High Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner has granted the People of the Longhouse with autonomy! With this move, the Haudenosaunee rises again as it once did centuries ago: a united and sovereign confederacy of the Iroqiouian peoples. Though the extent of our control is limited to the region around Lake Erie, or as we call it ‘Erielhonan’, our people once again breathe free air without being suffocated by the yoke of any oppressor. Though nominally within the greater Confederation under Chief Towner, we are free to pursue our own policies, both foreign and domestic, while also allowing us to raise our own army as we once did before the fall. With this room to do as we please, our leaders have come together once again to update the original Great Law of Peace, or ‘Kaianere’kó:wa’, reaffirming and modernizing the wampum pact of the great Peacemaker Deganawida and his followers Hiawatha and Jigonhsasee. With the union restored, the Six Nations march hand in hand, ready to face any hurdle we come across."
IQR.1.a:0 "Smoke billows once again from the glowing hearth of the Great Longhouse"

IQR.2.t:0 "A Tadodaho meets a King"
IQR.2.d:0 "In the dead of night, the Grand Council, led by Tadodaho, or Chief, [IQR.GetLeader] have held a secret meeting with the King-in-exile of the British Throne. Returning briefly to these lands from his banishment, the King and his retinue were escorted after getting off a silent, engineless barge floating up the Hudson; the silent craft drawing little attention as to hide its precious cargo. With this meeting, a new deal has been proposed between the White Man and the People of the Longhouse, though this one we would ensure would not shatter our union as it did in the past. All the lower chiefs were in agreeance with the Tadodaho that this meeting was in the best interests of all the Haudenosaunee peoples, and that without outside support, we would never be free of Towner’s thumb or the Americans ire. This foreign King, long desdencent of the mad king whose deal split Oneida and Tuscarora from our union during the American Revolution, speaks with a reverence and respect not seen in his ancestors. The noble young man wishes to restore our alliance in return for asylum for himself and the rest of the Royalist Exiles. If we were to accept, these Anglos would certainly push for a more british-style government, drifting us further into their sphere of influence. Instead, we should uphold our long-standing democratic traditions and deny these White Devils, as trading one oppressor with another will likely do us no good. The choice is up to the Toadadaho and the Grand Council, with the future of the Longhouse Peoples hanging in the balance."
IQR.2.a:0 "Our democratic traditions make us superior to uncivilized savages, deny them at once"
IQR.2.b:0 "Let us respect the deals of the past and our elders, strike the deal"


IQR.3.t:0 "Anglican Church "
IQR.3.d:0 "With our recent acceptance of the King-in-exile’s secret deal with the Grand Council, we have taken in a large group of Anglo refugees into our lands. Most middle to upper class nobility and other conservative monarchist supporters, these devout subjects to their King are, unsurprisingly, also incredibly pious in their faith and the Anglican Church. To gerner their support, as well as to suppress the potential headache of their discontent in our lands, the Grand Council and Tadodaho [tag.leadername] have sanctioned the creation of a new Anglican Church of the Haundesnaunee. Drawing inspiration from the English church as well as the now-defunct Church of Hawaii of Kamehameha IV, this new center of faith shall be a beacon of a new age, both alleviating tensions with our new benefactors and illuminating the way forward to a brighter and more prosperous future. With the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Christian God, the Iroquois and Anglos shall be united in both common struggle and common faith, and together we shall retake the glories of old that have been so long denied to us!"
IQR.3.a:0 "The Truth Shall Make Us Free"

IQR.4.t:0 "The recreation of the standing army of the Haudenosaunee"
IQR.4.d:0 "With backing from our Anglo friends, we have recreated the famed iroquois army of old. Once only comprised of two thousand or so armed men, our modern armed forces tops that ten times over and more, and now with the advancements of the modern day at our fingertips, weapons of war such as artillery, planes, and motorized machines are now at our disposal; all courtesy of the British. With this influx of military equipment has also come the influence and teachings of their officer corps and general staff, adding to the experience and expertise of our armed forces and staff at the cost of furthering Anglo interference in all of our affairs. Everything has its price it would seem."
IQR.4.a:0 "Armed with rifle and tomahawk, these new Braves will bring honor to the Iroquois"

IQR.5.t:0 "An odd request from an enemy long thought extinct"
IQR.5.d:0 "The sands of time flow more unpredictably than even the sands of the great Saharra, and this has been proven yet again today with the arrival of a letter at our colonial office today. With an envelope embroidered with illustrious purple pearls of an age long passed with a wax seal embossed with the insignia an an old foe, the letter declared the Haudenosaunee to be both alive and prosperous once more, and was now petitioning for entrance into the Entente, asking us since the fall of Canada to Elwood Towner’s savage rampage across the True North has left our administration as the head seat of the alliance. Fighting against them centuries ago in conflicts like the French-Indian War and the Beaver Wars, we know well of the ferocity of the native warrior. In this odd and ironic twist of fate, old enemies rising from the ashes of old allies have come knocking at our door. A foothold on the North American continent would be a boon, opening up opportunities to save the Quebecois under Towner’s reign and restore Entente dominance in what was once Canada. We musn’t dawdle, this is an opportunity too good to ignore!’"
IQR.5.a:0 "It is simply too good an opportunity to pass up, we accept!"

IQR.6.t:0 "A possible end to the centuries of humiliation?"
IQR.6.d:0 "The Six Nations once stood as one of the greatest ingiegnous groups of the New World, laying claim to thousands of square-miles of territory across the Great Lakes region. We were once leaders, both respected and feared by our neighbors as they paled in comparison to our Confederacy’s unity and strength. The great people of the Oneida, Onondaga, Mohawk, Cayuga, Seneca, and, later, the Tuscarora once commanded and controlled the destiny of our region. This power waned in the face of the White Man’s growth, with their greed and guile nearly destroying our great union on more than one occasion. Under their spell the noble Haudenosaunee of old were turned against one another, as brother fought brother as the Europeans and Americans squabbled over their ambitions. In the wake these failures and loss of Red blood in wars like the American Revolution or the Beaver Wars, our people were broken and disgraced, and soon after we were forced into reservations, living in squalor and dishonor until Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner and his native militants toppled both the regimes of Canada and New England. With his conquest, our people were made free once again. As we have rebuilt and modernized, we have sought desperately to remove the black mark of our past defeats and divisions. Though we have brought independence and prosperity back to our people, a unique opportunity has revealed itself. With Entente backing and our newfound strength, we could ride south into the war torn lands of the Americans and retake what was once taken from us. Our ancestral lands lie within our reach as the chaos and destruction caused by the 2nd American Civil War has left our old foe vulnerable. Though it would be a risky war, and many lives of young Iroqoius warriors would be lost, many in our council believe these deaths to be worth the long term benefits of an expansion into and reconquest of our ancestral lands. It is up to Chief [IQR.GetLeader] to decide what is the best path forward for the People of the Longhouse."
IQR.6.a:0 "War drums are heard across the Six Nations as the Haudenosaunee thirst for vengeance"
IQR.6.b:0 "We will not waste valuable Red blood on the trail of revenge"

POLITICS_DESKAHEH_DESC:0 "The great Deskaheh, noble Cayuga-Oneida statesman and Chief of the Haudenosaunee, has spent his life in service to his people. Born in Tuscarora Township in 1873, he would go by the English name of Levi General for much of his life, championing the cause of his people’s independence against the Canadian and American governments for decades. Falling in with Elwood Towner during his raids against the White Devil, General returned home to his people a proud and victorious warrior, earning the People of the Longhouse their autonomy with he and his warriors service to the high Chief ‘Red Cloud’ Towner. Now leading the newly independent Iroquois Confederacy, Deskaheh looks to the future to carve a new path into the future for the Haundesnosaunne people, free from all outside taint. "
POLITICS_STACY_IROQUOIS_DESC:0 "A proud Mohawk and warrior from a young age, John Stacey is a born leader. Born in 1888 on Kahnawà:ke Mohawk reserve in what was once Quebec, Stacey fought valiantly in the Weltkrieg for the Canadian Army, serving in 114th Battalion from 1916 until the end of the war, narrowly dying twice after surviving both a gunshot to the face and chest, as well as an airplane accident in 1918. Returning home, Stacey expected a hero’s welcome but instead was met with unemployment and poverty as the Entente’s loss was felt across the True North. Traveling around Canada and the American Northeast throughout the interwar looking for work, Stacey would find comradery and joy in his fellow vetereran’s company and their newly exiled companions, with their Anglo customs and ideas further rubbing off on him. Seeking purpose, he joined in with Elwood Towner’s crusade against the White Man as the 2nd American Civil War raged, returning home a war hero once again; this time in a war his side had won. Proving himself a true warchief in two wars, Stacey was elevated to the position of Chief upon the creation of our newly autonomous state, and under his rule, along with our British allies’ help, the Haundesaunnee march forward towards their future."

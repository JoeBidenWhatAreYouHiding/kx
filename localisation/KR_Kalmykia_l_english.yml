KLY_Focus_Defence:0 "Focus on Defense"
KLY_Focus_Defence_desc:0 "We should focus on defense more in these times of growing chaos and battlelust.

### Events ###
kly.1.t:0 "Kalmykia Reborn"
kly.1.d:0 "During the chaos in the Don Republic, that has been brought by the Berlin Stock Crisis and the horrors of Black Monday, we could finally achieve our independence. While our new nation is still in a state of chaos, the Kalmyk Military Government under the guidance of Nomto Ochirov and Danzan Tundutov has declared its supreme rule over Elista. However, there are already several smaller political groups that want to seize power for themselves. The Kalmyk Socialists, led by Anton Amur-Sanan, a former Bolshevik, seeks to establish a worker’s paradise while the leader of the Astrakhan Cossacks, Count Danzan Tundutov, seeks to revive the Khanate of old. Alternatively, the Kalmyk Buddhists led by Luvsan-Sharap Tepkin, Lama of the Kalmyk people, seek to drift towards Ungern in Mongolia and create a truly free Bhuddhist theocracy here in the heart of the Volga. The future of the Kalmyks are uncertain as they stand at the crossroads of their future."

kly.2.t:0 "Independence!"
kly.2.d:0 "The power vacuum, formed after our declaration of independence from the dying Don-Kuban union, seems to be finally resolved. Early this week the socialists started an uprising at the port of Astrakhan, with their leader Amur-Sanan having quickly managed to lead the protests and demand the immediate 'Bolshevization' of the Kalmyk Government. On the other hand, Danzan Tundutov, his cossack hordes and his Bhuddhist supporters have secured the administrative and bureaucratic buildings, where the Council is located, working feverishly to save Kalmykia from Socialist disaster. The situation is ready to flare up, as numerous civilians have reported first clashes between socialist protesters and cossacks."

kly.4.a:0 "Long live the Khan!"

kly.25.t:0 "Kalmykia Wants To Join Our Alliance"
kly.25.d:0 "An interesting proposal has landed on the desk of our administration today. The government of Kalmykia, a recently established Bhuddist cossack state in the Kuban region desires to join our alliance. Though small, their people are fanatical and fierce about their religion and autonomy, and have a storied history as the last of the western Mongols. How should we answer?"
kly.25.a:0 "Only if they become an autonomous region under our supervision."
kly.25.b:0 "A vital ally against Russian aggression, we accept!."
kly.25.c:0 "No, we shall not waste our breath on these Oirat exiles."

kly.26.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Wants Us To Become An Autonomy."
kly.26.d:0 "The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] agreed to let us into their faction as its newest member-state, but if and only if we agree to become an autonomous region in their federal structure. Though this would strip away much of our sovereignty and all of our freedom in choice of foreign policy, it may be the only way the Kalmyk people are guaranteed their safety."
kly.26.a:0 "At least they will protect us."
kly.26.b:0 "We won't give up our independence."

kly.27.t:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused!"
kly.27.d:0 "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] rejected our offer and won't ally with us. They have refused to trade in their sovereignty and freedom of foreign policy in exchange for our generous protection. It is their loss, not ours."
kly.27.a:0 "Too bad. We shall leave them for the wolves." 

kly.28.t:0 "Dambijanstan the Lost Son and Warrior Tulku Returns Home"

Born in Baga Dörbel ulus in Astrakhan, he is a native Kalmykian, and has tried to slip by untected and under the radar, attempting to return to his old life as a beggar, a bandit, or a supposed prophet. What should we do with this supposed reincarnation of Amursana, heir of the Oirat Khanate and Buddhist warrior tulku?"
kly.28.a:0 "Execute this dangerous deranged bandit and false prophet."
kly.28.b:0 "Let him live in peace so long as he lives by our laws and ways."
kly.28.c:0 "Offer him a place at one of the monasteries and a place within government."

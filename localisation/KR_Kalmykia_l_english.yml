KLY_Cossack_Tactics_desc: "The cossack tactics are optimal for us - many of our officers know them already, being cossacks themselves, and it will be far easier for them and cheaper for us to use old strategies.

### Events ###
kly.1.t: "Demarche of the Kalmyks"
kly.1.d: "During the chaos in the Don region, caused by the overthrow of the legitimately elected leader, Ataman Krasnov, a Military Circle of the Astrakhan Cossack Host, led by Danzan Tundutov, announced their disobedience towards the new regime. Simultaneously, Nomto Ochirov, Chairman of the Kalmyk Host Government, joined the protests as a representative of the civil authority of Kalmykia. As a result, a Cossack-Kalmyk Congress was held in Elista, during which it was decided to declare autonomy for the Kalmyk State, although in reality, it was more about independence secured by Tundutov's Cossacks.\n\nA dual government was immediately established, with both civilian and military administrations, and it appears that Tundutov intends to disband the Ochirov's administration, declaring his full authority. It remains unclear how this division will resolve."
kly.1.a: "We will move to secure our independence!"

kly.2.t: "Confrontation Escalates"
kly.2.d: "The power vacuum that emerged following our declaration of independence from the moribund Don Republic appears to have been finally bridged. Earlier this week, Danzan Tundutov and his Cossacks occupied administrative and bureaucratic structures in Elista, prompting protests from the democratic-minded public. Nomto Ochirov exhorted the Cossacks to surrender their weapons and submit to the civil authorities, an appeal that was echoed by the sole Kalmyk party, Khalm Tagchin Tug. With numerous civilians reporting initial clashes between protesters and Cossacks, the situation appears poised to escalate."
kly.2.a: "Tundutov backs down and withdraws the Cossacks."
kly.2.b: "Tundutov overthrows Ochirov's government."

kly.3.t: "First Kalmyk Elections"
kly.3.d: "As the first political crisis has been solved and passed by, the first Kalmyk elections are to be finally held. There are four main candidates in the running: Anton Amur-Sanan, a socialist-minded writer, Badma Ulanov, leader of the liberal wing of the 'Khalm Tangchin Tug' party; Sandzhi Bayanov, leader of the Kalmyk regional department of the Russian PSR party; Erendzhen Khara-Davan, leader of the conservative wing of the 'Khalm Tangchin Tug' party and Lubsan Sharab Tepkin, leader of the Narna Gerl Buddhist organisation.

Though small, their people are fanatical and fierce about their religion and autonomy, and have a storied history as the last of the western Mongols. How should we answer?"
kly.25.a: "Only if they become an autonomous region under our supervision."
kly.25.b: "A vital ally against Russian aggression, we accept!."
kly.25.c: "No, we shall not waste our breath on these Oirat exiles."

kly.26.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Wants Us To Become An Autonomy."
kly.26.d: "The government of [FROM.GetNameDefCap] agreed to let us into their faction as its newest member-state, but if and only if we agree to become an autonomous region in their federal structure. Though this would strip away much of our sovereignty and all of our freedom in choice of foreign policy, it may be the only way the Kalmyk people are guaranteed their safety."
kly.26.a: "At least they will protect us."
kly.26.b: "We won't give up our independence."

kly.27.t: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] Refused!"
kly.27.d: "[FROM.GetNameDefCap] rejected our offer and won't ally with us. They have refused to trade in their sovereignty and freedom of foreign policy in exchange for our generous protection. It is their loss, not ours."

kly.28.t: "Dambijanstan the Lost Son and Warrior Tulku Returns Home"

What should we do with this supposed reincarnation of Amursana, heir of the Oirat Khanate and Buddhist warrior tulku?"
kly.28.a: "Execute this dangerous deranged bandit and false prophet."
kly.28.b: "Let him live in peace so long as he lives by our laws and ways."

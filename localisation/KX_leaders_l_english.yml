POLITICS_HERMAN_BLOUTE_DESC:0 "Musical pioneer and funkadelic mixmaster, Herman Poole Blount has risen from humble beginnings as a musician and artist to become the very face of the Afro-Revivalist movement. The herald of Afrofuturism, the guide of our African-inspired renaissance, and the architect of our new cosmic future was born on May 22, 1914, in Birmingham, Alabama, and this ‘Sun Ra’ - as he likes to be called - has since become the facade of a radical coalition of varied Black nationalists seeking to control the destiny and identity of our republic. Blount, or ‘Sonny’ as his mother and sister used to call him, was born a musical prodigy, becoming a skilled pianist as a toddler and learning to compose and sight-read music before becoming a teenager, but most of his life’s details are kept intentionally-obscure by the man himself. First getting his start in professional music after joining his high school biology teacher’s band, Sun Ra would take off as a harmonious genius, briefly entering college before dropping out after his mysterious ‘Trip to Saturn.’ \n\nIn this ‘Trip,’ Blount claimed to have spiritually traveled to the distant planet of Saturn where he communed with strange beings that told him to drop out of college in order to use his musical talent and philosophy to bring peace to Earth, for a great disaster was on the horizon. It would not be long before the young Blount was proven right, for just a few months later, the Second American Civil War would begin, throwing the entire nation into chaos. \nAs the conflict exploded into bloodshed and the later BBR rose, Blount found himself drifting closer and closer to the radical end of New-Afrikan politics, and would find allies within the ABB, NOI, UNIA, and the Unity League. With the rise of the ‘Americanist’ forces in the nation and their crackdown on Afro-nationalism, Blount was uplifted to be the face of a new radical coalition of his varied friendly parties, all with one goal in common - to bring about a new African renaissance by toppling the Americanist regime. Utilized due to his immense popularity and due to his stance as the key figure of the Afro-revivalist movement, Blount is mostly a puppet to the powers behind him - a cultural pharaoh without a throne, but that may soon change..."
POLITICS_SUN_RA_DESC:0 "Solidifying the cult of personality around himself as well as the foundations of our new Afro-Cosmic identity, the man once called Herman Poole Blount is no more. Now, Le Sony’r Ra has begun to rise past the power and control of his political allies, and has revealed to the wider public of his ‘Trip to Saturn.’ Professing to the people that he is their savior from another world, Ra seeks to use his solidified alliances and political partners to bring about a new cultural revolution for his people. Fusing ideas and policies from across the political, artistic, and philosophical spectrums, Ra will bring a new cosmic golden age to this New Afrika, and though many in the nation still doubt his otherworldly origins, they have begun to believe he truly has the best interests for all mankind at heart. With newfound power and with his handlers waning in influence, Sun Ra has slowly begun to truly rule the nation himself, and by preaching peace and cooperation between our people above any petty struggle or ambition, he moves more and more of the masses to follow in his wake as he guides the nation to its new syncretic, celestial, Afro-centric future."
POLITICS_SUN_RA_GIGA_DESC:0 "Severing the puppet strings that once bound his mortal form, Cosmic Pharaoh Le Sony’r Ra - or just Sun Ra as the devoted masses praise him as - now lords over the Cosmic Realm of Aaru as its sole shepherd and all-powerful savior. Ra has shed the need for political allies as the masses praise their new divine leader’s name, supporting his mandate to rule with feverish adulation. This new saturnine field of reeds shall be the promised land of our reborn celestial race. This peace-preaching alien from Saturn has ensnared the hearts and minds of our people with his music, his poetry, his vision, and now the Aaruites prosper under this otherworldly deity. Bonded together by a new identity and culture that pulls from our Egyptian and West African roots, our origins from beyond the heavens, and our Afrofuturist destiny, the African diaspora shall be united and brought to our promised land out among the stars. We are the children of Saturn, the heirs to the Pharaohs, the heralds of the new African future, and the star children of destiny - all thanks to the all beloved and all eternal Sun Ra!"
POLITICS_WENTFORD_MATTHEW_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, Wentworth Aruthur Matthew claims to hail from Lagos, Nigeria. However, records indicate that he was in-fact born in the West Indies on the Island of St. Kitts - a fact he hides from most to uphold his greater ‘African’ image. As a young man, he and later his family moved to New York City where he eventually became a naturalized US citizen along with his wife Florence. Influenced by the teachings of Marcus Garvey and by the faith of New York City’s massive White Jewish population, Matthew would found the Commandment Keepers in 1919 in his new home of Harlem, starting his journey to bring honor and prosperity to the Black Hebrew Israelites. Thanking the White ‘Khazar’ Jews for safeguarding the faith for centuries, Rabbi Matthew claims that though Black Jews are the true Jews, that other Jews also deserve respect and protection to reward them for their unwavering piety. Attracted to ideas about the Lost Tribes, King Solomon, and the Beta Israelites of Ethiopia, Rabbi Matthew has combined Jewish faith with Africa and Ethiopian influences, claiming that the Black Hebrews are heirs to the Solomonic Dynasty of Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, and to the original Kingdom of Israel. Though other groups far more radical than the Commandment Keepers have tied themselves to Matthew’s movement, he himself is a moderate, and seeks to work together with our fellow Jews regardless of race or history. Together, we shall build a new Land of Milk and Honey."

Under the command of Wentworth and with Frank Cherry whispering in his ear, the Black Hebrew Israelites shall finally have their revenge on the Khazar bastards and this sinful, decadent Western 'Civilization.’"

POLITICS_BOB_BARTLETT_DESC:0"Bob Bartlett was a University of Alaska graduate turned News Reporter until 1933, where he became the secretary of Alaskan politician Anthony Dimond. In 1934 and upwards, Bartlett served as a secretary and running-mate to Ernest Greuning. Together, both men focussed their political efforts on improving the state of Alaska’s people. Bartlett is characterized by his morals and constant servitude to Alaska, a land which he has no intention to let fall into the hands of anything but a strong, people-powered government"
POLITICS_BIRCH_DESC:0"Stephen Birch presided over Kennecott Copper, the Alaska based, largest copper production company in America. The Alaskan Syndicate member resigned as President of Kennecott in 1933, although he kept control of other mineral and transportation companies centered in Alaska. When Alaska declared independence from America, Birch and the rest of the Syndicate immediately jumped on ship with the Last Frontier, seeing their opportunity to control the frozen peaks and land. Reinstating himself as Kennecott Copper President, Birch remains on top of one of the richest and most powerful corporations in the world"
POLITICS_GUGGENHEIM_DESC:0"Simon Guggenheim of the Jewish descended Guggenheim Family is a rich Capitalist with with significant control over Alaska’s copper, salmon, and transportation industries. His Alaskan Syndicate, made to monopolize Alaskan resources and gain political power over its people, rivals Alaska’s own Legislation on terms of political pull. Upon Alaska’s break from America in 1937, Simon Guggenheim travelled to the frozen land to secure complete power over it in its unstable governmental state. Guggenheim’s plans are big, but so is the work needed to put them into action"
POLITICS_JAMES_WICKERSHAM_DESC:0"James Wickersham served as Alaskan District Judge in the years 1900 - 1908, where he ran for a spot as territorial representative to the US House of Reps, a position he held until 1933. Although technically a Republican, his personal war with the Alaskan Syndicate’s cruelly capitalistic business methods caused him to seek heavy Federal assistance for Alaska. Ultimately at the end of his terms, his pushes against the Syndicate were not assisted by the rest of the Legislation, and the situation had only gotten worse in time. Angered by the Legislations refusal to crack down on the Barons, Wickersham wants for Alaska a land where the people’s work cannot be tarnished by greedy businessmen and capitalists, but his left leaning supporters yearn for a more red set of ideals"

The wealthy man owns a mining development company and numerous movie theaters, as well as a newspaper company. Opposing federal control of businesses, but fearful of Syndicate buying out, Lathrop heads the Alaska Corporate Party as a means of assisting his and other smaller scale business owners’ interests"
POLITICS_DIMOND_DESC:0"Anthony Dimond of New York came to Alaska in 1905 as a prospector. In his major Political years, he served as a US Commissioner, an Assistant Attorney, a Mayor, and a Senator, all based in Alaska. Dimond’s heavy portfolio shows him as a clear, intelligent man whose feats are only contested by his brutal anti-semetism. This trait has caused him to be at odds with the Jewish-descended Guggenheim’s, and Dimond holds a certain disdain for large and wealthy groups who attempt to lead average people"
POLITICS_SUTHERLAND_DESC:0"An Alaskan Representative to the US House of Reps from 1921 to 1931, “Fighting Dan’s” dog sled campaigning and aircraft rescuing career seemed to end after he moved to Pennsylvania. In 1937, the politician turned purchasing agent fled back to Alaska with the outbreak of the Second American Civil War, welcomed with open arms by fellow Republicans as the man who could fight to keep a conservative majority as the Last Frontier’s political climate went below zero"
POLITICS_ERNEST_GRUENING_DESC:0"Ernest Greuning, Harvard Graduate who served briefly in the Weltkrieg in field artillery, came to Alaska in 1934 as Director of the Division of Territories and Island Possessions under Herbert Hoover. Alaska’s desperate economical situation alongside America’s growing political tensions caused Greuning to stay in the Last Frontier. Upon the outbreak of the 2ACW in 1937, Greuning took the title of Alaskan President in place of Governor John Weir Troy with the goal of helping Alaska not only survive, but thrive in their intense physical and political climate"
POLITICS_LOVESTONE_DESC:0 "Jay Lovestone was born as Jacob Liebstein in Belarus. His father moved to America, and became attached to Socialist ideas, eventually joining the fledgeling American Communist Party. As Communism became overshadowed by Syndicalism, Lovestone refused to adapt, keeping true to his Communist ideas even has Communism collapsed. This gained him many enemies within the new Socialist Party of America, who he refused to support. As America broke out into Civil War, Lovestone begrudgingly supported the Combined Syndicates, however, was exiled once it was found out that he was feeding information about the government to MacArthur. With nowhere else to flee; Lovestone took a ship to the last place that would take him in, Alaska.  Now in Alaska, Lovestone has rallied other exiled to his side, and helped for the new neo-socialist ideas that were made famous in Alaska. Now in charge of Alaska, Lovestone will set out to reform the Last Frontier with new socialistic ideals. "
POLITICS_TOWNER_DESC:0 "Born in the late 1890's on the Siletz Reservation in Oregon, Elwood Towner has lived quite the interesting life. Stolen away from his people by the White Man and forced to attend the Chemawa Indian School, Towner developed a hate for his oppressors early on. Later serving in the United States Marine Corp and seeing action in Mexico and other minor American theatres of war, Towner came home a changed man. He would attend law school, focusing his study on native advocacy and would only take indigenous clients, eventually suing the boarding school that stole him from his people and forcing its closure. With this, Towner tasted victory over the White Man and he liked its flavor. He would further radicalize, being inspired by other ethnically-focused thinkers in Japan and the American South, and began forming his own ideas on how the Red Man should live moving forward. Now, with the rapid destabilization of the United States and the looming threat of civil war, Towner has seen all he needs to see to understand who the White Man truly is: savages, dogs, mongrels, or worse.  With these facts clear, Towner has marched to Alaska to set his plan in motion. Under Towner, the Red Man's days under the White boot are numbered."

Rosenbaum became a mildly successful political writer before fleeing her native Russia after the turmoil of 1936. Traveling east to the land of opportunity, Rosenbaum renewed her career with Anthem until the Civil War brought it to a screeching halt.

Having now secured Alaska, only time will tell how successful her Objectivist experiment will fare..."

POLITICS_BOB_MINOR_DESC:0 "Bob Minor, known as 'Fighting Bob' was an old socialist cartoonist. Though his family once rubbed shoulders with Texan high society, they had lost their silver spoon by the time of Minor’s birth. Living in San Antonio, he only received education from age 10-14 before seeking work to support his family. While working in a series of jobs, Bob began to develop his artistic skills in his spare time with what spare time he had, and eventually became a renowned political cartoonist. It was through these cartoons that he expressed his developing radical views, especially his fondness for revolutionary industrial unionism. His life would be forever changed in 1907, when Minor joined the Socialist Party of America. Given the weakness of the party in the state of Texas, Minor did not take part in the sort of major riots or strikes that occurred in the Red Belt. Instead, Minor went abroad, covering the Mexican Revolution and making a trip to Paris where he fraternized with revolutionary intellectuals, further radicalizing his views. Upon returning home, he was horrified by the persecutions of leftists by the Wilson and Palmer administrations, and from then on dedicated his life's work to preserving grassroots socialism in Texas, and appealing to the revolutionary states for aid to the SPA. When the Civil War erupted, Minor, instead of taking refuge in Chicago, elected to remain in his native home of Texas, regardless of the danger. His refusal to leave spread his fame around the state, and Minor was soon helping to found the Socialist Party of Texas, in determined to bring the revolution to the state. Now in power, only the future will tell if he can complete the transformation of Texas into a red paradise."
POLITICS_MARTIN_DIES_DESC:0 "While Martin Dies Jr. is a politician, those who look at him as just another bureaucrat in a suit would be mistaken. Originally just another Texan Democrat in the House of Representatives, Dies rose in prominence for his passionate opposition to syndicalism. By the time of the 1936 election, he was Chairman of the House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities and a key ally of John Nance Garner. Once Texas declared its intent to break away from the union, Dies returned to his home state, taking with him his authoritarian tendencies. Hungry for power in the young Texan nation, Dies turned away from Garner to Huey Long and the America First Party. After gaining the favor of New Orleans, Dies became the head of the Texan branch of the America First Party, and now serves as Governor following Texas’ decision to bow to the Union State. Dies is quickly emerging as an important figure within the right wing of the America First Party and is even reputed to privately support the Christian Party. Meanwhile, he suppresses opposition to his authority, and is carefully working to shape Texas in his image as much as Long will allow."
POLITICS_EAKER_DESC:0 "Ira C. Eaker began as a bright young man from a little town in Texas. Despite earning a Bachelor’s Degree in journalism, he found that the Army was his calling. In October 1918, he became a pilot and would subsequently serve in the Philippines until 1922. Upon returning to the states as a Captain, he commanded the 5th Aero Squadron and later was post adjutant. Captain Eaker next entered the bureaucracy, eventually being named Executive Officer of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of War. His career skyrocketed after piloting a Loening float plane in a 22,000 mile trip around South America, earning the Mackay Trophy. Before long he earned himself the Distinguished Flying Cross for setting a world flight endurance record after piloting the Question Mark for seven days straight. s. In 1930, he made the first transcontinental flight entirely with instruments. In the summer of 1935, he was detached for duty with the Navy and participated aboard the aircraft carrier USS Lexington, on maneuvers in Hawaii and Guam. His experiences in the autocratic Territory of Hawaii helped to shape his views, and gave him a new affinity for authoritarian rule’s ability to maintain order and efficiency. Promoted to Brigadier General by the President during the Bleeding Texas incident in the hopes of securing his loyalty, Eaker nonetheless sided with his home state when it seceded from the Union. Upon his arrival, he was promoted once more to a General, responsible for the command of the Texan Air Corps. While Eaker initially supported the dictatorship of Texaco, he became disillusioned by Rieber’s fondness for the Constitutional American Republic and willingness to involve Texas in the affairs of the Civil War. Following Eaker’s key role in the coup deposing Texaco, he has secured himself as the dictator of the young nation. Eaker is determined to keep the plane of Texas flying high and steady, and he is more than happy to stamp out any and all who threaten to crash his beloved home."
POLITICS_NIMITZ_DESC:0 "Admiral Nimitz has become Texas' new Commander-in-chief. He is a navy man, a man who commanded a fleet in Pearl Harbor, where he gained significant experience in his craft and was able to impress his superiors. Despite his extensive travel, he is a native Texan, and recently, he has fled to his home state following the collapse of the Federal Government. He has served Texas as best he could since that time and protected the Gulf of Mexico from enemy incursion. Now that he is in charge, he plans to keep the state safe from invasions from the land or sea, and to do this, he hopes to build up the military so it will be a match for any who dare to attack Texas. First and foremost though, he is a supporter of the Navy, and will make sure it is funded and bolstered enough that it will make Texas a force to be reckoned with on the waves."
POLITICS_CACTUS_JACK_DESC:0 "John Nance Garner IV, known by his peers as 'Cactus Jack', is a lawyer and long-serving Representative from Texas. Now, he is the new President of Texas. He is a man of the Democratic establishment, a mildly conservative politician, and, most importantly, fiercely loyal to his home state: Texas. He abandoned the U.S. when he saw them sell out his beloved homestate, and fled to be with his family and his home.

POLITICS_FRANK_HAMER_DESC:0 "Rough, tough, and used to hardships, Frank Hamer might be the greatest lawman of the century. Beginning as a humble ranch wrangler, Hamer became a rising star in the Texas Rangers for his intelligence, competence, marksmanship, and loyalty. Hamer has battled bootleggers, bounty hunters, and Klansmen over the years, and conquered every single one. Notoriously skeptical of politicians, even quitting when Ma Ferguson was elected Governor, Hamer was recalled around the time of the 1936 election to combat rowdy strikers and lynchers, to great success. Credited for saving numerous lives during the leadup to the election and subsequent Bleeding Texas incident, Hamer was hailed for keeping law and order in the state, and when his pro-independence views came to light, his popularity soared further as Texas’ great protector from the corrupting influences of the rest of America. In the infant years of the young Republic, his success only continued to climb, culminating in his successful Presidential run, defined by promises of securing the peace of Texas and a fresh start from the elitist politicians only bringing Texas down. President Hamer means business, and he isn’t afraid to step on the toes of others to protect his beloved Republic."
POLITICS_COUNCIL_DESC:0 "The National Committee of State. A boring name given to such an...interesting group. Regardless, it is also known as the "Shotgun Regency", a committee of the most influential men in Texas. This is not a council designed to benefit the people; it is designed to benefit Texaco. The council is not here to stay, it is not something permanent. Rather, it is just something to provide the facade of a democratic presence while the corporations take over the country. In reality, the Oil Barons couldn't care less about Democracy, and while their plans are unknown, what is certain is that the profits of Texaco and others will never be higher."
POLITICS_TORKLID_RIEBER_DESC:0 "Nobody expected Torkild Rieber to end up in the plains of Texas. He was after all born in Norway, thousands of miles away from our shores. However, through his career making a living as a sailor, Rieber found himself in Texas. He eventually found himself managing a Texaco cargo ship, and eventually, his competence would see him rise to lead the entire company. Upon gaining Texaco's highest position, Rieber’s underlying motives began to reveal themselves. An outspoken admirer of radical right-wing leaders such as Codreanu, Reiber was a prominent donor to William H. Murray's presidential bid, and is alleged to have funded Latin American dictators as well. While the United States became embroiled into civil war, Reiber was moving behind the scenes and playing what strings he could to secure control over the young Texan nation, while working to aid the cause of the Constitutional American Republic. Now that he is firmly in control of Texas, little stands in the way of the oilman’s crusade against syndicalism, and threats to his monopoly. Rieber is Texaco, and Texaco is Texas."
POLITICS_WOODIE_GURTHIE_DESC:0 "Born to a conservative, middle class family in Oklahoma and named for Woodrow Wilson, a figure he now despises, Woody Guthrie has had an eventful life shaping him into the beloved revolutionary leader of Texas. His father was a Klansman, his mother was ravaged by Huntington’s Disease that drove her insane, his sister accidentally burned herself to death, and Woody was begging for meals and depending on friends for shelter. Though bright, he dropped out of high school to become a street performer. Guthrie was blessed with a natural talent for music, and became an instant smash hit in Texas, which became his adopted home state. But Guthrie aspired to be more than just a folk singer; he was to be a crusader against the injustice of the greedy America of old. His songs, especially “This Land is Your Land”, have launched him to become one of the loudest voices for socialism in the United States. Guthrie was torn by the Texas Independence movement, but ultimately decided to side with the young Texan nation when it seceded from the Union, in the hopes of being able to help shape it into a truly fair and free frontier. His populist calls for “cowboy socialism” and “frontier revolution” struck a chord with the young people of Texas, who, already loving him for his music, came to love him that much more for his working class charm and youthful spirit. Before he knew it, the young revolutionaries of Texas had carried the Red Cowboy into the highest office in the frontier at age 25. Now, young Woody fills the massive boots of leading Texas into the future, but he vows that his Texas will be for you and me."
POLITICS_LBJ_DESC:0 "In 1937, Lyndon Baines Johnson successfully campaigned in a special election for Texas's 10th congressional district, that covered Austin and the surrounding hill country. Running as a populist Democrat, and co-operating with Huey Long and Richard Russell, he served in the House until Texas seceded from the Union. In the young Texan state, former supporters of Long or progressive Democrats came to rally around Johnson, with his charisma and charm making him a crucial advocate for social democracy in the young state. Now that he is at the helm of the Texan nation, Johnson will do his best to build a populist ang egalitarian society, and is not above making deals with the devil to achieve this."
POLITICS_JAMES_ALLRED_DESC:0 "James V Allred has had a long and fascinating career in Texas. Initially aligned with the Democratic Party's establishment, the breaking up of the Democrats into divergent factions, and the rise of Huey long, drove him further to the left, and Allred carved out a status as a progressive Democrat, a rare sight in a South dominated by the ODP. When Texas was plunged into chaos, Allred grew weary of America's failings and inadequecies, causing him to grow increasingly sympathetic to the nascent movement for Texan independence, to which he eventually hitched his wagon. He eventually gained the traction to hold a referendum, one that overwhelmingly passed. With Washington having failed in its duty to protect the Texan people, Allred finally abandoned the Democratic Party, and led Texas's secession at the head of the new Texan Independence Party. However, many are discontented with Allred's rule, and his days at the top may be numbered."
POLITICS_WL_ODANIEL_DESC:0 "Wilbert Lee "Pappy" O'Daniel, described by some as the “most Texan man alive”, is not one by birth. It was, in fact, only his work with the Burrus Mill Flour Company that brought him to the state, and that made him a household name. Responsible for the Company’s radio advertising, O’Daniel hired multiple musicians to help him market the business. What resulted was the smashing hit Light Crust Doughboys band behind such classics as Beautiful Texas. Before long he had his own radio show that captivated Texan listeners with his Christian and political messages. Within a divided America, O’Daniel became beloved as a charismatic symbol of wholesome Texan values. This motivated O’Daniel’s entry into politics, where he flirted with the America First Party until the rise of the Texan Independence movement, where he broke with Long and backed his rival, Governor Allred for leaving the Union. With Texas free, O’Daniel used his charisma, radio, and fame to defeat Allred in the bid for the Presidency. Now that O’Daniel calls the shots, he seeks to transform Texas into a haven of prosperity, hospitality, and Christian values, free from the horrors of civil war or division."

POLITICS_AHMAD_SHAH_QAJAR_DESC:0 "Installed as Shah of Iran at the age of eleven, it could be argued that Ahmad Shah was always at the whim of the Majilis, only a figurehead in a nation still struggling with the aftermath of the events of the 1920's and beforehand. Though he would attempt to repair and unite the nation, his efforts would almost always collapse. Though the most turbulent part of his reign is arguably at an end, that does not mean there are not those wishing to see the Shah removed - whether it be Democrats who wish to establish a republic, Royalists who want install a new monarch that can surpass Ahmad Shah's abilities, or even Socialists who want to bring about a socialist revolution akin to the one declared in 1920. It seems, with all these enemies against the Shah, and his health in steady decline, that it is only a matter of time before chaos erupts across the nation."
POLITICS_HASSAN_MIRZA_QAJAR_DESC:0 "As the Crown-Prince of Iran, Hassan Mirza lived in his older brother’s shadow ever since he was installed as Shah, and had little influence in the politics of Iran during the early years of Ahmad Shah’s rule. From a young age, he would be exposed to the countless conflicts and civil uprisings that plagued the nation, from the Jangali Uprising to foreign intervention from the British and Russia, all the while his brother would seemingly do little to stop it all.  Over many years however, he would slowly build up the political, military, and diplomatic connections he desired, and attained the respect that was fit for the brother and heir of the Shah. Now, with his ascension to the Sun Throne, he has reached the very top of the Iranian political world, and it is certain he will not squander the opportunity to bring Iran into the modern age as a force to be reckoned with."
POLITICS_SAYYED_HASAN_TAQIZADEH_DESC:0 "Taqizadeh, despite being known as one of the biggest and most influential advocates for modernisation and constitutionalism, came from a family of clergymen who were descendants of the Prophet Muhammad, and it had seemed that he would follow in the footsteps of his family. However, his interest and experience with Western democracy and modern enlightenment caused him to follow a new career into politics, where he soon became a strong advocate against the Qajars and for sweeping reforms to the nation in order for it to flourish in the 20th century. With the revolution that has swept the nation, and the deposition of the Qajars, Taqizadeh has formed a new government that will seek to recreate Iran as a nation of true democracy and prosperity."
POLITICS_IRAJ_ESKANDARI_DESC:0 "As a Qajar Prince, Eskandari was given an education in France where he was exposed to the young syndicalist nation and its socialist teachings, to which he had soon begun to admire. He would link up with other Iranian socialists in the country, and even some of the key figures of the Edalat Party who had been forced to flee after Ahmad Shah's attempted assassination, and the subsequent crackdown of socialism. Though he was unable to return home, he would slowly become one of the more popular figures of socialism in Iran, especially as the movement would begin to see greater popularity amongst the workers and peasants of Iran. With the Edalat Party now in power, Eskandari has been appointed as President of the new Socialist Republic, promising greater freedoms for peasants and unions, and the redistribution of wealth to the common people."
POLITICS_JAMES_BURNHAM_DESC:0 "A fellow-travelor of the far-left ever since he's been politically active, James Burnham began as a starry-eyed supporter of the Russian Revolution before seeing it quashed. His hope in socialism was revitalized with the British and French Revolutions only to witness the Empires of old not only persist but reform themselves internally. Influenced by French Sorelianism and his personal readings of Machiavelli he has come to view politics as largely a power struggle between competing elites with revolutions only temporarily succeeding in nations that failed to modernize their elite into a "Managerialist" class of technocratic minds as opposed to the aristocrats and capitalists of old. Viewing imperialist expansion as an inevitable consequence of their growing bureaucracies and promotion of national myths Burnham is dismayed by what he views as the infighting and factionalism promoted by traditional syndicalism and views socialism's only hope as being the promotion of a highly technocratic-oriented leadership alongside an American Nationalism that shall glue the nation together where socialism can not. His American Worker's Party (AWP) is currently a combination of his followers who de facto left the SPA's Federalist faction with him, Lovestoneites, national-syndicalists and Howard Scott's Technocratic Movement. While the latter has questionable loyalties to socialism he has promised to place them in charge of the economy in return for allowing him to run the political sphere in the power-oriented method he views as necessary."
POLITICS_FERDINANDO_DESC:0 "Ferdinand of Bourbon-Two Sicilies' last 20 years have been troubled, as the relative tranquility of exile he lived in since his birth in 1869 was replaced with the responsibilities of being a monarch of a sovereign nation and the leader of the Italian Federation, at least in an interim fashion. Having arrived well after the civil war in Italy was concluded, his position was always fragile, and he himself knows he is little more than a puppet in the great game of Sicilian, Italian and global politics at large, as his presence legitimizes the Kingdom internationally and allows it to remain aligned with the powers that be in Europe, having effectively kept large scale syndicalist offensives at bay. His rule, while not without political issues, came after 6 years of war and strife, and he tries his utmost to ensure that he takes personal credit for this peace and relative prosperity. While he traditionally has kept himself away from political affairs, as he is aware of the fragility of the peace he and many work to mantain, the matter of the constant syndicalist threat, especially towards His Holiness in Rome, and his lack of a male heir, weigh heavily on him. The creeping feeling of powerlessness, even now as he is a monarch, makes him more prone to overtures by radical monarchists than even he himself realizes."

Admiring warrior-societies such as the Teutonic Knights, Roman Empire and Ancient Sparta, Evola claims that there is a Western tradition that must be revived to stand against the consumerism found in both capitalism and socialism. As such he is a fierce spiritualist and anti-materialist whom advocates forms of asceticism, holds the current Catholic Church in contempt for meekness and holds supernatural beliefs. His views would have stayed fringe had foreign powers not both passively propped up the unpopular Bourbon dynasty and exiled the House of Savoy, Evola's utter denunciation of which has won him support among nobles in exile including, apparently, the former King of Italy himself, whom Evola ultimately seeks to make the supreme power of the state."

His upbringing was tough, the streets of Brooklyn shaped his world views whilst his Catholic upbringing taught him that morals matter little in the modern world. Capone understood from a young age that in order to survive you have to be ruthless, the cutthroat world of business carved Capone into a prominent businessman profiteering off prohibition. Bootlegging proved successful and Capone expanded his growing empire into Chicago from where he took over failing businesses wrecked by economic stagnation. He also never forgot his roots and used his newfound wealth to set up soup kitchens for the homeless and provide honest work for the jobless. Despite accusations of involving himself with gangs and all sorts of illegal matters he developed a reputation amongst the working class as a “man of the people”. Capone became a prominent supporter of labour unions, especially the IWW, when the Second Civil War broke out Capone launched himself into politics. Aligning himself to the Centralist Faction, advocating for union control over all aspects of life he has clashed with anarcho-syndicalists who accuse him of being a potential dictator. Furthermore his gang affiliations have once again struck his credibility, accusations have emerged of Capone using the Chicago Mafia to intimidate political opponents.

It didn't keep him from being elected governor in 1935.

POLITICS_AMANULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Born in 1892, as the third son of Habibullah Khan, Amanullah Khan was, upon reaching proper age, installed as governor of Kabul and commander of the Army, gaining many important tribal allies. When the Weltkrieg broke out Amanullah, seeing this as a chance to seize lands on the other side of the Durand Line, joined Nasrullah in urging for joining into the Weltkrieg on the Kaiserreich’s side. When his father remained steadfast in his neutrality, Nasrullah and Amanullah, using mainly Amanullah’s tribal contacts, gathered up a force to invade the Raj. The initial push was a debacle and Amanullah was forced to retreat back into Afghanistan with the Raj hot on his heels. So began the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Amanullah was then forced to watch as his Army struggled to fight off the British and Indian invaders. However, when the Weltkrieg in Europe came to an end Afghanistan was given its due. Since then, however, Amanullah has seen his father grow fat and lazy on the throne and angled his way to become his successor. Now having triumphed over Nasrullah, his uncle, and former ally, Amanullah stands as the unchallenged Emir of Afghanistan. Amanullah is not content with just sitting on his present victories, however. He sees a future Afghanistan shining like a beacon of modernity in the roughness of Central Asia. He sees a future free of imperialist influence and the meddling of outside powers and their ‘spheres of influence’. For too long has mighty Afghanistan been forced to hide in the shade of the Raj, and the King of the God-granted Kingdom of Afghanistan and its dependencies been regarded as the leader of a second-rate power. Only through blood and steel shall the Afghan people carve their place in the Sun from the corpse of the British Empire, just as the Germans did. Now it remains to be seen if he can achieve his dream."
POLITICS_HABIBULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Habibullah's reign has thus far been marked by reforms and attempts to modernize his country by working to bring modern medicine and other technology to Afghanistan. Born in 1871, in Uzbekistan, he would rise to power in 1901, upon the death of his father, the previous Emir. Habibullah’s early reign was one of reform, as he quickly issued a general amnesty to his father’s many enemies, allowing them to return to the country. He also began to import new technology and further modern science within Afghanistan. He also was a social reformer, repealing many draconian criminal punishments while making the legal system fairer in general. One of his principal reforms was dismantling his father’s internal intelligence system that oppressed huge swaths of the country. In 1903, Habibullah founded the Habibia school as well as a military academy. \n\nWhen the Weltkrieg broke out, Habibullah took great pains to keep his nation neutral in the War. Despite the insistence of the Sultan in Istanbul and the Kaiser in Berlin, his proximity to India and the British made any intervention seemingly doomed to fail. This all changed with the defeat of the British in Europe and the ensuing revolutions that ripped through their Empire, however. As chaos gripped the Raj and British rule faltered, Habibullah was initially hesitant to do anything. This meant little to his generals, who quickly crossed the Durand Line and seized border towns of the Raj. Habibullah, unable to reverse this without appearing fatally weak, was forced to go along with this fait accompli. This bolstered his popularity at home since the Raj, still battling for its own survival, was unable to resist.\n\nTwenty years after his victory, Habibullah has had to watch his grand dream of a powerful Afghanistan begin to wither. In the hinterlands, rebellion has once again reared its ugly head while members of his own family eye the crown hungrily. If Afghanistan is to be truly stable, Habibullah knows he must do something."
POLITICS_KALAKANI_DESC:0 "Habibullah Kalakani was born in 1891 in the village of Kalakan, north of Kabul. An ethnic Tajik, his father was named Aminullah and delivered water to people's homes. This heritage is how Kalakani gained the nickname ‘Bacha-ye Saqao’, or son of the watter carrier. During his adolescence, Kalakani ventured out of his village and traveled to the city of Kabul. In the south, he met an old Sufi who told the young Habibullah that he would become king one day. He would fight with the Afghan Army in the Third Anglo-Afghan War and the Khost Rebellion. They say there are no atheists in a fox hole, and Habibullah is an extreme example of that. When he deserted his unit during the Khost Rebellion he left a changed man, devoted seemingly entirely to Allah and his faith. After nearly a year in prison, Habibullah was released and turned to banditry since he saw many menial jobs like viticulture and firewood selling beneath him. He gradually gathered a group of 24 around him and they robbed caravans during the day and hid out at night, continuously evading government attempts to find him. While Habibullah grew fat and lazy in Kabul however, Kalakani grew angry and zealous in his caves. He began to denounce the Khan as little more than a German puppet and suggested that he had to be overthrown if Allah’s grace was to return to Afghanistan. It was about this time he began to refer to himself as both King and Emir. He began to meet with tribal leaders in the West of the country and gathered around himself a small but very effective army. Afghan Army units sent to round him up were routed or brought over to his cause and it was not long before Kalakani became the real authority in Western Afghanistan. However, despite his growing power, he was reluctant to strike at Kabul and tear the heart out of the decadent regime he had come to despise. That time came eventually with the catastrophic war against the Raj, and despite all odds, Kalakani now has seized the reins of government. What he intends to do with his newfound power however only Kalakani and Allah know and neither of them seems interested in telling."
POLITICS_NASRULLAH_KHAN_DESC:0 "Nasrullah Khan was born in 1874, the second of three sons to Emir Abdur Rahman. As a young man in his early 20s, Nasrullah was sent on a journey to the UK to pay his father’s respect to Queen Victoria. Since he spoke little English and did not make a good impression on the local press who described him as a 'stolid, impassive and bored youth'. Nevertheless, he paid his respects as demanded and after a detour through Paris and Italy, returned home. This experience, while considered a diplomatic failure, prepared the young man for life in statecraft. When his older brother Habibullah rose to the throne, Nasrullah was suddenly one of the most important men in Afghanistan, if not more so than before. \n\nFirst to court him were the religious authorities who languished under his father Abdur. Nasrullah was a deeply religious man by this point and quickly warmed to their influence. The second was his brother, the Emir, who saw him as a potential rival. To secure his loyalty, Habibullah made him Commander in Chief, President of the State Council, and later heir over his own sons. Nasrullah was also kept loyal by the fact that the Emir held their brother, Mohammed, and Mohammed’s mother as little more than prisoners. Nasrullah was no Claudius, for he was loyal to Habibullah throughout his reign.\n\nDuring this time Nasrullah also grew to despise the British, despite his early venture to the Isles. The British had, under an earlier treaty, kept the Afghan government from maintaining valuable alliances with the powerful tribes of the Afghan hinterlands. At the same time, British influence began to slowly creep deeper and deeper into Afghanistan, which Nasrullah saw as a threat to his family and his people. When the Weltkrieg broke out, Nasrullah saw his chance to strike decisively at the British. He, along with the Young Afghan movement, urged the Emir to join the war on the side of the Turks and Germans. To their frustration, Habibullah remained neutral. When the Niedermayer Hentig Expedition arrived in Afghanistan, Nasrullah found a new group of loyal allies. Along with the Expedition, Nasrullah proposed numerous ways to undermine the British but all of them were dismissed by the Emir. As the Germans’ victory seemed imminent, however, Nasrullah finally got fed up with waiting for his brother. Without orders Nasrullah helped round up a group of tribes on the border and invaded the Raj. He was beaten, decisively and the nation he loved was dragged into a devastating war. When the Weltkrieg ended, so did the Third Anglo-Afghan War and Nasrullah Khan had achieved his dream. \n\nTwenty years later, Nasrullah now sits at the helm of his beloved nation, having defeated usurper and conspirator alike. With Allah guiding him, who can stand between him and greatness?"

POLITICS_NADIR_SHAH_DESC:0 "The wild card’s hand has been revealed for the world to see. Born to an exiled branch of the royal family in India, Mohammed Nadir Shah would return to Afghanistan only in the early 1900s, when Habibullah Khan married Nadir’s sister. He served admirably in Habibullah’s government until the outbreak of the Third Anglo-Afghan War. While faring decent against the seasoned British forces, he was never able to gain the successes needed to cripple the Raj. Instead, he was forced to fight on for years until an end to the war in Europe forced an end to the War in Afghanistan.\n\nWhile Afghanistan had triumphed, Nadir was left with a bitter aftertaste, and he was further enraged by radical proposals for the modernization of Afghanistan. While no traditionalist like Nasrullah, Nadir felt that some of Habibullah’s more ambitious reforms, no doubt suggested by his son Amanullah, were too far, stripping Afghanistan of its identity. During this era of peace, if not animosity, the British have appealed to Nadir Shah, promising him the throne in exchange for his cooperation. Now Nadir rules in Afghanistan with undeniable help from his former enemies, the British. While few expect him to kowtow to Delhi and Ottawa for long, even fewer see his reign as one of continuing reform. Nadir instead seems to want to propel Afghanistan into the future, but also pay respects to its admirable past. Whether or not he can continue this balancing act remains to be determined."
POLITICS_LOVECRAFT_DESC:0 "H.P. Lovecraft, born in Providence, Rhode Island in 1890, is perhaps one of the most mysterious and controversial figures of the 20th century. His father dying when he was 8, his mother dying of the Spanish Flu in late 1918, and Lovecraft suffering from a plethora of health issues his entire life have led Lovecraft into a search for truth and deep meaning, which he channeled into his writings. Tales of darkness and horror within resonated strongly with an America reeling from the 1925 market crash. Lovecraft's science fiction gained him a serious audience for his thoughts on politics and philosophy. He rapidly gained an almost cult-like status in his home state of Rhode Island and drew many followers, preaching a dark and otherworldly message about supernatural powers and eldritch beings that are incomprehensible to the human mind. As president of the New England Literary Society, Lovecraft standardized the use of the English language in print, removing what he called 'Americanisms'. When he traveled to England in 1924 to study the English language and attempt to purify it as much as possible, he witnessed the 1925 uprising and grew an acute hatred of Syndicalism. He returned to America in 1930, founded his own newspaper and ran unsuccessfully for governor of Rhode Island. He remained a prominent thought leader and a powerful influence on the minds of New Englanders, although his opponents accuse Lovecraft of being a dangerous man with authoritarian and occultist inclinations."

However, his influential steps did not end there; Pickett became known as an advocate for Christian pacifism, as he counseled his fellow faithful on their purpose in life during the First Weltkrieg.

After publishing political thought directly inspired by his mentor, Sorel, he became an acquaintance of monarchist writer Charles Maurras. Joining Maurras’s movement, Action Française, he developed his ideology of fusing working-class based politics with monarchism. In 1911 he founded the Cercle Proudhon with fellow AF comrades, this group espoused national-syndicalism, integral nationalism and antisemitism whilst rejecting liberal and conservative democracy. Overtime as syndicalist movements evolved throughout France, the Cercle became overtly left-wing whilst maintaining an aggressively nationalist stance on world politics. When the French Civil War broke out, Valois took advantage of the crisis by turning his group into a fully fledged political movement. The Sorelians were born, disowning any previous reactionary views, Valois and his comrades took to streets of a broken France to demand the destruction of the French Third Republic.\n\n Now he has become chairman of the Bourse Générale du Travail.

This all changed however with the outbreak of the Weltkrieg where he patriotically signed up to fight off the German horde in defense of the French nation rising through the ranks and winning admiration for fellow french patriots and friends in the trenches. No matter how hard he fought however the horrors of the war cemented his personal hatred for Germany and its mistreatment of the French people. Originally a reactionary, the Weltkrieg provided him with a deep hatred for the French upper-class who he saw as cowards for surrendering to the Germans. The revolutionary period that swept France saw the Bankers, Liberals, Capitalists, the exploiters of the French nation abandon it and flee with the riches of its people. Countering this was of the utmost personal importance to Bucard who joined Valois’s Sorelians, eventually taking leadership of his own faction, the ‘Ultranationalist-Syndicalists’. Giving speeches towards crowds of disenfranchised French patriots against 'Ruthless banking clans' and their 'Liberal lapdogs' he easily recruited among the galvanized Weltkrieg veterans.\n\nNow in control as the Chief of the National Worker’s State, Bucard sees the destruction of the German Empire as his main objective.

His time in the SFIO introduced him to Marxist thought, causing him to become enamored with the ideas of Communism and a very enthusiastic supporter of the Bolshevik uprising in Russia. The ultimate failure of the Bolsheviks led Thorez to conclude that they had not been pure or strong enough, that they had failed both Lenin, Marx, and Robespierre by their inability to take every measure necessary for the revolution. Thorez would take up arms in the Second French Revolution, declaring himself as a syndicalist to disguise his true communist nature. A charismatic leader, many flocked to him for his bold speeches and devotion to the Revolution. Once the Commune of France had been established, however, he revealed his true colors, declaring the Commune a bourgeois fourth republic, and converting his followers to the ways of communism. Now calling themselves the “Jacobins” after the radicals of Robespierre, Thorez and his followers became an immense thorn in the side of the CGT. Considering himself to be the successor to Robespierre and Lenin, Thorez would be dismissed as a political failure for his inability to win a seat in the CGT.

POLITICS_BIG_BILL_HAYWOOD_DESC:0 "If there ever was a man to represent the power of the working class, it would be William Haywood. Haywood has seen all corners of the country and lived alongside the working man. Haywood opposed Craft Unionism, which he felt could be divided and conquered by Capital. Instead founding one union, the International Workers of the World, meant to represent all working interests.  As the founder of the IWW, 'Big Bill' has battled the enemies of the people throughout his life: The capitalist opportunists, the labor slavehandlers, and even agents of the government. Quick to anger and unafraid of action, Haywood is the Man for Labor and the Man for America."

POLITICS_HONGWU_DESC:0 "Once abandoned by the world and left to rot in obscurity, the Marquis of Extended Grace Zhu Yuxun has returned to prominence and now sits on the Dragon Throne as the first Ming Emperor in over 300 years. Born in 1882 as the son of the former Marquis of Zhu before him, Zhu Yuxun was once lavished in the courts of Beijing as an honored guest and confidant to Puyi. With the arrival of the Germans, however, Zhu Yuxun was cast out from his paradise-like life of extravagance and forced into hard exile, spending these passing years hiding out in Manchuria. With the rise of the Three Harmonies Society and their dominance over China secured, the honored Dragon Head of the Triads invited Zhu Yuxun back to Beijing to take his seat at his rightful throne.

POLITICS_KAZEMBEK_DESC:0"Little would have predicted that Alexander Kazembek would end up in the position he is in today. It seems as if his life may just be a lesson on the instability of the universe; of the chaos of politics and human existence. Born to a noble Iranian-Azerbaijani family, Kazembek saw the brunt of the Russian Revolution; something that undoubtably shaped his eccentric political views. However, instead of turning him against the Soviets, the Revolution endeared in him a certain level of respect for the Soviet System. And even though the Red Revolution failed; Kazembek still incorporated parts of the Soviet Ideals into his personal politics. \n\n His Charisma and experience as an Orator put him at the forefront of the new “Young Russia” group, a group that rejected Reactionary Tsarism in favour of a “New and Dynamic Vision”. As the situation in Russia deteriorated, Professor Nikolai Ustryalov convinced Party Secretary Kazembek to side with Alexander Kolchak and his coup against the Petrograd Government. Kolchak’s coup however failed; resulting in the creation of the state of Transamur; the rump state where Kazembek and Ustryalov fled to. These series of events led to Ustryalov and Kazembek rejecting the ideology of the Whites in favour of the Bolsheviks. This idealization lead to the development of the concept of a “Labour Monarchy”, and a system that combines Soviet democracy, Orthodox Integralism, Russian nationalism and the "revolutionary spirit". And as his Ideology grew and Changed, so did the influence of the Mladorossi within Transamur. Their influence grew and expanded, to a point where they could seize power following the Anti- Kolchak Coup. \n\n Now, Kazembek stands as the “Vozd” of the Rump State of Transamur. And though his influence may be currently small, Kazembek has plans to restore the Tsar, and soon reclaim all of Russia "
POLITICS_KYRIL_ROMANOV_MLAD_DESC:0 "Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, now Kirill I of Russia, is one of the most troublesome members of the House of Romanov. Strong-willed, ambitious, and determined to seize the throne, he has caused a headache to his first cousin, Nikolay II, several times. It is an open secret that during the February Revolution, Kirill actively worked against the Tsar and the rest of the House, even to the point where he ordered his men to raise the red flag above Petrograd - not because of any dedication to revolutionary ideals, but because of the hopes that he would become regent, or possibly even Tsar, after his cousin's abdication. \n\nAfter the execution of Nikolay and his family, Kirill claimed his rule over the scattered house of Romanov, a claim which was hotly contested by the rest of the family, who claimed that Kirill had no right to a restored Russian throne nor to lead the Russian royal family. By 1929, however, he was ultimately recognized, the untimely death of Grand Duke Nikolay certainly helped. While Kirill begrudgingly pays lip service to the Mladorossi, it truly doesn't matter to him who holds the keys to power; as long as he is in charge in some form. Even if Kirill is under practical House Arrest, and not but a powerless figurehead compared to Vozd Kazembek"
POLITICS_VLADIMIR_PURISHKEVICH_DESC:0 "Vladimir Purishkevich was born on August 24th, 1870 to an impoverished noble family. Despite his beginnings, he was able to earn a degree in classics, and his interest in politics only grew from there. In 1905, during the Russian Revolution, he was one of the principal founders of the powerful Black Hundredist movement. At the time, the movement suffered from crippling infighting, and Puriskevich himself had several rivals in the organization. Puriskevich had a role in the 1916 killing of Grigori Rasputin, believing his influence on the Tsarina and the country as a whole to be too dangerous to ignore. He developed many of his strongly anti-semitic, nationalist, and monarchist views during the Russian Civil War, in which he came to believe in an open fight against Jewry. \n\nWhen the Civil War ended, Puriskevich was not idle. His restlessness and charisma were powerful tools that he used to great success in propelling the RNSMA to national status, but they remained a fringe organization due to the existence of the republic. Now that they are in power, this situation has changed. Though he is old, Puriskevich will not squander the opportunity he has been waiting for for decades. His plans to restore the Russian Empire to greatness as one nation under one tsar will not be stopped by any means, and he will see to it that Russia is no longer the laughing stock of the world."

With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. Disney would run for President in 1940 and despite all odds, he managed to win the nomination for President. He then proceeded to win the election for the Republicans.

Born Charles Ross Norton in 1881, he was the great nephew of a madman who declared himself Emperor of the United States, little did he know however that this event would lead to more madness within his own lifetime. For the majority of his life, Norton had lived a quiet, peaceful life in South Africa; even having a son by the name of Gerard Norton. Even after the Weltkrieg, nothing dramatically changed for him, his life was quiet and simple. \n\n That was until he was invited to a party in San Francisco on one fateful day. What started out as a gathering of 'Nortonites' led to him being swept up into the political upheaval and chaos plaguing the Pacific States at that time. Before he knew what was going on, he was being crowned Emperor Norton II in San Francisco, and after that; oddly enough came peace. Though he has attracted several loyal members and people who are willing to fight to the death for him, Norton is getting older with time. To many, he almost seems reluctant to the position of Emperor. But every morning he gets out of bed determined to at least do something about the problems he and his subjects face."

With the outbreak of the civil war, Walt pledged his full support for the Pacific Government and declared his intent for the Presidency. However, as the political scene changed; so did Disney. After Arnold’s intervention, Disney abandoned the Republican Party and along with Howard Hughes, formed the National Visionary Party. When Disney was elected, stability and prosperity was expected; however, the opposite came, and after the Nation begun to collapse, Disney had to take drastic measures. The democratic process is worthless, all it has done is send America on a downward spiral. Because of this, Disney has done away with the democratic forces that are hindering his Visionary plans. The so-called 'Visionary Party' has stacked the government with people loyal to Disney and his plans for America and instituted a dictatorship with Disney at its head. The voices of the opposition are now silent, the chaos has ended. And with his power base secured, Disney can begin his plans for the nation, whatever that will entail is up to Disney himself, who has the full support of the government. Many now believe that under President Disney's guidance America will not only prosper but it will rise to heights never seen before, but only time will tell if, and when such a thing will happen."

The Bounty on his head is still over 10,000$, most citizens of his now-native Paraguay view him as an illegitimate foreigner; and he has been forced to learn the native tongue.

During his younger years, Aiso was treated poorly by his peers due to the Anti-Japanese sentiment that was high in America at the time. Aiso attended Hollywood High School in the 20's where he gained national attention for his victory in the school's constitution oration contest, however he was not allowed to compete on the national level. Aiso also spent a year in Japan at Seijo University after he graduated in 1926, until he attended Brown University in the United States where he graduated Cum Laude and served as class Valedictorian in 1931. He completed his degree after going to Harvard in 1934.

He attended the Lahne Military Institute, but advanced slowly in his officer's career, in part because he was abusive and violent toward his own men. He served in the Austro-Hungarian army as a cavalry captain during the Weltkrieg, but remained a mid-level officer. After the Weltkrieg, Prónay joined with many Hungarian Weltkrieg veterans in supporting far-right, nationalist politics. He was most influenced by the views of Gyula Gömbös, though he disagreed with his anti-Habsburg sentiments. That is, until the Emperor unveiled his plans for the national dismemberment of the Kingdom of Hungary, into a collection of minority states. Prónay now carries on the legacy of Gömbös and intends to implement his socio-economic system of 'National Socialism' throughout Hungary."

He entered cadet school in Vienna to become a professional officer, finishing at the top of his class in 1893. Prior to the outbreak of war, Lehár joined the general staff and served as a musketry instructor, where his skill was honored even by foreign governments in Romania and Turkey. Lehár's leadership and valor during the Weltkrieg saw him severely wounded and rewarded with the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa, ennobling him with the title 'Freiherr von.' Despite his wounds and value as a training officer, he repeatedly requested assignments to the front to command men in battle.

Before the Weltkrieg, he was a muck-raking journalist with sympathies for the Hungarian Social Democratic Party in Kolozsvár. In addition, Kun served on the Kolozsvár Social Insurance Board (and was later accused of embezzling board funds). He had a fiery reputation and was involved in several duels. Kun fought in the Weltkrieg for Austria-Hungary, but was captured by the Russians. It was during this time that he became interested in communism. Ultimately, he became a supporter of the failed Bolshevik revolution, and became a permanent exile after the victorious Germans put a stop to Bolshevism. However, this did not stop Kun from founding the Hungarian Communist Party with his fellow Hungarian exiles, Mátyás Rákosi and Tibor Szamuely. When the Commune was born in Paris, Kun found asylum in France, where he continued to plot Hungary's revolution."

In 1910, as a student, he joined the Hungarian Social Democratic Party (MSZDP) and was also a secretary and active member of the anarcho-syndicalist student movement, the Galilei Circle. He served in the Austro-Hungarian Army during the First World War and was captured on the Eastern Front in 1915 and held as a prisoner-of-war in Far Eastern POW camps by the Russians until the end of the war. During the chaos of the Bolshevik Revolution, he escaped bondage and joined the revolutionaries in Petrograd. Once Russia's revolution failed, he joined Kun's clique of Hungarian socialist revolutionaries. Unlike Kun, prone to violent temper and disliked by many party operatives, Rákosi seems able to 'work the system.' This is not to say he is any less violent or brutal than Kun, only that he knows when to pick his battles, and dispatches not merely his enemies, but his enemies' families as well."

In 1909, he became the President of the OMGE (National Agricultural Society), the main rural organization of the nobility. Initially a supporter of the existing political and social system in Hungary, Károlyi gradually became more progressive and left-wing during his career. During the Weltkrieg, the pro-Entente Károlyi led a small but very active pacifist anti-war maverick fraction in the Hungarian parliament. For most, such a position would have meant political suicide after the war, but Károlyi has parleyed anti-Habsburg sentiment within Hungary, stoked by the Second Ausgleich of 1927, to take the reins of the pro-independence movement as leader of the Party of Independence."

In 1936, he became one of the nation's most prominent politicians when he took control of the National Constitution Party, a conservative Hungarian political party opposed to the Second Ausgleich and continued Austrian interference, but not committed to the same radical social reforms promised by his rivals like Károlyi and Szakasits."

Yet, Friedrich's idealism did not survive the Weltkrieg, and he eventually drifted away from the socially radical aspects of Károlyi's platform, while still supporting independence.

These are all positions held by John MacCormick, the man who hopes to free the Scottish Nation from English Tyranny. From an early age MacCormick was a fervent supporter of Scottish Home Rule, a position he would hold for the rest of his life. However, despite his oratory talents and large support base; Scottish Nationalism was suppressed by the more radical factions within the now Union of Britain; something exacerbated by his acceptance of more right-wing groups into his organization. Within time his organization was forced to go underground. This was the foundation of the modern Homeland Watch; an organization that was nothing but a fringe terror group at the time. But, as the Union of Britain disintegrated under Mosley’s totalitarian rule, the Homeland Watch took control over Scotland where the Brits had failed. And with the government crippled, MacCormick saw his chance to finally break the shackles that England has imposed on Scotland. The time was now, Scotland was to be free and there was no longer anyone to stop it."

He served in France during the First World War, and after that would serve as a teacher who would conduct lectures in Welsh. Lewis had saw what had been achieved in Ireland, and with that was inspired along with many others to strive for the complete independence of Wales. And as the British Revolution came, the time to act against the Anglo oppressors was now. Lewis founded the "National Party of Wales", which’s had goals to make a fully Welsh-Speaking Wales; however, through the years found itself drawn into the storm of military conflict with the newly formed Union of Britain. This drew Lewis’ party underground and formed out of it the Welsh Home Rule Army, a terrorist organization dedicated to Welsh Independence. Normally it would have stayed as a mere terrorist group, but the collapse of the Union of Britain and the subsequent succession of Scotland lead to Wales too abandoning the Union of Britain. And with the UOB’s collapse, the WHRA rose up against the tyrannical forces of Mosley to help establish an independent Wales. However, they made peace with Y’ Glais’ socialist government to do so. But once the war ended, Lewis deposed Y’ Glais, and to pander to the international stage established a “Regency Council”. This however did not lead to a King being crowned, and after it’s disillusion Lewis became the unchallenged master of Wales. Its destiny is still unclear, but regardless one thing will persevere under Lewis’ Rule: Wales’ freedom"

This service and representation put him into the sight of Caroll who assigned him to his cabinet and had him continue to be the loyal preacher to the rapidly changing America.

Archregent Al Smith is one such politician - a rare unsullied gem amid a sea of wolves and schemers. Born in 1873 in Manhattan to a working class Catholic Irish immigrants, Smith got a start into politics young by falling in with ‘Silent’ Charlie Murphy and the Tammany Hall group. It was in these young years that Smith solidified his reformist ideals and love for the working man - a foundation that would fuel his explosive career to new heights. Long dominating New York’s political stage as a member of the infamous Tammany Hall political machine that helped his rise and later as a leader the successful Efficiency Movement aimed at reforming the legislation that was leading his state to decay, Smith had become as famous nationwide for being one of the only successful Catholic politicians has he had been for his unending slew of successful legislation. Now, as Archregent, Smith has cast off the doubters who once whispered that the Pope would dictate his every whim, for no being or mantra guides Smith in his policy other than his dual faiths in good, honest governance and the Lord."

POLITICS_CATHOLIC_DAY_DESC:0 "Few have been able to balance a deep sense of socialist justice while still holding true to pure Christian principles as well as now-Archregent Dorothy Day. Born into a middle class Anglo-Irish family in Brooklyn in 1897, Day’s own religious awakening was brought on by her own reading, practice, and study; her parents being nominal Christians at best, driving Day to find God in her own way. After this Christianity-fueled interest consumed her childhood, Day spent her adolescence living the Bohemian dream, traveling across the nation as a journalist and vagabond, picking up new influences and ideas as she bounced from one Christian sect and Socialist ideology to another in her quest to find herself. After over a decade of soul-searching, as well as dealing with the trials of new motherhood, the American Civil War, and balancing her loyalties to her Socialist contacts in the IWW and her episcopal contacts in the former-Union State, Day has grown into one of the most unique and tempered political leaders in the Holy American League. Though many still distrust her Socialist sympathies, all true believers know Day’s love of Socialism comes not from a love of dusty, dated theory, but from seeing it as the loving, egalitarian will of the Lord himself. She shall be the prophet that shows America the light of true, non-bastardized Socialism - a Socialism bathed in God’s glory and tempered through piety."

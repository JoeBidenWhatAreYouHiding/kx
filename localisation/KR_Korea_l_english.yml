korea.2.d:0 "For centuries Korea has been under the boot of foreign powers from the various Chinese dynasties to the Japanese Empire but now we have secured our independence.

korea.3.t:0 "The State Of Korea"
korea.3.d:0 "While Korea is independent, many factions have different and competing views for the country, especially in terms of how our politics should be made up. This often leads to violent confrontations in the streets and various anarchist societies have conducted a campaign of terror against the civilian populace. On the world stage Korea is recognized by few powers, hampering our ability to conduct trade and foreign affairs. Our Army, the Korean Defense Forces, is a shambolic mess, with its high command lacking any real structure or unified doctrine and our economy is non-existent, only made worse by the lack of trade."
korea.3.a:0 "This doesn't bode well"
korea.4.t:0 "The Occupation"
korea.4.d:0 "When foreign troops walked over our soil, driving out the Japanese occupiers many assumed this was the beginning of Korean independence. In reality little has really changed since the initial occupation. The country is bound by martial law and soldiers patrol the streets while the doors to the National Assembly remain chained shut. General Hong Sa-ik rules with an iron fist and bows down to our captors. To many Koreans life will go on as before with independence a pipe dream."

Shortly after its establishment, the last Crown Prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Un appeared in Seoul flanked by supporters in the Korean Nationalist Party (KNP) calling for a restoration of the monarchy. Practically all parties in the assembly are opposed to the inclusion of monarchist elements but the final choice rests with President Chong.\nHowever more radical elements have made chilling threats. The Anarchists have warned that if the monarchists take their seats they will begin a campaign of terror and the Supreme War Council has said that if a dark day falls on Korea it no longer has confidence in the government's ability."

Similarly strange events have taken place elsewhere; military trains arrive late, or not at all. Monarchist officers disappear without a trace and entire countryside barracks have vanished, brick by brick with only a concrete base left.

korea.8.a:0 "How strange"
korea.9.t:0 "The Power Struggle"
korea.9.d:0 "It seems that letting the monarchists into the assembly was a horrible idea after all. At midnight last night Kim Koo was returning to the Presidential Palace by car when a horrible explosion rocked the street. His personal bodyguards were shot by masked men who quickly surrounded the area. Though the President managed to escape with his driver there whereabouts are unknown. With the President out of the way the terrorists quickly converged onto the Presidential Palace killing anyone they encountered and declaring over radio the establishment of the Korean Free Territory. \nEnraged, members of the Supreme War Council immediately dispatched the Seoul garrison to shut down the uprising which immediately spilled over to a full blown battle as anarchist supporters were rallied. After contious fighting the dust finally settled and the winner was..."

korea.10.d:0 "Represenatives of the KNP took their seats in the assembley today and immediately caused trouble. The debate was marred by speakers being drowned out, unruly chanting and poor behaviour on both sides. After allegations of the KNP bribing members of the liberal factions emerged, practically all represenatives of the government have abandoned the assembly with the monarchists proclaiming victory. Acting President Kim Koo was offered the title of regent but denied it. Regardless the results are a foregone conclusion."

With a resounding victory for the monarchists, many began to applaud but this could not drown out the rattling and screams coming from the corridor. Witness reports are sketchy but supposedly a group of armed, masked men stormed the room and began firing randomly at all assembly members. Newspapers are already blaming syndicalist agitators but some think the nobility could be behind this.

korea.18.t:0 "The Absolute Korea"

korea.19.t:0 "The Constitutional Korea"

A commotion began outside before the door crashed and a squad of soldiers stormed the room killing the two men and seizing their haul. \nIn the north most of their major leaders crossed the Yulu river arriving on a small jetty to discuss the impending revolution, not yet aware of the crackdown. Just as they moved onto the port gunfire rang out and the leaders were killed. \nAll across the country underground raids have taken place to a stunning success. With anarchism in Korea defeated it will not prove to be a hindrance much more."

korea.22.t:0 "The Liberal Agitators"
korea.22.d:0 "Some of our main opposition have come from the various liberal factions gathered primarily under Kim Koo. Currently their parties are not in a state of de jure legality though still subject to arbitary arrest and imprisonment. Their lobbying continues to be a thorn in our side.

While many of these are moderate in nature simply agitating for better working conditions and some have official affiliation with the KSP, others belong to the radical syndicalist Workers Liberation Congress of Free Korea, often considered little more than a front for anarchist agitators. We can choose to allow these unions to operate unhindered, leading to increased industrial disputes but healing the political divides or simply ban unions in favour of state controlled ones."

korea.32.d:0 "It is unfortunate but this is a time of war and some members of the Supreme War Council have proposed a massive propaganda campaign to vilify the Japanese interlopers and stir our people up into action. While some members of the government have expressed worries this could backfire, most members agree a campaign is needed in some form. On the other end of the spectrum, officers affiliated with the radical nationalist 'Young Korea' party have proposed an all-out campaign totally vilifying the Japanese. How should we proceed?"

korea.34.d:0 "The Non-Discriminatory Conscription Bill has landed on the presidents desk and proposes extending the draft powers of the army, albeit vaguely worded. Practically all members of the government and the SWC agree that the conscription age should be extended while most members of the SWC believe in it going further to all mem serving as well as women being prepared for guerilla warfare. Many lower officers support the vague nature of the bill and believe that it should kept this way so as to allow local officers to press whoever they see fit into service. How should we proceed?"

korea.35.t:0 "The Hospital Of Death"
korea.35.d:0 "Our anti-Japanese campaign has been suprisingly effective. Perhaps too effective...The urban centres we can control are being flooded with rural Japanese refugees who initially attempted escape via the Japanese lines. However many of these refugees report that roving bands of militias comprised of radicalized peasents and rogue soldiers guard the lines either turning back the refugees or outright killing them. \nWith these refugees flooding our territories many report of a so called 'Hospital of Death' deep inside the countryside. A few of these refugees claim to be survivors while many others talk of losing injured and sick relatives to these fake good samaritans. The survivors talk of torture and twisted killings within the hospital walls. \nThe story has already spread among the population with many native Koreans coming forward and saying they too are victims of the hospital. Tensions are rising with the angered Japanese and the Koreans as both sides try to claim victimhood and a mass hysteria is spreading with many citizens shunning hospitals in fear of becoming the next victims. \nThe Supreme War Council argue this is little more than a hoax while the government wishes to launch an investigation. Our resources our scarce but if we don't investigate this could cost us on the world stage..."
korea.35.a:0 "Launch the investigation!"
korea.35.b:0 "What childish fantasy"
korea.36.t:0 "Death In the Air"
korea.36.d:0 "It was a cool evening and the wind blew gently across the plains as clouds cleared and the moonlight shined down on the fields. Deep in the countryside a small unit of soldiers watched from their hillside vantage of a lonely but large building. Adorned with red crosses on a white field it was undeniably the hospital the survivors talked about. \nFast as the wind the soldiers encircled the building and quickly divulged on its position storming the building and attacking any poorly equipped guards they encountered and arresting the medical staff, rescuing the patients. After a few hours the operation was a success, the refugees liberated and the doctors arrested. As this gallant effort by our men reaches the international press the mass hysteria at home is calmed and we can put this ugly chapter in our history to rest."
korea.36.a:0 "A happy ending to a grim tale."
korea.37.t:0 "Too Late"
korea.37.d:0 "It was a cool evening and the wind blew gently across the planes as clouds cleared and the moonlight shone down on the fields. Deep in the countryside a small unit of soldiers massed on the hillside plains ready to strike. \nIn the distance black smoke could be seen over the hills and the soldiers rushed to action. Something was wrong. Very wrong. \nWhen they reached the site of the hospital they could make out what appeared to be the building, lit up in flames. Unable to do anything they simply watched as the hospital burned. In the aftermath little remains or evidence could be found. It appeared somebody had tipped them off as to the investigation. While the hospital is confirmed to be destroyed and Japanese refugees can breathe easy, many are angered that the culprits may never be brought to justice and the truth of what happened will never be known."
korea.37.a:0 "I want the head of the rat on my desk!"
korea.38.t:0 "A Hoax"
korea.38.d:0 "It was a cool evening and the wind blew gently across the planes as clouds cleared and the moonlight shone down on the fields. Deep in the countryside a small unit of soldiers watched from their hillside vantage of a lonely but large building. Adorned with red crosses on a white field it was undeniably the hospital the survivors talked about. \nFast as the wind the soldiers began to encircle the building and with a thunderous roar, artillery fire lit up the night and rained down on the hospital. \nWhen the assault ended soldiers stormed the burning ruins and began attack guards and medical staff at random with many patients dying in the chaos. But for now the mission was complete. \nIt didn't take long for the military to catch on. The place attacked was a registered military hospital providing aid to local citizens. As the authorities scrambled to find the survivors they had disappeared in the night. It appears the military were right. \nIt was a hoax all along."
korea.38.a:0 "How could we let this happen...?"
korea.39.t:0 "The Japanese Discovery"
korea.39.d:0 "As they push further into our lines, the Japanese appear to have made a grim discovery: the Hospital of Death. While initially dismissed as little more than propaganda, international war correspondents present have confirmed its existence as well as various disturbing entities within. The IJA allege that the hospital is part of a web of similarly designed institutions and have encouraged Japanese citizens within Korea to escape before they meet their own end. \nAs if the situation wasn't bad enough this final message has sent our people into a major panic as hospitals are burned down, doctors attacked and tensions with the Japanese present has reached a critical point with open fighting. It seems not investigating was a grave mistake."
korea.39.a:0 "Lies! It has to be lies!"
korea.40.t:0 "Protests At The Factories"
korea.40.d:0 "Our incredibly harsh factory conversion policy seems to have angered much of the population. With practically all non-soldiers pressed into the industrial corps, many workers are finding their previous places employment and in some cases, even their homes, have been converted in munitions factories. Agitated by the anarchists, many have thrown down their tools in protest and refuse to go back to work, demanding that the government soften the conversion policy. In response soldiers have opened fire on the protestors who have been dispersed. At least for now."
korea.40.a:0 "It's hard but we must all do our part for the war effort."
korea.41.t:0 "Chaos In The Ranks"
korea.41.d:0 "Our conscription policy has not been well-received. While draft riots were to be expected, reports are coming in of men cutting off their hands to avoid service after a roll-out of the controversial 'rifle' policy in which any candidate capable of holding a rifle has been conscripted. \nSketchy reports have come in from the South about an entire village massacred after tensions reached a boiling point when an elderly man missing his left arm was executed for treason. While the story is likely fictional the damage has already been done and public anger is reaching new levels."
korea.41.a:0 "Just when things couldn't get any worse."
korea.42.t:0 "The Executive Powers Bill"
korea.42.d:0 "With chaos erupting all over our fledgling republic it seems our end is near. In a last desperate attempt the Supreme War Council has proposed the passing of 'The Executive Powers Act'. While the bill itself only seeks to combine the current acts into a single document it has been declared as tyrannical by all those outside of the SWC and the President's personal council. But without the bill our efforts to consolidate power could be undone..."
korea.42.a:0 "Veto the bill. It could backfire badly..."
korea.42.b:0 "Dissolve the provisional parliament and force the bill through."
korea.43.t:0 "Societal Collapse"
korea.43.d:0 "When the announcement that the new bill had passed via force the country exploded into conflict with factions all across the country decrying it as a slip into tyranny. Rather than alleviate the issues of the seperate bills it has only made things worse as soldiers mutiny, factory workers lay down their tools and refugees, Japanese and Korean, make for the seas to find safety. The dream of independence is dead."
korea.43.a:0 "Annyeong Hangug"
korea.44.t:0 "The Japanese Withdrawal"
korea.44.d:0 "In a surprising twist of events the Japanese administration in Seoul has formally announced it will be leaving Korea and establishing a partially independent government under Japanese guidance. While not the total independence many desired it marks a significant victory for the independence supporters and shift in Japanese attitudes to us. May this be the beginning of a brighter future."
korea.44.a:0 "What a pleasent suprise!"
korea.45.t:0 "A Visit From the Emperor"
korea.45.d:0 "In a much anticipated affair Emperor Hirohito of the Japanese Empire has arrived in Seoul to much fanfare for a meeting with delegates from our government and then onto a brief tour of the nation. While some independence activists are boycotting the visit, many of our people are hopeful this is the beginning of a long and fruitful friendship with Japan."
korea.45.a:0 "He's quite the unifying figure!"
korea.46.t:0 "The Two Monarchs"
korea.46.d:0 "King Yi Un has arrived in Tokyo today as part of a state visit to compliment the previous visit by Emperor Hirohito. The Japanese press have lavished much fanfare on our benevolent King and it seems that relations between our two nations are beginning to heal. This will likely be the first of many friendly visits."
korea.46.a:0 "Have a good trip!"
korea.47.t:0 "Restoring Order"
korea.47.d:0 "Our path to rule has been fraught with violence and conflict. It is a necessity that the revolution is bloody. Currently our rule is tenuous and reactionaries seek to quickly counter our revolution. They must be stamped out before they can do any real damage to our fledgling socialist utopia."
korea.47.a:0 "Stop right there reactionary scum!"
korea.48.t:0 "Evicting The Landlords"
korea.48.d:0 "During our time as an occupation zone of Japan many Japanese settlers found themselves in Korea seeking a better life. The Japanese government allowed this to go ahead and sought to propogate the abusive landlord system. The time has come to evict these robber-barons and return the land to those who toil in the fields. Many in our government believe we can use this to also evict the Japanese themselves from the country while others believe we should only evict the landlords and integrate the Japanese."
korea.48.a:0 "They helped perpetuate this rotten system and dominated our people. Be gone with them all!"
korea.48.b:0 "They are victims of oppression too, let them stay!"
korea.49.t:0 "The Militia Issue"
korea.49.d:0 "When we ascended to power, the national army quickly disintegrated and formed warlord cliques that now roam the countryside in search of plunder. To combat this threat peasent militias have risen up to protect their livelihoods. While admirable they are not loyal to socialism but rather their own wealth. As we begin to reform the military it is obvius we will have to deal with these miltias at some point though the question is whether or not to integrate them into our army as is the case with other syndicalist powers or dismantle them."
korea.49.a:0 "Let us follow the example set by our socialist brothers."
korea.49.b:0 "They would just be a burden and a threat to the revolution."
korea.50.t:0 "The Council Of State"
korea.50.d:0 "With the old order swept away and the rotten parliamentary system defeated the coalition government has established 'The Council Of State' which will act as both the executive and legislative body. Sin Chaeho will continue on as the head of state, permanently occupying the position of Chairman of the Council until a time of his choosing. For now though the Council of State will act as a beacon for our syndicalist brothers and sisters."
korea.50.a:0 "One step closer to utopia!"
korea.51.t:0 "True Freedom"
korea.51.d:0 "While Kim Koo claimed to be a 'liberal' he channeled only reactionary forces and his so called 'liberalism' was little more than the gateway to reactionary oppression. But under the socialist coalition true freedom has been achieved. No longer must Koreans fear poverty. No longer must they fear the slave master or the factory owner. Koreans have been liberated from the shackles of economic oppression and march forward as free people!"
korea.51.a:0 "The dream has become reality..."
korea.52.t:0 "The End of the War"
korea.52.d:0 "Korea has been fortunate in that we have been able to liberate ourselves from our Japanese overlords. While we can look proudly into the future, the independence war has destroyed our nation and we struggle with the legacy of the war. Refugees still flood out of the country and those within it live in poor conditions. A campaign of reconstruction must be undertaken if we are to fix the nation."
korea.52.a:0 "Freedom comes at a price"
korea.53.t:0 "The Conscription Question"
korea.53.d:0 "During the war, conscription was a necessary evil implemented by the provisional government to ensure a consistent flow of men for the front. With the war over, many are demanding we reverse the conscription policy. The Supreme War Council has insisted we maintain it in case we are drawn into future conflicts."
korea.53.a:0 "Agree with the SWC, we need to keep it in place"
korea.53.b:0 "Abolish the policy, we don't need it anymore"
korea.54.t:0 "The Refugees Return"
korea.54.d:0 "With the end of the war and promises of relief many refugees are returning to Korea, putting a major burden on the already strained refugee camps. With the influx of people we are suffering from major food shortages and disease with famine likely to set in soon unless we take action."
korea.54.a:0 "Great, more problems"
korea.55.t:0 "Korea wants to join the Sino Military Alliance"
korea.55.d:0 "A diplomatic envoy has arrived from the young nation of Korea. Having recently gained their independence from Japan they are seeking to align themselves on the world stage, most likely as a counter measure to renewed Japanese aggression. While accepting the Koreans into our alliance would allow us to exert some influence over our historic tributary state, it could bring us into a war with Japan."

korea.63.a:0 "Damn"
korea.64.t:0 "Korea In The Internationale?"
korea.64.d:0 "Now that internal revolutionaries have truly liberated Korea, we must decide on what our foreign policy direction should be. Many in the government and especially in the KPP believe that we should seek entry into the Internationale to fight for the world revolution and protect us from Japan. While their arguments are convincing the syndicalists believe that we should instead look internally and focus on building up the strength of the korean syndicates and anarchist communes rather than be drawn into foreign wars. Both arguments are convincing and it is ultimately for the chairman to decide."
korea.64.a:0 "Pack your bags, we're going to Europe!"
korea.64.b:0 "Shut the borders, ground the planes and anchor the ships, we are hermits once more!"
korea.65.t:0 "Korea Wants To Join The Internationale"
korea.65.d:0 "A delegation from the newly established Korean Free Territory has arrived today asking for entrance into the Internationale. This is a great victory for the International Revolution and Korea could act as a springboard into China and Japan though some question how much strategic value they can serve and they could drag us into a conflict with Japan during the inevitable war with Germany."

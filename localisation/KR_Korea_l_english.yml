The Korean Anarchist Federation in China was formed in April 1924. and published the “Korean Revolution Manifesto”. It is militantly anti-imperialist “we declare that the burglar politics of Japan is the enemy for our nation’s existence and that it is our proper right to overthrow the imperialist Japan by a revolutionary means”. It went on to stress the need to do more than merely exchange rulers, pointing out the difference between a political revolution and a social revolution. It had no doubts about the role of anarchists; it laid emphasis on the leading role of the anarchists in a revolutionary situation. The Federation began to produce papers like Recapture and Justice Bulletin. The KAM is now the primary source of Leftist Resistance against Japan.§!"

## Bio ##

POLITICS_KOO_DESC:0 "Towering over both his allies and opponents, Kim Koo is both the political embodiment of what remains of Korean nationalism while also the puppeteer behind countless cases of white terror. Born large, a young Kim Koo enlisted himself into the peasant armies in the Tonghak Movement, and as the Uprising scattered, he was rescued by An Taehoon, the father of the legendary An Junggeun, later assassin of Itō Hirobumi. In 1896 Kim would be arrested for murdering a Japanese merchant, believing him to be a military officer. After escaping, Kim turned away from politics,instead, he worked to establish schools with the help of churches. By 1905, however, outraged by the signing of the Japan-Korea treaty, Kim returned to the nationalist scene, befriending like-minded individuals who would become his comrades.\n\nWith the establishment of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in Shanghai in 1925, Kim became one of its integral members, quickly establishing his position as the backbone of the Provisional Government, whether it be direct or indirect. Within his rise to power, Kim served as both a member of the Korean Provisional Congress and as the Chief of Policing, doing what he could to halt infiltrating traitors. Meanwhile, his activities included multiples assassinations of his comradery, many of whom served as obstacles in his power hoard. By 1923 he was appointed Provisional Interior Minister and in 1926 Prime Minister. In 1930 he established the Korean Independence Party, which became the solidifying element of his rise to power. As the unchallenged leader of the Korean State and Nation, Kim Koo looks forward into the abyss."
Yi_UN_DESC:0 "Born into the family of Joseon royalty as the seventh son of Gojong, the Gwangmu Emperor, Yi Un hardly knew what it was like to be King of Korea. Anointed as Crown Prince in 1907, he was taken at the age of ten to Japan at the initiative of Ito Hibroumi. Here, the Japanese Emperor Meiji took a particular liking and attention to the young Korean prince. The prince grew up with Japanese nobility, such as the princes Hirohito, Takamatsu, and Chichibu. However, after Ito’s assassination in 1909, the Meiji Emperor stopped seeing Yi Un, and the Korean prince became a captive in his adopted country.\n\nFrom 1911-to 1924, Yi Un served in the Japanese Army despite his short stature after enrolling in the Army Central Youth School. From 1927-to 1928, the prince decided to see the world outside Japan and Korea. He thus embarked on a voyage to Europe, visiting the syndicalist capitals of London and Paris and visiting the German and Austrian Empires before returning to Japan in late 1928.\n\nWhen the Second Sino-Japanese War broke out, Yi Un served in the North China Army—where he was captured in the intense fighting along the Sino-Korean border by Qing forces. With the Qing’s support, the Korean Independence Party agreed to acknowledge Yi Un as the rightful heir of Joseon and adopt their government as one akin to their Chinese neighbours - that of a constitutional monarchy. As the new king of the restored House of Yi, Yi Un leads a new and revived Joseon - one that will no doubt echo the triumphs of Korea’s glorious past."
KOR_yi_kang_leader_desc: "Born, in 1877, as the fifth son of Gojong through his concubine Lady Jang, Yi Kang became Prince Uihwa in 1892. Falling into lawsuits and debts after being wedded to Kim Sudeok, the prince became Korea’s special ambassador to Japan in 1895 to partake in the Japanese victory celebrations over the Chinese in the First Sino-Japanese War. Having no issue of his own, he served as an ambassador to European countries and the United States, although his playboy lifestyle and profligate spending antagonized the Korean government. He participated in the Korean Red Cross from 1906 to 1907; however, when his father abdicated, his half-brother Prince Yi Un became crown prince due to his father’s dislike of him.\n\nFollowing Japan’s annexation of Korea in 1910, Yi Kang became increasingly dissatisfied with his status despite being provided with a generous annual allowance. When he heard the news of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea in 1928, he attempted to flee Korea to join the exiles. His escape was a failure, and despite Yi Kang’s efforts to remove his titles, he effectively remained a political prisoner in Seoul. In 1930, he officially retired. Despite all this, his burning desire to see Korea independent never faded; he once remarked that he would rather be a peasant in an independent Korea than a noble under Japanese rule.\n\nWhen troops under the Qing Empire liberated Korea at the end of the Second-Sino Japanese War, Yi Kang was finally able to meet the Provisional Government that had been in exile for so long. To honor the Qing’s historical relationship with Joseon and acknowledge Korea’s new relationship with China, Yi Kang was almost unanimously declared as King of a revived Joseon. He now bears the responsibility of carrying on Joseon’s glorious legacy under the banner of a newly freed Korea."
KOR_pak_hon_yong_leader_desc: "Pak Hon-yong, born illegitimate son to an Yangban father, traveled to Seoul to seek study, and in the process became affiliated with nationalist thought. Forced into exile and a loyalist to a stateless nation, Pak went to foreign shores to find refuge. He settled in Europe, growing ideologically entangled with the rise of Syndicalism in France, Italy, and Britain. Profoundly affected by the revolutions he witnessed, Pak would be one of the first Koreans to be affiliated with the Third Internationale, and returned to Korea as an undercover agent to spread syndicalist ideals to the Japanese occupied peninsula. After a period of imprisonment and illness, Pak miraculously escaped the wrath of the Japanese forces and found his way back to Paris. There he involved himself deeply in the burgeoning Totalist movement, drawing himself close to Mosley and Mussolini's camps and finding common ground with their nationalistic tendencies. By 1931, Pak shuttled between Europe and Shanghai, where he could freely support both the struggle for independence and the struggle for syndicalism, initiating the publication of pro-syndicalist newspapers. The following year Pak condemned the Provisional Government for being too reactionary and excluding socialists thinkers. Having found a similarly minded backer, Pak firmly asserts himself as the champion of Bolshevism in Korea, and the might of red rule has only begun."
KOR_lyuh_woon_hyung_leader_desc: "Not all Korean nationalists affiliated themselves with the Provisional Government, and Lyuh Woon-hyung, once the Foreign Minister for the PGROK, is one of them. As foreign minister, Lyuh often found himself opposing the dominant factions. Lyuh was frequently approached in secret by Japanese officials trying to turn him, all returned bare-handed, if not severely ridiculed. Tiring of the constant factionalization of the PGROK, he sought new contacts in the Third Internationale and the Kuomintang, only to fall out with them as well. After a tour of Southeast Asia fighting along local nationalists against the German colonial presence, Lyuh was eventually captured during a football match in Qingdao, where the German authorities promptly extradited him to Japan. After a short period of imprisonment Lyuh would return to the stage as the head of the Joongang Newspaper Company. He used this time to establish contacts with the various bickering groups in Korea, including his former rivals, building an underground presence hidden from the searchlights of the Japanese. This became known as the Committee for the Preparation of Korean Independence and as its leader Lyuh attempts to seek a unified force of all ideologies within the new Korean state. Under him, Korea shall grow strong, strong enough to weather the waves that it must bear alone. After years of trauma, Korea must not become a satellite or a 'Sister Republic' but instead a fully free and independent democracy!"
KOR_jo_so_ang_desc: "Jo So-ang, alumni of Sungkyunkwan, was selected by the Korean Imperial government t represent his country on an educational trip to Japan. Upon arriving, he encountered immense prejudice against his countrymen, and there began his long struggle to achieve his nation's independence. Jo would enroll into Meiji University as a law student but soon be shocked by the news of the annexation of Korea. After a long period of suffering from anxiety and depression, Jo would travel to Shanghai in an attempt to evade the spying eyes of the Japanese authorities. There, he would cross paths with the Korean officials who would later become the backbone of the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea. Upon finishing his education, he settled in China for good. When the May 30th Movement shook eastern China, Jo quickly traveled to Shanghai, where he would meet up with his comrades and friends, who united together to form the Provisional Government. The year 1928 saw Jo, along with his two comrades, Kim Kyu-sik and Lyuh Woon-hong, arriving in the Shanghai Conference as the delegates of Syngman Rhee. Returning with what would be Rhee’s downfall, Jo took the initiative to meet up with and participate in the KIP. Once the KNRP was established, Jo would again side differently now with Kim Wonbong. Kim, an ardent believer in the three principles of the people, welcomed Jo and his draft of Samgyunism, a Koreanised version of the principles that Kim was willing to accept to distance his party as a mere Kuomintang puppet. Jo now stands independent away from both reactionary bickering and Sinophilic socialists, trying his best to light a beacon of liberalism so his now finally independent motherland may sail soundly against the tide of history."
KOR_chough_pyung_ok_leader_desc: "After the impeachment and exile, then subsequent disappearance of Dr. Syngman Rhee in 1928, a young Chough Pyung-ok would meet many of Rhee's exiled and dispersing subordinates while studying in the United States. Greatly influenced by them and his patriotic father, Chough quickly returned to Korea to ignite independence movements at home. Neither affiliated with the Provisional Government nor the socialist presence, Chough would reunite with his friends of the old Rhee faction and form what would be the roots of the Korean Democratic Party, absorbing liberal elements from the KIP into their ranks. Full of zeal, the small party would attack the socialists and the KIP for their questionable ethics. Struggling, however, Chough and his subordinates eventually turned to deal with the devil, accepting hefty donations and entries from none other than their old enemy, the collaborators. With their money and power, the KDP grew from a small group to a fully-fledged political party but would permanently carry the stain as the party of the traitors."
KOR_kim_wonbong_civilian_desc: "After disassociating himself from the Third Internationale in 1931, Kim would contact his old friends in Whampoa to re-insert himself as an associated officer of the Kuomintang, and later fully integrate himself, along with the remnants of the Heroic Corps, into the Left KMT, who would use his expertise in espionage from his time serving for righteous armies to their use, while he would gain access to further training of Korean cadets. In 1932 Kim organised the Korean National Revolutionary Party, acting as the sister organisation to the KMT within the also widely KMT-associated Korean Provisional Government, and as the opposition to its ruling party, the Korean Independence Party.\n\nA life in exile hardly deterred the patriotic Korean revolutionary Kim Wonbong from seeing the resurrection of a Korean nation in his lifetime. He has emerged as an energetic and passionate leader as shown in his leadership and courage in the National Revolutionary Army during the Second Northern Expedition and the war with Japan. While the road to a socialist and nationalist Korea remains in the future, Wonbong has finally achieved the dream of seeing his country liberated and free in his lifetime."

korea.3.d:0 "While Korea is independent, many factions have different and competing views for the country, especially in terms of how our politics should be made up. This often leads to violent confrontations in the streets and various anarchist societies have conducted a campaign of terror against the civilian populace. On the world stage Korea is recognized by few powers, hampering our ability to conduct trade and foreign affairs. Our Army, the Korean Defense Forces, is a shambolic mess, with its high command lacking any real structure or unified doctrine and our economy is non-existent, only made worse by the lack of trade."
korea.3.a:0 "This doesn't bode well"
korea.4.t:0 "The Occupation"
korea.4.d:0 "Little has really changed since the initial occupation. The country is bound by martial law and soldiers patrol the streets while the doors to the National Assembly remain chained shut. General Hong Sa-ik rules with an iron fist and bows down to our captors. To many Koreans life will go on as before with independence a pipe dream."
korea.4.a:0 "Stability comes at a price"
korea.5.t:0 "The Revolution Reaches Korea"
korea.5.d:0 "It was thought impossible but the revolution has reached Korea! Our international allies have liberated us from both the Japanese slavedrivers and their reactionary lapdogs. Koreans every where will rejoice at this news!"
korea.5.a:0 "Hurray for Internationalism!"
korea.6.t:0 "The Royal Debate"
korea.6.d:0 "Currently a constitutional assembly has been formed and is deciding what path the new Korea should take. Shortly after its establishment, the last Crown Prince of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Un appeared in Seoul flanked by supporters in the Korean Nationalist Party (KNP) calling for a restoration of the monarchy. Practically all parties in the assembly are opposed to the inclusion of monarchist elements but the final choice rests with President Chong.\nHowever more radical elements have made chilling threats. The Anarchists have warned that if the monarchists take their seats they will begin a campaign of terror and the Supreme War Council has said that if a dark day falls on Korea it no longer has confidence in the government's ability."
korea.6.a:0 "The new Korea shall be a republic, there is no need for a debate on the matter"
korea.6.b:0 "What's the worst that could happen? Let them in!"
korea.7.t:0 "The Monarchists Complain!"
korea.7.d:0 "While some more moderate members of the KNP have accepted Korea will be a republic and are prepared to work in the new system, many other members are disatisfied and have radicalized, joining the mysterious "New Privy Council Association" and agitating for civil protest against the new republic. Shall we give in to their demands and them sit in the assembly?"
korea.7.a:0 "Lock the doors of the assembly and arrest anyone who gets violent"
korea.7.b:0 "If they're so desperae just let them in"
korea.8.t:0 "Strange Events"
korea.8.d:0 "Since our u-turn on the monarchist policy strange things have been happening. Telegraph lines cut, railway lines dismantled, guns recovered in dark alleyways and in Pyongyang there have been reports of bomb threats. Similarly strange events have taken place elsewhere; military trains arrive late, or not at all. Monarchist officers disappear without a trace and entire countryside barracks have vanished, brick by brick with only a concrete base left. Something is going on but are intelligence services seem to be useless."
korea.8.a:0 "How strange"
korea.9.t:0 "The Power Struggle"
korea.9.d:0 "It seems that letting the monarchists into the assembly was a horrible idea after all. At midnight last night Kim Koo was returning to the Presidential Palace by car when a horrible explosion rocked the street. His personal bodyguards were shot by masked men who quickly surrounded the area. Though the President managed to escape with his driver there whereabouts are unknown. With the President out of the way the terrorists quickly converged onto the Presidential Palace killing anyone they encountered and declaring over radio the establishment of the Korean Free Territory. \nEnraged, members of the Supreme War Council immediately dispatched the Seoul garrison to shut down the uprising which immediately spilled over to a full blown battle as anarchist supporters were rallied. After contious fighting the dust finally settled and the winner was..."
korea.9.a:0 "The Military!"
korea.9.b:0 "The Anarchists!"
korea.10.t:0 "Monarchists Enter the Assembly"
korea.10.d:0 "Represenatives of the KNP took their seats in the assembley today and immediately caused trouble. The debate was marred by speakers being drowned out, unruly chanting and poor behaviour on both sides. After allegations of the KNP bribing members of the liberal factions emerged, practically all represenatives of the government have abandoned the assembly with the monarchists proclaiming victory. Acting President Kim Koo was offered the title of regent but denied it. Regardless the results are a foregone conclusion."
korea.10.a:0 "Hurrah for King Yi Un and the KNP!"
korea.10.b:0 "What's that noise outside..."
korea.11.t:0 "Massacre In The Assembly!"
korea.11.d:0 "The remaining members of the assembly had sat down to hear the votes cast. With a resounding victory for the monarchists, many began to applaud but this could not drown out the rattling and screams coming from the corridor. Witness reports are sketchy but supposedly a group of armed, masked men stormed the room and began firing randomly at all assembly members. Newspapers are already blaming syndicalist agitators but some think the nobility could be behind this. The NPC's members mysteriously left the chamber by a back room just as the votes were being cast..."
korea.11.a:0 "What?!"
korea.12.t:0 "The Monarchist Coup"
korea.12.d:0 "As gunfire raged through the Assembly building and panicked bureaucrats ran into the streets, another group of armed men stormed the Presidential Palace, overwhelming the guards and breaking into Kim Koo's office. \n'Mr President, you are under arrest.' Before he could respond Kim Koo was arrested and dragged from the building. Monarchists everywhere cheer though there are worried as to how the SWC and Anarchists will react..."
korea.12.a:0 "It is unfortuanate but the King must rule as Heaven sees fit."
korea.12.b:0 "The Supreme War Council arrest the monarchists and stop the plot!"
korea.13.t:0 "The Military Counter-Coup"
korea.13.d:0 "The military have shut down the monarchist conspiracy and liberated Kim Koo from his cell. The people cheer the army as the saviours of the nation and they are expected to return powers back to the civilian government. Though they could remain in power..."
korea.13.a:0 "The Junta is purely transitionary. Restore Kim Koo to the throne!"
korea.13.b:0 "Kim Koo failed. We are not going anywhere."
korea.14.t:0 "Anarchists Attempt A Coup"
korea.14.d:0 "With the military continuing the Junta some of the most fervent opposition has arisen from the anarchists who have committed themselves to tearing down the regime. As the Supreme War Council finished a meeting in the Ministry of Defense masked gunman attempted to storm the compound. Though initially repelled reports of terrorist attacks are coming in from all over the country as military garrisons try to put down the chaos. After the fighting the dust settles and..."
korea.14.a:0 "The Military is victorious!"
korea.14.b:0 "The Anarchists win the fight!"
korea.15.t:0 "The Military Dictatorship"
korea.15.d:0 "Unsurprisingly the military forces associated with the Supreme War Council have come out on top, crushing the anarchist resistance and sending it back underground. The generals are consolidating their power and an anxious population waits to see how they will use their new found power."
korea.15.a:0 "Peace and stability come at a price."
korea.16.t:0 "Red Korea"
korea.16.d:0 "In a shock victory the anarchists have surprisingly won the power struggle and defeated the military forces. Remnants of the old order have scurried into the shadows to organize into a resistance while the new government consolidates its power. Now the United Leftist Front have collapsed and battles have engaged between Kim Il-Sung supporters and the Orthodox Lefist Movement led by the Anarchists..."
korea.16.a:0 "Kim's revisonnism is beaten by the true proletariat!"
korea.16.b:0 "The Anarchists and their cronies are Weak. Kim Il-Sung is our eternal leader!"
korea.17.t:0 "The Anarchist Conspiracy"
korea.17.d:0 "Despite their near destruction in the civil war it seems that the leaders of the illegal leftist organizations to survive have fled North to Fengtian and out of our reach. Through cells in the shadows they agitate for further opposition to the new Korean state. While small and decimated for now, if left unchecked they could become a force to be reckoned with..."
korea.17.a:0 "We must destroy these radicals!"
korea.18.t:0 "The Absolute Korea"
korea.18.d:0 "We have purged the traitorous 'democrats' from the KNP and now the radical NPC wing rules with an iron first. However by coming to power we have alienated huge sections of our society and we must cement our position if our regime is to survive."
korea.18.a:0 "Long live the King!"
korea.19.t:0 "The Constitutional Korea"
korea.19.d:0 "While it is unfortunate that some underhanded methods were necessary to remove the liberals and restore the monarchy, democracy will be maintained and empowered with efforts to reconcile with the liberals. Korea will go forward under the gentle leadership of their benevolent and well loved king."
korea.19.a:0 "Long live the King and democracy!"
korea.20.t:0 "The Republic Survives!"
korea.20.d:0 "Despite the high spirits over the royal debate Korean democracy has survived and we will continue on as a democratic republic under the liberal coalition. Our rule is accepted across Korea and we must not fear the efforts of radicals."
korea.20.a:0 "Hurray for the Republic!"
korea.21.t:0 "The Red Scare"
korea.21.d:0 "In the early hours of the morning in the backroom basement of a bar in the heart of Pyongyang two men with red arm bands moved smuggled arisaka rifles from a crate into various packages. A commotion began outside before the door crashed and a squad of soldiers stormed the room killing the two men and seizing their haul. \nIn the north most of their major leaders crossed the Yulu river arriving on a small jetty to discuss the impending revolution, not yet aware of the crackdown. Just as they moved onto the port gunfire rang out and the leaders were killed. \nAll across the country underground raids have taken place to a stunning success. With anarchism in Korea defeated it will not prove to be a hindrance much more."
korea.21.a:0 "Stop right there anarchist scum!"
korea.22.t:0 "The Liberal Agitators"
korea.22.d:0 "Some of our main opposition have come from the various liberal factions gathered primarily under Kim Koo. Currently their parties are not in a state of de jure legality though still subject to arbitary arrest and imprisonment. Their lobbying continues to be a thorn in our side. The Supreme War Council has decided that the Liberals must be shut down, while some support a civil crackdown others believe a special police, operating from the shadows must also be established to combat future threats."
korea.22.a:0 "Launch a civil crackdown against these traitors!"
korea.22.b:0 "Establish the National Intelligence Service!"
korea.23.t:0 "The Royal Guard"
korea.23.d:0 "One of the reforms put forward by the Privy Council is the establishment of a royal guard. Currently the King and the Privy Council must procure and maintain their bodyguard retinues but the Council has decided that a new royal guard will be established to the protect the king and other notables akin to America's Secret Service. However some more radical members have proposed that the Royal Guard should also act as a special police cracking down an anti-monarchist thought. How should the Council proceed?"
korea.23.a:0 "The council agrees that the Royal Guard will be purely for protection purposes"
korea.23.b:0 "The council decides that the Royal Guard's powers must be extended"
korea.24.t:0 "The Seoul Convention"
korea.24.d:0 "Representatives from across the world have met today for the Seoul Convention. With Korea at the forefront of international peace efforts the new nation has decided to establish its global position as that of a purely neutral arbiter among nations as well as establishing various treaties on international rights."
korea.24.a:0 "We've finally found our place in the world"
korea.25.t:0 "A Diplomatic Mission to Fengtian"
korea.25.d:0 "A team of our diplomats have crossed the Yalu River and are making their way to Mukden to meet the Grand Marshal himself on behalf of the Korean Government to cement better relations with the legitimate Chinese Government."
korea.25.a:0 "A brighter future for everyone!"
korea.26.t:0 "The Recognition of Transamur"
korea.26.d:0 "Today our diplomats in Vladivstok have met representatives of the Transamur Government to sign an official document of recognition. Though locked to the Far Eastern Provinces we acknowledge it is the legitimate government of all the Russias and the sovereign of the Far East."
korea.26.a:0 "One day Moscow will be subservient to Vladivstok"
korea.27.t:0 "The Union Question"
korea.27.d:0 "As we have began to liberalize the economy various trade unions have been established. While many of these are moderate in nature simply agitating for better working conditions and some have official affiliation with the KSP, others belong to the radical syndicalist Workers Liberation Congress of Free Korea, often considered little more than a front for anarchist agitators. We can choose to allow these unions to operate unhindered, leading to increased industrial disputes but healing the political divides or simply ban unions in favour of state controlled ones."
korea.27.a:0 "A free society requires free association. Leave the unions alone"
korea.27.b:0 "These unions could see the destruction of the nation, ban them!"
korea.28.t:0 "The Question of the Japanese Settlers"
korea.28.d:0 "During our time as a colony of Japan many settlers from the Home Islands made their way to Korea in search of a better life and they have control much of our agricultural sector. There continued presence is becoming a point of major contention. We can choose to expel them, angering Japan and leading to a major economic downturn  or we could allow them to remain and integrate them, potentially angering our population."
korea.28.a:0 "Expel the Japanese bandits!"
korea.28.b:0 "They are ordinary people to, let them remain!"
korea.29.t:0 "Land Seizures"
korea.29.d:0 "During our time as a colony of Japan many settlers from the Home Islands made their way to Korea in search of a better life and they have control much of our agricultural sector. There continued presence is becoming a point of major contention. The government is proposing a campaign of land seizures to gain popularity with the people as well as give us an execuse to expel the Japanese from our lands while redistributing it to our own people."
korea.29.a:0 "Get out you bandits!"
korea.30.t:0 "The Destroyer Program"
korea.30.d:0 "The Korean naval forces are still somewhat lacking in their abilities. Foreign naval advisors have proposed the establishment of a brown water navy to patrol rivers and the coastline. The German administration in East Asia has signalled it'd be pleased to sell us some obsolete ships."
korea.30.a:0 "We won't turn down a good deal!"
korea.31.t:0 "Buying A Flagship"
korea.31.d:0 "With most of the navy complete the time has come to purchase a flagship light cruiser to crown our young navy in its protection of Korean shores."
korea.31.a:0 "The navy is complete!"
korea.32.t:0 "The Propaganda Battle"
korea.32.d:0 "It is unfortunate but this is a time of war and some members of the Supreme War Council have proposed a massive propaganda campaign to vilify the Japanese interlopers and stir our people up into action. While some members of the government have expressed worries this could backfire, most members agree a campaign is needed in some form. On the other end of the spectrum, officers affiliated with the radical nationalist 'Young Korea' party have proposed an all-out campaign totally vilifying the Japanese. How should we proceed?"
korea.32.a:0 "Veto the proposal. This could backfire immensely..."
korea.32.b:0 "Carry out the campaign in its current form"
korea.32.c:0 "Agree to the radical proposal. We have been under the Japanese boot for too long!"
korea.33.t:0 "The Emergency Industrialisation Plan"
korea.33.d:0 "Korea is lacking in heavy industry centres and the Supreme War Council has proposed the Emergency Industrialisation Plan which would see the government nationalize various vagulely defined 'facilities' and convert them into munition factories. Many are worried about the vague wording though this has created some interesting proposals on what can be nationalized. How shall we proceed?"
korea.33.a:0 "Only nationalize and convert existing factories and industrial centres."
korea.33.b:0 "Nationalize commercial and recreational facilities too."
korea.33.c:0 "The situation is dire, begin mass conversions of commercial and residential facilities!"
korea.34.t:0 "The Non-Discriminatory Conscription Bill"
korea.34.d:0 "The Non-Discriminatory Conscription Bill has landed on the presidents desk and proposes extending the draft powers of the army, albeit vaguely worded. Practically all members of the government and the SWC agree that the conscription age should be extended while most members of the SWC believe in it going further to all mem serving as well as women being prepared for guerilla warfare. Many lower officers support the vague nature of the bill and believe that it should kept this way so as to allow local officers to press whoever they see fit into service. How should we proceed?"
korea.34.a:0 "Extending the conscription age should be enough."
korea.34.b:0 "Draft all men and begin arming the women."
korea.34.c:0 "Let local officers recruit who they need."
korea.35.t:0 "The Hospital Of Death"
korea.35.d:0 "Our anti-Japanese campaign has been suprisingly effective. Perhaps too effective...The urban centres we can control are being flooded with rural Japanese refugees who initially attempted escape via the Japanese lines. However many of these refugees report that roving bands of militias comprised of radicalized peasents and rogue soldiers guard the lines either turning back the refugees or outright killing them. \nWith these refugees flooding our territories many report of a so called 'Hospital of Death' deep inside the countryside. A few of these refugees claim to be survivors while many others talk of losing injured and sick relatives to these fake good samaritans. The survivors talk of torture and twisted killings within the hospital walls. \nThe story has already spread among the population with many native Koreans coming forward and saying they too are victims of the hospital. Tensions are rising with the angered Japanese and the Koreans as both sides try to claim victimhood and a mass hysteria is spreading with many citizens shunning hospitals in fear of becoming the next victims. \nThe Supreme War Council argue this is little more than a hoax while the government wishes to launch an investigation. Our resources our scarce but if we don't investigate this could cost us on the world stage..."
korea.35.a:0 "Launch the investigation!"
korea.35.b:0 "What childish fantasy"
korea.36.t:0 "Death In the Air"
korea.36.d:0 "It was a cool evening and the wind blew gently across the plains as clouds cleared and the moonlight shined down on the fields. Deep in the countryside a small unit of soldiers watched from their hillside vantage of a lonely but large building. Adorned with red crosses on a white field it was undeniably the hospital the survivors talked about. \nFast as the wind the soldiers encircled the building and quickly divulged on its position storming the building and attacking any poorly equipped guards they encountered and arresting the medical staff, rescuing the patients. After a few hours the operation was a success, the refugees liberated and the doctors arrested. As this gallant effort by our men reaches the international press the mass hysteria at home is calmed and we can put this ugly chapter in our history to rest."
korea.36.a:0 "A happy ending to a grim tale."
korea.37.t:0 "Too Late"
korea.37.d:0 "It was a cool evening and the wind blew gently across the planes as clouds cleared and the moonlight shone down on the fields. Deep in the countryside a small unit of soldiers massed on the hillside plains ready to strike. \nIn the distance black smoke could be seen over the hills and the soldiers rushed to action. Something was wrong. Very wrong. \nWhen they reached the site of the hospital they could make out what appeared to be the building, lit up in flames. Unable to do anything they simply watched as the hospital burned. In the aftermath little remains or evidence could be found. It appeared somebody had tipped them off as to the investigation. While the hospital is confirmed to be destroyed and Japanese refugees can breathe easy, many are angered that the culprits may never be brought to justice and the truth of what happened will never be known."
korea.37.a:0 "I want the head of the rat on my desk!"
korea.38.t:0 "A Hoax"
korea.38.d:0 "It was a cool evening and the wind blew gently across the planes as clouds cleared and the moonlight shone down on the fields. Deep in the countryside a small unit of soldiers watched from their hillside vantage of a lonely but large building. Adorned with red crosses on a white field it was undeniably the hospital the survivors talked about. \nFast as the wind the soldiers began to encircle the building and with a thunderous roar, artillery fire lit up the night and rained down on the hospital. \nWhen the assault ended soldiers stormed the burning ruins and began attack guards and medical staff at random with many patients dying in the chaos. But for now the mission was complete. \nIt didn't take long for the military to catch on. The place attacked was a registered military hospital providing aid to local citizens. As the authorities scrambled to find the survivors they had disappeared in the night. It appears the military were right. \nIt was a hoax all along."
korea.38.a:0 "How could we let this happen...?"
korea.39.t:0 "The Japanese Discovery"
korea.39.d:0 "As they push further into our lines, the Japanese appear to have made a grim discovery: the Hospital of Death. While initially dismissed as little more than propaganda, international war correspondents present have confirmed its existence as well as various disturbing entities within. The IJA allege that the hospital is part of a web of similarly designed institutions and have encouraged Japanese citizens within Korea to escape before they meet their own end. \nAs if the situation wasn't bad enough this final message has sent our people into a major panic as hospitals are burned down, doctors attacked and tensions with the Japanese present has reached a critical point with open fighting. It seems not investigating was a grave mistake."
korea.39.a:0 "Lies! It has to be lies!"
korea.40.t:0 "Protests At The Factories"
korea.40.d:0 "Our incredibly harsh factory conversion policy seems to have angered much of the population. With practically all non-soldiers pressed into the industrial corps, many workers are finding their previous places employment and in some cases, even their homes, have been converted in munitions factories. Agitated by the anarchists, many have thrown down their tools in protest and refuse to go back to work, demanding that the government soften the conversion policy. In response soldiers have opened fire on the protestors who have been dispersed. At least for now."
korea.40.a:0 "It's hard but we must all do our part for the war effort."
korea.41.t:0 "Chaos In The Ranks"
korea.41.d:0 "Our conscription policy has not been well-received. While draft riots were to be expected, reports are coming in of men cutting off their hands to avoid service after a roll-out of the controversial 'rifle' policy in which any candidate capable of holding a rifle has been conscripted. \nSketchy reports have come in from the South about an entire village massacred after tensions reached a boiling point when an elderly man missing his left arm was executed for treason. While the story is likely fictional the damage has already been done and public anger is reaching new levels."
korea.41.a:0 "Just when things couldn't get any worse."
korea.42.t:0 "The Executive Powers Bill"
korea.42.d:0 "With chaos erupting all over our fledgling republic it seems our end is near. In a last desperate attempt the Supreme War Council has proposed the passing of 'The Executive Powers Act'. While the bill itself only seeks to combine the current acts into a single document it has been declared as tyrannical by all those outside of the SWC and the President's personal council. But without the bill our efforts to consolidate power could be undone..."
korea.42.a:0 "Veto the bill. It could backfire badly..."
korea.42.b:0 "Dissolve the provisional parliament and force the bill through."
korea.43.t:0 "Societal Collapse"
korea.43.d:0 "When the announcement that the new bill had passed via force the country exploded into conflict with factions all across the country decrying it as a slip into tyranny. Rather than alleviate the issues of the seperate bills it has only made things worse as soldiers mutiny, factory workers lay down their tools and refugees, Japanese and Korean, make for the seas to find safety. The dream of independence is dead."
korea.43.a:0 "Annyeong Hangug"
korea.44.t:0 "The Japanese Withdrawal"
korea.44.d:0 "In a surprising twist of events the Japanese administration in Seoul has formally announced it will be leaving Korea and establishing a partially independent government under Japanese guidance. While not the total independence many desired it marks a significant victory for the independence supporters and shift in Japanese attitudes to us. May this be the beginning of a brighter future."
korea.44.a:0 "What a pleasent suprise!"
korea.45.t:0 "A Visit From the Emperor"
korea.45.d:0 "In a much anticipated affair Emperor Hirohito of the Japanese Empire has arrived in Seoul to much fanfare for a meeting with delegates from our government and then onto a brief tour of the nation. While some independence activists are boycotting the visit, many of our people are hopeful this is the beginning of a long and fruitful friendship with Japan."
korea.45.a:0 "He's quite the unifying figure!"
korea.46.t:0 "The Two Monarchs"
korea.46.d:0 "King Yi Un has arrived in Tokyo today as part of a state visit to compliment the previous visit by Emperor Hirohito. The Japanese press have lavished much fanfare on our benevolent King and it seems that relations between our two nations are beginning to heal. This will likely be the first of many friendly visits."
korea.46.a:0 "Have a good trip!"
korea.47.t:0 "Restoring Order"
korea.47.d:0 "Our path to rule has been fraught with violence and conflict. It is a necessity that the revolution is bloody. Currently our rule is tenuous and reactionaries seek to quickly counter our revolution. They must be stamped out before they can do any real damage to our fledgling socialist utopia."
korea.47.a:0 "Stop right there reactionary scum!"
korea.48.t:0 "Evicting The Landlords"
korea.48.d:0 "During our time as an occupation zone of Japan many Japanese settlers found themselves in Korea seeking a better life. The Japanese government allowed this to go ahead and sought to propogate the abusive landlord system. The time has come to evict these robber-barons and return the land to those who toil in the fields. Many in our government believe we can use this to also evict the Japanese themselves from the country while others believe we should only evict the landlords and integrate the Japanese."
korea.48.a:0 "They helped perpetuate this rotten system and dominated our people. Be gone with them all!"
korea.48.b:0 "They are victims of oppression too, let them stay!"
korea.49.t:0 "The Militia Issue"
korea.49.d:0 "When we ascended to power, the national army quickly disintegrated and formed warlord cliques that now roam the countryside in search of plunder. To combat this threat peasent militias have risen up to protect their livelihoods. While admirable they are not loyal to socialism but rather their own wealth. As we begin to reform the military it is obvius we will have to deal with these miltias at some point though the question is whether or not to integrate them into our army as is the case with other syndicalist powers or dismantle them."
korea.49.a:0 "Let us follow the example set by our socialist brothers."
korea.49.b:0 "They would just be a burden and a threat to the revolution."
korea.50.t:0 "The Council Of State"
korea.50.d:0 "With the old order swept away and the rotten parliamentary system defeated the coalition government has established 'The Council Of State' which will act as both the executive and legislative body. Sin Chaeho will continue on as the head of state, permanently occupying the position of Chairman of the Council until a time of his choosing. For now though the Council of State will act as a beacon for our syndicalist brothers and sisters."
korea.50.a:0 "One step closer to utopia!"
korea.51.t:0 "True Freedom"
korea.51.d:0 "While Kim Koo claimed to be a 'liberal' he channeled only reactionary forces and his so called 'liberalism' was little more than the gateway to reactionary oppression. But under the socialist coalition true freedom has been achieved. No longer must Koreans fear poverty. No longer must they fear the slave master or the factory owner. Koreans have been liberated from the shackles of economic oppression and march forward as free people!"
korea.51.a:0 "The dream has become reality..."
korea.52.t:0 "The End of the War"
korea.52.d:0 "Korea has been fortunate in that we have been able to liberate ourselves from our Japanese overlords. While we can look proudly into the future, the independence war has destroyed our nation and we struggle with the legacy of the war. Refugees still flood out of the country and those within it live in poor conditions. A campaign of reconstruction must be undertaken if we are to fix the nation."
korea.52.a:0 "Freedom comes at a price"
korea.53.t:0 "The Conscription Question"
korea.53.d:0 "During the war, conscription was a necessary evil implemented by the provisional government to ensure a consistent flow of men for the front. With the war over, many are demanding we reverse the conscription policy. The Supreme War Council has insisted we maintain it in case we are drawn into future conflicts."
korea.53.a:0 "Agree with the SWC, we need to keep it in place"
korea.53.b:0 "Abolish the policy, we don't need it anymore"
korea.54.t:0 "The Refugees Return"
korea.54.d:0 "With the end of the war and promises of relief many refugees are returning to Korea, putting a major burden on the already strained refugee camps. With the influx of people we are suffering from major food shortages and disease with famine likely to set in soon unless we take action."
korea.54.a:0 "Great, more problems"
korea.55.t:0 "Korea wants to join the Sino Military Alliance"
korea.55.d:0 "A diplomatic envoy has arrived from the young nation of Korea. Having recently gained their independence from Japan they are seeking to align themselves on the world stage, most likely as a counter measure to renewed Japanese aggression. While accepting the Koreans into our alliance would allow us to exert some influence over our historic tributary state, it could bring us into a war with Japan."
korea.55.a:0 "We'd be delighted to work with Korea!"
korea.55.b:0 "It's too risky, send them on their way"
korea.56.t:0 "They Accept!"
korea.56.d:0 "Our diplomatic envoy has returned bearing good news, we have formally joined the Chinese military alliance! This should protect us from future entanglements with Japan."
korea.56.a:0 "Hurray!"
korea.57.t:0 "The Refusal"
korea.57.d:0 "Our diplomatic envory has returned bearing bad news. We have been turned down and will have to look elsewhere for allies if we are to fend off the Japanese."

korea.58.t:0 "Korea wants to ally with Russia"
korea.58.d:0 "A diplomatic envoy has arrived from the young nation of Korea. Having recently gained their independence from Japan they are seeking to align themselves on the world stage, most likely as a counter measure to renewed Japanese aggression. While accepting the Koreans into our alliance would allow us to exert some influence in the Far East and act as a counter measure to Japann, it could pull us into a war with the Empire."

korea.59.a:0 "Hurray!"
korea.60.t:0 "The Russians Refuse!"
korea.60.d:0 "Our diplomatic envory has returned bearing bad news. We have been turned down and will have to look elsewhere for allies if we are to fend off the Japanese."
korea.60.a:0 "Damn"
korea.61.t:0 "Korea wants to join the Reichspakt"
korea.61.d:0 "A diplomatic envoy has arrived from the young nation of Korea. Having recently gained their independence from Japan they are seeking to align themselves on the world stage, most likely as a counter measure to renewed Japanese aggression. While accepting the Koreans into our alliance would allow us to expand our sphere of influence in the Far East, it could bring us into a war with Japan."
korea.61.a:0 "Welcome to the Reichspakt!"
korea.61.b:0 "It's too risky, send them on their way"
korea.62.t:0 "They Accept!"
korea.62.d:0 "Our diplomatic envoy has returned bearing good news, we have formally joined the Entente military alliance! This should protect us from future entanglements with Japan."

korea.63.a:0 "Damn"
korea.64.t:0 "Korea In The Internationale?"
korea.64.d:0 "Now that internal revolutionaries have truly liberated Korea, we must decide on what our foreign policy direction should be. Many in the government and especially in the KPP believe that we should seek entry into the Internationale to fight for the world revolution and protect us from Japan. While their arguments are convincing the syndicalists believe that we should instead look internally and focus on building up the strength of the korean syndicates and anarchist communes rather than be drawn into foreign wars. Both arguments are convincing and it is ultimately for the chairman to decide."
korea.64.a:0 "Pack your bags, we're going to Europe!"
korea.64.b:0 "Shut the borders, ground the planes and anchor the ships, we are hermits once more!"
korea.65.t:0 "Korea Wants To Join The Internationale"
korea.65.d:0 "A delegation from the newly established Korean Free Territory has arrived today asking for entrance into the Internationale. This is a great victory for the International Revolution and Korea could act as a springboard into China and Japan though some question how much strategic value they can serve and they could drag us into a conflict with Japan during the inevitable war with Germany."
korea.65.a:0 "Brothers all, welcome them with open arms!"
korea.65.b:0 "Give our apologies and send them on their way."
korea.66.t:0 "They Accept!"

korea.67.d:0 "Our envoy has returned with terrible news, we have been rejected! This is a significant blow for the government and will likely put us in the path of Japan."
korea.67.a:0 "Oh no..."

korea.68.t:0 "The Dream of Korea’s Former Zenith"
korea.68.d:0 "A land once noble, powerful, and proud, Korea has seen better days, for we have languished under the Japanese yoke and foreign boots for decades and it has surely begun to show. However, with our newfound independence and relative stability finally being achieved, perhaps we could take this newfound prosperity beyond our borders to the wider Korean diaspora throughout northeastern China in Fengtian. This region, centered around the north expanse of the old Korean imperial kingdom of Goguryeo is rightful Korean land in the eyes of many, only falling from our grasp thanks to the barbaric Tang Dynasty. Should we march to reclaim these lands in Fengtian and beyond, or should we stay here?"
korea.68.a:0 "We shall stay here in Korea, lest we draw more international ire."
korea.68.b:0 "We march to reclaim the lands of Goguryeo and beyond!"
korea.68.c:0 "We march to reclaim the lands of Goguryeo and the Mandate of Heaven!"

korea.69.t:0 "Sue For Peace"
korea.69.d:0 "Despite the odds, the Korean rebels have managed to defeat the Imperial Japanese army again and again. Our forces are on the ropes, wholly unprepared for the Korean assault. Most of His Majesty's advisors have now come to terms with the reality of Korean independence and urge a reconciliation before the Koreans realize just how close they are to defeating us in its entirety."
korea.69.a:0 "Offer them their Independence."
korea.69.b:0 "Never!"

korea.70.t:0 "Japan Asks for Peace"
korea.70.d:0 "It seems the Japanese are tired of war and have finally come to their senses. Envoys from the Emperor say he is prepared to recognize Japanese independence, as well as make the Peninsula whole again by restoring North Korea to us, and once again opening Korea's access to the rest of Asia. Some in the general staff see this as a sign of weakness; we should press on for a better deal or total capitulation. But others in the government note that the Korean people have no stomach for total war and the consequences for turning down such generous terms will be dire."
korea.70.a:0 "Korea triumphs!"
korea.70.b:0 "We've got them on the ropes!"

korea.71.t:0 "The Korean Peace"
korea.71.d:0 "The Koreans have accepted our terms of surrender. These are dark days in Tokyo. The Japanese Empire has been sundered. Their mainland territories are no more. Korea has finally claimed the independence it has been fighting for since 1905. May they have as many pains dealing with their troublesome minorities as we did!"
korea.71.a:0 "Woe is me!"

kor.1.t:0 "Establishment of Truly Democratic Parties"
kor.1.d:0 "Many Koreans thought that after securing their independence from Japan their land could witness a real change, away from the autocracy of old. Unfortunately for them the authoritarian rule was meaning to stay, this time under the taegeuk instead of the rising sun. The position of the dictatorship would have been cemented if not for the actions of the democratic organizations and their leaders, who successfully sought to bring true representation to the people of Korea. Now with the republic turning to democracy a myriad of various political parties have organized, preparing for the upcoming election."
kor.1.a:0 "Koreans have finally secured genuine freedom"

kor.2.t:0 "Election of [GetYear]"
kor.2.d:0 "The campaign trail in Korea turned out to be more fierce than many have expected, for the number of people galvanized to vote in such a young democracy has exceeded any expectation the government had. While as an open voting system any party had a chance to achieve something only three turned out to be serious contenders for leadership of the nation. The first of them is the Korean Social Party, which aims to bring socially progressive policies to Korea along with moderate nationalization of key industries. The second of them is the Korean Democratic Party, hoping that a turn towards free-market policies and more conservative values will usher in order and prosperity. Lastly, the smallest of the major parties is the Korean Labouring People's Party. While some have called them a socialist organization they themselves vow to uphold the principles of true western-styled social democracy. Who shall win such a contentious election?"
kor.2.b:0 "The Korean Social Party!"
kor.2.c:0 "The Korean Democratic Party!"
kor.2.dem:0 "The Korean Labouring People's Party"

kor.3.t:0 "Head of the Collaboration Government"
kor.3.d:0 "Our Japanese benefactors have established us as an independent state under the control of our armed forces, two main candidates are running for the presidency of the new republic, both generals and proud collaborators with Japan."
kor.3.a:0 "Kim Suk-won!"
kor.3.b:0 "Lee Eung-jun!"

kor.4.t:0 "Head of the Royal Family"
kor.4.d:0 "Yi Un is the current head of the Korean Royal Family, indeed, Prince Yi Kang is not the Crown Prince, even though he was older than his half-brother Prince Imperial Yeong, due to various reasons including the status of his mother. However his supporters push Yi Un from declaring Yi Kang as the righful Emperor now that Korea is free. What shall his answer be?"
kor.4.a:0 "Yi Un is the rightful heir!"
kor.4.b:0 "Let his brother Yi Kang takes his rightful place"

kor.5.t:0 "Who shall lead the Revolutionary Government?"
kor.5.d:0 "We have finally liberated Korea from the imperialists and capitalists who sought to enslave us! Now our Popular Front is no longer needed and a real socialist democracy can take place. An election is being held, the factions are the Anarchists of the KAN, the Korean branch of the Kuomintang, the Syndicalists, few in number but determined, or the Leninists of the KPP, rid of Kim Il-Sung. Who shall lead us?"
kor.5.a:0 "The Anarchists"
kor.5.b:0 "The Kuomintang"
kor.5.c:0 "The Syndicalists"

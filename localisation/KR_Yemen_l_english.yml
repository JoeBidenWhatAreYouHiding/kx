### Leaders ###
POLITICS_YAHYA_HAMID_DESC:0 "From 1934 onwards, Yahya redirected his energies toward internal consolidation of his authority and the creation of a viable central government, answerable to him personally. To this end, he now seeks to establish control over the Yemeni hinterland, establish a modern standing army, and establishing clear rules for succession of hereditary governorships, all while keeping a close eye on the tumultuous political environment in Sana'a itself. With al-Hamid at the helm, Yemen moves into the modern age while maintaining its semi-feudal state of affairs."
POLITICS_ALI_NASSAR_AL-QADARI_DESC:0 "The son of Sheikh Nasser bin Mas'ad. Ali Nasser had a common background. As a Sunni, he took up rebellion against Imam Yahya in 1928 when the Imam has imposed his rule over Aden. Al Nasser then fled the Imam's draft, and joined the rebels. The rebellion saw Ali Nasser tap into his artistic side, waxing poetic about his mission to kill the Imam. To this end, he joined the underground Hait al-Nadial organisation, and through his expressive voice became their leader."
POLITICS_SHABAB_AL-AMR_DESC:0 "Out of Ta'izz, the Numan family could be described as middle class. As a Sunni, Ahmad could not attain a proper education in Muslim science to advance in Yemen. This may have been due to rumors that his family was descended from Yemeni Jews. Instead, Ahmad was educated in western logic at the al Madrassa al Ahliyya. This school eventually played host to Ahmad's reform group Nadi a Islah. The Nadi a Islah saw both the Mutawakkili kingdom and the Ottoman Caliphate as relics that held back Yemen. He formed a program that disguised social reforms behind the terminology of reactionaries. Promoting the Good and Preventing the Bad was allowed his rebellion to sway otherwise conservatives Yemenis. Ultimately, this proclamation for Yemen was to ease change into a country badly divided."

### Events ###

yemen.1.t:0 "The Imamate of Yemen"
yemen.1.d:0 "Following Ottoman Victories in Southern Arabia and victory in the Weltkrieg, along with collapse of the British Empire in 1920, Yemen experienced a large growth in the size of her borders. However with the continued Ottoman governance of the Sunni populations and their extremely lax ruling of the areas under their control the newly enlarged state found itself riddled with unrest. With the Zaydi Shia Imam at the head of state, he seeks to dominate the Yemeni lands, earn his freedom from the Ottomans, and defend what his country had rightfully earned."
yemen.1.a:0 "Greater Yemen must be defended!"

yemen.2.t:0 "Black Monday Ripples Hit Yemen!"
yemen.2.d:0 "After the crash of the German stock markets, the ripples have already washed over both the economically weak Ottomans and the economically young Egypt. What small economy we have in Yemen has been put into decline by the global crisis."
yemen.2.a:0 "We must act soon!"

yemen.3.t:0 "Rebellious Sentiment in Yemen"
yemen.3.d:0 "After the end of the Weltkrieg, and past that, the unrest in Yemen has only been increasing. The poor administration by the Ottomans and the discontent from the authoritarian rule of the Imamate has led to numerous intellectual groups, and over time they have sought refuge in areas out of our control and in more weak Ottoman governed regions. We must now decide how to handle these revolutionaries hiding in our lands."
yemen.3.a:0 "They shall be rooted out!"

yemen.4.t:0 "Rebellious Sentiment in Asir"
yemen.4.d:0 "We have sent loyal troops under the guidance of a few local ministers and one of the Imam's sons into the Province of Asir to hunt for rebels, and find a way to deal with the unrest."
yemen.4.a:0 "They shall be brought to the wall!"
yemen.4.b:0 "Yemen must stand united!"

yemen.5.t:0 "Rebellious Sentiment in Aden"
yemen.5.d:0 "We have sent loyal Troops under the guidance of a few local ministers and one of the Imam's Sons into the Province of Aden to hunt for rebels, and find a way to deal with the unrest."
yemen.5.a:0 "They shall be brought to the wall!"
yemen.5.b:0 "Yemen must stand united!"

yemen.6.t:0 "End of Anarchy"
yemen.6.d:0 "Now that we have sent probing forces across our countryside and there is an air of control. All we can hope is that our actions were enough to preserve internal stability in Yemen."
yemen.6.a:0 "It is time to heal."

yemen.8.t:0 "A Light Hand"
yemen.8.d:0 "Our military ventures into Ottoman held land led us to realise that the true enemy are the occupying Turks, they are at fault for this unrest, and we shall rally the people against them."
yemen.8.a:0 "Down with the Ottomans!"

yemen.9.t:0 "Focused Crackdown"
yemen.9.d:0 "After the first few crackdowns on dissent we have taken a more lax tone in our anti-partisan efforts. This will ensure the people of Yemen do not hate us, and that the wounds we have open can heal sooner."
yemen.9.a:0 "We've shown our hand."

yemen.10.t:0 "A Firm Grip"
yemen.10.d:0 "We have searched high and low for as many people bearing unsavory ideas as we could, some have fled into deeper hiding, however they are politically broken. Blood stains the streets of towns across Yemen."
yemen.10.a:0 "There will be no questioning my rule!"

yemen.11.t:0 "The Kingdom Proclaimed!"
yemen.11.d:0 "In the ashes of the old order in Arabia our free kingdom will rise. We must now deal with the consequences of being without major outside aid. As forces within Yemen begin to stir we must keep aware of the world outside our lands."
yemen.11.a:0 "Three hurrahs for Yemen!"

yemen.14.t:0 "The Rebellion is Crushed"
yemen.14.d:0 "With the rebellion rooted out in its infancy it did not have enough steam to resist the forces of the Imamate, the kingdom is preserved!"
yemen.14.a:0 "We have assured peace and stability."

yemen.16.t:0 "On the Verge of Collapse"
yemen.16.d:0 "With our mercy towards rebel groups within our country while we were under Ottoman rule, the rebels have begun to rise up against our regime! Wishing to end the Imamate and declare the Republic of Yemen, this group could be a risk of our sovereignty. We must crush these upstarts at once!"
yemen.16.a:0 "For the republic!"
yemen.16.b:0 "They must be stopped!"

yemen.17.t:0 "Disorder in the Kingdom"
yemen.17.d:0 "With our mercy towards rebel groups within our country while we were under Ottoman rule, the rebels have begun to rise up against our regime! Wishing to end the Imamate and declare the Republic of Yemen, this group could be a risk of our sovereignty. We must crush these upstarts at once!"
yemen.17.a:0 "The republic shall prevail!"
yemen.17.b:0 "We will break them!"

yemen.18.t:0 "The Rebellion is Crushed"
yemen.18.d:0 "With the hard fought victory against the rebels, they lost all power to resist the forces of the Imamate, the kingdom is preserved!"
yemen.18.a:0 "We have assured peace and stability."

yemen.19.t:0 "The Rebellion is Crushed"
yemen.19.d:0 "With the rebellion rooted out partially in its infancy it was softened up for the forces of the Imamate, the kingdom is preserved!"
yemen.19.a:0 "We have assured peace and stability."

yemen.20.t:0 "The First Election of the New Republic"
yemen.20.d:0 "With the overthrow of the corrupt Imamate, the first ever Yemeni election have been held. The two main factions which have been the ones to overthrow the Imamate, are the Hait al-Nadial and the Shabab Al-Amr. Both parties have put towards great work towards their campaign, and the people all greatly await the results of the election."
yemen.20.a:0 "The Hait al-Nidal will guide us."
yemen.20.b:0 "The Shabab Al-Amr Will give us the change we need!"

yemen.22.t:0 "Yemen Attains Independence"
yemen.22.d:0 "The rebellious vassal state of Yemen in the south of us declared independence from us over 2 months ago. With very limited advances into their territory and fierce resistance, our advisers suggested letting them go, with the majority of the government and the Sultan all agreeing the resources and men lost is not worth it when we have the greater threats of Egypt, Arabia, and [PER.GetNameDef] to worry about."
yemen.22.a:0 "We'll come back, stronger than before."

yemen.23.t:0 "Our Independence Secured"
yemen.23.d:0 "With our revolt against the Ottomans four months ago, the Ottomans obtained very minimal land gains against our newly found kingdom, and the Ottoman government has officially decided to end the war. However with a unified threat gone, the republicans within Yemen have begun to move again. While independence has been obtained, the road ahead will still be a troubled one."
yemen.23.a:0 "We will persevere."

yemen.24.t:0 "Our Presence in Yemen"
yemen.24.d:0 "While Yemen revolted against our rule over four months ago, we have managed to push past their prepared defences and take over the rest of Hejaz. With the Yemeni Imam and people realizing their defeat, they have agreed to surrender on the terms that the Imam gets to remain on the Yemeni throne."
yemen.24.a:0 "Another threat disposed of."

yemen.25.t:0 "Defeat Against the Ottomans"
yemen.25.d:0 "While the kingdom was proclaimed not longer than four months ago, the eternal Ottoman threat has managed to push deep within our lines. With the loss of Azir and the Ottomans encroaching upon our capital, our Imam officially decided to surrender to the Ottomans. The Imam due to this decision has been allowed to stay on the Yemeni throne, but we will most likely have a closer watch on our nation from now on."
yemen.25.a:0 "One day, we'll all be free."

yemen.26.t:0 "Conquest of Arabia"
yemen.26.d:0 "While most assumed our war against Arabia would be a largely fruitless effort, we have not only managed to prevail, but push even further. With the fall of the Arabian capital, we have managed to unify Arabia under our banner. While the process of integration will be a long and drawn-out process, we can now declare ourselves Arabia."
yemen.26.a:0 "Truly a Greater Yemen."

yemen.27.t:0 "Supporting the Rashids"
yemen.27.d:0 "Tensions have been high between Jabal Shammar and Nejd over unification of Arabia, and they have reached a boiling point as of now. With war now declared by Jabal Shammar, lead by the Rashid Dynasty which is directly related to our Rassid Dynasty, we can help them achieve victory over the hated Sauds to the North."
yemen.27.a:0 "Send our brethren support."
yemen.27.b:0 "Our independence comes first."

yemen.28.t:0 "The Rassids Send Support"
yemen.28.d:0 "Our cousin dynasty in Yemen, the Rassids have begun to send us support in toppling Saud's emirate in the south of Arabia. While Yemen is still under Ottoman influence, they have pledged to do whatever they can to support our decisions and ambitions into the future."
yemen.28.a:0 "We'll always have a friend in the south."

yemen.29.t:0 "Dhofar Taken"
yemen.29.d:0 "With our invasion of Oman over the territory of Dhofar a success, we can leave them to their own wits. Of course, there are some within the government which think we should continue the war in order to strengthen our state further, but a drawn out war in Oman is less than desirable when other threats still lie about."
yemen.29.a:0 "We'll be taking Dhofar."
yemen.29.b:0 "We'll be taking Oman!"

yemen.30.t:0 "Dhofar Integrated"
yemen.30.d:0 "With our takeover of Dhofar from Oman not long ago, we have begun to successfully integrate the territory into our country. While the territory is sparsely populated and arid, it is not any less useful to our kingdom than any other part of the Greater Yemeni state. With this, all of Yemen's claims lye within our hands, and we will try to keep them safe."
yemen.30.a:0 "Our dream is complete."

yemen.31.t:0 "Oman Integrated"
yemen.31.d:0 "With our complete takeover of Oman not long ago, we have begun to successfully integrate the Omani lands into our country. While Oman is sparsely populated and arid, we have strategic leverage in the Persian Gulf and the Strait of Hormuz. With this, we will greatly expand Yemen's influence over the Arabian Sea, and possibly the Middle East as a whole."
yemen.31.a:0 "Our dream is complete."

yemen.32.t:0 "Imam Hanged"
yemen.32.d:0 "The former dictator and Imam of Yemen, Yahya al Hamid has been put to death in a public trial today in the name of the Republic. With the hanging comes a destruction of influence from imperial restorationists, as they are left with Ahmad bin Yahya to the throne, who is a less noticeable and inspirational figure than his father. Hopefully this will ensure the Republic remains strong in the face of threats into the future."
yemen.32.a:0 "He got what he deserved."

yemen.33.t:0 "Putting the Sauds to Death"
yemen.33.d:0 "With us managing to calm the situation within Arabia significantly, we can begin to make moves against political opponents. The most obvious was the Saud Dynasty, which ruled over Arabia previously and attempted to put an end to our nation. This morning in a public trial, the entirety of the Saud Dynasty that we captured in the war, including Abdulaziz al Saud, have been put to death."
yemen.33.a:0 "An end to an eternal enemy."

yemen.34.t:0 "Rassids Invited to Arabia"
yemen.34.d:0 "With the death of the Saud Dynasty and Arabia now calmer than ever before, the conditions are right for our cousin dynasty, the Rashids, to partake in the administration of our new Arabia. The Rashids are extremely grateful for this opportunity as they thought their chances of ever ruling Arabia were shattered after their defeat against Nejd, but an enemy of an enemy is a friend."
yemen.34.a:0 "Welcome Home, Dear Friends."

yemen.35.t:0 "The Rebel Remnants"
yemen.35.d:0 "With us managing to withstand the rebel scum earlier, our focus has largely been ignoring the remnants of the rebels and more of consolidating the regime after the civil war, the consolidation of the regime means we can finally finish them off. Yemeni Gendarmes have been sent all throughout Yemen to hunt down the remnants of this Republican scum, with it being mostly successful. The reappearance of Republican movements in Yemen won't be happening anytime soon."
yemen.35.a:0 "Traitors of the state will always be dealt with."

yemen.36.t:0 "Continued Flow of Refugees"
yemen.36.d:0 "As the Ottoman Empire continues to crack down in Hejaz and skirmishes between the Saudis and the Rashids drag on more and more people flock to our borders to seek refuge. This include those who align with the Republican side of Yemeni politics."
yemen.36.a:0 "Hopefully they don't cause trouble..."

yemen.37.t:0 "Black Monday Ripples"
yemen.37.d:0 "Black Monday, while not hitting us as hard as other nations, has indirectly resulted in an increased amount of Anti-Monarchist thought within the country. Republicans while typically concentrated in the north and south of our country, have begun to popup in our capital and other places unseen before. This could set a worrying trend if not handled carefully..."
yemen.37.a:0 "They'll be crushed where they stand."

yemen.38.t:0 "Yemen Requests an Old Ship"
yemen.38.d:0 "Yemen, a nation in Southern Arabia has been attempting to build a navy for months now, with success occurring on rare occasions. In order to help kickstart the project further, Yemen has asked to purchase the 'SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse', which was built at the turn of the century. Considering the decent price Yemen is offering for a ship this old, there is little reason to refuse their request."
yemen.38.a:0 "We'll accept the purchase."
yemen.38.b:0 "We'd rather have the scrap."

yemen.39.t:0 "Germany Provides a Ship"
yemen.39.d:0 "Germany has accepted our purchase of a ship! They have given us the old ship 'SMS Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse', which is hereby being renamed to the 'Yahya Sana'a Aden Arwa' while under our control. This ship will be the starting point of a great Yemeni navy into the future!"
yemen.39.a:0 "Yemen rules the waves!"

yemen.40.t:0 "Germany Refuses the Purchase"
yemen.40.d:0 "Despite our generous offer for such an old ship, Germany has decided to turn down our offer to purchase an old German cruiser. While this doesn't mean the end of a chance for a Yemeni navy in the future, it has served to demoralize Yemeni people who dreamed of sailing the seas in the future."
yemen.40.a:0 "A sad day indeed."

yemen.41.t:0 "[GetYear] General Election"
yemen.41.d:0 "With our liberation over 4 years ago, it is now time for another general election. The parties remain the same as last year, with the Hait al-Nadial and Shabab al-Amr going head to head over the victor. The results are opened, and the winner is..."
yemen.41.a:0 "The Hait al-Nadial!"
yemen.41.b:0 "The Shabab al-Amr!"

yemen.42.t:0 "Peace with the Sauds?"
yemen.42.d:0 "Our war with Saudi Arabia has not been going into our favour, with Asir being lost and the Saudis encroaching on our capital. With our nation's existence in danger, we might need to give up Asir just for the sake of our survival."
yemen.42.a:0 "Offer them Najran and Asir."

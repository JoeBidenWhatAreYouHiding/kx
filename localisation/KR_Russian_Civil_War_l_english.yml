### Events ###
rcw.1.t:0 "Goodbye, Old Lavr"
rcw.1.d:0 "Today, by presidential decree, the supreme commander of the Russian army, an outstanding figure of the white movement, Lavr Kornilov, was dismissed.\n\nKornilov reacted quite sharply to his resignation. Fearing Kornilov's uprising, we can quietly remove him... or leave it alone. Perhaps a compromise option would be to settle him in a state dacha and give certain guarantees, but it is unlikely that Kornilov will silently agree to this..."
rcw.1.a:0 "Let the Cheka remove him silently..."
rcw.1.b:0 "Try to remove him silently..."
rcw.1.e:0 "Ignore him."

rcw.2.t:0 "Sudden Death of General Kornilov"
rcw.2.d:0 "Suddenly, news came about the sudden death of Genaral Kornilov, which immediately attracted media attention due to his recent resignation and the appointment of the pro-government head of the Army. As reported, General Kornilov died as a result of a massive heart attack, in his home, late at night. However, according to eyewitnesses, there was a fuss in the apartment, and a black car of the Nizhny Novgorod plant was standing under the windows.\n\nThe very next day after the news, a fairly large rally gathered in Moscow demanding an investigation into the General's death, and many prominent officers made the same demands. On the one hand, we can officially recognize the death as natural, but we will lose the support of people and only raise even greater doubts. On the other hand, we can falsify the investigation and come to the same result, which will satisfy the needs of the protesters."
rcw.2.a:0 "Well, he was rather old..."
rcw.2.b:0 "Investigation Will Be Held"

rcw.3.t:0 "Kornilov's Death"
rcw.3.d:0 "Lavr Georgiyevich Kornilov, Supreme Commander-in-chief, one of the four officers that led the White Movement against the Bolsheviks during the civil war, passed away last night at his dacha outside Petrograd at the age of 68.  Kornilov has greatly contributed to post-revolutionary Russia's politics. Two weeks of national mourning have been declared as the people prepare for the funeral ceremony."
rcw.3.a:0 "The great helmsman of the Russian nation is no more." 

rcw.4.t:0 "Kornilov Raises An Uprising"
rcw.4.d:0 "Ignoring Kornilov, we were faced with the fact that he managed to get out of the capital and go to the South of Russia, where he began to convene a rather conservative electorate to defend the Motherland from the socialists. Thus, creating essentially a second Volunteer army. He was joined in the majority by other generals who declared loyalty to the former regime and the impossibility of serving the socialist minority. It seems that the situation is heating up and we need to take urgent measures..."
rcw.4.a:0 "That's enough. The government retires."
rcw.4.b:0 "Call for the loyal forces and demand Kornilov's surrender."
rcw.4.c:0 "We shall act more decisively. Proclaim the RSR!"

rcw.5.t:0 "New Elections"
rcw.5.d:0 "The government decided to resign, having lost most of the popular support and now humiliated and almost destroyed. The next election will be held in two months. Critics will say that the ruling party betrayed the masses, but, as the party leaders say, this was done in the name of national stability and in order to avoid war. The generals returned to Headquarters, disbanding the volunteer army."
rcw.5.a:0 "Victory or Loss? That is the question."

rcw.6.t:0 "Kornilov Ignores the Ultimatum!"
rcw.6.d:0 "General Kornilov has ignored the ultimatum we sent and escaped to Volgograd, where he started to build up defences and call for the Russian Volunteer Army to fight against us. Well, he made his choice, now he will regret it."
rcw.6.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.6.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Kornilov's Russia)"

rcw.7.t:0 "The Proclamation of Russian Socialist Republic"
rcw.7.d:0 "The Old Republic is gone. Now only the socialists will decide fate of proletarian masses. The wild Generals, led by Kornilov have decided to play their own game, let us see how they will react now."
rcw.7.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.7.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Kornilov's Russia)"

rcw.8.t:0 "Test the Peasant Marshal"
rcw.8.d:0 "Anton Denikin, nicknamed the Peasant Marshal, actually has nothing in common with the peasants and the proletariat. He conducted one of the most successful campaigns against the Reds during the Civil War, so he definitely should not be trusted. At the same time, his authority is quite high, and perhaps keeping him as head of the General Staff at least for the moment will help us gain time and calm the situation in the army."
rcw.8.a:0 "Let the Cheka remove him silently..."
rcw.8.b:0 "Try to remove him silently..."
rcw.8.c:0 "Leave him be for now."
rcw.8.e:0 "Have him retire."

rcw.9.t:0 "Anton Denikin Dies"
rcw.9.d:0 "A Hero of the Civil War and the informal leader of Russian conservatives, Anton Ivanovich Denikin, died yesterday in his manor. Although never as radical as his counterpart, Baron Wrangel, Denikin's influence throughout Russia was hard to overestimate. A week of national mourning has been declared as the people bade farewell to one of the few true Heroes of Russia."
rcw.9.a:0 "Even the strongest die one day!"

rcw.10.t:0 "Sudden Death of General Denikin"
rcw.10.d:0 "Today, our country has received the terrible news about the sudden death of one of the best sons of the Fatherland, General Denikin. With the coming to power of the Socialist Party, relations between Denikin, as well as other conservative generals, and the government deteriorated significantly. Denikin's sudden death aroused suspicions even among some supporters of the current government, let alone the opposition-minded electorate. Baron Wrangel, one of the closest associates of Kornilov and Denikin, claimed that the murder was covered up by the government and demanded that the government immediately resign and transfer power into the hands of the provisional government, which he will lead."
rcw.10.a:0 "Give in his demands."
rcw.10.b:0 "Who he is to dictate us?"

rcw.11.t:0 "Wrangel Raises An Uprising"
rcw.11.d:0 "Baron Wrangel went to Volgograd, where he was able to raise the conservative-minded population and some generals to declare the creation of a Government of National Salvation. Having accused the current government of dealing with high-ranking generals, he is serious and we need to fight back against him."
rcw.11.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.11.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as Government of National Salvation)"

rcw.12.t:0 "Provisional Military Government"
rcw.12.d:0 "The socialist government was humiliated and agreed to transfer power into the hands of a strong leader, Baron Wrangel. Having headed the provisional government, Wrangel can be sure that now any decision depends on his will."
rcw.12.a:0 "Call for elections in two months."
rcw.12.b:0 "Restore the Romanovs."
rcw.12.c:0 "Found a new royal dynasty."

rcw.13.t:0 "The Retirement of Denikin"
rcw.13.d:0 "Today, the head of the General Staff, Anton Denikin, was dismissed, and a promising pro-socialist general, Alexander Vasilevsky, took his chair. His views have long been the subject of rumors, but now they have been confirmed. Vasilevsky is respected among the generals, and therefore Denikin's resignation was not taken so seriously. Nevertheless, the former head of the General Staff himself announced an attempt to seize power, and no matter how paradoxical it may sound, he said that he intends to lead a popular uprising against the government. His statements violate the laws of our country and we should have arrested him to avoid trouble."
rcw.13.a:0 "Immediately arrest him!"
rcw.13.b:0 "Ignore him."
rcw.13.c:0 "Cheka will deal with him."

rcw.14.t:0 "Denikin Raises An Uprising"
rcw.14.d:0 "Anton Denikin went to Volgograd, where he was able to raise the conservative-minded poulation and some generals to declare the creation of the Second Armed Forces of South Russia. Having accused the current government of trying to establish socialism across Russia, he is serious and we need to fight back against him."
rcw.14.a:0 "Ownards!"
rcw.14.b:0 "Fight for Holy Russia! (Play as South Russia)"

rcw.15.t:0 "White Army. Black Baron"
rcw.15.d:0 "Although formally Baron Wrangel did not hold public posts, he was the vice-president of the ROVS under Kornilov, and after his departure became the head. His activities can be dangerous, and therefore the government proposes to send him to retirement and dissolve the ROVS, as a prohibited military organization, unnecessary in peacetime. A less popular solution would be to leave everything as it is, assuming that there is no threat from Wrangel."
rcw.15.a:0 "Dismantle the ROVS."
rcw.15.b:0 "Ignore him."

rcw.16.t:0 "Calming Down the Army"
rcw.16.d:0 "Now that all the main opponents among the general staff have been eliminated, it seems that we have managed to solve one of the main problems. At the same time, many officers are still rebelling, and we should solve this problem. The following options are available to us to resolve the crisis: to open criminal cases for desertion against those who refuse to follow orders; to raise the salaries of officers and soldiers, hoping that this will bribe them."
rcw.16.a:0 "We shall deal with them as with deserters."
rcw.16.b:0 "Rise up salaries for them."

rcw.17.t:0 "The End of Army Mutiny"
rcw.17.d:0 "We were able to cope with the unrest in the army and our armed forces are slowly starting to return to normal. This is a big victory for the government, and the leading party has dramatically increased its popularity among the population. Despite the fact that the army still does not trust us, at least they have stopped rebelling."
rcw.17.a:0 "Great!"

rcw.18.t:0 "Kornilov Surrenders"
rcw.18.d:0 "Kornilov, to our great happiness, agreed to surrender and submit to the demand of our ultimatum. The general was soon arrested and will soon be tried for attempting to organize a military coup. His stupid act allowed us to accuse the counter-revolutionary and conservative army elite of trying to usurp power and trying to overthrow the legally elected people's government, thus significantly expanding the repressive actions against the generals. The popular support was on our side.\n\nIn addition to General Kornilov, Denikin, Wrangel, Drozdovsky, and Markov, as well as all other generals connected with them in any way, were also purged. All of them were dismissed from their posts, or from the General Staff and arrested.\n\nDespite the fact that many talented generals were subjected to repression, our government is no longer in danger."
rcw.18.a:0 "Victory of the working people!"

rcw.25.a:0 "Onwards!"
rcw.25.b:0 "Germany will save us! (Play as Western Russian Army)"

rcw.26.t:0 "Pro-German Revolt in Pskov"
rcw.26.d:0 "General Bermondt-Avalov and his revived Western Russian Army has revolted in Pskov. We know about Bermondt-Avalov's pro-German views, so our General Staff wonders if we should outright declare war on them or try to sign a non-aggression treaty for now and deal with them later."

rcw.28.d:0 "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government asks if they can intervene into the war on our side, instead they ask for their claims in Vitebsk and Smolensk."

rcw.35.t:0 "Panic In Siberia!"
rcw.35.d:0 "Due to instability in the Western regions of Russia, local Siberian authorities finally had enough courage to proclaim Independent Siberia. Mostly consisting of Oblastniks, the new Siberian government should now deal with internal unrest and probably get ready to fight a two-front war. Nevertheless, their power is too weak and we are still able to restore our control in the region."

rcw.37.d:0 "A couple of hours ago the Karelian insurgent detachments and the 1st Karelian Regiment under the command of general Yrjö Elfvengren have crossed the border with Russia in the region of White Karelia in order to declare independence from Russia. While we have long supported the Karelian rebels with equipment and funds, this particular actions was not agreed upon with our armed forces or government, and our leadership was unaware of these actions. Despite this, the Russian government, alluding to the fact of the separatist coming to White Karelia from Finland, have accused us of violating the international law and our harsh interference in their internal affairs. Our international partners are suggesting that we should restrain ourselves from active intervention in the Russian Civil War. As our already weak relations with Russian government have been finally destroyed, we have several choices what to do. On one hand, we can remain neutral for now and support the Karelian rebels with additional aid and funds. On the other hand, we can finally realize our expansionist plans and directly intervene in the Russian Civil War. There's also a group of diplomats and officers that suggest that we should remain neutral in the conflict and follow the advice of our foreign partners.
rcw.37.a:0 "All of Karelia should become Finnish!"

rcw.37.c:0 "Better not provoke the Russians."

rcw.38.t:0 "White Karelia Uprising!"
rcw.38.d:0 "Trouble came when we weren't expecting it... or rather where we didn't look. Today, we learned that a Finnish officer named Georgy (Yrjö) Elfvengren has proclaimed the Republic of East Karelia in Uhtua, presumably having crossed the border with Finland in the White Karelia region together with a bunch of armed Karelian insurgent detachments. We are not sure if Finland is supportive of these actions, but considering the separatist have 'invaded' our lands from Finland, their government was at least aware. We must immediately act, and while establishing a new front in the marshes and forests of Karelia will be a serious challenge, we can also ignore them for now and attack them when we are stronger. Despite our final choice, the foreign ministry suggests that we should immediately demand concessions from the Finnish government."

### Zhukov Coup New Events ###

rcw.200.t: "Workers' Strike in Petrograd!"
rcw.200.d: "Following the coup d'état orchestrated by the ROVS, with Kornilov assuming the role of interim president, the workers of Petrograd embarked on a strike aimed at the military. The primary objective of this protest was to compel the illegal military regime to resign immediately and relinquish control to the Popular Front, a genuine representative of the Russian people. The initial strike commenced at the Putilov factory, but by midday it had spread to encompass all major industrial establishments in the capital, becoming widespread. The police force proved insufficient to quell the unrest, and on the following day, the strike persisted, with other citizens joining the protest, expressing discontent over the military seizure of power.\n\nThe situation escalated, taking a sharp turn towards radicalization, when the soldiers of the Petrograd garrison aligned themselves with the rebels, receiving support from a number of junior generals who openly sympathized with revolutionary sentiments. Before the insurrection in Petrograd could spread to other regions, it was imperative to nip it in the bud by either severely suppressing it or making concessions to the working class, addressing at least some of their demands that would improve their living conditions, despite the ongoing crisis."
rcw.200.a: "Power to the people!"
rcw.200.b: "We shall deal with the insurgency!"

rcw.201.t: "Leaders of the Protest Evolved"
rcw.201.d: "The protests of the workers in Petrograd have been ongoing for several days now, and while the initial stages of the uprising appeared fragmented and lacking clear leadership, today a coalition known as the Popular Front has emerged, comprising left-wing socialist parties such as the RSDRP and illegal organizations like the Left SRs and Moscow Bolsheviks. This group has announced the establishment of an extraordinary supreme council of workers and peasants, known as the ChVSRK. At the rally, thousands of prominent revolutionaries addressed the crowd, including Maria Spiridonova, whose speech was particularly captivating and charismatic. She passionately argued for the necessity of an immediate revolution and was subsequently nominated as the interim chairman of the ChVSRK.\n\nTo safeguard the revolution, General Yegorov led the formation of a Military Revolutionary Committee, tasked with mobilizing Red Guard detachments, city militias, and assembling a revolutionary army. Many believed that a new civil conflict would only exacerbate the situation, but the momentum of the revolution seemed unstoppable.\n\nThe ChVSRK advocated for the transfer of power to trade unions, peasants' councils, and other revolutionary organizations under the auspices of a Popular Front, effectively dismantling the existing governmental structures. The arrests of former deputies from the right-wing factions of the Senate and State Duma, albeit not all of them, indicate a potential for further escalation. The generals who assumed control have managed to evade capture before they could face arrest. Regardless of the future developments, it is clear that another confrontation is imminent."

rcw.202.t: "The Protest Spreads Among Large Cities"
rcw.202.d: "What began as a strike by Petrograd workers has now evolved into a nationwide uprising. In all major urban centres, particularly in Moscow, particularly the local Bolsheviks under Bukharin, led the way in calling for an immediate general strike. The other large cities in Russia followed suit, with power effectively shifting to elected workers' councils. Trade unions, factory committees and cooperatives all joined in calling for a nationwide strike.\n\nAccording to reports, the ROVS and its leader, the reactionary general Kornilov, had relocated to the southern regions of Russia, establishing an operational headquarters in Volgograd. Despite large demonstrations in the city, and despite the declaration of a strike, news of the revolution's success in major urban centres was broadcast across radio stations now under revolutionary control throughout Russia."
rcw.202.a: "Revolution in Volgograd will succeed."

rcw.203.t: "Homogeneous Socialist Government"
rcw.203.d: "Following the assumption of leadership by the Left SRs, who seized the initiative in the protests, there emerged a clear understanding of the necessity to establish a unified socialist government comprising all socialist parties within Russia. This decision was officially adopted as early as today, with the Extraordinary Supreme Soviet of Workers and Peasants, under the guidance of Maria Spiridonova, announcing the formation of a coalition government comprising representatives from all parties affiliated with the Popular Front, encompassing internationalist Mensheviks and adherents of Bukharin.\n\nMeanwhile, rural areas witnessed the active establishment of peasant soviets that aligned themselves with the Popular Front's agenda. However, there were exceptions in regions where Boris Savinkov had been actively cultivating his support network over the course of the previous decade. These local soviets predominantly comprised his associates and sympathizers, and while they advocated for revolution, their actions were predominantly guided by Savinkov's own decisions.\n\nNow that power in urban and rural areas is under the control of the soviets of workers and peasants, the ChVSRK anticipates the swift subjugation of the remainder of Russia to the working class."
rcw.203.a: "Revolution should go on!"

rcw.2030.t: "Question of the NRPR-Dominated Soviets"
rcw.2030.d: "Unlike other regions, the Chernozem area — Orel, Tambov, and Lipetsk, as well as nearby provinces — saw the influence of peasants’ councils promoting their agenda, specifically the support of Boris Savinkov and the People’s Republican Party. This development could not go unnoticed by the Popular Front, who viewed the NRPR as nothing more than a counterrevolutionary and bourgeois entity.\n\nAt a crucial meeting of the government, the question of banning the NRPR as a counterrevolutionary party and immediately forming peasant councils composed of representatives from the Popular Front arose. The rationale behind this decision was that, without the support of the government, these councils would undoubtedly shift to the other side of the divide, and Savinkov would exploit this opportunity to claim the role of a revolutionary leader."
rcw.2030.a: "We need him on our side now."
rcw.2030.b: "NRPR will never have any mandate in the our government!"

rcw.204.t:0 "Pacification of Tambov"
rcw.204.d:0 "The peasants in Tambov and the surrounding regions are the only ones who refused to recognize the power of the Soviets. In this region, the support of the NRPR is very high, as well as the Green Army of Antonov, who, although he himself was a left SR before, joined Savinkov after the civil war. \n\nWe need to seize power in Tambov, where the socialists are not completely deprived of support and convince the population of the reactionary views of the people's Republicans. If we cannot convince them to join the true force representing the working class, that we will have to fight them already by armed means."
rcw.204.a:0 "We should deal with peasant revolts!"

rcw.205.t:0 "Savinkov Raises Uprising in Tambov"
rcw.205.d:0 "As Kornilov decided to take side of the monarchist officers, Savinkov and his NRPR has left the South Russia and raised a peasant uprising in Tambov and neighbouring regions."

Of those who are able to lead the crowd, so far not a single party has stood up for the workers. \n\nNevertheless, there are several candidates whom Kornilov suspects of becoming protest leaders.\nFirstly, these are some generals who had ties with the Reds during the Civil War or who sympathize with the workers and peasants. The most notable are Aleksandr Yegorov, Boris Shaposhnikov and some others. We can arrest them immediately to ensure that they don't become leaders, however this may not be enough as there are various socialist parties that would like to lead the protest."

rcw.207.d:0 "Having arrested the Red Generals, we have cut the Petrograd workers off the military support. However, there is still something we should concern.\n\nAmong one of Kornilov's main concerns are left-wing Social revolutionaries who have intercepted the workers' agenda and are looking for opportunities to lead the revolution. In addition, they are one of the few parties that openly called for revolution. We can try to arrest the leaders of the Left SRs before they can lead the protest, but for this we will most likely have to turn to the help of Savinkov's combat detachments."

rcw.208.d:0 "An experienced general, Alexander Yegorov, who served on the side of the Bolsheviks during the Civil War, after its end fell under Kerensky's amnesty, and became one of the successful military leaders in the army of the Republic. However, his socialist views, which always questioned his loyalty, were confirmed.\n\nYegorov arrived in Petrograd, where he led revolutionary soldiers and workers and announced the creation of a socialist republic. He was joined by other generals of our army, with socialist views. Now we have to fight with former colleagues for our homeland."

Despite thousands of demonstrations, federal troops brought into the city together with the police and the BO-NPR were able to restore order. The workers had to return to the factories, and the general strike failed."

rcw.210.t:0 "The Protest Spreads Among Large Cities"
rcw.210.d:0 "The example of the Petrograd uprising was followed by other major cities of Russia, in which thousands of workers also held rallies, and in fact chaos reigned in the cities, since neither the police nor the armed forces could cope with the working class, driven by a single energy and force. Trade unions, factory committees, cooperatives - all called for an all-Russian strike and the transfer of power to representatives of the working class.\n\nUnfortunately, the new Russian government led by Kornilov had to go to the south of Russia and organize an operational center in Volgograd, where their support was still quite strong."

rcw.211.t:0 "The Peasants Join the Revolution"

However, now, largely at the instigation of the workers of large industrial Siberian centers, the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets of Siberia, or Centrosibir, has been formed.\n\nIn fact, Centrosibir was recreated by analogy with the first Civil War, by a local activist from the NRA, Boris Shumyatsky. In 1918, Centrosibir fell to the White forces, but now a lot can change, because in a vast territory that is not yet controlled by any White general, the chances of a successful uprising are higher."

While the Combat Squads and the Green Armies have been efficiently eliminating any peasant unrest since then, the population waited for victories. One of those could have been the capture of Moscow, providing the Revolutionary Front with much needed industry and great propaganda source. However, it never happened...\n\nEach day the popularity of the Vozhd's regime was weakening, and the peasant riots were harder to contain. Finally, the unrest became too large to control. The peasants, have started their provocations en-masse, claiming that Savinkov is only a failure, and true Revolution lies in Petrograd and Moscow. Not only the peasants, but some of the military officers have also felt this, quickly denouncing the Vozhd.\n\nSoon, major cities had been seized by the rioters, including [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. Initially, Savinkov went into hiding, but he was rather soon discovered, arrested and quickly shot by a Revolutionary Tribunal of his own creation.

rcw.490.t: "Communist Agitation"
rcw.490.d: "The failure to apprehend and detain the Bolsheviks had already borne bitter fruit. The protracted nature of the civil war and its proximity to Petrograd proved to be a particularly contentious issue among the populace, which naturally became a focal point for Bolshevik propaganda. Spiridonova and the Popular Front, portrayed in leaflets as a gathering of reactionaries, were the primary targets of criticism. The Popular Front was denounced for its \"waning revolutionary ardour\" and its inability to lead the revolutionary proletariat and peasantry towards the triumph of socialism.\n\nThe Communists, seizing upon favourable opportunities and finding allies in some generals, embarked on an active campaign of propaganda among the population, employing illicitly printed pro-Bolshevik newspapers. Some in our government perceive this as a threat, albeit veiled, but most rely on \"socialist free speech\" to allow the \"sensible elements of the revolution\" to point out the errors that will prevent us from sliding into totalitarianism."
rcw.490.a: "Shut down the printing presses of these newspapers immediately!"
rcw.490.b: "That's true freedom of speech, which the bourgeois don't have"

rcw.491.t: "Bolshevization of the Soviets"
rcw.491.d: "According to the data we have at our disposal, the ranks of the Bolshevik supporters are swelling. To be more precise, at present, the Communist Party enjoys a substantial majority in the Mossoviet, as well as in numerous municipal councils throughout the country, including in the Urals region, enabling them to advocate for the interests of their party.\n\nHowever, this is not the crux of the matter: given that the Bolshevik movement is attracting a vast number of ordinary individuals to its fold, Spiridonova has denounced the Bolsheviks as populists, accusing them of aspiring to reinstate the dictatorship of a single party. In response, the RKP proclaimed the \"socialist freedom of expression\", which Spiridonova previously associated with the publication of Communist newspapers, and furthermore, declared that a dictatorship of the Popular Front had effectively been established in the nation, from which the Bolsheviks had been perfidiously excluded.\n\nThe response of the populace proved to be a source of considerable disappointment for the government, as many aligned themselves with the Bolshevik faction, proclaiming the validity of their arguments and advocating for unity in the face of the revolutionary crisis. This attitude among the people precludes the possibility of completely suppressing pro-Bolshevik publications, as it could potentially lead to a coup d'état against the leftist socialist administration, should the situation deteriorate further."
rcw.491.a: "Anyway, things are heating up..."

rcw.492.t: "Revolutionary Committees"
rcw.492.d: "Things are heating up! Now the Bolsheviks have moved into open opposition to our government. Arguing that decentralization is detrimental, the Communists have established Revolutionary Committees in various locations, claiming that these committees will unite the populace and mitigate the negative consequences of decentralization, which they blame on our government. The purpose of these organizations is to mobilize and coordinate the populace from the \"center\" — that is, the Central Committee of the Party — for active guerrilla warfare. Moreover, the Party oversees the work of individuals in service of the frontline, formulating comprehensive production plans.\n\nThe populace embraced this initiative with alacrity, actively participating in the formation of committees. The military brass did not sit idly by, actively endorsing the establishment of centralised cells. However, this development cannot help but raise concerns. Indeed, such organisations inherently imply a blueprint for future actions aimed at overthrowing our government. This has already been pointed out by several prominent figures within the Left SR Party, who call for the cautious dismantling of these committees and their repurposing in line with our objectives."
rcw.492.a: "This will not go unheeded"
SOV_bolsheviks_make_their_move: "Shut Down Revolutionary Committees"

rcw.493.t: "The Committees Repurposed"
rcw.493.d: "The recent threat to our government in the form of the Revolutionary Committees, organized by the Bolsheviks, had practically come to naught. Spiridonova nevertheless realized the gravity of the situation and ordered the gradual repurposing of these organizations under the Left SRs, introducing Left SR commissars in every possible way and decentralizing the Bolshevik Party's sprawling power.\n\nIn response, Zinoviev accused the Left SRs of \"sabotaging the revolution\" and decided to take the risky step of declaring an uprising against the government, unfortunately supported by some generals. However, this initiative was by then groundless, since the few local uprisings, due to the activity of the Left SR commissars, had been crushed, mutinous officers had been captured, and the Bolshevik Party was seriously accused of attempting to usurp power. The people, seeing the danger in the populism of the Communists, quickly came over to the side of our government. This killed any hope of the Bolsheviks taking power, and the Central Committee of the Party fled the country.\n\nHowever, everyone did not manage to slip away. Zinoviev, for example, was caught in the street at night, and Kaganovich, who had so ardently agitated earlier, was dragged out of the Party department by the people themselves and threatened with lynching. All the caught traitors were sentenced to be shot."
rcw.493.a: "The secret hydra of tyranny is defeated!"

rcw.494.t: "Fall of the Bolsheviks"
rcw.494.d: "From a Russia engulfed in civil war, interesting news comes to us! Recently there had been a rift within the Socialist government: the Bolsheviks were criticizing the now ruling Left SRs in every possible way for their weakness. Polemics in the newspapers flared up, and tensions in society rose as the Communists began covertly preparing an uprising against Spiridonova through the organization of revolutionary committees\n\nHowever, the attempt to seize power failed, and the Bolsheviks who failed to flee the country were killed - including party chairman Zinoviev. Left without a top leader, the party fell into discord and effectively disintegrated, although some small associations are still present, and some joining with Bukharin's NSP."
rcw.494.a: "Communism, as well as Lenin's ideas, were long dead."
rcw.494.b: "A great loss for the once pioneering party!"
rcw.494.c: "The usurpers of power could not usurp it a second time..."

rcw.495.t: "The Great Communist Revolution"
rcw.495.d: "It was in vain that the petit-bourgeois SRs disregarded the establishment of revolutionary committees. Having observed the well-organized revolutionary cells, the sagacious Central Committee of the party issued a proclamation on \"The Overthrow of the Accomplices of the Bourgeoisie and Those Responsible for the Collapse of the Front\", urging the committees and their supporters to rebel.\n\nThe ChVSRK and the Popular Front had no time to react, as our valiant fighters swiftly seized control of most cities overnight, including Petrograd. By the following morning, the Popular Front's government has been already arrested, awaiting a public trial. In place of the ChVSRK the Bolshevik announced the creation of the Sovnarkom - the Council of People's Commissars, which assumed full authority, guiding the working class towards a radiant communist future."
rcw.495.a: "Glory to the Revolution!"

rcw.502.t: "Protests Against Bolsheviks"
rcw.502.d: "Recently, the Bolsheviks and sympathetic generals had staged a coup in which the Left SR government was arrested and imprisoned, and the RKP was now at the helm of the revolution. However, not everyone supported this change. Many peasants, remembering the Bolsheviks' treatment of their class, are already rallying in full force, and anarchists are expressing extreme dissatisfaction with the new and, as they say, \"illegitimate\" government. Before the protests become radicalized, we need to calm the population down"
rcw.502.a: "Shut up the anarchist scum, put down the peasants' revolts!"
rcw.502.b: "We need their support."

rcw.503.t: "Compromise With the Protesters"
rcw.503.d: "We were able to stop the growing unrest through skillful Bolshevik orators, small indulgences and veiled threats"
rcw.503.a: "Hooray!"

rcw.504.t: "Mutiny of the Sailors"
rcw.504.d: "Attempts to silence the protesters by force were not completely successful. And while in the villages we managed to disperse the rallying crowd, in Petrograd full-fledged armed clashes with anarchist sailors and the Black Guard began."
rcw.504.a: "To arms! To crush the traitors of the revolution!"

rcw.505.t: "Seizure of the Ports of Petrograd"
rcw.505.d: "At the moment the Anarchists are not organized, and large reinforcements are just sailing in from Kronstadt. What will we do?"
rcw.505.a: "Let's take the defense!"
rcw.505.b: "We will try to storm the ports and bombard the incoming reinforcements from Kronstadt with guns!"

rcw.506.t: "Storming the Winter Palace"
rcw.506.d: "To everyone's surprise, the unorganized anarchists managed to fight back the Red Guard units, keeping them away from the ports. The reinforcements arriving from Kronstadt continued to push our troops towards the Winter Palace, from where the government had already hastily evacuated. Further, the sailors released the arrested Left SRs from the Peter and Paul Fortress and, supported by cruisers, they stormed the Winter Palace. Having knocked our troops out of Petrograd, they took up the defense"
rcw.506.a: "All reserves to Petrograd!"

rcw.507.t: "Failed Offensive"
rcw.507.d: "The reserves that approached Petrograd were never able to break through the defenses, while many people voluntarily joined the ranks of the anarchists. With the help of the occupied telegraph, the rebels sent out a declaration of the \"People's Revolution,\" in which they announced the creation of the \"Committee for the Salvation of the Revolution,\" calling on the people to overthrow the Bolsheviks. Many other cities have already joined the uprising; in the villages, backed by Left SR vigilantes, peasants are taking up arms and shooting our commissars."
rcw.507.a: "This is the end..."

rcw.508.t: "Anarchist Revolution!"
rcw.508.d: "The uprisings that began recently have taken a disastrous turn! Many have risen up against the illegitimate Bolshevik government. The top brass of the RKP, who tried to evacuate, were arrested at the train station by the Black Guard."
rcw.508.a: "Eh, apple..."

rcw.509.t: "Defense of the Peter and Paul Fortress"
rcw.509.d: "Having decided to take up the defense, detachments of the Red Guards settled in the Peter and Paul Fortress, successfully repelling the sailors' attack, disorganizing them. Now we have a choice - to finish off the rebels or not to test our fate and stay in the defense, waiting for reinforcements?"
rcw.509.a: "Attack! Crush them once and for all!"
rcw.509.b: "Wait for reinforcements"

rcw.510.t: "Mutiny Suppressed"
rcw.510.d: "The arriving reinforcements gave us the opportunity to completely dislodge the sailors from Petrograd. The further organized assault on Kronstadt was given to our troops without much difficulty. The mutineers were captured and later shot"
rcw.510.a: "No traitor will escape the punishing sword of the revolution"

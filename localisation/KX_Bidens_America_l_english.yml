### Leader Bios ###
BIDEN_DESC:0 "Born November 20, 1942, Joe Biden has been called many things. Everything from communist to fascist, yet he would never let these insults get to him. This attitude would eventually land him in the seat of President of the United States after wining the 2020 election. However, after three years of doing just as he said he would, disaster struck. A large-scale nuclear exchange occurred in the Middle-East, slowly leading to Earth becoming neigh uninhabitable. Hoping to save the American people from dying out, Biden would order his government to begin construction of machines that were able to travel through space and time, which were completed in a manner of months due to prior experimentation in the Philadelphia Experiment. With the machines completed, the hunt for a new world was on. It would take only a small amount of time to find the perfect world for Biden's schemes. This world was chosen for as of yet unknown reasons. With his world chosen, Biden and his top military and political advisors would walk through the machines, determined to cleanse the world of it's filthy, even if it must be done with nuclear fire. After all, to truly Build Back Better one must have a clean slate..."

POLITICS_UI_BHIODAIN_DESC:0 "Born to American refugees who moved to Ireland in §C||YEAR||§!, Seosamh Uí Bhiodáin represents the Irish spirit through compromise and unyielding commitment to Ireland’s democratic ideals. When he came of age, Uí Bhiodáin joined as a soldier within the an tArm, eventually rising to the rank of Commandant . After his time in the army, Uí Bhiodáin entered the political scene in hopes of diffusing the sectarian strife which plagued his home region of Donegal. Originally elected as an Independent Teachta Dála for Donegal, Uí Bhiodáin embarked on an almost 40 year long campaign to reach Ireland’s highest office, first attempting a run for the Uachtarán’s post in 1990. A long standing independent figure, a freelance Irish Republican who joined the party when they rebounded in the late 90’s. Despite losing consistently in his attempts to secure Ireland’s highest office, Uí Bhiodáin never gave up, and eventually gained Ireland’s highest post in 2020 after securing a shaky coalition deal with Fine Gael. Now in power, Uí Bhiodáin promises to 'Cut the Craic', and will attempt to forge a unified Irish government, bridging the bad blood that has been built up between the various factions of the Oireachtas. Despite drifting far from Sinn Féin’s party line, his compromising attitude has made him a favourite within Ireland’s legislature, who appreciate his efforts to unite the Irish nation on major issues. "
POLITICS_LEO_VARADKAR_DESC:0 "Notable for being both Ireland's first openly gay and half-Indian head of state, Leo Varadkar is a popular representative of Fine Gael and a stanch defender of Ireland's free market economy. Despite holding somewhat open distain for his peers in Sinn Féin, he has shown reluctant willingness to compromise with them for the sake of the Irish nation. However Varadkar is much more willing to work with Fianna Fáil, who in many areas shares similar ideological positions to Fine Gael. "
POLITICS_MICHAEL_MARTIN_DESC:0 "Serving as leader of Fianna Fáil since 2011, Micheál Martin has become the first member of the party to hold the Uachtarán's post since the party's near decimation; and hopefully not that last. Before coming to lead the party, Martin served as a Cabinet minister in many different posts, notably pushing forward a ban on tobacco smoking in all Irish workplaces when he was Minister for Health and Children, making Ireland the first country in the world to introduce a full workplace smoking ban. "
POLITICS_MARY_LOU_MCDONALD_DESC:0 "Ireland's first female Head of State, Mary Lou McDonald has inherited quite a mess ever since the resignation of her predecessor. Previously serving as Tánaiste, McDonald has vows to serve the Irish nation, and work with the other parties in the Dáil to solve the issues in that plauge the north, and help lead Ireland to a brighter future. If she can hold on to the unprecedented gains made by Sinn Féin under Uí Bhiodáin remains to be seen. "

The invaders, seemingly using weapons and vehicles from the future, came suddenly and without explanation. Arriving in massive pyramid like structures that appeared out of thin air, the invaders kill and killed out without regard for race, age or gender and without reason. That was until a short time ago. Following a massive power spike, a transmission that could be heard on every radio on earth played.\n 'People of Earth, People of America. You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. I know all about you. You are the citizens of the Kaiserreich, you are the people of America. You are the rich, sitting in your Canadian mansions. You are the poor, governing yourselves in the Commune of France. Who am I? I am Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, President of the United States and Chairman of the American Preservation and Colonization Committee. We come from the future, and we are here to reclaim what is rightful ours. The year 2023 has made the Earth nearly uninhabitable following a large-scale nuclear exchange in the Middle-East.

With this Earth now tamed, the time has come to begin Phase Two of the APCC's three phase plan to save the American race. Phase Two simply put will completely transform this planet from a smoldering, radiation, soaked hellhole into an untapped virgin wilderness.\n\n Making use of the various Time Machines that are dotted across the globe, the APCC's scientists have figured out a way to repopulate the Earth's wildlife using plants and animals from other timelines. However in order to successfully do this, all life on Earth must be wiped out due to how sensitive the process is. Due to the need to wipe out all life, this process has never been attempted in the present due to the massive risk factor. APCC scientists believe that this process should take no more then 200 years, which due to time travel, will take no time at all. As an insruacne policy on the off chance one of the machines breakdown, or is importing the wrong kind of wildlife, the process is set to shutdown for a two month period every 25 years, to allow the APCC to keep tabs on the situation, which should take no more then an afternoon.\n\nDue to an unfortunate quirk in the terraforming process, one person is required to stay behind and active it. With the first wave being a massive life-destroying ray, the person who stays behind would be sacrificing their life. While all manner of ways to pick the person who would stay behind were thought up, everything from drawing straws to casting lots, one man, former Vermont Senator turned close-confident to Joe Biden, Bernard Sanders has offered to stay behind. Once a rival of Chairman Biden, Sanders' sacrifice shall mark him as a true American Hero. Sanders has prepared for this day all his life, now all he needs to do is press the button, and the American people can live again..."

As the Chairman so rightly put it, all Bidens regardless of universe seem to have the same driving force, to create a better home for their children. With this driving force, we have been able to crush the enemies of true humanity faster then ever, proving that Chairman Joe, from any timeline, is the only hope for our salvation.\n\nHowever with this successful comes problems, as it always does. While indeed every Biden shares that same drive, they share it for a different group of their children. Be it the Catholic faithful around the world or the citizens of an Ancient Egyptian colonized America, the Bidens fight for their own, not solely for the future of the True America. To solve this, Chairman Biden(now also going by Supreme or Alpha Biden) called a meetings of all the various Bidens who have agreed to work with the APCC.\n\nIn the meeting, the Chairman proposed that each of the Biden's and their respective followers and nations could get a slice of the New Earth once terraforming is complete. Further, he proposed the creation of a 'Biden Council' to act as both an advisory board to the APCC as well a the future head of government, in order to avoid future conflict and warfare. While a bit shocking to some, all Bidens agreed at once, and further negotiations for which Biden will get what section of the Earth has been set to take place within the next few months. With this deal complete, Chairman Biden has once more shown the brilliance of his mind, further proving his claim to be the sole savior of America."

I say, I am Biden, I am Supreme." \n\n After Biden finished, the aide took this statement as a yes before leaving to retrieve a scoop of Ice Cream from the Chairman's personal reserves. Chairman Biden stayed on the hill however, watching the soldiers storm the last vestiges of tyrannical control , watching them collapse as soldiers storm the White House.

Viewing him as perhaps a trophy, Chairman Biden did not order his death, allowing him to preside over the funeral of MacArthur, perhaps out of some kind of pity for the most hated man in America. Following a short service, Hoover would stand and give the following speech.\n\nFriends, Washingtonians, countrymen, lend me your ears;I come to bury MacArthur, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with MacArthur. The noble Biden Hath told you MacArthur was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath MacArthur answer’d it.Here, under leave of Biden and the rest–For Biden is an honourable man;So are they all, all honourable men–Come I to speak in MacArthur's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:But Biden says he was ambitious;And Biden is an honourable man.He hath brought many nations to their kneesWhose reparations did the general coffers fill:Did this in MacArthur seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, MacArthur hath wept: Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Biden says he was ambitious;And Biden is an honourable man. You all did see that on the Capital Building I thrice presented him a position on the cabinet, Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition? Yet Biden says he was ambitious; And, sure, he is an honourable man. I speak not to disprove what Biden spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause: What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with MacArthur, And I must pause till it come back to me.\n\nFollowing this speech, Hoover prodcued a knife and proceeded to stap and kill whom he thought was Chairman Biden, but was in fact a Roman Biden from another Universe. Following this, Hoover was gunned down on the spot. While Hoover's death may be unforunate, it also serves as a powerful reminder that only True Americans are fit to live on Earth, and all others must be purged for the good of all mankind."

Despite that, it has not stopped the forces loyal to the false United States to dig in and fight like hell.\n\nMost notable in the siege of DC was the last stand of General Douglass MacArthur. MacArthur, always the brave soul, unlike the vast majority of the United States High command did not retreat and instead stuck with his men until the very end. As his men fell one by one, MacArthur would lead one last charge in the hope of giving those who were evacuating time to escape. As his men arrived at Bidenist lines, much to their shock, they were able to bring down several soilders. With little time to spare, MacArthur ordered his men to equip the APCC's equipment, while he was figuring out how to get into a APCC Model A67V32 Armoured Infantry Suit. Within the AIS, MacArthur was able to bring down many a brave soilder, until a squad was able to deploy an EMP and fire at MacArthur inside the AIS, bringing him down.\n\nWhile a bloody battle, the Battle of DC was an overwhelming victory and the insights gained from the battle will be most useful to the APCC's battle AI."

Regardless of when Biden's parents showed up, this baffling temporal paradox has made it impossible to snuff out the ancestral source of our most stubborn resistance leader, ensuring the worst fears of the APCC will continue to come true."

With this sudden change in enemy,   many former Keyan colonial army officer have joined the Mau-Mau's ranks, chief among them one Mad Jack Churchill, famed war hero and sword barer.\n\nWhile this is a bit of a setback, it has not stopped Obama from carrying out Biden's plan. Under the cover of darkness, Obama and a small but highly trained team was teleported straight into the headquarters of the Mau-Mau, where he confronted his grandfather. What was said between the two is unknown, however a large chunk of the original Mau-Mau forces have indeed sided with Obama, seeing him as fulfillment of prophecy. With this split in ranks, a small civil war within the Mau-Mau has begun, and Obama is making use of the chaos. Already reports of drone strikes with a reported accuracy of 90% have taken place. Most impressive of those killed by drone strike has been Herman Goring, with his death causing chaos within the Mittelafrikan administration.

Dalian, itself a major port and site of ABPSH reinforcement, had become the de facto headquarters of the ABPSH in eastern Asia. This was so much the case that Emperor Hirohito of Japan, General Falkenhausen of the A.O.G and seemingly a resurrected Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had made Dalian their home.\n\nAs our own armies approched the city, we expected some kind of a fight, afterall it was the largest ABPSH center in Asia. However we could not have expected the amount of fire we would meet. Using captured weapons, some which appeared to have been reverse engineered, ABPSH forces were able to keep us some 30 miles outside of the city. While our aircraft were indeed able to punch into their airspace, more often then not, they would get shot down. This stalemate, the first and more then likely last of it's kind in our campaign, was unbreakable in all but one manner. Unlike APCC forces, the resistors lack the ability to recharge their weaponry, thus meaning we could starve them out, which is exactly what we did.\n\nUp until last night, both sides of the siege had done little more then exchange a little gunfire here and there. However, seemingly as they were running out of juice, the defenders of Dalian made one final desperate charge in a suicidal hope of breaking the stalemate. At the head of this charge was none other then Emperor Hirohito, followed close behind by General Falkenhausen and Generalissimo Chiang. The charge ended as quickly as it began, not even making it too our lines. While the heroics of the charge cannot be deined, with the deaths of the ABPSH's most major figures in the east, it will not be long until Phase One is finally completed, and we can begin colonization in ernest."

Did they come in peace? They did not... Our kindness and concern was repaid with hellfire and bullets. And at the helm of this otherworldly invasion, was none other than the President’s alternate universe doppelganger. As it became clear that we couldn’t save ourselves, the President mulled over a final option; one that would take the invaders down to hell with us.\n\n “Do you think it was the Chinese who started the Nuclear War, one of America’s most gracious allies? Or the Soviets, which had been split between us and China after the Sino-Soviet war in the 90’s?\n\n No, it was us who fired the first shot, we may have doomed ourselves, but we gave them hell” \n\n His World was destroyed in nuclear hellfire, but before the final soul perished in the fires, President Biden, along with the best and bravest American citizens stormed the pyramids and took off to a new universe. Ever since, Biden and the APCC have been searching, searching along with countless others who have been cursed with the same affliction for a new home to house the remaining ‘True Americans’. Their cruelty is not held within their genes, as we can now see that they are simply victims of circumstance, inflicting on various universes the same fate that had befallen their own worlds; after all, by this point it's all they knew. The tragic tale of our fallen invaders could elicit a sense of pity, despite how barbaric our foes may be. Even if their suffering could never justify their heinous acts, we can reflect on their vicious cycle of violence.\n\n “Do you know why I'm Biden Alpha Jack? It's because I did what no other Biden could, I prevented them from taking Earth. I took them out, and while many may not have lived to tell the tale, preventing those sons of bitches from exterminating our planet by destroying it ourselves is the closest anyone has ever come to defeating a Bidenist invasion”.\n\n Biden paused to let out a hearty chuckle before finishing."

The machines also seem to have built in trackers, so that it is possible to stay in connection with the rest of the APCC network. Due to this, chasing down the remnants of the APCC that escaped into the vastness of Creation is suddenly a viable course of action.\n\nPerhaps due to some kind of quirk in APCC systems or maybe because of our lack of full understanding of APCC tech, one is not possible without the other. It is impossible to simply return this world to January 1st, 1936 without us leaving at the same time, and attempting to just leave would trigger the APCC's 'Phase Two,' which would mean an end to all life in this Universe. Thus, if we truly wish to carry on hunting down the APCC to protect the universe, we must also return this world to an era before our arrival. While this would be a noble quest, this reset would also wipe away all memory of the struggle, meaning that old bias and rivalries would return, something that would almost inevitably lead to a second Great War. This being the case, perhaps it would be better to simply ignore the machines, and settle in and help rebuild this new world. After all, Earth has gotten used to it's visitors from the future, and having helped save it, most are happy to have us stay. Not wishing to make such a large decision on their own, [root.getleader] has called for a national referendum with a simple question, should we stay or should we go? "

BDN_Michael_D_Higgins_hog_sde_desc:0 "The Taoiseach of Ireland since 2011, Michael D. Higgins belongs to the Labourist faction of Sinn Féin; a former TD, Higgins served as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht from 1993 to 1997, before launching a leadership bid to bring Sinn Féin back to the line espoused by the former Labour Party before being elected Taoiseach. A strong supporter of anti-sectarianism and anti-racism, Higgins has proven to be a popular figurehead for the Irish people, who almost universally approve of his work. In addition to being Ireland's head of government, Higgins is also a renowned Irish-language writer, and is known for his Burmese Mountain Dogs, who often appear alongside him. "

While not politically active, unlike his Totalist firebrand grandfather, O'Bama serves diligently as a sworn defender of Hibernia, no matter if their government is comprised of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, or Sinn Féin. While some of his comments have been cause for controversy, mostly ones in relation to his late grandfather, who himself praised Ireland as a 'Haven of Resistance to Syndicalist Neo-Imperialism', O'Bama has thoroughly engrained himself within Ireland and Irish Culture while still maintaing his own Kikuyu identity; just as his Irish ancestors before him.

##Fun fact for you file dwelling person, due to Joe Biden's time traveling, multiverse traversing hijinks, every single path in KX is canon. Due to the multiverse, and the fact that only THIS world at the time of playing was chosen, other worlds must exist, therefore every path is canon. This means nothing, but I thought it was a cool fact. -AmCath

### Leader Bios ###
BIDEN_DESC:0 "Born November 20, 1942, Joe Biden has been called many things. Everything from communist to fascist, yet he would never let these insults get to him. This attitude would eventually land him in the seat of President of the United States after wining the 2020 election. However, after three years of doing just as he said he would, disaster struck. A large-scale nuclear exchange occurred in the Middle-East, slowly leading to Earth becoming neigh uninhabitable. Hoping to save the American people from dying out, Biden would order his government to begin construction of machines that were able to travel through space and time, which were completed in a manner of months due to prior experimentation in the Philadelphia Experiment. With the machines completed, the hunt for a new world was on. It would take only a small amount of time to find the perfect world for Biden's schemes. This world was chosen for as of yet unknown reasons. With his world chosen, Biden and his top military and political advisors would walk through the machines, determined to cleanse the world of it's filthy, even if it must be done with nuclear fire. After all, to truly Build Back Better one must have a clean slate..."

biden.1.t:0 "The Invasion from the Future"
biden.1.d:0 "Over the past several hours all throughout the Continental United States,  short and bloody battles have taken place. The invaders, seemingly using weapons and vehicles from the future, came suddenly and without explanation. Arriving in massive pyramid like structures that appeared out of thin air, the invaders kill and killed out without regard for race, age or gender and without reason. That was until a short time ago. Following a massive power spike, a transmission that could be heard on every radio on earth played.\n 'People of Earth, People of America. You don't know who I am, but I know who you are. I know all about you. You are the citizens of the Kasierreich, you are the people of America. You are the rich, sitting in your Canadian mansions. You are the poor, governing yourselves in the Commune of France. Who am I? I am Joseph Robinette Biden Jr, President of the United States and Chairman of the American Preservation and Colonization Committee. We come from the future, and we are here to reclaim what is rightful ours. The year 2023 has made the Earth nearly uninhabitable following a large-scale nuclear exchange in the Middle-East. Hoping to persevere our people, I instructed my government to find us a new home, and your world, at this time has been chosen to be our new home. Die in peace, knowing your deaths will be providing a home for all Americans, and that's No Malarkey'"

biden.2.t:0 "A Final Good Deed"
biden.2.d:0 "After what feels like an eternity of warfare despite only arriving a short time ago, the armies of the American Preservation and Colonization Committee have triumphed, and this version of Earth has fallen under Biden's total control. With this Earth now tamed, the time has come to begin Phase Two of the APCC's three phase plan to save the American race. Phase Two simply put will completely transform this planet from a smoldering, radiation, soaked hellhole into an untapped virgin wilderness.\n\n Making use of the various Time Machines that are dotted across the globe, the APCC's scientists have figured out a way to repopulate the Earth's wildlife using plants and animals from other timelines. However in order to successfully do this, all life on Earth must be wiped out due to how sensitive the process is. Due to the need to wipe out all life, this process has never been attempted in the present due to the massive risk factor. APCC scientists believe that this process should take no more then 200 years, which due to time travel, will take no time at all. As an insruacne policy on the off chance one of the machines breakdown, or is importing the wrong kind of wildlife, the process is set to shutdown for a two month period every 25 years, to allow the APCC to keep tabs on the situation, which should take no more then an afternoon.\n\nDue to an unfortunate quirk in the terraforming process, one person is required to stay behind and active it. With the first wave being a massive life-destroying ray, the person who stays behind would be sacrificing their life. While all manner of ways to pick the person who would stay behind were thought up, everything from drawing straws to casting lots, one man, former Vermont Senator turned close-confident to Joe Biden, Bernard Sanders has offered to stay behind. Once a rival of Chairman Biden, Sanders' sacrifice shall mark him as a true American Hero. Sanders has prepared for this day all his life, now all he needs to do is press the button, and the American people can live again..."

biden.3.t:0 "The Treaty of Dover"
biden.3.d:0 "As Chairman Biden and the APCC beside him work to prepare the Earth for her rightful masters, we have begun to use our multiverse travailing technologies to recruit Joe Bidens from other universes and timelines. As the Chairman so rightly put it, all Bidens regardless of universe seem to have the same driving force, to create a better home for their children. With this driving force, we have been able to crush the enemies of true humanity faster then ever, proving that Chairman Joe, from any timeline, is the only hope for our salvation.\n\nHowever with this successful comes problems, as it always does. While indeed every Biden shares that same drive, they share it for a different group of their children. Be it the Catholic faithful around the world or the citizens of an Ancient Egyptian colonized America, the Bidens fight for their own, not solely for the future of the True America. To solve this, Chairman Biden(now also going by Supreme or Alpha Biden) called a meetings of all the various Bidens who have agreed to work with the APCC.\n\nIn the meeting, the Chairman proposed that each of the Biden's and their respective followers and nations could get a slice of the New Earth once terraforming is complete. Further, he proposed the creation of a 'Biden Council' to act as both an advisory board to the APCC as well a the future head of government, in order to avoid future conflict and warfare. While a bit shocking to some, all Bidens agreed at once, and further negotiations for which Biden will get what section of the Earth has been set to take place within the next few months. With this deal complete, Chairman Biden has once more shown the brilliance of his mind, further proving his claim to be the sole savior of America."
biden.3.a:0 "A Toast to our fellow Bidenists!"

biden.4.t:0 "Washington Falls"
biden.4.d:0 "As Chairman Biden stood on a hillside overlooking the smoldering capital, he was interrupted by an aide who asked him if he needed any cool refreshments in the warm Maryland weather. Before he could finish his question however, Biden turned to him and began to speak. "My enemies are many, My equals are none. In the shade of Industrial smog, they said Delaware could never be conquered. In the land of Presidents and Tyrants, they said Washington could never be humbled. In the realm of Deserts and Canyons, they said the West could never be tamed. Now they say nothing. They fear me; like a force of nature, a dealer in thunder and death. I say, I am Biden, I am Supreme." \n\n After Biden finished, the aide took this statement as a yes before leaving to retrieve a scoop of Ice Cream from the Chairman's personal reserves. Chairman Biden stayed on the hill however, watching the soldiers storm the last vestiges of tyrannical control , watching them collapse as soldiers storm the White House. Washington was in his hands, the feeble government of this version of America was to be wiped out. Resistance from the unclean, impure creatures of this world is nothing but futile. "

biden.5.t:0 "Hoover's last speech"
biden.5.d:0 "Following the fall of DC and MacArthur's last stand, Hebert Hoover. 30th president of the United States, has been captured by Bidenist forces. Viewing him as perhaps a trophy, Chairman Biden did not order his death, allowing him to preside over the funeral of MacArthur, perhaps out of some kind of pity for the most hated man in America. Following a short service, Hoover would stand and give the following speech.\n\nFriends, Washingtonians, countrymen, lend me your ears;I come to bury MacArthur, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with MacArthur. The noble Biden Hath told you MacArthur was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath MacArthur answer’d it.Here, under leave of Biden and the rest–For Biden is an honourable man;So are they all, all honourable men–Come I to speak in MacArthur's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:But Biden says he was ambitious;And Biden is an honourable man.He hath brought many nations to their kneesWhose reparations did the general coffers fill:Did this in MacArthur seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, MacArthur hath wept: Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Biden says he was ambitious;And Biden is an honourable man. You all did see that on the Capital Building I thrice presented him a position on the cabinet, Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition? Yet Biden says he was ambitious; And, sure, he is an honourable man. I speak not to disprove what Biden spoke, But here I am to speak what I do know. You all did love him once, not without cause: What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him? O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts, And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with MacArthur, And I must pause till it come back to me.\n\nFollowing this speech, Hoover prodcued a knife and proceeded to stap and kill whom he thought was Chairman Biden, but was in fact a Roman Biden from another Universe. Following this, Hoover was gunned down on the spot. While Hoover's death may be unforunate, it also serves as a powerful reminder that only True Americans are fit to live on Earth, and all others must be purged for the good of all mankind."

biden.6.t:0 "MacArthur's Last Stand"
biden.6.d:0 "As the forces of Chariman Joe march ever forward towards the reclamation of Earth for True Humanity, the time for reclaiming the seat of Biden's power has come at last.  While DC may be the capital of the United States,  it is lacks a significant miltary presence, and with the Chairman's sudden appearance, that presence is even smaller. Despite that, it has not stopped the forces loyal to the false United States to dig in and fight like hell.\n\nMost notable in the siege of DC was the last stand of General Douglass MacArthur. MacArthur, always the brave soul, unlike the vast majority of the United States High command did not retreat and instead stuck with his men until the very end. As his men fell one by one, MacArthur would lead one last charge in the hope of giving those who were evacuating time to escape. As his men arrived at Bidenist lines, much to their shock, they were able to bring down several soilders. With little time to spare, MacArthur ordered his men to equip the APCC's equipment, while he was figuring out how to get into a APCC Model A67V32 Armoured Infantry Suit. Within the AIS, MacArthur was able to bring down many a brave soilder, until a squad was able to deploy an EMP and fire at MacArthur inside the AIS, bringing him down.\n\nWhile a bloody battle, the Battle of DC was an overwhelming victory and the insights gained from the battle will be most useful to the APCC's battle AI."

biden.7.d:0 "It has been established that this world is impure, unclean, tainted by inferior creatures. It must be cleansed so the generation of pure Americans can inhabit it. The population of this world must be cleansed; however, this has proven somewhat difficult due to the similarities of this world to our own. \n\n This timeline has several similarities with our own, and some of the alternate descendants of high-ranking figures still exist in this timeline. Notably, it has been identified that Joe Biden’s doppelganger family exists in this timeline. While this timeline’s Joseph Robbinete Biden Jr. has not yet been born, his alternate universe parents still exist.\n\n President Biden can take no chances, letting an alternate version of Biden Alpha fall into the wrong hand could prove disastrous. Thus, this alternate Biden must be eliminated to secure this timeline, and the APCC.\n\n At dawn Bidenist forces have rounded up Joseph Robinette Biden Sr and Catherine E. F. Biden, and promptly executed them. This action has prevented this timeline’s Joe Biden from ever existing, preventing an impure Biden from coming into existence. While Biden seemed to be conflicted on executing his own parents, he understands that it is for the greater good of Humanity."
biden.7.a:0 "The Thread is Served"

biden.8.t:0 "Formation of APCC Forces East"
biden.8.d:0 "With the APCC's conquest on the New World well underway, Chairman Biden has ordered one of his top lieutenants, Barrack Obama, to Africa. To be exact, Kenya, where Obama's grandfather leads the Mau-Mau uprising against the colony of Kenya-Uganda. Mzee Obama has a near divine status amongst the fighers of the Mau-Mau, thus by using Barrack, Biden hopes he can use that status against Obama and turn the Mau-Mau into the basis for the APCC's eastern forces.\n\nHowever with the rise of Biden, the Mau-Mau have changed from an anti-colonialist revolt into the face of anti-Bidenist activity within the Horn of Africa. With this sudden change in enemy,   many former Keyan colonial army officer have joined the Mau-Mau's ranks, chief among them one Mad Jack Churchill, famed war hero and sword barer.\n\nWhile this is a bit of a setback, it has not stopped Obama from carrying out Biden's plan. Under the cover of darkness, Obama and a small but highly trained team was teleported straight into the headquarters of the Mau-Mau, where he confronted his grandfather. What was said between the two is unknown, however a large chunk of the original Mau-Mau forces have indeed sided with Obama, seeing him as fulfillment of prophecy. With this split in ranks, a small civil war within the Mau-Mau has begun, and Obama is making use of the chaos. Already reports of drone strikes with a reported accuracy of 90% have taken place. Most impressive of those killed by drone strike has been Herman Goring, with his death causing chaos within the Mittleafrikan administration. Overall Obama's invasion has been highly successfully, and the APCC's has already dubbed the new forces the 'APCC Forces East' "

biden.9.t:0 "The Sacking of Europe"
biden.9.d:0 "After months of fighting the forces of the various nations of the ABPSH, the APCC has finally come on top, and now occupy a majority of the major nations of Europe. From London and Rome to Berlin and Paris, the legions of Chairman Biden now control one of the historic lands in human history. Despite this historicity, we cannot allow memories or feelings get in the way of our important work. Too this end, the APCC's Purification Subcommittee has ordered, over the head of the Chairman it seems, the complete destruction of all major cities in Europe. Perhaps seeing the lands of his forefathers as awaking an amount of compassion for the nonhumans within the Chairman, a compassion that wasn't awoken even by the death of his own parents, the Purification Subcommittee's orders are already underway.\n\nMost major cities are now nothing but smoldering ruins, primed and ready for Phase Two. Special attention has been paid to Ireland, the Chairman's ancestral home. Hoping to crush his compassion once and all, the  Purification Subcommittee has ordered the entire island too be cleansed of all life, as a small-scale test of the Purification Wave that will be unleashed once the entire Earth has been cleansed of major military resistance. Regardless of the Subcommittee's orders, one of the largest areas of resistance has been cleared, and the APCC gets closer to it's final goal everyday... "

biden.10.t:0 "55 Days at Dalian"
biden.10.d:0 "As the legions of the APCC come ever closer to complete world domination, we have finally made significant ground within China, the heart of resistance in East Asia. While our efforts have been meet with great success, over the past fifty five days we been seiging the Japense held port of Dalian. Dalian, itself a major port and site of ABPSH reinforcement, had become the de facto headquarters of the ABPSH in eastern Asia. This was so much the case that Emperor Hirohito of Japan, General Falkenhausen of the A.O.G and seemingly a resurrected Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek had made Dalian their home.\n\nAs our own armies approched the city, we expected some kind of a fight, afterall it was the largest ABPSH center in Asia. However we could not have expected the amount of fire we would meet. Using captured weapons, some which appeared to have been reverse engineered, ABPSH forces were able to keep us some 30 miles outside of the city. While our aircraft were indeed able to punch into their airspace, more often then not, they would get shot down. This stalemate, the first and more then likely last of it's kind in our campaign, was unbreakable in all but one manner. Unlike APCC forces, the resistors lack the ability to recharge their weaponry, thus meaning we could starve them out, which is exactly what we did.\n\nUp until last night, both sides of the siege had done little more then exchange a little gunfire here and there. However, seemingly as they were running out of juice, the defenders of Dalian made one final desperate charge in a suicidal hope of breaking the stalemate. At the head of this charge was none other then Emperor Hirohito, followed close behind by General Falkenhausen and Generalissimo Chiang. The charge ended as quickly as it began, not even making it too our lines. While the heroics of the charge cannot be deined, with the deaths of the ABPSH's most major figures in the east, it will not be long until Phase One is finally completed, and we can begin colonization in ernest."

biden.11.d:0 "With the armies of the APCC finally arriving on the shores of South America, we have come across our first real challenge in our conquest of this world. The Amazon, the great rain forest running along most of South America, has formed a neigh unassailable barrier for our ground units. While our air units are indeed able to cross it and strike at the nations south of it, without our ground units, they can do little but annoy our enemies.\n\nIn an attempt to solve this, Chairman Biden, at the suggestion of Michael S. Regan(head of Biden's EPA) has ordered that the Amazon be bombed. Using a combination of traditional bombs, napalm and small-scale nuclear devices, the APCC is bringing the Amazon to it's knees. While so-far the destruction is mostly contained to the North, the fires spawning from the devastation are quickly spreading, and APCC scientists predict the Amazon shall be completely reduced to ash within the next few months.\n\nWhile only just beginning, our troops are already able to take advantage of the cleared ground, gaining a massive boost in their speed over the Amazon.\n\nBesides the advantage our troops gain, the Amazonian Purge serves as a perfect warning and example what we plan to do with the rest of the world. It may also just be able to get some nations to stand down, less they meet a worse fate..,"

Plans have always existed to combat a potential invasion or uprising within the United States; however, those plans were meant to deal with local radicals or foreign armies, not an ocean of forces from some alternate future. \n\n But as the most vivid nightmares of the Federal Government come true in front of their very eyes, this secret plan seems to be the only shot at salvation left for America. Most of the Federal Command structure was decimated, the entire Presidential Line of Succession (save for Vice President Charles Curtis, who was killed by a heart attack days prior) was wiped out during the Washington attack, and the majority of the Army Brass has killed off. Without a functioning army, local militias and rouge units have put up the last meaningful defense against “President Biden”. Huey Long and Bill Haywood have begrudgingly cooperated to defend what remains of America, and Omar Bradley has taken command of the remaining Federal Forces, as Douglas MacArthur, Dwight Eisenhower and most other high-raking generals have been wiped out.\n\n Some like Kennedy have tried to collaborate with Biden’s forces, only to face a quick death. Some like Fred Trump have tried to appeal to their children, however not even their family would save them from the wrath of the future. \n\n America has faced its darkest hour, and it seems as if the entire world is all but doomed.

Reportedly, these same aliens have been killing entire settlements on the various frontiers of the Earth, such as Alaska or Siberia.\n\nWhat's more, various fringe groups, such as the Spiritual Party in California or Germany's Ahnenerbe Society claim these sightings are proof of their believes, and are calling on the governments of the world to investigate these sightings, for the protection of public safety.\n\nWhile these radicals hold no power and their calls for investigations have mostly fallen on deaf ears, some members of our government who have a paranoid dispensation have secretly come forward to [ROOT.GetLeader] and requested we launch an investigation at once.

The reason for this, while seemingly a bit contradictory for the atheistic policies of Chairman Biden, was due to a request by the Preservation Subcommittee of the APCC. The Preservation Subcommittee, which was formed mostly as a way to quite those opposed to the wholesale destruction of everything on Earth, requested the Chairman allow them to preserve the Holy Land due to it's destruction in our time, which he begrudgingly accepted to keep unity within the APCC.\n\n With the Holy Land, now both depopulated and fully under our control, the Preservation Subcommittee has put forward yet another rest to the Chairman. In short, the PS wishes to use an experimental technology that would effectively 'freeze' the Holy Land as it is now in time. However, the technologically would also adapt the Holy Land to any new environmental factors that come about as a result of the Earth's repopulation during Phase Two. Doing this, the Subcommittee claims, will endear the Chairman to America's surviving religious populous.\n\nWhile a request like this is not extreme and is perhaps a no brainer, however it could also set a dangerous precedent. After all, if we agree to preserve the Holy Land, what would stop them from demanding we preserve other relics of this bygone era? Regardless, the choice is the Chairman's alone to make."
biden.18.a:0 "Agreed. What's the harm in protecting that which was lost?"
biden.18.b:0 "Denied. We have come to create a new home, not recycle the old."

biden.19.t:0 "Biden's Gift"
biden.19.d:0 "We have done it! After years of bloody fighting, the genocidal forces of Chairman Biden have finally been pushed back! This morning, in much the same way he arrived, Biden addressed every single person on the planet, using the same technology that allowed him to broadcast to every radio and TV. In his address, he praised the efforts of the ABPSH to combat his forces, saying that it was due to their sheer bravery and tact that they were able to overcome his forces. He went on to announce his formal surrender, along with an apology for killing so many millions. He said that the APCC and it's forces would return to their time, and that they would never return. He ended his address by saying he would give our world a gift, if we wished to take it.\n\n Biden said that he could offer us a return. A return to before his arrival, before the bloodshed, before the unity. All it would take it the click of button, and we could return to live before all of these, see our dead loved ones, viva the use of Biden's Time Machines. The only catch? We would have to surrender our memory of the struggle. Forget the struggle humanity fought to get to this point. Forget the sense of unity we held. To accept the gift, all we have too do is say yes or no. Due to the APCC's technologically edge, they are able to detect which would have more votes.\n\n All it took was an instance, and humanity..."
biden.19.a:0 "...was free from Biden, with the memory of the struggle intact."
biden.19.b:0 "...was on the way back to January 1st, 1936."

biden.20.t:0 "The Fall of America"
biden.20.d:0 "Following a weeks long campaign, the United States has finally completely fallen under the control of the forces of 'Chairman Biden.' Claiming to be from the future, Biden's forces have shown no mercy to anyone, regardless of age, sex or gender. Although far and few between, the United States is reportedly now little more then a wasteland, and millions of souls lay in mass graves. Already millions of refugees have fled American shores, in the hopes of avoiding the Chairman's wrath. However, with reports of Bidenist troops arriving on the Canadian and Mexican borders, it seems unlikely that Biden plans to stop with simply America...."
biden.20.a:0 "God help us all..."
biden.20.b:0 "The World shall be cleansed!"

biden.21.t:0 "Formation of the ABPSH"
biden.21.d:0 "Today in Berlin, representatives from nearly all nations not yet under the thumb of Chairman Biden announced a joint treaty of cooperation and unity in these times of great crisis. Known as the Anti-Biden Pact for the Salvation of Humanity or simply ABPSH, the pact has united nearly every single faction on the planet into a single fold, from the Entente to the Third International, every nation pledging loyalty to one of the global's factions have come together in hopes of stemming the Bidenist tide. If the ABPSH is able to be anything more then a roadblock for Biden remains to be seen. Regardless, the prayers of the world go out to the ABPSH, for if they fall, so too does the Earth."
biden.21.a:0 "Together we stand a chance!"
biden.21.b:0 "This 'ABPSH' shall do nothing but slow us down!"

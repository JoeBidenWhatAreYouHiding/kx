### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_GEORG_MULLER_DESC:0 "Admiral of the Kaiserliche Marine, veteran of the Great War and numerous other colonial conflicts across the growing Kaiserreich since long before the turn of the century, and a close and personal friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II himself who also was the man who informed the Kaiser of the Archduke’s assassination and who also was one of the admirals to talk His Highness out of continuing the unrestricted submarine warfare policy that nearly cost us the war, Georg Alexander von Müller now finds himself in the waning twilight of his long, storied, and highly decorated career leading the German garrison on the leased isle of Crete as its military governor. Hand-selected for the position by the Kaiser, Müller now leads Crete with an iron fist as he prepares Crete for future efforts of full Germanic colonization and militarization. However, in the 15 or so years he has led Crete, the island has largely existed in an uneasy status quo as Müller slowly works to weaken the civilian government without raising too much suspicion or tension while an atmosphere of an endless fleet week, regatta, or shore leave festers among his increasingly lazy servicemen, much to the chagrin of ambitious aspirants plotting against him both among his supposed allies within the German garrison’s airforce and across the Cretan Resistance. However, Müller himself also has his own reasons for being in Crete, seeing it as the future frontline of his theorized, allegedly looming race war between the noble Germanics who are destined to bring true civilization to the wider world, and the vile Slavic and Roman races that wish to see the Kaiserreich and German culture burn to ash and cinders. Overall, Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller is perhaps the only man who can maintain the stable, if lacking and lackadaisical, status quo on the island as the wolves begin to circle this aging relic of Germany’s past - that is if he can keep the pseudo-colony under control first as greater instabilities loom on the horizon."

### Ideas ###
CRE_med_base:0 "German Mediterranean Base"
CRE_med_base_desc:0 "The island of Crete, especially with its naval base on the south coast, is one of the Kaiser's beloved Mediterranean naval outposts. First earned during the fallout of the Great War as Greece was forced to lease Crete's naval bases to Germany while the island itself was placed under the control of an autonomous civilian government that favors neither Athens or Berlin, Crete is of vital importance to the German Empire's naval maneuvers and operations in the region, especially in regards to safeguarding the Kaiser's beloved new possession in Suez."
CRE_local_tensions:0 "The 'Free' State"
CRE_local_tensions_desc:0 "While on paper, Crete is an independent international mandate, in actuality it is a German-Dominated pseudo colony with a puppet civilian government which only serves to rubber stamp the Kaiserliche Marine’s agenda. While technically an independent body, the civilian government serves as little more than a pawn of the garrison, who use their air of legitimacy to keep the locals in check and ensure the naval base runs without issue. The native Cretans know this, and while many are unhappy about this state of affairs, unless something happened that shook the garrison from its perch, German soft control over Crete is here to stay."
CRE_disliked_garrison:0 "Incompetent Garrison Force"
CRE_disliked_garrison_desc:0 "The natural beauty and splendor of Crete has led to it becoming a popular destination for German Soldiers to kick back and partake in the local festivities. Outside of the rebel-infested jungles of Ostasien or the hectic savannas of Mittelafrika, the gentle political and natural climate has allowed the German Soldiers posted to the island to relax and unwind. This arrangement however has left actual military matters sorely neglected, as actual threats to the island are often ignored due to the carefree attitude of our soldiers. Many have remarked that soldiers posted to Crete are more interested in drinking, partying and bedding local women than actually doing their jobs."
CRE_partisan_activity:0 "Partisan Activity"
CRE_partisan_activity_desc:0 "After over a decade chafing under German occupation, the people of Crete have begun to fight back. From radicalized student unions in Heraklion to angry, murderous farmers armed with rock and cane, the Cretan people have finally begun to stir, likely inspired and influenced, at least in part, by foreign actors sent by the Entente, the Third Internationale, and even the Turks. Though our stay on this paradisiacal isle has been pleasant enough for now, it would seem that vacation time is over."

CRE_german_island:0 "Crete Under the Iron Cross"
CRE_german_island_desc:0 "The fears that Crete may be lost to the Kaiserreich have finally been alleviated, as it has become clear without a shadow of a doubt that the German Administration is here to stay. While the Krauts will continue on in Crete, the future shape of the Generalregierung remains to be seen."
CRE_govt_reigned_in:0 "Civilian Government Reigned In"
CRE_govt_reigned_in_desc:0 "Although we always had predominance on the island of Crete, the civil government still had the power of competent legislation, and the Cretan police were under their jurisdiction. Now we've set up an office, run by fervent collaborationists, to validate the decisions of the civil government and with unlimited veto power, ensuring that our interests will never be threatened from within."
CRE_student_organizations_crushed:0 "Student Organizations Crushed"
CRE_student_organizations_crushed_desc:0 "The Student Organizations have long been a thorn in our side. While we have tolerated them in the past, our patience has finally run out. These troublesome youngsters will have their groups disbanded, or face the consequences. "
CRE_unity_govt_idea:0 "A Cretan/German Unity Government"
CRE_unity_govt_idea_desc:0 "We can not hope to maintain control of Crete if we are reviled by locals. Attempting to root out any source of resistance is a fool’s game; instead, we must work with the Civilian Government and reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. While angering harliners, this strategy will buy us some goodwill with the people of Crete, and hopefully help us maintain German Rule."
CRE_germ_colony:0 "A Government of Germans Alone"
CRE_germ_colony_desc:0 "All pretenses of Cretan self-government have finally been put to rest as the German Garrison has officially taken full and unbridled control of the Island. While this is unpopular with both the civilian populace and the now-former Civilian Government, there is little they can do considering that the German Government has the might of the Kaiserreich behind it. "

CRE_thin_ranks:0 "Disorganized Partisan Army"
CRE_thin_ranks_desc:0 "With the German garrison finally departing from Crete, many outside observers imagined that the Resistance on the isle would proceed to celebrate the newly gained independence of their homeland. This, as it often does, turned out to be a naive perception of how the various partisan organizations interacted with each other. The Cretan Resistance was never unified beyond the goal of ejecting German imperialists, seeing as it combined forces of Socialists, Liberals and Radical Nationalists mixed with careful backing of the Entente operatives. With the only thing holding them somewhat together the emboldened and armed groups are now ready to come back to their previous squabbles, aiming to tear each other apart if they are not stopped. If the new administrators of Crete hope to prevent a tragedy years in the making, they must take decisive action to deal with the old animosities flared up anew."
CRE_power_vaccum:0 "Legacy of German Rule"
CRE_power_vaccum_desc:0 "While it would be a lie to posit that Crete had no governmental institutions or development during the German ownership era, it is nonetheless true that every aspect of those was geared toward the aims laid out by the Kaiserreich itself. In a way the island became a mix of an airstrip and a dockyard, also designed to provide simple comforts to the sailors and aces of Germany. With this situation being banished into the history books, the new government overseeing Crete and its development must somehow fill this monstrous power vacuum, awakening the isle from years of aimless slumber and disregard for local needs."

Unlike our forebears, we have achieved our independence, succeeding where they failed and driving the occupiers out of our island for good. Despite the Germans not putting up much of a fight, a tremendous feeling of resolve has washed over the Cretan Populace, as our people take pride in knowing we have made our ancestors proud."

With our coffers empty cuts must be made, and on the top of the docket is the large drain on German finances that is the Cretan Administration. While undoubtedly important for German control of the Mediterranean, the persistence of partisan groups has made the Germans weary of Crete’s value, with some wondering if the kidnapping of Hochkommissar Müller is a bleak sign of things to come."

While there has previously been an understanding that this agreement would be temporary, in practice the German Empire has treated the base as a permanent acquisition. The time has come to end any pretense, the Cretan Generalregierung is here to stay and with it the German Base."

Split between the dominant Kaiser loyalists headed by Kurt Student who seek to work with the locals and a self-serving minority who secretly swear their fealty to Göring and his goons in Mittelafrika while seeking to Germanize the entire island led by Alex Andrae and Richard Heidrich, these ambitious airmen shall battle for supremacy over one another behind the scenes as they work together to turn Crete into one giant airstrip fit for future German ambitions."

To help solidify our control, the Ottoman Directory shall empower the remaining populace, while encouraging the descendants of those who have left to return.

Working with the radicalized student unions in Heraklion and the wider Cretan Resistance, these secret and special agents seek to liberate Crete from German dominance, and either seek to create an independent Cretan state allied to the Entente, or to create a nationwide listening post on the isle while pretending to be an autonomous Cretan government in order to spy on the rest of our enemies in Suez and beyond in peace.

By working with the civilian government and all the other organizations run by local Cretans, we shall build a reliable Cretan-led democratic government without our spy clique becoming beholden to their needs or secondary to their authority.

crete.0.t:0 "The State of Crete in 1936"
crete.0.d:0 "Our beautiful island finds itself between a rock and a hard place, to put it lightly, for since our ‘independence’ that was oh so graciously granted to us by the Germans following their victory over Greece and her allies in the Great War, much to the chagrin of their Ottoman allies that still claim our isle as their own, we have been caught in crossfires of international ambitions and the desires of super powers. Crete stands not as a truly independent state, but as a pseudo-colony of the Kaiserreich thanks to egregious post-war treaties that leased out our key naval infrastructure and dockyards, centered around the massive Port of Heraklion, to the Germans and placed our Crete under a semi-autonomous civilian government forcibly kept separate and isolated from the Greek government on the mainland.\n\nAlthough the civilian government led by Alexandros Zaimis has long tried to resist German influence over these long and difficult years, the island has become increasingly dominated by the foreign military stationed on our island under the command of Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller, split between two competing forces within local branches of the Kaiserliche Marine and the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte, and each with their own bickering internal factions as well like the domineering Fallschirmjägers themselves torn between loyalty to Berlin or Göring’s machinations in Mittelafrika, revealing a fractured hierarchy that only grows more unstable the longer German rule holds on. However, things are far from better within the civilian government as arguments break out over Crete’s destiny as many wish to reunite with Greece or even the Turks as egged on by Mustafa Ertuğrul Aker, while rumors of foreign spies, meddling poets, and radicalized student organizations of both the Right and the Left gearing up for armed resistance against our occupiers worryingly abound as well. Overall, our island stands on the precipice of destiny, and like the Cretan State of 1898 before us, our island once again has a shot at true independence if we can just seize it, or shall we be resigned to march dutifully under crosses and crescents from foreign lands forevermore..."

crete.1.d:0 "Partisans, long dissatisfied with German Rule over the Island of Crete have finally made their move today, kidnapping longtime Hochkommissar of the Island Georg Alexander von Müller. Müller's car was ambushed while en route from his residence to his divisional headquarters. Müller was tied and forced into the back seat while two partisans impersonated him and his driver respectively. Müller's notorious impatience at roadblocks enabled the car to pass numerous checkpoints before being abandoned at the hamlet of Heliana. As of now the fate of Crete seems to be up in the air, as questions abound in the absence of our Hochkommissar."

crete.2.d:0 "Thousands of German Soldiers have been mobilized to hunt down the rats who have kidnapped our Hochkommissar. Müller's captors have made an unsuccessful attempt to flee to Egypt, yet have been stopped by a German Blockade. It has become clear in this time that any attempts made to escape the island would be in foolish, and they are left with two choices: surrender and hope for leniency, or execute Hochkommissar Müller and permanently end his tyranny over the island."

Crete, while holding importance as the German Lynchpin in the Mediterranean, is a rebel-infested drain on the German Empire's finances. Cutting our losses and abandoning the Island to its fate would save us dearly needed funds.

While typically ignored in the sphere of operations in the wider Empire, Crete has become a center of Paratrooper training and operations, with much of the German Brass experienced in the area moving to Crete.

crete.11.d:0 "The Zaimis Government has officially moved to transform Crete into an independent monarchy, separate from both our German Past and the Republican Greek Government. The choice for the King of an independent Crete is the immensely popular Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who has previously served as High Commissioner of Crete during the Cretan State period. In addition to his status as a Greek Royal, Prince George has also served as an Olympic Organizer and Juge, judging the weightlifting competition, and demonstrating his strength by clearing the weights at the end of the event.\n\n While some have proposed restoring the Greek Monarchy in Exile, the choosing of Prince George as King sends a powerful message that Crete is committed to its status as an independent state."

While Prince Alexander is the legitimate heir (previously serving as King before the declaration of the Republic), many see him as a liability due to his role in surrendering Greece’s Economy. In response to this, some have suggested his older brother George for the throne. As the older brother of Alexander, he is technically the more legitimate heir, with George only being passed on the throne due to him being in exile. Others have also put forward Prince Paul as a more neutral and agreeable candidate."

While it has been agreed that we must find a backer to guarantee our independence, the question of who that backer will be is much more contentious. Some favor the Germans, despite our checkered history with the Kaiser. Others suggest the Entente, others have put forward the Cairo Axis. Some more outrageous people have even suggested groveling to our old foe, the Ottomans, for protection."

crete.15.d:0 "While our path to Athens was paved with blood, we have finally managed to dislodge the false Republican Government of Greece and restore to the throne the legitimate king, [CRE.GetLeader]. The announcement of the Kingdom's restoration has been a cause for jubilation for those in favor of restoring the Monarchy, as celebrations have erupted throughout both Crete and Greece to celebrate the good news. After moving back in to the Néa Anáktora, [CRE.GetLeader] delivered an address to the wounded nation, thanking them for their resolve and promising a brighter path forwards."

crete.16.d:0 "For over a decade and a half, we Germans have lorded over the beautiful island of Crete, and now with the unrest put to rest and the scheming Souveränisten Fallschirmjägers finally put to justice like the traitors to the Kaiser they truly are, the German presence on Crete can begin to heal along with its local occupants. Under loyal men of the Kaiser begrudgingly working in uneven synchrony like Georg Alexander von Müller, Theo Osterkamp, and Kurt Student, a true Fortress Crete shall rise in service of the Kaiserreich, but what shall be the final fate of the civilian government and the Cretan identity along with it? Should we work to germanize the isle entirely while limiting the powers and autonomy of the civilian government, placing all of Crete firmly under the Iron Cross, or should we work together with these new subjects and work to build Crete up into its own autonomous and unique member of the Reichspakt?"

crete.17.t:0 "An End to any Pretense"
crete.17.d:0 "Dropping down into the halls of power and dethroning their lazy rivals within the Kaiserliche Marine, Alexander Andrae and Richard Heidrich now command the German garrison and the rest of Crete with the rest of their ravenous fallschirmjägers at their back. Keen on turning the isle into their own fiefdom, these two militarist kleptocrats have long feigned loyalty to Berlin while instead truly serving the rising ambitions of Herming Göring, Reinhard Heydrich, and the rest of the nationalistic young guard within the Souveränisten in Mittelafrika. Moving to completely eradicate the civilian government and all notion of Cretan autonomy, independence, culture, or identity, the Souveränisten Fallschirmjägers shall transform these beautiful islands into a truly German colony no matter the cost. Under these nationalist schemers led by Andrae and Heidrich, a true and fully germanized Fortress Crete shall rise in service of the Kaiserreich on paper, and to Göring and Heydrich in secluded reality."

crete.17.b:0 "Andrae shall germanize Crete entirely, no matter the cost."

crete.18.t:0 "The Evacuation of Crete"
crete.18.d:0 "News has trickled in from Heraklion that the German Garrison that has long administered the day-to-day affairs of the Island of Crete has officially withdrawn from their posts. The surrender of the German Garrison and the evacuation of the Mittelmeerflotte has quickly led to partisans marching on Heraklion and putting a final end to the German-Dominated Crete Free State. While we have officially lost control of Crete, the fact that we no longer have to worry about cleaning up the messes of inebriated sailors, or attacks from Cretan Partisans is certainly an upside to this grim situation."
crete.18.a:0 "At least this will save us some administrative costs."

crete.19.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete.19.d:0 "Good news has trickled in from Heraklion today, telling that the German Garrison that has long administered the day-to-day affairs of the Island of Crete has finally withdrawn from their posts. The sale of the island of Crete has been finalized today, ending the more than 20 years of de-facto German rule on the island. With Crete sold, the German Garrison has been evacuated, and Mittelmeerflotte has set sail for a new harbor. While some citizens of the island are upset that we have ‘Sold out their futures for pocket change’, the affairs of the island are no longer our problem. While we have lost control of Crete and their strategic ports, the fact that we no longer have to worry about cleaning up the messes of inebriated sailors, or attacks from Cretan Partisans is certainly an upside to this grim situation."
crete.19.a:0 "At least we have gained much-needed cash flow."

crete.20.t:0 "Greece Restores the Monarchy"
crete.20.d:0 "In an incredible upset, the people of Greece have decided on their own to restore the Monarchy, making our vow to reclaim Athens by force somewhat null. Celebrations have broken out across Crete, as it has become clear that a union with Greece under the Monarch can be achieved without bloodshed."
crete.20.a:0 "Wonderful news."

crete.500.t:0 "The Mediterranean Gambit"
crete.500.d:0 "With German rule over the small island of Crete fully solidified once more, the new administration has begun to draw up plans on the modernization of this little island paradise. The Maltese maintained their dominance as the preferred Mediterranean holding for too long, now it is time for the Cretans to bask in the glory of the German empire’s full might. With our strong fleet and strategic position near the Bosporus Strait and Suez Canal, our naval bastion can contest the rising power of the Egyptians, the ambitions of the small Russian fleet and any other regional power that seeks shelter among the ranks of our enemies. However, as Crete is growing more and more important to the German war machine in the Mediterranean, some younger officers and even members of the government have begun to harbour grandiose visions of the future. Citing Crete’s place as the eminent naval power of the Reichspakt in the region, they claim that for us to fulfill our place within the alliance, Crete must fully accept its responsibility as the steward of the Mare Nostrum and seek to control the strategic locations dotting the sea.\n\nGibraltar, Bosporus, Suez, Tangier, Malta and the island of Cyprus all possess qualities that would make them extremely beneficial for maintaining order in the region. If we were to seize Suez, Gibraltar and Bosporus for example, our enemies would have to circumnavigate the entire continent of Africa to get access to goods from Asia and beyond, and it would allow Crete to dominate the civilian trade to most Southern European nations. Some of these regions have long been under German dominance as well, and thus the process of integrating them into the Cretan administration would hardly be a difficult one, while others such as Tangier and Gibraltar have been under the Spanish iron boot for quite some time and would likely welcome German rule over the oppressive ways of the Madrid regime.\n\nHowever, while such plans have gained quite a bit of traction among young officers and hawkish old guard soldiers, many still view these lofty ambitions as lunacy, compromising the strength of the concentrated Cretan fleet by overstretching it over a few small colonial holdings. Some are also of the opinion that we should focus on gating away the Red Sea from intruders, making sure that the regions of Aden and Djibouti are under the German hold instead of expanding into the Communard waters of the Western Mediterranean."
crete.500.a:0 "The young dreamers are correct, the Mediterranean shall be ours alone!"
crete.500.b:0 "The young dreamers are correct, but we must focus on the Red Sea!"
crete.500.c:0 "Put these foolish ambitions to rest."

crete.501.t:0 "The Jewels of the Long-Lost Empire"
crete.501.d:0 "The island of Crete has seen many a conqueror over its long and storied history, but few are quite as unexpected as the current Entente occupation force. Under the paranoid and devious rule of the British secret service, the island has been transformed into a hive of intrigue and skullduggery. All remnants of the German and Ottoman administrations have been scrubbed clean, and while a civilian government remains as the facade to hide our activities from the clueless states around us, the reach of Crete’s intelligence officers is ever-growing. As the Mare Nostrum is the very eye of the brewing storm, the former British territories in the region are more and more vulnerable as resources are directed to the fronts in European mainland. The Spaniards, weakened by decades of infighting, are no longer the unquestioned masters of the Gibraltar, while the Germans and their holdouts in Suez and Malta are increasingly compromised as the gigantic colonial projects siphon away their resources and Black Monday continues to wreak havoc upon their economy.\n\nIt would appear that the time is ripe for Britain’s most cunning sons to reclaim that which belongs to the crown in the Mediterranean, from the Pillars of Hercules in Gibraltar to the prestigious canal of the Red Sea. Our old enemies, the Ottomans, shall return Cyprus to us as well, and some of the most hawkish members of the new regime have also claimed that the new Dominion of Crete should reclaim the long-lost holdings of the empire in the Balearics, where British rule over the island of Menorca lasted for numerous decades, as well as the island of Corfu, held by nearly half a century as well.\n\nHowever, going down a warpath so soon after we have merely solidified our rule is risky business, and many within the ranks of the Secret Service view this as a ludicrous proposal, one inviting more scrutiny on our little island hideout. They claim that the restoration of the Windsors on the throne of Britain is the most important goal of all, and that the Jewels of the Empire can be reclaimed in full force once London is back in the hands of the rightful king. Going after our wayward claims now would be wasteful and reckless, or so the alarmists claim."
crete.501.a:0 "Without full control of the Mediterranean, the empire shall never rise again!"
crete.501.b:0 "This is nonsensical waste of time."

crete.502.t:0 "Enosis on Our Terms?"
crete.502.d:0 "The Cretan Kingdom under king Georgiós has only just taken its first steps in the world, but already Greek nationalists eye our island with hungry eyes, seeking to force their rule upon our island. When an independent Cretan Kingdom was proclaimed, it was always done in order to preserve the unique nature and characteristics of the Cretans over the stifling and chauvinistic attitudes of the Athenians. However, while the Cretan identity is quickly taking shape, and a sort of cultural renaissance has begun on the island after the Kingdom decided to follow its own path, there is an undeniable sense of unity between Cretans and Greeks that yet lingers even despite the supposed severing of ties. However, something that both the monarchists of Zamvis and the republicans of Tsouderos agree is that Cretan needs must always come first, even if it were to return to the mainland. Nonetheless, the exact nature of how the Cretans would go about forging a new Cretan-led Greek nation are murky at best, with many looking to the ancient Minoan past for guidance, calling for Crete to take the Peloponnese peninsula and parts of the great island chains in the strait of Bosporus for itself, just as the ancient Minoan empire did. Others, such as Zamvis, claim that our great nation should be the leader of the Greeks, and simply annex all of Greece into a Cretan-led nation. Finally, some of the most hawkish members of the Cretan society have openly called for Crete to fínalize the irredentist dream of all nationalist Greeks around the world, by conquering all the lands of the Megali idea under the unified Greco-Cretan banner. The most moderate solution posited by some republicans is to simply seek unification with Cyclades, Dodecanese and Aegean islands, and various other smaller islands and islets around Crete."
crete.502.a:0 "Only the full Cretan-Greek homeland of the Megali idea shall satisfy us!"
crete.502.b:0 "We must unify Greece under an equal federation under Crete."

crete.502.f:0 "We did not become independent just to take more land from others."

crete.503.t:0 "Destiny of Turkish Crete"
crete.503.d:0 "Now that Crete is once more secured as an integral part of the Ottoman empire, the government can get to work on transforming it into a loyal constituent of the Ottoman order. However  questions of the future of Crete under the Turkish thumb have been raised by Muslims and Christians alike, and many demand answers that the provisional Vilayet government has thus far been incapable to give an answer to. Given the heavy resistance from local Orthodox population towards joining the Ottoman empire outright, the Turkish administration seeks to remain de jure independent of the Ottoman state, but still heavily aligned with them.\n\nWith this option is taken, the government has considered a new direction for the destiny of Crete. Inspired by the Emirate of Crete founded by Andalusian exiles in the 8th century. The Emirate would evolve into a corsair state, preying on Byzantine shipping and raiding the Greek coast for plunder, though it rarely conquered land for itself. We could seek to dominate the Mediterranean in similar fashion, integrating Greek island territories and Dalmatian islands that the Emirate raided, as well as the island of Cyprus that possesses a similar mixture of Greek and Turkish population. Some also claim that we should conquer the island of Malta, an island that the Ottomans failed to conquer so long ago.\n\nHowever, while these Mediterranean conquests seem lucrative to some, the Ottoman cause calls for others, and the most warlike Cretan Turks have called for us to continue spearheading the Ottoman conquests by reestablishing the Eyalet of Rumelia, bringing all of Greece back under the Ottoman rule once more. It is clear from the endless instability of the Peloponnesos that the Greeks are too prone to infighting to truly rule themselves, and according to these radicals, a total conquest under the Cretan Turks, who are best equipped to hand the Greeks thanks to decades and centuries of experience, is the best alternative. There are many paths to be taken by the Cretan Turks, but only one solution to be chosen."
crete.503.a:0 "The Emirate of Creta shall be our greatest inspiration."

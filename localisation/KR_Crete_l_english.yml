### Leader Bios ###

POLITICS_GEORG_MULLER_DESC:0 "Admiral of the Kasierliche Marine, veteran of the Great War and numerous other colonial conflicts across the growing Kaiserreich since long before the turn of the century, and a close and personal friend of Kaiser Wilhelm II himself who also was the man who informed the Kaiser of the Archduke’s assassination and who also was one of the admirals to talk His Highness out of continuing the unrestricted submarine warfare policy that nearly cost us the war, Georg Alexander von Müller now finds himself in the waning twilight of his long, storied, and highly decorated career leading the German garrison on the leased isle of Crete as its military governor. Hand-selected for the position by the Kaiser, Müller now leads Crete with an iron fist as he prepares Crete for future efforts of full Germanic colonization and militarization. However, in the 15 or so years he has led Crete, the island has largely existed in an uneasy status quo as Müller slowly works to weaken the civilian government without raising too much suspicion or tension while an atmosphere of an endless fleet week, regatta, or shore leave festers among his increasingly lazy servicemen, much to the chagrin of ambitious aspirants plotting against him both among his supposed allies within the German garrison’s airforce and across the Cretan Resistance. However, Müller himself also has his own reasons for being in Crete, seeing it as the future frontline of his theorized, allegedly looming race war between the noble Germanics who are destined to bring true civilization to the wider world, and the vile Slavic and Roman races that wish to see the Kaiserreich and German culture burn to ash and cinders. Overall, Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller is perhaps the only man who can maintain the stable, if lacking and lackadaisical, status quo on the island as the wolves begin to circle this aging relic of Germany’s past - that is if he can keep the pseudo-colony under control first as greater instabilities loom on the horizon."

### Ideas ###
CRE_med_base:0 "German Mediterranean Base"
CRE_med_base_desc:0 "The island of Crete, especially with its naval base on the south coast, is one of the Kaiser's beloved Mediterranean naval outposts. First earned during the fallout of the Great War as Greece was forced to lease Crete's naval bases to Germany while the island itself was placed under the control of an autonomous civilian government that favors neither Athens or Berlin, Crete is of vital importance to the German Empire's naval maneuvers and operations in the region, especially in regards to safeguarding the Kaiser's beloved new possession in Suez."
CRE_local_tensions:0 "The 'Free' State"
CRE_local_tensions_desc:0 "While on paper, Crete is an independent international mandate, in actuality it is a German-Dominated pseudo colony with a puppet civilian government which only serves to rubber stamp the Kaiserliche Marine’s agenda. While technically an independent body, the civilian government serves as little more than a pawn of the garrison, who use their air of legitimacy to keep the locals in check and ensure the naval base runs without issue. The native Cretans know this, and while many are unhappy about this state of affairs, unless something happened that shook the garrison from its perch, German soft control over Crete is here to stay."
CRE_disliked_garrison:0 "Incompetent Garrison Force"
CRE_disliked_garrison_desc:0 "The natural beauty and splendor of Crete has led to it becoming a popular destination for German Soldiers to relax and unwind. Outside of the rebel-infested jungles of Ostasien or the hectic savannas of Mittelafrika, the gentle political and natural climate however has allowed the German Soldiers posted to the island to relax and unwind. This arrangement however has left actual military matters sorely neglected, as actual threats to the island are often ignored due to the carefree attitude of our soldiers. Many have remarked that soldiers posted to Crete are more interested in drinking, partying and bedding local women than actually doing their jobs."
CRE_partisan_activity:0 "Partisan Activity"
CRE_partisan_activity_desc:0 "After over a decade chafing under German occupation, the people of Crete have begun to fight back. From radicalized student unions in Heraklion to angry, murderous farmers armed with rock and cane, the Cretan people have finally begun to stir, likely inspired and influence, at least in part, by foreign actors sent by the Entente, the Third Internationale, and even the Turks. Though our stay on this paradisiacal isle has been pleasant enough for now, it would seem that vacation time is over."

CRE_govt_reigned_in_desc:0 "Although we always had predominance on the island of Crete, the civil government still had the power of competent legislation, and the Cretan police were under their jurisdiction. Now we've set up an office, run by fervent collaborationists, to validate the decisions of the civil government and with unlimited veto power, ensuring that our interests will never be threatened from within."

CRE_germ_colony_desc:0 "All pretenses of Cretan self-government have finally been put to rest as the German Garrison has officially taken full and unbridled control of the Island. While this is unpopular with both the civilian populace and the now-former Civilian Government, there is little they can do considering that the German Government has the might of the Kaiserreich behind it. "

CRE_thin_ranks:0 "Disorganized Partisan Army"
CRE_thin_ranks_desc:0 "With the German garrison finally departing from Crete, many outside observers imagined that the Resistance on the isle would proceed to celebrate the newly gained independence of their homeland. This, as it often does, turned out to be a naive perception of how the various partisan organizations interacted with each other. The Cretan Resistance was never unified beyond the goal of ejecting German imperialists, seeing as it combined forces of Socialists, Liberals and Radical Nationalists mixed with careful backing of the Entente operatives. With the only thing holding them somewhat together the emboldened and armed groups are now ready to come back to their previous squabbles, aiming to tear each other apart if they are not stopped. If the new administrators of Crete hope to prevent a tragedy years in the making, they must take decisive action to deal with the old animosities flared up anew."
CRE_power_vaccum:0 "Legacy of German Rule"
CRE_power_vaccum_desc:0 "While it would be a lie to posit that Crete had no governmental institutions or development during the German ownership era, it is nonetheless true that every aspect of those was geared toward the aims laid out by the Kaiserreich itself. In a way the island became a mix of an airstrip and a dockyard, also designed to provide simple comforts to the sailors and aces of Germany. With this situation being banished into the history books, the new government overseeing Crete and its development must somehow fill this monstrous power vacuum, awakening the isle from years of aimless slumber and disregard for local needs."

CRE_island_under_iron_cross_desc:0 "The German Empire has maintained control of Crete ever since the island was lost to Greece in the Treaty of Salonika. Thus far the situation in the island has been relatively stable, with partisans organizing under the surface and a civilian government managing the affairs of the state. Whether 1936 will prove to be the year that will see it all undone remains to be seen. "
CRE_survey_garrison:0 "Survey the Garrison"
CRE_survey_garrison_desc:0 "The German Garrison which has maintained order in Crete has a somewhat contentious status among the populace of Crete. While they maintain German Rule, the discontent caused by this rowdy band Krauts may mean that they’re more trouble than they’re worth."
CRE_civilian_conflict:0 "Civilian Conflicts"
CRE_civilian_conflict_desc:0 "The Civilian Government maintained under German Rule is largely powerless, however discontent within the island may prove to change this.

CRE_black_monday_strikes:0 "A Time of Troubles"
CRE_black_monday_strikes_desc:0 "Lo and behold, 1936 has brought our dear Kaiserreich nothing but unbridled tragedy. With our coffers empty cuts must be made, and on the top of the docket is the large drain on German finances that is the Cretan Administration. While undoubtedly important for German control of the Mediterranean, the persistence of partisan groups has made the Germans weary of Crete’s value, with some wondering if the kidnapping of Governor Müller is a bleak sign of things to come."

CRE_steady_as_she_goes:0 "Steady as She Goes"
CRE_steady_as_she_goes_desc:0 "The fears that Crete may be lost to the Kaiserreich have finally been alleviated, as it has become clear without a shadow of a doubt that the German Administration is here to stay.

CRE_reign_in_crete_govt:0 "Control the Civilian Government"
CRE_reign_in_crete_govt_desc:0 "While the Civilian Government has provided us with an ere of legitimacy, it appears that they have taken their meager jobs to heart.

CRE_permanant_lease:0 "A Permanent Lease"
CRE_permanant_lease_desc:0 "The German Empire has maintained a lease on the port of Heraklion ever since they gained control of the Island. While there has previously been an understanding that this agreement would be temporary, in practice the German Empire has treated the base as a permanent acquisition. The time has come to end any pretense, the Cretan Generalregierung is here to stay and with it the German Base."
CRE_expand_base:0 "Pacification of Crete"
CRE_expand_base_desc:0 "The German Power base has been concentrated around Heraklion , with the rest of the island being left to its own means.

No more shall weakness or reform be allowed, as the German Empire moves to secure the Jewel of the Mediterranean with an Iron Fist."
CRE_unity_govt:0 "Form a Unity Government"
CRE_unity_govt_desc:0 "We can not hope to maintain control of Crete if we are reviled by locals. Attempting to root out any source of resistance is a fool’s game; instead, we must work with the Civilian Government and reach a mutually agreeable conclusion. While angering harliners, this strategy will buy us some goodwill with the people of Crete, and hopefully help us maintain German Rule."

CRE_paratrooper_state_desc:0 "Finally surpassing their rivals in the Kaiserliche Marine, the Fallschirmjägers of the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte are now free to bring their own form of nationalist militarism and Prussian stratocracy to their new home. Split between the dominant Kaiser loyalists headed by Kurt Student who seek to work with the locals and a self-serving minority who secretly swear their fealty to Goering and his goons in Mittelafrika while seeking to Germanize the entire island led by Alex Andrae and Richard Heidrich, these ambitious airmen shall battle for supremacy over one another behind the scenes as they work together to turn Crete into one giant airstrip fit for future German ambitions."

CRE_end_of_germs:0 "The Evacuation"

CRE_monarchy_desc:0 "The Monarchist Alexandros Zaimis has gained control of Crete’s Government.

CRE_crete_monarchy:0 "An Independent Kingdom"
CRE_crete_monarchy_desc:0 "The Greeks have made their thoughts on Monarchism clear, and while we respect their choice, we no longer wish to be involved in the Greek Project.

CRE_cretan_muslims_desc:0 "While once Crete was home to a robust population of Muslims, as of now few remain of the once thriving population. Despite Germans helping to smooth over once inflamed religious tensions, on the island much of the Muslim population that had once settled on this island have never returned. To help solidify our control, the Ottoman Directory shall empower the remaining populace, while encouraging the descendants of those who have left to return. Additionally, the construction of Mosques and other Muslim Places of Worship will aid in Crete's conversion to Islam and adjustment to Turkish Rule; even if most Muslims still identify as 'Greek Muslims'."

CRE_entente_govt_desc:0 "Long working on Crete on orders of the Crown on his Majesty’s Secret Service, the hidden espionage clique of the Special Operations Executive operating under Sir Patrick Leigh Fermor and Ivan William Stanley Moss now control the destiny of the isle. Working with the radicalized student unions in Heraklion and the wider Cretan Resistance, these secret and special agents seek to liberate Crete from German dominance, and either seek to create an independent Cretan state allied to the Entente, or to create a nationwide listening post on the isle while pretending to be an autonomous Cretan government in order to spy on the rest of our enemies in Suez and beyond in peace.

By working with the civilian government and all the other organizations run by local Cretans, we shall build a reliable Cretan-led democratic government without our spy clique becoming beholden to their needs or secondary to their authority. Hand in hand with Crete, we will build a better island for both the natives and ourselves."

crete.0.d:0 "Our beautiful island finds itself between a rock and a hard place, to put it lightly, for since our ‘independence’ that was oh so graciously granted to us by the Germans following their victory over Greece and her allies in the Great War, much to the chagrin of their Ottoman allies that still claim our isle as their own, we have been caught in crossfires of international ambitions and the desires of super powers. Crete stands not as a truly independent state, but as a pseudo-colony of the Kaiserreich thanks to egregious post-war treaties that leased out our key naval infrastructure and dockyards, centered around the massive Port of Heraklion, to the Germans and placed our Crete under a semi-autonomous civilian government forcibly kept separate and isolated from the Greek government on the mainland. \n\nAlthough the civilian government led by Alexandros Zaimis has long tried to resist German influence over these long and difficult years, the island has become increasingly dominated by the foreign military stationed on our island under the command of Admiral Georg Alexander von Müller, split between two competing forces within local branches of the Kaiserliche Marine and the Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte, and each with their own bickering internal factions as well like the domineering Fallschirmjägers themselves torn between loyalty to Berlin or Goering’s machinations in Mittelafrika, revealing a fractured hierarchy that only grows more unstable the longer German rule holds on. However, things are far from better within the civilian government as arguments break out over Crete’s destiny as many wish to reunite with Greece or even the Turks as egged on by Mustafa Ertuğrul Aker, while rumors of foreign spies, meddling poets, and radicalized student organizations of both the Right and the Left gearing up for armed resistance against our occupiers worryingly abound as well. Overall, our island stands on the precipice of destiny, and like the Cretan State of 1898 before us, our island once again has a shot at true independence if we can just seize it, or shall we be resigned to march dutifully under crosses and crescents from foreign lands forevermore..."
crete.0.a:0 "Eleftheria i Thanatos!"

crete.1.t:0 "Georg Alexander von Müller Disappears"
crete.1.d:0 "Partisans, long dissatisfied with German Rule over the Island of Crete have finally made their move today, kidnapping longtime Governor of the Island Georg Alexander von Müller. Müller's car was ambushed while en route from his residence to his divisional headquarters. Müller was tied and forced into the back seat while two partisans impersonated him and his driver respectively. Müller's notorious impatience at roadblocks enabled the car to pass numerous checkpoints before being abandoned at the hamlet of Heliana. As of now the fate of Crete seems to be up in the air, as questions abound in the absence of our Governor."
crete.1.a:0 "Dreadful!"

crete.2.t:0 "Finding Müller"
crete.2.d:0 "Thousands of German Soldiers have been mobilized to hunt down the rats who have kidnapped our Governor. Müller's captors have made an unsuccessful attempt to flee to Egypt, yet have been stopped by a German Blockade. It has become clear in this time that any attempts made to escape the island would be in foolish, and they are left with two choices: surrender and hope for leniency, or execute Governor Müller and permanently end his tyranny over the island."
crete.2.a:0 "We Found him Just in Time!"
crete.2.b:0 "We were too late, the Governor is dead..."

crete.3.t:0 "A New Governor"
crete.3.d:0 "With Müller dying in a failed kidnapping attempt, a new Governor is needed for our island. The choices are the more harsh Alexander Andrae, the more moderate Theo Osterkamp, or the paratrooper Walter Koch. "
crete.3.a:0 "Alexander Andrae."
crete.3.b:0 "Walter Koch."
crete.3.c:0 "Theo Osterkamp."

crete.4.t:0 "Restructuring"
crete.4.d:0 "With Black Monday striking the German Sphere, cutbacks must be made. The first place that came to mind for the bean-counters in Berlin was the German-Held island of Crete. Crete, while holding importance as the German Lynchpin in the Mediterranean, is a rebel-infested drain on the German Empire's finances. Cutting our losses and abandoning the Island to its fate would save us dearly needed funds. We could also attempt to sell the Island to one of its neighbors, who have long squabbles over the territory."
crete.4.a:0 "We have nothing, Sell the Damn Island..."
crete.4.b:0 "German Rule over Crete is Doomed, Prepare to Flee!"
crete.4.c:0 "We will hold on to Crete by any means!"

crete.5.t:0 "The Fate of Crete"
crete.5.d:0 "With the German Garrison evacuating Crete, a temporary civilian government has been formed to decide the future of Crete. The question on everyone's mind is what form the new State of Crete will take. Will we rejoin Greece? The Ottoman Empire? Shall we look to the Exiles for protection? All must be answered soon."
crete.5.a:0 "Emmanouil Tsouderos founds a Venizelist Liberal Democracy!"
crete.5.b:0 "Alexandros Zaimis establishes a Pro-Greek Regency Council!"
crete.5.c:0 "Patrick Leigh Fermor and his Entente Spies seize control!"

crete.6.t:0 "Chaos in the Fallschirmjäger Ranks"
crete.6.d:0 "The appointment of Walter Koch as Governor of Crete has allowed the prestigious Fallschirmjäger, or Paratroopers, to gain sway within the Military Governance of Crete. While typically ignored in the sphere of operations in the wider Empire, Crete has become a center of Paratrooper training and operations, with much of the German Brass experienced in the area moving to Crete. This has led to a new band of radicals who flavor new and radical forms of warfare gunning for Crete's top job."
crete.6.a:0 "Richard Heidrich Seizes Control and Establishes a Government Loyal to von Göring!"
crete.6.b:0 "Kurt Student Restores Order and stays with Berlin."

crete.7.t:0 "Rejoin the Homeland?"
crete.7.d:0 "With the German Empire being expelled from Crete's shores, the question of re-union with Greece has emerged. While many are in favour of this, others are more skeptical of rejoining the Athens Government."
crete.7.a:0 "The Time has Come to Reunify!"
crete.7.b:0 "On Second Thought, let us Retain Independence!"

crete.8.t:0 "Crete Returns Home"
crete.8.d:0 "While this year has brought us catastrophe after catastrophe, it seems one piece of good news has trickled to [GRE.GetLeader]'s desk. The Island of Crete, formerly a German possession, has thrown off its chains and is now looking to rejoin Greece. Our humiliating loss of Crete has now been undone, as the Nation of Greece is one step closer to being whole."
crete.8.a:0 "Excellent News!"

crete.9.t:0 "Revolution in Crete"
crete.9.d:0 "It was hoped after the German Evacuation of Crete that the Island would return to Greek Rule, however that has turned out not to be the case as [CRE.GetLeader] has formally refused the prospect of rejoining Greece. This refusal has infuriated [GRE.GetLeader], who is mulling the possibility of using force to take back the now unprotected island."
crete.9.a:0 "Unacceptable, Launch an Invasion at Once!"
crete.9.b:0 "Such a thing would be Useless Bloodsh

crete.10.t:0 "Crete Rejoins Greece"
crete.10.d:0 "The outcome of the German abandonment of Crete was the Pro-Entente Partisans led by Patrick Leigh Fermor seizing control of the Island. Now with Greece also joining the Entente, negotiations for bringing Crete back in to the Greek Nation have succeeded. Now, Greece is one step closer to being whole. "
crete.10.a:0 "Wonderful!"

crete.11.t:0 "The Kingdom of Crete"
crete.11.d:0 "The Zaimis Government has officially moved to transform Crete into an independent monarchy, separate from both our German Past and the Republican Greek Government. The choice for the King of an independent Crete is the immensely popular Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who has previously served as High Commissioner of Crete during the Cretan State period. In addition to his status as a Greek Royal, Prince George has also served as an Olympic Organizer and Juge, judging the weightlifting competition, and demonstrating his strength by clearing the weights at the end of the event.\n\n While some have proposed restoring the Greek Monarchy in Exile, the choosing of Prince George as King sends a powerful message that Crete is committed to its status as an independent state."
crete.11.a:0 "Long live Geórgios I, King of Crete!"

crete.12.t:0 "Greek Monarchy Restored in Crete"
crete.12.d:0 "With the decision reached to restore the Greek Monarchy in Crete, the question on everyone's mind is who shall ascend to the Greek Throne in Exile. While Prince Alexander is the legitimate heir (previously serving as King before the declaration of the Republic), many see him as a liability due to his role in surrendering Greece’s Economy. In response to this, some have suggested his older brother George for the throne. As the older brother of Alexander, he is technically the more legitimate heir, with George only being passed on the throne due to him being in exile. Others have also put forward Prince Paul as a more neutral and agreeable candidate."
crete.12.a:0 "Prince Alexander shall be Crowned as Aléxandros I!"
crete.12.b:0 "Prince George shall be Crowned as Geórgios II!"
crete.12.c:0 "Prince Paul shall be Crowned as Pávlos I!"

crete.14.t:0 "A Foreign Backer?"
crete.14.d:0 "Our island exists in a fragile state of peace; however few believe that we can truly remain at peace unless we can manage to find a major power to protect Crete. While it has been agreed that we must find a backer to guarantee our independence, the question of who that backer will be is much more contentious. Some favor the Germans, despite our checkered history with the Kaiser. Others suggest the Entente, others have put forward the Cairo Pact. Some more outrageous people have even suggested groveling to our old foe, the Ottomans, for protection."
crete.14.a:0 "Reach out to the Exiles in Ottawa."
crete.14.b:0 "Reach out to our Old Masters, the Germans."
crete.14.c:0 "Reach out to the Sultan and the Sublime Porte."
crete.14.e:0 "Reach out to the Egyptians and the Cairo Pact."

crete.15.t:0 "Greece Reclaimed"
crete.15.d:0 "While our path to Athens was paved with blood, we have finally managed to dislodge the false Republican Government of Greece and restore to the throne the legitimate king, [CRE.GetLeader]. The announcement of the Kingdom's restoration has been a cause for jubilation for those in favor of restoring the Monarchy, as celebrations have erupted throughout both Crete and Greece to celebrate the good news. After moving back in to the Néa Anáktora, [CRE.GetLeader] delivered an address to the wounded nation, thanking them for their resolve and promising a brighter path forwards."
crete.15.a:0 "Na zísei o vasiliás!"

crete.16.t:0 "An End to any Pretense?"
crete.16.d:0 "For over a decade and a half, we Germans have lorded over the beautiful island of Crete, and now with the unrest put to rest and the scheming Souveränisten Fallschirmjägers finally put to justice like the traitors to the Kaiser they truly are, the German presence on Crete can begin to heal along with its local occupants. Under loyal men of the Kaiser begrudgingly working in uneven synchrony like Georg Alexander von Müller, Theo Osterkamp, and Kurt Student, a true Fortress Crete shall rise in service of the Kaiserreich, but what shall be the final fate of the civilian government and the Cretan identity along with it? Should we work to germanize the isle entirely while limiting the powers and autonomy of the civilian government, placing all of Crete firmly under the Iron Cross, or should we work together with these new subjects and work to build Crete up into its own autonomous and unique member of the Reichspakt?"
crete.16.a:0 "Crete shall be German in Name and Spirit!"
crete.16.b:0 "Crete can have a little independence, as a treat."

crete.17.t:0 "An End to any Pretense"
crete.17.d:0 "Dropping down into the halls of power and dethroning their lazy rivals within the Kasierliche Marine, Alexander Andrae and Richard Heidrich now command the German garrison and the rest of Crete with the rest of their ravenous fallschirmjägers at their back. Keen on turning the isle into their own fiefdom, these two militarist kleptocrats have long feigned loyalty to Berlin while instead truly serving the rising ambitions of Herming Goering, Reinhard Heydrich, and the rest of the nationalistic young guard within the Souveränisten in Mittelafrika. Moving to completely eradicate the civilian government and all notion of Cretan autonomy, independence, culture, or identity, the Souveränisten Fallschirmjägers shall transform these beautiful islands into a truly German colony no matter the cost. Under these nationalist schemers led by Andrae and Heidrich, a true and fully germanized Fortress Crete shall rise in service of the Kaiserreich on paper, and to Goering and Heydrich in secluded reality."
crete.17.a:0 "Andrae shall germanize Crete entirely, no matter the cost."
crete.17.b:0 "Heidrich will build a fiefdom for his fallschirmjägers!"

crete.18.t:0 "The Evacuation of Crete"
crete.18.d:0 "News has trickled in from Heraklion that the German Garrison that has long administered the day-to-day affairs of the Island of Crete has officially withdrawn from their posts. The surrender of the German Garrison and the evacuation of the Mittelmeerflotte has quickly led to partisans marching on Heraklion and putting a final end to the German-Dominated Crete Free State. While we have officially lost control of Crete, the fact that we no longer have to worry about cleaning up the messes of inebriated sailors, or attacks from Cretan Partisans is certainly an upside to this grim situation."
crete.18.a:0 "At least this will save us some administrative costs."

crete.19.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete.19.d:0 "Good news has trickled in from Heraklion today, telling that the German Garrison that has long administered the day-to-day affairs of the Island of Crete has finally withdrawn from their posts. The sale of the island of Crete has been finalized today, ending the more than 20 years of de-facto German rule on the island. With Crete sold, the German Garrison has been evacuated, and Mittelmeerflotte has set sail for a new harbor. While some citizens of the island are upset that we have ‘Sold out their futures for pocket change’, the affairs of the island are no longer our problem. While we have lost control of Crete and their strategic ports, the fact that we no longer have to worry about cleaning up the messes of inebriated sailors, or attacks from Cretan Partisans is certainly an upside to this grim situation."
crete.19.a:0 "At least we have gained much-needed cash flow."

crete_sale.1.t:0 "The Cretan Question"
crete_sale.1.d:0 "With our economy in shambles after Black Monday, our Colonial Empire has been under fairly harsh scrutiny. The main territory that has been under examination is Crete. Crete is larger and harder to defend than Malta, and the upkeep is higher as well. To help with our deficit, it has been proposed that we essentially sell the island to either the Ottomans or the Greeks. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.1.a:0 "Keep Crete under our influence."
crete_sale.1.b:0 "Offer Crete to the Ottomans."
crete_sale.1.c:0 "Offer Crete to the Greeks."

crete_sale.2.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"
crete_sale.2.d:0 "The Germans have come offering the sale of Crete. While it would obviously cost us a sizeable amount of money, having the island once more would greatly strengthen our position in the Mediterranean. What shall our reply be?"

crete_sale.2.b:0 "We do not need that rock."

crete_sale.3.t:0 "The Sale of Crete"

crete_sale.3.a:0 "Great."

crete_sale.4.t:0 "The Ottomans don't want Crete"
crete_sale.4.d:0 "The Ottomans have replied to our offer, flatly stating that they do not want Crete. What shall we do?"

crete_sale.7.b:0 "Offer it to the Ottoman Empire."

crete_sale.8.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete_sale.8.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As the Cretan State was originally created because of our weak grasp on the island, the majority of the ministers are pushing to just shuffling the government in Crete. However a few hawkish men are calling for direct annexation. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.8.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
crete_sale.8.b:0 "End its autonomy!"

crete_sale.9.t:0 "The Cretan State"
crete_sale.9.d:0 "With the transaction finalised with the Germans, the status of the Cretan state has come to the forefront of our agenda. As Crete was ours before we lost the Weltkrieg, the majority of the ministers are pushing to annex the Cretan state. However, a few men are calling for only an indirect subordination of Crete. What shall we do?"
crete_sale.9.a:0 "Install a new Cretan government."
crete_sale.9.b:0 "Hurrah for the second Enosis!"

crete_sale.10.t:0 "The Second Weltkrieg!"

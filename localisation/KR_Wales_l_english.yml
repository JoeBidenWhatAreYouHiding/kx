### Leader Descriptions ###

POLITICS_WAL_REGENCY_DESC:0 "With the conquest of the British Isles, Wales has been granted its freedom from English oppression at the price of becoming another cog in the Mitteleuropa machine, effectively put back under the oppression it experienced under England. While plans have been drawn up for the young kingdom to have a monarchy of its own, tying it back to Germany, unlike its English and Scottish counterparts there is no obvious candidate for the throne and few German princes wish to abandon their continental holdings to govern this unstable fiefdom. A Regency Council comprised of local elites, german officers and various nobles has been established to decide on the new king and rule until he is found."
POLITICS_SAUNDERS_LEWIS_DESC:0 "The life of Saunders Lewis would start relatively unremarkable. He served in France during the First World War, and after that would serve as a teacher who would conduct lectures in Welsh. Lewis had saw what had been achieved in Ireland, and with that was inspired along with many others to strive for the complete independence of Wales. And as the British Revolution came, the time to act against the Anglo oppressors was now. Lewis founded the "National Party of Wales", which’s had goals to make a fully Welsh-Speaking Wales; however, through the years found itself drawn into the storm of military conflict with the newly formed Union of Britain. This drew Lewis’ party underground and formed out of it the Welsh Home Rule Army, a terrorist organization dedicated to Welsh Independence. Normally it would have stayed as a mere terrorist group, but the collapse of the Union of Britain and the subsequent succession of Scotland lead to Wales too abandoning the Union of Britain. And with the UOB’s collapse, the WHRA rose up against the tyrannical forces of Mosley to help establish an independent Wales. However, they made peace with Y’ Glais’ socialist government to do so. But once the war ended, Lewis deposed Y’ Glais, and to pander to the international stage established a “Regency Council”. This however did not lead to a King being crowned, and after it’s disillusion Lewis became the unchallenged master of Wales. Its destiny is still unclear, but regardless one thing will persevere under Lewis’ Rule: Wales’ freedom"

### Focuses ###

WAL_united_front:0 "The Welsh United Front"

WAL_to_the_battlefield_desc:0 "The English invader can try and subjugate Wales but will never succeed. We are the sons of Glyndwr and will defend our homeland to the last man. We will resist their tyranny. They can kill every last Welshman and still our mountains will resist them, our rivers will resist them, the very soil beneath their feet will rise up against them. We are the Cymry and we will not yield."
WAL_fortify_the_border:0 "Emergency Fortifications"
WAL_fortify_the_border_desc:0 "Fortifications must be made so that we can repel the invader. This is no conventional war and thus our fortifications must reflect that. Every town across our nation must have defenses built. Outposts will be built in churches and in homes, in shops and in farms. We fight for our people and our defenses will surround our people."
WAL_emergency_recruitment:0 "Emergency Recruitment"
WAL_emergency_recruitment_desc:0 "This is the moment we have been waiting over eight-hundred years for. Every available man must serve our nation. We will defend her until our dying breath."

WAL_more_guns_desc:0 "The English oppressor has long had a military presence on Welsh soil and today that will be their undoing. Seize their armouries! Use their own weapons of tyranny against them!"
WAL_standard_production:0 "Standardize Arms Production"
WAL_standard_production_desc:0 "If our army is to be organised and effective its equipment must reflect that. Standardise arms production and our army will become all the more terrifying to the Mosleyites who think they own our land."
WAL_begin_negotiations:0 "Begin The Negotiations"
WAL_begin_negotiations_desc:0 "We are finally free of foreign oppression after eight hundred years of colonial tyranny. Now negotiations must take place to establish what peace we have won. Begin the negotiations!"
WAL_negotiations_succeed:0 "The Negotiations Succeed!"
WAL_negotiations_succeed_desc:0 "Despite our differences the socialists in the WTUC and the reactionary forces of the WHRA have come to an agreement. They will build our young nation together."
WAL_negotiations_fail:0 "The Negotiations Fail!"
WAL_negotiations_fail_desc:0 "The WHRA, appalled at the idea socialism would be enshrined in the Welsh constitution, has refused to take part in any further negotiations vowing to resist any attempt to enforce socialism on the Welsh people. Only time will tell what this means for Wales."

WAL_coup_defeated:0 "Long Live The Worker's Republic!"
WAL_coup_defeated_desc:0 "The traitorous Lewis and his reactionary lapdog army have been sufficiently dealt with, the Mosleyite bullies to our east have been repelled and finally after nearly a millennium of oppression the Welsh people are free. Cofiwch Glyndwr! Cofiwch Pendreryn! Cofiwch Maclean! Long Live the Workers Republic!"
WAL_syndie_constitution:0 "Create The Syndicalist Constitution"
WAL_syndie_constitution_desc:0 "Now that we are free of the reactionaries, we may craft a truly radical constitution for the people of Wales. Many of the union representatives in the WTUC have formed the Central Federation of Labour behind Jim Griffiths to act as a powerful voting bloc that can stop extremists from weakening the Workers Republic or deforming it along a Maximist line. Niclas Y Glais has argued, however, that it was the potential for centralisation within the Union of Britain that allowed it to be vulnerable to Mosleyite manipulation. In order to avoid this Y Glais has formed the anarchist inclined Grwp made up of major figures in the farming unions. In a move that has shocked many within the WTUC the South Wales Miners Federation, which was until now lead by Griffiths, have formed a voting bloc behind the more extreme Jacobins within the WTUC; Harry Politt and S.O Davies arguing a strong state as described by Lenin is the only way to insure lasting freedom for the workers."

WAL_rad_soc_path:0 "Y Glais's Grwp"
WAL_rad_soc_path_desc:0 "Niclas Y Glais has been able to out-maneuver the more centrist candidates within the WTUC and takes the podium once again intent on leading Wales towards true workers control. Y Glais has explained he will structure Wales around a philosophy he describes as Rebeccarism, named after the Rebecca Riots and the revolutionary spontaneity they represented. Only time will tell if this philosophy yields the results Y Glais desires. Onward Workers of Wales!"
WAL_welsh_schools:0 "Welsh Language Schooling"
WAL_welsh_schools_desc:0 "Our language has too long been targeted for extinction by the English state. Even under syndicalist rule it has been woefully ignored and left to die. No more shall it languish! A Welsh nation should have Welsh first language schooling nationwide!"
WAL_union_power:0 "All Power To The Unions!"
WAL_union_power_desc:0 "Despite the syndicalist government in Westminster being purportedly run by the workers, unions have been too long at the mercy of the TUC. In our new Wales the WTUC shall not follow that model. The unions will dictate to the WTUC, not the WTUC to the unions."
WAL_democratic_military:0 "Democratize The Military"
WAL_democratic_military_desc:0 "While industry under syndicalism was empowered, the soldiers that defended our freedom have been all too often dictated to. It's time we truly democratise our armed forces. We will implement votes for officers and votes for interventions."
WAL_young_pioneers:0 "Arloeswyr Ifanc"
WAL_young_pioneers_desc:0 "To insure there is a Workers Republic for our grandchildren, our children must believe in this project. Founding the Ifanc Arloeswyr youth organisation will create a generation committed to socialism, willing to die for its preservation."
WAL_big_industry:0 "Communalize Heavy Industry"
WAL_big_industry_desc:0 "Heavy industry in Wales has been controlled by centralising unions like the South Wales Miners Federation. That may have been useful for organising against the state in the past but under true workers control this has become a power for centralisation and dictatorial rule. Each workplace shall be run by its community."
WAL_bangor_railway:0 "Transport In The Forgotten North"
WAL_bangor_railway_desc:0 "While South Wales has been built for the extraction of wealth from its many heavy industries, the north has languished. We must ensure this misdeed is duly corrected. Invest in northern infrastructure."
WAL_power_in_a_union:0 "There's Power In A Union"
WAL_power_in_a_union_desc:0 "Now we are finally free not just from those who would control labour, but from those who would use dictatorial power in labour’s name. Wales is republic for and by the workers!"

WAL_central_labour:0 "Jim Griffith's Central Federation Of Labour"
WAL_central_labour_desc:0 "As expected, the Central Federation of Labour has proved a centralising force in the WTUC drawing in representatives from both centralising and decentralising tendencies despite their differences. Our strong central force in the WTUC shall now set about rebuilding Wales in the legacy of John Maclean while also looking to the future for our nation. Onward Workers of Wales!"
WAL_maclean:0 "The Syndicalism Of Maclean"
WAL_maclean_desc:0 "Despite our differences the CFL can unite behind the model that John Maclean set out for us. We shall take inspiration in his work and lead Wales to socialism. We can create what Britain should’ve been in our corner of the isles."
WAL_cement_unions:0 "Cement The Power Of Unions"
WAL_cement_unions_desc:0 "It was all too easy for the Mosleyite traitors to undermine the power of the unions from Westminster. We will ensure this never happens again. Amend the constitution to ensure that unions cannot be dismissed and cement the power of the unions."
WAL_western_railway:0 "The Great Western Railway"
WAL_western_railway_desc:0 "For too long rail in Wales has been built with the purpose of extracting resources to England. Today we end that trend. A new rail project must begin linking the west coasts of Wales to the industrial and political heartlands of the south."
WAL_more_houses:0 "A Terraced House For Every Family"
WAL_more_houses_desc:0 "No family should be without shelter. Housing is a primary concern for the young republic, and we will see to it that no family goes without a place for them to live and thrive. Begin the building campaign, a terraced house for every family!"
WAL_support_farms:0 "Empower The Farming Communities"
WAL_support_farms_desc:0 "For a long time the industrial heartlands of Wales have followed the socialist current, but the farmers in the breadbasket of central and north Wales have often been left behind by the progress socialism has bought elsewhere. We shall provide them modern tools, infrastructure and socialist education to properly engage with the WTUC. "
WAL_big_mines:0 "Nationalize Mining And Steel"
WAL_big_mines_desc:0 "While the majority of those within the CFL are traditional syndicalists, there is a current within the bloc that tends towards centralisation. In order to maintain our majority in the WTUC and preserve peace in Wales that minority must be satisfied. Roll out nationalization programs for the mining and steel industries. "
WAL_what_could_have_been:0 "What Could Have Been"
WAL_what_could_have_been_desc:0 "Wales is on route to the prosperity we have always known possible. We have achieved the radical democracy espoused by Maclean. In Wales we have built what Britain could have been."

WAL_miners_federation:0 "Davies, Pollitt And The SW-Miners Federation"
WAL_miners_federation_desc:0 "To the surprise of everyone in the WTUC, the SWMF have been able to use the factional bickering between Y Glais and Griffiths to their advantage and have secured their majority in the WTUC. This represents a major shift in the politics of Wales, a shift toward Leninism. Onward, Workers of Wales!"
WAL_nationalize_industries:0 "Nationalize Major Industries"
WAL_nationalize_industries_desc:0 "Having all decision-making power devolved to industry level leaves us vulnerable to reactionaries in Wales and traitors in England. nationalising the major industries will allow us to coordinate the country for the betterment of the workers, while the workers still retain democratic control through the WTUC."
WAL_modernize_towns:0 "Modernize Mining Towns"
WAL_modernize_towns_desc:0 "While technology has come on leaps and bounds in recent years, unfortunately, very little of that has been seen by the average citizen outside of the workplace.

WAL_federation_aligned_reps:0 "Federation Aligned Representatives"
WAL_federation_aligned_reps_desc:0 "To reduce the likelihood of revolts similar to those that brought Mosley to power we need to ensure workers are invested in the new socialist construction and dedicated to the betterment of Wales. To ensure union representatives aligned to the SWMF need to be implemented to the workplace."
WAL_model_cities:0 "Le Corbusier's Model Cities"
WAL_model_cities_desc:0 "The new designs for Paris by Le Corbusier has piqued the interest of many within the WTUC. Not only would building projects based on his specifications solve our housing shortage, some also argue that the creation of model cities in this style could change the way citizens interact with their environments and each other, potentially creating the new socialist man."
WAL_improve_infrastructure:0 "Improve North/South Infrastructure"
WAL_improve_infrastructure_desc:0 "During the time of English rule, the North and the South of Wales were purposely separated by poor infrastructure as a form of divide and conquer tactic. If we want to integrate the North Welsh people into our new Socialist Wales, we just first give Wales the infrastructure it requires to properly function as a united nation."
WAL_socialist_education:0 "A Socialist Education"
WAL_socialist_education_desc:0 "For nearly a millennium the education of Welsh people has been decided by outsiders, sowing the seeds of imperialism and Welsh inferiority.

WAL_new_republic:0 "The New Worker's Republic"
WAL_new_republic_desc:0 "The restructuring of Wales is complete. By Lenin’s example we have formed a new republic where the worker is both free and secure in his freedom. Never again shall we be dominated. Long Live Lenin! Long Live Maclean!"

We should propose a union of Celtic Federative Socialist Republics to work towards our common future."
WAL_syndie_neutrality:0 "A Beacon Of Socialism Stands Alone"
WAL_syndie_neutrality_desc:0 "The only way to ensure that we remain independent is to avoid attaching ourselves to any supranational body. For too long Wales has followed the path that others set out for it and all too often that has led to good Welsh men dying. We bow to no one."
WAL_internationale:0 "Look Towards Europe"

WAL_celtic_tuc:0 "The Celtic TUC"
WAL_celtic_tuc_desc:0 "Now that our union is well established, we must fully integrate our nations so that the direction of the CFSR can be decided democratically. The Celtic TUC will be established integrating the congresses of all member nations. Solidarity Forever!"

WAL_argie_welsh:0 "The Patagonian Welsh"
WAL_argie_welsh_desc:0 "Long before we won our freedom a handful of our countrymen attempted to save our language and culture from the English oppressors.

It is important we build fraternal relations with our countrymen, especially given their socialist government is sympathetic to our cause."
WAL_shining_example:0 "A Shining Example Of Socialism"
WAL_shining_example_desc:0 "In our humble land we have built a shining example of socialism to be held up alongside the giants in our ranks. We should be more than proud of this crimson beacon we have lit for the world. Our light comes from the west and illuminates the whole world!"

WAL_purge_syndies:0 "Purge The Socialists"
WAL_purge_syndies_desc:0 "In order to prevent any further insurrection, it has been decided there is no safe way to allow anyone affiliated with the socialist cause to remain alive.

WAL_welsh_republican_army:0 "Establish The Welsh Republican Army"
WAL_welsh_republican_army_desc:0 "The structure of the Wales Home Rule Army suited an anti-state guerilla war, however it suits much less a uniform national army.

WAL_finding_allies:0 "Finding A Benefactor"

WAL_control_opposition_desc:0 "While it provides stability to have an opposition within the Senedd, it creates the opportunity for traitors like Jones to get close to the Flaenwr and gives them the means to organise.

WAL_president_for_life:0 "The Llywydd Tragwyddol"
WAL_president_for_life_desc:0 "Now we have consolidated our rule we cannot allow the power of our state to fall into the hands of those who would destroy Wales.

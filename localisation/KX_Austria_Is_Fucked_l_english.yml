#### Events ####

aus.1.t:0 "The Österreichische Ariosophische Einheitspartei Insults the Government!"
aus.1.d:0 "There is an influential far-right movement in our nation, the Österreichische Ariosophische Einheitspartei. It is extreme compared to the CS, and led by Lanz von Liebenfels. It has insulted our good country today, in the aftermath of Black Monday. It claims that it would do a far better job at recovering the economy than us, which is obviously an untrue statement.\nMany ÖAE members have protested the government today, advocating for ÖAE government officials, as we repress them. They only get more problematic by the day... we have to do something about them soon, no matter the cost."
aus.1.a:0 "They're seriously a problem."

aus.2.t:0 "The Österreichische Ariosophische Einheitspartei Wants to Participate in the Elections"
aus.2.d:0 "The ÖAE, having always been barred from participating in elections, requests with formality to be given a chance in the upcoming elections every cycle. Headed by Lanz von Liebenfels, an infamous racialist, occultist, Ariosophist, and former Chrstian monk of the Cistercian order, the ÖAE is an oddity in Austrian politics.\n\nThe basis of the party’s ideology is Ariosophy - a school of thought invented by Liebenfels that promotes Aryan purity as if they were chosen by God, and mixing Christian, Germanic Pagan, and holistic philosophies, this mystic movement seeks to prove that the Aryan soul - our Germanic soul - is the purest soul in existence. Furthermore, Ariosophy - sometimes called Theozoology - believes that the lower races of the Earth, as well as the disabled and deranged, should be bred out of existence, and prevented from procreating so that their genes die out. Additionally, Libenfels believes that through Aryan breeding initiatives, the total purity of the Germanic Aryan bloodline can be restored, regranting our people the paranormal powers of our demigod ancestors.\n\nTheir ultra-radical nationalist views, their oppressive and violent methods, and the overall threat they pose to our country makes them a guaranteed liability in any republican system. It's time we tell them the same thing."
aus.2.a:0 "Get out of here!"

aus.3.t:0 "The ÖAE Complains"
aus.3.d:0 "In the wake of our incoming denial that they could see coming from many kilometers away, the ÖAE has again taken to the streets to complain about our government. They whine and beg for participation in the general elections of 1936, which they obviously will not get. They only get worse by the day!"
aus.3.a:0 "Boo hoo, too bad."

aus.4.t:0 "ÖAE-Organized Riot!"
aus.4.d:0 "Instead of taking to the streets today, the ÖAE has taken the streets today in a riot spanning many cities and towns across Austria, all over the nation. Quite a staggering number of people came out to demonstrate in favor of the ÖAE, and as per usual, being violent and uncivil towards our law-abiding citizens. This has been the worst of the ÖAE in our history, and it's been discussed before to ban them, which has resurfaced in this time.\nWhat do we do about these crude rabblerousers?"
aus.4.a:0 "Lethal force engaged."
aus.4.b:0 "That's it! Ban their party!"

aus.5.t:0 "ÖAE-Organized Protest"
aus.5.d:0 "Yet again, the ÖAE has arrived in the streets to complain about our government, and asking to be in power again. Every time it gets worse - this one is no different. The worst in Austrian history, the ÖAE continues to get more powerful each year, no matter how hard the government tries to stop them. There's only one choice left to silence them - violence!"
aus.5.a:0 "Lethal force engaged."

aus.6.t:0 "Government official killed in broad daylight!"
aus.6.d:0 "A prominent official of ours has been killed in broad daylight by an unknown assailant. It's suspected that said assailant was a member of the ÖAE, attempting to make a point. All that the stupid assassin has done is driven his party more into the ground, as we'll be doing something about them soon."
aus.6.a:0 "How terrible!"

aus.7.t:0 "The [GetYear] Vienna Bombing"
aus.7.d:0 "Another braindead ÖAE terrorist has attempted to make an example of the "impures" by exploding a bomb in Vienna, toppling many buildings and blowing off a chunk of a government building. Indeed the casualties have been tallied, numbering around 32. Kaiser Karl has expressed great displeasure in the attack, and has condemned the ÖAE's actions. Lanz von Liebenfels has responded that he has not told the party to commit such horrible acts, and has denounced it as well."
aus.7.a:0 "How tragic! Send our condolences."

aus.8.t:0 "Demands from ÖAE Leader Lanz von Liebenfels"
aus.8.d:0 "Since their party is now banned, and unable to operate in any political office, Lanz von Liebenfels has demanded the unbanning of the party, "or else". Of course, the reason is a most laughable one, but it is very much plausible that his large support base would do something in his name shall he give the command. Do we fulfill Liebenfels's demands, or shall we shut him down just how we shut down his extremist party?"
aus.8.a:0 "Fine, fine! Allow them to operate."
aus.8.b:0 "Why don't you stay underground?!"

aus.9.t:0 "The Österreichische Ariosophische Einheitspartei Storms the Imperial Palace!"
aus.9.d:0 "It seems that the Österreichische Ariosophische Einheitspartei has been pushed over the edge! A legion of their armed contingent stormed the Imperial Palace today, guns blazing. It seems that the Viennese police were conspiring with Liebenfels in the attempt, as the police did not intervene in the shootout. After a tense few minutes..."
aus.9.a:0 "The ÖAE installs Liebenfels as Chancellor, resulting in Kaiser Karl becoming a figurehead!"
aus.9.b:0 "The attempt is halted by the guards!"

aus.10.t:0 "The SDAP Protests"
aus.10.d:0 "Our new government has attracted protest from the SDAP, who are restless due to their stolen government. After hearing accusations that we are taking measures to silence them, the SDAP has begun a large protest all over Austria. Some of the more radical protestors have hurt our police. Despite them being the minority, we know what must be done.\nIt really seems that protests are what's hot about now."
aus.10.a:0 "Shut it down... by force."

aus.11.t:0 "A Sermon to the Constituents"
aus.11.d:0 "Representatives from the Austrian Empire were given a speech to attempt to assuage their fears about Liebenfels's new, "radical" government. The representatives fidgeted with anger as we preached our esoteric Catholic way to them. As Liebenfels preached about Theozoology, the ‘ape-like’ races, and the necessity for Aryan purity, he was met with attentive stares. \nActually, wait, they don't look too happy. Oh, they're leaving the room. Oh no..."
aus.11.a:0 "Amen...?"

aus.12.t:0 "Anti-Austrian Revolution!"
aus.12.d:0 "The injustices committed against us time and time again by Liebenfels's evil government has reached a breaking point. Our people are sick of him - they are ready to fight him, through whatever means possible. As thousands sign up for the army, a wave of patriotism has swept across our nation, patriotism that clamors for freedom and the ceasing of the operation of the Liebenfels government.\nLiebenfels is well aware that this was on its way, and his armies are ready - it shall be a tough fight, but we shall perservere!"
aus.12.a:0 "Call on the Empire! Down with Liebenfels!"

aus.13.t:0 "Hungary Calls us to Arms"
aus.13.d:0 "Hungary's government has rebelled against Liebenfels's government, citing their numerous injustices and misdemeanors committed against them and even us. While they were the worst affected, many people do not believe there needs to be change, as they support the ÖAE themselves. Nevertheless, Hungary has called upon our nation to bring down Austria and execute Liebenfels once and for all. Do we stick with our old masters, or do we forge our own path?"
aus.13.a:0 "It's about time we did this!"
aus.13.b:0 "...We'd rather stay with Austria."

aus.14.t:0 "Pro-Kaiser Protest"
aus.14.d:0 "Booting the Kaiser out of emperorship has caused an eruption of anger in our nation, as many viewed him as the man who saved Austria. Signs are held, flags and banners are flown, and many other signs of an old order are waved around at our loyal police, who hold back the rage with a steady baton.\nThe Kaiser has supported the protests himself, denouncing Liebenfels as a tyrannical dictator who has stepped over his limits. It is without a doubt that the Kaiser must be dealt with."
aus.14.a:0 "Let's just exile him."

aus.15.t:0 "Liebenfels's Constitution"
aus.15.d:0 "The new Constitution of Austria has been put into effect today, giving Liebenfels supreme authority over Austria, and truly establishing Karl as a figurehead to maintain stability. It's hailed by the ÖAE, finally giving them what they need, but to everyone else, it effectively ends Austria's democratic system. To them, Austria is now an evil dictatorship. But to those who know the truth, we are merely doing what is necessary to build a pure, pious, and Aryan Austria"
aus.15.a:0 "We are doing what is best."

aus.16.t:0 "The Kaiser's Coup!"
aus.16.d:0 "The Kaiser hasn't taken kindly to our exile of him, and so he attempted to send in an armed contingent of his loyal soldiers to retake Austria from our good Liebenfels. The guards, having been told to stay on watch due to lurking scouts, subdued the soldiers with ease and found Karl not too far away. All of them were dragged away by the police, and what is known to the government is that Karl won't be having the privilege to a life very, very soon."
aus.16.a:0 "This is why we exiled you!"

aus.17.t:0 "Internal Radicalisation within the ÖAE"
aus.17.d:0 "Despite our radical nature, the core of our party centered around Liebenfels has always held far more extreme beliefs, being more openly and fully dedicated to the views espoused in Theozoology and Ariosophy. However, these more radical ideas have begun to mutate the minds of the feeble masses as they seep out from the core of the party. Some naive and misguided fools within the party have come to bastardize Liebenfels’ message, perverting his ideas and taking them to their absolute extremes. Dangerously, this once small group of dedicated Aryan occultists has now grown into a sizable minority within the party. To us, even they are evil, standing as a pack of mutated mongrels simply misinterpreting the will of Liebenfels and the Lord. The minority has already been outlawed by Liebenfels and sent underground, where hopefully nobody will find it. That is the real enemy of the people - radicalism like that. We are merely the bringers of good days."
aus.17.a:0 "It's a little too extreme for my tastes..."

aus.18.t:0 "Austrian Socialists Revolt!"
aus.18.d:0 "The complete destruction of the legislature, and cessation of its actions, has caused the SDAP to enter an enraged fury - every day there is loud yelling for change, loud yelling for the return to democracy. Today it only got one step worse, with the SDAP finally taking up arms in what they call a "restoration of order". Of course, it is without a doubt that what they are doing will only hurt Austria..."
aus.18.a:0 "You stupid SDAP sympathizer!"

aus.19.t:0 "Military Rallies"
aus.19.d:0 "The government has signed a document that allows for weekly displays of the military in random Austrian cities. The first one, which happened today, was obviously in Vienna. The citizenry watched as our highly-trained soldiers marched down the streets with perfect form, look, and speed. It was flawless, and surely everyone will take notice of how mighty the army really was.\nLong live our great Austria!"
aus.19.a:0 "How mighty!"

aus.20.t:0 "Unrestive Constituents"
aus.20.d:0 "The continued "radical" policies being passed by Liebenfels time and time again has had the liberty of seriously upsetting Hungary, and furthermore some representatives from other constituents. It is visible in meetings that Liebenfels attends - the glares of the officials as Liebenfels speaks passionately, the glares as he moves, and the lasers of the eyes tracked on him. They really don't like us."
aus.20.a:0 "It's for the greater good."

aus.21.t:0 "Constituent Officials Boycott Meetings"
aus.21.d:0 "The anger of the Constituents has reached the point to where they are actively refusing to meet. This means that Austria is essentially disunited, but still officially under Austria... They do not respond to anything except from "less radical" officials of the Liebenfels administration.\nWe are heading into the path of war, and there is not much we can or will do to stop it, since it is for the greater good."
aus.21.a:0 "That'll be a regrettable decision."

aus.22.t:0 "Constituent Officials Denounce Liebenfels"
aus.22.d:0 "Now they've done it! Those boycotters have finally officially denounced the Liebenfels administration, despite our knowledge that he is disliked abroad. Nearly every representative agreed with the speech, clapping, a thing that had not been done to Liebenfels's speeches."
aus.22.a:0 "And that will be your last mistake."

aus.23.t:0 "Slovenians Take Up Arms!"
aus.23.d:0 "After our "repeated misdemeanors" against the Slovene people, they have taken up arms against our rule. Their forces are small and inexperienced, so it should be a rather easy revolt to crush. Liebenfels has denounced the Slovene rebels, and states his intention to "do away" with all of them. The Slovenes wish for a return of the legislature that partially represents them, but Liebenfels has adamantly refused the recreation of a legislation.\n To Slovenia, we are the enemy. But really, it's everyone in our way, including them."
aus.23.a:0 "How tragic... for the Slovenes."

colnews.1.t:0 "The Austro-Hungarian Empire Combusts!"
colnews.1.d:0 "To anyone sheltered outside the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the sudden flood of instability may have been an astonishing and startling headline in the newspaper. It was anything but unexpected, though.\nThe Weltkrieg took an unprecedented toll on the once proud Austro-Hungarian Empire, and although they came out on top, with it came a great cost. The people were shattered, exhausted, and demoralized - unable to resist any opponents. The oncoming growth of the Österreichische Ariosophische Einheitspartei and Austrian Workers Union only furthered the nation's despair and plight, as the country turned against itself...\nThe constituents of the blighted Austrian Empire simultaneously shattered. From Tirol in Austria to Bukovina in Galicia, the Empire has taken up arms against their brothers, their citizens, their country - all in the name of freedom..."
colnews.1.a:0 "The Empire has decayed at last."
colnews.1.b:0 "We are lost..."
colnews.1.c:0 "The Bones of the Double Eagle set off alone."

POLITICS_LIEBENFELS_DESC:0 "Born under the name Adolf Josef Lanz, the man now known as Lanz von Liebenfels is one of the most unique heads of state in all of Europe. Born in 1874, Liebenfels was raised in Vienna in a middle class Austrian family, though he claims to be the son of Baron Johannes Lancz de Liebenfels - a ‘fact’ that has never been proven. Upon reaching adulthood, Liebenfels became a monk in the Cistercian order, assuming the name ‘Georg’ and living in Heiligenkreuz monastery. It was here in these holy walls where he claims to have reached enlightenment after finding the tombstone of a Knight Templar, kickstarting his dive into Aryan racial theory and esoteric theology, and causing his eventual expulsion from the Cistercian order.\n\nNot letting this setback keep him down, Liebenfels further developed his racial theories into the ideas of Ariosophy and Theozoology. Calling for the sterilization of what he calls the ‘ape-races,’ Liebenfels believes that the blue-eyed, blonde-hair Germanic Aryan-Christians are the greatest example of humanity in history, descended from paranormal and empowered demigods, and only losing their divinity over the centuries due to interracial breeding muddying their genes. To combat this egregious evolutionary mistake, Liebenfels seeks to use his party - the ÖAE or Österreichische Ariosophische Einheitspartei - as a platform to spread his Aryan message and bring about ‘racial demixing’ and the pious purification of Austria and the greater-Germanic lands - a mission that he will achieve no matter the cost, for neither courts nor Kaiser can keep him from his goal."

MNT_KING_MICHAEL_DESC:0 "King Michael I of house Petrović-Njegoš, King of Montenegro since 1929, was bestowed the crown by Danilo I, Crown Prince. Thus it fell to the young king to sort out the new, autonomous Montenegro and ensure its political integrity for years to come. A supporter of Montenegrin independence from Austria, the king found the prospect of independent Montenegro intangible, foreseeing the brutal suppression of the rebellions in the near future. With Serbia and other Slavic potential allies unable to assist Montenegro, Michael I signed the Treaty of Nikšić, granting Montenegro autonomy under the Habsburg crown, allowing Michael I to be crowned as King of Montenegro, the first since the end of the Weltkrieg.\nWhile his reign has been seen as a beacon of stability for Montenegro, the two nationalist People's Parties of Montenegro work with and against him, in an attempt to secure full Montenegrin independence. Michael I must tread the waters carefully, working with both the Serbs of the People's Party, and anti-Austrian Montenegrins of the True People's Party."

MNT_KING_MICHAEL_NPO_DESC:0 "King Michael I of house Petrović-Njegoš, King of Montenegro since 1929, was bestowed the crown by Danilo I, Crown Prince. Thus it fell to the young king to sort out the new, autonomous Montenegro and ensure its political integrity for years to come. A supporter of Montenegrin independence from Austria, the king found the prospect of independent Montenegro intangible, foreseeing the brutal suppression of the rebellions in the near future.

Michael I must tread the waters carefully, working with both the Serbs of the People's Party, and anti-Austrian Montenegrins of the True People's Party.\n\nBut, as of this moment, Michael I has found himself in an odd position: at the head of Drljević and Savić Marković Štedimlija's weird brand of nationalism. While the king disagrees with their theories of Montenegrin origins, a strong Montengro will raise a stronger people."

MNT_DRLJEVIC_DESC:0 "Perhaps mislabeled due to his ideological connections, Sekula Drljević was born on the sixth of September, 1884. Within the Montenegrin political scene, Drljević was a firm member of the Pravaši, fighting for Montenegrin independence from Belgrade. During the Austrian occupation of Montenegro, Drljević raised a guerilla group, the Montenegrin National Army, and made life for any Austrian soldier in the mountains hellish.\nAfter the Treaty of Nikšić and the resumption of Montenegrin independence, Drljević was silently hailed as a hero for driving out the Austrians. Greatly enlightened by the events over in their new "overlord," Drljević studied the works of Lanz von Liebenfels and Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, advancing a previously-unforeseen notion of the origin of Montenegrins. To Drljević, and his new right-hand-man Savić Marković Štedimlija, the Montenegrins were a Dinaric race descended from ancient Illyrians. Montenegrins are the purest of all Serbs, and to the fledgling Montenegrin national movement, it shall stay that way forevermore!"

MNT_POPOVIC_DESC:0 "Born on the thirteenth of September, eighteen eighty-one, Krsto Popović has long enjoyed the limelight of being Montenegro's most prominent military leader since the Weltkrieg. Having first earned medals in the Weltkrieg, Popović returned home a hero to his people but an enemy to his new state. Popović spent many years in hiding during the years of the Condominium, building a resistance along with other Montenegrins from scratch. Popović was instrumental in the Montenegrin Revolution during the South Slavic revolts, and his leadership united the disparate groups of Montenegrin Chetniks into one banner calling for Montenegrin freedom from Austria.\n\nPopović's actions in the war earned him great fame both at home and abroad, and he held the gradually-fracturing Chetnik coalition together until Independence Day. After the war, Popović's personal stance was that of maintaining cordiality with Austria, as he was staunchly against the idea of a Serbian Montenegro. Popović found political allies in Sekula Drljević and Savić Marković Štedimlija. Although disagreeing with their ethnic tale of Montenegro, Popović has triumphed as practically a single-manned military junta over Montenegro, forever loyal to his king and Montenegro."

MNT_DRAGUTIN_PRICA_DESC:0 "Dragutin Prica is mostly known for his tenure as a Croat-born Austro-Hungarian naval officer. During the South Slavic Revolts, Prica defected and joined the Illyrian revolutionaries, partially responsible for the command of the disparate naval forces of the rebels. After war's end, Prica was pardoned on the condition that he would assist the new Montenegrin state in the construction of their naval forces. Prica's job as admiral is a very quiet job, so much so that Dragutin Prica frequently remarks as having retired a long time ago, strange, when considered that his program of acquiring Austro-Hungarian vessels has proven incredibly successful."

MNT_dynastic_issues_desc:0 "The house of Petrović-Njegoš, while undisputed as the ruling house of the Kingdom of Montenegro, has been in open conflict with the People's Party, and furthermore the Serbian royal houses. The Serbian royals have been trying for decades, even preceding the Weltkrieg, to depose the ruling house of Petrović-Njegoš and emplace their own Serbian dynasty, seeing it as a threat to the now nearly extinct idea of Yugoslavism.\nEven with the answering of the Yugoslav question, Serbian monarchs still see Montenegro as easy access to the Mediterranean, making cooperation difficult."
MNT_serb_separatism:0 "Serb Separatism"
MNT_serb_separatism_desc:0 "Following the victory of the Central Powers over the Entente, and the subsequent partition and occupation of the Kingdoms of Serbia and Montenegro, Montenegro's two nationalist political parties, the People's Parties, have been at odds with each other trying to decide what to do with Montenegro. The People's Party sees Montenegrins as being Serbs from Serbia, while on the contrary, the True People's Party sees the Montenegrins as Serbs from Montenegro. Militant nationalists, meanwhile, following the brutal South Slavic Revolts, have occupied a large portion of Northern Montenegro, much to the displeasure of Austria and Montenegro themselves.\n These nationalist strongholds have been a serious thorn in both the Illyrian and Montenegrin sides."

#### Focuses ####

MNT_the_great_balancing_act:0 "The Great Balancing Act"
MNT_the_great_balancing_act_desc:0 "The year of 1936 dawns upon all nations great and small. Change and fervor is in the air; Austria's influence over the Balkans has found itself on a knife's edge. Their attention is turning inwards, to decisively solve the plague that afflicts their peoples.\nFor Montenegro, this means much: Austria holds Montenegro in a chokehold, even many years after the end of the Condominium. Now is the time to decide: shall we stay with Austria, or leave?"
MNT_treading_carefully:0 "To Tread Carefully"
MNT_treading_carefully_desc:0 "The Klubaši, led by Andrija Radović, is one of two major political blocs in Montenegro. They and the Bjelaši, basically one and the same, view the primary issue of our nation as such: the Montenegrins are a Serbian people from Serbia. While unpopular in the royal house, the merits come from improved relations with Balkan brothers, besides Bulgaria, and the opportunity to expand westwards or southwards if we so desire. Aligning with the Pravaši is to follow the Slavic drum."
MNT_old_pravasi_friends:0 "Trust the Pravaši"
MNT_old_pravasi_friends_desc:0 "The Pravaši, led by a myriad of different figures, finds a different solution to the primordial problem of the nation: Montenegro is made of Serbs from Montenegro. A more radical half, the Zelenaši, fought in the South Slavic revolts as Anti-Austrian and Anti-Serbian guerillas. Once Austria promised support of the royal house, the luck of the Zelenaši changed - and they view Montenegro as a Montenegrin people from Montenegro. The Pravaši may alienate us from all around, but it may yet still provide us the most bright future of Montenegro, lest we step on nobody's shoes."
MNT_independence_and_cordiality:0 "Independence and Cordiality"
MNT_independence_and_cordiality_desc:0 "It has become evident, that even in such an upheaval as Black Monday, nothing has really changed. Even with the ability to switch our course, what we have now is the best solution. We are defended by a great power and rake in a good portion of profits off their business; why should we isolate ourselves with weaker allies, if we have almost nothing to gain from Austria?"
MNT_export_bauxite_stash:0 "Red Bauxite Shipping"
MNT_export_bauxite_stash_desc:0 "Montenegro's mineral industry is primarily bauxite - red bauxite. A necessary component in the aluminum industry, Austrian mines constructed during the Condominium era have been nationalized following the withdrawal of many investments. A very profitable sector of the economy, the mines must continue to operate and be expanded: if the signs Europe points to are true, then Montenegrin aluminum will be a deciding factor on tomorrow's home and war front."
MNT_expand_the_sawmills:0 "Sawmills of the Woodlands"
MNT_expand_the_sawmills_desc:0 "Northern Montenegro is covered in a weighted blanket of woods. With a growing demand of wood at home to assist in the numerous construction programs ongoing to combat Black Monday, new sawmills and lumberyards must be erected around the countryside. As many northerners are also majorly affected by the crash in the South, these programs will assist in providing jobs to the unemployed of the region."

With political upheaval in the wake of Black Monday washing up on the shores of almost every Mediterranean nation, it is imperative we secure a few ships for the sole purpose of disassembling. With this, we may teach the first generation of Montenegrin naval commanders how their steed works."

MNT_third_great_danubian_port_desc:0 "Podgorica has risen up as a vital seafaring route through the Adriatic. As our facilities have been expanded by the influx of krone investment in the past few years, Podgorica has been transformed into a major regional shipping port. Materials from Serbia are passed through here with a heavy tax to make both of us an extra bit of cash. Podgorica's importance in the Adriatic must be upheld and even consolidated, for the more ships that pass under the gaze of the Petrović-Njegoš house is another thousand more krones to ourselves."
MNT_mobilize_for_action:0 "No Negotiating with Terrorists"
MNT_mobilize_for_action_desc:0 "Life in most of Montenegro is quiet and peaceful, but the North can only seldom fit into the category of the Montenegrin norm. The underlying reason is simply because of radical Serbian elements hiding in mountain outcrops, bitter at their unsuccessful coup attempts during the South Slavic Revolts. Serb guerillas attempted to seize the state as a gift to Serbia, but Austro-Montenegrin forces nullified that pipe dream.\n\nWe will shut the pipe for good and flood it with rat poison; each second more they gorge on our instability, the worse tomorrow shall be."

To make sure the goblins never arrive on our doorstep, we must construct a wall of coin - and we've found two willing participants. Bulgaria and Albania, each either eyed by or eyeing Serbia, may be open for a deal. A road will be paved through them, partially funded by all of us, along with a trade agreement."

MNT_montenegrin_domestic_minerals_desc:0 "Even as a major producer of European bauxite, Montenegro has one more trick up its sleeve - iron. Iron is one of the most necessary minerals in all things manufacturing, so it is only obvious that we begin to extract our own.

MNT_prospect_for_coal_desc:0 "Elektroprivreda Crne Gore stands as one of the most profitable countries in Montenegro. With help from the krone during the time of the Condominium, ECG was subject to a boom. Their appliances, along with Austrian ones, began to be entrenched into the life of the normal Montenegrin. Today, their appliances shall staff the lights of our new mines, the sawblades of our new mills, and the cars of tomorrow's roadways."
MNT_macroeconomic_reform:0 "Macroeconomic Adjustment Act"
MNT_macroeconomic_reform_desc:0 "Our economy must now be overhauled at its core: for far too long, Montenegro has been an agrarian nation.

This means we are politically isolated on the world stage, which is dangerous for a small nation like ours in such a volatile region like the Balkans.To help establish new ties to the great powers both in Europe and across the seas we shall open our port Podgorica to all, no matter their political leanings. Some say this is dangerous but to survive we must take such risks."
MNT_defense_if_needed:0 "Armed Necessities Act"
MNT_defense_if_needed_desc:0 "Our new nation is defended by a miniscule army, though it is more like a militia than anything. To secure our borders we must expand the Army drastically and do so we shall pass the Armed Necessities Act that will divert funds from other projects into the military. This might have drawbacks to some economic and social sectors but none of our funding will matter no matter where it goes if some upstart state overruns us."

MNT_prioritize_montenegrin_companies_desc:0 "We are a poor people, neglected by all those who have ruled us. Now we are independent we can finally put Montenegrin money back into Montenegro. Our financial advisors have advised us that the most cost effective way to magnify our investments is investing in local business. This holds obvious merit so we shall begin to offer low cost loans to any and all businesses that need them. The money we put into these businesses then can be trickled down to the common man."

Now that we are free we cannot allow the Kaiser to have such leverage over us any more. We will begin to phase out the krone and reintroduce the perper at a new fixed rate for now. With this we will sever another tendril of Austrian influence."

MNT_overwrite_austrian_companies_desc:0 "Our economy is dominated by Austrian businesses. These flagrant monopolies have all but strangled our local businesses in their cradle. We must decide what to do about them. Some suggest nationalizing them and cutting them up then selling them off. This would cut yet another foothold the Austrians have in our nation and give control of our economy back to ourselves. However, some caution against this saying it could easily backfire catastrophically and worsen the economic situation. Instead they suggest that we let the Austrians continue to operate but with harsher regulation to allow for local business growth. What are we to do?"

MNT_bribe_serbs:0 "Placate the Klubaši"
MNT_bribe_serbs_desc:0 "The Klubaši, or Peoples Party, have not taken kindly to our reforms. They see our state, their state, as an abomination. They continue to push for our integration into Serbia. However, they are people just like us and just like us are vulnerable to gifts. In return for them not too loudly we will focus some investment in their strongholds. This obvious bribe will surely boost their chances in future elections, some warn, and if they take over then Montenegro’s days are numbered. Not only that but it might even embolden the Serb terrorists who plague the north of the country. However independence is fraught with risks, what is one more among thousands?"
MNT_podgorica_seaport:0 "The Podgorica Seaport"
MNT_podgorica_seaport_desc:0 "Our main harbor, the Podgorica Seaport, has become a trading hub along the Adriatic recently. Ships from America to Bombay stop to unload cargo and take more on. The sheer number of ships along with their increasing size has laid bare just how small the port is. If our meteoric economic growth is to continue we must expand it, so emergency modifications have been authorized for the port so it can accommodate more ships and bigger ships that continue to flow through."
MNT_lead_and_zinc:0 "Probe the Brskovo Mine"
MNT_lead_and_zinc_desc:0 "The Brskovo mine has been a rich source of lead and zinc for years now. However, recent surveys have indicated there might be still more veins that remain to be tapped. We have already been bombarded with requests to find these untapped veins and begin to mine them as well and we have little reason to oppose them."
MNT_northeast_livestocks:0 "Rapprochement with Berane Ranchers"
MNT_northeast_livestocks_desc:0 "The north of our country is crawling with Serbian terrorists who seek to destroy our nation as their long term goal. In the short term they have terrorized the landowners of Berane, stealing food and killing and burning livestock and crops. This has bred nothing but ill will between the victims and the government, who they see as doing nothing to stop this. In that sense they are right, we have done nothing to counter these terrorists. However we must get these landowners back on side if we are to maintain power and most importantly, prosperity. We shall meet these landowners and hear their concerns and address them in the best way we can."

MNT_business_of_balkans_desc:0 "We are making money hand over fist. Trade is exploding across the nation and prosperity is slowly bringing us to a new standard of living unheard of just a decade before. We have been approached as an economic neutral ground for various Balkan states who officially hate each other but must still deal with each other. This reputation could mean big for us not only economically, but ensure our security as a Switzerland of the Balkans."

MNT_appeasing_northern_serbs_desc:0 "Serbs of the North have long found themselves disillusioned with Podgorica and its nationalist ideals. With the Pravaši cast aside and the Zelenaši the underdog, it is high time to repair our relationship with the North Serbs. The North Serbs have traditionally been more pro-Belgrade than the rest of the nation; the simple fact of our victory has already proven an essential start. We must make good, and unite beach and peak."
MNT_set_boundaries:0 "Draw Lines of Law"
MNT_set_boundaries_desc:0 "Boundaries must be set around the nation; while are army is usually touted as "oversized," its efficiency in subduing any upstart rebel leaders is subpar at best. While, fortunately, our nation is in a rather stable state, especially compared to Austria, Serbia, or Germany, we cannot rely on this luck for too long. The army must be supplied from home, and its borders defended."

MNT_adopt_the_dinar_desc:0 "Currently, the Montenegrin state currency is the Austro-Hungarian krone. With the crashing and burning of the entire sphere's economy in the wake of Black Monday, the Klubaši has called into question the practical use of continuing krone support; to them, the less-affected Serbian dinar would do better, and serve as a symbol of Serb unity between Podgorica and Belgrade."

MNT_kick_out_austrians_desc:0 "Despite most Austrian businessmen having packed their bags themselves, some major businesses still poke and prod us, looking for where best to infect our nation with the Habsburgs' will. Austrian businesses must pack their bags and leave immediately, for Montenegro no longer has a place for them - our future is in our own hands, and not at the whims of a Germanic capitalist pig some hundred kilometers away."
MNT_some_necessity:0 "Evils Are Guaranteed..."
MNT_some_necessity_desc:0 "Even if Austrian businessmen have left, the crown jewels of Austria and Hungary continue to shine, visible even from Berane. Their influence, while diminished, remain astute at the inner workings and situation of the Black Mountain. Given the fact of their detestment towards Belgrade, it would be obvious that a betterment in relations between Belgrade and Podgorica would draw Austrian ire, and we may find ourselves back in a Condominium rather than a Kingdom. Austria's support has their benefits, and we must use them wisely - it would be a tragedy to be at the receiving end of the Kaiser's military reforms."

Many more may find an interest in our Serbian people, the picturesque mountains, the food and the fisheries; but there is one who shall never once step another foot onto Montenegrin soil. They are the Habsburgs, the rulers of Austria. Austria has absolutely no place for anything Montenegrin anymore, and the Condominium shall never be a threat, rather a war cry, a lesson to the Montenegrin of tomorrow. Our future lies elsewhere, somewhere beyond the reach of yellow and black tentacles."

MNT_export_mineral_stashes_desc:0 "During the Austro-Hungarian economic boom of the late 1920s, the Adriatic Sea was awash with the sigils of Danubian vessels, many of which were Montenegrin vessels bound for Trieste or Austrian vessels bound for Podgorica. We stand at the Strait of Otranto, and lucrative trade still lies in the Adriatic; even if Black Monday has broken many a coin, our vessels still have a place within the ports of Trieste, Venice, Zadar, and Fiume."

Historically a poor agricultural region, times have changed, and a bright sun dawns in the far distance.

MNT_a_new_community_desc:0 "The past few years have been a tumultuous time for Montenegro. From a Condominium, to a closely-inspected pseudo-satellite state, to finally a fiercely independent nation unleashed. The Mother Serb shall smile brightly from above, knowing her children have succeded - and true to her wishes, Montenegro will continue to prosper. With ties in Serbia reaffirmed and the Austrians at bay for now, it is time to turn our attention to the dark storm clouds hanging over the West."

MNT_crnogorska_navy:0 "More i Mornari"
MNT_crnogorska_navy_desc:0 "The Montenegrin has a short and uninteresting history behind it, barely finding use during the Weltkrieg. Its prominence began during the time of the Condominium, and today Montenegro's navy is similarly oversized, just like its army; we have found ample solution, and our nation remains heavily militarized as a result. The navy must continue to modernize, as these Austrian models will become outdated soon."
MNT_surface_dwellings:0 "Surface Fleet"
MNT_surface_dwellings_desc:0 "Destroyers, cruisers, battleships: these are the trademarks of the surface-faring fleet.

MNT_submarine_investiture:0 "Prowl the Adriatic"
MNT_submarine_investiture_desc:0 "While most of our attention is to the slightly-out-of-date Austrian surface fleet that bears the banner of Montenegro, we have a second factor to exploit. Montenegro currently owns four state-of-the-art U-Boats from Austria. These vessels are mostly used in the subversion of the rowdy Adriatic Pirates that are sometimes sighted near the Albanian waters. Normally, though, our submarines are just patrol boats - so we must drill them for combat readiness."

MNT_adriatic_sea_use:0 "Lock off the Otranto Strait"
MNT_adriatic_sea_use_desc:0 "In the case of armed conflict, the Otranto Strait must be locked down. Both to protect us and attack the enemy, the Strait must be closed off by our fleet, small as may be; the objective is to stop convoy and warship movement. The U-Boats we wield shall be the sharks under the waves, for the Strait shall never fall without at least a dozen enemies sank."
MNT_adriatic_warships:0 "Cruiser Squadrons"
MNT_adriatic_warships_desc:0 "The Adriatic is our most vital lifeline - without it, much of the successes we are building will end up all for naught. Thus it is necessary that our navy must be able to respond to any nearby threat with immediacy and effectiveness; the loss of the port of Bar is the loss of our balancing bar, and without it, Montenegro will topple."

MNT_royal_montenegrin_army_desc:0 "The Montenegrin Army is considered incredibly oversized for the resources of our nation. But, as we sit on a large stockpile of Austrian weaponry procured both by advantageous deals and veteran equipment from Illyrian Chetnik units, Montenegro has no arms shortage. The army may be on the risk of falling behind its neighbors soon, though, as we stall in peace while others hone their bayonets in battle. This must not happen!"

MNT_bolster_the_police_desc:0 "Montenegro is, for the most part, stable - that is, besides the guerilla groups that threaten our government.

MNT_reintroduce_conscription:0 "Standardize Chetnik Veterans"
MNT_reintroduce_conscription_desc:0 "The Chetnik veterans of the South Slavic revolts now live as disorganized guerilla bands or have reintegrated into society. Some have pursued higher places, but the fact of the matter is that they will serve us well. With no shortage of combat expertise on fighting a stronger enemy, it may be a necessity to standardize these Chetniks into proper army units. While non-guerilla warfare may not be their specialty, these Chetnik units will have higher autonomy."

MNT_pacify_serbs_desc:0 "The most radical elements of pro-Serbian unification lies in the north of our country. Many of these holed-up dissidents are radical elements of the Bjelaši, who denounce terrorist actions of these radicals.

MNT_adopt_standard_motorized:0 "Standardized Motors"
MNT_adopt_standard_motorized_desc:0 "Montenegrin motor vehicles are a hodgepodge of Austrian, Illyrian, Hungarian, Serbian, and even Bulgarian car manufacturers and their engines. Unfortunately, these are incompatible - while not a problem for civilians, it's a huge issue to the military.

MNT_rangers_desc:0 "Being a heavily forested nation, why haven't we formed a ranger battalion yet? It must be our lack of money, but today, we have a good surplus to spare - we will train our soldiers flly in forest and all manners of leafy combat and traversing."
MNT_standard_weapons:0 "Requisition Austrian Weaponry"
MNT_standard_weapons_desc:0 "Austrian arsenals have been responsible for the majority of Montenegrin arms over the last few decades. We still have a sizeable amount of their equipment on hand, too - we will disassemble the rifles, study them, and reverse-engineer to make our own standard weapons."
MNT_armor_works:0 "Armored Venture"
MNT_armor_works_desc:0 "Tanks and Montenegro sounds counterintuitive - rocky, unforgiving terrain, and thick groves of woods. However, armored technology has only advanced since the clumsy tractors of the Weltkrieg, and many predict that the tank could be the deciding factor between victory and loss. Montenegro will form its first tank regiments, with whatever we have - and they shall be instrumental in any further military operations."

MNT_crnogorska_airforce_desc:0 "Montenegro has no official air force - it's time to change that!

MNT_coastal_patrol_airforce:0 "Maritime Aircraft"

MNT_cas_doctrine_desc:0 "Our current ideas regarding close air support is merely a catchall for supporting the army. How should this be done? When? Why?

MNT_dioclea_question:0 "The Dioclean Query"
MNT_dioclea_question_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the strangest recent ideas to come out of politics, the Dioclean Question was first proposed by Kaiser Karl I during the Weltkrieg.

mntintro.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of Montenegro, circa 1936"
mntintro.1.d:0 "Having fought on the side of the Entente Powers during the Weltkrieg, the Kingdom of Montenegro was defeated by Austro-Hungarian and Bulgarian troops. Its independence was ended with its annexation to the Austro-Hungarian Empire as the Condominium of Montenegro. The Condominium was tightly controlled by Austro-Hungarian military affairs, intended to be incorporated into the blossoming Illyrian idea - but as fate would have it, this hope for the Habsburgs was dashed with the eruption of the South Slavic Revolts.\n\nStill bitter at their loss during the Weltkrieg, Montenegrin Zelenaši and Bjelaši, or Greens and Whites, initially fought on the same side together. With the formation of new guerilla Chetnik units, supported by disgrunted Serbian officers, Austro-Hungarian authorities were quickly routed out of the territories of the old Kingdom. In line with tradition, Montenegro declared independence on the thirteenth of July 1928.\n\nThe Zelenaši and Bjelaši, now roughly the Pravaši and Klubaši respectively, turned their weapons on each other in a brief Montenegrin Civil War over the issue of Serbian annexation. The Pravaši won due to decisive Austro-Bulgarian support, but by the time Montenegro was solidifying, the Austrians had marched back into Sarajevo and re-annexed Bosnia.\n\nWith Montenegrin independence under threat once more, Montenegro offered fealty to Vienna under the clause that Prince Michael Petrović-Njegoš could be crowned King of Montenegro, without any blood spilt. The proposal was accepted. De jure, Montenegro is the only independent nation fully inside the Habsburg sphere besides Liechtenstein, but de facto, Austria still controls many facets of Montenegrin politics.\n\nThe issues of yesterday still haunt Montenegro, though - its economy is almost entirely dependent upon Austro-Illyrian trade and companies. Its north is occupied by Serb separatists, a radical element of the Klubaši reminiscent of the Bjelaši. Radicalized red Chetniks, resistance fighters instrumental in the South Slavic Revolts, hide amongst the populace - and as Serbia slowly regains its footing, the old house of the Zelenaši radicalizes further and further. If Montenegro is to succeed in the twentieth century, it must rein in all the unraveling ends."

With the withdrawal of Austrian forces all over Serbia and Montenegro, so too have tensions been inflamed here; the Crvenaši and the Bjelaši, sidelined by Vienna in heavy favor of the Zelenaši, have already begun making moves.\n\nThe future is uncertain for Montenegro, but the King shall decree our path!"

Times and priorities have changed, though; Michael I Petrović-Njegoš is not so keen on allowing the Serb king to return to exile unpunished.

Once the cavalcade was stopped, the bushes sprang to life - and the royal guards immediately opened fire against the guerilla assassins.\n\nAbout twenty minutes later, with the King and his wife safely extracted from the firefight with minor wounds, the dead were tallied - three royal guards and ten assassins. \n\nWith links to the Black Hand discovered, Alexander was furiously approached by the King.

Earlier in the day, Popović had expressed to many Montenegrin officers that he could not, in good faith, serve a Serbian who sought to destroy everything Montenegrin. Following him, many more junior officers have given up their posts.\n\nAs for us, this is highly worrying - a mass exodus of talented commanders could easily find their way into an armed uprising, easily that of the Zelenaši. Some have proposed a forced suicide of Popović, but no ideas have come to fruition. It is simply a fact of the matter that Popović and many other commanders are resigning in face of a currently unpopular administration."

Austrian investors, long a staple of the advancement of the Montenegrin economy, have suddenly pulled out in an effort to save even a few krones in the long term. While perhaps beneficial to these floundering businessmen, it is nothing but bad news for us - our economy has entered a slump that threatens to send our economy back by decades.\n\nThere is a silver lining, though - with all the closure of Austrian businesses and the rise in unemployment, it is possible to nationalize the remaining surviving Austrian holds and now-abandoned firms. Either that, or we can keep the status quo there. By nationalizing Austrian assets, no doubt the Kaiser will be upset; but what is he to do?"

Two obvious viewpoints have emerged: soothe the fires, or crack down on it in an effort to preserve what little we have left.\n\nFerries between our islands have been entirely halted as well, along with any sort of boat construction projects. The laborers' unrest is built upon the reduction of wages following loss of assets and rising layoffs in accordance with necessity. The idea that Syndicalist revolt dawns upon Montenegro may have been laughable then; but now, it isn't."

They made up the smallest portion of 'politicized' Chetnik  units formed for the liberation of Montenegro, yet played important roles in the defense of western Montenegro.\n\nOur government has introduced of a policy of 'standardizing' still-willing Chetniks from all sides of Montenegro, schooling them in the ways of traditional warfare mixed with their comfortable guerilla campaign. A few nails have been driven over, though; what to do with the Crvenaši? Some worry that their training may lead to revolution, or spread the red gas throughout the training camps. On the other hand, the Crvenaši are valuable soldiers, with a steely resilience that rivals none other. Do we permit the Crvenaši chetniks into the program, or purposefully exclude them?"

Having learned French, German, English, and Italian with a profound fluency, Max Mijušković has been employed in the government secret agencies, working to decipher enemy communiqués both internal and external. His knowledge in German has made him an important link to ties with Austria and Germany as well. However, most notable is his focus on the Crvenaši, and his efforts have unearthed a whole trove of collusion between the Third Internationale and the disparate Crvenaši supporters.\n\nFrom arms deals to monetary support, it is no wonder the Crvenaši have made such a big step forward with the Internationale support of this worldwide revolution. However, Mijušković's work has earned him hefty praise from all manners of military, and the Crvenaši's influence has taken a large hit as a result of our new knowledge."

mnt.19.t:0 "Death of Lazar Mijušković"
mnt.19.d:0 "Lazar Mijušković, long an influential figure in the political scene of Montenegro, has passed away due to natural causes today. A devoted supporter of the Petrović-Njegoš dynasty, Mijušković was the driving force for why Montenegrin politics is where it is. Mijušković's work prevented the newly-independent Montenegro, after the fall of the Condominium, from falling to the Zelenaši or Bjelaši; rather, he resurrected the old Pravaši and, by coordination, the Klubaši, although that was not his doing.\n\nPrime minister since independence, his early years as this long term of prime ministery focused on strengthening the identity of the Montenegrins and their geopolitical position on the world stage. His admittedly expected passing has opened a rift that has been cracking very quickly since the withdrawal of Austrian assets in Black Monday. The nation mourns the death of such an able-minded man; may his Montenegro honor his sacrifice and all he yearned for."

The North, while not explicitly so, has long been beheld as a 'separatist region' due to being the go-to hiding place for extremists of all ends of the political spectrum. This area, also much more separated from the major cities of Cetinje and Podgorica, have not been so thoroughly 'Montenegrinized' as places like Berane. The Klubaši's victory might bring a swift end to what was once perceived as a dire issue in Montenegro by works of compromise, something even Pravaši and Zelenaši elements are willing to lend a hand towards."

mnt.21.d:0 "Fortune favors the bold goes the saying. During the Weltkrieg, many thousands of soldiers perished to machine gun fire and terrible, hellish conditions. Some heroes, though, scraped together what they could out of muck and grime.\nOne such hero is Joko Meštrović, also known as John Mestrovich. Serving in the Weltkrieg thanks to Montenegro's entry into the war, Meštrović served on the Macedonian front of the war following the fall of Montenegro, working with the Serbian divisions. \n\nSurviving the war and returning to America bitter at the annexation of Montenegro, Meštrović jumped at the chance to serve in the South Slavic Revolts. Here he earned the Obilić Medal for single-handedly disarming an Austrian machine gun nest bunkered in a hill. For this, in 1930, during a visit to Montenegro after its liberation, Meštrović was caught by police and referred to the King, who presented him with the Obilić Medal.\n\nLastly, today, unfortunately, a coffin came to our shores from the sea - and in it laid Joko Meštrović. As his last great stunt in the war, Meštrović saved his captain's life during a shootout in the western United States. [USA.GetLeader] has given Meštrović the Medal of Honor posthumously, the highest military order in the United States.\n\nWhile, in the grand scheme of things, unremarkable, Joko Meštrović will be remembered by many as a prime example of Montenegrin soldiery."
mnt.21.a:0 "May he rest in peace."

mnt.22.t:0 "A Monument to the Chetniks"
mnt.22.d:0 "As our nation's independence is largely thanks to well-supplied and highly-efficient guerilla forces, monuments have been popping up all over the country. From grand displays Trebjesa in Nikšić to quaint, silent acknowledgement of Montenegro's finest hour at Podgorica, the nation knows what the Chetniks are owed. As we draw further into our second decade independent, Montenegro's Chetniks and Partisans have practically silently reintegrated into the countryside.\n\nMany of these honorable soldiers go forgotten, unrecorded by commanders. A new monument is to be constructed in Cetinje to honor these men specifically; those who fought but never had their names make it back home. Many soldiers who perished in the South Slavic revolts were buried at the national tomb in a section warded off from the dead of the Weltkrieg."

mnt.23.d:0 "A trope oft recurring in history is that of rebellion and revolution; it seems that people are willing to take any kind of punishment until their very life runs out: food and money. For Austria, this was nearly the case a little over two decades ago with the Weltkrieg. As Black Monday has instantly corroded the Austrian gears of progress, many citizens are approaching unrest and the collapse of the Empire looks like a real possibility once more.\n\nAs for us, Austrian military police and other army organizations have pulled out from Montenegro in order to better protect its inner borders. This, essentially, means that we have our true freedom from Austria at long last."

In our newfound true independence where the banner of the Petrović-Njegoš rises over that of the black and yellow double eagle at long last, we must ask ourselves the primordial question: what now? The Bjelaši has found its answer: as Serbia has at long last been given breathing room, the possibility that Montenegro and Serbia unite once and for all has once more wound its dark chords into the tainting voices of pro-annexation Chetniks and politicians alike. Thus, they have rearmed and taken to the streets. Nothing has happened, but the possibilities portrayed are endless."

Thus, they have reiterated their loyalty to Montenegro and have proposed an election and plebiscite to work out the changes that the new Montenegro shall make unto itself and others. The Pravaši, for its part, has a surprisingly diverse reaction. Some say to hold the election, as it will give ourselves a true look upon ourselves.

However, there has been increasing opposition to these diplomatic efforts in the form of leftist opposition; both party leaders and trade unionists alike have claimed that we have betrayed their efforts for workers’ rights and an independent state to become nothing more than an Austrian lapdog.

Organizations from both the right and the left, villagers and urbanites alike, believe it to be an obstruction of the sovereignty of the state of Montenegro. Discontent has been raised within the morning newspapers and in commons across the country, cursing the Klubaši in what rapidly became protests as they took to the streets to demonstrate their opposition - no doubt fostered by the Zelenaši and other dissidents. General unrest has overtaken the country, and militia commanders loyal to the party are debating whether to intervene with brute force, while members of the parliament loyal to the party have attempted to deescalate the unrest."

mntflavor.18.d:0 "Politics in Montenegro is fickle; its three main forces are named after colors. These three are white, green, and red. Thus, Montenegro and its politics is frequently represented as a Christmas tree, interactions between the three joked as such. But who are the Bjelaši, Zelenaši, and Crvenaši, and what is their importance to our nation?\n\nThe Bjelaši and Zelenaši, the two most pre-eminent forces, are closely related to the Klubaši and Pravaši respectively. Hailing from the South Slavic Revolts, an impromptu assembly was held in Chetnik-occupied Podgorica, attempting to fuse our briefly independent state with Serbia. Voting cards were issues with green and white paper, white to the pro-Serbian members and green to the pro-Independence.\nNot only did the Greens, or Zelenaši, win out, but Serbia was wholly unwilling to accept the annexation in the first place.\nWhen Montenegro regained a sense of independence following the Treaty of Nikšić, the Zelenaši and Bjelaši were rapidly rendered obsolete by the return of the Pravaši and Klubaši respectively. The Zelenaši and Bjelaši, thus, became known as the 'military detachments' of these two parties, for Chetniks had much prominence in the ranks of both. Where the Pravaši and Klubaši fight with speeches and majority decisions, the Zelenaši and Bjelaši operate as tools of blood and iron for their belief.\n\nThe Zelenaši, compared to the Bjelaši, is much stronger - supported by major military officials in the army, most notably Krsto Popović. The Bjelaši's main advantage lies in intricate knowledge of the northern Dinaric Alps, where support for Serbian union is the strongest.\nAll in all, two impromptu factions have become military tools of two political parties that believe the same thing."
mntflavor.18.a:0 "Eternal be our Montenegro!"

mntflavor.19.t:0 "The Ornament"
mntflavor.19.d:0 "The Crvenaši is a minor yet emerging faction within Montenegrin society. Spearheaded by Blazo Jovanović, the Crvenaši has found much appeal within Montenegrin youth - left unchecked, a Montenegro in ten years could be at a serious risk of socialist revolution. However, today, this is not the case.\n\nNot named after a voting card, the Crvenaši got its name simply from the Bjelaši and Zelenaši; white, green, and red! The Crvenaši's role in the South Slavic Revolts and the subsequent end of the Montenegrin Condominium is minor: Jovanović preferred neither Zelenaši nor Bjelaši goons. The Crvenaši boasts well-educated leaders and commanders, making their future bright if they ever manage to subvert the status quo.\n\nThey owe these successes to the Third Internationale and the Trans-Alpine Strikes. While the Strikes had nearly no effect on Montenegro itself, the results seen in Austria deeply inspired Jovanović and many other now-Crvenaši leaders.\nAs for the Third Internationale, it is no secret of their desire to spread the revolution: the Crvenaši is ready to support the red tide wherever it may wash. Internationale funds find their way into Montenegro through Southern Italy, which is used to ferry arms for more radical sides. As these caches are hidden deep in the mountains, there is little the government may do - so the Crvenaši bide their time, waiting to strike."

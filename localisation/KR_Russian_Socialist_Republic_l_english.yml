SOV_totalist_party_long:0 "Rossiyskaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya               §gThe Russian Communist Party emerged from a left-wing group of Bolsheviks, that were against Bukharin. The RKP, led by Zinoviev, supports orthodox Marxism-Leninism, collectivisation, rapid industrialisation and is strongly opposed to Bukharin's market socialism. The RKP is banned in Russia, but they still retain a solid following. They may see an opportunity to take power if the situation in the country radically changes.§!"
SOV_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Partiya Levykh Sotsialistov-revolyutsionerov             §gThe Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries is the main syndicalist party in Russia. It split from the PSR in 1917 to support the Bolshevik revolutionaries. However, the Left SRs came to oppose the Bolsheviks and their extremist tendencies. After the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War, the Left SRs consolidated their power as a true syndicalist force, taking inspiration from the successful syndicalist revolution in France. The party promotes revolutionary syndicalism based on voluntary association of autonomous labor collectives and trade union cooperatives.§!"
SOV_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Narodnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya              §gThe People's Socialist Party is the party of all former Bolsheviks in Russia that supported Bukharin. When the Bolsheviks split, Bukharin and his supporters founded their own party under the banner of the NSP. The party supports peaceful progression towards a socialist government with a unique socialist economic plan, the NEP. The NEP describes a system entailing a coexistence of markets, private property, and a planned economy.§!"

SOV_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Partiya Sotsialistov-revolyutsionerov                      §gThe Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries has been the dominant party in Russia for the last 20 years. The party has existed in a coalition with the Kadets under the leadership of President Kerensky, but almost none of the SR's reforms were made. Victor Chernov, leader of the SRs, believes that agrarian socialism is the best path to appease various socialist groups in Russia, but it is unlikely that he can revamp the economic system without the help of other parties.§!"
SOV_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Partiya Narodnoy Svobody (Konstitutsionno-demokraticheskaya Partiya)       §gThe Party of People's Freedom or Constitutional Democrats is the main liberal party in Russia. Its leader, Pavel Milyukov, has been the prime-minister of Russia for 15 years. Under his guidance, a wide range of market liberal reforms were made. Now the party seeks to find balance between socialist and conservative demands and secure Russia as a bastion of democracy.§!"
SOV_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Vserossiyskiy Natsionalniy Soyuz                 §gThe All-Russian National Union is the main conservative party in Russia, uniting different nobles, landlords, and constitutional monarchists. Originally, the party was created in 1908 and unified many conservative parties, organizations, and factions in Russia. After the Civil War, the party was restored in 1922 in opposition to the republican form of government. The VNS and its leader Vasily Shulgin seek to restore constitutional monarchy in Russia, cancel federalization, and support Russians as the main nationality in the country.§!"
SOV_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Evraziyskaya Partiya                                      §gThe Eurasianist Party unites all Eurasianists in Russia and many supporters of a firmer hand in politics. The movement of Eurasianists appeared in the 1920s, created by Prince Nikolay Trubetzkoy, a linguist and historian, who believed that the basis of Russian statehood is as the successor of Mongol despotic monarchy. Eurasianists endorse etatism and Orthodox Christianity.§!"
SOV_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Rossiyskiy Obshchevoinskiy Soyuz                        §gThe Russian All-Military Union is an organization created by Russian General Lavr Kornilov. It seek to unite all White Army generals that were opposed to Bolsheviks during the civil war. The ROVS believes that socialism is a curse, and that Russia should be led by a strong ruler, willing to unite and stabilize the fractured country by any means necessary.§!"
SOV_national_populist_party_long:0 "Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii               §gThe People's Republican Party of Russia is a right-wing party created by a former SR member and terrorist, Boris Savinkov. The NRPR follows a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced Savinkov over the years, all of which merge into a system of totalitarian dictatorial rule, agrarian Socialist-Revolutionary policy, Orthodox Christianity, and a concept of palingenetic rebirth. In the wake of the 1932 economic collapse, the party became popular among many military officers, industrialists, and peasants alike. Savinkov desires to make Russia mainly a peasant republic with an advisory parliament and legalized terror against nonconformity.§!"

Led by Shlyapnikov and Kollontai, the once 'Worker's Opposition' in the NSP party was strictly against control of the Trade Union by the party and the state - a way, supported by Bukharin. The ideological position of the Trade Unionists is very close to the Left SR one, however their main bet is placed on the worker's class.§!"




### Focuses ###
Russia_Socialist:0 "Russian Focus Tree"

SOV_Proletarian_Humanism:0 "Proletarian Humanism"
SOV_Proletarian_Humanism_desc:0 "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision of Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role at the Congress. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict:0 "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc:0 "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation:0 "Voluntary Collectivisation"
SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc:0 "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivisation, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation:0 "Cautious Industrialisation"
SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The super industrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing many issues in its path."

SOV_Control_The_Unions:0 "Control the Unions"
SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc:0 "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation:0 "Fight Bureaucratisation"
SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc:0 "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant struggle, something Lenin already well understood. We will have to continue Comrade Lenin’s fight against the bureaucracy, before it can take hold like a tick and drain our state’s lifeblood of liberty and equality; something we must avoid at all costs. We will also have to train a new class of truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the scores of reactionary swine that still infest our administration."

SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard:0 "Revolutionary Vanguard"
SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc:0 "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, Radek is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and a series of five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards true communism."

SOV_Mass_Collectivisation:0 "Dekulakization"
SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc:0 "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar, and the capitalist. But now there is another enemy in the village - the Kulak, a capitalist farmer, who seeks only profit margin. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of dekulakization of our agricultural industry. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour:0 "Militarisation of Labour"
SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc:0 "Man, at its basis, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion to establish a society based around the interests of the labouring majority. Labour armies will be established, mobilising the proletariat to work under military supervision. We must also fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."

SOV_Proletarian_Revolution:0 "Proletarian Revolution"
SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."

SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan:0 "First Five-Year Plan"
SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The taxation of the peasantry, and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants, will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created. This is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation. The mainstay of these plans shall be the 5-Year Plans: set economic plans with goals to reach within the allotted time to keep our industrialization efforts on track and at rapid pace."

SOV_Industrial_Democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
SOV_Industrial_Democracy_desc:0 "Syndicalist vision for union control over the economy has succeeded in winning over a majority of delegates and chairmen in our soviets."

SOV_Break_The_Smychka:0 "Break The Smychka"
SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc:0 "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

SOV_Create_the_VSR:0 "Create the VSR"
SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc:0 "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

SOV_Separation_Of_Powers:0 "Separation of Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc:0 "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."

SOV_Rebuild_the_Country:0 "Rebuild the Country"
SOV_Rebuild_the_Country_desc:0 "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory. The process of rebuilding the country will be a long and difficult one, and one that we must focus all our efforts towards."

SOV_Help_The_People:0 "Help the People"
SOV_Help_The_People_desc:0 "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the Civil War, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."

SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy:0 "Rebuild the Bureaucracy"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."

SOV_Allow_Small_Traders:0 "Allow Small Traders"
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc:0 "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan:0 "The GOELRO Plan"
SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc:0 "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.' To fulfil this plan we have entrusted a 'State Commission for Electrification of Russia' to electrify the entire nation."

SOV_Form_Gosplan:0 "Form Gosplan"
SOV_Form_Gosplan_desc:0 "In order to complete our lofty economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. This Gosudarstvennyy Planovyy Komitet, or Gosplan, shall serve as the main economic planning office in our nation, precisely dictating how our economy shall operate. Employing some of the brightest minds in Russia, the Gosplan will greatly enhance our new planned economy."

SOV_Mechanisation:0 "Mechanisation"
SOV_Mechanisation_desc:0 "The industrial revolution brought with it many great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."

SOV_Khozraschyot:0 "Khozraschyot"
SOV_Khozraschyot_desc:0 "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

SOV_Promote_Industrialisation:0 "Promote Industrialisation"
SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc:0 "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."

SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits:0 "Force Open the Straits"
SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits_desc:0 "We're no strangers to conflict with the Ottomans. In the past however, monarchs fought against each other for the sake of pride and prizes. Now it is the people that will fight against the monarchs for the sake of worker liberation."

SOV_Into_The_Caucasus:0 "Into the Caucasus"
SOV_Into_The_Caucasus_desc:0 "Lost after the Weltkrieg, the Don-Kuban Union is a reactionary state run by Cossack warlords. Beyond their tyranny lies counter-revolutionaries and religious fundamentalists right at the edge of the theocratic Islamic Empire in the south. As long as they remain at large, these states pose an active threat to our revolution."

SOV_Secure_Central_Asia:0 "Secure Central Asia"
SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc:0 "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring Russian leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

SOV_The_Final_Battle:0 "The Final Battle"
SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc:0 "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

SOV_Enemy_In_The_East:0 "Enemy in the East"
SOV_Enemy_In_The_East_desc:0 "The Empire of Japan holds a large portion of Asia's workers hostage under its despotic military rule. These workers and peasants of Asia yearn to be freed from Japan and her band of warlords and only Russian might is capable of achieving this!"

SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias:0 "Mobilise Urban Militias"
SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc:0 "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birth land. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."

SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units:0 "Krasnaya Gvardiya Units"
SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units_desc:0 "Many members of the Bolshevik Party are still in hiding. We must mobilise and organise these people into military formations, as we need every soldier we can at this point if we want to survive the incoming onslaught."

SOV_Rally_The_Defectors:0 "Rally the Defectors"
SOV_Rally_The_Defectors_desc:0 "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."

SOV_The_War_Effort:0 "The War Effort"
SOV_The_War_Effort_desc:0 "We will need to organise the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "

SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army:0 "Rebuild the Red Army"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army will have to be rebuilt, if we want to win this revolution. A centralised army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, and it will be a capable one the second time around too. Even so, we must be aware of the failures and mistakes of its first incarnation."

SOV_Centralised_Command:0 "Centralised Command"
SOV_Centralised_Command_desc:0 "A centralised command is necessary in military combat - any other alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs. Thus, we will aim to create a cohesive military chain of command, to allow for a more effective fighting force."

SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka:0 "Reinstate the Cheka"
SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka_desc:0 "The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission carried out its duties with diligence. Now that socialist rule has been established, however, we face the threat of subversion from counter-revolutionaries from across the world. In order to fend off the threats both from within and from abroad we must expand the institution and modernise its methods."

SOV_War_Communism:0 "War Communism"
SOV_War_Communism_desc:0 "We must take multiple measures to win this war and to spread the revolution to Russia, however unpopular and brutal many of these may prove to be. They are necessary to win the war and improve the life of the general population in the long-term."

SOV_The_Second_Red_Army:0 "The Second Red Army"
SOV_The_Second_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army must be rebuilt, as it was a great display of proletarian power, even if it was defeated at the end. However, the solution is to rebuild the Red Army and learn from its failure, not to reject the Red Army and the principles it was founded on."

SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production:0 "Reorganise Armament Production"
SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production_desc:0 "The current state of armament production is a disaster. We must reorganise the armament production and end the chaos in the production chain. Only if we do this we can guarantee that every soldier will have a gun to fight the forces of reaction."

SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps:0 "The People's Logistics Corps"
SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps_desc:0 "We must properly organise our logistics. In order to do this, we will create the 'People's Logistic Corps,' which will be in charge of the supply chains, hopefully improving the current state of our logistics - in many areas, a total disaster."

SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions:0 "Dedicated Artillery Battalions"
SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions_desc:0 "We will create independent artillery battalions, which will serve to support our troops and break the enemy lines with waves of artillery shells, preventing them from launching any effective counter-attacks."

SOV_Local_Workshops:0 "Local Workshops"

russoc.50.t:0 "'Troika'"
russoc.50.d:0 "As soon as the Soviet’s power was restored in the majority of Russian lands, Georgy Zhukov, along with Mikhail Tukhachevskiy and Mikhail Frunze, have formed a 'Troika' or Triumvirate - a special political body, consisting of the three of them as the top of the Soviet hierarchy. Frunze became the chairman of the interior, Tukhachevsky the military minister, and Zhukov the head of government.\nThe Troika, however, is very unstable, with each of the generals wanting to call the shots. The youngest of all is Zhukov who, having been the leader of the revolutionaries, is the most likely to come out victorious in the power struggle. On the other hand are the professional revolutionaries and military leaders, Tukhachevskiy and Frunze, who can easily seize the initiative from Zhukov given their large support bases and prestige. All of them know that they will never negotiate, so the main struggle has broken out over their influence in the Military Forces, as a military-backed coup d'etat seems to be the only way for any of these titans of the Russian left to become leader of the Soviets and solely rise to power."
russoc.50.a:0 "So the power struggle begins..."

russoc.51.t:0 "Tremendous Victory at a Local Rally!"
russoc.51.d:0 "Our supporters recently held a great rally that ended in thunderous applause from the gathered crowds; a truly tremendous victory for our cause. It seems that there are more and more supporters of our faction within the supreme Soviet body. We inch closer to seizing control of the Troika with every win!"
russoc.51.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"

russoc.52.t:0 "Successful Rally for our Cause!"
russoc.52.d:0 "Our supporters recently organized a rally in support of our cause, to mild success. We managed to attract more people to support our faction, but the turnout could have been better. This will definitely help us when the time to finally seize power comes, but more effort will be needed next time to increase our next rally’s effectiveness."
russoc.52.a:0 "Good, but not great. We must try harder to achieve our final victory.!"

russoc.53.t:0 "Catastrophic Rally!"
russoc.53.d:0 "To disastrous results, our loyal supporters organized a rally recently. Our rally was not only a great disappointment for our supporters, but also caused a large hit to our support base’s confidence in our struggle to control the Troika. Some of them will perhaps even turn to the other factions instead of ours."
russoc.53.a:0 "Pathetic and disgraceful! We will never seize power with results like this."

russoc.54.t:0 "Speaking with Zinoviev"
russoc.54.d:0 "Grigory Zinoviev is definitely an ambitious and power-hungry man; one who desires to reach the top of the Soviet hierarchy at all costs - moreover, he craves it both here and now. He is a man of no compromises, pursuing power and glory to a bitter-ender and well past his station, or at least nearly everyone in our government seems to think so. That is, everyone except Georgy Zhukov. \nIt is Zhukov alone who is ready to sacrifice his potential chair as Soviet Head of Government, willing to give it to Zinoviev in order to secure his bid to rule the Troika. \nMikhail Tukhachevsky is more provident and subtle, however. He knows that Zinoviev lusts for power far too much to risk allowing the radical to blow his chance at rule. Tukhachevsky will likely try to offer Zinoviev a chair in return for Bolsheviks' support, but that is likely as far as the Red Napoleon will be willing to go.\nOf the members of the Troika, the only one with a stable, long-lasting, and confident relationship with the RKP is, of course, Mikhail Frunze. He and Zinoviev go way back as fellow Bolsheviks, so it is also very likely that the RKP will be swung in favour of Frunze."
russoc.54.a:0 "Zhukov moves to make Zinoviev head of government, active immediately."
russoc.54.b:0 "Tuckachevsky promises Zinoviev a chair."
russoc.54.c:0 "Cast Zinoviev's mind back to his heroics in the Civil War, drifting him back to Frunze."

russoc.55.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Zhukov"
russoc.55.d:0 "Zinoviev has unexpectedly chosen to cooperate with Zhukov and support his cause. The KNOF-RKP coalition is now in control of the government with Zinoviev as its head."
russoc.55.a:0 "We couldn’t have expected this."

russoc.56.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Tukhachevsky"
russoc.56.d:0 "Tukhachevsky was right when he thought that Zinoviev's desire to become a chairman would be enough to lure his lust for power. With Zinoviev successfully courted, the FKIR-RKP coalition will control the government as soon as Tukhachevsky is in power."

russoc.57.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Frunze"
russoc.57.d:0 "There is nothing remarkable in the fact that Zinoviev has chosen to support his old friend and comrade from their shared Bolshevist past. The SPARR-RKP coalition will control the government as soon as Frunze is in power."

russoc.58.t:0 "Speak to Voroshilov."
russoc.58.d:0 "A prominent Bolshevik and general, Kliment Voroshilov, brave veteran of the Civil War, is one of the most popular military leaders in our country and with his popularity and fame has amassed great influence over our armed forces. His support of our cause is especially important in case of military takeover from one of our fellow Troika members, as all three chairmen of the Troika know that only through a coup can they ever have a hope to seize total control over the Supreme Soviet.\nVoroshilov is likely to support Zhukov, the young and promising general, who also happens to be the leader of the third Russian revolution.\nOn the other hand, Voroshilov is known for his loyalty to the Bolshevist cause. Despite the fact that Frunze is no longer a member of the RKP and has since founded a more conservative, or rightist, socialist party, Voroshilov can easily be reminded of his past glories shared with Frunze during the Russian Civil War.\nFinally, the venerated Tukhachevsky and Voroshilov have shared very embittered relations for years. In fact, Voroshilov will attempt almost anything to prevent Tukhachevsky from rising to power. Perhaps, we act on this chance to eliminate his threat from the Red Napoleon..."

russoc.60.t:0 "Voroshilov Supports Frunze"
russoc.60.d:0 "Nothing is more important in this world than loyalty, and Voroshilov knows this best. Forced to reminisce on the 'good ol’ days' during the chaos of Russian Civil War made Voroshilov drift back to and support Frunze."
russoc.60.a:0 "How expected of him."

russoc.61.t:0 "Plotting Against Voroshilov."
russoc.61.d:0 "Tukhachevsky knows what he must do in order to fully secure his path to power. Voroshilov must disappear as soon as possible. He has already supported one of the Troika members openly in public dialogues, and it is likely that he may try something to jeopardize Tukhachevsky’s shot at supreme power, so we should act quickly. However, we should never forget that this operation is extremely risky. If we fail, the plot could be exposed. If that were too occur, nothing good would be guaranteed to Tukhachevsky in this case as the rest of the Troika would likely seek retribution."
russoc.61.a:0 "Make it look like an accident to avert suspicion."
russoc.61.b:0 "Blatant assassination is a cheaper, quicker, and more reliable way."

russoc.71.t:0 "The PLSR Supports Frunze"
russoc.71.d:0 "Against all odds and expectations, the PLSR will now be supporting their former enemy, the Bolshevik Mikhail Frunze. This unlikely and unstable alliance will likely catapult Frunze to the forefront of the race to take lead of the Troika."

With all the differences between the three titans that made up the council proving impossible to settle, a move has been made. With unconfirmed reports coming in from all across Moscow and the nation at large, all that can be determined is that one of the factions of the Troika has made its move and tried to topple the government in an attempt to seize the reigns of power in the Soviet Union.

They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus want to break-up the smychka strongly, supporting the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction lead by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation, that is to extract the peasant surplus value and to use this to develop the productive forces to transition to make Russia ready for socialism, which is best developed in their mind through five-year plan."

russoc.105.d:0 "For years, the course of events during the October Revolution have been a mystery to the world and the general population. The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."

russoc.106.d:0 "The government's program of mass collectivization, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialize in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the program of collectivization to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozes) do not even pay their farmers a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destabilized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."

russoc.110.d:0 "As socialism seeks to unite humanity and wither away states in the future, many in the government have proposed that the [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government should begin Latinising the languages in its nations, as the Cyrillic alphabet would impend communication between Western Europe and Russia and the people compromising it, among others. However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the amount of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the land compromising this nations. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoliy Lunacharskiy, who is known for his more unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious groups."

While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organization, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the young pioneers. \n\nThe routine of the young pioneers consist of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs; which has given the young pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as it gives many in the youth, who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."

russoc.212.d:0 "Tukhachevsky has established a dictatorship of Totalist Internationalism and promises that a new age is dawning in Russia, promising Russia’s return as a dominant military force while also transforming it into an industrial powerhouse. With Russia now standing as the dominant force of socialism in the East, it is natural that it should spread its enlightened ideology to the rest of East and to the wider world at large.

According to the plan, all the future Soviet Republics, that are currently under German Yoke, should become Autonomous republics under the control of the central apparatus in [ROOT.GetCapital]. Their autonomy will be greatly limited though, with no right to secede from the Union. Therefore, the future Union will be unitary and centralised.

russoc.13.d:0 "During the preliminary debate about the fate of the trade unions, a dispute arose between Shlyapnikov and Bukharin. Since Bukharin is a consistent supporter of control over trade unions and refuses to recognize them as independent unions of workers, another prominent figure of the party, Shlyapnikov, announced the creation of a group of 'Workers' Opposition'. Shlyapnikov's position was even more to the left than that of the Left SRS. Shlyapnikov criticized the NEP and called on the delegates to pay attention to the success of the syndicalists in France and England. Supported by other delegates, including Kollontai, Shlyapnikov presented a program of 'Trade Unionists', which impressed the delegates with its outspoken syndicalist approach. In any case, the Trade Unionists are now a separate faction participating in the Congress. If their ideas are recognized by the delegates, they can take a leading role in the government."

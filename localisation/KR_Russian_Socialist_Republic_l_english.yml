### Focuses ###
Russia_Socialist:0 "Russian Focus Tree"

SOV_Proletarian_Humanism:0 "Proletarian Humanism"
SOV_Proletarian_Humanism_desc:0 "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role in the All-Union Communist Party. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict:0 "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc:0 "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation:0 "Voluntary Collectivisation"
SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc:0 "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivisation, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation:0 "Cautious Industrialisation"
SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The superindustrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing much issues in its path."

SOV_Control_The_Unions:0 "Control the Unions"
SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc:0 "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation:0 "Fight Bureaucratisation"
SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc:0 "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant fight, something Lenin already understood. We will have to fight the bureaucracy, before it can establish itself already, something we have to avoid at all costs. We will also have to train truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the reactionary bureaucrats we still have plenty of."

SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard:0 "Revolutionary Vanguard"
SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc:0 "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, he is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards socialism."

SOV_Mass_Collectivisation:0 "Mass Collectivisation"
SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc:0 "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar and the capitalist. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of rapid collectivisation of our farms. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour:0 "Militarisation of Labour"
SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc:0 "Man, at its basis, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion ato establish a society based around the interests of the labouring majority. Labour armies will be established, mobilising the proletariat to work under military supervision. We must also fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."

SOV_Proletarian_Revolution:0 "Proletarian Revolution"
SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."

SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan:0 "First Five-Year Plan"
SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The taxation of the peasantry and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created, which is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation."

SOV_Industrial_Democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
SOV_Industrial_Democracy_desc:0 "Kollontay's vision for union control over the economy has succeeded in winning over a majority of comrades. Despite her noble ancestry, she has always been a fighter for more control of unions and thus workers over the economy, as unions are the best representation of the will of the proletariat."

SOV_Break_The_Smychka:0 "Break The Smychka"
SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc:0 "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

SOV_Create_the_VSR:0 "Create the VSR"
SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc:0 "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

SOV_Separation_Of_Powers:0 "Separation of Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc:0 "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."

SOV_Rebuild_the_Country:0 "Rebuild the Country"
SOV_Rebuild_the_Country_desc:0 "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory. The process of rebuilding the country will be a long and difficult one, and one that we must focus all our efforts towards."

SOV_Help_The_People:0 "Help the People"
SOV_Help_The_People_desc:0 "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the Civil War, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."

SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy:0 "Rebuild the Bureaucracy"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."

SOV_Allow_Small_Traders:0 "Allow Small Traders"
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc:0 "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan:0 "The GOELRO Plan"
SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc:0 "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.' To fulfil this plan we have entrusted a 'State Commission for Electrification of Russia' to electrify the entire nation."

SOV_Form_Gosplan:0 "Form Gosplan"
SOV_Form_Gosplan_desc:0 "In order to complete our economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. Employing the some of the brightest minds in Russia, Gosplan will greatly enhance our economy."

SOV_Mechanisation:0 "Mechanisation"
SOV_Mechanisation_desc:0 "The industrial revolution brought with it great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."

SOV_Khozraschyot:0 "Khozraschyot"
SOV_Khozraschyot_desc:0 "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

SOV_Promote_Industrialisation:0 "Promote Industrialisation"
SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc:0 "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."

SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits:0 "Force Open the Straits"
SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits_desc:0 "We're no strangers to conflict with the Ottomans. In the past however, monarchs fought against each other for the sake of pride and prizes. Now it is the people that will fight against the monarchs for the sake of worker liberation."

SOV_Into_The_Caucasus:0 "Into the Caucasus"
SOV_Into_The_Caucasus_desc:0 "Lost after the Weltkrieg, the Don-Kuban Union is a reactionary state run by Cossack warlords. Beyond their tyranny lies counter-revolutionaries and religious fundamentalists right at the edge of the theocratic Islamic Empire in the south. As long as they remain at large, these states pose an active threat to our revolution."

SOV_Secure_Central_Asia:0 "Secure Central Asia"
SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc:0 "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring Russian leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

SOV_The_Final_Battle:0 "The Final Battle"
SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc:0 "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

SOV_Enemy_In_The_East:0 "Enemy in the East"
SOV_Enemy_In_The_East_desc:0 "The Empire of Japan holds a large portion Asia's workers hostage under its despotic military rule. These workers and peasants of Asia yearn to be freed from Japan and her band of warlords and only Russian might is capable of achieving this!"

SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias:0 "Mobilise Urban Militias"
SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc:0 "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birthland. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."

SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units:0 "Krasnaya Gvardiya Units"
SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units_desc:0 "Many members of the Bolshevik Party are still in hiding. We must mobilise and organise these people into military formations, as we need every soldier we can at this point if we want to survive the incoming onslaught."

SOV_Rally_The_Defectors:0 "Rally the Defectors"
SOV_Rally_The_Defectors_desc:0 "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."

SOV_The_War_Effort:0 "The War Effort"
SOV_The_War_Effort_desc:0 "We will need to organise the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "

SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army:0 "Rebuild the Red Army"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army will have to be rebuilt, if we want to win this revolution. A centralised army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, and it will be a capable one the second time around too. Even so, we must be aware of the failures and mistakes of its first incarnation."

SOV_Centralised_Command:0 "Centralised Command"
SOV_Centralised_Command_desc:0 "A centralised command is necessary in military combat - any other alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs. Thus, we will aim to create a cohesive military chain of command, to allow for a more effective fighting force."

SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka:0 "Reinstate the Cheka"
SOV_Reinstate_The_Cheka_desc:0 "The All-Russian Extraordinary Commission carried out its duties with diligence. Now that socialist rule has been established, however, we face the threat of subversion from counter-revolutionaries from across the world. In order to fend off the threats both from within and from abroad we must expand the institution and modernise its methods."

SOV_War_Communism:0 "War Communism"
SOV_War_Communism_desc:0 "We must take multiple measures to win this war and to spread the revolution to Russia, however unpopular and brutal many of these may prove to be. They are necessary to win the war and improve the life of the general population in the long-term."

SOV_The_Second_Red_Army:0 "The Second Red Army"
SOV_The_Second_Red_Army_desc:0 "The Red Army must be rebuilt, as it was a great display of proletarian power, even if it was defeated at the end. However, the solution is to rebuild the Red Army and learn from its failure, not to reject the Red Army and the principles it was founded on."

SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production:0 "Reorganise Armament Production"
SOV_Reorganise_Armament_Production_desc:0 "The current state of armament production is a disaster. We must reorganise the armament production and end the chaos in the production chain. Only if we do this we can guarantee that every soldier will have a gun to fight the forces of reaction."

SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps:0 "The People's Logistics Corps"
SOV_The_Peoples_Logistics_Corps_desc:0 "We must properly organise our logistics. In order to do this, we will create the 'People's Logistic Corps,' which will be in charge of the supply chains, hopefully improving the current state of our logistics - in many areas, a total disaster."

SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions:0 "Dedicated Artillery Battalions"
SOV_Dedicated_Artillery_Battalions_desc:0 "We will create independent artillery battalions, which will serve to support our troops and break the enemy lines with waves of artillery shells, preventing them from launching any effective counter-attacks."

SOV_Local_Workshops:0 "Local Workshops"
SOV_Local_Workshops_desc:0 "We will create local workshops all throughout the nation, to allow for local arms production, which is better suited to serve the local situation and needs than a centralised way of organising the production."

SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya:0 "Empower the Krasnaya Gvardiya"
SOV_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_desc:0 "We must create a bottom-up army structure - an army which is truly representative of the revolutionary spirit. We will support the democratic election of commanders, even if it may cause some issues at times - the soldiers in the field probably know better who should command them than our leaders, far away from the situation."

SOV_Decentralised_Structure:0 "Decentralised Structure"
SOV_Decentralised_Structure_desc:0 "We must further decentralise the revolutionary army of ours, giving every part of the chain considerable autonomy and preventing the higher-ups from being able to dictate to the rest of the chain what they should do and how."

SOV_Reconnaissance_Units:0 "Reconnaissance Units"
SOV_Reconnaissance_Units_desc:0 "By creating units dedicated to reconnaissance we will always be one step ahead of the enemy. We will know what their next plan is and what we need to do to counter-act it."

SOV_Officer_Initiative:0 "Officer Initiative"
SOV_Officer_Initiative_desc:0 "Encouraging officers to make their own decisions autonomously will allow for better responses to sudden changes, as they are more knowledgeable about the situation on the ground than some far away higher-ups, who never visited the area properly."

SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics:0 "Small Unit Tactics"
SOV_Small_Unit_Tactics_desc:0 "Instead of using masses of troops, using small units allows for us to be far quicker in our attacks and surprise than if we use large waves of soldiers. This will also give us more easily the element of surprise."

SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan:0 "Frunze's Reform Plan"
SOV_Frunzes_Reform_Plan_desc:0 "With the revolution secured, for now, we can focus on other matters. Frunze has proposed that we should focus on improving the high command and officer training and generally improve the defence of the army against a possible invasion, a real threat, as the forces of reaction will probably try to end the revolution in the future."

SOV_Expand_The_High_Command:0 "Expand the High Command"
SOV_Expand_The_High_Command_desc:0 "The high command will need to be expanded to include many of the best generals we have, who were all able to show their skill in the Second Russian Revolution. Only a high command truly including the best of the best will be able to do intelligent decisions."

SOV_Officer_Training_Academies:0 "Officer Training Academies"
SOV_Officer_Training_Academies_desc:0 "Our military academies are in many ways still a relic of the past, with most being from the time of the Tsar. We will create a series of new military academies, following the best doctrine, not the most traditional doctrine. Only this way we will create an officer corps, which is truly superior to the ones of the capitalists."

SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps:0 "Professional Engineer Corps"
SOV_Professional_Engineer_Corps_desc:0 "Our army still lacks a proper engineer corps, at least a formalised one. We will change this situation by creating a formal engineer corps, which will be professionally trained in their craft."

SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan:0 "Tukhachevskiy's Reform Plan"
SOV_Tukhachevskiys_Reform_Plan_desc:0 "Tukhachevskiy has proposed to use the doctrine of deep battle, which proposes the use of combined arms and overwhelming land-air attacks. Such a doctrine would make the army a true force to be reckoned with on the offensive."

SOV_Mass_Breakthroughs:0 "Mass Breakthroughs"
SOV_Mass_Breakthroughs_desc:0 "Armour is the future, we will need to support the development of new tanks if we want to create a truly modern arm force, which is able to encircle and destroy enemy divisions at record speeds."

SOV_Land_Air_Integration:0 "Land-Air Integration"
SOV_Land_Air_Integration_desc:0 "The integrated use of soldiers and aircraft will allow for the overwhelming of the troops and for our army to crush the enemy completely."

SOV_Establish_The_VVS:0 "Establish the VVS"
SOV_Establish_The_VVS_desc:0 "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."

SOV_Airspace_Defence:0 "Airspace Defence"
SOV_Airspace_Defence_desc:0 "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our airspace and terrorise the land troops, something we will have to avoid at all costs if we want to be victorious in future encounters."

SOV_The_ORT_System:0 "The ORT System"
SOV_The_ORT_System_desc:0 "Modern wars are only partially won on the battlefield. Equally important are the men and women behind desks and radios, dealing with intelligence and transmissions. We need to make their work easier."

SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry:0 "Nationalise the Aircraft Industry"
SOV_Nationalise_The_Aircraft_Industry_desc:0 "We have a highly modern aircraft industry, however often it is still private. We will have to nationalise this aircraft industry and integrate it into the state apparatus if we want to create a modern and strong air force."

SOV_Aviation_Bureaus:0 "Aviation Bureaus"
SOV_Aviation_Bureaus_desc:0 "Opening aviation bureaus throughout the nation will allow us to improve our pilots, something which is always an important duty of the nation, if we want to create a capable air force."

SOV_New_Fighters:0 "New Fighters"
SOV_New_Fighters_desc:0 "While bombers may damage our opposition, not a single one of them will reach their targets without sufficient protection from our fighters. These fighters can also provide cover for our own troops and industry."

SOV_Take_To_The_Seas:0 "Take to the Seas"
SOV_Take_To_The_Seas_desc:0 "If we are to stand proud among the great nations of Europe again, we must build a new, modern navy that can challenge the great powers of Europe and the world."

### Events ###
russoc.100.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Wants to Join the Internationale"
russoc.100.d:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap], having recently become enlightened to the benefits of socialist government, has approached us with a request. They wish to formally join the Internationale. Would such a distant ally be worthwhile?"
russoc.100.a:0 "Of course! We welcome them."
russoc.100.b:0 "We have no need of them."

russoc.101.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
russoc.101.d:0 "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance. Perhaps we are not syndicalist enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
russoc.101.a:0 "A poor decision on their part."

russoc.102.t:0 "Conflict in the Party"
russoc.102.d:0 "The party has come to be divided between three factions, one lead by Bukharin, one by Kollontay and one by Radek. The one by Bukharin champions a path of socialism at a snail's pace, where cautious industrialisation prevents the creation of a massive state bureaucracy as well as wanting to preserve the smychka at all costs and wanting to bridge the general urban-rural divide in the country.\n\nThe faction lead by Kollontay promotes the unions managing the economy, seeing them as the best way to give workers a voice in the economy and the nation. They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus want to break-up the smychka strongly, supporting the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction lead by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation, that is to extract the peasant surplus value and to use this to develop the productive forces to transition to make Russia ready for socialism, which is best developed in their mind through five-year plan."
russoc.102.a:0 "Bukharin's faction wins the day."
russoc.102.b:0 "Kollontay's faction establishes itself as the winner."
russoc.102.c:0 "Radek wins a surprise victory."

russoc.103.t:0 "The Eastern Threat"

This is nothing less than an utter catastrophe - the newly-empowered Russian socialists are all but certain to align with [FRA.GetNameDef] and the Third Internationale, reviving the dreaded spectre of another two-front war. However, [SOV.GetNameDef] will need time to recover from the devastation of the civil war, a time we must use to extend our protection to any countries endangered by the new regime.\n\nPoland, Finland and the Caucasus all stand unprotected - we must do whatever we can to protect them, lest they fall to the incoming Russians."

russoc.105.d:0 "story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is alive, however - he fled in a cruiser to whereabouts unknown in the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."

russoc.106.d:0 "The government's program of mass collectivization, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialize in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the program of collectivization to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destablized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."

In this game, there are two teams: kulaks hiding grain and requisitioning brigades intending to requisition the grain. The [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has encouraged this, seeing it as a possibility to increase the influence of Socialists among the children."

The game has become so popular in fact that companies have begun to sell air-guns explicitly for Reds and Whites, with those guns being very popular among children too. The government has strongly supported this, seeing it as a way to mould the youth to be more open to Socialism even in the future."

russoc.109.d:0 "While many revolutionaries had a religious background or learned at religious schools, they do not have a good opinion on the Church in general, seeking to break the Orthodox Church and its influence on the Russian society both legally and through their public influence. However, while curbing their cultural influence will take out longer, the government has begun eroding the influence of the Orthodox Church legally.\n\nThe [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has begun measures to take away the control and forming of marriages away from the Church and making it a civil affair of the government, they also greatly simplified divorce, where it is now a simple matter of registration, instead of the former hard process in Tsarist and Republican Russia.\n\nHowever, while this has greatly improved the mobility of women to leave abusive families, it also resulted in a massive spike of divorce rates on a level never seen before, with the divorce rate being the highest in the world now, thanks to divorce being this easy now."

However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the amount of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the land compromising this nations. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoliy Lunacharskiy, who is known for his more unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious groups."

russoc.111.d:0 "The Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization has recently been founded, after a long conflict between the Komsomol and the scout movement was decided in the favour of the scout movement, who wanted an independent organization, while Konsomol wanted to keep them integrated into the organization, being helped by the widow of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya, who supported the cause of the scout movement against Komsomol.\n\nThe intent of the young pioneers is to further integrate the youth into the state machinery, swearing an oath to 'to stand firmly for the cause of our Communist Party.' While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organization, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the young pioneers.\n\nThe routine of the young pioneers consist out of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs; which has given the young pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as it gives many in the youth, who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."

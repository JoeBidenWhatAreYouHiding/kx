SOV_totalist_party_long:0 "Rossiyskaya Kommunisticheskaya Partiya               §gThe Russian Communist Party emerged from a left-wing group of Bolsheviks, that were against Bukharin. The RKP, led by Zinoviev, supports orthodox Marxism-Leninism, collectivisation, rapid industrialisation and is strongly opposed to Bukharin's market socialism. The RKP is banned in Russia, but they still retain a solid following. They may see an opportunity to take power if the situation in the country radically changes.§!"
SOV_syndicalist_party_long:0 "Partiya Levykh Sotsialistov-revolyutsionerov             §gThe Party of Left Socialists-Revolutionaries is the main syndicalist party in Russia. It split from the PSR in 1917 to support the Bolshevik revolutionaries. However, the Left SRs came to oppose the Bolsheviks and their extremist tendencies. After the defeat of the Reds in the Civil War, the Left SRs consolidated their power as a true syndicalist force, taking inspiration from the successful syndicalist revolution in France. The party promotes revolutionary syndicalism based on voluntary association of autonomous labor collectives and trade union cooperatives.§!"
SOV_radical_socialist_party_long:0 "Narodnaya Sotsialisticheskaya Partiya              §gThe People's Socialist Party is the party of all former Bolsheviks in Russia that supported Bukharin. When the Bolsheviks split, Bukharin and his supporters founded their own party under the banner of the NSP. The party supports peaceful progression towards a socialist government with a unique socialist economic plan, the NEP. The NEP describes a system entailing a coexistence of markets, private property, and a planned economy.§!"

SOV_social_liberal_party_long:0 "Partiya Sotsialistov-revolyutsionerov                      §gThe Party of Socialists-Revolutionaries has been the dominant party in Russia for the last 20 years. The party has existed in a coalition with the Kadets under the leadership of President Kerensky, but almost none of the SR's reforms were made. Victor Chernov, leader of the SRs, believes that agrarian socialism is the best path to appease various socialist groups in Russia, but it is unlikely that he can revamp the economic system without the help of other parties.§!"
SOV_market_liberal_party_long:0 "Partiya Narodnoy Svobody (Konstitutsionno-demokraticheskaya Partiya)       §gThe Party of People's Freedom or Constitutional Democrats is the main liberal party in Russia. Its leader, Pavel Milyukov, has been the prime-minister of Russia for 15 years. Under his guidance, a wide range of market liberal reforms were made. Now the party seeks to find balance between socialist and conservative demands and secure Russia as a bastion of democracy.§!"
SOV_social_conservative_party_long:0 "Vserossiyskiy Natsionalniy Soyuz                 §gThe All-Russian National Union is the main conservative party in Russia, uniting different nobles, landlords, and constitutional monarchists. Originally, the party was created in 1908 and unified many conservative parties, organizations, and factions in Russia. After the Civil War, the party was restored in 1922 in opposition to the republican form of government. The VNS and its leader Vasily Shulgin seek to restore constitutional monarchy in Russia, cancel federalization, and support Russians as the main nationality in the country.§!"
SOV_authoritarian_democrat_party_long:0 "Evraziyskaya Partiya                                      §gThe Eurasianist Party unites all Eurasianists in Russia and many supporters of a firmer hand in politics. The movement of Eurasianists appeared in the 1920s, created by Prince Nikolay Trubetzkoy, a linguist and historian, who believed that the basis of Russian statehood is as the successor of Mongol despotic monarchy. Eurasianists endorse etatism and Orthodox Christianity.§!"
SOV_paternal_autocrat_party_long:0 "Rossiyskiy Obshchevoinskiy Soyuz                        §gThe Russian All-Military Union is an organization created by Russian General Lavr Kornilov. It seek to unite all White Army generals that were opposed to Bolsheviks during the civil war. The ROVS believes that socialism is a curse, and that Russia should be led by a strong ruler, willing to unite and stabilize the fractured country by any means necessary.§!"
SOV_national_populist_party_long:0 "Narodno-Respublikanskaya Partiya Rossii               §gThe People's Republican Party of Russia is a right-wing party created by a former SR member and terrorist, Boris Savinkov. The NRPR follows a syncretic ideology of numerous ideas which have influenced Savinkov over the years, all of which merge into a system of totalitarian dictatorial rule, agrarian Socialist-Revolutionary policy, Orthodox Christianity, and a concept of palingenetic rebirth. In the wake of the 1932 economic collapse, the party became popular among many military officers, industrialists, and peasants alike. Savinkov desires to make Russia mainly a peasant republic with an advisory parliament and legalized terror against nonconformity.§!"

### Focuses ###
Russia_Socialist:0 "Russian Focus Tree"

SOV_Proletarian_Humanism:0 "Proletarian Humanism"
SOV_Proletarian_Humanism_desc:0 "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision of Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role at the Congress. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict:0 "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc:0 "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation:0 "Voluntary Collectivisation"
SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc:0 "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivisation, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation:0 "Cautious Industrialisation"
SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc:0 "The super industrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing many issues in its path."

SOV_Control_The_Unions:0 "Control the Unions"
SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc:0 "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation:0 "Fight Bureaucratisation"
SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc:0 "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant struggle, something Lenin already well understood. We will have to continue Comrade Lenin’s fight against the bureaucracy, before it can take hold like a tick and drain our state’s lifeblood of liberty and equality; something we must avoid at all costs. We will also have to train a new class of truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the scores of reactionary swine that still infest our administration."

SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard:0 "Revolutionary Vanguard"
SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc:0 "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, Radek is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and a series of five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards true communism."

SOV_Mass_Collectivisation:0 "Dekulakization"
SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc:0 "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar, and the capitalist. But now there is another enemy in the village - the Kulak, a capitalist farmer, who seeks only profit margin. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of dekulakization of our agricultural industry. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour:0 "Militarisation of Labour"
SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc:0 "Man, at its basis, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion to establish a society based around the interests of the labouring majority. Labour armies will be established, mobilising the proletariat to work under military supervision. We must also fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."

SOV_Proletarian_Revolution:0 "Proletarian Revolution"
SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."

SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan:0 "First Five-Year Plan"
SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc:0 "The taxation of the peasantry, and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants, will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism to be created. This is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation. The mainstay of these plans shall be the 5-Year Plans: set economic plans with goals to reach within the allotted time to keep our industrialization efforts on track and at rapid pace."


SOV_Break_The_Smychka:0 "Break The Smychka"
SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc:0 "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

SOV_Create_the_VSR:0 "Create the VSR"
SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc:0 "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

SOV_Separation_Of_Powers:0 "Separation of Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc:0 "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."

SOV_Rebuild_the_Country:0 "Rebuild the Country"
SOV_Rebuild_the_Country_desc:0 "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory. The process of rebuilding the country will be a long and difficult one, and one that we must focus all our efforts towards."

SOV_Help_The_People:0 "Help the People"
SOV_Help_The_People_desc:0 "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the Civil War, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."

SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy:0 "Rebuild the Bureaucracy"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc:0 "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."

SOV_Allow_Small_Traders:0 "Allow Small Traders"
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc:0 "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan:0 "Electrify Rural Areas"
SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc:0 "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.' Despite the electifaction, made by Kerensky government, it is still not enough. To fulfil this plan we have entrusted a 'State Commission for Electrification of Russia' to electrify the entire nation."

SOV_Form_Gosplan:0 "Form Gosplan"
SOV_Form_Gosplan_desc:0 "In order to complete our lofty economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. This Gosudarstvennyy Planovyy Komitet, or Gosplan, shall serve as the main economic planning office in our nation, precisely dictating how our economy shall operate. Employing some of the brightest minds in Russia, the Gosplan will greatly enhance our new planned economy."

SOV_Mechanisation:0 "Mechanisation"
SOV_Mechanisation_desc:0 "The industrial revolution brought with it many great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."

SOV_Khozraschyot:0 "Khozraschyot"
SOV_Khozraschyot_desc:0 "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

SOV_Promote_Industrialisation:0 "Promote Industrialisation"
SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc:0 "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution:0 "Spreading the Revolution"
SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc:0 "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."

SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits:0 "Force Open the Straits"
SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits_desc:0 "We're no strangers to conflict with the Ottomans. In the past however, monarchs fought against each other for the sake of pride and prizes. Now it is the people that will fight against the monarchs for the sake of worker liberation."

SOV_Into_The_Caucasus:0 "Into the Caucasus"
SOV_Into_The_Caucasus_desc:0 "Lost after the Weltkrieg, the Don-Kuban Union is a reactionary state run by Cossack warlords. Beyond their tyranny lies counter-revolutionaries and religious fundamentalists right at the edge of the theocratic Islamic Empire in the south. As long as they remain at large, these states pose an active threat to our revolution."

SOV_Secure_Central_Asia:0 "Secure Central Asia"
SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc:0 "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring Russian leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

SOV_The_Final_Battle:0 "The Final Battle"
SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc:0 "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

SOV_Enemy_In_The_East:0 "Enemy in the East"
SOV_Enemy_In_The_East_desc:0 "The Empire of Japan holds a large portion of Asia's workers hostage under its despotic military rule. These workers and peasants of Asia yearn to be freed from Japan and her band of warlords and only Russian might is capable of achieving this!"


### Army Focuses ###

SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias:0 "Mobilise Urban Militias"
SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc:0 "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birth land. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."

SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units:0 "Krasnaya Gvardiya Units"
SOV_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_Units_desc:0 "Many members of the Bolshevik Party are still in hiding. We must mobilise and organise these people into military formations, as we need every soldier we can at this point if we want to survive the incoming onslaught."

SOV_Rally_The_Defectors:0 "Rally the Defectors"

russoc.50.t:0 "'Troika'"
russoc.50.d:0 "As soon as the Soviet’s power was restored in the majority of Russian lands, Georgy Zhukov, along with Mikhail Tukhachevskiy and Mikhail Frunze, have formed a 'Troika' or Triumvirate - a special political body, consisting of the three of them as the top of the Soviet hierarchy. Frunze became the chairman of the interior, Tukhachevsky the military minister, and Zhukov the head of government.\nThe Troika, however, is very unstable, with each of the generals wanting to call the shots. The youngest of all is Zhukov who, having been the leader of the revolutionaries, is the most likely to come out victorious in the power struggle. On the other hand are the professional revolutionaries and military leaders, Tukhachevskiy and Frunze, who can easily seize the initiative from Zhukov given their large support bases and prestige. All of them know that they will never negotiate, so the main struggle has broken out over their influence in the Military Forces, as a military-backed coup d'etat seems to be the only way for any of these titans of the Russian left to become leader of the Soviets and solely rise to power."
russoc.50.a:0 "So the power struggle begins..."

russoc.51.t:0 "Tremendous Victory at a Local Rally!"
russoc.51.d:0 "Our supporters recently held a great rally that ended in thunderous applause from the gathered crowds; a truly tremendous victory for our cause. It seems that there are more and more supporters of our faction within the supreme Soviet body. We inch closer to seizing control of the Troika with every win!"
russoc.51.a:0 "Onwards to victory!"

russoc.52.t:0 "Successful Rally for our Cause!"
russoc.52.d:0 "Our supporters recently organized a rally in support of our cause, to mild success. We managed to attract more people to support our faction, but the turnout could have been better. This will definitely help us when the time to finally seize power comes, but more effort will be needed next time to increase our next rally’s effectiveness."
russoc.52.a:0 "Good, but not great. We must try harder to achieve our final victory.!"

russoc.53.t:0 "Catastrophic Rally!"
russoc.53.d:0 "To disastrous results, our loyal supporters organized a rally recently. Our rally was not only a great disappointment for our supporters, but also caused a large hit to our support base’s confidence in our struggle to control the Troika. Some of them will perhaps even turn to the other factions instead of ours."
russoc.53.a:0 "Pathetic and disgraceful! We will never seize power with results like this."

russoc.54.t:0 "Speaking with Zinoviev"
russoc.54.d:0 "Grigory Zinoviev is definitely an ambitious and power-hungry man; one who desires to reach the top of the Soviet hierarchy at all costs - moreover, he craves it both here and now. He is a man of no compromises, pursuing power and glory to a bitter-ender and well past his station, or at least nearly everyone in our government seems to think so. That is, everyone except Georgy Zhukov. \nIt is Zhukov alone who is ready to sacrifice his potential chair as Soviet Head of Government, willing to give it to Zinoviev in order to secure his bid to rule the Troika. \nMikhail Tukhachevsky is more provident and subtle, however. He knows that Zinoviev lusts for power far too much to risk allowing the radical to blow his chance at rule. Tukhachevsky will likely try to offer Zinoviev a chair in return for Bolsheviks' support, but that is likely as far as the Red Napoleon will be willing to go.\nOf the members of the Troika, the only one with a stable, long-lasting, and confident relationship with the RKP is, of course, Mikhail Frunze. He and Zinoviev go way back as fellow Bolsheviks, so it is also very likely that the RKP will be swung in favour of Frunze."
russoc.54.a:0 "Zhukov moves to make Zinoviev head of government, active immediately."
russoc.54.b:0 "Tuckachevsky promises Zinoviev a chair."
russoc.54.c:0 "Cast Zinoviev's mind back to his heroics in the Civil War, drifting him back to Frunze."

russoc.55.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Zhukov"
russoc.55.d:0 "Zinoviev has unexpectedly chosen to cooperate with Zhukov and support his cause. The KNOF-RKP coalition is now in control of the government with Zinoviev as its head."
russoc.55.a:0 "We couldn’t have expected this."

russoc.56.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Tukhachevsky"
russoc.56.d:0 "Tukhachevsky was right when he thought that Zinoviev's desire to become a chairman would be enough to lure his lust for power. With Zinoviev successfully courted, the FKIR-RKP coalition will control the government as soon as Tukhachevsky is in power."

russoc.57.t:0 "Zinoviev Supports Frunze"
russoc.57.d:0 "There is nothing remarkable in the fact that Zinoviev has chosen to support his old friend and comrade from their shared Bolshevist past. The SPARR-RKP coalition will control the government as soon as Frunze is in power."

russoc.58.t:0 "Speak to Voroshilov."
russoc.58.d:0 "A prominent Bolshevik and general, Kliment Voroshilov, brave veteran of the Civil War, is one of the most popular military leaders in our country and with his popularity and fame has amassed great influence over our armed forces. His support of our cause is especially important in case of military takeover from one of our fellow Troika members, as all three chairmen of the Troika know that only through a coup can they ever have a hope to seize total control over the Supreme Soviet.\nVoroshilov is likely to support Zhukov, the young and promising general, who also happens to be the leader of the third Russian revolution.\nOn the other hand, Voroshilov is known for his loyalty to the Bolshevist cause. Despite the fact that Frunze is no longer a member of the RKP and has since founded a more conservative, or rightist, socialist party, Voroshilov can easily be reminded of his past glories shared with Frunze during the Russian Civil War.\nFinally, the venerated Tukhachevsky and Voroshilov have shared very embittered relations for years. In fact, Voroshilov will attempt almost anything to prevent Tukhachevsky from rising to power. Perhaps, we act on this chance to eliminate his threat from the Red Napoleon..."
russoc.58.a:0 "Zhukov promotes Voroshilov to win his loyalty."
russoc.58.b:0 "Frunze reminds Voroshilov of the ‘good ol’ days’."
russoc.58.c:0 "Voroshilov should disappear to ensure Tukhachevsky’s safety."

russoc.59.t:0 "Voroshilov Supports Zhukov"
russoc.59.d:0 "It appears that a well-earned promotion was more important to Voroshilov than 'the good ol’ days' during the chaos of the Russian Civil War. Voroshilov has sided with Zhukov!"
russoc.59.a:0 "What an unexpected surprise."

russoc.60.t:0 "Voroshilov Supports Frunze"
russoc.60.d:0 "Nothing is more important in this world than loyalty, and Voroshilov knows this best. Forced to reminisce on the 'good ol’ days' during the chaos of Russian Civil War made Voroshilov drift back to and support Frunze."
russoc.60.a:0 "How expected of him."

russoc.61.t:0 "Plotting Against Voroshilov."
russoc.61.d:0 "Tukhachevsky knows what he must do in order to fully secure his path to power. Voroshilov must disappear as soon as possible. He has already supported one of the Troika members openly in public dialogues, and it is likely that he may try something to jeopardize Tukhachevsky’s shot at supreme power, so we should act quickly. However, we should never forget that this operation is extremely risky. If we fail, the plot could be exposed. If that were too occur, nothing good would be guaranteed to Tukhachevsky in this case as the rest of the Troika would likely seek retribution."
russoc.61.a:0 "Make it look like an accident to avert suspicion."
russoc.61.b:0 "Blatant assassination is a cheaper, quicker, and more reliable way."
russoc.61.c:0 "It's too risky. Back down from this idea at once and destroy all evidence of our discussions."

russoc.62.t:0 "Plot Against Voroshilov Discovered!"
russoc.62.d:0 "Our secret services have reported on overhearing whispers from both conspiracy nuts and certain officials that there has been a assassination plot organized against one of the most supreme military leaders of our country, Kliment Voroshilov.

russoc.68.t:0 "The PLSR Question"
russoc.68.d:0 "The PLSR is the only syndicalist party in Russia. With syndicalism being the leading socialist ideology of the wider world in recent years, the Left SRs wield a great influence over population, army, and government.\nZhukov can successfully negotiate with the PLSR, if he did not 'soil his reputation' by connections with RKP.\nFrunze is unlikely to be supported by the PLSR as they still remember the times of the Left SRs uprising.\nHowever, it is Tukhachevsky who is likely to be supported by the Left SRs, as his Internationalist faction will be a nice platform for the PLSR to work with.\nThe only thing that can help us to sway the Left SRs to our cause is to grant them control over how the trade unions should be organised."

russoc.70.a:0 "As expected."

russoc.71.t:0 "The PLSR Supports Frunze"
russoc.71.d:0 "Against all odds and expectations, the PLSR will now be supporting their former enemy, the Bolshevik Mikhail Frunze. This unlikely and unstable alliance will likely catapult Frunze to the forefront of the race to take lead of the Troika."

russoc.85.t:0 "Troika Dissolved"
russoc.85.d:0 "The artificial and useless triumvirate, known as the 'Troika', has finally ceased to exist. With all the differences between the three titans that made up the council proving impossible to settle, a move has been made. With unconfirmed reports coming in from all across Moscow and the nation at large, all that can be determined is that one of the factions of the Troika has made its move and tried to topple the government in an attempt to seize the reigns of power in the [ROOT.GetName].

They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus want to break-up the smychka strongly, supporting the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction lead by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation, that is to extract the peasant surplus value and to use this to develop the productive forces to transition to make Russia ready for socialism, which is best developed in their mind through five-year plan."

The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."

Some have even evoked the program of collectivization to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozes) do not even pay their farmers a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destabilized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."

russoc.136.d:0 "One of the members of the PLSR and the leaders of the legalist wing, Isaak Zakharovich Steinberg, wrote and published a biography of the party leader Maria Alexandrovna Spiridonova. It tells her life path, starting from her work as a convict, joining the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and ending with becoming the leader of revolutionary Russia.\n\nThe fact that a difficult future awaits Maria became clear during her studies at the Tambov Women's Gymnasium. The girl often argued with teachers, demanding respect for human rights and criticizing the leadership. But, despite numerous scandals, Spiridonova was never expelled from the gymnasium, allowing her to graduate from an educational institution in 1902. At that time, her parents began to have financial problems, and Maria got a job as a clerk in the provincial noble assembly.\n\nSoon, the local Socialist-Revolutionaries drew attention to the active girl, who was distinguished by outstanding oratorical abilities. In her face, they saw the ideal candidate for the role of leader, capable of eloquence to make the crowd follow. And soon she joined the fighting squad of the party.\n\nAt numerous party meetings and protest demonstrations, Maria Alexandrovna felt like a fish in water. Her burning gaze and eloquence became her trademark "chips" - these skills led the girl to her first arrest. It happened in the spring of 1905, but soon Spiridonova was released.\n\nThe arrest and the general situation in the country led Maria Alexandrovna to the conclusion that it was necessary to achieve her goals in more radical ways. Protests and demonstrations did not cause the desired effect. By "radical methods" Spiridonova meant murder. The Socialist-Revolutionaries had an enemy - adviser to the Tambov provincial government Gavriil Luzhenovsky, who "distinguished himself" by unjustified cruelty during the suppression of peasant unrest in the Tambov region in 1905.\n\nAt the beginning of 1906, the Socialist-Revolutionary Committee decided to liquidate Luzhenovsky. The question arose: who dares to stain their hands in blood? Maria Alexandrovna volunteered. For several days, she followed the councilor's movements around the city and waited for the right moment. And when he arrived, the revolutionary took out a pistol and shot several times at Luzhenovsky. There is still no consensus on what happened next. According to one version, Spiridonova wanted to commit suicide, but the Cossacks managed to detain her. According to another, she began to walk from side to side, repeating: “I killed him! I killed him!"\nThis event became decisive for Spiridonova in her life. She spent over 10 years in prison when she was finally granted amnesty by the Provisional Government in 1917. \nHer further life is connected exclusively with the revolution: having taken an active part in the October Revolution and supporting the Bolsheviks, she became the most famous woman in Russia. But during the revolution, she made a number of mistakes - both the totalitarian bureaucratic Bolshevik Party and the petty-bourgeois party of the Right Socialist-Revolutionaries turned out to be her enemies. But if during the first revolution socialism collapsed, then the second revolution destroyed Russian capitalism and brought the socialist utopian ideas of Maria Alexandrovna to final triumph…"

He tried to explain to the crowd of thousands the true essence of the new ideology of the Soviet state - National Bolshevism.\n"National Bolshevism is by no means a new phenomenon for our Communist Party. National Bolshevism is primarily the ideology of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin. Lenin was the first National Bolshevik who raised a national liberation revolution against the British, German and French exploiters who held Russian people in slavery for more than 200 years.It was thanks to Vladimir Ilyich that the defeat of capitalism happened, which consisted in the nationalization of the property of the bourgeoisie, who had long lost any connection with the Russian people.The landlords and bourgeois hated everything Russian, spoke exclusively in French for centuries and oppressed Russian peasants and workers, considering them second-class people.Therefore, the Russian and other peoples of Russia supported the Bolshevik Party in its struggle against foreign invaders!Lenin in February 1918, during the offensive of the troops of the German imperialist power, issued a decree "The socialist fatherland is in danger", where urged the join the Red Army and fight the imperialists to the last drop of blood. It is indicative that the White Guards were able to defeat the state of workers and peasants only thanks to the help of the German imperialists, thereby proving that they are nothing more than their puppets and traitors to Russia.\nThanks to the second revolution, the true people's party of workers and peasants, the Bolshevik Party, was able to take power back into its own hands.\nThe essence of National Bolshevism is a sizzling hatred for the anti-human trinity system: liberalism/bourgeois democracy/capitalism. A man of rebellion, the National Bolshevik sees his mission in the destruction of the old system to the ground.

At the same time, he proposed to give power in the autonomous republics to members of the Communist Party from the nationalities of these republics. Molotov agreed with Comrade Frunze's proposals and already ordered the preparation of a state project for the implementation of these ideas."

Having expelled German and Japanese agents, saboteurs and saboteurs from the ranks of the Communist Party, the Bolsheviks are ready to begin the construction of genuine socialism according to the precepts of Marx, Engels and Lenin. Marxism-Leninism is the only real ideology of socialism. It is Marxism-Leninism that is destined to become the dominant ideology in Russia and then throughout the world. Only it is capable of leading the proletarian people to full, true happiness. Not the petty-bourgeois ideology of the Socialist-Revolutionaries or the Mensheviks, not the revisionism of Bukharin and the Western syndicalists, much less the ideology of the bourgeois Savinkov.

Being one of the leaders of the Bolshevik Central Committee in Yekaterinburg, he, together with Krestinsky, was preparing a proletarian uprising in the Urals. After the October Revolution, Sverdlov was appointed by Lenin to head the All-Russian Central Executive Committee (VTsIK). Yakov Mikhailovich was the creator of the world's first proletarian constitution - the constitution of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. This constitution consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in Russia. After the tragic death of Lenin, Sverdlov became one of the organizers of the Red Terror against the counter-revolution, signing directives on its beginning. In 1919, Sverdlov contracted the Spanish flu upon his return to Moscow. Died March 16, 1919.\nChairman Krestinsky ordered to forever perpetuate the memory of his comrade and comrade-in-arms, a faithful Leninist and Marxist. From now on, the city of Yekaterinburg will be called Sverdlovsk in order to forever leave Yakov Mikhailovich's mark in the history of Russia."

The main terror of the bourgeoisie, the Extraordinary Commission, was headed by him. The Cheka, along with the Red Army and the Red Navy, was one of the main shields of Soviet Russia. Dzerzhinsky's death was a tragedy for all true Bolshevik revolutionaries, especially for Comrade Blagonravov. That is why today Chairman Blagonravov instructed that the memory of \"Iron Felix\" be immortalized. Many villages, towns and even cities will be named after this great revolutionary. Comrade Blagonravov is ready to continue the cause of Vladimir Lenin and Felix Dzerzhinsky to the end! Long live Cheka Dzerzhinsky-Blagonravov! Long live the revolution!"

This really united the Social Revolutionaries and the former Bolsheviks, who became the NSP. But even more incredible is the fact that Spiridonova and Bukharin always acted as a united front, as one political unit. As early as 1918, at the time of the Brest-Litovsk Treaty, Bukharin, as leader of the Left Communists, supported the Left Socialist Revolutionaries in their anti-victory rhetoric. There were even rumors that Nikolai Ivanovich was ready to arrest Lenin in order to break the Brest Peace Treaty and continue the war with Germany. After the defeat of the Bolsheviks in 1920 and the creation of the People's Socialist Party in the mid-1920s, Bukharin again began to view the Left Socialist Socialists as potential allies. In the mid-1930s, a de facto political alliance was created between the NSP and the PLSR.\nNow both Nikolai Ivanovich and Maria Alexandrovna became leaders of socialist Russia. All of this gave rise to many rumors regarding their personal relationship.... some even joke that they had something of a love affair...... \nBut nevertheless, such a revolutionary unification of fragments of once great political parties should be an example to the peoples of socialist fronts of workers' parties all over the world!"

Burdjalov prepared a reform to transform Russian historical science. First of all, it concerns the evaluation of the role of Socialist-Revolutionaries and Narodniks in Russian history in general.  The leading role in the Russian Revolution of 1917, according to the journal, belongs to the leader of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries Maria Spiridonova, the leader of the Bolsheviks Vladimir Lenin and the leader of the Left Communists Nikolai Bukharin. Neutral or positive assessments are given to such revolutionaries as Stepan Razin, Kondrati Bulavin, Yemelyan Pugachev, Mikhail Bakunin, Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Vissarion Belinsky, and others.

After the February Revolution, she was elected to the Northern Regional and Petrograd Provincial Committees of the PSR and represented the SRs in the bureau of the Council of People's Socialist Parties. She also appeared on the pages of the party press. Thus, in the daily newspaper \"Land and Freedom\" her feuilleton was published under the title \"Czechs in Austria\".\nAt the III Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionaries (May 25 - June 4, 1917), Nadezhda Bryullova-Shaskolskaya was the main speaker on the national question. Bryullova-Shaskolskaya opposed the identification of the nation with the bourgeois state. In her speeches she defended the concept of the nation as a working people. According to this report, the Congress of the PSR spoke in favor of introducing in Russia \"a form of a federal democratic republic with territorial and national autonomy within the ethnographic settlement of peoples, with the basic laws of the country ensuring both the rights of national minorities in localities with a mixed population, and in general public rights for all the languages to be spoken by the working people of Russia.\" At the Central Course of the Society in commemoration of February 27, 1917 \"Culture and Freedom\" gave lectures \"The National Question\" and \"History of Revolutionary Movement in Russia\".\nAt the IV Congress of the Party, N. V. Bryullova-Shaskolskaya advocated the reorganization of the party on a federal basis and the unification of national socialist parties.\nAfter the revolution of the center-left Socialist Revolutionaries, Bryullova-Shaskolskaya initiated a project of unification of all peoples of Russia into a single whole. According to her plan, the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries should become an all-Union party that would unite all the peoples of Russia. Thus, she opposes both Great Russian nationalism and \"parochial\" nationalism."

russoc.159.d:0 "With the failures of Trotsky being painfully apparent to all during the Russian Civil War and the failed revolution, the old face of Communist Internationalism has been forced into a life of exile and disgrace, forever blacklisted from any self-respecting Socialist organization on Earth and formerly forever in hiding and on the run until he met his timely demise while attempting to cross the Bering Sea into Alaska, sinking beneath the frigid waters and icy waves, forever freeing the world from the stench of his failure. However, with his absence, a void was created - a void filled by Osip Aaronovitch Piatnitsky. \n\nBorn under the Tsardom in the Kovno Governorate to Jewish-Lithuanian parents, his original surname was Tarshis before he changed it to the pseudonym Piatnitsky to avoid the Okhrana’s purges, coming from the word Piatnitsa, or ‘Friday’ - his first Socialist revolutionary group made up of local union workers and tailors in his hometown. From these humble origins, ‘The Man Known as Friday’ as he was nicknamed rose to become a true revolutionary, joining Lenin in the Internationalist wing of the RSDLP and rising to the top while running a newspaper in the heart of the Eastern Front during the Great War. \n\nA contemporary of other Internationalists active in Russia such as the great General Tukhachevsky, Piatnitsky has risen to become the political and civilian face of Russian Internationalism, and he has worked hard to clean the image and reputation of his movement and thoughtform from the stain left by the foul failure he replaced. Going so far as to try to entirely erase the term ‘Trotskyism’ from the Russian lexicon as an alternative word for Russian International Communism, this new shining red star instead pushes the term Piatniskyism as a suitable replacement. Though he is without much support aside from his friends under the Red Napoleon in the Red Army, Piatnitsky is still a brilliant theorist and another example of a true Socialist patriot here in Russia."

### New Congress Focuses ###
SOV_Premier_Volsky:0 "Premier Volsky"
SOV_Premier_Volsky_desc:0 "Vladimir Volsky has been named the head of our Party. As an avid Socialist and supporter of the Revolution his appointment is seen as unsurprising by many. His devotion to the party goes back to 1903 and has since kept a close friendship with the Spiridonova. While, for one reason or another, Spiridonova herself was unable to secure leadership to many of her supporters, Volsky is the next best thing. Promising to return the PSR to its revolutionary roots he has gained many followers and now the establishment trembles as it waits for his next move."

SOV_Premier_Spiridonova:0 "Premier Spiridonova"
SOV_Premier_Spiridonova_desc:0 "The Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution, Maria Spiridonova has secured leadership over the Soviets. Under her leadership a revolutionary fire has been lit. Whether she will succeed where others failed however remains to be seen."

SOV_Premier_Bukharin:0 "NSP Victorious"
SOV_Premier_Bukharin_desc:0 "The NSP, the new cover for the Bolsheviks, has taken control over Russia. This is a 180 degree turn from the regime of the previous years and just a few months ago would’ve been seen as impossible. However, the impossible has indeed happened. Lenin gave his life for the Revolution and now the Revolution is complete, without Lenin and totally within the bounds of the Law. What happens next is going to shape the history of Russia and the world for generations.."

SOV_Premier_Bukharin_2:0 "Premier Bukharin"
SOV_Premier_Bukharin_2_desc:0 "Nikolai Bukharin, one of the last Old Bolsheviks still committed to the Revolution in Russia, has stayed as a head of the Party. This is an unsurprising development. While other old Bolsheviks reintegrated into Russian society or fled abroad, he remained in Russia. He was a close follower of Lenin but since the failure of the Revolution he has moved to the right. His support of the NEP and his thoughts on ‘Market Socialism’ have some questioning where his loyalties lie. In any case, he leads the Party now so where he goes, they all must follow."

SOV_Premier_Lozovsky:0 "Premier Lozovsky"
SOV_Premier_Lozovsky_desc:0 "Solomon Lozovsky has been elected to lead the Party. He is an unorthodox candidate, having fallen out with Lenin over the party's increased dictatorial slant under him. Instead he drew closer to the French unions during a stint in exile in the country in 1914. Now at the head of the Party he will probably seek to liberalize the party and mend the schisms of old. Whether he will succeed is another matter. No matter what he decides to do he will have to fight both internal and external dissention to do it."

SOV_A_New_Female_Image:0 "A New Female Image"
SOV_A_New_Female_Image_desc:0 "For too long the man has dominated the female. She has been expected to stay at home, tend to the house and remain little more than a slave to her husband. Premier Spiridonova has no qualms in revealing the hypocrisy of the Party, loudly promoting the equality of all while leaving women behind. Under her rule however there will be no patriarchal house slave relationship. All marriages will be equal unions, under the Law as well as any other measure. The New Soviet Woman will be strong and free, an equal pillar of any household. There will be grumbling from the conservatives but let them grumble. They will come crawling back to us when their wives taste true freedom and leave them behind."

SOV_Rural_Obschinas:0 "Rural Obschinas"
SOV_Rural_Obschinas_desc:0 "Obschina was once a Russian community of peasants and farmers, who live in the same village and share common ownership. With the socialization of land, the Obschinas are slowly coming back to life, improving cooperation and communalism between the rural dwellers."

SOV_Socialist_Democracy:0 "Socialist Democracy"
SOV_Socialist_Democracy_desc:0 "For many Socialism is synonymous with dictatorship. This is a holdover from the time of Lenin whose rule was almost as despotic as the Tsar he helped overthrow. We will remedy that problem. We will introduce democracy to the nation, true democracy equal as befitting the Socialist platform. This will endear us to the people and while Marx and Lenin may turn in their graves, times have changed and democracy is required for a state to function."

SOV_Socially_Owned_Economy:0 "Socially Owned Economy"
SOV_Socially_Owned_Economy_desc:0 "For too long a cabal of fat cat monopolies have owned large sectors of the Russian economy. This is simply untenable. Not only does this stifle any innovation and restrict the natural growth of our GDP, but it maintains the kleptocratic rule of the elites. We must smash these monopolies and localise the ownership of the factories if we are to solve this problem. The heavy hand of the state will work wonders in this endeavor. With our control over the apparatus of state there is little these holdovers of a bygone era can do against us. When we give the factories back to the people they will rejoice and work twice as hard. They will, won't they?"

SOV_Elect_New_Soviets:0 "Elect New Soviets"
SOV_Elect_New_Soviets_desc:0 "With our program already positively affecting the people we should make a move to sideline other factions of the Party. By electing new local Soviets across the nation we will accomplish many things. One, we will strengthen our mandate when the people turn out in droves to support our candidates. Two, we will sideline dissenting factions in the party. With us in control of many levels of government we can more effectively institute our agenda and bypass the internal party schisms that affect us."

SOV_Decentralised_Planning:0 "Decentralised Planning"
SOV_Decentralised_Planning_desc:0 "By instituting quotas and mandatory minimum production levels we will only hurt our nation. This will encourage lying and corruption should the quotas not be met. Therefore we will break down planning to a lower level and allow them to set their own production targets for the year. If these are met then the workers and their managers get rewards, if not, no harm done. With this system of Decentralized planning we can have a more effective economy."

SOV_Socialization_Of_Land:0 "Socialization of Land"
SOV_Socialization_Of_Land_desc:0 "Much of Russia’s land was not under control of common people for centuries. The Agrarian Project of SRs shall be finally realized in practice, as it was meant to be. While experts warn that this could have adverse effects and even cripple our already struggling agricultural sector, we will go ahead with this, damn the consequences."

SOV_Amnesty_To_Political_Prisoners:0 "Amnesty to Political Prisoners"
SOV_Amnesty_To_Political_Prisoners_desc:0 "Russia’s prisons are crushed by the weight of political prisoners swept up in the revolutionary fervor that followed our ascent to power. These men are largely old men and young boys who cannot hope to resist our rule now, even if they wanted to. To relieve the pressure on our strained system we will release the least dangerous of those political prisoners. While explicit counterrevolutionaries will of course be excluded from this amnesty by doing this not only will we free up cells for more deserving criminals but we will win more sympathy with the people, who will see this more as an act of kindness than anything else."

SOV_Labour_Republic:0 "Labour Republic"
SOV_Labour_Republic_desc:0 "The narodnik concept of the structure of Russia as a Labor Republic of the Soviets is the most successful variant of the development of our Motherland. Despite the fact that the concept was corrupted by the Bolsheviks, its true meaning is in the people's power and representation through the Soviets, and not in the power of a single party."

SOV_Farmers_Instead_Of_Peasants:0 "Farmers Instead of Peasants"
SOV_Farmers_Instead_Of_Peasants_desc:0 "While to anybody else a peasant is a farmer we know differently. The Peasants do not own their farms like farmers, they rent them from landlords who barely know what they own. This also means that peasants have little motivation to farm more than they absolutely need. However, if we were to seize the land from the landlords and give them to the people who actually work that land, they could be motivated to not only farm for subsistence, but in excess for the greater good of the people."

SOV_Soyuzmultfilm:0 "Soyuzmultfilm"
SOV_Soyuzmultfilm_desc:0 "We have created an animation studio composed of talented individuals from all over the union, as well as with the support and expertise of foreign defectors from Japan and the USA, built from the nationalized carcass of the two largest animator groups based in Moscow. Rebuilt and rebranded, this new, state-run institution is expected to bring the joys of Socialist thought to the masses, and especially to our youth, through pre-approved programming and quality animation. Already, Soyuzmultfilm has begun to touch the hearts of thousands across Russia as masters of the craft such as Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Vladimir Suteev, Olga Khodataeva, Vladimir Polkovnikov, Leonid Amalrik, the Brumberg sisters, and many others work endlessly to churn out new media for the masses to consume. With these enlightening, entertaining hand-drawn animations being churned out, we shall entice and educate the masses with the true glory of Socialist artistic expression."

SOV_Tax_The_Workers:0 "Tax the Workers"
SOV_Tax_The_Workers_desc:0 "Any nation runs on money, even a paradise such as ours. We will put down a tax code focused on the Workers. As the richest of the sympathetic classes we can use them to gain more money while also putting that money to good use in social programs to help them. The taxes won't be as stifling as they were under Kerensky but any taxes will be unpopular. However we have no choice, whether it's this or bankruptcy. "

SOV_Down_With_Nep:0 "Down with NEP"
SOV_Down_With_Nep_desc:0 "The NEP is just capitalism in red paint! Bukharin came up with it in an attempt to win over the bourgeois. However the private ownership of land, and the extraction of profits from said land, is not Socialist doctrine. It has alienated us from other left wing parties we could use to boost our power and as such its more of a liability than a strength. We will abandon Bukharin’s pseudo-capitalism"

SOV_Tax_The_Peasants:0 "Tax the Peasants"
SOV_Tax_The_Peasants_desc:0 "We must focus our tax code on the more numerous peasant class. While not materially wealthy they have other ways of payment. If money can not be given they can give up a portion of their harvest or, if they have no extra to spare, can work on public projects for a certain amount of time. This rises bile in the more idealistic Bolshevik’s mouths as they see this as just punching down. However focusing on the workers as they suggest would just bankrupt our growing middle class, something that would tank any modern economy."

SOV_A_Paradise_For_Workers:0 "A Paradise For Workers"
SOV_A_Paradise_For_Workers_desc:0 "We have achieved the impossible and made Russia a true paradise for workers. Everybody knows what they are doing and why and the government coordinates everything to make sure nothing is wasted. Claimed inefficiencies are simply fabrications as our prosperity is proof enough of our success. Meanwhile our nation reaches new levels of prosperity day over day."

SOV_Premier_Tomsky:0 "Premier Tomsky"
SOV_Premier_Tomsky_desc:0 "Mikhail Tomsky, prominent Trade Unionist, has been elected to lead the Party and State. As a Trade Unionist many consider his loyalties to the Bolshevik orthodoxy suspect. Few however can doubt his true convictions. He is an avid supporter of the democratic process, the trade unions who form his powerbase and the factory workers who make them up. With him at the head of the Soviet state there is little doubt that a new, kinder regime is on the way in, a severe change from the Dictatorship of the Proletariat spoken of by Lenin and Marx."

RUS_Strengthen_Trade_Unions:0 "Strengthen Trade Unions"
RUS_Strengthen_Trade_Unions_desc:0 "For workers to be liberated the trade unions must have more say in the political sphere. By increasing their powers we can ensure that they’ll have greater influence on the ruling of the country."

SOV_Industrial_Democracy:0 "Industrial Democracy"
SOV_Industrial_Democracy_desc:0 "Syndicalist vision for union control over the economy has succeeded in winning over a majority of delegates and chairmen in our soviets."

SOV_Separate_Trade_Unions_From_Party:0 "Separate Trade Unions from Party"
SOV_Separate_Trade_Unions_From_Party_desc:0 "Trade Unions cannot act as they should if they are little more than puppets of state control. We must depoliticise the Trade Unions so they can act in their members best interest and not explicitly the States. This has already drawn ire from the more suspicious members of our political sphere who see the Unions as a vulnerability able to be used by counterrevolutionaries to influence the state away from Socialism. However, countermeasures are already in place to ensure that any populists in disguise are being weeded out. Besides, the worker loves the state and would do nothing to harm it."

SOV_Premier_Rykov:0 "Premier Rykov"
SOV_Premier_Rykov_desc:0 "We have elected the Old Bolshevik Aleksey Rykov to lead the party. While some in the party, like Rykov’s friend Tomsky, wanted to federalize the state and give the Republics more autonomy, Rykov himself has pledged to consolidate power more under the Premier and resist the turn to Syndicalism that has permeated the left. This has led some to worry that Rykov seeks to become a dictator but Rykov stresses that the state can have a centralized authority and follow the democratic socialist process as well. Time will tell if he can uphold his promise."

SOV_Premier_Kirov:0 "Premier Kirov"
SOV_Premier_Kirov_desc:0 "Sergey Kirov has become Premier of our new state. As a Centralist he has made many enemies in the Party but his populism has made him widely popular among the general populace. This popularity has lent our regime a new degree of stability and legitimacy that it previously lacked. Kirov has declared that with the people on our side there is little we cannot do, and many have begun to agree with him."

SOV_Peoples_Premier:0 "People's Premier"
SOV_Peoples_Premier_desc:0 "Sergey Kirov is one of the most popular men in Russia right now, hands down. He has been especially attractive to the women of Russia who send him literally tons of mail professing their love, seemingly not knowing or wilfully forgetting the fact that Kirov is a married man. Despite that his personal charisma has enraptured the nation and the People have united under him, ready to follow him in all his future endeavors. With such universal domestic acclaim  there is little that remains outside his reach."

SOV_National_Communist_Doctrine:0 "Centralist Doctrine"
SOV_National_Communist_Doctrine_desc:0 "Many still wonder if Premier Rykov is devoted to his Centralism or if he will simply allow the status quo to continue. Rykov however, has no intention of letting the status quo limp forwards. Giving too much autonomy to the provinces and republics of our nation is a disaster waiting to happen. Giving them the chance to openly disagree with the government will waste valuable time in getting a consensus when such a state should already be assumed. So, Rykov has decided to announce his commitment to Centralising the state in a speech today and let no man wonder what Rykov’s goals may be."

SOV_Complete_Nationalization:0 "Complete Nationalization"
SOV_Complete_Nationalization_desc:0 "If you give capitalists an inch they will take a mile. We cannot allow private ownership within our state. We have already done so much to destroy the bourgeois, to let them reestablish themselves would be criminal. We shall nationalize all business within Russia. Everything from the grandest mines to the smallest store will be seized for the betterment of us all."

SOV_Hypercentralization:0 "Hypercentralization"
SOV_Hypercentralization_desc:0 "We should not only centralize our state and economy, we should ensure that is all in control of the Party and government. Without total control, we will soon face inefficiencies that will prevent our economy from becoming a leading industrial power."

SOV_Creating_An_Efficient_Economy:0 "Creating an Efficient Economy"
SOV_Creating_An_Efficient_Economy_desc:0 "Or mass nationalization has been done haphazardly and without much thought. Red tape smothers many factories and confusing spheres of authority has caused some infighting between various Commissariats. Bad actors within the system have exploited this inefficiency for profit and already our economy is feeling the weight of our sagging production. We must trim down on this excess fat if we are to achieve greatness. "

SOV_Centralized_Republic:0 "Centralized Republic"
SOV_Centralized_Republic_desc:0 "We have fully centralized the state into our hands. While in other people's view this may be seen as authoritarian and dictatorial. However, within our nation we have proven our good intentions. The people work in the factories, owned and provided for by the state, go to homes paid for by the state and live in cities maintained by the state. The state oversees all and makes sure all of its children live long, happy and healthy. The people have a direct stake in working as well since the more they work the more the state can invest back into them. It truly is a workers paradise."

SOV_The_Workers_Constitution:0 "The Workers' Constitution"
SOV_The_Workers_Constitution_desc:0 "Constitutions have, throughout history, been made by and for the interests of big business and the kleptocracies that run most capitalist nations. They speak highly of the inherent and inalienable rights of the nation's people while the politicians work diligently to undermine those rights so their friends can make another dollar. Our nation however has revealed the first true Workers’ Constitution, built by and for the Workers of our nation. The rights of freedom of speech, assembly, association, press and thought among many others are the first declarations of this new Constitution. It also mandates vacation days, time off work, equal rights for all, among many many others. All in all the Workers’ Constitution is longer than the famed Constitution of the US, upheld by many as the template for democracy, and contains many of the rights that were not in the original. Now the worker may bask in its protections, safe from all discrimination."

SOV_Peasants_Republic:0 "The Workers' and Peasants' Republic"
SOV_Peasants_Republic_desc:0 "We have founded a Republic based and run by the Workers and Peasants. The typical republic quickly devolves into an elitist and populist hellscape where the worker toils for years with no hope of liberation. In our new Republic however the people are and will always be the driver of political force. The power pyramid goes from the bottom up and not the top down. Many figure that this populist slant will leave us vulnerable to ideologues but we know the people will not be so easily seduced by words alone. Our struggles prove that the people demand action, something only we can give them and they reward us handsomely."

SOV_Premier_Kuznetsov:0 "Premier Kuznetsov"
SOV_Premier_Kuznetsov_desc:0 "Premier Bukharin is dead! In an emergency meeting the Central Committee has elected Alexey Kuznetsov to lead the nation. Kuznetsov’s election heralds a radical shift away from the ideals of Bukharin. Kuznetsov’s positions include abolishing the Union and centralizing all the Republics into autonomies under the Russian state and opposing the NEP, the brainchild of Bukharin. Some condemn him as a reactionary and as a Russian supremacist but that seems to have not done anything to dissuade his supporters. Nevertheless with Kuznetsov at the helm the Union is careening down an uncertain path that will lead it to evermore greatness or destroy it entirely."

SOV_Premier_Ryutin:0 "Premier Ryutin"
SOV_Premier_Ryutin_desc:0 "With Premier Bukharin dead the Central Committee has elected Martemyan Ryutin as the new Premier. While a supporter of Bukharin, Ryutin also maintains a closer ideological relation to Lenin. This signifies a break from the strict Bukharinist that many expected the Party to tow while still not alienating Bukharin’s many followers and allies within the Party. Some of Ryutin’s principle pillars are the opposition to the radical industrialization of the nation which he claims to have had a severe effect on the economic life of the peasant. While he does still support industrialization he instead wishes it to be more measured than the rapid growth many other leaders hope for. However, with many of our neighbors both hostile and fully industrialized worries persist that a slower path to industrialization will leave us vulnerable should the Germans come."

SOV_Premier_Kosygin:0 "Premier Kosygin"
SOV_Premier_Kosygin_desc:0 "The death of Premier Bukharin has required a new vote to who would take over. This has had the expected result of pushing Alexei Kosygin to lead the nation. As a staunch Bukharinist and a close friend and ally of the former Premier, few doubted his nomination was anything less than inevitable. Under his rule it is expected the nation will continue to reform along the path laid by Bukharin."

SOV_Cooperative_Economy_desc:0 "A nation needs an economy that works for all and not the few at the top. That is why we will continue to form our new economy around the cooperatives that have sprung up on Bukharin’s insistence. With everybody working in tandem with each other and profiting equally from their labor they will be further motivated to even greater heights of prosperity. Hand in hand we shall make the Soviet economy the greatest in the world!"

SOV_Strengthen_Khozraschyot_System:0 "Strengthen Khozraschyot System"
SOV_Strengthen_Khozraschyot_System_desc:0 "The Khozraschyot System is a contradiction in that it’s both a revolutionary institution while also being common sense. With the State footing the bill for much of our industry they have been allowed to grow beyond their means. This has left factories underutilized and inefficient. We shall begin to roll back our subsidies and oversight to force business to reel itself back in. This will lead to a certain amount of businesses' shuttering as their model collapses without the blank check given to them by the government but that is for the best. It's like culling the herd. The sick and weak must die for the rest of us to grow stronger."

SOV_Capitalism_In_City:0 "Capitalism in City?"
SOV_Capitalism_In_City_desc:0 "A truly radical proposition has come before us for approval. It proposes that we allow some large cities within our nation, the ones recommended being Moscow and Petrograd, to practice measured capitalism outside our State run apparatus. These cities, termed as Free Economic Zones, will be used to entice investment from foreign companies while our strict oversight maintains said pollution remains confined to these cities. Some within our party have pushed for this for some time. They claim outside investment will only boost our economy to higher heights. Meanwhile the rest of the Party has reacted severely to this. They claim this is a naked attempt to undercut the Revolution and everything it stands for. They argue introducing capitalism, no matter how ‘measured’ , will just give the international bourgeoisie a toehold in our nation to undermine our government and encourage counterrevolution. Despite their protests however the proposal has been passed, now we wait to see if their predicted apocalypse comes to pass. "

SOV_Full_Market_Socialism:0 "Full Market Socialism"
SOV_Full_Market_Socialism_desc:0 "With the radical economic changes having been instituted as of late we have moved closer than ever to instituting Market socialism. This differs as the government will step back from all non-labor based jobs like those in the service industry. These industries will be allowed to self regulate and operate but still be publicly owned. The profits from such ventures will be given back to the employees or reinvested into social programs."

SOV_Allow_Urban_Cooperatives:0 "Allow Urban Cooperatives"
SOV_Allow_Urban_Cooperatives_desc:0 "Before now most of the cooperatives within our nation were farmers co-ops based in the countryside. However, many in the factories and cities of our nation have begun to attempt to form cooperatives of their own. Before then they have been approved on a case by case basis for various reasons. However, now with our economy in full swing we have deemed the time right to extend the cooperative system into the cities as well. Factories, public transportation and shops and stores will all be able to unite into cooperatives to better manage themselves and return the workers power to their workplace."

SOV_Bukharinist_Platform_desc:0 "Premier Bukharin was a crusader for the people! A close confidant of Lenin, standard bearer of the Revolution after Lenin’s death and the vanguard of the Party for its existence since the Civil War we shall honor him like he deserves. We shall raise him to the equal status of Soviet Hero of the People and explain to everybody just how critical he was in them acquiring the freedoms they now enjoy. Even now, after death he watches over the Revolution and guides it forwards to its inevitable conclusion, the unification of the World Proletariat."

SOV_Peoples_Economy:0 "People's Economy"
SOV_Peoples_Economy_desc:0 "With our economy humming along we have hard numbers to prove that our economic theories have real legs to stand on. When we first came to power few expected our success. We were said to be naive idealists whose failure will give ‘more sensible’ ideas the opportunity to take the limelight. Their predictions have now however been proven to be manifestly false. The people are prosperous, our economy rivals any other on the planet and Soviet goods are exported across the world to be eagerly bought by those who marvel at the ingenuity of the Soviet Worker. With the success of our Revolution, comrades across the globe are encouraged that they will be able to bring the Revolution to their homes as well."

SOV_Peoples_Enterprises:0 "People's Enterprises"
SOV_Peoples_Enterprises_desc:0 "As part of our radical economic program we have allowed private business ownership within the state system. This has been a major risk as it could have easily inspired latent reactionary capitalist retaliation. However, our system of People’s Enterprises has worked wonders. People own their business and keep a portion of the profits while handing the rest over to the local cooperative. This cooperative then distributes it to needy businesses or invests in local social wellbeing programs like homeless shelters. This has both stimulated economic growth and rejuvenated the decaying cityscapes that dotted our nation."

SOV_Leninist_Platform:0 "Leninist Platform"
SOV_Leninist_Platform_desc:0 "We have stuck to the Path of Lenin and it has paid dividends. Our people are happy, our nation prospers and the Revolution has never been stronger. When Lenin was shot dead in the dark days of 1918 many feared his cause, the cause of the People, was to be forever crushed under the heavy boot of reaction. However Premier Ryutin has made him proud as the inheritor to the Revolution. By merging the ideas of Bukharin and Lenin he has formed the perfect brand of socialism which has finally had its chance to prove itself on the world stage. As we grow ever more powerful under the band of Leninist-Bukharinism the forces of international reaction cower in fear. Our success has emboldened their people to take the rights they are owed and the Revolution grows ever closer to home."

Instead we will not stop until all people are equal to each other and no man can dominate another. While the worldwide proletariat will get their liberation in due time at their own hands or ours, we first must focus on the internal sphere. Russophilia within the Union is rampant with many Russians feeling that, as the largest component of the Union, they deserve to dominate it. To counter this we will allow talented men from the other Republics to rise to public positions of prominence and show to the world and our people that this is not a Russian union, but a Union of Equals, a Union of People."

SOV_Soviet_Middle_Class_desc:0 "The Middle Class is the cornerstone to a consumer economy like ours. Until now we had a modest middle class with most people falling into the classification of poor laborer or the destitute. We must stimulate the growth of the middle class to stimulate the growth of the economy. We will institute a universal basic income, raise the minimum wage and start a program to house all of the Union’s people. With their basic needs met people can focus on luxuries like vacations and more importantly, social spending at places like restaurants and shops."

SOV_Enrich_Yourself_desc:0 "Socialism should not require poverty. To many the idea of a rich socialist seems to be an oxymoron. However, within our nation we have slowly grown a new class of wealthy people. However, these people are different from their compatriots in other nations in that they know the value of community and philanthropy. Not only will wealth caps make sure they do not accrue too large a hoard, but their constant donations to their local areas and to social programs has kept them well off, but not moguls like existed in the West. This shows the true power of our state. Not only have we shaped a compassionate and egalitarian economy, but we have also tamed the most reactionary of classes, the wealthy."

The central tenet of this belief is the idea of subjecting the various Republics of the Union into autonomies under Russia, a National Syndicate as it were. This has angered the minorities within the Union and has led many of the Republics to threaten to secede. We know our cause is righteous. We can overcome them, we will overcome them. Let them shout until they are blue in the face, it can’t change the future."

SOV_Oppose_Unionists_desc:0 "The Union is a weak thing. The Republics are all equal in the eyes of the law and therefore overlapping authority has left many things unfinished as bureaucrats bicker over who should take precedence. This has crippled any cross-Republic trade as well. Not only that but populists could easily take over a Republic or two and throw the whole Union into chaos! We must expose the weaknesses of the Union to the people and make the case that it needs to be replaced if we are to have true safety and security. This will boost our share of the people’s support while also undercutting the many Unionists still within the government."

Our Revolution sought to do away with the arbitrary differences and unite the people behind the one Struggle for International Liberation. Then Bukharin came to power. With his proto-capitalist doctrine the old classist lines have once again been forged as the have nots once more toil away for the benefit of the haves. Except this time the upper crust claims to do what it does for the benefit of the lower classes. This naked hypocrisy cannot stand. Just like before we will break the boundaries of class and this time we will make sure they will not form again. We will have total equality and as a result, total class unity, and the people will finally get the freedom from class oppression they so hoped for."

Until now most of the workers operated in Soviets with varying degrees of autonomy from the State. This cannot stand. If Russia is to remain the vanguard of the International Proletarian Revolution then it must stand as such united and focused in purpose. To that end we shall abolish the Soviets and instead reconstitute them as Syndicates. These Syndicates will be under stricter state control and more effectively and efficiently manage the areas they oversee. Meanwhile any disputes between the Syndicates will be solved by the State, rather than by the long and complex system of arbitration as with the Soviets."

If we let them go on like they are, it will be a matter of when they tear the nation apart, not if. To that end Kuznetzov has decreed the immediate dissolution of the Republics. This decree has been met with uproarious anger from the Republics and many have begun to openly discuss leaving the Union. This is flagrantly illegal and also, conveniently, just the pretext we need for this new purge. We shall use any means necessary to upend the dissentious Unionist control over the Republics and replace them with men more amicable to our cause. This will be very risky, some will not come quietly and we are already alerting the Army to respond to potential revolts. However the Red of the Revolution comes from the blood shed by the heroes who fought for it. By the end of this deluge there will be plenty more of heroes' blood seeping into the Russian earth."

We shall reign in their autonomy under the All Russian Central Congress of Trade Unions.

A former member of the RKP, Zhdanov abandoned the Zinovievist party over disagreements with their interpretation of the ideological works of Lenin. Eventually, he joined the NSP and became aligned with the Centralist wing, becoming the man in charge of the agricultural sector after Aleksey Rykov's election.

Their fears of an uncertain future were quickly dashed by Premier Zhdanov's announcement of the creation of the Central Commission of State Planning, under his recent protégé Nikolay Voznesensky.

Such lapses must be combated at every step, lest they threaten to tear the Soviet society apart. This is why Premier Zhdanov authorized the creation of a special People's Commissariat, modeled after the revolutionary VChK, dubbed the 'Judges of Honour' by the more zealous Party members. Their main job is to make sure that the Party itself doesn't stray in any way from the ideological purity presented by Andrei Zhdanov.

Yet the greatest among us, Andrei Zhdanov, realized the truth of how the Party may rot in the future.

The VSFK also manages various governmental duties like ratifying treaties and approving bills. In short, the VSFK is exceptionally powerful. If a demagogue were to take over the body then the Revolution would be threatened if not totally reversed. To combat their power we will break off many of the local Syndicates, making them answerable to regional bodies rather than directly to the Congress.

This has left them vulnerable to price gouging and forces them to race to the bottom in price to beat out their competition.

Across our nation people vote in elections to choose delegates who directly execute their will. Cut off from the temptation of international capital they strive for the best Russia can be, untainted by corruption.

Others point out that the remaining kulaks are less the exploitative lords overlooking their innumerable peasants that the radicals paint them to be and are instead more or less cooperatives just not under a state appointed leader.

Since we have destroyed the Cheka and restored sanity to the nation, such suspicion is lifting but still hangs over us like a heavy blanket. We must work to restore order and trust between the people and government and between the people and their neighbors. Without these basic building blocks of society our nation is lost to anarchy."

SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power:0 "Give Up Monopoly On Power"
SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power_desc:0 "The Cheka consolidated power to an extreme degree leaving the entire state dependent on the executive and his puppet masters. Now that we are in charge we will do away with this. We will restore the previous balance of power by re-delegating key responsibilities to the restored ministries and branches of government. With the government no longer entirely dependent on one man we can act faster and restore the democracy which has long been little more than a facade."

SOV_No_Need_In_Terror:0 "Abandon Terror"
SOV_No_Need_In_Terror_desc:0 "Under the Cheka mass executions of suspected enemies of the state were commonplace. Hundreds died in cities across the nation every day and ammunition was expended in such numbers that in some areas the local Cheka death squads returned to sabers and clubs to do the deed due to a lack of ammunition. As the story of the Cheka comes to its merciful close we will also abandon the state sanctioned terror they brought with them. We will loosen the stringent restraints on people's lives, eliminate the death squads entirely and instead restore the local police forces that had for some time now fallen by the wayside."

SOV_Elect_The_New_Chairman:0 "Elect the New Chairman"
SOV_Elect_The_New_Chairman_desc:0 "Our mission is complete. The government has been restored, people are learning to trust one another again and the Cheka have been broken and destroyed in totality. There is no longer any threat of them ever rising again and we have taken steps to make sure any future government never makes the same mistake we did. Now, we have only one mission left: turn over leadership back to the civilian government. While some have entertained the notion of a permanent State of Emergency to rule that idea lasted about as long as a daisy on the tundra. We are here to restore democracy, not destroy it. To finalize the return to normalcy we shall organize a new election for a new chairman, restored to full powers by us."

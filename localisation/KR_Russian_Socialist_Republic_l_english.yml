### Focuses ###
Russia_Socialist: "Russian Focus Tree"

SOV_Proletarian_Humanism: "Proletarian Humanism"
SOV_Proletarian_Humanism_desc: "Through his rhetorical skills and clever maneuvering, Bukharin's vision of Russia and beyond has seen him retain his dominant role at the Congress. He supports a course of socialism at a snail's pace, to avoid the creation of a massive state bureaucracy and preserve the victories of the proletariat in the recent revolution."

SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict: "Fight Urban-Rural Conflict"
SOV_Fight_Urban_Rural_Conflict_desc: "In our land there is a great struggle between the cities and the countryside, between the developed lands and the deprived farmlands, between factory workers and peasants. One of our first steps in preserving the revolution is to overcome this divide so that we may combine our efforts against the oppressors rather than bickering among ourselves."

SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation: "Voluntary Collectivisation"
SOV_Voluntary_Collectivisation_desc: "Russia had barely begun to move beyond feudalism by the time we liberated the country. The New Economic Policy of the Soviet Republic should include a program of voluntary farm collectivisation, something that will allow the poorest peasants to unite and pool their resources together without uprooting the entire agricultural system."

SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation: "Cautious Industrialisation"
SOV_Cautious_Industrialisation_desc: "The super industrialism of the left-wing of the party will lead to a massive state bureaucracy which will dominate over the proletariat. Only a moderate industrialisation, one which also preserves the Smychka, which is a necessary requirement in the short-term, will be a successful one, preventing many issues in its path."

SOV_Control_The_Unions: "Control the Unions"
SOV_Control_The_Unions_desc: "We currently have a parallelism of unions and the administrative organs, an issue which needs to be remedied. While this we will also have to change the essence of unions, from 'trade' unions to 'production' unions. The newly created administrative-economic apparatus will be democratically elected by the workers, with broad mass assemblies of all economic-production measures."

SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation: "Fight Bureaucratisation"
SOV_Fight_Bureaucratisation_desc: "The fight against the bureaucracy is a constant struggle, something Lenin already well understood. We will have to continue Comrade Lenin’s fight against the bureaucracy, before it can take hold like a tick and drain our state’s lifeblood of liberty and equality; something we must avoid at all costs. We will also have to train a new class of truly proletarian bureaucrats to slowly replace the scores of reactionary swine that still infest our administration."

SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard: "Revolutionary Vanguard"
SOV_Revolutionary_Vanguard_desc: "After a long struggle, Karl Radek's vision for a revolutionary future has won out against all others. A radical among radicals, Radek is a firebrand, insisting that primitive socialist accumulation and a series of five-year plans will allow the production of the productive forces necessary to begin the transition towards true communism."

SOV_Mass_Collectivisation: "Dekulakization"
SOV_Mass_Collectivisation_desc: "The farmlands of Russia's great expanses have never been controlled by the farmer, but instead by the Grand Prince, the Tsar, and the capitalist. But now there is another enemy in the village - the Kulak, a capitalist farmer, who seeks only profit margin. This repression of the worker cannot be allowed to persist, and as such we must embark on a radical program of dekulakization of our agricultural industry. Only under collective ownership can they truly be free from the capitalist's jackboot."

SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour: "Militarisation of Labour"
SOV_Militarisation_of_Labour_desc: "Man, at its basis, wants to avoid work. Thus, we must use state coercion to establish a society based around the interests of the labouring majority. Labour armies will be established, mobilising the proletariat to work under military supervision. We must also fight labour deserters who want to sabotage the great revolution."

SOV_Proletarian_Revolution: "Proletarian Revolution"
SOV_Proletarian_Revolution_desc: "The revolution must be complete and all-encompassing. For socialism to be achieved we must put all our efforts towards its accomplishment and radically change society from top to bottom. Only by removing the rotten core left behind by the previous regime can the workers truly be free from its oppression."

SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan: "First Five-Year Plan"
SOV_First_Five_Year_Plan_desc: "The taxation of the peasantry, and thus taking the surplus value of the peasants, will allow for the productive forces to transition to socialism. This is best done through a central planning agency creating plans which allow for rapid industrialisation. The mainstay of these plans shall be the 5-Year Plans: set economic plans with goals to reach within the allotted time to keep our industrialization efforts on track and at rapid pace."


SOV_Break_The_Smychka: "Break The Smychka"
SOV_Break_The_Smychka_desc: "As a result of centuries of feudal and capitalist rule, Russia has few true peasants. It's therefore inconceivable that the farmer will be at the center of the revolution, albeit through no fault of their own. No, it's the worker and not the peasant that will be the vanguard of the revolution, and he should be elevated as such."

SOV_Create_the_VSR: "Create the VSR"
SOV_Create_the_VSR_desc: "By establishing the All-Russian Union of Producers (VSR - Vserossiyskiy Soyuz Rabochikh), the trade unions will be granted a far greater influence over labour and the economy as a whole. In the end, this will serve to strengthen the worker and the Union alike."

SOV_Separation_Of_Powers: "Separation of Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Powers_desc: "The interest of the unions have been ignored far too much, we will create a separation of power between the unions, the Soviets and the Communist Party, which will allow to represent the proletariat while also allowing for the effective defence against reactionaries."

SOV_Rebuild_the_Country: "Rebuild the Country"
SOV_Rebuild_the_Country_desc: "While recent years have seen some of the worst of it, the Russian lands have been ravaged by the scourges of war and tyranny for the entirety of our living memory. The process of rebuilding the country will be a long and difficult one, and one that we must focus all our efforts towards."

SOV_Help_The_People: "Help the People"
SOV_Help_The_People_desc: "The Second Russian Civil War has devastated large swaths of the nation, it has also impoverished many people. We will have to fix this disaster and end the great suffering created for many by the Civil War, else we would be failing at our central mission to improve the living situation of the general population."

SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy: "Rebuild the Bureaucracy"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Bureaucracy_desc: "Kerensky's reign and its aftermath hardly improved matters from the times of the Tsars. If we are to have a functioning state apparatus capable of serving the workers rather than the interests of a handful of capitalists and their cronies, the entire state bureaucracy must be rebuilt from the ground up."

SOV_Allow_Small_Traders: "Allow Small Traders"
SOV_Allow_Small_Traders_desc: "In order to allow for a smoother transition to a socialist economy, a limited amount of commerce will be permitted within non-essential sectors of the economy. After all, the common man operating a small store is not that far removed from the worker on a factory floor and equating him with an industrial baron would create needless harm to the masses."

SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan: "Electrify Rural Areas"
SOV_The_GOELRO_Plan_desc: "Electrification is a central part for communism. Lenin went so far as to state that 'Communism is Soviet government plus the electrification of the whole country.' Despite the electifaction, made by Kerensky government, it is still not enough. To fulfil this plan we have entrusted a 'State Commission for Electrification of Russia' to electrify the entire nation."

SOV_Form_Gosplan: "Form Gosplan"
SOV_Form_Gosplan_desc: "In order to complete our lofty economic goals, a planning committee will need to be established by the state. This Gosudarstvennyy Planovyy Komitet, or Gosplan, shall serve as the main economic planning office in our nation, precisely dictating how our economy shall operate. Employing some of the brightest minds in Russia, the Gosplan will greatly enhance our new planned economy."

SOV_Mechanisation: "Mechanisation"
SOV_Mechanisation_desc: "The industrial revolution brought with it many great advancements in productivity as factories and farmlands started to utilise machinery on a grand scale. Yet here in Russia, most labour is done by hand. In order to compete with the capitalists that oppose us at every turn, we must embrace these developments and modernise our economy accordingly."

SOV_Khozraschyot: "Khozraschyot"
SOV_Khozraschyot_desc: "A socialist economy cannot be created overnight. One of the early transitional steps as outlined in the New Economic Policy of the Russian Socialist Republic will require that certain elements of the free market model are emulated for the time being, something that in the short term will see greater developments in light rather than heavy industries."

SOV_Promote_Industrialisation: "Promote Industrialisation"
SOV_Promote_Industrialisation_desc: "We do not exist in a vacuum. In order to modernise our economy into a socialist model, we have to participate in the global market on some level, in order to achieve the amount of capital needed to procure the machinery and knowledge. The best way of achieving this is to establish a series of state trusts that can finance these ventures, while allowing our internal economy to stay separate from international capitalism."

SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution: "Spreading the Revolution"
SOV_Spreading_The_Revolution_desc: "The revolution will not be contained within just the borders of Russia. The worker abroad must be freed from tyranny as well and it's our duty to aid them in their struggle."

SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits: "Force Open the Straits"
SOV_Force_Open_The_Straits_desc: "We're no strangers to conflict with the Ottomans. In the past however, monarchs fought against each other for the sake of pride and prizes. Now it is the people that will fight against the monarchs for the sake of worker liberation."

SOV_Into_The_Caucasus: "Into the Caucasus"
SOV_Into_The_Caucasus_desc: "Lost after the Weltkrieg, the Don-Kuban Union is a reactionary state run by Cossack warlords. Beyond their tyranny lies counter-revolutionaries and religious fundamentalists right at the edge of the theocratic Islamic Empire in the south. As long as they remain at large, these states pose an active threat to our revolution."

SOV_Secure_Central_Asia: "Secure Central Asia"
SOV_Secure_Central_Asia_desc: "Formerly part of Russia, the central Asian plains have since fallen to despotic Khans and their militant hordes. To bring Russian leadership to these lands wouldn't just be an act of self-defence on our part, but also an act of liberation of the downtrodden that live under the yoke of these warlords."

SOV_The_Final_Battle: "The Final Battle"
SOV_The_Final_Battle_desc: "The treaty of Brest-Litovsk handed over millions of workers to the German industrialists on a silver platter and gave them Russia's most heavily industrialised lands on top of it. It's our duty to liberate the people of the East from the German yoke once and for all."

SOV_Enemy_In_The_East: "Enemy in the East"
SOV_Enemy_In_The_East_desc: "The Empire of Japan holds a large portion of Asia's workers hostage under its despotic military rule. These workers and peasants of Asia yearn to be freed from Japan and her band of warlords and only Russian might is capable of achieving this!"

SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias: "Mobilise Urban Militias"
SOV_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc: "The cities have been the heartland of the revolution ever since the beginning - they were its birth land. We must rally militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for its spread, for if we do not, the revolution may be crushed yet again."

SOV_Rally_The_Defectors: "Rally the Defectors"
SOV_Rally_The_Defectors_desc: "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."

SOV_The_War_Effort: "The War Effort"
SOV_The_War_Effort_desc: "We will need to organise the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "

SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army: "Rebuild the Red Army"
SOV_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army will have to be rebuilt, if we want to win this revolution.

Even so, we must be aware of the failures and mistakes of its first incarnation."

SOV_Establish_The_VVS: "Establish the VVS"
SOV_Establish_The_VVS_desc: "The VVS (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, 'Military Air Force') is badly outdated. We use the same planes and tactics today that we did twenty years ago. By expanding our air-bases and training new recruits we could change this."

SOV_Airspace_Defence: "Airspace Defence"
SOV_Airspace_Defence_desc: "Nothing is more important than the defence of the airspace, as our enemies will try to utilise aircraft in every possible way to conquer our airspace and terrorise the land troops, something we will have to avoid at all costs if we want to be victorious in future encounters."

SOV_The_ORT_System: "The ORT System"

Now, at the head of the state and the party, Molotov is ready to continue the cause of Lenin and Zinoviev."

SOV_Chairman_Yagoda: "Chairman Yagoda"
SOV_Chairman_Yagoda_desc: "Genrikh Yagoda managed to build his career as a Cheka security officer abroad under the guidance of Georgy Blagonravov.

SOV_Decentralize_The_Supreme_Soviet_desc: "The All-Russian Congress of Soviets, or the Supreme Soviet is the supreme institution of the power in the Russian Socialist Republic. Though still the Soviet's legitimacy is questioned by other political parties as it is currently represented by a single party of RKP, we can attempt to legitimize it by allowing candidates from different socialist parties to attend the Soviet and be elected."

SOV_Diminish_The_Cheka_desc: "Formed soon after the Revolution, the All-Russian Extraordinary Commission, or the Cheka is a special punitive agency to fight counter-revolutionary forces. While we slowly transformed into a stable state, there is no more need in the Cheka. If someone will try to seize the power in their hands and use the Cheka against the ones who oppose him, we will all be under threat. The Cheka should be transformed into a subdivision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and only act against terrorism."

SOV_Old_Friends_New_Enemies_desc: "Bukharin, the Left SRs and Mensheviks, are vied by many as traitors. The idea of Kamenev, to organise a homogeneous socialist government, consisting of all socialist parties, is as stupid, as it was in 1917.

SOV_Ally_Bukharin_desc: "Bukharin is viewed by many, including Kamenev, as a traitor. Together with Rykov, he stayed in Russia and formed his own political party, which allowed the market and private property. Even though he claims that such measures are provisional, we cannot trust a man, who says that he's a socialist and then says that the private property is allowed.

russoc.3.t: "Question of the Bolsheviks"
russoc.3.d: "The RKP is the party of Bolsheviks that captured the power in the country in October 1917. Their unwillingness to cooperate with our socialist parties and trust in revolutionary terror has detonated the Civil War. After the Civil War, the Bolsheviks were almost dissolved. Some left for France, the others, like Nikolay Bukharin and Aleksey Rykov founded their own party. Since then the party was ruled by Grigory Zinoviev, a talented orator, but a radical, who believes that only by dictatorship true socialism can be achieved. While his methods seem too radical for us now, we can agree on their participation in the congress only if Lev Kamenev, a more moderate candidate will become their representative and leader, if they succeed.\n\nThe decisions to invite the RKP was greatly criticized by Left SR delegates, who are natural enemies of the Bolsheviks since the July Uprising in 1918."

Most members of the Congress remember that they were the ones who cooperated with capitalist parties during the Civil War. On the other hand, they are eager to support government and their willingness to support workers can be appreciated."

Depending on their results, the Supreme Soviet will be elected and a new Soviet government will be formed.\n\nIn the Soviet system, workers elect their representatives to local councils, then local councils elect regional representatives, and the Supreme Council will be formed from regional representatives. Nevertheless, we will need to choose propaganda socialist posters if we want any party to have greater success in the Soviets. However, in any case, the Government will have representatives of all socialist parties in its ranks."

russoc.7.c: "The question of the minorities should be postponed till further notice."

russoc.8.t: "Trade Unions"
russoc.8.d: "The discussion about trade unions seems to be one of the most hot debate of the Congress. All major factions have their own opinion on the topic. The Bolsheviks, Mensheviks and NSP support the idea of state controlled trade unions, making them powerless. The Left SRs and Profsoyuzovtsy believe that trade unions should be autonomous units of the workers' self-governance, who shall decide the economic programme. The PSR believes that trade unions should be independent and supported by the state."

With the new order consolidated in the country, the [ROOT.GetLeader] has made bail to prohibit all non-socialist newspapers in the country, shutting down the 'Popular Messenger' of the SR party and the 'Socialist Messenger' of the Mensheviks, the most distributed newspapers in former Russian Republic. With the prohibition confirmed, communist newspapers with 'Pravda' as the main source of the news became the only allowed and available in the country.

### New events ###

russoc.23.t: "Question of Kulaks"
russoc.23.d: "Kulaks, or well-to-do peasants, are a petty-bourgeois class from a certain point of view, who were able to enrich themselves through the use of wage labor and engaged in rural usury. On the one hand, reliance on the petty-bourgeois peasants in our agrarian policy contributes to the entrenchment of capitalist relations in the countryside, and from the point of view of the Socialist-Revolutionary doctrine, this is an inevitable sabotage against the Soviet government. On the other hand, we can allow the Kulaks to coexist with the Soviet government, hoping for the enrichment of the village and cooperation."
russoc.23.a: "Seize the Kulak land  in favor of cooperatives!"
russoc.23.b: "Let them be... for now."

russoc.24.t: "Ethnic Soviets?"
russoc.24.d: "One of the main questions about the nature of the Soviet system is the representation of minorities. The Left SRs have suggested to create Ethnic Soviets in order to represent various ethnicities in the lands of the former Russian Empire. However, critics say that this is against internationalist doctrine and can bolster nationalism in the country."
russoc.24.a: "This will definitely help."
russoc.24.b: "This will only stimulate nationalism!"

russoc.25.t: "Formation of Profintern"
russoc.25.d: "Solomon Lozovsky has delivered a speech, offering the government to establish the Profintern - the Internationale of Trade Unions that will help the workers globally. Even though in many syndicalist countries the Trade Unions congresses are controlling the government, there are still many democracies where trade unions are still allowed and workers need more social security."
russoc.25.a: "Send the invitations."

russoc.26.t: "Invitation to Profintern"
russoc.26.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government has offered us to assist our trade unions and join the Profintern organisation. The 'Internationale of Trade Unions' aims to create an organisation of trade unions in order to achieve security of workers rights globally. They also stated that their task is not the destruction, but the conquest of the trade unions, that is, the multimillion mass that is in the old trade unions."
russoc.26.a: "That sounds shady..."
russoc.26.b: "We see benefits in this organisation. Let us join."

russoc.27.t: "[FROM.GetName] Refused to Join Profintern"
russoc.27.d: "The [FROM.GetAdjective] government refused to join the Profintern."

russoc.29.a: "Sad!"

russoc.30.t: "New Female Image"
russoc.30.d: "The new Soviet culture equally rejects both the bourgeois consumer approach to life and the commercial attitude to the dominance of sexuality in female beauty, offering its own solution to the issue: a new type of femininity, based on naturalness, health, hygiene and a complete rejection of the use of decorative cosmetics. An exemplary Soviet beauty should adhere to the following fundamental principles of femininity: neatness / neatness, cleanliness, professionalism, modesty and only in special cases — elegance. \n\nIn addition, the point of view began to dominate that a woman is not only equal in rights to men, but should also be a mother-worker. The image of a working-mother (Rabotnitsa-Mat'), universally propagandizing work and family values, became the basis of our new Soviet culture. The new female image should become an example for the whole world."
russoc.30.a: "All the women of the world are following you to fight against capital!"

russoc.31.t: "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution"
russoc.31.d: "Maria Spiridonova is not just a revolutionary terrorist, but now the leader of a capital-free Russia, so the image of the "Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution" immediately began to take shape around her. Participation in the first Russian revolution and the subsequent ones largely secured this complimentary nickname for her. Moreover, Maria Spiridonova became the first woman at the head of Russia, which in many ways spurred feminists, suffragettes and women all over the world. Ready to lead Revolutions forward and liberate all women of the world, Maria Spiridonova became the new idol of socialism all over the world. \n\nA cult of personality also began to form spontaneously around her, which, however, manifests itself in the universal imitation of the image of Spiridonova, as well as the mass movement of women in Councils at all levels."
russoc.31.a: "Long live Russian Revolution!"

russoc.35.t: "Suspicious Nomination"
russoc.35.d: "Today was the most ordinary day in Soviet Russia. Peasants and workers were working, and almost no one noticed how something terrible happened in the country. Few people have heard that by yesterday's decree, the Soviet government intended to disband the counterintelligence bodies, the Cheka, and give more power to the police, since it no longer saw the need for the existence of this organization for revolutionary terror. \n\nHowever, this did not happen. Instead, today the new deputy head of the country is Yakov Fishman, the head of the Cheka, who clearly claims to be the subsequent nomination for the post of head of the Soviet republic."
russoc.35.a: "That's really strange!"
russoc.35.b: "Sounds like a coup, better remove him from any power!"

russoc.36.t: "Decree on Abolising the Parties"
russoc.36.d: "With the filing of Yakov Fishman, today the government adopted a decree on the abolition of political parties for their uselessness and the transfer of full power to the Soviets. The decree caused a wide resonance among the political elite, as well as the public, although, in fact, it does not imply a rejection of the ideology of parties or their ideas, but only makes all Councils non-partisan authorities."
russoc.36.a: "Do the government has authority to do so?"

russoc.37.t: "Legalist Coup"
russoc.37.d: "After the creation of a virtually shadow government, the abolition of parties and the implementation of terror on an even larger scale, a group of left-wing Socialist-Revolutionary politicians and revolutionaries led by Vladimir Trutovsky.\n\nThey declared the presence of the Chekists in power illegal and unjustified and demanded immediate resignation from leadership positions as well as the abolition of the Cheka. \n\nFurther events developed quite quickly, however, it all ended with the fact that..."
russoc.37.a: "...Legalists were arrested."
russoc.37.b: "...Chekists were arrested."

russoc.38.t: "Electing the Chairman"
russoc.38.d: "The provisional soviet government is about to be dissolved with the new chairman finally appointed by the Legalists. Now, without Terrorism and Repression, a new soviet government will prosper!"
russoc.38.a: "Vladimir Trutovsky will stay as Chairman!"

russoc.42.d.nep: "As the New Economic Policy of Bukharin stated, the private property was never fully abolished, allowing citizens, especially peasants, to own land and make business. However, this is contrary to our new centralist doctrine, as Rykov believes that all property should be nationalized as soon as possible. Though that does not mean we fully abandon NEP, we can give the land to peasants, though without their right to own it. They still can do some profit, but this time the land and everything else shall be nationalized."
russoc.42.d.no_nep: "During the times of NEP, the private property was never fully abolished, allowing citizens, especially peasants, to own land and make business. However, this is contrary to our socialist doctrine, as Rykov believes that all property should be nationalized. While the first nationalization policies are already ongoing, there is still much to do and we should nationalize all the private property in our country as soon as possible." 
russoc.42.a: "Complete nationalization!"

russoc.43.t: "Dissolution of the Union!"
russoc.43.d: "Today, our premier, Aleksey Kuznetsov has announced the dissolution of the union in its current form and instead establishing Autonomous Republics as part of Russian SR. This event has outraged many nationalities, that live in our big countries who see Kuznetsov's decision as traitorous to their autonomy and nation. The riots are being suppressed all across the country, especially in Turkestan, Caucasus and Westernmost regions. However, the riots can escalate..."

russoc.44.d: "As a response to the dissolution of the union, the Ukrainian Left SRs, led by Aleksandr Shumskiy, have declared Ukrainian independence. The rebels have gathered people and volunteers in the Western part of Ukraine. While they have a right to do so, according to the Unionist constitution, it is no more accepted, as the Union has been dissolved. We must immediately respond to their unauthorized seizure of power!"

russoc.46.d: "As a response to the dissolution of the union, the Mujahideen have once again started to raid workers and dekhans of the Turkestan deserts! Moreover, they proclaimed the restoration of the new Islamic Caliphate! We must do something to crush their pathetic movement!"
russoc.46.a: "We shall crush them!"

russoc.49.d: "The Old Soviets are now destroyed, with the new system of Trade Union Congresses now implemented instead. The Central Congress of Trade Unions, the VTsSPS, now holds the supreme power in the country, with the just elected chairman Kuznetsov as head of the Congress and our Republic."
russoc.49.a: "Long live Kuznetsov!"

russoc.85.t: "Yegorov Steps Down..."
russoc.85.d: "As soon as Soviet power was restored in most Russian lands, Alexander Yegorov announced his resignation and the formation of a new military government. The resignation, however, has triggered a fierce power struggle among the nation's top military figures. Many eyes turn toward the formidable General Zhukov, a rising star in the Red Army, as a potential successor. Supporters of Zhukov see him as a beacon of hope and a symbol of the future's promise.\n\nHowever, the echoes of the First Civil War resound in the halls of power, with seasoned veterans of that era stepping forward to stake their claims. Both Mikhail Tukhachevskiy and Mikhail Frunze, despite their twenty-year exile, have cast long shadows within the General Staff. Their experiences and historical significance have garnered them respect and support from various quarters. The three factions — those aligned with Zhukov, Tukhachevskiy, and Frunze — have embarked on an intense political maneuvering that threatens to plunge the [ROOT.GetName] into a new era of turmoil. Reports from Moscow and beyond remain unconfirmed, but a shadowy faction within the Soviet Army has made a brazen move. Their audacious attempt to topple the current government reveals their aspiration to seize the reins of power and assert their vision for the nation's future."
russoc.85.a: "...Zhukov has secured power as the military dictator of Russia."

russoc.100.a: "Of course! They are the original home of true Marxist revolution. We accept them with open arms."

russoc.101.t: "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
russoc.101.d: "The [From.GetAdjective] government has refused our request to join their alliance. Perhaps we are not syndicalist enough for their measure, or unworthy as an ally. Either way, the answer was clearly no."
russoc.101.a: "A poor decision on their part."

russoc.102.t: "Conflict in the Party"
russoc.102.d: "The party has come to be divided between three factions, one led by Bukharin, one by Kollontay and one by Radek. The one by Bukharin champions a path of socialism at a snail's pace, where cautious industrialisation prevents the creation of a massive state bureaucracy as well as wanting to preserve the smychka at all costs and wanting to bridge the general urban-rural divide in the country.\n\nThe faction lead by Kollontay promotes the unions managing the economy, seeing them as the best way to give workers a voice in the economy and the nation. They also are very opposed to the perceived influence of the peasants and thus want to break-up the smychka strongly, supporting the further workerisation of the party.\n\nLast but not least, the faction lead by Radek supports the idea of primitive socialist accumulation, that is to extract the peasant surplus value and to use this to develop the productive forces to transition to make Russia ready for socialism, which is best developed in their mind through five-year plan."
russoc.102.a: "Bukharin's faction wins the day."

russoc.103.t: "The Eastern Threat"
russoc.103.d: "Despite their best efforts and our generous support, the republican government of Russia has collapsed in the face of the socialist forces' onslaught. This is nothing less than an utter catastrophe - the newly-empowered Russian socialists are all but certain to align with [FRA.GetNameDef] and the Third Internationale, reviving the dreaded spectre of another two-front war. However, Russia will need time to stabilize the country, a time we must use to extend our protection to any countries endangered by the new regime.\n\nPoland, Finland and the Caucasus all stand unprotected - we must do whatever we can to protect them, lest they fall to the incoming Russians."
russoc.103.a: "Offer protection to all threatened nations."
russoc.103.b: "We don't fear the Russians."

russoc.105.t: "N.N. Sukhanov's Memoirs of the Revolution"
russoc.105.d: "For years, the course of events during the October Revolution have been a mystery to the world and the general population. The White forces and the Republic they founded made sure to paint the Bolshevik uprising in a negative light, many of the witnesses of the events died in the Civil War, and those who survived were unable to spread the word. Now that the socialist revolution has won in Russia, however, the seven volume memoirs of Nikolai N. Sukhanov, the most comprehensive account of the Revolution available, has been published in Moscow. Sukhanov, a member of the Petrograd Soviet, composed the memoirs in exile, but was unable to release them until today.\n\nThe Memoirs of the Revolution tell the story of the October Revolution from 1917 to its defeat in 1920, and destroy many of the myths which have been perpetuated about its events. For years, the fate of Leon Trotsky, one of the main leaders of the Bolshevik Party and the chief of the Red Army, was a mystery, as unlike the other revolutionaries such as Lenin, his death was never fully confirmed. Sukhanov asserts that Trotsky is dead, however - he perished in an artillery barrage at the last days of the Civil War. His account of Trotsky is a lot more flattering than street knowledge in Moscow, too - White propaganda painted Trotsky as a terrible leader who sacrificed thousands of men in failed offensives, and this perception has since become accepted fact, but Sukhanov describes him as competent and capable, if arrogant and conflicting. The exile states that Trotsky is not to blame for the Bolshevik defeat, foreign intervention and Lenin's death at Fanny Kaplan's hands is.\n\nThe Memoirs have since become commonplace in Russian elementary schools and universities as mandatory learning material for the new generation. They shall learn about the heroism of the original Bolsheviks and their struggle for the rights of the people."
russoc.105.a: "Your sacrifice will not be in vain."

russoc.106.t: "Farmers Begin to Burn Livestock En Masse"
russoc.106.d: "The government's program of mass collectivization, seeing it as necessary to obtain the grain necessary to industrialize in the fashion that the government sees as necessary, has been generally disliked by the peasant masses. Some have even evoked the program of collectivization to the Tsarist time, seeing it as a return of the time as serfdoms, which is rooted in the issue that collective farms (kolkhozs) do not even pay their farmer a formal wage. Instead the farmers are paid in goods like food, water, clothes, et cetera, with the goods the farmers receive being generally less than their grain they deliver to the government is worth.\n\nThus farmers, as an act of retaliation, and wanting to prevent their livestock among others to be collectivized, have begun to eat, kill and dispose of their livestock in massive numbers, they hope thus to prevent the livestock getting into the hands of the kolkhozes. They have also started to destroy things like tools among others as well, as tools will also be collectivised and thus become part of the kolkhozes.\n\nWhile this will certainly not stop the collectivization of the agriculture it has shown that many farmers do not look kindly upon the collectivization and has generally destablized our nation, seeing it as a pure way for farmers to get exploited by the government, who wants to use the cheap grain to further industrialize the nation."
russoc.106.a: "We will have to educate the farmers on the superiority of collectivization"

russoc.107.t: "Search and Requisition"
russoc.107.d: "The spectre of collectivization seems to have also now entered the mind of children throughout the republic, as a [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] form has Cowboys and Indians has become popular, known as 'Search and Requisition.' In this game, there are two teams: kulaks hiding grain and requisitioning brigades intending to requisition the grain. The [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has encouraged this, seeing it as a possibility to increase the influence of Socialists among the children."
russoc.107.a: "We shall turn the youth into good Socialists"

russoc.108.t: "Reds and Whites"
russoc.108.d: "A truly socialist courtyard game has become popular among children, the game in question being called 'Reds and Whites', a truly socialist form of Cowboys and Indians, where the Cowboys are the Reds and the Indians the Whites. The game has become so popular in fact that companies have begun to sell air-guns explicitly for Reds and Whites, with those guns being very popular among children too. The government has strongly supported this, seeing it as a way to mould the youth to be more open to Socialism even in the future."
russoc.108.a: "Children are like soft wax"

russoc.109.t: "Change in Family Rules Result in Spike in Divorce Rates"
russoc.109.d: "While many revolutionaries had a religious background or learned at religious schools, they do not have a good opinion on the Church in general, seeking to break the Orthodox Church and its influence on the Russian society both legally and through their public influence. However, while curbing their cultural influence will take out longer, the government has begun eroding the influence of the Orthodox Church legally.\n\nThe [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government has begun measures to take away the control and forming of marriages away from the Church and making it a civil affair of the government, they also greatly simplified divorce, where it is now a simple matter of registration, instead of the former hard process in Tsarist and Republican Russia.\n\nHowever, while this has greatly improved the mobility of women to leave abusive families, it also resulted in a massive spike of divorce rates on a level never seen before, with the divorce rate being the highest in the world now, thanks to divorce being this easy now."
russoc.109.a: "An unforeseen consequence for sure"

russoc.110.t: "Begin of Latinization of Languages"
russoc.110.d: "As socialism seeks to unite humanity and wither away states in the future, many in the government have proposed that the [SOV.GetAdjectiveCap] government should begin Latinising the languages in its nations, as the Cyrillic alphabet would impend communication between Western Europe and Russia and the people compromising it, among others. However, the full undertaking of Latinisation of all languages in Russia will take a long time, considering the amount of languages there are.\n\nThus the government has begun the Latinisation of the alphabets of the many, many languages which are spoken in the land compromising this nations. The move is spearheaded by the Commissar of Enlightenment, Anatoliy Lunacharskiy, who is known for his more unorthodox opinions, like his opinion that scientific socialism is the deification of humanity, saying that socialists were the most religious groups."
russoc.110.a: "It will be worth all the effort"

russoc.111.t: "Formation of the Young Pioneers"
russoc.111.d: "The Vladimir Lenin All-Union Pioneer Organization has recently been founded, after a long conflict between the Komsomol and the scout movement was decided in the favour of the scout movement, who wanted an independent organization, while Konsomol wanted to keep them integrated into the organization, being helped by the widow of Lenin, Nadezhda Krupskaya, who supported the cause of the scout movement against Komsomol.\n\nThe intent of the young pioneers is to further integrate the youth into the state machinery, swearing an oath to 'to stand firmly for the cause of our Communist Party.' While we are not yet able to integrate a majority of the youth into the pioneer organization, we have already been able to have 1 in 5 children be members of the young pioneers.\n\nThe routine of the young pioneers consist of a lot of marching and singing, gymnastics and sport. Young pioneers also have their own uniform - a white shirt and red scarf -, banners, flags and songs; which has given the young pioneers a great amount of popularity among the youth, as it gives many in the youth, who feel alone and atomised some feeling of belonging in the world."

russoc.113.t: "Defections in the High Command"
russoc.113.d: "It is not just the ordinary soldiers who have chosen to defect to the traitorous uprising. Dominated by the White generals of the Russian Civil War, the Russian Army is not the best place to be for the so-called 'new guard', officers and commanders who enrolled in the Russian army after the Civil War. They were barred from numerous prestigious positions and would often struggle to advance in their career. The decay of order in the country and the growth of socialism left many of them sympathizing with their cause, and now, with the Second Civil War going ahead, they have defected from their ranks and switched their sides to the Bolshevik mobs in Moscow.\n\nImmediately, these traitors have all been tried to death in absentia and will certainly receive due punishment after our victory."

Fortunately, before the Socialists could turn their armies towards us, the diplomatic corps of the German Empire have reached out to us with a message - offering protection from the eastern threat.

The Soviet people will remember Bukharin and his great deeds forever. His duties will be carried out by the Supreme Soviet until the general elections next year. Supreme Soviet has decided to build a Mausoleum in his honour which will be situated in the Red Square, and consist of a big tower, crowned with a sculpture of Bukharin, to glorify their friend and comrade."

russoc.122.t: "Leninist Faction Evolves"
russoc.122.d: "In the aftermath of Bukharin's death, the NSP party has once again been fractioned with several new faces appearing to be the new leaders. One of them is Martemyan Ryutin, who was a Chairman of workers' and soldiers' deputies in Harbin, who failed and was forced to leave for Ikrutsk. After the civil war he became one of the members of the New Bolsheviks Bloc, but was rather irrelevant, until now. Being a member of the Supreme Soviet, he actively promoted the NEP in public speeches, arguing that if Lenin was alive, he would definitely go with NEP. Calling himself a true Leninist, rallying some supporters, he quickly became known as leader of the Leninist Faction, which seeks to continue the NEP policy, though giving more attention to the workers as well as perpetuating Lenin's name in history of Bolshevism and the Soviets."
russoc.122.a: "Interesting."

russoc.123.t: "Bukharinist Faction"
russoc.123.d: "Shortly after Leninist faction evolved, some of the NSP members have nominated Kosygin, a young economist, as a true successor of Bukharin. Kosygin outlined that the NEP system is perfect for Russia and preserving it is a great good for the country. Moreover, he wants to expand the system. While criticized as a revisionist by some party members, his ideas seem rather attractive to the Soviet people."
russoc.123.a: "Another faction evolves!"

russoc.124.t: "National-Syndicalist Faction"
russoc.124.d: "Shortly after Bukharin's death, it became known about the creation of a faction of national syndicalists within the NSP, led by Aleksey Kuznetsov, a young politician who joined the NSP in 1930. Considering themselves opponents of the NEP and ideological successors of the Rykov and Tomsky cause, the national syndicalists seek to combine centralism and syndicalism, and also, most importantly, to disband the Union, which, in their opinion, should not have existed. In addition, they demand to abandon the Soviet system and switch to the Western model of trade unions as real representatives of the working class. Having criticized Ryutin and Kosygin, the national syndicalists accused them of betraying Russia's national interests."
russoc.124.a: "A dangerous movement."

Most of them included the politicans and activists of liberal and bourgeois parties, as well as the Right SR members, like Avksentiev and Chernov. The radical anti-socialists and monarchists, at the same time are still under arrest or imprisoned. The decision was made in order to show that the new revolutionary government won't oppress its opponents by taking away their freedom. Despite that the parties are still banned, the Right SR members were allowed to re-join the new PSR party and take part in politics for the good of peasants and workers."

russoc.128.d: "Comrades, in the report of the Central Committee of the Party, and in a number of speeches held by delegates to the Congress, quite a lot has been said about the Cult of Capital and about its harmful consequences. Comrade Andrei Zhdanov has reminded us how severely the classics of Marxism-Leninism denounced every manifestation of this Cult of Capital, and with the genius of the Revolution that is Comrade Zhdanov at our helm, we shall make it our mission to eradicate this caustic and decaying force. \n\nCiting that Comrade Nikolai Bukharin and his crypto-capitalist allies as the main source of this corrosive cult, Comrade Zhdanov has declared these sycophants to the damaging New Economic Policy to be traitors to the Revolution, with their revisionist acts being tantamount to national betrayal. Their influence must be thoroughly eradicated so that the wider Union can be secured, and Comrade Zhdanov knows just the way to do so without crippling the State. Through mass centralization, close adherence to Party doctrine and proven ideology and theory as dictated by Comrades Lenin, Rykov, and himself, and through the complete dismantling of the NEP along with the expulsion of its proprietors and supporters, the Nation, the State, the Party, and the People shall all know security and prosperity under a truly red dawn. We are absolutely certain that our Party, armed with the historical resolutions of Comrade Zhdanov, will lead the Soviet people along the Leninist path to new successes and to new victories!"

russoc.129.t: "The Downfall of Comrade Malenkov"
russoc.129.d: "As Chairman Zhdanov progresses the Party and the State towards our new future tied inexorably to total ideological devotion, anti-technocratic and anti-moderate tensions have exploded in recent months as Zhdanov’s own views against these groups leak into wider public consciousness. Major cities such as Tstentrograd face large riots and protests against these so-called crypto-capitalist traitors, and what was once to be handled internally has now devolved into a very public scene. \n\nSeeking to quell the unrest and boost his popularity and support while simultaneously eliminating his largest source of detractors and potential obstacles to his plans of centralization, Chairman Zhdanov has publicly proclaimed all enemies to his faction to be traitors to the State. These detractors, centered around Zhdanov’s most fervent rival Comrade Georgy Malenkov, as well as the Techno-Pragmatist whelps, are to be expelled from all government positions or any other seat of power and influenced, reduced to common citizens and forced into secluded early ‘retirements.’ In one fell swoop, Zhdanov has easily been able to legally eliminate most of his political rivals, all with the support of the people, allowing him free reign to reform the State as he saw fit. However, the chaos would not stop for all, for fate had more in store for poor Comrade Malenkov. \n\nExpelled from all public posts and forced into obscurity, Georgy Malenkov had fallen from grace. Once one of the most senior party officials, Malenkov was now reduced to practical imprisonment to a State-provided dacha just a few miles outside his hometown of Orenburg, and it is here - so close to the place of his birth - where Malenkov would meet his final and pitiable end. Eating his buckwheat porridge, blinis, and syrniki with warm Russian tea in the morning air, a single shot rang out from the treeline just a few yards from his patio. Without a whimper or fuss, without commotion, drama, or gravitas, Malenkov slumped back in his lounge chair, lifeless as he bled rapidly from a rifle wound to the neck. Newspapers would pick up the story shortly, with rumors circulating that some lone radical or perhaps a Cheka agent carried out the hit. However, an investigation would never be held, for the State and its new direction did not care - or perhaps already knew. Malenkov represented a pragmatic and compromising past that has no place in our new Union, and for that, he shall be forgotten to history as we march forth into our Soviet future."

russoc.130.t: "Relentless Drive Towards Sovietification"
russoc.130.d: "With the policy of Sovietification among ethnic Russians themselves well under way, the time soon came for various minorities scattered around the nation to partake in this new cultural revolution as well. Their choice was simple: either renounce the imperialist errors that cling to the backwards idea of 'ethnicity', or deal with the consequences of being stuck in the tsarist past. \n\nWhile most realized the foolishness of their old ways and joined the greatest collective ever known to man - the Soviet identity - some foolishly refused. Those who refused this new glorious destiny were transported to special Sovietification education centers, located across the farthest reaches of the State. The main critics and detractors of our government say that these centers are nothing more than brutal labor camps meant to break the spirit of innocent people who don't follow the party line, but that is nothing more than venomous slander spat out by nationalist madmen and former russificators themselves, all afraid of Great Russian chauvinism disappearing forever. Regardless, their numbers are small, and our republic only grows more centralized, united, and cohesive with every soul reeducated or inducted into this new society. We alone know the true path forward, and we shall show it to all within the State!"

russoc.131.t: "Alcohol Declared 'Capitalist Debauchery'"
russoc.131.d: "For far too long, alcoholism has been the greatest vice and sin afflicting the Russian, and now the Soviet, people. From the first vodka plants operated by the Tsars to keep us permanently drunk, stupid, and distracted to the rise of mass-scaled production with the advent of modern Capitalism, alcohol has been a plague for centuries. \n\nWith this in mind, Zhdanov himself has put down the bottle as the first step in a plan to totally rid our union of this liquid sin. Alcohol in all forms is to be declared nothing more than ‘Capitalist Debauchery’, fully outlawing alcohol production and consumption while also making it illegal to keep any alcohol in the home or on your person without permission. The only allowed alcohols shall be certain wines and spirits for culinary and other cultural uses, and will be heavily controlled by the State to ensure there is no abuse of this new law. Additionally, new water bottling plants shall replace the old vodka factories in order to provide the Soviet people with good, wholesome drink that is not a detriment to their physical and mental health, with distribution centers rising in every major city. \n\nThis has led to some pushback, but also a resurgence in other cultural drinks of our people, such as Russian Tea which has exploded in popularity once again as people jump from alcohol to caffeine to curb their addictions. With samovars being a common sight in Soviet households around the nation, Zhdanov is sure that this alcohol-ban is here to stay."
russoc.131.a: "No longer shall our nation be a land of drunks and wastrels."

russoc.132.t: "Cementing the Cult of Rykov?"
russoc.132.d: "A devoted follower of the late Rykov and his principles, Premier Zhdanov has long felt it fitting to honor his former mentor and friend. Before him lies two plans for how to honor the great Rykov. \n\nThe first plan is opulent and grandiose, but still far from gaudy, and revolves around the expansion of Rykov’s cult of personality, with new statues, shrines, and other small offerings and homages to the great Rykov being built all across the State. From the smallest towns to the largest metropolises, everywhere you go, Rykov’s face shall be there, shining his wisdom down onto any onlooker. Though this plan is expansive, it pales in comparison to the alternative. \n\nThe second plan is to not only build these statues and shrines across our Union, but to also build a monumentally-large mausoleum in the heart of the capital in order to permanently house Rykov and other Heroes of the Union once they finally pass. This mausoleum would be one of the largest buildings in the Union, scraping the heavens with its marble spinnerets while decorated in the most extravagant decorations our State can muster, with the beloved Rykov entombed inside a glass sarcophagus for all Soviet citizens to witness. Though some see this as idolatry and borderline dogma, with many critics stating it would overshadow Lenin’s legacy and be a huge waste of resources while also inching far too close to religion or spirituality, Premier Zhdanov has assured these warry minds that this is what Rykov and Lenin would have truly wanted. The final choice however, lies solely on Zhdanov’s shoulders, so how should we honor the great Rykov?"
russoc.132.a: "Rykov shall not know true rest until his mausoleum touches the heavens!"
russoc.132.b: "New statues and shrines shall be enough to honor the great Rykov."

russoc.133.t: "The Forgotten Commission"
russoc.133.d: "During our reorganization efforts as we work to centralize the state and prepare Moscow for new development, it was discovered that there was a committee from the original revolution that has been entirely forgotten about - the Commission on Road Paving. A bit of a strange group, it has been deduced that this group once sought to not only modernize the infrastructure network of old Russia, but to also work towards the total urbanization of our capital region as a whole. Their highly ambitious plan would take decades at the least and would cost untold billions, but the prospect of controlling the largest, most advanced, most well-planned city in history is almost too good an opportunity to pass up. \n\nWe can either resign this forgotten commission to the pages of history, condemning them to be forgotten fully as the madmen they were, or we can humor this old plan, establishing the Central Commission of Urban Development and tasking them to slowly transform Tstentrograd into the largest urban center ever known or even attempted. If they are successful, Tstentrograd will one day come to span across every square mile of our great State, but until then, this will largely be a job-creating money sink. What shall be our final decision?"
russoc.133.a: "They are nothing but fools and madmen, disband the Commission at once!"
russoc.133.b: "Perhaps they are onto something. Our metropolis shall span from coast to coast, pole to pole!"

russoc.134.t: "Mariupol, the City of Music"
russoc.134.d: "Premier Zhdanov has always been a patron of the fine arts. From childhood as a boy in Mariupol, Zhdanov loved to play piano, compose music, and listen to the classics on the radio or on old wax pressings. Now, with Zhdanov rising from that mere boy to become the leader of our glorious new Union, this love of music has not left our Premier, and with his newfound power and with his home city of Mariupol now finally back within Soviet hands, perhaps something can be done to pay homage to this legacy. \n\nA plan has been drafted to construct a massive and ornate concert hall in the city, built in the newly popularized Soviet Realism style, so that Mariupol may truly become the Soviet capital of music and composition. Furthermore, the concert hall shall serve as a gathering space and workshop for our Union’s most popular and beloved musicians and composers so that these fine artists may have a place to work on their masterpieces in peace in the company of other geniuses of their ilk. The plan has been supported heavily by Zhadanov himself, but many of his most dedicated supporters wish to take it a step further, renaming Maripol to be named after Zhdanov himself as a final and ultimate homage to our beloved Premier. Though a name change is not necessary to the completion of the concert hall, perhaps it would be good to cement Zhdanov’s lasting legacy."
russoc.134.a: "Mariupol shall become the heartland of new Soviet music!"

russoc.135.t: "A New Soviet Language?"
russoc.135.d: "Under the rule of Rykov, the Russian language was encouraged to be used, but was not mandatory in any sense, for his Union was open to all children of the lands of Rus regardless of their actual ethnicity, as long as they were devoted to the Soviet cause. This plan, while flexible and successful so far, leaves much to be desired in the mind of Zhdanov, who seeks to fully eradicate the modern Russian language in favor of a new shared Soviet tongue. Zhdanov and his allies have two main ideas on how this new Soviet Language could be formed. \n\nThe first plan, far less far-reaching of the two, is to transliterate Russian into the Latin alphabet before making it mandatory for all Soviet citizens to use as the one accepted language. Despite the relative ease of this plan compared to Zhdanov’s other idea, it would likely greatly anger any non-Russian speaker in the nation. Alternatively, Zhdanov’s more wide-sweeping plan is to combine the many languages of old Russia into one cohesive language based around a Russian foundation, then transliterating it to the Latin alphabet before making it the one accepted language for all Soviet citizens. Though this plan would require far more effort, it would also include aspects of all Soviet groups, creating a truly comprehensive and inclusive Soviet language for all in the State to use without playing favorites with any one group. However, both of these ideas require great effort and fly in the face of the late Rykov’s dream, so the debate around this move has been fierce to say the least. In the end, it is up to Premier Zhdanov to decide the fate of Soviet language."
russoc.135.a: "Create a new Soviet language combining Latin script with Russian and other pre-Soviet tongues."
russoc.135.b: "Simply convert Russian to the Latin alphabet and make it mandatory for all Soviet citizens."
russoc.135.c: "Keep true to Rykov’s voluntary language program."

russoc.500.d.integration_level_1: "After we voluntarily agreed to join forces in the revolutionary struggle against Russia, it could be considered that confidence in our government was assured. Nevertheless, at the recent convention [FROM.GetLeader] insisted that further supervision of our internal affairs was necessary for the continued success of the revolution.\n\nFor now, this means only a slight increase in the number of ministers from [FROM.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], but things will subtly but tangibly change as they are adopted. The broad autonomy we've enjoyed so far will begin to wane, and many will start to turn away from [ROOT.GetLeader] and look to [FROM.GetLeader] for leadership. Perhaps it's time to break free and save our independence."
russoc.500.d.integration_level_2: "We have long enjoyed autonomy in [ROOT.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName], away from the prying eyes of the central government. This has improved governance in many ways, yet that seems to be changing.\n\nThe ruling party [FROM.GetRulingParty], operating out of [FROM.GetNameDef], is pushing for greater control over our largely autonomous government. They insist on control over several key internal functions that we thought would be left alone when we originally agreed to join [FROM.GetFactionName]. Of course, refusal will have dire consequences, but we are fast approaching a tipping point where it will be difficult to break free from [FROM.GetRulingParty]'s reign."
russoc.500.d.integration_final: "This was long expected, but there was still some shock in [ROOT.GetLeader]'s entourage when [FROM.GetNameDef] made his move today. At an emergency congress of the Soviets, [FROM.GetLeader] spoke about [ROOT.GetNameDef]'s future and assured that the central government would take the necessary steps to make his rule conform to [FROM.GetRulingParty]'s ideals. Worst of all, the congress decreed the transformation of our own party into a regional branch of [FROM.GetRulingParty].\n\nAt this point, we have no other choice: either we go down in history as good soldiers of the [FROM.GetRulingParty], or [ROOT.GetLeader] will make one last desperate move for independence.

Ministers are now appointed directly by the central government at [Overlord.Capital.GetCapitalVictoryPointName]. Our economy has undergone profound changes as the once useful national monetary system collapsed after the adoption of the Russian currency.

### New flavour events ###
russoc.136.t: "The Shot Heard Across Time"
russoc.136.d: "Isaak Steinberg, a prominent figure within the PLSR and a leader of its Legalist wing, penned a compelling biography delving into the extraordinary life of Maria Spiridonova, the party's charismatic chairwoman. The narrative traces Spiridonova's journey from her tumultuous years as a convict to her pivotal role as the leader of revolutionary Russia. Maria's fearless critiques of authority became apparent during her studies at the Tambov Women's Gymnasium. Despite frequent clashes with teachers and numerous scandals, Spiridonova managed to graduate in 1902. Financial hardships led her to work as a clerk in the provincial noble assembly, where her remarkable oratory skills caught the attention of local Socialist-Revolutionaries. Recognizing her potential as an eloquent leader, she soon joined the party's Combat Squads. Maria's fiery gaze and compelling oratory became her trademark, earning her a reputation in numerous party meetings and protest demonstrations. Her activism resulted in her first arrest in the spring of 1905, an experience that convinced Spiridonova of the need for more radical methods to achieve their goals.\n\nIn 1906, the Socialist-Revolutionary Committee faced the task of eliminating Gavriil Luzhenovsky, an adviser to the Tambov provincial government known for his brutality. Spiridonova volunteered for the task and, after meticulous planning, confronted Luzhenovsky on the streets, firing several shots at him. The aftermath remains shrouded in conflicting accounts, with some suggesting Spiridonova contemplated suicide, while others describe her pacing back and forth, exclaiming, \"I killed him! I killed him!\"\n\nThis pivotal event marked a turning point in Spiridonova's life, leading to over a decade of imprisonment until her amnesty by the Provisional Government in 1917. Subsequently, Maria actively participated in the Bolshevik Putsch, aligning herself with the Bolsheviks. However, her alliance with the Bolsheviks was not without its pitfalls, as both the bureaucratic nature of the party and the right-wing SRs posed challenges. As the second revolution unfolded, Maria Alexandrovna's socialist utopian ideals triumphed, witnessing the collapse of Russian capitalism and the realization of her revolutionary aspirations."

russoc.137.t: "The Women's Department of the PLSR"
russoc.137.d: "Under the Left Socialist Revolutionary rule, a series of laws were enacted to safeguard the rights of women, ushering in a new era of expanded rights within the family. In a progressive move, the government now announces the establishment of the Women's Department of the Party. This crucial initiative will be led by Irina Kakhovskaya, a trusted ally of Maria Spiridonova and a dedicated Social Revolutionary. The Women's Department is entrusted with a multifaceted agenda, including organizing women's rallies, conferences, and delegate meetings. Its scope extends to childcare, support for the homeless, school inspections, and the distribution of food and housing. This comprehensive approach aims to significantly enhance the well-being of Soviet women and children, fostering improvements within Soviet families at large."
russoc.137.a: "Glory to our women!"

russoc.138.t: "Defending Centralism"
russoc.138.d: "As Comrade Rykov spearheads the centralist doctrine, aiming to centralize the country and dissolve the national autonomies within Russia, a wave of false rumors inundates the political landscape. In response, the Bolsheviks in exile, under the leadership of Zinoviev, issued an open proclamation accusing Rykov of betraying internationalist ideals and harboring crypto-Russian chauvinism. They brand him an imitator of Western European national-syndicalists and a xenophobe. However, these accusations are baseless and unfounded, mere echoes from a group of alleged traitors and Western agents who seek to undermine Lenin's accomplishments. Rykov's commitment to centralism stands in stark contrast to the allegations, and his vision aligns with the principles laid down by Lenin."
russoc.138.a: "Nonsense!"

russoc.139.t: "Comrade Zhdanov"
russoc.139.d: "Andrei Zhdanov, a prominent member of the People's Socialist Party and a key figure in its centralist wing, has ascended in his career during Rykov's tenure as Premier of Russia. Zhdanov emerged as a driving force behind the extensive promotion of the Russian language and culture across all regions of the Russian Republic. Advocating for the eventual unity of non-Russian nations with the great Russian nation into a singular Soviet entity, Zhdanov envisions a powerful Soviet nation at the helm of unprecedented victories for Russia. His ambitious proposals set the stage for significant transformations in the nation's cultural and political landscape."

Notably, he vehemently rejects any inclination towards opportunism or collaboration with bourgeois parties, particularly the Kadets or the right Mensheviks. Simultaneously, Volsky does not spare criticism for the Bolsheviks, viewing Lenin's Russia as a state-capitalist formation devoid of authentic socialist principles. The manifesto marks a significant shift in the ideological landscape of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party."

russoc.141.t: "Notes on the Revolution"
russoc.141.d: "\"Notes on the Revolution,\" penned by N.N. Sukhanov, stands as a venerable source offering profound insights into the history of the revolutionary movement in Petrograd during 1917 and the unfolding of the civil war from 1917 to 1920. Beyond its comprehensive coverage of major events, these memoirs delve into lesser-known facets of the behind-the-scenes dynamics of petty-bourgeois parties, delivering witty characterizations of political figures and offering curious observations on the life, morals, and psychology of the era's populace. Sukhanov provides a detailed account of the fate of Bolshevik Party leaders, chronicling the party's fracture following Lenin's demise and its ultimate collapse in 1920. This publication serves as a valuable resource for anyone with an interest in unraveling the complexities of post-revolutionary Russia."

The congress delved into pivotal issues, including the fortification of labor legislation, amplifying the role of trade union organizations in the nation's political landscape, and contemplating the complete separation of trade unions from the party.\n\nKey figures such as Alexander Shlyapnikov and Alexandra Kollontai, alongside other luminaries in the trade union movements, actively participated in the congress.

russoc.143.t: "A Cinematic Odyssey"
russoc.143.d: "Director Friedrich Ermler brings to life the remarkable journey of Premier Sergei Kirov in the film \"Great Civilian.\" The cinematic masterpiece unravels Kirov's arduous life path, tracing his political evolution from the early days with the RSDRP in 1904, active involvement in the October Revolution and Civil War, to his pivotal role in leading the People's Socialist Party after parting ways with the Bolsheviks.\n\nThe film sheds light on Kirov's commitment to political collaboration across party lines, exemplified by his work with the Kadet Party in 1909, contributing to the North Caucasian newspaper \"Terek\" under the alias Sergei Mironov. It further explores Kirov's post-Civil War alliance with the Menshevik Party, reflecting his shift towards a more moderate stance on socialism and democracy. Delving into Kirov's personal qualities, actor Nikolai Bogolyubov captures the essence of the Premier's character. \"Great Civilian\" has garnered widespread acclaim from citizens, earning prestigious state awards for its compelling portrayal of Sergei Kirov's life and political journey."

russoc.144.t: "Further Democratization"
russoc.144.d: "The implementation of Democratic Centralist principles within the People's Socialist Party by Premier Kirov eventually led to the establishment of the so-called 'Democratic Doctrine'. While opponents of the 'People's Premier' have decried it as a meaningless term with no substance, according to them much alike Nikolay Bukharin's eclectic menagerie of the New Economic Policy, the die-hard supporters of Sergei Kirov were quick to accept the truth of the matter. For the Democratic Doctrine is a fresh start for our Socialist Republic, a true beginning of not the dictatorship, but the democracy of the proletariat. With his mesmerizing charisma Premier Kirov managed to unite a wide coalition of Mensheviks, Centre-Left SRs and even a portion of the Left Kadets into one block willing to support the continuing establishment of a truly visionary and democratic system for Russia and beyond. With the unending devotion of his people and the political capital with endless supply, Sergei Kirov can turn the party into whatever he wills, thus making the government embrace a great humanitarian face. May Kirov and his Russia live long and prosper!"

Wearing it everywhere, she became known as Little Red Riding Hood. One day, her mother entrusted her with the task of visiting her grandmother, bearing pies and butter and inquiring about her health. Undaunted by the dense forest that lay ahead, Little Red Riding Hood embarked on her journey. Along the way, she encountered the Wolf, who inquired about her haste. Little Red Riding Hood candidly shared her mission, unaware of the Wolf's sinister intentions. Seizing the opportunity, the Wolf raced to the grandmother's house, devoured her, and assumed her place in bed, lying in wait for Little Red Riding Hood.\n\nWhen the girl arrived and knocked on the door, the Wolf, imitating the grandmother's voice, invited her inside. Unaware of the deception, Little Red Riding Hood noticed the peculiar size of her \"grandmother's\" eyes, hands, ears, and teeth. It was only when the Wolf attacked and swallowed her that she realized the danger. Fortunately, lumberjacks nearby heard the commotion, rushed to the scene, and, with swift action, rescued the grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood by tearing open the Wolf's belly. A tale of peril, rescue, and the triumph of innocence unfolds in this enchanting animated adventure."

russoc.146.t: "\"ABC of Communism\""
russoc.146.d: "\"The ABC of Communism\" (Azbuka Kommunizma) originally penned in 1919 by Nikolai Bukharin and Evgeniy Preobrazhensky, founders of the People's Socialist Party, underwent a significant transformation in its recent republication. Initially conceived as a communist primer for the largely uneducated population, particularly the peasantry, the book served as a guide to elucidate the foundational concepts of communism and Marxism in accessible language. It functioned as a methodological handbook for the burgeoning members of communist and socialist parties.\n\nHowever, in its revised edition, personally curated by Bukharin, the text has undergone substantial changes. Gone are any references to the imperative Red Terror, the singular rule of one party, the era of war communism, and the advocacy for a planned economy enforced by communists. The updated version now explores the potential for a market system within a socialist framework. Notably, it aligns with Bukharin's economic program, the \"New Economic Policy (NEP).\"\n\nWitness the evolution of communist thought in this revised ABC, tailored for a changing era and reflective of a more nuanced approach to socialist ideals."

russoc.147.d: "Vyacheslav Molotov, the chairman of the Russian Communist Party of National Bolsheviks, took the stage in front of the Kremlin, delivering a powerful address to thousands gathered. In his solemn speech, Molotov sought to elucidate the true essence of the Soviet state's new ideology - National Bolshevism.\n\nMolotov declared that National Bolshevism is not a novel phenomenon for their Communist Party but a lineage rooted in the ideology of Vladimir Lenin. According to Molotov, Lenin was the inaugural National Bolshevik who spearheaded a national liberation revolution against British, German, and French exploiters that had subjugated the Russian people for over two centuries. Lenin's triumph over capitalism, marked by the nationalization of bourgeois property, severed ties with an elite that had long forsaken any connection with the Russian people. Delving into history, Molotov asserted that landlords and bourgeois, disdainful of all things Russian, oppressed peasants and workers, viewing them as second-class citizens. The Bolshevik Party's struggle against foreign invaders found support among the Russian people and other ethnicities within Russia. Molotov recounted Lenin's pivotal decree, \"The socialist Fatherland is in danger,\" issued during the 1918 offensive against German imperialist forces. The decree rallied support for the Red Army in the face of imperialist aggression. The subsequent victory of the White Guards, Molotov argued, was only possible with the assistance of German imperialists, exposing them as puppets and traitors to Russia.\n\nThe essence of National Bolshevism, Molotov explained, lies in a fervent hatred for the anti-human trinity system: liberalism, bourgeois democracy, and capitalism. The National Bolshevik, a rebel at heart, sees their mission in the complete obliteration of the old system, paving the way for a proletarian and communist society built on the ideals of social and national justice."

russoc.148.d: "In a clandestine meeting held today in Moscow, Comrade Molotov and Red Army commander Mikhail Frunze convened to discuss critical military and political reforms deemed essential for the Soviet state. During the meeting, Frunze presented Molotov with his comprehensive draft, outlining a strategic overhaul. At the core of Frunze's proposals for political reform is the concept of state centralization, embodied in what he termed the \"autonomization plan.\" This plan advocates for a substantial concentration of power within the autonomous republics and regions of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR). Frunze contends that, in preparation for an impending conflict with Germany and Japan, a robust centralization of the state is paramount.\n\nCentral to Frunze's vision is the delegation of power within the autonomous republics to members of the Communist Party hailing from the respective nationalities of those regions. The rationale behind this approach is to foster effective governance and local representation, ensuring that the diverse ethnicities within the Soviet state are actively involved in decision-making processes. Molotov, in agreement with Frunze's strategic proposals, has already initiated the process of developing a comprehensive state project to translate these ideas into tangible reforms. The forthcoming implementation of these reforms is poised to reshape the political landscape of the Soviet state, laying the groundwork for a more centralized and strategically prepared nation."

russoc.149.t: "The Course for True Socialism"
russoc.149.d: "In a momentous address to the Soviet people, the Chairman of the Communist Party, Comrade Krestinsky, delivered a resounding message that echoed the revolutionary spirit of the Bolsheviks. Declaring the continuation of the ongoing revolution, Krestinsky heralded the expulsion of foreign agents, saboteurs, and disruptors from the Communist Party's ranks. Krestinsky emphasized the commitment to constructing genuine socialism, guided by the foundational principles of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. In his impassioned speech, he underscored the supremacy of Marxism-Leninism as the only true ideology of socialism, destined to permeate Russia and eventually the world. This ideological stance, according to Krestinsky, is the beacon that will lead the proletarian masses to unparalleled and genuine happiness.\n\nExplicitly rejecting competing ideologies, Krestinsky denounced the petty-bourgeois ideas of the Socialist-Revolutionaries and Mensheviks, the revisionism of figures like Bukharin and Western syndicalists, and the bourgeois ideology propagated by Savinkov. The proclamation resounded with the rallying cry, \"Long live the great proletarian Bolshevik party of Lenin-Krestinsky!\" as Krestinsky asserted that only this party could secure unprecedented victories for the people.\n\nThe resolute message concluded with a stark call to arms: \"Death to the revisionists and capitalists!\" Krestinsky's address left an indelible mark, urging the Soviet populace to steadfastly remember the ideological path laid out by the Bolshevik party in pursuit of true socialism."

russoc.151.t: "Iron Felix"
russoc.151.d: "In a solemn commemoration, Chairman Blagonravov paid homage to the indomitable Felix Dzerzhinsky, a stalwart figure within the Communist Party and a relentless force during the Civil War. Recognized as one of Vladimir Lenin's most loyal comrades-in-arms and theoretical students, Dzerzhinsky led the infamous Extraordinary Commission (Cheka), striking terror into the hearts of the bourgeoisie.\n\nDzerzhinsky's unwavering dedication to eliminating counterrevolutionaries and traitors earned him a place as a symbol of Bolshevik resolve. The Cheka, standing alongside the Red Army and the Red Navy, served as a formidable shield protecting Soviet Russia. The tragic passing of \"Iron Felix\" left a void felt deeply by true Bolshevik revolutionaries, none more so than Comrade Blagonravov. To immortalize the memory of Dzerzhinsky, Chairman Blagonravov announced a directive to name villages, towns, and even cities after this great revolutionary. The decision reflects a commitment to preserving and honoring the legacy of Dzerzhinsky as an integral part of the revolutionary narrative. With an unyielding resolve, Comrade Blagonravov pledged to carry on the revolutionary cause initiated by Vladimir Lenin and Felix Dzerzhinsky. The rallying cry echoed: \"Long live Cheka! Long live the revolution!\""

russoc.154.t: "Rethinking Revolution"
russoc.154.d: "Anna Pankratova, a prominent historian and member of the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, spearheaded a comprehensive reform aimed at transforming Russian historical science. The focal point of this initiative is a reevaluation of the roles played by Socialist-Revolutionaries and Narodniks throughout Russian history. The reform, detailed in the journal \"Questions of History,\" posits that the key figures in the Russian Revolution of 1917 include Maria Spiridonova of the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, Vladimir Lenin of the Bolsheviks, and Nikolai Bukharin of the Left Communists. The journal also offers neutral or positive assessments of other historical figures such as Stepan Razin, Kondrati Bulavin, Yemelyan Pugachev, Mikhail Bakunin, Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Vissarion Belinsky, among others. This reevaluation has the potential to revolutionize the landscape of domestic historical science."

russoc.155.d: "In a decisive move, Yakov Fishman has issued orders to initiate the establishment of chemical troops within the armed forces of the labor republic. These specialized troops have been entrusted with critical responsibilities, including the comprehensive treatment of military personnel, disinfection and disinsection of the terrain and roads, and the vigilant control over the safety of personnel, weapons, equipment, and materiel from potential exposure to radioactive substances. Comrade Fishman believes that such chemical troops will prove invaluable to Russia, especially in preparation for the looming war with Germany."

russoc.156.t: "Moscow Anarchist Federation"
russoc.156.d: "In a surprising turn of events, exiled anarchists, led by Vsevolod Volin, have made a triumphant return to their homeland. Volin proudly declared the revival of the Moscow Anarchist Federation, an organization disbanded at the close of the first Russian Civil War, during which anarchist forces faced obliteration by the Whites. Strikingly, this political revival has garnered attention and support from the Soviet authorities, as Volin pledges allegiance to the established socialist government and offers assistance in the ongoing struggle against oppression."

russoc.157.d: "Grigory Petrovich Maximov, a prominent theorist of the anarchist emigration and key figure in \"Anarcho-Syndicalist Propaganda,\" has taken a surprising stance by endorsing the new socialist regime in Russia. As a participant in the Civil War and leader of the Russian Confederation of Syndicalist-Anarchists, Maximov's support carries significant weight within anarchist circles, further solidifying the strength of the established power."

russoc.158.t: "A Voice for National Unity"
russoc.158.d: "Nadezhda Bryullova-Shaskolskaya, a prominent leader within the Volsky's minority faction of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, played a pivotal role in shaping the party's stance on the national question. At the III Congress of the Socialist-Revolutionaries, she passionately advocated for a federal democratic republic with territorial and national autonomy, challenging the identification of the nation with the bourgeois state. Her vision extended beyond regional considerations, aiming to unite all peoples of Russia into a singular, inclusive entity. Bryullova-Shaskolskaya's influence continued at the IV Congress, where she championed the reorganization of the party on a federal basis and the consolidation of national socialist parties. Following the revolution of the center-left Socialist Revolutionaries, she spearheaded an ambitious project to unify all peoples of Russia under the Party of Socialist-Revolutionaries, transcending both Great Russian nationalism and narrow parochialism. Her dedication to national unity and a broad, inclusive approach set her apart as a visionary within the party's ranks." 
russoc.158.a: "Her ideas are promising"

russoc.159.t: "The New Face of Russian Internationalism"
russoc.159.d: "With the failures of Trotsky being painfully apparent to all during the Russian Civil War and the failed revolution, the old face of Communist Internationalism has been forced into a life of exile and disgrace, forever blacklisted from any self-respecting Socialist organization on Earth and formerly forever in hiding and on the run until he met his timely demise while attempting to cross the Bering Sea into Alaska, sinking beneath the frigid waters and icy waves, forever freeing the world from the stench of his failure. However, with his absence, a void was created - a void filled by Osip Aaronovitch Piatnitsky. \n\nBorn under the Tsardom in the Kovno Governorate to Jewish-Lithuanian parents, his original surname was Tarshis before he changed it to the pseudonym Piatnitsky to avoid the Okhrana’s purges, coming from the word Piatnitsa, or ‘Friday’ - his first Socialist revolutionary group made up of local union workers and tailors in his hometown. From these humble origins, ‘The Man Known as Friday’ as he was nicknamed rose to become a true revolutionary, joining Lenin in the Internationalist wing of the RSDRP and rising to the top while running a newspaper in the heart of the Eastern Front during the Great War. \n\nA contemporary of other Internationalists active in Russia such as the great General Tukhachevsky, Piatnitsky has risen to become the political and civilian face of Russian Internationalism, and he has worked hard to clean the image and reputation of his movement and thoughtform from the stain left by the foul failure he replaced. Going so far as to try to entirely erase the term ‘Trotskyism’ from the Russian lexicon as an alternative word for Russian International Communism, this new shining red star instead pushes the term Piatniskyism as a suitable replacement. Though he is without much support aside from his friends under the Red Napoleon in the Red Army, Piatnitsky is still a brilliant theorist and another example of a true Socialist patriot here in Russia."

bolsheviks.1.t: "The Bolsheviks Return" 
bolsheviks.1.d: "This moment happened. A moment that everyone, even the most committed socialists, feared. In Moscow, a plane landed, on board of which was a delegation from the top leadership of the Central Committee of the RKP. Grigory Zinoviev, the leader of the party since Lenin's death, his right-hand man Lev Kamenev, the main ideologists of the Proletkult - Lunacharsky, Bogdanov and Gastev, economists Grigory Sokolnikov and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky, successful organizers and diplomats Georgy Chicherin and Vyacheslav Molotov, the Kaganovich brothers, as well as the most dangerous man, terrifying all capitalists, Georgy Blagonravov.\n\nDespite all the horror that the Bolsheviks brought to Russia, they were not immediately arrested. They were met by a government car and soon they were placed in the Hotel Metropol. What was it all about? Why were these gentlemen not arrested, or at best executed, and their memory wiped from the face of the earth? Until recently, the Bolsheviks were the terror of all of Europe, but a small group of people who no longer had as much influence and were hated by many. They have no chance of seizing power."
bolsheviks.1.a: "It's a miracle if they succeed."

bolsheviks.2.t: "Calm Before the Storm?"
bolsheviks.2.d: "With the young republic being still too unstable, the decision of military leaders to give all the powers for Bolsheviks seems like madness. The Siberian Insurgency has already damaged the stability in the country, but now is situation is getting out of control. Peasants, who still remember the Red Terror, famine and fear, are starting to become nervous. Very-very nervous. We must expect further insurgency in whole our regions and we will have to deal with it as soon as possible.\n\nBecause if we fail, the Russia will even in a greater danger."
bolsheviks.2.a: "Everything's under control..."

bolsheviks.3.t: "Blagonravov's First Move"
bolsheviks.3.d: "Cheka. One word. A great fear for the entire nation.\n\nIn the first months of the Civil War, a special institution was established to fight the 'counter-revolutionaries'. By the end of 1918 it was already the primary organisation, responsible for Red Terror. Thousands of Russians were shot. All of them were against Bolsheviks and Revolution.\n\nWhen in 1920 the Bolsheviks lost the Civil War, the supreme leadership of the Cheka left as well. But they never stopped their activities. During all these 15 years the underground cells were active in Russia, directed by Cheka from abroad. By [GetYear] the leader of the Cheka in Russia is Georgy Blagonravov - a man with no principles, except one - everything for the revolution.\n\nWith the Bolsheviks in power, too weak now, Blagonravov makes his first move - he sent the message to all local councils and his message was published in all newspapers. He stated that the Cheka organisation is now back and hiring volunteers to serve the state. And a warning below. Do not resist the Bolshevik Power. Otherwise, you will be punished."
bolsheviks.3.a: "Red Terror again?"

bolsheviks.4.t: "Peasant Riots"
bolsheviks.4.d: "Though the Bolsheviks has just begun their rule over Russia, the first resistance followed. In the prosperous lands of South Russia the Penza peasants began their rebellion. They demand that the Bolsheviks immediately give up power to the Soviets, consisting of socialists and that their individual power must end now. The local Chekists, Militia and even army has already arrived in the region, but still do nothing, awaiting the orders of Zinoviev."
bolsheviks.4.a: "First move of peasants..." 

bolsheviks.5.t: "The Congress of Soviets"
bolsheviks.5.d: "With the Bolsheviks return, the Congress of Soviets was called to decide on some major issues that Bolshevist leaders often quarell on. The supreme executive power is now in the hands of Sovnarkom - Soviet of People's Commissars. The government consists of the Chairman of the Sovnarkom - Grigory Zinoviev, People's Commissars of Economy, Internal Affairs, Foreign Affairs, Education (Enlightenment) and others. The decisions, made at the Congress will directly affect the Sovnarkom and the policies, that will be implemented."\
bolsheviks.5.a: "The session begins."

bolsheviks.6.t: "Mayakovsky Returns From Italy"
bolsheviks.6.d: "The futurist poet, known throughout Europe, Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky returned from Italy, where he conducted the propaganda policy of the Proletkult. Although he is not a member of the party, he was invited to join the Congress of Soviets, where the supreme leadership of the RKP sits. Joining his colleagues, Lunacharsky and Gastev, Mayakovsky is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland, inspiring the working class of Russia to labor feats, and... submission."
bolsheviks.6.a: "He's back."

bolsheviks.7.t: "The Peasant Riots Expand"
bolsheviks.7.d: "Our first measures were not enough to put down the rebellion, and now the discontent spreads across the regions. While heavily threatening our stability, other revolts will follow if we don't manage to overcome them in time."
bolsheviks.7.a: "The Cheka will deal with it!"

bolsheviks.8.t: "Proletkultisty Faction Emerges"
bolsheviks.8.d: "A faction of Proletcultists - active participants in the Proletkult (Proletarian Culture) program of Lunacharsky have united under his guidance in a small faction in the RKP. Represented by three main leaders, recently repatriated Vladimir Mayakovsky, technocrat and syndicalist Aleksei Gastev and a Proletkult Boss Anatoly Lunacharsky, the faction demands more funds in the Ministry of Education and Enlightenment, as well as beginning of the Second Russian Proletkult as soon as possible. While we cannot stop them, we can support them - and relocate funds to their ministry."
bolsheviks.8.a: "Full support for Proletkult!"
bolsheviks.8.b: "Right now we have more important matters..."

bolsheviks.9.t: "Sokolnikov Against Plan"
bolsheviks.9.d: "A prominent Bolshevik, Grigory Sokolnikov has recently held a speech at the Congress, denouncing the Preobrazhensky's Planned Economy. Claiming that the society and economy are not ready for such undertakings, Sokolnikov argued that a cautious and mild approach is needed. If we fail to appease the peasants, they will crush us in a rebellion. Therefore, Sokolnikov stated that Bukharin's NEP should be implemented, at least in the beginning. By doing so, we can expect less resistance from peasants and appease the socialist opposition."
bolsheviks.9.a: "An interesting proposal."
bolsheviks.9.b: "We won't change our program."

bolsheviks.10.t: "The Riot Spreads"
bolsheviks.10.d: "We were unable to suppress the riot and now it has spread to the region with Russian minority, sparkling national rebellions of Tatars and Bashkirs. This situation is getting much worse every hour, and if the Cheka is too weak to deal with it, what can we expect from other ministers?\n\nPerhaps, it becomes obvious that Sokolnikov's proposal of adopting NEP is not so bad after all."
bolsheviks.10.a: "A disaster!"

bolsheviks.11.t: "Peasant Riots Supressed"
bolsheviks.11.d: "The peasant riots seem to be finally suppressed by the forces of Cheka, once again proving that this is a powerful organisation that can do anything to secure the stability in the country."
bolsheviks.11.a: "Cheka tightens its grip over Russia."

bolsheviks.12.t: "The Riot Radicalizes"
bolsheviks.12.d: "The Cheka has once again failed to restore control in the regions of peasants and nationalities revolts. But now the situation has gone out of the control.\n\nA Triumvirate of three leaders of the Idel-Ural Tatar Nationalist organisations, Musa Dzhalil, Shafi Almas and Akhmet Temir, has declared the independence of Tatarstan and Bashkurdistan from the Bolshevist Russia. The local militia is already armed and ready to fight us on what they call their national territory. We must immediately crush them to avoid further national rebellions, but some of the RKP members suggest that we should not intervene and crush them later, when the country will be stabilized, avoiding possible war with Transamur."
bolsheviks.12.a: "Their state won't live for long."
bolsheviks.12.b: "Fight for independent Idel-Ural!"

bolsheviks.13.t: "The Tatars and Bashkirs Revolt"
bolsheviks.13.d: "The illegitimate government of Bolsheviks have caused the Tatars and Bashirs to rebel. The government, including [ROOT.GetLeader] suggest we should immediately intervene in the war, perhaps at a cost of losing these territories, but right now we have an advantage over forces of Bolsheviks. Perhaps it is our last chance to quickly overthrow them and restore our power over Russia."
bolsheviks.13.a: "We will deal with them later."
bolsheviks.13.c: "Neither we recognize them!"

bolsheviks.14.t: "Sokolnikov and Zinoviev Blamed in Revisionism"
bolsheviks.14.d: "The Congress Members, most prominent of whom are Preobrazhensky, current economy minister, joined by Krestinsky and Molotov have denounced the Zinoviev's support for Sokolnikov and accused both of them of revisionism and 'rightism'. Zinoviev though parried the Congressmens' thrust on him, claiming that his allegiance to Marxism is undoubtful, but this left everyone with a shady feeling though."
bolsheviks.14.a: "NEP? Never heard about it..."

bolsheviks.15.t: "Blagonravov Demands Expansion of Cheka"
bolsheviks.15.d: "Georgy Blagonravov demanded the expansion of funds and subsidies to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and to be more precise, he wants to make the Cheka a larger and stronger institution. While this is an absolute threat to all non-conformists in Russia, it will possible secure our rule."
bolsheviks.15.a: "Subsidize the Cheka!"
bolsheviks.15.b: "No more money to Blagonravov."

bolsheviks.16.t: "More Delegates Announce Support for NEP"
bolsheviks.16.d: "Each day more and more RKP members announce support for NEP as a possible choice at least for the first couple of years of the Bolshevist rule. The undeveloped industry, peasant riots and Russia being still a capitalist country affects the popularity and stability of our regime.\n\nHowever, talking about the Central Committee of the RKP and the SOVNARKOM, the opinions there are greatly polarized. The ones who support NEP are in minority. Among them there are Grigory Sokolnikov and Grigory Chicherin with Kamenev having an opinion of creating a homogeneous socialist government and, therefore, appeasing the other socialist parties, who, in majority, are in favour of NEP. On the other side there are Proletkultists, Molotov, Blagonravov and Kamenev, who are denouncing the revisionists and looking forward implementing the First Five-Year plan. Zinoviev, personally looking towards the Planned Economy, is somewhat mistrusting every faction, which is not a good sign for the Chairman. But eventally, a formal decision should be made."
bolsheviks.16.a: "Announce support for the NEP."
bolsheviks.16.b: "Denounce NEP supporters for Menshevism."

bolsheviks.17.t: "The Question of Land"
bolsheviks.17.d: "Since the first Bolshevist decrees in 1917, the question of land was considered to be solved once and for all. However, with the NEP supporters arising in the party, it is once again debatable. While some believe that in terms of the NEP some private ownership must be saved, the majority of the Sovnarkom believes in immediate land nationalisation and destruction of capitalism in the village as soon as possible."
bolsheviks.17.a: "Some of private property shall be saved... for now."
bolsheviks.17.b: "Immediately nationalize the land!"

bolsheviks.18.t: "The Issue of Third Internationale"
bolsheviks.18.d: "While the Bolsheviks were in exile in France, they supported the syndicalist regimes, though claiming that their program shall stay the same and Trade Unions will be state-controlled, at least in Russia. With Bolsheviks now in power, they must decide if they stay with the Third Internationale in their struggle against capitalism and imperialism, or follow their own way of Bolshevism and found the Fourth Internationale."
bolsheviks.18.a: "We must respect our ties."
bolsheviks.18.b: "Fourth Internationale shall rise!"

bolsheviks.19.t: "Connections With Imperialists"
bolsheviks.19.d: "Some members of the Party suggest that while we are still in vulnerable position, we must cooperate with Imperialists countries and save our trading contracts and contacts. As expected, this view was suggested by Sokolnikov and supported by Chicherin. The other delegates, though, once again denounced this proposal as 'Imperialistic', 'Revisionist' and 'Menshevist'."

Sokolnikov-Chicherin Bloc, already been called 'Rightist Lean' by the other Bolsheviks, is looking forward creating a popular Economy, saving trade contracts with Capitalist countries and appeasing the peoples of Russia.

bolsheviks.21.d: "With the establishement of the Rightist Lean Opposition Bloc, Zinoviev is now for some reason viewed as a solution to this problem. Though the final decision will still be made by the majority of the Congress members, those who will be supported by Zinoviev will be the likely winners.\n\nZinoviev understood that this decision is very serious and the stability of the party, as well as the stability of country in whole now depends on him.\nMoreover, the opposition was unofficially supported by Kamenev, Zinoviev's closest associate and a very influential Bolshevik. Having always been a supporter of homogeneous socialist government, Kamenev has seen the failure of Lenin and the first socialist revolution as a result of the RKP's previous unability to cooperate with other socialists.\n\nNevertheless, Zinoviev's final decision is..."

He denounced all the Central Committee members of the RKP, including Zinoviev and Kamenev and demanded immediate restitution of original RKP program and ban of any opposition inside the party. Moreover, they once again denounced NEP as 'Menshevist revisionism' and Proletkult as 'Bourgeouis Art Circle' and demanded immediate transition to the socialist society and implementation of planned economy.\nWith the establishement of Krestinsky Bloc, the RKP party has finally found itself divided."
bolsheviks.32.a: "The Congress Will Decide."

bolsheviks.33.t: "Question of Army"
bolsheviks.33.d: "The Congress was unable to decide on the future of the Russian Army. While some delegates believe that the Red Guards shall be reorganized into professional Red Army, as it was during the Civil War, some believe that a somewhat chaotic Militia is much more needed, when the population should be mobilized quickly and effectively. Nevertheless, the Congress shall decide."
bolsheviks.33.a: "Stay with the Red Guard."
bolsheviks.33.b: "Second Red Army shall rise."

bolsheviks.34.t: "Opposition in the Party"
bolsheviks.34.d: "With the emergence of the opposition factions in the party, it is up to the Congress to decide whether opposition in the party is a vital part of Soviet democracy, or it damages the stability in the party and, therefore, in the party."
bolsheviks.34.a: "Opposition is important to realize our mistakes."
bolsheviks.34.b: "We shall follow the General Line of the party."

bolsheviks.35.t: "Electing the Chairman"
bolsheviks.35.d.zinovievdead: "With the Congress of Soviets slowly coming to an end and the majority of decisions being made, it is time for the Congress to elect the Chairman of the Sovnarkom and new Chairman of the RKP. With the death of Grigory Zinoviev, his place was vacant. The Delegates are free to elect the candidate they prefer, but it is likely that a person with most influence and authority will be chosen. The elected Chairman is..."
bolsheviks.35.d.zinovievalive: "With the Congress of Soviets slowly coming to an end and the majority of decisions being made, it is time for the Congress to elect the Chairman of the Sovnarkom. Zinoviev, though, will remain the Chairman of the RKP. The Delegates are free to choose the candidate they prefer, but it is likely that a person with most influence and authority will be chosen. The elected Chairman is..."
bolsheviks.35.a: "Vladimir Mayakovsky"
bolsheviks.35.b: "Aleksei Gastev"
bolsheviks.35.c: "Anatoly Lunacharsky"
bolsheviks.35.e: "Grigory Zinoviev"
bolsheviks.35.f: "Lev Kamenev"
bolsheviks.35.g: "Grigory Sokolnikov"
bolsheviks.35.h: "Georgy Chicherin"
bolsheviks.35.i: "Vyacheslav Molotov"
bolsheviks.35.j: "Georgy Blagonravov"
bolsheviks.35.k: "Nikolay Krestinsky"

bolsheviks.36.t: "Additional Funds Available"
bolsheviks.36.d: "With the immediate nationalization of lands and property, our budget have received tons of mln of roubles that are now in property of the state, and therefore, Sovnarkom. We can now decide how we will spend them."
bolsheviks.36.a: "Nationalization has its benefits."

bolsheviks.37.t: "Additional Funds Available"
bolsheviks.37.d: "While we have not still nationalized lands and property, we have received taxes from our citizens in millions of roubles, that we can now spend on something Sovnarkom needs."
bolsheviks.37.a: "Taxation has its benefits."

bolsheviks.38.t: "Fate of the Left SRs"
bolsheviks.38.d: "With all the power in Bolsheviks' hands now, a question arose about the fate of other socialist parties, especially the Left SRs. At first they were our allies during the Civil War, but in 1918 they tried to overthrow us and since then have been our enemies. With our rule still shaky, the Left SRs use any possibility to terrorize the nation and our party. This must be stopped as soon as possible. So, there are several choices and we must make one of them.\nThe first one is to ban the party and arrest the leaders, including Spiridonova and Kamkov. The second choice is to send them in exile to France, where they won't be able to influence us. The third choice is try to appease them by allowing some freedoms to other socialist parties to show that the New Bolsheviks are not that savages from the past."
bolsheviks.38.a: "Ban them and arrest their leaders."
bolsheviks.38.b: "Send them to exile."
bolsheviks.38.c: "Allow them to operate, but watch closely."

bolsheviks.39.t: "Fate of the NSP"
bolsheviks.39.d: "The NSP is commonly viewed by the Bolsheviks as a traitor Bukharin's revisionist pseudo-socialist party, that is nothing more than a parody on the Right SR party. Although some believe that NEP program is good for the start and trust Bukharin's loyalty to socialism, the others believe that he is a traitor of the party and should be dealt with as a traitor."

bolsheviks.40.t: "Fate of RSDRP and PSR"
bolsheviks.40.d: "These two petty bourgeois parties have always been our enemies and we fought against them in the Civil War. Their fate is almost predetermined, but some members of the party appeal reason and believe that we should allow them to live."

bolsheviks.41.t: "Chekists Coup the Sovnarkom"
bolsheviks.41.d: "No sooner had the new chairman of the party taken his post, as the leadership of the Cheka attempted an armed putsch. A successful one. [ROOT.GetLeader] was arrested in his own office and sent under investigation for seizing state power by deceiving and misleading high-ranking party members. Having departed from the orthodox path and program of the Bolshevik Party, [ROOT.GetLeader] threatened the stability of state power and allowed the party to break up into warring factions. For the sake of maintaining stability in the state, the leadership of the Cheka decided to dismiss the revisionist and traitor who tried to take away the future from the workers' and peasants' society."
bolsheviks.41.a: "An Age of Darkness begins..."

bolsheviks.42.t: "Idel-Ural State Proclaimed"
bolsheviks.42.d: "Some days ago the so-called 'Idel-Ural' government has declared their independence from us! Led by a joint government of Tatars and Bashkirs and their representative, a Tatar Nationalist Shafi Almas, they try to use our instability to finally become independent from the 'Russian colonizers'. They are unable to understand that the Soviet government will liberate them from capitalism and bourgeois-nationalism that have for centuries enslaved common Tatars and Bashkirs. But that was their choice and we should decide what to do with them."
bolsheviks.42.a: "Let them have independence... for now..."
bolsheviks.42.b: "Crush them."

bolsheviks.43.t: "Baltic Fleet Insurgency"
bolsheviks.43.d: "Due to our government's inability to suppress the peasant revolts, the Tsentrobalt (Central Committee of the Baltic Fleet) under the leadership of Pavel Dybenko has sent an ultimatum to us - if we do not immediately give up power to the Baltic Fleet supreme command, we will face riots all across the country and immediate death to everyone who will be again Tsentrobalt. The revolutionary sailors have already disembarked in Petrograd and seized several important buildings. It seems we have to give up power or face drastic consequences."
bolsheviks.43.a: "Give up power to the Tsentrobalt"
bolsheviks.43.b: "A bunch of sailors won't stop us"

bolsheviks.44.t: "Tsentrobalt Supressed"
bolsheviks.44.d: "The revolutionary sailors were not enough to seize the power in the country. Despite our stability is low, with the help of army we managed to suppress the Baltic Fleet Insurgency.\n\nPavel Dybenko, the main instigator faced the trial and was convicted in treason and shot soon after."
bolsheviks.44.a: "The Soviets hold on"

bolsheviks.45.t: "Tsentrobalt Dictatorship"
bolsheviks.45.d: "The revolutionary sailors quickly seized all important building in Petrograd, and in other major cities and villages they were joined by revolutionary peasants and anarchists who managed to overthrow our rule. With no support, the Sovnarkom had to flee the country, but nobody knows where exactly - perhaps they were relocated in the French Commune. Nevertheless, Pavel Dybenko has proclaimed the supreme rule of Tsentrobalt and now all the power in the country belongs to him."
bolsheviks.45.a: "Long live the Tsentrobalt!"

bolsheviks.46.t: "Chairman Zinoviev's 'Appeal to the Nation'"
bolsheviks.46.d: "Today, the chairman of the party, Zinoviev, for the first time since the Bolsheviks came to power, spoke at a rally of thousands in Moscow, where he addressed the nation.\n\n'Comrades! Workers and peasants! Soldiers and officers! The time of capitalist oppression is over. The imperialists of Germany and America are already preparing to lay down their arms and be defeated, to realize the power and strength of the workers 'and peasants' state. Our allies in France and Britain are ready to assist us in the return of our fraternal peoples to their homeland-Ukrainians, Belarusians, friendly Baltic socialists.\n\nComrades! To achieve this goal, we need to rally around the Bolshevik party, because only the Bolshevik party can lead our country to victory - to the power of the workers and peasants! I appeal to the revisionists and the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik opposition, as well as to the followers of the traitor Bukharin! Lay down your weapons, stop fighting. The Soviet government is already here and it will not leave. The government will be organized through the Soviets, under the supervision of the Council of People's Commissars. The enemies of the people will be brought to justice. Once again, citizens! Express your opinion through the Soviets of workers and peasants, and not through Bukharin-Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik revisionist nonsense! Only through cooperation can our nation find unity!'"
bolsheviks.46.a: "He has a point!"

bolsheviks.47.t: "Centralization of Power"
bolsheviks.47.d: "Despite the assurances that the Bolshevik party is democratic to the core, Grigory Zinoviev declared the centralization of power in the hands of authorized Soviets. He says that this measure is temporary and certainly forced because society is unstable. In the future, when the country is sufficiently developed, the power will be decentralized. This decision, however, was received ambiguously by some of the more right-wing members of the party. They were outraged by Zinoviev's decision to centralize power, as this contradicts Marxism. However, Zinoviev, our leader, was able to quickly convince this bunch of unrighteous Bolsheviks of their wrongness"
bolsheviks.47.a: "Long live the Council of People's Commissars!"

bolsheviks.48.t: "Dissatisfaction With the Collectivization"
bolsheviks.48.d: "To our surprise, many peasants were dissatisfied with the collectivization. They were dissatisfied with the socialization of the land, the good that socialism brought them. They are in revolt, demanding the return of their crops, their livestock, and, worst of all, their property. This month, about 3,000 peasant riots have already been suppressed, and a terrible famine has broken out in some regions. The peasants flee to the cities and become workers, because they think that the life of the worker is much better. They are right only in one thing - it is a state for workers, built by workers. While they are rioting, we have achieved results that Kerensky could only dream of. We must bear this burden of collectivization until the end of time, for all power comes from the people, and we are their representatives."
bolsheviks.48.a: "They will obey."

bolsheviks.49.t: "Vozhd of the Proletariat"
bolsheviks.49.d: "Long live the Communist Party of Lenin-Zinoviev! Long live Zinoviev, the Vozhd of the Proletariat!\n\n\nGrigory Zinoviev is the man who led our Communist Party forward to a bright future for 20 years. Having become a worthy successor to Lenin, Zinoviev rallied the party and never left it. Even in the most difficult and cruel days of the Civil war, when Zinoviev was forced to capitulate and go abroad, all this time in exile he remained loyal to the cause of Lenin and socialism. Let his name forever remain in history, and monuments to Zinoviev will be erected in all Russian cities."
bolsheviks.49.a: "Cause of Lenin lives because of Zinoviev!"

bolsheviks.50.t: "Famine!"
bolsheviks.50.d: "In our country, as reported to the Chairman, entire regions are facing a terrible famine. The main factors contributing to the famine, according to the report, are the forced collectivization of agriculture, forced grain purchases combined with rapid industrialization, a reduction in the agricultural labor force, and several severe droughts. All this, of course, is nonsense, and the main reason is the drought, and perhaps the actions of Western spies and saboteurs. In any case, we will have to deal with the famine and its consequences."
bolsheviks.50.a: "A tragedy!"

bolsheviks.51.t: "The Cause Of Lenin"
bolsheviks.51.d: "The precepts of Ilyich became a popular expression, now used at almost every party congress, as well as in the press, which indicates that our country should live and develop along the path set by its founder, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.\n\nLeninism is our ideology! We will create a state for the workers, as Lenin bequeathed, and we will follow its doctrines: socialist industrialization, the co-operation of the peasantry, and the cultural revolution."
bolsheviks.51.a: "By following his testaments, we will build communism!"

bolsheviks.52.t: "The Ideals of Bolshevism"
bolsheviks.52.d: "What is Bolshevism? Of course, the main theorist of Bolshevism is Vladimir Lenin, but many attribute to Bolshevism the ideology of the traitor Bukharin, as well as other various revisionist movements.\n\nIn fact, the ideology of Bolshevism was carefully developed first by Vladimir Ilyich, and then in exile by Grigory Zinoviev and Yevgeny Preobrazhensky. In practice, Bolshevism is a centralized country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, which exercises its power through a cohesive and disciplined Bolshevik party. These are industrialization, collectivization, and the creation of a society of justice and intolerance towards revisionists and counter-revolutionaries.\n\nHaving built such a country, we will finally rise from the ashes."
bolsheviks.52.a: "Bolshevism is our main doctrine!"

bolsheviks.53.t: "Chairman Kamenev"
bolsheviks.53.d: "Lev Kamenev, along with Grigory Zinoviev, was for a long time one of Lenin's closest associates. He became known as one of the opponents of the armed revolution in October 1917, and many have not forgotten this, both colleagues and enemies. In addition, for a long time he tried to persuade Zinoviev to reconsider his relations with other socialist parties, because after losing the civil war, Zinoviev thought that no party would accept the Bolsheviks in the coalition.\n\nHowever, history had its own plans. And now Kamenev is at the head of the party, and all the main decisions will be up to him."
bolsheviks.53.a: "Long live Chairman Kamenev!"

bolsheviks.54.t: "The Fate of the Supreme Soviet"
bolsheviks.54.d: "Since the Bolsheviks came to power, the supreme power belonged to the Council of People's Commissars - the so-called Upper Council.\n\nKamenev suggests that the best option would be to decentralize the Sovnarkom - that is, to create a coalition government with other parties, including the Social Revolutionaries, Bukharinites and Mensheviks. This met with a sharply negative reaction among the Central Committee, where most of the members are radically opposed to coalitions with other parties.\n\nNevertheless, as long as the Council of People's Commissars is still subordinate not to the majority, but to the chairman, Kamenev has carte blanche to form a homogeneous socialist government."
bolsheviks.54.a: "Let's Choose Our Partners"

bolsheviks.55.t: "Lift the PLSR Ban?"
bolsheviks.55.d: "Earlier, the Council of People's Commissars banned the activities of the left SR party in Russia and arrested its leaders. This approach was wrong, and now in preparation for the creation of a coalition government, perhaps we should reconsider this decision, and release the leaders of the PLSR from arrest and offer them seats in the Council of People's Commissars?"
bolsheviks.55.a: "Lift the ban!"
bolsheviks.55.b: "We remember their betrayal during 1918 Uprising"

bolsheviks.56.t: "Lift the NSP Ban?"
bolsheviks.56.d: "Earlier, the Council of People's Commissars banned the activities of Bukharin's Party of People's Socialists in Russia and arrested its leaders. This approach was wrong, and now in preparation for the creation of a coalition government, perhaps we should reconsider this decision, and release the leaders of the NSP from arrest and offer them seats in the Council of People's Commissars?"
bolsheviks.56.b: "We remember Bukharin's betrayal."

bolsheviks.57.t: "Lift the RSDRP and PSR Ban?"
bolsheviks.57.d: "Earlier, the Council of People's Commissars banned the activities of the Menshevik and Socialist-Revolutionary party in Russia and arrested its leaders. This approach was wrong, and now, in preparation for the creation of a coalition government, perhaps we should reconsider this decision, and release the leaders of the RSDRP and PSR from arrest and offer them seats in the Council of People's Commissars?"
bolsheviks.57.b: "We fought on different sides in the Civil War!"

bolsheviks.58.t: "A New Chairman?"
bolsheviks.58.d: "The most important part of creating a homogeneous socialist government and decentralizing power is to be able to concede. That is why Kamenev suggests that in the new Council of People's Commissars, decisions should be made by a majority vote and not by a single decision of the chairman. He is going to resign from the post of chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, while remaining the nominal head of state and Minister of Foreign Affairs. The chair of the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars will go to one of the leaders of the coalition parties. It remains only to choose who exactly."
bolsheviks.58.a: "Aleksander Shlyapnikov - a trade-unionist from NSP"
bolsheviks.58.b: "Maria Spiridonova - leader of the Left SRs"
bolsheviks.58.c: "Reconcile with Bukharin and unite into single party!"
bolsheviks.58.e: "Viktor Chernov - leader of the PSR"
bolsheviks.58.f: "Rafail Abramovich, head of the Mensheviks-Internationalists!"

bolsheviks.59.t: "Sokolnikov Leaves the Central Committee"
bolsheviks.59.d: "Despite Sokolnikov's support for Bukharin's NEP policy, he was a staunch opponent of Bukharin's treachery. After the appointment of Bukharin to the post of chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, Sokolnikov announced that he was leaving the Central Committee of the RKP and the Bolshevik Party. Sokolnikov will probably leave the country, fearing persecution."
bolsheviks.59.a: "His authoritarian nature showed up."

bolsheviks.60.t: "Zinoviev Leaves the Central Committee"
bolsheviks.60.d: "For almost 20 years, the chairman of the Bolshevik Party, Grigory Zinoviev, was an honest fighter for the rights of workers and an active defender of Leninism and Marxism. However, after the decision to appoint a new chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he perceived it as a betrayal and a personal insult. Zinoviev announced his withdrawal from the Central Committee of the party and the creation of an opposition to the current anti-Bolshevik regime of Kamenev."
bolsheviks.60.a: "He just cannot recognize his mistakes."

bolsheviks.61.t: "Kamenev Curtails Homogeneous Government"
bolsheviks.61.d: "After it became clear that all the parties that could presumably be taken into the coalition remained banned, and their leader was still under arrest, Kamenev had no choice but to resign as chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. This role is claimed by many Bolshevik figures, and it is likely that soon the Central Committee of the RKP will re-elect a new candidate."
bolsheviks.61.a: "Too bad for us."

bolsheviks.62.t: "A New Chairman Re-Elected"
bolsheviks.62.d: "As expected, the Central Committee of the RKP re-elected a new chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, who enjoyed the greatest popularity and respect among the members of the Bolshevik party. We can only hope that the life of the workers and peasants will improve under the new chairman."

bolsheviks.63.t: "Down With the Cheka Influence!"
bolsheviks.63.d: "Since the arrival of the Bolshevik Party to power, the state security body of the Cheka actively began to engage in anti-counter-revolutionary activities. However, the new government believes that the influence of the Cheka is becoming too comprehensive, and the real number of enemies inside the country is not so large. It is necessary to sharply cut the funding of the Cheka and limit their activities before they arrange something bad for us..."
bolsheviks.63.a: "The Cheka Power should be limited!"

bolsheviks.64.t: "A United Party"
bolsheviks.64.d: "After the creation of the coalition government, the Council of People's Commissars came to the conclusion that there was no longer a need for the existence of a structure of various parties with a complex internal mechanism for electing the Central Committee, etc. From now on, there will be a single platform, that is, a united party, in which it will be legally possible to create factions. The Central Committee of the party will be unified and will include representatives from different socialist parties."
bolsheviks.64.a: "This will threaten our socialist democracy!"
bolsheviks.64.b: "Proletarians of all parties, unite!"

bolsheviks.65.t: "Socialist Democracy"
bolsheviks.65.d: "Everything happens as planned by Kamenev. The country has begun to slowly recover from the ruins - the workers receive a decent salary, and the peasants work hard in the Russian fields and do not deny themselves anything.\n\nKamenev always saw socialist Russia as such-without the dictatorship of the proletariat, war, deprivation and hunger. All parties work together for the happiness of the citizens of their state, and do not fight with each other for power.\n\nThis, perhaps, was the ideal to which Lenin aspired, but which he could not realize because of the time when the war of man with man raged everywhere. We will remember Comrade Lenin, because it was he who lit up the way for us-a worthy way, how a person should live. And as long as people still have memories of the great Lenin in their memory, our country will stand firm and inexorably go forward to communism."
bolsheviks.65.a: "Long Live Russian Socialist Republic!"

bolsheviks.66.t: "Choosing Sovnarkom Direction"
bolsheviks.66.d: "Before establishing the work of the Council of People's Commissars, we must choose the direction on which we will focus in the course of development. The program will last for a year. We can allocate funds for the development of foreign relations, so as not to find ourselves in international isolation, for the development of the economy, to recover from Kerensky, for the development of the Cheka, to defeat the enemies of the people and spies, or to stop at education: to get rid of illiteracy and promote Soviet power."
bolsheviks.66.a: "Focus on foreign relations."
bolsheviks.66.b: "Focus on economic development."
bolsheviks.66.c: "Focus on internal security."
bolsheviks.66.e: "Focus on the Enlightenment."

bolsheviks.67.t: "[SOV.GetLeader] Becomes a New Chairman"
bolsheviks.67.d: "As a result of the internal party struggle for power somewhere deep inside the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party, [SOV.GetLeader] was elected the new chairman of the party and the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian Socialist Republic.\n\nRed banners depicting Vladimir Lenin and [SOV.GetLeader] - two leaders of the Russian proletariat are now appearing on the streets of Moscow. Under the new chairman, life in Russia promises to be better, freer and fairer."
bolsheviks.67.a: "We congratulate the new Chairman!"
bolsheviks.67.b: "Another Soviet Dictator..."



### Prolekult Events ###
proletkult.1.t: "Proletkultists Faction Majority"
proletkult.1.d: "With the end of the Congress of Soviets, a member of the Proletkultists factiom, [ROOT.GetLeader] became elected the Chairman of the Sovnarkom. The new People's Commissars were appointed soon and now we can start to implement our important policies in the territories of Russia. With the experience we have, the Cultural Revolution will be achieved in few years. The most important issues shall be soon decided on by the People's Commissariat of Enlightenment."
proletkult.1.a: "Long live the Proletkult!"

proletkult.2.t: "The Issue of Illiteracy"
proletkult.2.d: "The absence of Proletkult in republican Russia has led to the fact that most of the population of our country cannot be called literate. Even so, they are not literate from the point of view of proletarian culture. Various capitalist, bourgeois and philistine views have enslaved the consciousness of these people, which means that measures must be taken to proletarize their culture.\n\nThe new program within the framework of the Proletkult was called "Likbez" or the elimination of illiteracy. Active literacy training will begin, and the literate will be obliged to teach the illiterate through labor service. Illiterate students will be taught: to read clear printed and written fonts; to make brief notes necessary in life and official affairs; to read and write down whole and fractional numbers, percentages, to understand diagrams; the students will be explained the main issues of the construction of the Soviet state."
proletkult.2.a: "To be illiterate equals to be blind!"

proletkult.3.t: "Proletarian Ethics"
proletkult.3.d: "The so-called proletarian ethic is a necessary condition for the development of proletarian culture. Instilling a proletarian ethic will not be easy, but it is important - with the help of a powerful propaganda campaign of our ideas, we will achieve unprecedented success. Our proletkult program will be very powerful, such as the world has never seen before."
proletkult.3.a: "Long live the Cultural Revolution!"

proletkult.4.t: "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.d: "Mayakovsky proposed to introduce his own ideas into the Proletkult - what he calls Social-Futurism. He proposes to create a society of educated and talented people. Everyone should master any art - the one that he or she will like. Training in painting, and especially in modern styles, architecture, and music, will be necessary and mandatory for everyone, both adults and children. The creation of the Soviet intelligentsia is the ultimate goal of the Mayakovsky plan. And he sincerely does not understand and is not going to recognize the right of people to choose if they should do arts or not. 'Art is not a hindrance to work' - as Mayakovsky correctly put it\nThe only question is whether the People's Commissariat of Education will support such an initiative."
proletkult.4.a: "Full support for Social-Futurism"
proletkult.4.b: "That's somewhat... insane."

proletkult.5.t: "Soviet-Syndicalist System"
proletkult.5.d: "Aleksei Gastev, a scientist and proletarian who worked in Europe for many years, argues that the People's Commissariat of Education is obliged to put the issue of trade unions on the agenda. According to Gastev, Russia needs to combine the Soviet and syndicalist system of government. All economic power should belong to trade unions and autonomous collectives (syndicates) of workers, and all political power should belong to Soviets elected at all levels.\n\nGastev's ideas have surprised some people's commissars, but many recognize the success and viability of the syndicalist system of government. Perhaps in symbiosis with the Soviets, the system will work even better."
proletkult.5.a: "Full support for Soviet Syndicalism"
proletkult.5.b: "You can't combine incongruity"

proletkult.6.t: "Proletarian Religion"
proletkult.6.d: "Lunacharsky, being a respected man, suggested that the People's Commissariat of Education return to his early ideas: the creation of a proletarian religion. Of course, many people are skeptical: after all, Marxism is equal to atheism. However, Lunacharsky insists on his own, as the head of the People's Commissariat of Education, he has the right to do so. Unless, of course, the ideas of Mayakovsky or Gastev are more preferred by the People's Commissars."
proletkult.6.a: "Full support for Proletarian religion!"
proletkult.6.b: "The idea is insane, Lunacharsky should forget about it!"

proletkult.7.t: "New Chairman of the Narkompros"
proletkult.7.d: "It is time to choose the new chairman of the Narkompros. The most possible candidate is likely to be the candidate, who has more influence and authority over Sovnarkom, and whose ideas are more liked by the People's Commissars. However, a compromissable variant can be made: fulfill the program of the new chairman, through implementing some ideas of the other candidates."
proletkult.7.a: "Mayakovsky is a preferable choice"
proletkult.7.b: "Gastev is a preferable choice"
proletkult.7.c: "Lunacharsky is a preferable choice"

proletkult.8.t: "Chairman Mayakovsky"
proletkult.8.d: "Mayakovsky has found himself at the very top: he's now the Vozhd of the Proletariat and Chairman of the Sovnarkom. Though he's not a member of the RKP, he decided to change the name of the party and become its new leader. In his first decree, the Communist party was renamed into Proletarian Party of Futurists and its main ideology was stated as Social-Futurism - a minor branch of Marxism. Though some did not like the changes, blaming Mayakovsky in revisionism - they were quickly silented by exclusion from the party. With PPF standing triumphant, Mayakovsky is standing firmly as the Leader of the Avant-Garde."
proletkult.8.a: "It's time to implement our policies!"

proletkult.9.t: "Social-Futurism"
proletkult.9.d: "For many members of the already modified party, it is not entirely clear what social-futurism is. Despite the fact that Mayakovsky made many speeches about the new ideology of the proletarian state, not everyone clearly represents the implementation of his projects in practice.\n\nIn fact, everything is much simpler than it seems. The main idea of social futurism is to create a society of talented and educated people, where everyone has mastered some art and is ready to work for the benefit of the Motherland and world socialism. Perhaps Mayakovsky's ideas are in many ways utopian and unrealizable - but with what optimism the people's poet strives for this goal!"
proletkult.9.a: "Long Live Social-Futurism!"

proletkult.10.t: "Modern Art Exhibitions"
proletkult.10.d: "Wonderful leisure and entertainment in the proletarian republic are available to everyone!\n\n\nBy a new decree of the Chairman of the Federal Chamber of Commerce and Industry Vladimir Mayakovsky, all exhibitions of contemporary art featuring works by world-famous artists will be free for everyone forever.\n\nContemporary art, including its new forms such as suprematism and Cubism, is the voice of the proletarian, a challenge to capitalism and exploitation. Admiring contemporary art is not a right or a desire, it is the duty of every law-abiding citizen who believes in socialism and hates the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe exhibitions will feature works by Kazemir Malevich, one of the leading figures of futurism and chairman of the Art Board of the Art Department of the People's Commissariat of Education, Marc Chagall , one of the leading avant-garde artists, as well as some works by Picasso brought from chaos-ridden Spain."
proletkult.10.a: "Awesome!"

proletkult.11.t: "Free Master Classes"
proletkult.11.d: "Free clubs and master classes will be organized throughout the country, in which young and adult citizens of the proletarian republic will be taught the relationship of chromatic tones, contrasts and nuances of light and dark, black and white gradations, graphic means of line and silhouette, and the texture of the paint layer.\n\nIn addition to painting, young avant-gardists will be given lessons in dance and music, including modern futuristic genres. Music clubs will study the theory of music and sound, harmony, musical notation and musical forms. At the dance lessons, you will be able to learn harmonic movements and poses, plastic and facial expressions, tempo and rhythm, as well as master modern and popular genres.\n\nSpecial attention should be paid to literary circles: in Moscow and Petrograd, master classes will be given by Velimir Khlebnikov, Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Boris Pasternak and Daniil Kharms. There are rumors that even the master of verse, the thunderstorm of all capitalists and the genius of the poetic word, will perform at the literary master class in the capital: Vladimir Mayakovsky himself."
proletkult.11.a: "Proletkult is great!"

proletkult.12.t: "Theater and Cinema"
proletkult.12.d: "in all cities of Russia in the largest theaters will be free performances with the latest productions of Vsevolod Meyrehold, based on the plays of Mayakovsky. In the same cities where there is no theater yet, it was decided to immediately build and open to the public the so-called people's theaters.\n\nCinema is also rapidly developing. Thanks to the achievements of socialism, this year viewers across the country will be able to see Sergei Eisenstein's film "Alexander Nevsky"for free. In it, the Old Russian prince confronts the imperialist invaders of the Teutonic Order, who are referred to in the film as the Germans. Surprisingly, the main antagonist, the leader of the Teutonic Knights, was named Wilhelm. Is this a reference to the German Kaiser, or is it just a satire on inhumane capitalism? In any case, the film tells about the victory of the Russian people-ordinary peasants and workers, led by the Vozhd, who composes his words in beautiful verses."
proletkult.12.a: "Masterpiece!"

proletkult.13.t: "Obligatory Creative Education"
proletkult.13.d: "The resolution of the Council of People's Commissars, signed personally by Vladimir Mayakovsky, reads as follows:\n\nEvery citizen of the Proletarian Republic is obliged from an early age to learn any kind of art: painting, music, dance, acting, or literature. Attendance at children's clubs is mandatory and will be supervised by teachers and school principals. For adults, separate clubs will be organized, which they will be required to attend every week on weekends.\n\nThanks to the organized free exhibitions within the framework of the Proletkult, which contributed to the popularization of art among most of the citizens of the proletarian republic. Even though some of them are dissatisfied with this decision, the Council of People's Commissars knows better, doesn't it?"
proletkult.13.a: "We'll build a nation of the talanted!"

proletkult.14.t: "With Hammer and Sickle"
proletkult.14.d: "The new 'Soviet identity' must be forged with a hammer and sickle. The rich culture and history of all the peoples inhabiting the Proletarian Republic should undoubtedly be perpetuated in memory. But as for the present and the future, the Proletkult takes over.\n\nThe new Soviet identity is not just a brand in the passport of citizenship. This is a new Soviet culture, a new nationality and a new language.\n\nMeasures to internationalize the Russian language and the languages of national minorities, that is, to translate them into the Latin alphabet, are not enough. What is needed is a more radical reform of the language and its slow transformation into a new one: free from the yoke of capitalism, not imposed from outside. The new Proletarian language will be based on the Latin alphabet and use Latin roots to bring our peoples closer to the peoples of the socialist countries of France, Italy and England.\n\nSo far, the measures taken by the government are not enough, but soon, perhaps even in this decade, the schools of the Proletarian Republic will learn the grammar of the PROLYAZ - the Proletarian language."
proletkult.14.a: "New times need new methods."

proletkult.15.t: "Emergence of Soviet Intelligentsia"
proletkult.15.d: "Quite expected was the emergence of the Soviet intelligentsia - the most educated and honored workers of the Proletarian Republic-academicians, professors, scientists, inventors, artists and musicians.\n\nThe so-called party nomenclature was replenished with the ranks of new, successful citizens, ready for work and defense.\nIn other socialist countries, such inequality is unacceptable, but here is the whole point: in our republic, there will be no inequality of the intelligentsia and the common people. In our republic, there will be no ordinary people at all. The ultimate goal of our beautiful socialist society is to build it. Classless, without division into rich and poor, educated and uneducated, talented and untrained. Yes, they say that talent is an exceptional thing. But will you say it to Mayakovsky's face? Of course not."
proletkult.15.a: "Every man an Intelligentsia!"

proletkult.16.t: "Repressions Against Philistines"
proletkult.16.d: "Many did not take seriously the demands of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman Mayakovsky on compulsory creative education. Moreover, even if they did, it wasn't serious. They did not put enough effort into mastering the art. This is what causes the inequality and higher position of the intelligentsia. Do you think they deserve it? Perhaps. But this is unacceptable for a socialist state that bears the proud name of a Proletarian Republic!\n\nFrom now on, and forever, the avoidance of creative activity will be prosecuted with all severity. Citizens who have given up creative activity will work for the benefit of the motherland in labor camps: build new river channels, build hydroelectric power stations, plant forest belts. They will not be useless as before. If they dare to criticize the government's decisions, their fate will be more severe. They will be shot for treason, for their pettiness, commercialism, laziness and lack of talent.\n\nRemember, citizens! The party does not forgive you for your laziness. Labor has made a man out of an ape, and creativity has made a superman out of a man. The party will never forgive you for this."
proletkult.16.a: "If you don't respect our rules - why should we respect yours?"

proletkult.17.t: "Great Construction Projects of Communism"
proletkult.17.d: "Man must be a friend and a brother to nature. But before we can move on to such a relationship, we must tame and conquer nature. Nature will serve us as a good friend if we learn to use its rich land resources, to irrigate it with rivers and lakes, generously provided to us.\n\nThe Great Construction Projects of Communism - that's what the Council of People's Commissars called the projects that we will soon have to make. The main and key ones are undoubtedly the connection of the Baltic and White Sea through the White Sea-Baltic Canal, the connection of Moscow and the Volga through the Mayakovsky Canal, the connection of the Don and Volga through the Volgodonsk Canal, as well as the turn of the Siberian Rivers to irrigate the barren and arid lands of Central Asia. The construction of hydroelectric power stations on many rivers will give us a lot of energy, which we use for the benefit of the people."
proletkult.17.a: "A great idea!"

proletkult.18.t: "Mayakovsky - The Leader Of The International Avant-Garde!"
proletkult.18.d: "Today, our leader, the great poet, the head of the futurist party, the genius of the word and the maestro of poetry, Vladimir Mayakovsky, had the courage to put forward his legitimate rights to the role of the leader of the international avant-garde.\n\n'Futurists of all countries, unite! Proletarians of all countries, unite! Artists, musicians, avant-gardists! This world belongs to us, simple workers, and not to tsars, emperors or the litter of the bourgeoisie! Down with the shackles! Long live the International!'"
proletkult.18.a: "And long live Mayakovsky!"

proletkult.19.t: "Setting Up the Ustanovka"
proletkult.19.d: "With the election of Comrade Gastev as chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he issued a decree on the immediate transition to his program 'Ustanovka'.\n\nAs part of the program, Syndicates will be created throughout the country - systematic associations of workers, industrial sectors and organizations. The All-Russian Committee of Trade Unions, the VKPS, was given executive power in the fields of economy, finance, industry and trade. With the decree adopted, the People's Commissariat of Economy and Finance was abolished, and all its People's Commissars were dismissed.\n\nThe ultimate goal of the reform is to create a Soviet-syndicalist system of government, in which all political power belongs to the Soviets, and all economic power belongs to the trade unions and syndicates. In order to avoid a conflict of interest, Gastev was appointed the new chairman of the VKPS. He will oversee both the political and economic decisions of the branches of government.\n\nIn addition, by Gastev's decision, the RKP is renamed the RSPRP - the Russian Syndicalist Trade Union Labour Party. All members of the RKP who do not agree with the current policy will be excluded from the party and ostracized."
proletkult.19.a: "A great reform!"

proletkult.20.t: "Management of Labour"
proletkult.20.d: "The Russian worker is no different from the European or American worker. Why, then, are production efficiency and labor productivity higher in their countries? It's all about standardizing production. In our country, we will create a standardization of labor.\n\nThe Russian worker does not know fatigue or sleep. He works all day for the success of his country. At least, that's what they say, but it's not true, because the Russian worker was a real slave. He used to work for the success and wealth of a capitalist. Now everything will change. Everyone gets tired. With a clearly distributed time, the worker will not get tired, and observing safety precautions, and most importantly-knowing how to work correctly, his productivity will increase significantly."
proletkult.20.a: "And so will increase country's productivity"

proletkult.21.t: "A State Without Nation"
proletkult.21.d: "Many believe that it is impossible to change the mentality of an entire nation. However, what if there is no longer any nation? In our international state, there is only a worker. The worker has no nation, he has only labor. Work that makes him well-fed and contented, and his state-strong and powerful. We are going to change the foundations of society. Down with the church! Down with the kulaks! Down with the bourgeois elements! It is necessary to take measures for the urgent collectivization of the village, the destruction of the kulaks and the promotion of the idea of proletarianism and labor!"
proletkult.21.a: "They will obey."

proletkult.22.t: "Central Institute of Labour"
proletkult.22.d: "Comrade Gastev is convinced of the need for systematic work on the study of labor processes in order to improve them. To this end, it is necessary to create a Labor Institute. He outlined the structure of the Institute of Labor at the VKPS and the methodology of its work. The Central Institute of Labor was recognized as 'an institution for the development, demonstration and promotion of the principles of scientific organization of labor and training of the labor force'.\nThe main activity of the CITA will be the problems of rationalization of methods and methods of work, training of workers. Gastev's 'Labor Attitudes (Ustanovki)' doctrine will introduce an original technology of vocational training — the "CIT system", focused on standardized, accelerated, programmed and mass training of skilled workers. This method is based on training workers in certain, most rational labor techniques for manufacturing products on the basis of dividing operations into techniques and movements, studying them and selecting the most rational ones.\n\nA special syndicate, called the 'Ustanovka' under the Gastev program, will be organized under the CIT, it will send specialists-consultants to introduce innovations in scientific work at enterprises. Foreign specialists from France and Britain will also take part in the organization of the syndicate's work. The instructors will work in all sectors of the national economy."
proletkult.22.a: "A great development!"

proletkult.23.t: "Society of Technocrats"
proletkult.23.d: "Tectology is a science formulated by A. Bogdanov, one of the prominent ideologists of the Proletkult in the 1920s in exile. It didn't get much attention from the public, but it caught Gastev's attention.\n\nIn accordance with the fundamental assumptions of tectology, two or more elements included in a single process can, with a special organization (organization), exceed the effectiveness of the functioning of these same elements separately. These ideas formed the basis of the Soviet-Syndical system.\n\nAs practice shows, the system works well, largely due to the leadership of Gastev, as a balancing element in the political system.\n\nIn addition, Bogdanov introduced the concept of technical intelligentsia. These are the most educated and successful people in our republic, who should be at the head of certain departments and manage the rest. This is exactly what is happening now, but the engineers have been joined by academics and scientists who are familiar with objectivity, empirical evidence, and progress."
proletkult.23.a: "A society, led by the cleverest!"

proletkult.24.t: "Keeping With the Time"
proletkult.24.d: "New factories are being built. Agriculture is developing. New techniques and equipment are being introduced. Villages turn into cities. Nature is mastered by man. Time is rushing forward like a steam locomotive, on the rails of progress!\n\nTime passes, and it passes quickly. But we can follow it - and we must, for the good of all mankind! With the Gastev program, our country has already achieved unprecedented results, and everything is still ahead. We have increased labor productivity several times, and the workers have finally begun to live normally and receive decent wages. Time cannot be stopped or overtaken, but we can and will do the most important thing - to keep up."
proletkult.24.a: "Time, Forward!"

proletkult.25.t: "Chairman Lunacharsky"
proletkult.25.d: "What was supposed to happen happened. Anatoly made a long way up - to the very top. Known all over the world as the ideologist and creator of the Proletkult, he is now at the top of Soviet power - the chairman of the Council of People's Commissars. Under his leadership, hundreds of employees work hard for the benefit of the motherland.\n\nMany people no longer know where Lunacharsky started - what ideas inspired him to work and develop every day to achieve general humanistic goals. Instead, with his closest associate, Alexander Bogdanov, he could sit for hours, talking about what he had not publicly mentioned or written about for a long time.\n\nAnd so, on one of these beautiful days, during an ordinary conversation, Anatoly asked: 'Alexander, but still, in your opinion..."
proletkult.25.a: "...is there a God?"

proletkult.26.t: "The Proletarian Religion"
proletkult.26.d: "Many were confused when they read in the morning papers about one of the first resolutions of Chairman Lunacharsky - about the creation of a proletarian religion in the country. Now, at the highest level, this decision has been made and will soon be implemented.\n\nBut this is a religion - not a religion in the ordinary sense of the word. This is something more than a belief in fairy tales. The proletarian religion is the belief in a different God. The one who moves our society forward - Progress. The one who brings our society together - Collectivism. And most importantly - the one who allows it all to become true - the Reason."
proletkult.26.a: "That's a brand new religion!"

proletkult.27.t: "Age of Reason"
proletkult.27.d: "The age of Reason has arrived. The decadence and degradation of the era of Tsarism and Kerenskyism led to the fact that people no longer believe in anything. Many turn to Christianity, where the church deceives them and takes away the last thing they had. Within the framework of de-Christianization, we will not kill the priests, although this is the best that could comprehend them. They will be required to adopt a new religion, and if they refuse, they will be arrested and spend their entire lives in labor. The old temples and churches will no longer serve the liars. From now on, these will be Temples of Reason and Truth, where people will be able to find the right answers to questions from the point of view of science and progress, and Marxism, of course."
proletkult.27.a: "Reason is our God!"

proletkult.28.t: "Leninism"
proletkult.28.d: "Many forget who became the scourge of the world bourgeoisie - who enlightened millions of workers around the world, who led the world's first socialist state, but was betrayed and killed by the counter-revolution?\n\nThis man is Lenin. And his ideas will live forever. Now officially the ideology of our party is called Marxism-Leninism. Lenin is not just a true revolutionary, a courageous man who fell victim to the counter-revolutionary terror of the Social Revolutionaries, but also the main personification of the revolution and socialism. He died for a great idea - a society without masters, where everyone is equal and there is no exploitation, oppression and property. A society where a person does not own a person. It was Lenin who showed us the path of true equality - what we should strive for. Even though he is no longer with us, we will always remember that he sacrificed his life to make our lives better.\n\nLet the exaltation of the memory of the national and international hero, the savior of all the weak and the poor, begin. Monuments to Lenin will be erected in the squares, and his works will be studied in schools. We will never forget his feat."
proletkult.28.a: "The Lenin case lives on!"

proletkult.29.t: "The New Era"
proletkult.29.d: "The era of the Great Bolshevik Socialist Enlightenment has begun!\n\nIlliteracy is being eradicated: all citizens of the republic are being taught to read and write, mathematics and writing! Science and technology are developing, proletarian values are being assimilated! People are beginning to believe in the god of Reason, who is leading our society forward to progress and communism!"
proletkult.29.a: "Long Live Uncle Lunacharsky!"

proletkult.30.t: "Death of Lunacharsky"
proletkult.30.d: "The great leader, the creator of Proletarian culture, the chairman of the party and just a good man, Anatoly Lunacharsky died of angina at the age of 63. His body was cremated, and an urn with his ashes was placed in the Kremlin wall on Red Square.\n\nThe whole country mourns the loss of our great and beautiful Anatoly. According to his letters to close friends, Anatoly saw Alexander Bogdanov as his successor. The Central Committee of the party decided to respect the last will of the chairman and unanimously voted for the appointment of Bogdanov as the new chairman. In addition, he is known as a good leader and his ideas, along with those of Lunacharsky, formed the basis of the proletkult program."
proletkult.30.a: "Memento mori."

proletkult.31.t: "Institute for Blood Transfusion"
proletkult.31.d: "In Moscow, by order of the chairman of Lunacharsky, the world's first scientific and practical Institute of Blood Transfusion was established, the director of which was appointed Alexander Alexandrovich Bogdanov. He claims that blood transfusion is one of the greatest achievements of modern proletarian science. Thanks to the transfusions, we will be able to save countless lives of our soldiers and citizens!\n\nHowever, there are rumors in Moscow that supposedly the Blood Institute performs rejuvenation operations! Of course, Alexander Bogdanov has for long promoted his own theory of rejuvenation, that young blood can help an aging body, but did Lunacharsky authorize these operations?"
proletkult.31.a: "We are creating a superhuman!"

proletkult.32.t: "Triumph of the Proletarian Science"
proletkult.32.d: "Thanks to the development of science, our scientists from the Radium Institute were able to invent the first cyclotron in Europe!\n\nThis is a resonant cyclic accelerator of non-relativistic heavy charged particles (protons, ions), in which the particles move in a constant and uniform magnetic field, and a high-frequency electric field of constant frequency is used to accelerate them. During the construction and operation of this cyclotron, we have accumulated invaluable experience in working with nuclear reactions, which will help us in the future in the development of nuclear energy.\n\nOur scientists say that soon, thanks to this development, more efficient and powerful machines will be invented, thanks to which it will be possible to split the core and get huge energy."
proletkult.32.a: "Can we use this for armament?"

proletkult.33.t: "Accident During Rejuvenation Operation"
proletkult.33.d: "During one of the rejuvenation operations, that is, blood transfusions, Bogdanov had to receive the blood of a young student. However, as it turned out, the student was ill with malaria and tuberculosis, which Bogdanov presumably knew about. A terrible tragedy has occurred! During the eleventh exchange transfusion with the student, rejection and death occurred. Bogdanov died as a result of the operation.\n\nThe whole country is mourning and grieving over the death of the chairman of the party - the ideologist of the proletkult and one of the smartest people in the world. He will be replaced as chairman by Valerian Polyansky, Chairman of the All-Russian Proletkult Council, editor-in-chief of the 'Proletarian Culture' publishing house, as well as the head of Glavlit and the creator of the Soviet censorship. He will be a worthy successor to Bogdanov."
proletkult.33.a: "Valerian Polyansky will be the new chairman!"

proletkult.34.t: "Collectivisation Enforced by the Reason"
proletkult.34.d: "It is time to put an end to the disunity of the peasantry and the rich in the countryside! So is the demand of the Reason! It is necessary to deprive the peasantry of class division and to introduce proletarian culture to them! Therefore, on the instructions of the chairman of Lunacharsky, the immediate collectivization of the village began! Individual peasant farms will be merged into collective farms in order to transform private individual farms into public ones in order to ensure the greatest control by the state and the party over the country's agriculture.\n\nCollectivization will solve the problem of limited distribution of industrial crops in the conditions of small individual farms and form the necessary raw material base for the processing industry. Also, the cost of agricultural products will be reduced, as well as through mechanization, the productivity and efficiency of labor in agriculture will increase.\n\nThe result of collectivization will be the availability of agricultural products to the masses in an amount sufficient to form food reserves, and supply the rapidly growing urban population with food."
proletkult.34.a: "The classic of Proletarianism!"

proletkult.35.t: "Illiteracy Defeated!"
proletkult.35.d: "Thanks to the actions of the Main Council of the Proletkult, the efforts of teachers and the party, we have completely got rid of illiteracy! The whole population of our country is trained in literacy, mathematics, writing and reading! This is a huge breakthrough that we were able to achieve! This is truly the achievement of proletarian culture and socialism - a level that the capitalist oppressors will never reach."
proletkult.35.a: "Long Live Proletkult!"

proletkult.36.t: "Totally Educated Population!"
proletkult.36.d: "The level of education of our citizens is at a very high level. We can confidently say that almost all adult citizens have received higher education or are studying to get it.\nOur country needs highly educated and skilled workers, engineers, and scientists. We will show the whole world what labor and knowledge can do!"
proletkult.36.a: "Long Live Proletkult!"

proletkult.37.t: "The Nation of Proletarians!"
proletkult.37.d: "The propaganda of proletarian ethics and aesthetics has borne fruit: we can confidently declare to the whole world that in our country everyone is faithfully devoted to socialism. The proletarians will rebuild our country and make it the most successful country in the world. For the proletarian always knows how to organize production efficiently."
proletkult.37.a: "Long Live Proletkult!"

proletkult.38.t: "Maya and Myas"
proletkult.38.d: "Always a patron of the arts, and specifically a lover of music himself, Premier Mayakovsky has gone ahead with a series of new public funding campaigns aimed at fueling the careers and genius of the Union’s greatest artist, musicians, thinkers, and more. Particularly of interest to Mayakovsky himself however, beyond his mass funding of various writers guilds and literary unions, has been his personal crusade to spread the musical genius of Nikolai Myaskovsky. Myaskovsky, frequently hailed as the Father of Soviet Symphony, is a skilled violinist, pianist, and cellist in his own right, but where he truly shines is in his compositions. None in Russia make symphonies quite like Myaskovsky, and for his talents, he is to be rewarded and utilized for the good of the state and the wider Proletariat masses. \n\nWith this reputation preceding him and with his friendship with Mayakovsky blooming, Myaskovsky - along with his lifelong friend, fellow composer, and master pianist Sergei Prokofiev, and with help from musical geniuses such as Konstantin Saradzhev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Aram Khacaturian, and Igor Stravinsky - are to head a new national union aimed at expanding and perfecting Soviet music in all forms. As our master of the pen Mayakovsky leads the nation, the master of music Myaskovsky shall lead our new cultural renaissance."

proletkult.39.d: "Celebrating the works and genius of our beloved Premier, the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers, or RAPP, has announced the creation of an omnibus composed of all of Mayakovsky’s collected literary works. Though the RAPP once was one of Mayakovsky’s most vocal sources of criticism, since his rise to power this pretentious union of poets and writers have begun to sing a different tune. Whether this change of heart was sincere or coerced, it does not matter now, for the RAPP has been made loyal, and now only speaks high praises of Mayakovsky’s work. \n\nAs such, the RAPP has published this new omnibus, containing great poems such as ‘A Slap in the Face of Public Taste’, ‘A Cloud in Trousers’, ‘Backbone Flute’, ‘The Bedbug’, ‘The Bathhouse’, and more. However, Mayakovsky’s poetry is not the only works included, for some of his own writings and favorite pieces from the art journal LEF were also published within the tome, as was Mayakovsky’s own edited version of the Futurist Manifesto, which he partially penned, among other Futurist, Bolshevik, and Socialist treatises Mayakovsky has written sporadically throughout his career. This comprehensive literary masterpiece offers a unique look into the mind and ideas of our beloved leader, and copies are to be distributed to every household within the Union. May all within Russia and beyond read of the genius and vision of Vladimir Vladimirovich Mayakovsky!"
proletkult.39.a: "All hail the best and most talented poet of our Soviet epoch."

proletkult.40.t: "Painting Reverend Gapon Red"
proletkult.40.d: "Seeking to raise more Russians as holy figures to aid in his ‘God-Building’ projects, Premier Anatoly Lunacharsky has decided to rewrite the history surrounding the Reverend Georgy Gapon. Once a populist and peaceful member of the Orthodox priesthood who championed working-class rights, Gapon was famously murdered by members of the SRs in 1906 after the failed Revolution of 1905 due to alleged evidence linking him to the royal guard and police as an informant. Despite the long-held belief that Gapon truly was a traitor to the proletarian masses, Lunacharsky has declared this account to be falsified. Instead, our ingenious leader has decided to set the record straight, revealing the truth behind Gapon. \n\nWith his synthesis of Christian views and cryptosocialist rhetoric, the godless SRs were merely intimidated by this example of heavenly righteousness, and put Gapon to death in order to stop the spread of Christian-influenced Socialism. Rewriting every account in the nation and raising Gapon up as a hero of the people and of the Party, Lunacharsky shall use the image of Reverend Gapon and others to cement his hold over the masses."

sokolnikov.1.t: "Chairman Sokolnikov"
sokolnikov.1.d: "Grigory Sokolnikov, now the new chairman of the party and head of the Council of People's Commissars, is ready to adopt new decrees, and in particular, as an economist, to start the most important thing - economic reform.\n\nDespite the fact that he was in the opposition, now his faction is in power, and the opposition is already opposing his regime. Not everyone agrees with the adoption of Bukharin's doctrine, and considers it revisionism and the same betrayal that Bukharin committed many years ago. Sokolnikov has a lot to change in the personnel of the Central Committee of the RKP, if he wants to succeed, otherwise the more radical Bolsheviks can remove him."
sokolnikov.1.a: "There's always someone non content"

sokolnikov.2.t: "Denouncing Bukharin's Betrayal"
sokolnikov.2.d: "Despite the fact that Chairman Sokolnikov is undoubtedly a convinced Bolshevik, with his acceptance of Bukharin's NEP program, his loyalty to the party began to be doubted. Many openly call him a revisionist and Bukharinist, and even accuse him of Menshevism. Of course, such an image does not contribute to the popularity of Sokolnikov, which means that urgent measures are needed for 'Debukharinization'.\n\nUndoubtedly, Sokolnikov is not an adherent of Bukharin's ideas, moreover, despite the fact that they began their journey together, Bukharin's betrayal and his decision to kowtow to Kerensky and the bourgeois-democratic government of the Petrograd regime, greatly shocked Sokolnikov. However, he could not but recognize the viability of the NEP in the early years of the transition to full-fledged socialism.\n\nIn this regard, urgent measures will be taken to ostracize Bukharin, delegitimize his party, which will be banned, and all activists will be arrested for anti-state activities. Bukharin's face will hang in every yard, crossed out and with a huge inscription TRAITOR TO SOCIALISM AND COMMUNISM!"
sokolnikov.2.a: "No mercy to traitors!"

sokolnikov.3.t: "Reaffirm Trading Contracts"
sokolnikov.3.d: "Our young republic needs to abide by trade agreements with other powers, including capitalist ones, until we can take care of ourselves. Like other decisions of Sokolnikov, this is one of the most controversial. Many believe that since we accept money from the capitalists, they can sponsor our economy on their own terms. Of course, this is not the case. Moreover, what could be better than the fact that the imperialists and capitalists pay the Socialist state, and therefore sponsor socialism?"
sokolnikov.3.a: "Send our proposals"

sokolnikov.4.t: "[FROM.GetName] Suggests Reaffirming Trade Relations"
sokolnikov.4.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] suggests that they are rightful successors of the previous democratic Russia, and, therefore, we should reaffirm our trade contracts with them. While we are not accepting that Russia has fallen to socialism, trade is always good."
sokolnikov.4.a: "No trade with socialists!"
sokolnikov.4.b: "Sure, why not."

sokolnikov.5.t: "[FROM.GetName] Rejects Trade Treaty"

sokolnikov.6.d: "The government of [FROM.GetName] agreed to reaffirm trade contracts with us as legitimate successors of the Russian Republic."
sokolnikov.6.a: "They are sponsoring socialism now."

sokolnikov.7.t: "Progressive Agricultural Tax"
sokolnikov.7.d: "By the decree of Sovnarkom, signed by Sokolnikov, the poorest strata of the society will now pay no taxes at all. At the same time, the Kulaks, who naturally exist because of the 'Capitalism in the Village' principle of NEP, are going to pay more taxes at a progressive rate, proportional to their income.\n\nBy implementing this tax, we will ensure social and economic equality in the village and stop Kulaks from becoming too wealthy."
sokolnikov.7.a: "A great reform."

sokolnikov.8.t: "Chicherin Passes Away"
sokolnikov.8.d: "The whole country today bowed their heads in mourning, having learned the news that the savior of the peasants, the successful diplomat Georgy Chicherin died. In recent years, Chicherin experienced serious health problems, and now, his heart could not stand it - the chairman died of a severe heart attack. The leadership of the country will be headed by his successor."
sokolnikov.8.a: "Rest in peace."

sokolnikov.9.t: "The All-Russian Starosta"
sokolnikov.9.d: "The Chairman of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee is nominally the highest state position in the Republic of Soviets. It became such in connection with the death of Sverdlov and the appointment of Mikhail Kalinin back in 1919. During the reconstruction of the Soviet government, the VTSIK, as well as its chairman, were restored, and Mikhail Kalinin again headed this authority. [ROOT.GetLeader] suggests that Mikhail Kalinin is a promising Bolshevik who can is capable of more useful work. As the head of the executive branch, he will have approximately the same powers as the President of the Russian Republic - that is, to represent Russia abroad, along with the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In many ways, his position will remain, of course, decorative, but the government led by [ROOT.GetLeader] will be under the head of the VTSIK."
sokolnikov.9.a: "Making the 'All-Russian Starosta' finally worthy"

sokolnikov.10.t: "Monetary Reform of Sokolnikov"
sokolnikov.10.d: "The new government began to develop a monetary reform under the leadership of party leader Sokolnikov, who headed the Finance Department. He takes a hard line and opposes solving economic problems by cavalier attacks.\nA State Bank would be established to be the main organizing force. State credit operations will be incorporated into the practice. The reform also involves the abolition of subsistence taxation. According to Sokolnikov, new gold coins, the so-called "gold chervontsy," will also appear. Various Russian economists believe this reform should really improve the Soviet economy."
sokolnikov.10.a: "Great!"

### Molotov & Kaganovich ###
molotov.1.t: "Molotov's National-Bolshevism"
molotov.1.d: "In his first speech as head of the party, Molotov announced the new course of the country - national Bolshevism.\n\nFor many delegates, this concept was not available for understanding, and therefore, the chairman made a theoretical justification for the new ideology of the party.\n\nNational Bolshevism proceeds from the obvious fact that only Bolshevism and the Bolshevik party can pull the country out of medieval feudalism and chaos. In the civil war, reaction won - and the republic was doomed. For 20 years, the peasants waited for land, and the workers for factories. But the landlords and capitalists who retained power were only enriched by German handouts.\n\nThe time of pain and suffering of our people is over. Only Bolshevism can save them. Not the syndicalism inherent in the Western countries, nor the Socialist-Revolutionary-Menshevik capitalism, nor the revisionism of Bukharin. Only one party, unjustly expelled and excommunicated from the people, can change life in the country. And this is the party of the Bolsheviks."
molotov.1.a: "Bolshevism will prevail."

molotov.2.t: "Council of Labour and Defense"
molotov.2.d: "The Council of Labor and Defense was first established in November 1918, in the midst of the blazing civil War. The Council served as an emergency "national economic cabinet", issuing emergency decrees in an attempt to support industrial production for the Red Army in the face of economic collapse.\n\nHowever, the Council of Labor and Defense did not live long, as did the power of the Bolsheviks. With the end of the civil war, the council was dissolved. However, now, according to Molotov, the council should be restored, because, as the chairman said, we are still in a state of civil war. Peasant uprisings, small-nation uprisings, capitalists and imperialists, revisionists and opportunists, Transamur traitors-all are ready to take advantage of the weakness of the Soviet republic and tear it apart.\n\nThe Labor and Defense Council will be restored. And it will be headed by Chairman Molotov. Our economy will develop by leaps and bounds, collectivization and industrialization are waiting for us - and the faster the better for us and the worse for our enemies."
molotov.2.a: "War is coming."

molotov.3.t: "The Efremovites"
molotov.3.d: "Mikhail Efremov was just a peasant from the collective farm "Iskra" of the Beloglazovsky district of the Altai Territory on the border with hostile Mongolia, became the owner of the world record yield (he received on an area of 3.6 hectares 61 quintals of wheat per hectare, and on 8.5 hectares — 54 quintals).\n\nWith his feat of organizing labor and defense of the republic, Yefremov inspired many other collective farmers, thus becoming the initiator of the movement of the country's foremost agricultural leaders for high yields. The movement has become incredibly popular, and it is quite possible that soon many citizens will be inspired by the feat of Efremov and become leaders in their industries. The movement has already received the name "Efremovites" after the initiator, and Efremov himself was appointed chairman of the kolhoz."
molotov.3.a: "Long live the socialist labour!"

molotov.4.t: "With a Hammer Blow"
molotov.4.d: "Molotov, whose party pseudonym literally translates as 'Hammer', gives great importance to labor and defense. Having enhanced the traditional hammer and sickle with a symbol once considered during the Revolution - and at the same time a symbol of defense - the sword, Molotov is ready to continue his program.\n\n'With a blow of the hammer' is the new motto of all the proletarians and peasants of the country. Only with a cold look, in the sweat of our brow, can we become stronger and more secure. We need to immediately increase the rate of production, and the sooner the better."
molotov.4.a: "All for the defense of the motherland."

molotov.5.t: "Declaring War on Unemployment"
molotov.5.d: "During the Kerensky regime, unemployment only increased every year, but those days are long gone. In our state, there will be no unemployment at all. It's very simple. Until recently, unemployed people were only condemned and subjected to social ostracism, they did not want to communicate with them, because they are not ready to serve labor and socialism. However, now everything has changed. The Council of Labor and Defense proposed to introduce administrative penalties, including fines and arrests for the unemployed, but Chairman Molotov proposed a more ingenious idea. After all, you can't argue that the unemployed are parasites. And when they run out of money to pay fines, they will sit under arrest - and rest.\n\nMolotov proposed to toughen the punishment and make it criminal. But no, they won't shoot anyone. Instead, labor camps will be created in which convicted parasites will work for the benefit of the country. The so - called General Management of the camps, under the leadership of both the Council of Labor and Defense and the Cheka, will control the work of prisoners."
molotov.5.a: "The unemployment will be eradicated."

molotov.6.t: "Triumph of Sword and Hammer"
molotov.6.d: "It is still too early to talk about a complete victory, but the foundation has already been laid. Thanks to the triumph of the sword and the hammer, our country is successfully developing from an agrarian semi-feudal backward state into an industrially developed socialist state. National Bolshevism, as a belief in the Bolshevik party and in the peoples inhabiting the territory of the former Russian Empire, triumphed in the minds of ordinary people. They realized how right the Bolsheviks were in their endeavors, how wise and clever the great chairman Vyacheslav Molotov is."
molotov.6.a: "Sword and Hammer - the key to our victory!"

### Kaganovich ###
kaganovich.1.t: "Three Brothers"
kaganovich.1.d: "The new chairman of the party, Lazar Kaganovich, has already formed a new cabinet of People's commissars, including his own brothers. This decision was criticized by some non-essential party members, who, however, soon changed their minds. However, the so-called "fraternal triumvirate" of Michael, Lazarus, and Julius was created with the aim of creating a centralized government as part of Kaganovich's fight against dissent."
kaganovich.1.a: "The Bolshevik dynasty?"

kaganovich.2.t: "Choosing Our Direction"
kaganovich.2.d: "Since the People's commissariats of the national economy and internal affairs are now under the rule of the Kaganovich brothers, Lazar must choose which of the brothers he can count on more. Mikhail, on the one hand, is a rather hot-tempered person who does not seriously focus on work, on the other hand, Julius is really a talented security officer. However, the situation in the country should also be taken into account. It is full of spies and various counter-revolutionaries, but on the other hand, the economy, already destroyed by the German henchman Kerensky, is completely ruined. It is necessary to make a decision on what to focus on."
kaganovich.2.a: "Focus on reviving economy"
kaganovich.2.b: "Focus on security"

kaganovich.3.t: "A Drunk Brawler"
kaganovich.3.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was stunned by the news that his brother Mikhail, moreover, the People's Commissar of the National Economy, was in the drunk tank last night. Like a real rowdy, Mikhail, having got drunk in the 'Rumochnaya', began to shout near the street Solyanka in Moscow 'the Internationale'. Residents of nearby houses complained about the night noise and the good thing that they called the police, and did not call directly the Lubyanka, which is only half an hour on foot. The police officer who arrived at the scene found the People's Commissar lying on the ground, seemingly unconscious, drunk in a frenzy. But in his usual manner, Mikhail was only joking. When the policeman approached the drunk and began to shake him, trying to bring him to his senses, Mikhail quickly opened his eyes and laughed in the face of the dazed policeman. Of course, soon after that, he was detained and taken to the local drunk tank in the Kitaygorodsky district. There the People's Commissar safely slept through, and in the morning, as if nothing had happened, went to work.\n\nNow he sits with a guilty face in front of the chairman, and assures him of his innocence."
kaganovich.3.a: "'You try that again, Misha, I'll be not so nice.'"

kaganovich.4.t: "Another Incident"
kaganovich.4.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that his brother Mikhail, who was also the People's Commissar of the National Economy, had failed all the deadlines for the delivery of an important agricultural object. At work, Mikhail joked a lot, shouted at the top of his voice, and did everything from playing checkers with local peasants to tipping a glass of rural moonshine. This behavior of the People's Commissar, of course, is irresponsible and destructive. Mikhail had already been warned that he would be removed from his leadership position in the party and expelled from the Central Committee. However, he did not listen to the advice and continued to behave like a ridiculous child. By the decision of the congress, it was unanimously decided to expel Mikhail from the Central Committee and appoint a more suitable person to this position.\n\nEyewitnesses say that Mikhail endured his resignation hard, ranging from a heavy drinking binge, ending with the denial of Marxism and cursing Lenin, Zinoviev, Bukharin, Yagoda, Molotov, Kamenev and, finally, his own brother Lazar. This was not good for anything, so by the decision of the party, Mikhail was appointed to the post of director of the aviation plant, where he would have been at least a little happier."
kaganovich.4.a: "Well, every family has one black sheep."

kaganovich.5.t: "No Happy-End"
kaganovich.5.d: "Lazar Kaganovich was informed that today at 6 o'clock in the morning his brother Mikhail, the director of the aviation plant, was found shot dead in his own office at the plant. Despite the fact that there are no clear reasons for what he did there so early, forensic experts agree that Mikhail did not leave the plant in the evening. Left alone with an expensive foreign cognac, Mikhail drank a bottle, and, being in an extremely intoxicated state, took a gun out of his pocket. After lighting a Cuban cigar, he sat down in a chair and wrote a suicide note in a barely legible hand. In it, he said that he could no longer live, having lost the chair of the People's Commissar. He also wrote about how great it was for him to live in exile in France and that he is very sorry that he returned to his homeland. Unable to cope with the amount of work, Mikhail decided that he was no longer needed by the country, but he remains committed to the cause of Lenin to the end.\n\nHis body was delivered in a closed coffin to Moscow, and a farewell ceremony will take place soon."
kaganovich.5.a: "Rest in peace, brother."

kaganovich.6.t: "Moscow Metro"
kaganovich.6.d: "In Moscow, the second stage of the metro opened, thanks to Kaganovich's enhanced measures for the renovation of the new capital. Back in the 1920s, with the assistance of the German company Siemens Bauunion, the Kerensky government was able to find funds for the construction of the first line of the Moscow subway. The line stretches from Ostozhenka Street to the square of Three Railway Stations. Following the plan drawn up by the Germans, Lazar Kaganovich, together with Gosplan, built new sections of the Moscow metro in record time. The new line stretched from Bryansky Railway Station to Kursky Railway Station through the center of the capital, passing under Red Square, where a huge transfer hub was built for the third line - from Rzhevsky Railway station to Saratovsky Railway Station.\n\nThis is not the end of Kaganovich's renovation, as a huge plan was made for the renovation of Moscow - watering its rivers and landscaping. New metro lines will also be opened soon."
kaganovich.6.a: "Splendid!"

kaganovich.7.t: "Kaganovich’s Social Patriots"
kaganovich.7.d: "Soon after Krestinsky became the new chairman of the party, Lazar Kaganovich became the new secretary of the RKP. Having a long story of party participation, Kaganovich quickly became the second person in the party. As Krestinsky, Kaganovich himself was inspired by the Georgian Bolshevism, even though he rejected its nationalistic and chauvinistic tendencies. In Moscow, the supporters of Kaganovich are now known as Social-Patriots and it seems that this name fits good in the new policies of the RKP. Nevertheless, Kaganovich is likely to become Krestinsky's successor in the upcoming years, so we should keep an eye on him."
kaganovich.7.a: "Interesting."

kaganovich.8.t: "Krestinsky Retires"
kaganovich.8.d: "Soon after the formation of the Union, our chairman, Nikolay Krestinsky has announced his retirement. Now he decided that this is the right time to do it. At the Party Congress, he named Kaganovich, leader of the Moscow Social Patriotic Faction, his successor and advised the Congress to vote for him. As intended, the Congress voted for Kaganovich to become the new Chairman."
kaganovich.8.a: "A new era begins."

According to the testimony, a group of 'Russian futurists' planned to establish a state with the power of the creative intelligentsia, restore ties with the capitalists and all kinds of approval of subversive activities. Another group of "Soviet syndicalists" aimed to create a state, following the example of the French and British syndicalists, where the power of the Soviets would be minimized, and the power of the trade unions would be unlimited. Lunacharsky's group proposed, contrary to the ideas of Marx and Lenin, to create a religious cult in the country. In addition, all the groups appeared to be linked to Western spies, the Mensheviks, and Bukharin's treacherous clique.

All four of them soon confessed their guilt and repented of their malicious betrayal of the Bolshevik party. Bukharin begged the court to have mercy and take into account his party experience as a Bolshevik. He also noted that he had always been devoted to Lenin's ideals and that by creating the New Bolsheviks bloc, he hoped that Bolshevism would live on. He fought for power for the sake of Lenin and the Bolsheviks, and only Kerensky prevented him from coming to power. However, this does not negate the fact that Bukharin was a malicious revisionist who departed from the ideas of Marxism and tried to convince the peasants of the correctness of capitalist relations and promoted inequality in society.\n\nThe court found Bukharin, Shlyapnikov and Rykov guilty of betraying the motherland, betraying the party and anti-Soviet terrorist activities, aiding the bourgeoisie and large capital, as well as collaborating with a left-wing Socialist-Revolutionary group. All three were sentenced to death by hanging. The court recognized Kollontai's achievements in the field of gender equality and showed mercy: she will serve 25 years in a labor camp.\n\nThe remaining members of the People's Socialist Party were arrested and their personal property seized.

Distributed over a large part of the territory, the paramilitaries prepared provocations, sabotage and terrorist attacks. The key was the destruction of a large cell in Tambov and Penza, where the number of the combat organization reached 12 thousand terrorists.\n\nIn the end, a special operation was organized to identify the location of Savinkov and organize his arrest. Savinkov was discovered - he was given out by his own people. The dangerous terrorist was discovered, disarmed, and arrested. He was taken to the main building of the NKVD, where he was held in prison. Savinkov did not repent of what he had done, denied any connection with the NPRP and behaved like an outspoken extremist. By the decision of the court, he was sentenced to death by hanging, the execution was going to be carried out on Red Square and left to rot there for the amusement of the peasants.\n\nHowever, unfortunately, the so-called leader managed to commit suicide by jumping from the 4th floor and smashing his skull.

In total, about 800 legionnaires were arrested, all of them were sentenced to life sentences.\n\nThis case also involves many leaders of the Bashkir National Movement, mostly former social revolutionaries, who also planned the creation of the Great Bashkiria as part of the Idel-Ural state. Their leader, Ahmed Walidi, also left the country, leaving most of the Bashkir terrorists behind.

The Cheka believes that General Zhukov, a young but ambitious military figure who in fact played a significant role in the restoration of Soviet power and the power of the Bolshevik Party, is also involved in the conspiracy. Many people can hardly believe that the seemingly only person in Russia who was able to resist the pressure of conservative circles and lead the workers ' uprising is actually an enemy spy and traitor. However, the evidence of the Cheka, as always, is reinforced concrete:\n\nDuring the Civil War, Zhukov did not participate in the red movement, but preferred to sit out with a wound. He did not help Lenin's cause in any way, and soon after the end of the civil war he remained in Russia and served Kornilov and Denikin like any ordinary ordinary White Guard and traitor to the revolution. Despite the fact that he later led a rebellion against the power of the Kornilov military junta and united other pro-Soviet generals, his true views remain in question.\n\nThe investigation suggests that the Zhukov uprising was sponsored by the German and Japanese imperialists in order to weaken Russia. After all, after Zhukov came to power, the lands in Siberia, as well as Karelia, were lost. The prosecution also suggests that at the beginning of the war with Germany and Japan, Zhukov will be the first to betray socialism and engage in sabotaging the army and become the head of the military junta like Kornilov.\n\nZhukov denies all charges and declares his innocence.

In the last days of the siege, when the White Guard troops had already tightly approached the capital, an event occurred known as the Petrograd Massacre, when the Bolsheviks who escaped were carrying out their last orders for mass terror. One of the executors of such orders was Blagonravov, who shed rivers of blood of the enemies of the party who surrendered Petrograd to the enemy. \n\nOn behalf of Blagonravov, about 200 enemies of the people who were directly or indirectly involved in the Bolsheviks' loss in the war were shot. Basically, their fault was their ties with the White Guard, which, according to Blagonravov, led to the imminent surrender of defense positions near Tikhvin and Novgorod. The guilt of these traitors was undeniable, and served as an important lesson for the Bolsheviks who were preparing the second revolution abroad.\n\nThis time the traitors will not have time to help the enemies."

It seems that Blagonravov sees traitors of the people everywhere, but you need to be objective in this matter. In this regard, a number of people proposed to nominate Genrikh Yagoda, an experienced Cheka officer who had already proved his loyalty to the party and worked under Blagonravov for many years, to the post of head of the Cheka.\nOn the one hand, by appointing Yagoda, we may be able to avoid mistakes, on the other hand, perhaps Blagonravov is really right, and no matter how much we would like to admit the opposite, the party and the country are full of enemies of the people.

It seems that the fight against dissent has developed even more radically and widely than under Blagonravov. Perhaps we should not doubt Yagoda, he has repeatedly proved his loyalty to the ideas of socialism, but it seems that Blagonravov was right in many respects. If, in a time of universal lies, we decide that Yagoda is also involved in an anti-Soviet conspiracy, then we should appoint a more reliable person to this position, and Yagoda should be tried together with Blagonravov as enemies of the people.

nkvd.55.d: "The Central Committee of the RKP believes that all the facts revealed during the investigation into the cases of the anti-Soviet Bukharinist center and its supporters on the ground show that the Cheka failed in exposing these worst enemies of the people.\nThe traitors of the motherland — the Bukharinists and other double-dealers, in alliance with the German and Japanese counterintelligence, managed to launch wrecking, sabotage, espionage and terrorist activities with comparative impunity, to damage the cause of socialist construction in a number of industries and in transport, not only due to the shortcomings of the work of the party and economic organizations, but also due to the weak work of the Cheka.\n\nThe analysis of the arrests shows that the main blow of the State Security bodies was not directed against organized counter-revolutionary formations, but mainly at individual cases of anti-Soviet agitation, at all kinds of official crimes, hooliganism, domestic crimes, etc.As a result, alien and criminal elements penetrated into certain parts of the State Security bodies. A number of cases have been discovered in which even foreign intelligence spies managed to infiltrate State security agencies.\n\nThe same practice of an undivided attitude to the nomination of people, as well as the lack of political educational work, created conditions under which direct traitors-Bukharinists-found themselves in the leading Chekist work. Some of them systematically informed the members of the Bukharinist organization about the materials available in the NKVD about the anti-Soviet activities of the latter.\nHowever, the delay in exposing the anti-Soviet activities of the Bukharinist bandits is due not only to these general shortcomings in the work of the State Security agencies, but also to the specific criminal activities of certain responsible Cheka employees, and especially Molchanov, Firin, and Agranov. As a result of such poor management of the agency, there were many traitors among the latter. In the course of the investigation of the anti-Soviet Bukharinist center in Moscow alone, 65 agents of traitors were identified who systematically misinformed the State Security agencies, confused the whole case, and actively contributed to the unpunished activities of the Bukharinists.\n\nIn this regard, the party leadership considers it necessary to judge Yagoda's clique, namely, including himself, as well as Molchanov, Firin and Agranov, for obstructing the work of the Cheka and the creation of an anti-Soviet Bukharinist center in the state security bodies."

However, in our reformed and reforged Union, this ever-elusive ideal has not only been achieved but fully harnessed and embraced, and it is all thanks to the glorious Chairman Yezhov. \n\nUnder the calculated, towering, and imposing rule of our beloved Chairman, the Russian people have endured great hardships and struggles, and for their sacrifices, our nation has been rewarded with true greatness as we emerge from our dark and corrupt past free and cleansed of sin, gracing true perfection under the Red Star of Bolshevism. The enemies of Russia, though numerous and unyielding, have been brought to the sword and Yezhov now guides our state down their river of blood to our new bright, crimson dawn. \n\nA perfect society has finally been forged on this imperfect and sinful Earth, righteously purged to be free from vice, desire, religion, need, and any other unseemly and craven traits and beliefs of lesser beings. The New Soviet Generation shall be the standard of the world as the true beacon of perfection and societal harmony, and under Chairman Yezhov, this generation shall be safeguarded at all costs as the pinnacle of humanity. All of Russia is safe and perfect under our glorious Chairman, and none shall rob us of this perfection as long as we still draw breath!"
nkvd.58.a: "We all live in a society, comrades!"

nkvd.59.t: "Total Control Achieved"
nkvd.59.d: "Now it became obvious to Comrade Yezhov that there were as few traitors and enemies of the people in the country as possible than ever before. Having successfully got rid of both the party opposition and the treacherous generals, our country is confidently moving forward under the wise leadership of Comrade Yezhov.\n\nOf course, there are still traitors in the country, hiding and conducting their underground activities, but soon all the rats will be caught and destroyed. In the meantime, we can enjoy the perfect society we create."
nkvd.59.a: "A Society without traitors!"

nkvd.60.t: "Chekist State"
nkvd.60.d: "Thanks to the action of the Cheka, the country was almost completely cleansed of counter-revolutionaries, opposition, spies and saboteurs.\n\nThe new country under the leadership of the wise Yagoda is a model of the truly best regime of government in recent millennia. The streets are clean, people are working and working for the good of the country, not for a fat capitalist.\n\nIt is almost a communist paradise, except that communism has not yet been built, but it will definitely be built in the coming decades, once the Red Army occupies Berlin and Vienna. In the meantime, Yagoda will continue to serve the Motherland faithfully, as he has all his life."
nkvd.60.a: "A happy society!"

tsentrobalt.1.t: "No Masters!"
tsentrobalt.1.d: "The Committee of revolutionary sailors who saved the country and pulled it out of the hell of the Bolshevik failure decided that Pavel Dybenko would serve as the country's interim leader until the transition to the stage of real anarcho-communism. As an influential sailor and a man who can restore order with a firm hand, anarchists understand that this measure is necessary while society is still unstable and the army is a serious danger.\n\nPavel Dybenko will lead the country to a bright future of anarcho-communism, where every person is equal to another, and people are brothers! And if he dares to abuse his power, we must remember that our mother is anarchy, and no one has the right to rule over another person. And if the freedom of one ends where the freedom of the other begins, then Dybenko's freedom will end very quickly."
tsentrobalt.1.a: "Anarchism is beautiful!"

tsentrobalt.2.t: "Dealing with Army"
tsentrobalt.2.d: "The army is the bulwark of one man's power over another. Even the socialist army. It is time to end the division into soldiers and officers, and the generals must recognize the fact that the army will be built on the basis of a voluntary militia, and not on a conscripted regular army of soldiers. Those who are not able to recognize this will be deprived of their position and removed from any power. From now on, the command of the army will be carried out by the anarchist defense councils."
tsentrobalt.2.a: "No masters in the army."

tsentrobalt.3.t: "Freedom for All!"
tsentrobalt.3.d: "Everyone understands that cooperation is more profitable than competition. Henceforth and forever private property is abolished! In the meantime, we have to reorganize production and consumption throughout the country, and when we achieve this goal and all the benefits of our Homeland are in the hands of the communes, we will cancel the money.\n\nIndividuals and groups will be able to use and control whatever resources they need, as our goal is to put the product, assembled or produced, at the disposal of everyone, giving everyone the freedom to consume it as they see fit in their own home."
tsentrobalt.3.a: "Equality and Prosperity."

tsentrobalt.4.t: "The Arrival of Petrichenko and the True Anarchists"
tsentrobalt.4.d: "Famed Anarchist Stepan Petrichenko came from the French commune to free Russia. In December 1917, he proclaimed the Soviet Republic of Sailors and Builders, but soon he had to evacuate to Kronstadt following rising tensions and calls for his murder among the other revolutionary factions. However, he remained committed to the ideas of anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism to the end, and he took the loss of Makhno in Ukraine and the repressive anti-anarchist policies of the Bolsheviks very hard. In the wake of their failed revolution, Petrichenko followed Makhno to France, where he became a close ally and collaborator to the famed Bat’ko and his new French allies.\n\nNow that the flag of the Central Bank is flying over Russia, Petrichenko has returned to take power from the hands of the usurper Dybenko. He publicly declared that Dybenko is not an adherent of anarchism and established himself as a notorious scoundrel, a Bolshevik brawler. The memory of Petrichenko and his anarchist commune is still alive among the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, as is the memory of who Dybenko is. \n\nDybenko, being already a representative of the Central Bank and Free Russia, was notoriously rowdy and a drunkard. Among anarchists, there was an opinion that Dybenko, indeed, is not suitable for the role of leader, and that his behavior discredits anarchism. Petrichenko's popularity is growing every day, and the anarchist communes have nominated him instead of Dybenko to represent the anarchists of Russia abroad. As in the case of Dybenko, his role will be nominal, but maybe it will be better when we are represented by a recognized anarchist, and not some Bolshevik drunkard and murderer? \n\nHowever, opposing both of these viewpoints is a third, far more radical option. Arriving in Russia with his old ally and friend Petrichenko, the beloved Bat’ko - or father - Nestor Makhno has integrated himself by Petrichenko’s side and has served as an international beacon for anarchists across the world to bear witness to. With his reputation, his devotion to true Anarchism, and his popularity among our movement all preceding him, many have come to demand that neither Dybenko or Petrichenko should guide our new anarchist society, but instead it should be Bat’ko Makhno as the one who will be our shepherd. Though Makhno’s failures in Ukraine during the revolution still hang in the air, these past missteps have only served to fuel his drive, and with the other heads of the movement at each other's throats, Makhno may very well be the best candidate to preserve the unity of our movement as well as its total dedication to Anarchist principles. What shall our final say be - would our new anarchist movement best be in the hands of a respected anarcho-communist revolutionary, a drunken sailor and war hero, or the father of modern slavic anarchism himself?"
tsentrobalt.4.a: "Get rid of Dybenko!"
tsentrobalt.4.b: "Dybenko shall stay."
tsentrobalt.4.c: "Mother Anarchy loves her sons, but so too does the Father. Makhno is our man!"

tsentrobalt.5.t: "Plunder the Loot!"
tsentrobalt.5.d: "Once Lenin announced the slogan: "Plunder the Loot!" And it made sense.\nFor centuries, ordinary people were robbed: first by the tsars, then by the capitalists, and other exploiters. Their so-called property was looted illegally, because they used violence against others. They should no longer own it, and now it's national property! Everyone has the right!\n\nLoot the looters, people! Take it as your personal property and use it. There's nothing wrong with taking it back. And so it will be until all the property stolen over the years by the capitalists becomes public property"
tsentrobalt.5.a: "That's fair."

### New Congress Focuses ###
SOV_Premier_Volsky: "Premier Volsky"
SOV_Premier_Volsky_desc: "Vladimir Volsky has been named the head of our Party. As an avid Socialist and supporter of the Revolution his appointment is seen as unsurprising by many. His devotion to the party goes back to 1903 and has since kept a close friendship with the Spiridonova. While, for one reason or another, Spiridonova herself was unable to secure leadership to many of her supporters, Volsky is the next best thing. Promising to return the PSR to its revolutionary roots he has gained many followers and now the establishment trembles as it waits for his next move."

SOV_Premier_Spiridonova: "Premier Spiridonova"
SOV_Premier_Spiridonova_desc: "The Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution, Maria Spiridonova has secured leadership over the Soviets. Under her leadership a revolutionary fire has been lit. Whether she will succeed where others failed however remains to be seen."

SOV_Premier_Bukharin: "NSP Victorious"
SOV_Premier_Bukharin_desc: "The NSP, the new cover for the Bolsheviks, has taken control over Russia. This is a 180 degree turn from the regime of the previous years and just a few months ago would’ve been seen as impossible. However, the impossible has indeed happened. Lenin gave his life for the Revolution and now the Revolution is complete, without Lenin and totally within the bounds of the Law. What happens next is going to shape the history of Russia and the world for generations.."

SOV_Premier_Bukharin_2: "Premier Bukharin"
SOV_Premier_Bukharin_2_desc: "Nikolai Bukharin, one of the last Old Bolsheviks still committed to the Revolution in Russia, has stayed as a head of the Party. This is an unsurprising development. While other old Bolsheviks reintegrated into Russian society or fled abroad, he remained in Russia. He was a close follower of Lenin but since the failure of the Revolution he has moved to the right. His support of the NEP and his thoughts on ‘Market Socialism’ have some questioning where his loyalties lie. In any case, he leads the Party now so where he goes, they all must follow."

SOV_Premier_Lozovsky: "Premier Lozovsky"
SOV_Premier_Lozovsky_desc: "Solomon Lozovsky has been elected to lead the Party. He is an unorthodox candidate, having fallen out with Lenin over the party's increased dictatorial slant under him. Instead he drew closer to the French unions during a stint in exile in the country in 1914. Now at the head of the Party he will probably seek to liberalize the party and mend the schisms of old. Whether he will succeed is another matter. No matter what he decides to do he will have to fight both internal and external dissention to do it."

SOV_A_New_Female_Image: "A New Female Image"
SOV_A_New_Female_Image_desc: "For too long the man has dominated the female. She has been expected to stay at home, tend to the house and remain little more than a slave to her husband. Premier Spiridonova has no qualms in revealing the hypocrisy of the Party, loudly promoting the equality of all while leaving women behind. Under her rule however there will be no patriarchal house slave relationship. All marriages will be equal unions, under the Law as well as any other measure. The New Soviet Woman will be strong and free, an equal pillar of any household. There will be grumbling from the conservatives but let them grumble. They will come crawling back to us when their wives taste true freedom and leave them behind."

SOV_Rural_Obschinas: "Rural Obschinas"
SOV_Rural_Obschinas_desc: "Obschina was once a Russian community of peasants and farmers, who live in the same village and share common ownership. With the socialization of land, the Obschinas are slowly coming back to life, improving cooperation and communalism between the rural dwellers."

SOV_Rural_Obschinas_tooltip: "(Every [ROOT.GetAdjective] §Hrural§! §Gcore state§!):\n  Add the following:\nResource Gain Efficiency [?0.15|=G%2]\n§HLocal Supplies:§! [?0.30|=G%0]"

SOV_Revolutionary_Narodism: "Association of Left Narodism"
SOV_Revolutionary_Narodism_desc: "The People is the revolutionary force in our country. Only with the means of true popular power we can achieve equality for all."

SOV_Socialist_Democracy: "Socialist Democracy"
SOV_Socialist_Democracy_desc: "For many Socialism is synonymous with dictatorship. This is a holdover from the time of Lenin whose rule was almost as despotic as the Tsar he helped overthrow. We will remedy that problem. We will introduce democracy to the nation, true democracy equal as befitting the Socialist platform. This will endear us to the people and while Marx and Lenin may turn in their graves, times have changed and democracy is required for a state to function."

SOV_Socially_Owned_Economy: "Socially Owned Economy"
SOV_Socially_Owned_Economy_desc: "For too long a cabal of fat cat monopolies have owned large sectors of the Russian economy. This is simply untenable. Not only does this stifle any innovation and restrict the natural growth of our GDP, but it maintains the kleptocratic rule of the elites. We must smash these monopolies and localise the ownership of the factories if we are to solve this problem. The heavy hand of the state will work wonders in this endeavor. With our control over the apparatus of state there is little these holdovers of a bygone era can do against us. When we give the factories back to the people they will rejoice and work twice as hard. They will, won't they?"

SOV_Elect_New_Soviets: "Elect New Soviets"
SOV_Elect_New_Soviets_desc: "With our program already positively affecting the people we should make a move to sideline other factions of the Party. By electing new local Soviets across the nation we will accomplish many things. One, we will strengthen our mandate when the people turn out in droves to support our candidates. Two, we will sideline dissenting factions in the party. With us in control of many levels of government we can more effectively institute our agenda and bypass the internal party schisms that affect us."

SOV_Decentralised_Planning: "Decentralised Planning"
SOV_Decentralised_Planning_desc: "By instituting quotas and mandatory minimum production levels we will only hurt our nation. This will encourage lying and corruption should the quotas not be met. Therefore we will break down planning to a lower level and allow them to set their own production targets for the year. If these are met then the workers and their managers get rewards, if not, no harm done. With this system of Decentralized planning we can have a more effective economy."

SOV_Socialization_Of_Land: "Socialization of Land"
SOV_Socialization_Of_Land_desc: "Much of Russia’s land was not under control of common people for centuries. The Agrarian Project of SRs shall be finally realized in practice, as it was meant to be. While experts warn that this could have adverse effects and even cripple our already struggling agricultural sector, we will go ahead with this, damn the consequences."

SOV_Amnesty_To_Political_Prisoners: "Amnesty to Political Prisoners"
SOV_Amnesty_To_Political_Prisoners_desc: "Russia’s prisons are crushed by the weight of political prisoners swept up in the revolutionary fervor that followed our ascent to power. These men are largely old men and young boys who cannot hope to resist our rule now, even if they wanted to. To relieve the pressure on our strained system we will release the least dangerous of those political prisoners. While explicit counterrevolutionaries will of course be excluded from this amnesty by doing this not only will we free up cells for more deserving criminals but we will win more sympathy with the people, who will see this more as an act of kindness than anything else."

SOV_Valkyrie_Of_Russian_Revolution: "The Valkyrie of Russian Revolution"
SOV_Valkyrie_Of_Russian_Revolution_desc: "Maria Spiridonova, the leader of our state is called the Valkyrie of the Russian Revolution by some newspapers and politicans."

SOV_Labour_Republic: "Labour Republic"
SOV_Labour_Republic_desc: "The narodnik concept of the structure of Russia as a Labor Republic of the Soviets is the most successful variant of the development of our Motherland. Despite the fact that the concept was corrupted by the Bolsheviks, its true meaning is in the people's power and representation through the Soviets, and not in the power of a single party."

SOV_Farmers_Instead_Of_Peasants: "Farmers Instead of Peasants"
SOV_Farmers_Instead_Of_Peasants_desc: "While to anybody else a peasant is a farmer we know differently. The Peasants do not own their farms like farmers, they rent them from landlords who barely know what they own. This also means that peasants have little motivation to farm more than they absolutely need. However, if we were to seize the land from the landlords and give them to the people who actually work that land, they could be motivated to not only farm for subsistence, but in excess for the greater good of the people."

SOV_Soyuzmultfilm: "Soyuzmultfilm"
SOV_Soyuzmultfilm_desc: "We have created an animation studio composed of talented individuals from all over the union, as well as with the support and expertise of foreign defectors from Japan and the USA, built from the nationalized carcass of the two largest animator groups based in Moscow. Rebuilt and rebranded, this new, state-run institution is expected to bring the joys of Socialist thought to the masses, and especially to our youth, through pre-approved programming and quality animation. Already, Soyuzmultfilm has begun to touch the hearts of thousands across Russia as masters of the craft such as Ivan Ivanov-Vano, Vladimir Suteev, Olga Khodataeva, Vladimir Polkovnikov, Leonid Amalrik, the Brumberg sisters, and many others work endlessly to churn out new media for the masses to consume. With these enlightening, entertaining hand-drawn animations being churned out, we shall entice and educate the masses with the true glory of Socialist artistic expression."

SOV_Tax_The_Workers: "Tax the Workers"
SOV_Tax_The_Workers_desc: "Any nation runs on money, even a paradise such as ours. We will put down a tax code focused on the Workers. As the richest of the sympathetic classes we can use them to gain more money while also putting that money to good use in social programs to help them. The taxes won't be as stifling as they were under Kerensky but any taxes will be unpopular. However we have no choice, whether it's this or bankruptcy."

SOV_Down_With_Nep: "Down with NEP"
SOV_Down_With_Nep_desc: "The NEP is just capitalism in red paint! Bukharin came up with it in an attempt to win over the bourgeois. However the private ownership of land, and the extraction of profits from said land, is not Socialist doctrine. It has alienated us from other left wing parties we could use to boost our power and as such its more of a liability than a strength. We will abandon Bukharin’s pseudo-capitalism."

SOV_Tax_The_Peasants: "Fight the Kulaks"
SOV_Tax_The_Peasants_desc: "We must focus our tax code on the more numerous peasant class. While not materially wealthy they have other ways of payment. If money can not be given they can give up a portion of their harvest or, if they have no extra to spare, can work on public projects for a certain amount of time. This rises bile in the more idealistic Bolshevik’s mouths as they see this as just punching down. However focusing on the workers as they suggest would just bankrupt our growing middle class, something that would tank any modern economy."

SOV_A_Paradise_For_Workers: "A Paradise For Workers"
SOV_A_Paradise_For_Workers_desc: "We have achieved the impossible and made Russia a true paradise for workers. Everybody knows what they are doing and why and the government coordinates everything to make sure nothing is wasted. Claimed inefficiencies are simply fabrications as our prosperity is proof enough of our success. Meanwhile our nation reaches new levels of prosperity day over day."

SOV_Supplant_Private_Sector: "Supplant Private Sector"
SOV_Supplant_Private_Sector_desc: "The private sector, foolishly allowed to grow like a tumor upon the healthy body of Russia, has been Bukharin's greatest folly. For in his blind quest to throw away our entire proud Marxist legacy Comrade Nikolay has made a deal with the devil of capital, in many cases the greatest of devils which is foreign capital. But we say no more! The time has come for the people of Russia to free themselves of the capitalist shackles imposed onto them by whom they trusted with bringing true socialism, it's time to revise the revisionists and launch a grand-scale nationalization campaign."

SOV_Premier_Tomsky: "Premier Tomsky"
SOV_Premier_Tomsky_desc: "Mikhail Tomsky, prominent Trade Unionist, has been elected to lead the Party and State. As a Trade Unionist many consider his loyalties to the Bolshevik orthodoxy suspect. Few however can doubt his true convictions. He is an avid supporter of the democratic process, the trade unions who form his powerbase and the factory workers who make them up. With him at the head of the Soviet state there is little doubt that a new, kinder regime is on the way in, a severe change from the Dictatorship of the Proletariat spoken of by Lenin and Marx."

RUS_Strengthen_Trade_Unions: "Strengthen Trade Unions"
RUS_Strengthen_Trade_Unions_desc: "Without the trade unions attaining more power in a system originally designed without that in mind the workers shall never know true freedom. That is why Premier Tomsky announced a set of new laws designed to increase the power and privilege the cooperatives, syndicates and other forms of industrial unity may have in the Socialist Republic."

SOV_Industrial_Democracy: "Industrial Democracy"
SOV_Industrial_Democracy_desc: "The vision many in recent decades have fought so hard for across the entire globe, the ideal of Industrial Democracy, in which the people can exercise their democratic rights through the unions controlling the economy, has been so far foreign to the governing echelons of Russia. Yet this syndicalist dream has swayed the delegates and chairmen of the various soviet bodies inside our Republic, allowing our faction to slowly usher in a true working man's paradise."

SOV_Separate_Trade_Unions_From_Party: "Separate Trade Unions from Party"
SOV_Separate_Trade_Unions_From_Party_desc: "Trade Unions cannot act as they should if they are little more than puppets of state control. We must depoliticise the Trade Unions so they can act in their members best interest and not explicitly the States. This has already drawn ire from the more suspicious members of our political sphere who see the Unions as a vulnerability able to be used by counterrevolutionaries to influence the state away from Socialism. However, countermeasures are already in place to ensure that any populists in disguise are being weeded out. Besides, the worker loves the state and would do nothing to harm it."

SOV_Premier_Rykov: "Premier Rykov"
SOV_Premier_Rykov_desc: "We have elected the Old Bolshevik Aleksey Rykov to lead the party. While some in the party, like Rykov’s friend Tomsky, wanted to federalize the state and give the Republics more autonomy, Rykov himself has pledged to consolidate power more under the Premier and resist the turn to Syndicalism that has permeated the left. This has led some to worry that Rykov seeks to become a dictator but Rykov stresses that the state can have a centralized authority and follow the democratic socialist process as well. Time will tell if he can uphold his promise."

SOV_Premier_Kirov: "Premier Kirov"
SOV_Premier_Kirov_desc: "Sergey Kirov has become Premier of our new state. As a Centralist he has made many enemies in the Party but his populism has made him widely popular among the general populace. This popularity has lent our regime a new degree of stability and legitimacy that it previously lacked. Kirov has declared that with the people on our side there is little we cannot do, and many have begun to agree with him."

SOV_Peoples_Premier: "People's Premier"
SOV_Peoples_Premier_desc: "Sergey Kirov is one of the most popular men in Russia right now, hands down. He has been especially attractive to the women of Russia who send him literally tons of mail professing their love, seemingly not knowing or wilfully forgetting the fact that Kirov is a married man. Despite that his personal charisma has enraptured the nation and the People have united under him, ready to follow him in all his future endeavors. With such universal domestic acclaim  there is little that remains outside his reach."

SOV_National_Communist_Doctrine: "Centralist Doctrine"
SOV_National_Communist_Doctrine_desc: "Many still wonder if Premier Rykov is devoted to his Centralism or if he will simply allow the status quo to continue. Rykov however, has no intention of letting the status quo limp forwards. Giving too much autonomy to the provinces and republics of our nation is a disaster waiting to happen. Giving them the chance to openly disagree with the government will waste valuable time in getting a consensus when such a state should already be assumed. So, Rykov has decided to announce his commitment to Centralising the state in a speech today and let no man wonder what Rykov’s goals may be."

SOV_Complete_Nationalization: "Complete Nationalization"
SOV_Complete_Nationalization_desc: "If you give capitalists an inch they will take a mile. We cannot allow private ownership within our state. We have already done so much to destroy the bourgeois, to let them reestablish themselves would be criminal. We shall nationalize all business within Russia. Everything from the grandest mines to the smallest store will be seized for the betterment of us all."

SOV_Hypercentralization: "Hypercentralization"
SOV_Hypercentralization_desc: "We should not only centralize our state and economy, we should ensure that is all in control of the Party and government. Without total control, we will soon face inefficiencies that will prevent our economy from becoming a leading industrial power."

SOV_Creating_An_Efficient_Economy: "Creating an Efficient Economy"
SOV_Creating_An_Efficient_Economy_desc: "Or mass nationalization has been done haphazardly and without much thought. Red tape smothers many factories and confusing spheres of authority has caused some infighting between various Commissariats. Bad actors within the system have exploited this inefficiency for profit and already our economy is feeling the weight of our sagging production. We must trim down on this excess fat if we are to achieve greatness. "

SOV_Centralized_Republic: "Centralized Republic"
SOV_Centralized_Republic_desc: "We have fully centralized the state into our hands. While in other people's view this may be seen as authoritarian and dictatorial. However, within our nation we have proven our good intentions. The people work in the factories, owned and provided for by the state, go to homes paid for by the state and live in cities maintained by the state. The state oversees all and makes sure all of its children live long, happy and healthy. The people have a direct stake in working as well since the more they work the more the state can invest back into them. It truly is a workers paradise."

SOV_The_Workers_Constitution: "The Workers' Constitution"
SOV_The_Workers_Constitution_desc: "Constitutions have, throughout history, been made by and for the interests of big business and the kleptocracies that run most capitalist nations. They speak highly of the inherent and inalienable rights of the nation's people while the politicians work diligently to undermine those rights so their friends can make another dollar. Our nation however has revealed the first true Workers’ Constitution, built by and for the Workers of our nation. The rights of freedom of speech, assembly, association, press and thought among many others are the first declarations of this new Constitution. It also mandates vacation days, time off work, equal rights for all, among many many others. All in all the Workers’ Constitution is longer than the famed Constitution of the US, upheld by many as the template for democracy, and contains many of the rights that were not in the original. Now the worker may bask in its protections, safe from all discrimination."

SOV_Peasants_Republic: "The Workers' and Peasants' Republic"
SOV_Peasants_Republic_desc: "We have founded a Republic based and run by the Workers and Peasants. The typical republic quickly devolves into an elitist and populist hellscape where the worker toils for years with no hope of liberation. In our new Republic however the people are and will always be the driver of political force. The power pyramid goes from the bottom up and not the top down. Many figure that this populist slant will leave us vulnerable to ideologues but we know the people will not be so easily seduced by words alone. Our struggles prove that the people demand action, something only we can give them and they reward us handsomely."

SOV_Profintern: "Profintern"
SOV_Profintern_desc: "Lozovsky has suggested to create Profintern - a new economic international agency that will help to improve economies of all socialist countries in the world."

SOV_General_Education: "General Education"
SOV_General_Education_desc: "The RSRPI suggests that we should introduce general free education for children aged from 6 to 16, at public schools, in order to make our future generations literate and educated."

SOV_Cheap_Housing: "Cheap Housing"
SOV_Cheap_Housing_desc: "We should build cheap houses for our citizens and provide the whole country with good affordable housing."

SOV_Premier_Kuznetsov: "Premier Kuznetsov"
SOV_Premier_Kuznetsov_desc: "Premier Bukharin is dead! In an emergency meeting the Central Committee has elected Alexey Kuznetsov to lead the nation. Kuznetsov’s election heralds a radical shift away from the ideals of Bukharin. Kuznetsov’s positions include abolishing the Union and centralizing all the Republics into autonomies under the Russian state and opposing the NEP, the brainchild of Bukharin. Some condemn him as a reactionary and as a Russian supremacist but that seems to have not done anything to dissuade his supporters. Nevertheless with Kuznetsov at the helm the Union is careening down an uncertain path that will lead it to evermore greatness or destroy it entirely."

SOV_Premier_Ryutin: "Premier Ryutin"
SOV_Premier_Ryutin_desc: "With Premier Bukharin dead the Central Committee has elected Martemyan Ryutin as the new Premier. While a supporter of Bukharin, Ryutin also maintains a closer ideological relation to Lenin. This signifies a break from the strict Bukharinist that many expected the Party to tow while still not alienating Bukharin’s many followers and allies within the Party. Some of Ryutin’s principle pillars are the opposition to the radical industrialization of the nation which he claims to have had a severe effect on the economic life of the peasant. While he does still support industrialization he instead wishes it to be more measured than the rapid growth many other leaders hope for. However, with many of our neighbors both hostile and fully industrialized worries persist that a slower path to industrialization will leave us vulnerable should the Germans come."

SOV_Premier_Kosygin: "Premier Kosygin"
SOV_Premier_Kosygin_desc: "The death of Premier Bukharin has required a new vote to who would take over. This has had the expected result of pushing Alexei Kosygin to lead the nation. As a staunch Bukharinist and a close friend and ally of the former Premier, few doubted his nomination was anything less than inevitable. Under his rule it is expected the nation will continue to reform along the path laid by Bukharin."

SOV_Cooperative_Economy: "Cooperative Economy"
SOV_Cooperative_Economy_desc: "A nation needs an economy that works for all and not the few at the top. That is why we will continue to form our new economy around the cooperatives that have sprung up on Bukharin’s insistence. With everybody working in tandem with each other and profiting equally from their labor they will be further motivated to even greater heights of prosperity. Hand in hand we shall make the Soviet economy the greatest in the world!"

SOV_Strengthen_Khozraschyot_System: "Strengthen Khozraschyot System"
SOV_Strengthen_Khozraschyot_System_desc: "The Khozraschyot System is a contradiction in that it’s both a revolutionary institution while also being common sense. With the State footing the bill for much of our industry they have been allowed to grow beyond their means. This has left factories underutilized and inefficient. We shall begin to roll back our subsidies and oversight to force business to reel itself back in. This will lead to a certain amount of businesses' shuttering as their model collapses without the blank check given to them by the government but that is for the best. It's like culling the herd. The sick and weak must die for the rest of us to grow stronger."

SOV_Capitalism_In_City: "Capitalism in City?"
SOV_Capitalism_In_City_desc: "A truly radical proposition has come before us for approval. It proposes that we allow some large cities within our nation, the ones recommended being Moscow and Petrograd, to practice measured capitalism outside our State run apparatus. These cities, termed as Free Economic Zones, will be used to entice investment from foreign companies while our strict oversight maintains said pollution remains confined to these cities. Some within our party have pushed for this for some time. They claim outside investment will only boost our economy to higher heights. Meanwhile the rest of the Party has reacted severely to this. They claim this is a naked attempt to undercut the Revolution and everything it stands for. They argue introducing capitalism, no matter how ‘measured’ , will just give the international bourgeoisie a toehold in our nation to undermine our government and encourage counterrevolution. Despite their protests however the proposal has been passed, now we wait to see if their predicted apocalypse comes to pass. "

SOV_Full_Market_Socialism: "Full Market Socialism"
SOV_Full_Market_Socialism_desc: "With the radical economic changes having been instituted as of late we have moved closer than ever to instituting Market socialism. This differs as the government will step back from all non-labor based jobs like those in the service industry. These industries will be allowed to self regulate and operate but still be publicly owned. The profits from such ventures will be given back to the employees or reinvested into social programs."

SOV_Allow_Urban_Cooperatives: "Allow Urban Cooperatives"
SOV_Allow_Urban_Cooperatives_desc: "Before now most of the cooperatives within our nation were farmers co-ops based in the countryside. However, many in the factories and cities of our nation have begun to attempt to form cooperatives of their own. Before then they have been approved on a case by case basis for various reasons. However, now with our economy in full swing we have deemed the time right to extend the cooperative system into the cities as well. Factories, public transportation and shops and stores will all be able to unite into cooperatives to better manage themselves and return the workers power to their workplace."

SOV_Bukharinist_Platform: "Bukharin's Cult of Personality"
SOV_Bukharinist_Platform_desc: "Premier Bukharin was a crusader for the people! A close confidant of Lenin, standard bearer of the Revolution after Lenin’s death and the vanguard of the Party for its existence since the Civil War we shall honor him like he deserves. We shall raise him to the equal status of Soviet Hero of the People and explain to everybody just how critical he was in them acquiring the freedoms they now enjoy. Even now, after death he watches over the Revolution and guides it forwards to its inevitable conclusion, the unification of the World Proletariat."

SOV_Peoples_Economy: "People's Economy"
SOV_Peoples_Economy_desc: "With our economy humming along we have hard numbers to prove that our economic theories have real legs to stand on. When we first came to power few expected our success. We were said to be naive idealists whose failure will give ‘more sensible’ ideas the opportunity to take the limelight. Their predictions have now however been proven to be manifestly false. The people are prosperous, our economy rivals any other on the planet and Soviet goods are exported across the world to be eagerly bought by those who marvel at the ingenuity of the Soviet Worker. With the success of our Revolution, comrades across the globe are encouraged that they will be able to bring the Revolution to their homes as well."

SOV_Peoples_Enterprises: "People's Enterprises"
SOV_Peoples_Enterprises_desc: "As part of our radical economic program we have allowed private business ownership within the state system. This has been a major risk as it could have easily inspired latent reactionary capitalist retaliation. However, our system of People’s Enterprises has worked wonders. People own their business and keep a portion of the profits while handing the rest over to the local cooperative. This cooperative then distributes it to needy businesses or invests in local social wellbeing programs like homeless shelters. This has both stimulated economic growth and rejuvenated the decaying cityscapes that dotted our nation."

SOV_Leninist_Platform: "Leninist Platform"
SOV_Leninist_Platform_desc: "We have stuck to the Path of Lenin and it has paid dividends. Our people are happy, our nation prospers and the Revolution has never been stronger. When Lenin was shot dead in the dark days of 1918 many feared his cause, the cause of the People, was to be forever crushed under the heavy boot of reaction. However Premier Ryutin has made him proud as the inheritor to the Revolution. By merging the ideas of Bukharin and Lenin he has formed the perfect brand of socialism which has finally had its chance to prove itself on the world stage. As we grow ever more powerful under the band of Leninist-Bukharinism the forces of international reaction cower in fear. Our success has emboldened their people to take the rights they are owed and the Revolution grows ever closer to home."

SOV_The_Union_For_People: "The Union For People"
SOV_The_Union_For_People_desc: "Our Union is a Union for all people, not just Russians. We seek not to dominate like the Germans or to exploit like the Americans or British. Instead we will not stop until all people are equal to each other and no man can dominate another. While the worldwide proletariat will get their liberation in due time at their own hands or ours, we first must focus on the internal sphere. Russophilia within the Union is rampant with many Russians feeling that, as the largest component of the Union, they deserve to dominate it. To counter this we will allow talented men from the other Republics to rise to public positions of prominence and show to the world and our people that this is not a Russian union, but a Union of Equals, a Union of People."

SOV_Soviet_Middle_Class: "Soviet Middle Class"
SOV_Soviet_Middle_Class_desc: "The Middle Class is the cornerstone to a consumer economy like ours. Until now we had a modest middle class with most people falling into the classification of poor laborer or the destitute. We must stimulate the growth of the middle class to stimulate the growth of the economy. We will institute a universal basic income, raise the minimum wage and start a program to house all of the Union’s people. With their basic needs met people can focus on luxuries like vacations and more importantly, social spending at places like restaurants and shops."

SOV_Enrich_Yourself: "Enrich Yourself!"
SOV_Enrich_Yourself_desc: "Socialism should not require poverty. To many the idea of a rich socialist seems to be an oxymoron. However, within our nation we have slowly grown a new class of wealthy people. However, these people are different from their compatriots in other nations in that they know the value of community and philanthropy. Not only will wealth caps make sure they do not accrue too large a hoard, but their constant donations to their local areas and to social programs has kept them well off, but not moguls like existed in the West. This shows the true power of our state. Not only have we shaped a compassionate and egalitarian economy, but we have also tamed the most reactionary of classes, the wealthy."

SOV_Russian_National_Syndicalism: "Russian National-Syndicalism"
SOV_Russian_National_Syndicalism_desc: "Our nation has adopted Premier Kuznetzov’s ideas of National Syndicalism. The central tenet of this belief is the idea of subjecting the various Republics of the Union into autonomies under Russia, a National Syndicate as it were. This has angered the minorities within the Union and has led many of the Republics to threaten to secede. We know our cause is righteous. We can overcome them, we will overcome them. Let them shout until they are blue in the face, it can’t change the future."

SOV_Oppose_Unionists: "Oppose Unionists"
SOV_Oppose_Unionists_desc: "The Union is a weak thing. The Republics are all equal in the eyes of the law and therefore overlapping authority has left many things unfinished as bureaucrats bicker over who should take precedence. This has crippled any cross-Republic trade as well. Not only that but populists could easily take over a Republic or two and throw the whole Union into chaos! We must expose the weaknesses of the Union to the people and make the case that it needs to be replaced if we are to have true safety and security. This will boost our share of the people’s support while also undercutting the many Unionists still within the government."

SOV_Class_Unity: "Class Unity"
SOV_Class_Unity_desc: "The classes have always been stratified. Our Revolution sought to do away with the arbitrary differences and unite the people behind the one Struggle for International Liberation. Then Bukharin came to power. With his proto-capitalist doctrine the old classist lines have once again been forged as the have nots once more toil away for the benefit of the haves. Except this time the upper crust claims to do what it does for the benefit of the lower classes. This naked hypocrisy cannot stand. Just like before we will break the boundaries of class and this time we will make sure they will not form again. We will have total equality and as a result, total class unity, and the people will finally get the freedom from class oppression they so hoped for."

SOV_Syndicalization: "Syndicalization"
SOV_Syndicalization_desc: "We shall begin our first real attempt to reform the political sphere of the Union. Until now most of the workers operated in Soviets with varying degrees of autonomy from the State. This cannot stand. If Russia is to remain the vanguard of the International Proletarian Revolution then it must stand as such united and focused in purpose. To that end we shall abolish the Soviets and instead reconstitute them as Syndicates. These Syndicates will be under stricter state control and more effectively and efficiently manage the areas they oversee. Meanwhile any disputes between the Syndicates will be solved by the State, rather than by the long and complex system of arbitration as with the Soviets."

SOV_Subjugate_The_Republics: "Subjugate the Republics"
SOV_Subjugate_The_Republics_desc: "The Republics have been too independent for too long. They are fickle and can easily fall prey to the petty despotism that comes with populist movements. If we let them go on like they are, it will be a matter of when they tear the nation apart, not if. To that end Kuznetzov has decreed the immediate dissolution of the Republics. This decree has been met with uproarious anger from the Republics and many have begun to openly discuss leaving the Union. This is flagrantly illegal and also, conveniently, just the pretext we need for this new purge. We shall use any means necessary to upend the dissentious Unionist control over the Republics and replace them with men more amicable to our cause. This will be very risky, some will not come quietly and we are already alerting the Army to respond to potential revolts. However the Red of the Revolution comes from the blood shed by the heroes who fought for it. By the end of this deluge there will be plenty more of heroes' blood seeping into the Russian earth."

SOV_Enforce_Autonomisation: "The Course For Autonomization"
SOV_Enforce_Autonomisation_desc: "The Republics enjoy near total autonomy from the Russian homeland. This is a sad state of affairs we will fix, but slowly. We shall begin to whittle away at the edges of Republican autonomy. It will be a slow, agonizing process but it is nevertheless necessary. If we move too quickly they could act now and overpower us but if we wait we can present them a fait accompli. They will be powerless to respond and we can roll them all up at once, without much bloodshed. "

SOV_Subordinate_Unions_To_VTSPS: "Subordinate Unions to the VTsSPS"
SOV_Subordinate_Unions_To_VTSPS_desc: "The Unions have been too independent. While still more controlled than the Republics they have been centers of dissension for ages with the infamous fractiousness of the left largely coming from their ranks. We shall reign in their autonomy under the All Russian Central Congress of Trade Unions. Under Congressional watch the unions will be more motivated to boost productivity, clamp down on dissension and maintain party unity. Not only that but with all the Unions reporting to one central body we can more effectively coordinate their efforts to maximize the economic potential they can bring."

SOV_Dissolve_The_Union: "Dissolve the Union"
SOV_Dissolve_The_Union_desc: "It is done. The Union is dead. Kuznetzov’s dream of a unified Russian Syndicate, one united behind him for the efforts of the Revolution, has been made manifest. The Autonomies heed to his beck and call, the Army marches before him ready to destroy the enemies of the Revolution, the workers work doubly as hard as they did before, confident that with every bolt they make, every gun they manufacture, the World Revolution grows ever nearer. At the same time the world trembles in fear as the Russian bear pushes aside her previous decades of inaction and hibernation and wakes once more, angry and ready for vengeance against all those who wish to see her laid low."

SOV_Premier_Zhdanov: "Premier Zhdanov"
SOV_Premier_Zhdanov_desc: "With our dear Premier's death, the responsibility of leading Russia towards full realization of Communism falls to his close confidant and chosen successor - Andrei Zhdanov. A former member of the RKP, Zhdanov abandoned the Zinovievist party over disagreements with their interpretation of the ideological works of Lenin. Eventually, he joined the NSP and became aligned with the Centralist wing, becoming the man in charge of the agricultural sector after Aleksey Rykov's election. Now Zhdanov sets one goal before himself and all of Russia, the fulfillment of Rykov's and Lenin's dream through even greater central authority."

SOV_Redefine_Russian_Identity: "Redefine Russian Identity"
SOV_Redefine_Russian_Identity_desc: "While it is true that our administration focused mostly on the well being of ethnic Russians, that doesn't mean we can allow Great Russian chauvinism to hinder the drive towards Communism. If Lenin's dream is to be ever achieved, we must redefine what it means to be a Russian. No longer will it entail an ethnos or an inhabitant of Russia's borders. From now on, a new identity shall rise; a purely Soviet man for a purely Soviet nation."

SOV_Court_Zapadnaya_Faction: "Court the Zapadnaya Faction"
SOV_Court_Zapadnaya_Faction_desc: "The National-Syndicalist faction inside the Bukharinist wing of NSP might seem like a strange bedfellow to go together with our Premier Zhdanov, especially when many inside the Centralist circle call them the 'Western' faction - much to the chagrin of the highly nationalistic group. But our leader knows exactly what he is doing, and is sure that his close friend Kuznetsov can bring much needed patriotic fervor into our Sovietification project."

SOV_Soviets_Beyond_Nations: "Soviets Beyond Nations"
SOV_Soviets_Beyond_Nations_desc: "Some might think that Andrei Zhdanov's dream of a United Soviet state is nothing new, after all many other parties proposed a federation of Socialist Republics. Yet those people are missing one crucial detail, such unions still uphold the imperialist delusion of separate ethnic groups. In Premier Zhdanov's state we are no longer Russian, Kalmyk, Yakut, Turkmen and a myriad of others. We are Soviet and we are one."

SOV_Enshrine_Rykov_Legacy: "Enshrine Rykov's Legacy"
SOV_Enshrine_Rykov_Legacy_desc: "Rykov was a great man, that much is obvious to anyone who knew Russia from before his times and one after he became our Premier. Yet affirming that fact is not enough for our savior and Lenin's greatest follower. Aleksey Rykov shall be put on the pedestal as the example of what all Soviet people should strive for. A new hero for a new nation, alongside V. I Lenin of course."

SOV_Bureaucrat_Every_House: "A Bureaucrat for Every House"
SOV_Bureaucrat_Every_House_desc: "What does a centralized state need? Bureaucrats, of course. And what does a hypercentralized state need? Even more bureaucrats, loyal ones at that. That's exactly why Premier Zhdanov has decreed that every man and woman shall go through basic administrative training, combined with lessons in socialist theory. Alongside that, every city of at least two thousand people will receive a new administrative office, responsible only before the central authorities in the capital."

SOV_Condemn_Bukharinist_Revision: "Condemn Bukharinist Revision"
SOV_Condemn_Bukharinist_Revision_desc: "Nikoaly Bukharin was a fool; the greatest conman our movement has ever seen! He tricked the people of Russia with hollow promises of wealth and prosperity which hid an insidious Capitalist force he directed himself. Andrei Zhdanov, basing his findings upon Rykov's unfinished critiques of the Bukharinist wing, shall expose that truth to the Party as a whole. The legacy of Lenin cannot be spit upon any longer!"

SOV_Final_Nail_NEP: "Final Nail for the NEP"
SOV_Final_Nail_NEP_desc: "Lenin bless Rykov for realizing the errors of the NEP, driving the course of Russia away from the highest form of perversion a social-capitalist ever dreamed of. Sadly, our late leader didn't manage to fully scrub the society clean from the vestiges of the insane contradiction that is `Market Socialism`. That job now falls to Zhdanov, to every true socialist in Russia, to us. The time of the bourgeois economy is over!"

SOV_Central_Commission_State_Planning: "Central Commission of State Planning"
SOV_Central_Commission_State_Planning_desc: "After we smashed the last remains of the crypto-capitalist NEP, many people inside the Party have wondered what system shall we adopt now. Their fears of an uncertain future were quickly dashed by Premier Zhdanov's announcement of the creation of the Central Commission of State Planning, under his recent protégé Nikolay Voznesensky. While the idea itself might be similar to the Gosplan proposed by Zinoviev, TK Gosplan is far more ambitious in its scope."

SOV_Logical_Endpoint_Centralist_Doctrine: "Logical Endpoint of the Centralist Doctrine"
SOV_Logical_Endpoint_Centralist_Doctrine_desc: "With Premier Rykov's hypercentralization scheme well underway, many government spheres were collected in one central place within our capital. However, not everything was included in that superstructure. That's why our grand leader Zhdanov drew up a plan to finalize the Centralist Doctrine by forming a new capital region to organize the whole government apparatus inside it. Tstentrograd shall arise and dwarf every city in the world, proving Socialism's might once again!"

SOV_Zhdanovshchina: "Zhdanovshchina"
SOV_Zhdanovshchina_desc: "With Leninism-Rykovism firmly entrenched in the Soviet nation, the time if finally right for Andrei Zhdanov to introduce his own set of ideas into the government. Zhdanovshchina hinges on a simple realization that the world is split dialectically into two competing realities centered around Soviet democracy and the Capitalist imperialism. Thus the Soviet people have an obligation to improve themselves from good to the best and drive this Western Capitalist scum into extinction."

SOV_Judges_Honour: "Judges of Honour"
SOV_Judges_Honour_desc: "With a system so intricate as ours, it is more than certain that deviations from the ideals of Lenin and Rykov will arise. Such lapses must be combated at every step, lest they threaten to tear the Soviet society apart. This is why Premier Zhdanov authorized the creation of a special People's Commissariat, modeled after the revolutionary VChK, dubbed the 'Judges of Honour' by the more zealous Party members. Their main job is to make sure that the Party itself doesn't stray in any way from the ideological purity presented by Andrei Zhdanov. They are also meant to keep the spirit of Soviet patriotism alive among the ordinary citizens, by any means necessary."

SOV_Silence_Bourgeois_Pragmatist_Lean: "Silence the Bourgeois-Pragmatist Lean"
SOV_Silence_Bourgeois_Pragmatist_Lean_desc: "A rot began to creep into our glorious party, the rot of Techno-Pragmatic revisionism. When we dealt with the crypto-capitalist Bukharinists most of the Party believed the struggle for ideological purity to be over. Yet the greatest among us, Andrei Zhdanov, realized the truth of how the Party may rot in the future. All thanks to that traitor Malenkov, who should have been dealt with the very moment he slithered into a prominent government office after Premier Rykov's death. The time has finally come to cut out the cancer corrupting the hearts and minds of the Party."

SOV_New_Socialist_Reality: "A New Socialist Reality"
SOV_New_Socialist_Reality_desc: "A new Soviet man requires a new Socialist reality to be built for him. That's exactly why Premier Zhdanov initiated the campaign of support for native Soviet artists in forming a new 'Socialist Realism' style, opposed to the rootless cosmopolitanism of the imperialist world. Come, those who see the true beauty revealed to us by Lenin, Rykov and Zhdanov, let us raise a bonfire for West's vanity!"

SOV_All_Reaching_Party_Apparatus_desc: "A truly centralized state uniting all the Soviet people beckons for a unified guiding hand, one in the form of a new ever present party. Premier Zhdanov knows that, and so do his allies scattered across many separate political forces and movements inside our republic. The time has come to unite them all into one entity with powers not yet seen, the All-Union Socialist Party shall arise immediately."

SOV_No_Progress_Without_Ideology: "No Progress without Ideology"
SOV_No_Progress_Without_Ideology_desc: "Our great leader knows one simple truth: we must never allow ourselves to fall into the technocratic perversions formerly championed by Malenkov. Socialism in itself is a science and Leninism-Rykovism is chief among the highest forms of these exact and quantifiable schools of study. Thus, it is only natural that no progress can ever be made without considering the rich and deep impact of Socialism upon technology. With ideology in one hand and science in the other, the Soviet nation shall conquer reality itself!"

SOV_Their_Dream_Forged_Reality: "Their Dream Forged into Reality"
SOV_Their_Dream_Forged_Reality_desc: "All of the people doubting that Andrei Zhdanov could ever achieve his grand vision are once and for all proven wrong. Starting as a disgruntled RKP member and sincer rising to the highest position in the Soviet nation, our dear leader has managed to implement everything Rykov, and thus Lenin, ever wished for. The citizens of our proud Socialist Republic are overjoyed, for they know the Lenin-Rykov-Zhdanov party line is guiding them towards a bright future."

SOV_The_Unions_Rule_The_Party: "Empower Trade Unions Congress"
SOV_The_Unions_Rule_The_Party_desc: "It is time for the VTsSPS to take the reins of power with our great Chairman as its head."

SOV_Decentralisation_Of_Syndicates: "Decentralisation of Syndicates"
SOV_Decentralisation_Of_Syndicates_desc: "As of now the various Syndicates are all coordinated through the All-Russian Congress of Factory Committees. The VSFK also manages various governmental duties like ratifying treaties and approving bills. In short, the VSFK is exceptionally powerful. If a demagogue were to take over the body then the Revolution would be threatened if not totally reversed. To combat their power we will break off many of the local Syndicates, making them answerable to regional bodies rather than directly to the Congress. This will anger many reactionaries within the Congress hoping to undermine all that we have achieved, but they can rage all they want, time marches on regardless."

SOV_Cooperative_Agrarain_Economy: "Cooperative Agrarian Economy"
SOV_Cooperative_Agrarain_Economy_desc: "Many of the farms of Russia sell their crops to the state or to their communities on an individual basis. This has left them vulnerable to price gouging and forces them to race to the bottom in price to beat out their competition. By organizing the farms into broad cooperatives they can sell their crops to the coop at a fair price which will distribute it around as needed. This will become the new foundation of our economy, better than the adhoc agricultural system we staggered with before."

SOV_System_Of_Trade_Unions_And_Soviets: "System of Syndicates and Soviets"
SOV_System_Of_Trade_Unions_And_Soviets_desc: "According to the core program of the Left SR Party, we shall implement the system, known as Syndicates and Soviets. While the political power will be in the hands of elected Soviets, the economic one will be in the hands of elected Syndicates. This will both help industrialize our country without greatly damaging the peasantry."

SOV_Congress_Of_Labor_Collectives: "Councils of Labour Collectives"
SOV_Congress_Of_Labor_Collectives_desc: "As our administration continues to morph into its final form we have found a new opportunity to harness the power of public opinion by forming Councils of Labor Collectives. These local unions will vote on matters of both local and national importance. This will give people more of a say in local and national politics and boost the critically lagging civic pride within Russia."

SOV_Separation_Of_Soviet_Powers: "Separation of Soviet Powers"
SOV_Separation_Of_Soviet_Powers_desc: "Most of the power within our government is centralized in a few key positions and bodies. This was done for expediency as we set up our new administration. However, with the situation stabilized we shall begin to delegate these privileges out to other ministries and positions. With this delegation we will give the government the robustness to withstand the subversion of the right and counterrevolutionaries along with the populism that so frequently leads lofty states such as our astray."

SOV_Soviet_Democracy: "Soviet Democracy"
SOV_Soviet_Democracy_desc: "We have achieved a unique system of state. Instead of our ruler ruling uncontested like in Mitteleuropa or the Entente or relying on reactionary elements of society to pull our strings like in many capitalist ‘democracies’ across the world we have achieved a Peoples State. Across our nation people vote in elections to choose delegates who directly execute their will. Cut off from the temptation of international capital they strive for the best Russia can be, untainted by corruption. What taint of corruption does occasionally seep through the cracks is quickly extracted before it can poison the entire system. The people love us, and we love them back."

SOV_Creation_Of_Ethnic_Soviets: "Question of Ethnic Soviets"
SOV_Creation_Of_Ethnic_Soviets_desc: "Russia is a land of countless ethnicities from the minor to the major. In our new state some have raised the prospect of forming semi-autonomous Soviets to manage these minorities in the best interest of the state. This does bring risk as Nationalists could take control of them and drive a wedge between themselves and our rule. However, if we try and rule them all from our capital within Russia they may cry oppression and give said nationalists power anyway. Whatever our decision is, we must make it soon."

SOV_Rural_Self_Sufficiency: "Rural Self-Sufficiency"
SOV_Rural_Self_Sufficiency_desc: "Our farms have begun making an excess of product. Already we have warehouses of produce slowly spoiling. To avoid massive waste problems we have begun to encourage locals to use their excess produce to further make their rural communities more self-sufficient. This will lower shipping costs while also reinforcing the community bonds that tie our nation together. "

SOV_Peasant_Russia: "Peasant Russia"
SOV_Peasant_Russia_desc: "Our Peasant Farmers are the backbone of our nation. Most of our people toil in the fields almost thanklessly so that we may eat tomorrow. We will not let their honorable sacrifice go unhonored anymore. We shall raise the ideal of the peasant to a new level of honor and prominence that would've been unthinkable under the previous regime. They will be showered with subsidies as well to make them have to work less hard and make more food for the rest of us. These new honors will go a long way in endearing us to this last, biggest class of Russians."

SOV_System_Of_Soviets: "System of Workers' and Peasants' Soviets"
SOV_System_Of_Soviets_desc: "The System of Workers' and Peasants' Soviets, as outlined by narodnik theory shall remain. There's no need to separate economic and political power and let it be shared by the Supreme Congress."

SOV_Powerful_Tradeunionism: "Powerful Trade Union Movement"
SOV_Powerful_Tradeunionism_desc: "The Workers deserve representation! We have mandated the formation of a series of Trade Unions across the nation. These Unions will manage their workplaces as expected however, unlike the Syndicalists, we won't allow them to elect their own to positions of power without some checks. The people, for all their love of the Revolution and the State, are easily influenced. Just one wrong election can bring the entire Revolution into jeopardy. Of course we won't tell them their elections will be slanted to our preferred candidates but they will."

SOV_Public_Healthcare: "Public Healthcare"
SOV_Public_Healthcare_desc: "Healthcare is a right, just as much as food and shelter. Too many Russians die of easily preventable diseases. We shall establish a People's Soviet of Health to oversee the expansion of the public health sector and handle the financial burdens of such an endeavor in a nation as large as ours. Said burden is decried by opponents as too high to meet. When their children are saved by our doctors and they don't have to pay a single ruble, we will see how loud these sociopaths shout."

SOV_Universal_Education: "Universal Education"
SOV_Universal_Education_desc: "The average Russian has a very low education level, usually just a bit of primary school and in exceptional circumstances, some secondary school as well. However, this cannot remain true. In a world that grows more and more advanced by leaps and bounds every year we cannot afford to lag behind. If we do, then the reactionaries of the world will crush us under their boots. That is why all education will be free and mandatory up to university and college itself will be subsidised so that most people can attend at least some. With a new generation of intelligent and educated citizens we will remain at the cutting edge of society and remain competitive on the world stage. "

SOV_Ensure_Universeal_Employment: "Ensure Universal Employment"
SOV_Ensure_Universeal_Employment_desc: "The New Man should not worry about where his next paycheck will come from. We cannot stand by while many millions of Russians struggle for a single ruble. No, we shall make employment mandatory and available to all. Some point out that our economy is simply not large enough to have enough jobs for every single person, but we shall brush this problem away easily. We shall simply create jobs. A job is a job, no more. As long as it pays then someone will take it. They have to after all."

SOV_Freedom_Of_Socialist_Print: "Freedom of the Socialist Press"
SOV_Freedom_Of_Socialist_Print_desc: "We shall enshrine the freedom of the Socialist press. Those Socialist news outlets in every medium who diligently report the truth to the people will face no interference from Central Authorities. However, those rags who try and defame our every move require a lot of oversight from the government and that will continue just as diligently."

SOV_Abolish_Cheka: "Abolish the Cheka"
SOV_Abolish_Cheka_desc: "The Cheka had its uses. It was pivotal in rooting out counterrevolutionary terrorists and controlling the unruly propulace. However, with our policies paying dividends to everybody, resistance to our regime has shrunk to such a degree that the Cheka are hardly necessary anymore. Some worry about just how the still powerful Cheka will take this, but we know as loyal Soviets they will recognize the necessity of their dissolution and leave peacefully."

SOV_Question_Of_Kulaks: "Question of the Kulaks"
SOV_Question_Of_Kulaks_desc: "While we have made great strides in breaking up the private property, there are still many who hold onto their estates. These kulaks have however reformed to more faithfully fit the new system, most likely to keep from getting rounded up rather than out of a kindness of their own hearts. Some have suggested we finish what we have begun and strike these remnants down. We can break up their estates and give them to the peasant cooperatives. Others point out that the remaining kulaks are less the exploitative lords overlooking their innumerable peasants that the radicals paint them to be and are instead more or less cooperatives just not under a state appointed leader. They also point out that the system works fine. Such a severe disruption as breaking up the farms could lead to a famine. Nevertheless the decision is ultimately ours to make."

SOV_Welfare_State: "SR Welfare State"
SOV_Welfare_State_desc: "We have formed a robust welfare state. The people rejoice in finally enjoying the fruits of their labor. Meanwhile they don’t fear going to the hospital or getting a disease. Such fears plagued our people under the despots of the Tsar and Kerensky. Now however with our public health network expanding and more and more people taking advantage of it, our nation's overall health is rising which in turn raises productivity. All in all, things could not have gone better."

SOV_Socialist_Humanism: "Socialist Humanism"
SOV_Socialist_Humanism_desc: "Many governments prioritise the state over the people. They view their citizens as pawns to be thrown into the woodchipper to make the lines go up and put money in their pockets. Our focus on the people of Russia and improving their lives not only has endeared us to the populace but has shown to the world that focusing on the populace is if not required then highly beneficial. Our economy booms, our military is growing stronger by the day and our industry pumps out more material every day than it did the day before. All of this done by a people who know their government loves them and only acts in their best interests."

SOV_Left_SR_Chekist_Coup: "Chekist Coup"
SOV_Left_SR_Chekist_Coup_desc: "The treacherous politicians tried to dismantle their shield against the enemies of the revolution. This could not have been done by any sane man, any true SR. That must mean that the Party has been corrupted by reactionaries and for who knows for how long. That is why we did what we did. To safeguard the Revolution."

SOV_Shadow_Government: "Shadow Government"
SOV_Shadow_Government_desc: "To rule directly would be a mistake. The people disapprove of our coup overwhelmingly. If we sat in the big seat, it would only invite more trouble. Instead we shall install a public face of our new regime instead. Of course he will know who is the real power behind the throne and we will overthrow him just as easily as we overthrew those other traitors. However, with him in charge instead of us, our new regime gets a degree of stability that it couldn’t have gotten before."

SOV_Institutionalize_Terror: "Institutionalize Terror"
SOV_Institutionalize_Terror_desc: "The people are nearly riotous still over our seizure of power. We must secure the regime against counter revolutionaries both within and outside our state. We shall dispatch the Cheka into the streets to find the instigators of this continued unrest and put an end to their charade of ‘restoring power to the people’. While we do our work the Army will crush what resistance remains. When all goes to plan we should have full compliance within a month or so of the operations beginning. Civilian casualties are projected to be within acceptable boundaries."

SOV_Soviets_Without_Parties: "Soviets Without Parties"
SOV_Soviets_Without_Parties_desc: "The Soviets are critical and solid pillars of our society. To do away with them entirely would bring anarchy. However they have been tainted by counterrevolutionaries in the Party and must be cleansed. Instead the Soviets will work entirely for the benefit of the state, free from all party affiliation while naturally still under close Cheka surveillance. Dissension can begin at any time so we must remain eternally vigilant. "

SOV_Establish_Osoaviakhim: "Establish Osoaviakhim"
SOV_Establish_Osoaviakhim_desc: "By National Decree we have established the Osoaviakhim. The Organization will be a volunteer militia of sorts which will draft Soviet citizens to fill gaps in various military organizations to allow for more men to be focused on combat operations. These citizens will be chosen by lottery to ensure complete fairness. As we prepare our great struggle we must focus all our military forces on the coming conflagration."

SOV_Bring_Back_The_Draft: "Bring Back the Draft"
SOV_Bring_Back_The_Draft_desc: "The draft was first instituted in our republic in the mid to closing days of the Civil War as the state slowly collapsed and casualties mounted. In the coming war we must prepare for severe casualties as well. We will begin to draft citizens into the Army en masse. This will be deeply unpopular, just as it was during the Civil War, and we predict that we will have to use a fair bit of coercion to get the men to answer the call. However, as our armies advance inexorably forward they will rally under our banners and then we will have no problems finding more eager soldiers for the military of tomorrow."

SOV_War_Against_Oppressors: "War Against Oppressors"
SOV_War_Against_Oppressors_desc: "The time is upon us! We must strike now at the international bourgeois to secure our state forevermore! As long as there are reactionaries on our border we will be at constant risk for subversion and destruction. We will march on until there are none left to oppose us! We will weather every challenge, overcome any losses and defeat any enemy. When all is said and done and the world proletariat is finally free then we will look back on these coming times of strife as a necessary trial, the Final Struggle."

SOV_Left_SR_Countercoup: "Legalist Counter-Coup"
SOV_Left_SR_Countercoup_desc: "The Cheka coup has plunged the nation into thinly veiled anarchy. State Terror has pitted brother and brother, mother against child and husband against wife. The Russian People are fearful and suspicious of everybody, especially each other. Since we have destroyed the Cheka and restored sanity to the nation, such suspicion is lifting but still hangs over us like a heavy blanket. We must work to restore order and trust between the people and government and between the people and their neighbors. Without these basic building blocks of society our nation is lost to anarchy."

SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power: "Give Up Monopoly On Power"
SOV_Give_Up_Monopoly_On_Power_desc: "The Cheka consolidated power to an extreme degree leaving the entire state dependent on the executive and his puppet masters. Now that we are in charge we will do away with this. We will restore the previous balance of power by re-delegating key responsibilities to the restored ministries and branches of government. With the government no longer entirely dependent on one man we can act faster and restore the democracy which has long been little more than a facade."

SOV_No_Need_In_Terror: "Abandon Terror"
SOV_No_Need_In_Terror_desc: "Under the Cheka mass executions of suspected enemies of the state were commonplace. Hundreds died in cities across the nation every day and ammunition was expended in such numbers that in some areas the local Cheka death squads returned to sabers and clubs to do the deed due to a lack of ammunition. As the story of the Cheka comes to its merciful close we will also abandon the state sanctioned terror they brought with them. We will loosen the stringent restraints on people's lives, eliminate the death squads entirely and instead restore the local police forces that had for some time now fallen by the wayside."

SOV_Elect_The_New_Chairman: "Elect the New Chairman"
SOV_Elect_The_New_Chairman_desc: "Our mission is complete. The government has been restored, people are learning to trust one another again and the Cheka have been broken and destroyed in totality. There is no longer any threat of them ever rising again and we have taken steps to make sure any future government never makes the same mistake we did. Now, we have only one mission left: turn over leadership back to the civilian government. While some have entertained the notion of a permanent State of Emergency to rule that idea lasted about as long as a daisy on the tundra. We are here to restore democracy, not destroy it. To finalize the return to normalcy we shall organize a new election for a new chairman, restored to full powers by us."

RUS_Mobilise_Urban_Militias_desc: "The cities have been the heart land of the revolution ever since the beginning, they were the birth ground of it. We will mobilize militias from the cities to serve in the revolution and allow for the spread of it, because if we do not mobilize large swaths of the population fast, the revolution may be crushed by the reactionaries."

RUS_Rally_The_Defectors: "Rally the Defectors"
RUS_Rally_The_Defectors_desc: "Many in the Russian army are dissatisfied with the status quo, which makes them perfect to recruit to the revolution, so they can serve in a true attempt to change the status quo and improve the life of the population and make the army serve the people, not the bankers."

RUS_The_War_Effort: "The War Effort"
RUS_The_War_Effort_desc: "The early days of the revolution have left our military command structure in disarray. Factions and ideological differences have led to a lack of coordination and direction within our land forces.. We will need to organize the revolutionary war effort, as it has been a pure disaster beforehand. We will re-establish much of the bureaucracy and state apparatus which was destroyed in the wake of the failure of the First Civil War. "
RUS_Revolutionary_Indoctrination: "Revolutionary Indoctrination"

RUS_Local_Defense_Militias: "Local Defense Militias"
RUS_Local_Defense_Militias_desc: "Empower local communities to form their own defense militias, adding a layer of decentralized defense. While effective in localized threats, this approach hampers overall strategic coordination."

RUS_Rebuild_The_Red_Army: "Rebuild the Red Army"
RUS_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army will have to be rebuild, if we want to win this revolution. A centralized army proved itself to be a capable fighting force the first time around, it will be a capable one the second time around too, though we should avoid the failures of and mistakes of the first incarnation."
RUS_Rebuild_The_Red_Army_tt: "When the Civil War is over, we will demobilize all Red Guard units."
RUS_Establish_SVR: "Establish the GRU"
RUS_Establish_SVR_desc: "Although Russia had many internal security services, their main purpose was to keep the peace at home, something which is of no use for an army that moves forward far beyond the borders. That's exactly why we need to create a new agency, integrated into and serving the military, to focus on the civilian side of warfare on foreign soil. The time has come to create the Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU for short."
RUS_Centralised_Command: "Centralised Command Structure"
RUS_Centralised_Command_desc: "A centralised command is necessary in a military combat, any other alternative would just result in total disaster, something we need to avoid at all costs.

RUS_The_Second_Red_Army: "The Second Red Army"
RUS_The_Second_Red_Army_desc: "The Red Army will be rebuild, as it was a great display of proletarian power, even if it was defeated at the end. However, the solution is to rebuild the Red Army and learn from its failure, not to reject the Red Army and the principles it was founded on."

RUS_Empower_The_Krasnaya_Gvardiya_desc: "We will need to create a bottom-up form of army, an army which is truly representative of the revolutionary spirit. We will support the democratic election of commanders too, even if it will cause some issues at times, as the local soldiers probably know better who should command them then some people far away from the situation."
RUS_Decentralised_Structure: "Decentralised Structure"

RUS_Small_Unit_Tactics: "Small Unit Tactics"
RUS_Small_Unit_Tactics_desc: "Instead of using masses of troops, using small units allows for us to be far quicker in our attacks and surprise than if we use a large amount of units. This will also give us more easily the element of surprise, than if we use many units."
SOV_Guerilla_Warfare: "Partisan Warfare"
SOV_Guerilla_Warfare_desc: "The Red Guards are primarily volunteers, which means they must be able not only to mobilize quickly and effectively, but also to act behind enemy lines.

RUS_Frunzes_Reform_Plan_desc: "With the revolution secured, for now, we can focus on other matters. Frunze has proposed that we should focus on improving the high command and officer training and generally improve the defence of the army against a possible invasion, a real threat, as the forces of reaction will probably try to end the revolution in the future."
RUS_Expand_The_High_Command: "Expand the High Command"
RUS_Expand_The_High_Command_desc: "The high command will need to be expanded to include many of the best generals we have, who were all able to show their skill in the Second Russian Revolution. Only a high command truly including the best of the best will be able to do intelligent decisions."
